Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime First Impressions. Ankit Chawla , 19 January 2018. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime will be exclusively available via Amazon India. The Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime looks a lot like the Galaxy J7 Prime. It sports a 5.5-inch full-HD display with a 16:9 aspect ratio. It has been priced starting at Rs 12,990 and will go on sale from Jan 20. Samsung has launched the Galaxy On7 Prime in the sub-Rs. The smartphone is reminiscent of the Galaxy J7 Prime but differs in a few ways. The key features of the Galaxy On7 Prime include Samsung Pay Mini , Samsung Mall , and 13-megapixel front and rear cameras. The Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime has been priced at Rs. 12,990 for the 3GB RAM/ 32GB storage variant, and Rs. 14,990 for the 4GB RAM/ 64GB storage model. It will be available starting January 20, exclusively on Amazon.in, in tandem with the recently launched Galaxy A8+ (2018) .. This new phone also runs the latest Samsung Experience 8.5 UI based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat. There are some unique software features and preinstalled apps that could help the new model. compete with the likes of the Xiaomi Mi A1 , Lenovo K8 Note , and Nokia 5. We spent some time with the smartphone. at its launch event, and here are our. Before digging into the specifications, we have to talk about a new feature that Samsung has introduced for the first time in India. Called Samsung Mall, this new app is being pitched as an all-in-one shopping platform to help users find products across multiple e-commerce websites. Users can take a photo of a product, or choose one from their gallery, and the app will use image recognition to try to identify it.. In our brief initial tests at Samsung's launch event, this feature did not work for the objects we tried matching, and we found it difficult to frame shots, but we will reserve further judgement until we've had a chance to test it during our review process.. However, it did recognise some popular smartphones including a Google Pixel 2 and an iPhone 7 Plus, and like all machine learning algorithms, it could get better over time.. Moving on to the design of the Galaxy On7 Prime, this phone looks a lot like the previously launched Galaxy J7 Prime. It has the same metal unibody, which feels sturdy. It weighs 167 grams, which is decent enough considering the all-metal design, and is distributed evenly. The handset measures 151.7mm tall, 75mm wide, and 8mm thick.. On the front, it features a 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) PLS TFT LCD screen with a regular 16:9 aspect ratio display. It has a 2.5D curved-edge glass that gives the phone a premium feel. The display, much like most other Samsung smartphones, offers good viewing angles, strong brightness, and good colour reproduction.. Below the display is a physical home button, with a capacitive key on either side - one for multitasking and the other for navigating back. The Home button houses the fingerprint sensor, and having it on the front is a rarity for Android smartphones these days. In our initial experience, the fingerprint sensor was fast, responsive, and mostly accurate. Above the display is the 13-megapixel front shooter with f/1.9 aperture. The front camera took natural images and did not unnecessarily use faux editing to "beautify" faces. Samsung has incorporated a new 'Stickers' feature that offers functionality similar to the stickers found in apps such as Instagram and Snapchat.. The metal back of the Galaxy On7 Prime also has a single 13-megapixel camera with an f/1.9 aperture and autofocus. Strangely, the autofocus on the camera seemed inconsistent and we struggled to take macro shots in our limited initial tests. Samsung has promised good low-light performance for both cameras, and while we were unable to test that at the launch event, we will examine this claim in detail in our full review.. The back of the smartphone has been kept fairly minimal, with only the camera, LED flash, and Samsung branding visible. The metal body offers a good grip.. The Galaxy On7 Prime features a loudspeaker and a power/ lock button on the right. On the left is a volume rocker, a compartment for SIM 1 (Nano), and a second compartment for SIM 2 (Nano) as well as a microSD card. The bottom of the device has a Micro-USB port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and the primary microphone.. At the core of the Galaxy On7 Prime is a 64-bit octa-core Samsung Exynos 7870 SoC, with all eight cores clocked at 1.6GHz. The Exynos 7870 is the latest mid-range processor from Samsung and we will test its performance in our upcoming review. The smartphone comes in two variants - 3GB RAM/ 32GB storage, and 4GB RAM/ 64GB storage. We had the variant with 4GB of RAM to examine at the launch event, and there was no significant lag or stutter.. Expectedly, the smartphone runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat with the Samsung Experience 8.5 UI on top. There is no official word on the likelihood of an Android 8.0 Oreo Update, although we are optimistic since the Galaxy J7 Prime is expected to get a beta update soon.. Apart from the exclusive Samsung Mall feature, the Galaxy On7 Prime supports Samsung Pay Mini, which integrates with online wallets and UPI. We could not test this feature due to a lack of Internet connectivity at the launch event. The smartphone also has other Samsung software features including a one-handed mode, shortcuts for the camera app, multi-window and split screen multitasking, and Smart Alerts to let you know about missed calls and messages when you pick up the phone. Additionally, the Galaxy On7 Prime comes with Microsoft apps including Office and LinkedIn, as well as the usual Google apps such as Gmail, YouTube, etc.. The Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime has a 3300mAh battery under the hood, which we will soon test for ourselves..

The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone.

With the Galaxy On7 Prime , Samsung is going after its biggest competitor in India. The company wonât accept it outright , but Xiaomi has probably given Samsung execs in the country many sleepless nights as it has taken over the budget segment of the smartphone market with devices that carry dirt cheap price tags for the kind of hardware they offer. In fact, Xiaomi has also come a long way when it comes to offering after-sales support, and these days, thereâs pretty much no reason why you wouldnât want to get a Xiaomi smartphone over a Samsung device in the sub-Rs. The Korean giant isnât shying away from trying, though. The Galaxy On7 Prime is the companyâs latest attempt to offer something close to the value-for-money proposition of Xiaomiâs budget handsets, and also those offered by many other Chinese OEMs. When you look at the price tag, the On7 Prime certainly has an impressive spec sheet. A Full HD display, 13MP cameras on the front and back, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage at Rs.. 14,990 (roughly $230) is nothing to scoff at when you consider Samsungâs usual specs-to-price ratio. 2,000 ($30) less, you get the same specs but reduced RAM and storage (3GB and 32GB).. The Galaxy On7 Prime also comes with Samsung Mall , an app that lets users point the phoneâs camera at a product and see related items on various online stores. Itâs like Bixby Vision, only the Mall app also lets you buy products from various stores without leaving the app. Samsung Mall isnât going to be exclusive to this phone, but Samsung is still using it as a marketing highlight.. How well does Samsung Mall work, though, and does the On7 Prime have what it takes to be a viable alternative in the immensely crowded budget smartphone market in India? Well, letâs find out in this review.. The Galaxy On7 Prime, for the most part, is a rebadged Galaxy J7 Prime. The back of the phone, with its camera placement, is the same as the J7 Primeâs. The front, meanwhile, is the same old setup Samsung uses on any phone that doesnât have an Infinity display. What I like is that on our gold review unit, the front side of the phone is colored a deep shade of brown, which looks classy. Where Samsung has cut costs are the capacitive back and recent apps buttons. These arenât backlit, so you might find yourself tapping the back button a couple of times in the dark to make it work.. The phone has a metal unibody design that feels good in the hand. Itâs not too light, but itâs not very heavy, either. The same goes for the phoneâs thickness. Itâs rather slim but doesnât skimp on features. You get two SIM slots, a microSD slot, and a 3,300 mAh battery just like the J7 Prime. The home button doubles up as a fingerprint sensor thatâs always active, so thereâs no need to press the home button to unlock the phone. Oh, and thereâs a notification LED as well, a feature that Samsung finally seems to be making a standard across its lineup .. The Galaxy On7 Prime doesnât get an AMOLED display, which, despite the low price tag, is disappointing. The 5.5-inch Full HD LCD screen isnât bad. Itâs sharp, has fairly vibrant colors, wide viewing angles, and good brightness levels, but itâs still an LCD panel that canât match the beauty of an AMOLED panel. Thereâs no ambient light sensor on this phone, either. Itâs been a long-standing omission on Samsungâs budget phones, but in this day and age, itâs a major point of contention and utterly inexcusable.. Also odd is the companyâs decision to omit the blue light filter option, just as it had done on the Galaxy J7 Max , another device that debuted in India. Itâs a standard software feature on Android these days, and thereâs no reason other than a half-hearted attempt at putting things together for Samsung India to be leaving the blue light filter out.. The display also acts up sometimes and doesnât properly register taps. This was most noticeable when trying to use the phone while it was in my carâs mount, and judging by other reviews, it doesnât look like itâs a problem limited to my unit.. Iâll come straight to the point here: The 13-megapixel rear and front cameras (F1.9 aperture on both) on the On7 Prime are good when the lightingâs right, and too prone to camera shake in other conditions. The camera shake issue is a long-standing one for any non-flagship Samsung phone in recent years, and you have to muster all your will to hold the camera steady enough to get clear pictures indoors and in poor lighting. When the pictures do come out steady, they are pretty good for a budget phone. Daylight pictures, in particular, come out well detailed and noise-free with the rear camera. For pictures against bright light or the skies, the dedicated HDR mode is very useful, even though it requires you to stand still for a second or two till the phone is done saving the HDR image.. You can get good pictures indoors as well, but again, provided you hold the phone steady enough. Colors arenât very punchy, though, and even HDR photos canât always provide you with enough detail in the dark areas of the scene. For low-light scenes, you can manually reduce the sceneâs exposure for better shots. Thereâs also a dedicated night mode that can help capture more light than normal, but it almost never produces results that arenât messed up by camera shake. Not that itâs surprising that pictures donât come well in the dark, as budget phones are still some ways off from getting high-end imaging sensors, especially when you talk of Samsungâs lineup, where every bit of cost-cutting counts.. The selfie camera is a good performer outdoors during the daytime, just like the rear camera. The pictures donât offer as much detail as youâd like from a 13-megapixel camera, but it captures skin tones quite well and produces realistic colors. Performance isnât great in low light, and once again, the result depends on how steady you hold the phone. Sadly, you need an iron grip to get clean selfies in tough lighting conditions, and I failed at that in almost every selfie that I didnât take outdoors on a bright and sunny day.. The Galaxy On7 Prime also comes with Selfie focus , a software-based bokeh feature. It doesnât work very well; the phone seems to have issues clearly defining where your head and body end and where the background begins. Itâs especially bad when you have something big in the background, like the car you can see in one of the samples below. Having multiple people in the scene helps, but only because the camera doesnât have as much of a background to blur in that case.. The On7 Primeâs cameras have another trick up their sleeve, and thatâs the social sharing feature. Once you tap the social share button in the camera, you can add contacts from WhatsApp and other social networks. Then, every picture you take gets added to the queue for a particular contact; once youâre done taking all the pictures you want to share, you send them across with a single tap. This removes the need to go and select those images from the gallery later on. Not something everyone will use, but if you regularly share pictures with friends and family at events, parties, and elsewhere, it might appeal to you.. Note: The original camera samples can be seen in full resolution in this Google Photos album .. Like any other budget phone from Samsung (or even a mid-range one from a year or so ago), the On7 Prime gets an SoC thatâs geared solely towards power efficiency instead of performance. The Exynos 7870 has eight Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.6GHz. Thankfully, the 4GB of RAM on our review unit helped keep things running smoothly for the most part in day-to-day usage. The hiccups arise when you try to switch between two apps (by double tapping the recent apps key) in a hurry; apps also take some time to open. For example, youâll often see the intro splash screen in Samsungâs proprietary apps, like the Phone or Gallery app, before they load. This happens despite the 4GB of RAM, so Iâm guessing the processor gets a major part of the blame.. I also ran into some stutter after extended periods of usage, so maybe the RAM management is an issue as well, making me wonder how well the 3GB RAM variant performs. For gaming, donât expect high-end titles to have good frame rates; the Full HD resolution no doubt becomes a bit too much to handle for the processor. As for that fingerprint sensor, itâs a hit and miss when it comes to how quickly it responds to your finger when the phone is locked and the screen is off. It can be almost instant at times, but it can also completely miss out on detection and require you to try again on other occasions.. The Galaxy On7 Prime gets a side-mounted loudspeaker, similar to most of Samsungâs budget and mid-range phones in recent months, but the company seems to have opted for a lower-quality component for the On7 Prime. The speaker isnât very loud, and it produces tinny sound that, at times, feels distorted even at less than the highest volume levels. That means using earphones with this device is a must, only Samsung decided to not include a pair in the box. Clearly a cost-cutting measure, and while we werenât able to test quality over basic earphones, performance was lacking on the AKG earphones that come bundled with the S8 and Note 8. Thereâs next to no bass, and things sound shrill and uncomfortable unless youâre listening to modern tracks with good bit rates.. Call quality was acceptable, with clearly audible voices on both ends of a call. Network reception can be problematic in basements and underground parking lots; the phone seems to continue to hold on to the network in such areas, but calls or mobile data donât actually work. Thankfully, itâs not a problem in other areas, and both the first and second SIM get good reception as long as you stay at ground level.. The Galaxy On7 Prime has no issues lasting an entire day and on to the next morning with light to medium usage. Heavy, continuous usage will bring down battery life to less than a day, although getting the phone to drop down to critical battery levels was a rare occasion for me. Of course, navigation via Google Maps and gaming for extended periods can shorten endurance by a few hours, but thatâs to be expected from the 3,300 mAh battery.. Fast charging isnât supported on the Galaxy On7 Prime, and a full top-up from below 10 percent battery takes a little over two hours.. There are a handful of power saving modes built-in, including something called S Power Planning. We saw this feature on the Galaxy J7 Prime, and Iâll just point you to its review if you want more details. Basically, S Power Planning can save battery by limiting the phone to only calls or enable call forwarding when battery charge is extremely low. I never found myself needing to use any of these, but coupled with the usually dependable battery life on the J7 Prime, the power saving modes should come handy when you really need to conserve the phoneâs charge levels.. The Galaxy On7 Prime runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat with the Samsung Experience 8.5 UX, the same as the one that you find on the Galaxy Note 8. The features are limited compared to the flagships, but still aplenty. Theme support, Multi Window multitasking, Dual Messenger for using two accounts in apps that donât support multiple accounts, Secure Folder, and Bixby Vision are some of the features you get. The home screen works through swipes: an up or down swipe to go into the app drawer and a swipe to the right to launch Bixby Home. You can also put all app shortcuts on the home screen by disabling the app drawer, which can be useful if youâre moving from a smartphone from Xiaomi or another Chinese OEM that doesnât use app drawers.. The phone also comes with Samsung Pay Mini. Samsung Pay Mini only supports wallets such as Paytm and Indiaâs Unified Payments Interface (UPI) service, so itâs far from useful if youâre already using dedicated apps for that. As far as software updates are concerned, I received one update during the review period that didnât seem to change anything, not even the latest security patch (the phone still runs the August security patch). It remains to be seen if Samsung will bring Oreo to the On7 Prime. If it does, itâs likely to take a long time; Android P will probably be out by then.. Samsung Mall is a headline feature of the Galaxy On7 Prime, though itâs not limited to this device and will run on other phones as well. The app is a take on Bixby Vision and goes one step further. Samsung Mall lets you add items to a cart and purchase them from various online stores, such as Amazon, Flipkart, Jabong, and Tata Cliq, without leaving the app. But, the checkout process is a bit long-winded. For each item you add, you must go through the storeâs webpage through the built-in browser, log in to that store if you have an account (a must if you want to use Amazon Prime, for example), make the payment, then repeat the entire process for a product from another store.. Samsung Mall also lets you take pictures of items and see related products online (in addition to using voice search), but itâs a hit-and-miss affair. Taking a photo of a pillow shows results for blankets and towels, which is fairly acceptable, but take a photo of the Galaxy S7 edge and Samsung Mall will throw up results for a Motorola phone and cases for other devices. Trying to see results for laptops seemed to work well, although unnecessary results still show up.. The primary benefit I saw with Samsung Mall is that it regularly threw up voucher codes for various stores as notifications and also curates deals on the main landing page. The visual search through the camera might improve later on, but as it stands right now, youâre better off using dedicated shopping apps for each store.. Iâll be honest: The Galaxy On7 Prime isnât a great budget phone, even if. itâs Samsungâs best budget phone yet for the asking price.. But there isnât anything that stands out in particular. What does stand out is the fact that thereâs still no ambient light sensor, or that the phone isnât powerful enough to run high-end games. The cameras are good in natural light but produce blurry images in other conditions, and the audio quality leaves much to be desired. The battery life is great, but thatâs not a unique feature in this day and age.. If your budget is limited to Rs. 15,000, and you must have a Samsung phone, the On7 Prime is okay. But if your allegiances donât lie with a particular company, you have alternatives like the Xiaomi Mi A1, which runs Android One and therefore gets direct updates from Google. It also has a better spec sheet, although the software features pale in comparison to Samsungâs offering. But Xiaomi has a good alternative in that case as well: The Redmi Note 4 costs much less and runs MIUI, which is as feature-packed as the Samsung Experience UX.. If you can increase your budget, the Galaxy J7 Max is a better option, even though it doesnât have the best software performance. For slightly more money, you can also opt for the Galaxy J7 Pro , which is a complete package that includes an AMOLED display and the full-fledged version of Samsung Pay. Again, if you canât modify your budget, you could do worse than the Galaxy On7 Prime. But you could also do much better, so make sure to take a look at all options before spending your hard-earned money.. Reviews Galaxy On7 Prime India Samsung Mall.

The Samsung Galaxy On7 is a budget smartphone priced at below 15000 from the Korean smartphone vendor. The device does have its merits in spite of the basic hardware configurations.. Samsung has given the device a 5.5-inch TFT display to cut costs, instead of the usual Super AMOLED displays their devices come with that are better than TFTs in terms of performance under direct sunlight and displaying colors. Nevertheless, the screen on the On7 is sufficient for playing games, watching videos, and surfing the internet. The HD resolution on the device displays content with brightness and legibility even while out in the direct sun. Unfortunately, the phone lacks Gorilla Glass protection found on almost all the other devices that fall in this price segment. In terms of design, the Galaxy On7 looks similar to other mid and low range devices from Samsung with a brushed metal frame sandwiched between a leather back and an all glass front. The device comes in two colour variants: white and black. The Samsung Galaxy On7 measures 8.2 mm thick. The device is quite heavy at 172 grams.. The device runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with Samsungâs TouchWiz skin which adds plenty of features on top of stock Android by Google.

Photographs are taken by a 13-megapixel rear camera with LED flash which includes modes like panorama and HDR. The image quality is acceptable and the camera struggles in low-light but that is usual for devices in this price range. There is a 5-megapixel front-facing camera with f/2.2 aperture. To enhance secondary camera images, the camera features beauty shot and wide selfie features. The Samsung Galaxy On7 is backed by a 3,000 mAh Li-Ion battery that carries enough power to keep your device awake for a whole working day with moderate to heavy usage. Samsung has rated the device to provide 21 hours of talk time on 3G networks.. As far as connectivity is concerned, the device comes with dual-SIM card slot with LTE support on both of them, in addition to Bluetooth 4.1, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, GPS, GLONASS, BDS and a microUSB 2.0 port..

Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime first impressions: Can it beat Xiaomi Redmi Note. Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime with Samsung Mall has been launched in India starting at a price of Rs 12,990. Here's our first impression of Samsung's latest smartphone.. Technology Mobile & Tabs Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime first impressions: Can it beat Xiaomi Redmi Note. Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime first impressions: The phone comes with a new app called Samsung Mall and it has been launched in India starting at a price of Rs 12,990. Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime has 13MP rear camera on the back. Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime is powered by a 1.59GHz octa-core Exynos 7870 processor coupled with either 3GB or 4GB RAM. Perhaps the highlight of the Galaxy On7 Prime is the Samsung Mall app.. Updated: January 18, 2018 1:38 pm. The mid-end segment smartphone segment in India is currently dominated by Chinese players, like Xiaomi , Oppo and Vivo. The Rs 10,000 â 15,000 price range is a critical one driving volumes, and thereâs so much competition here. The Redmi Note 4 is a preferred choice for many in this price bracket, thanks to its fast processor, likable design, and balanced performance.. However, Samsung believes their latest Galaxy On7 Prime offers the best value under the Rs 15,000 price mark. And the reason for the confidence is not the phoneâs hardware, but an app called Samsung Mall. Fire up the app on the device, tap the camera option, and then point and shoot at items you might want to buy or get pricing information and so on. Your phone will be able to figure out what you are looking at, it will pull up listings from a number of online shopping sites with pricing.. Available in two variants, and retailing for Rs 12,990 and Rs 14,990 respectively, Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime will be available exclusively on Amazon India and Samsung Shop. The first sale will go live on January 20 during the âAmazon Great Indian Saleâ. But is it enough to beat Xiaomi as the king of the mid-range smartphones? Letâs find out in our first impression of the Galaxy On7 Prime.. Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime: Design and display. The Galaxy On7 Prime continues to feature a metal unibody design that looks and feel just as premium as the Redmi Note 4. However, this design is not something drastically different, but I would not call it a deal-breaker for now. Below the display, thereâs a physical home button that doubles as a fingerprint sensor. On either side of the home button are navigation keys.. Like most of Samsungâs phones, the power button is on the right side, and the two volume buttons are on the left side. On the bottom of the phone is a micro USB port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Both the variants of the Galaxy On7 Prime are available in two colours: Graphite Black and Champagne Gold.. The Galaxy On7 Prime has a 5.5-inch Full HD 1,920 x 1,080 resolution display. This is a regular LCD screen and not a Super AMOLED one. Unlike the Honor 9 Lite or Micromax Canvas Infinity, both of which use the 18:9 aspect ratio display, Samsung has still not come out with a phone with an extra tall screen in this price segment. I spent a short amount of time with the Galaxy On7 Prime, but the phoneâs 5.5-inch display appears vivid, and the contrast is excellent.. Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime: Performance and Battery. Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime is powered by a 1.59GHz octa-core Exynos 7870 processor coupled with either 3GB or 4GB RAM (depending on which model you end up buying). There is also microSD card support, and you have a choice of 32GB or 64GB storage capacities. The Galaxy On7 Prime comes with a pretty sizable 3300mAh battery, which should last a day on a single charge.. During my brief time spent with the Galaxy On7 Prime, the phone felt snappy and responsive. Of course, the real test begins when you actually start using the phone on a regular basis filled with apps, watching videos, and using for intensive tasks. Unfortunately, the Galaxy On7 Prime doesnât come with Android 8.0 Oreo, running instead of the older Android 7.0 Nougat.. Samsungâs native UI is simple and clean; and less of a gimmick. Interestingly, the phone also comes with the Bixby AI-assistant which can be accessed through by swiping right of the screen. We couldnât test the feature due to iffy internet connectivity at the venue.. Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime features 13MP snapper on both the front and the back. Both cameras have f/1.9 aperture and phase detection auto focus. The primary camera does not seem to impress, making some shots unusable. The auto-focus can also be a bit off sometimes, which is another issue with the camera. Still I am not jumping to the conclusions just yet. I will test the camera in detail when I starting reviewing the device.. Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime : Samsung Mall. Perhaps the highlight of the Galaxy On7 Prime is the Samsung Mall app. The app uses the phoneâs camera and augmented reality (AR) capabilities to identify objects in real time and search for them online. For example, if you were at the store looking for a pair of shoes; all you need to do is point the camera towards the product and the app would automatically look up the price, info, and best online deals.. Plus, you can also search and shop for products across multiple online shopping sites from one single app. At the point, Samsung has tied up with four partners for Samsung Mall â Amazon India, Jabong , Shopclues , and Tata CLiQ. In my brief testing, the app showed accurate results for most objects and so far looks like an impressive feature.. Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime: Early verdict. While the Galaxy On7 Prime might not be a notable change from the companyâs past phones in the mid-end segment, I would still argue company did a great job by installing something like the Samsung Mall app. Seeing the Galaxy On7 Prime and Samsung Mall together is interesting. However, whether that combination works is another question..

Please enable JavaScript to view comments.. Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime Launched in India with Samsung Mall, Starts at Rs. Samsung is doing well in the Indian smartphone market , but itâs coming under increasing pressure from the likes of Xiaomi. In the third quarter of 2017, Xiaomi tied Samsung for first place in the Indian smartphone market with 23.5 percent market share, according to IDC. announced last week it would launch a phone in India : The Galaxy On7 Prime. And at an event on Wednesday, the company formally announced the phone for India.. The Galaxy On7 Prime broke cover on Samsungâs UAE website a few weeks back, but the variant launched in India is a bit different. It has a 13MP front camera (the model sold in the UAE has an 8MP front camera), a new icon for the recent apps menu, and a new visual search feature called Samsung Mall.. Samsung Mall is similar to Bixby Vision on Samsungâs flagship devices. It lets users take a photo of a product (or use a photo in their gallery) and compare prices for that product across multiple shopping sites using the âAll-in-one Shoppingâ tab. Users can then purchase the product via Samsung Mallâs âUniversal Cartâ feature, which allows them to add and review products from different sites in a single cart.. Samsung says that Samsung Mall will come to more phones in the future.. The Galaxy On7 Prime is a mid-range handset with a metal body and plastic highlights on the top and bottom. It measures 151.7 x 75 x 8mm and weighs 167 grams, and has a 1.6GHz octa-core Exynos 7870 system-on-chip consisting of eight ARM Cortex-A53 cores paired with the Mali-T830MP1 GPU. (Unfortunately, the device doesnât use the newer Exynos 7872 SoC , which is substantially faster.) In India, itâll come with 3GB/4GB of RAM and 32GB/64GB of storage. Thereâs a microSD card slot on both models that support up to 256GB expandable storage.. The Galaxy On7 Prime has a 5.5-inch Full HD (1920Ã1080) PLS TFT display with a 16:9 aspect ratio and 401 PPI. In terms of cameras, itâs got a 13MP rear camera with a f/1.9 aperture and a 13MP front camera that uses the same sensor as the rear camera but without autofocus.. The Galaxy On7 Prime has a 3,300mAh battery, and ships with Samsung Experience 8.5 on top of Android 7.1.1 Nougat. It has the standard array of connectivity options, including 4G VoLTE, Bluetooth 4.1, a microUSB port, Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. And thereâs a fingerprint sensor on the front integrated into the home button. (Itâs disappointing to note the absence of USB Type-C and Wi-Fi 802.11ac.). In India, the Galaxy On7 Prime will be available in Gold and Black colors. 12,990 ($203) for the 3GB RAM/32GB storage variant, and Rs. 14,990 ($235) for the 4GB RAM/64GB storage variant. Both will be available exclusively from Amazon India and the Samsung Shop, and go on sale from January 20. Launch offers include 10 percent cash back on HDFC Bank debit and credit cards and EMI, Rs. 2,000 ($31) cashback for JioMoney users, and an Amazon Pay value offer.. Our view : With the exception of the front camera, the specifications of the Galaxy On7 Prime are quite similar to the Galaxy J7 Prime, which was launched back in September 2016. The Galaxy On7 Prime has a 13MP front camera while the J7 Prime has an 8MP front camera. The On7 Prime has newer software, includes Samsung Mall, and has a new icon for the recent apps button, but everything else is pretty much the same as the J7 Prime, including the dimensions.. The Galaxy On7 Prime is an online exclusive, whereas the J7 Prime was available in offline retail. However, it seems a bit disingenuous of Samsung to call it an entirely new smartphone. For the most part, itâs the Galaxy J7 Prime with a new front camera and upgraded software. It canât compete on the basis of specifications with devices from the likes of Xiaomi, Honor, and Motorola. Performance-wise, the Galaxy On7 Prime is inferior when compared to its rivals, as other phones have moved to faster system-on-chips.. For devoted Samsung fans, the Galaxy On7 Prime might seem appealing. But one thingâs certain: Samsung still has a way. to go before it catches up with the likes of China-based brands in the budget phone market.. Want more posts like this delivered to your inbox?

Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime review: Old wine in a new bottle Robin Sinha | Gadgets Now | Updated: Feb 14, 2018, 12.02PM IST. Samsung has been quietly eating the pie with its Galaxy On and J series smartphones. This time, the ânewâ Galaxy On7 Prime is supposed to be the torch bearer of the series and thereâs a lot to be said about this one.. - Low-light photography works well - Samsung Mall app does a decent job - Impressive battery performance. NEW DELHI: At a time when the smartphone market is filled to the brim in all the possible segments, itâs perhaps a pertinent question to ask: does any launch make a real difference? Things get worse when you enter the sub-Rs 20,000 price segment. There are brands like Motorola and Honor that are going all guns blazing against each other to catch the fancy of the customers. Samsung , on the other hand, has been quietly eating the pie with its Galaxy On and J series smartphones. This time, the ânewâ Galaxy On7 Prime is supposed to be the torch bearer of the series and thereâs a lot to be said about this one.. For the uninitiated, the Galaxy On7 Prime reached the Indian shelves few days after the Galaxy A8+ last month. This Flipkart-exclusive smartphone will set you back by Rs 12,990. While this is for the 3GB RAM variant, the 4GB RAM model will cost you Rs 14,990.. However, soon after its launch, curious minds on the web found it to be exactly similar, in both design and specifications, to that of the Galaxy J7 Prime, which came out in 2016.. If you ask us, this is not a bad move if you want to sell the remaining stock and generate easy revenue but it does prove to be a deal breaker for many. The only possible reason we can think for Samsung to launch the J7 Prime as On7 Prime is to bring Samsung Pay Mini to even more customers easily and debut its Samsung Mall app, all without working on a completely new device, saving the effort and time.. Whatever might be the case, we have reviewed the device on how it performed while it was with us and have not made the âGalaxy J7 Primeâ factor affect it in any way. We have been testing the smartphone since past one week and have found it to be a mixed experience most of the times. Being a budget offering, it didnât come as a surprise that the Galaxy On7 Prime is your typical âbudgetâ Samsung device, a trait that we certainly havenât come to appreciate as appearances still matter. Back in 2016, this appearance perhaps would have been appreciated by most but not in the current climate. The moment you compare the device with the likes of Honor or Nokia, you immediately notice how quickly the On7 Prime loses its shine. We got the Gold colour variant that has a dark, earthy coloured front panel, giving it a slightly different spin to an otherwise stereotypical look.. You get the same fingerprint-laden physical button below the screen, accompanied by two non-backlit capacitive buttons. Volume controllers are on the left side, while the power button stays on the right. The 3.5mm headphone slot and micro-USB charging slot are at the bottom.. What users may find unusual is that the Galaxy On7 Prime has its speaker at the top right side. We do appreciate Samsung for this because with a side speaker, no matter if you hold the handset in portrait or landscape mode, the audio is not blocked.. What, however, didn't evoke a positive reaction from us was the placement of the volume buttons. For right hand users it takes a good stretch to reach them. For left hand users, it is still easy but then reaching for the power button requires them to adjust the grip.. Nonetheless, it does feel sturdy given its metal build and may resist a couple of drops from a couple of feet. Of course, it falling faced towards the ground may not save the display.. Talking about the display, as the general consensus on the Web and our past experience suggest, Samsung can't go wrong with its AMOLED display. But what if the handset doesnât come with an AMOLED panel at first place?. The smartphoneâs TFT LCD screen is certainly not the best, but still something on which we canât argue upon given the price bracket in which it falls. The device sports a 5.5-inch TFT LCD screen packing 720x1280 pixels in a non-fancy 16:9 aspect ratio. This doesn't sound convincing as you always have the option to chip in a bit more and get an 18:9 aspect ratio display-featuring smartphone. But it still is not as bad as it may seem to many and can be a device on which you can watch your daily Netflix shows without cribbing much.. Since itâs classified as a âbudgetâ smartphone, Samsung has clearly cut corners in its Galaxy On7 Prime. One of them is the auto brightness functionality, a basic feature that you can find in its competitors. But then that is compensated with other usual âSamsungâ features such as an âOutdoor Modeâ that throws extra brightness to the screen for easy viewing in bright daylight. It also has other usual set of customisations that many, especially those coming from Android One or Android Go smartphones, may find useful.. Auto brightness (ambient light sensor) is just one, Samsung has also been stingy by not including the compass and gyroscope.. While the design and the display together was a mix of positive and negative wavelength, performance is one section where our Galaxy On7 Prime unit was able to impress us the most. Before we tell you what processor and RAM combination the handset boasts of, we would like to tell you that it was used as a daily driver for over a week with over 90 apps installed. At no point did our unit face a single instance of stutter. Jumping from the app listing to heaviest of the games and photo-editing apps was nothing less than a breeze.. However, launching heavy applications such as Mortal Kombat will make you wait for a couple of minutes, which can be annoying at times.. Powering the Galaxy On7 Prime is a two-year old octa-core Samsung Exynos 7870 processor. Although the Exynos 7870 is not new in the chip market, it still managed to perform better than what we expected. While the majority of the credit goes to the processor, a part of it also goes to the on-board 4GB RAM. Mali-T830 takes care of all the graphics and animations you see on the screen.. Running the smartphone through GeekBench and AnTuTu gave us 62732 score and 723 (single core)/3552 (dual core) results, which are in no way impressive. Although these numbers don't really matter to majority of the users, they do to some nitpicks.. For those joining the Samsung smartphone family for the first time, Android 7.1.1 Nougat-based Galaxy On 7 Prime is fairly easy to get hold of. It runs Samsung Experience version 8.5, which is straightforward and gives you easy access to everything that you want. Thereâs also space for Bixby Home cards, edge-of-screen alerts, if you are into all of that. The Bixby Screen can be accessed by swiping right from the home screen. For everything else you get Google Assistant, which shows when you long-press the home button.. Also, donât expect Android 8.0 Oreo update for this device.. Since weâre talking about the software side of things, it is important to mention the Samsung Mall app that makes a debut with the Galaxy On7 Prime. The firm is heavily marketing the smartphone just because it has this particular app.. So what is Samsung Mall app?. It is a pre-installed app that simply lets you scan a product from the deviceâs camera. It scans and shows you similar products on its store from where you can buy them. In our tests it was more of a hit and miss. It does work in low light situations but you would need to turn on the handsetâs flashlight.. It is not necessary to click a product in order to buy. You can just browse through the categories, pay online and get it delivered to your home. To make this platform work, Samsung has joined hands with some of the major e-commerce giants including Amazon, Shopclues, Tata CLiQ and Jabong. The list will likely get bigger in future.. Since the company shows results from these e-commerce portals, choosing the product directs you to that e-commerce firmâs product webpage from where you can checkout. This way none of your payment details are stored with Samsung. In addition, if you have chosen three products from the Samsung Mall app from three different e-commerce companies, you would have to check out separately for each of them.. While this is the highlight on the software front, another feature worth mentioning here is the Samsung Pay Mini. This feature is not new and is already there in some of the budget Samsung handsets. The app lets you pay easily, cutting all the time you waste on taking out your plastic money and doing a transaction. The transactions with Samsung Pay Mini take place through UPI or e-wallets, specifically Paytm or MobiKwik.. The unit we received was the 64GB one but then as is the case with every smartphone, you donât get all of it for your use. We received around 41GB for app and content storage, while the rest was reserved for the OS and other preloaded files. In case you are one of those who likes to download movies and other heavy media content, you can expand the storage space of the device using a microSD card (up to 256GB).. Like the design, display and the processor, camera too is one of the make or break factors in a handset. In Galaxy On7 Prime, it is slightly above average. The 13MP rear camera is not the best in the class but is good enough to post them on social media. The daylight shots are nothing extraordinary but the low light shots were still better than expectations. This is mostly because of the f1.9 aperture that lets in more light, giving out images that are bright and show better colours than other usual camera sensors.. If youâve used a Samsung device earlier, then the camera interface would be familiar. You get quick buttons on the screen to access the settings, flash, expanded screen mode and switch to front-facing camera on one side. On the other end you get options to open Samsung Mall, add stickers and use the Instant Share feature. This is in addition to the shutter button, video recording button and image preview option. Youâll find the camera snappy enough and the interface light and easy to understand.. The camera performance is average when it comes to video recording. You can see the jerks and shakes in a video with handheld recording. Zooming and taking stills while recording a video is possible and so is adjusting the brightness. Manual adjustment of brightness is possible in addition to the auto brightness adjustment, which is activated by default. The results are decent though but nothing more than that.. For selfie lovers, the front-facing 13MP shooter does a good job. You get all the usual options to make your skin smoother, change the colour intensity, make your cheeks look thinner than usual and even make your eyes slightly bigger. The resulting images are bright and sharp, whether taken in low light or broad daylight. Both the front and rear cameras can shoot videos in up to full-HD resolution.. What probably is the strongest suit of the Galaxy On7 Prime is its battery. The smartphone has a 3300mAh battery, which can run for a complete day without asking to get charged. In our day-to-day use we observed the battery to give 6 hours or more on-screen time on an average, which is impressive as compared to what we have usually observed in Samsungâs Galaxy On series. Heavy usage of the smartphone will still make it run for around 8-10 hours.. But this is not all, Samsung generally gives you several other options to save battery. That comes as the âPower Savingâ mode. There are two power saving modes - Mid and Max, which deactivate animations, apps and some other functions to extend the life of the device.. We are not saying that the Galaxy On7 Prime is the best smartphone you can get in the given price bracket right now. However, we are also not giving it complete thumbs down as it performed well enough in some of the areas. For a daily user who does a little bit of everything on the device including gaming, watching movies, listening music, posting images on social media and more, this device works. But for those who want a device specifically for editing content or playing heavy games, this is not the best option.. Although the design is outright boring and the display doesnât have the âwowâ factor in it, the low light photography and battery performance are what is worth the appreciation. You also get features like Samsung Pay Mini and Samsung Mall, which is not yet there in any other handset..

CNET tambiÃ©n estÃ¡ disponible en espaÃ±ol.. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 review:. Steer clear of the Galaxy Note 7. The Good The Galaxy Note 7 is a beautiful, capable Android phone that showcases Samsung's best in design, battery life, speed and features. The 64GB base model leaves you plenty of space for photos, videos and games.. The Bad We just can't trust the hardware, given the ongoing reports of battery fires.. The Bottom Line Don't buy the Galaxy Note 7, and return it if you've already bought it.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Note 7 alternatives you should consider Note 7 return FAQ Why did Note 7 batteries burn? How to tell if you have a new and improved Note 7. Here's how the Note 7 compares with the S7 Edge, Motorola Moto Z, iPhone 6S and OnePlus 3 Samsung Galaxy Note 7 pricing and availability. Using the new S Pen stylus: It's smooth, precise, tricked-out. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is dead. After some handsets from both the initial run and from a second run of replacement phones caught fire, Samsung yanked it entirely. Samsung stopped making it , you can't buy it from legitimate sellers and, depending on where you live, your carrier may even send angel of death software to brick existing Note 7 phones to keep you from using it. (In the US, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint will send out this software. Samsung says that 93 percent of its US customers have now returned the potentially faulty device, which is also banned from all airplanes in this country and many others. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has gone further, saying, "Consumers should power down and stop using all Galaxy Note 7s.". You shouldn't buy a Galaxy Note 7, even if you can still find one. And if you still own one, you should immediately turn it off and exchange it for a different, non-Note 7 phone. Around the world, carriers and retailers will exchange your Note 7 for phones of equal value on the same network.. Here's everything you need to know about the disastrous Note 7 debacle. And here are phones we suggest you get instead: 9 Note 7 alternatives .. Earlier versions of this review follow.. When we first reviewed the Galaxy Note 7 in August, we found it to be one of the best phones of the year. A big beautiful AMOLED screen, excellent camera, some truly useful S-Pen tools and a big battery that lasted for hours.. And then a few dozen of those batteries burst into flames .. The new Note 7 has a green battery icon.. Since then, Samsung has initiated one of the biggest recalls in consumer electronics history, and recalled more than 2.5 million Note 7 phones globally. And now, the company has a replacement batch ready: more than half a million new Note 7s , with batteries that Samsung says don't have the defect that caused the fires in the first round.. So: if you want a big-screen Android phone, the corrected Note 7 is the way to go, right?. Samsung needs to rebuild trust here, and we're not ready to just endorse the corrected phone and call it a day. To that end, we're waiting at least until the end of October to see if any further reports of Note 7 issues crop up. (We're also testing corrected Note 7 phones in the wild, but just because we don't see a problem with our new review samples doesn't mean that there aren't any outstanding issues. After all, the original battery issue appeared in only a small fraction of the phones shipped from the original batch.). In the meantime, we're keeping this updated review here -- unrated -- while we continue to seek out real-world feedback on users' experience with the corrected version of the Note 7.. The 5.7-inch, stylus-slinging Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is a damn fine phone. Its sexy wraparound glass, precise S Pen and brilliant screen would impress anyone, but it's ideal for artists, architects and people who would rather write by hand than type on a screen.. It has a gorgeous, symmetrical design that looks particularly stunning in Coral Blue. It takes great photos and has both the water resistance and expandable memory slot that last year's Galaxy Note 5 lacked (oh yeah, there is no Note 6). Battery life goes on and on -- but not as long as for the Galaxy S7 Edge -- and you can charge up wirelessly.. This is Samsung's ultimate phone, with all the Edge's curved-screen goodies and more: 64GB of storage instead of the Edge's 32GB. An iris scanner for unlocking the phone with your eyes. A good, refreshed take on Android. A USB-C charger port that also charges up your other devices (you should buy a USB 3.1 cable for faster data speeds). New pen tricks to magnify, translate languages and make an animated GIF. A nighttime filter you can schedule to automatically give your weary, screen-staring eyes a break.. Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 looks awesome in 'Coral Blue'. The question you have to ask yourself is how much all this is worth to you. Because the Note 7 is one of the most expensive phones you can buy. It's comparable to Apple's large-screen iPhone 6S Plus (the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are right around the corner ), but costs more than the already pricey Edge, and it's twice the price of the OnePlus 3 , a CNET Editors' Choice winner for its excellence as an all-round midprice phone. In the US, promotions that bundle a free memory card or Samsung wearable help soothe the sting.. There's also some question about the Note 7's fragility. Although it survived all but the meanest splats in our dedicated drop test , the screen of my review unit mysteriously cracked in my purse. And reports of manufacturing mayhem that's reportedly caused some units to explode en route to customers are putting the brakes on shipments for now. For the record, none of our three review units has exploded or experienced similar trauma.. The Note 7 lets you leave your laptop behind more often.. As much as I loved my time with the compelling, beautiful, functional Note 7 -- and I really did -- I hesitate to recommend it to anyone who isn't serious about using that digital S Pen to draw, write and navigate on the phone. The S Pen has some minor issues, too. Sometimes wielding the stylus feels natural; other times tapping and typing make more sense. (Though it does make really great annotated photos, Snapchat snaps and social-media GIFs.). At the end of the day, most people can easily live without the Note 7, especially with the capable S7 Edge a near doppelganger. If you're ready to move on from the Note 4 , switching to the Note 7 gets you more storage and power, an upgradable Android version and a far better S Pen. If you're happy with the Note 5, wait a year. If not, with the Note 7 you get waterproofing, expandable storage and software shortcuts on those curved edges. With its elevated features and fee, the Note 7 is for buyers who delight in rarified details. Buy it and you get an excellent phone -- but if you aren't going to use that pen, forget it.. *Provisional, based on one prominent retailer.. Without the S Pen, the Note 7 is just a refined S7 Edge with steeper curved sides. This year's digital stylus has a fine, precise point and senses 4,096 levels of pressure, double last year's model. I wrote countless notes and a haiku, doodled all over, even handed the phone to CNET's art director for his professional assessment. But, compared with a 10-inch tablet, the screen is a small for creating fine art, though it handles notes and more casual drawings very well.. You can sketch some really cool things with the Note 7. CNET's art director, Marc Mendell, put my doodles to shame.. A few things bothered me about execution. Including the Note Edge , this is the seventh Note phone ever made, so all S Pen maneuvers should be flawless by now. But I still found it hard to paint an entire canvas without onscreen buttons getting in the way (they'll move if you get it right). It's easy to accidentally exit or press unintended controls that mysteriously shift the layout into something you don't want. That's frustrating, especially when you can't figure out how to resume the original canvas.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsungâs king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News.
