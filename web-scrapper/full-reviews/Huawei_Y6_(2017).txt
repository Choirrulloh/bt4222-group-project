The Huawei Y6 (2017) is a 5-inch smartphone, which belongs to the upper price range of entry-level devices with an RRP of just under 160 Euros (~$135). The Chinese manufacturer wants to attract prospective buyers with a large battery for this category, decent performance and a freely configurable button. This sounds like a good offer, but the.

The gray model features a black front side; the others match colors front and back. The case is quite stable; it hardly twists or creaks. Only high pressure causes ripples on the liquid crystal display.. The size is on par with similarly expensive smartphones with the same display size. The case is several tenths of a millimeter higher than other devices', which might be caused by the high-capacity battery. The Y6 also weighs a few grams more. But, both differences are that small that they are acceptable in favor of a longer battery life. Thanks to curved edges, the smartphone sits comfortably in the hand.. The removable rear cover allows replacing SIM cards and microSD card, but the battery cannot be removed (that easily).. Huawei Y6 (2017) full resolution. Huawei Y6 (2017) full resolution.

The RAM capacity is sufficient for everyday tasks, but you should not work with too many apps, which are left open in the background. 10.6 GB of the storage space are free for your data and apps in delivery state. That is okay, but those who like to run games or install other large apps will run out of storage soon. In return, you can add up to 128 GB storage with a microSD card. There is a dedicated microSD slot. Hence, you do not have to give up one of the dual SIM slots. Apps can be installed on the memory card if the app allows you to do so.. The Huawei Y6 (2017) is based on Android 6.0. At the time of the test, the security patches were already outdated and an update was not available. It is not to be expected that an update will be rolled out since not much effort is put into cheap devices. Huawei's EMUI over Android changes the appearance and adds features, but those familiar with Android will quickly get along with it.. You have to accept several advertising apps and preinstalled Free2Play games, but there are not too many. In addition, Huawei installs many more or less useful tools, which you can uninstall if you do not like them. One of them simulates a mirror by means of the front camera and another one a torch. Many UI designs are available, but only one is preinstalled at the beginning. The phone manager helps to keep memory consumption low and keep an eye on power consumption. The settings are slightly pooled and advanced settings are hidden in a sub function. The notification center has also been slightly redesigned.. Wi-Fi standards 802.11 b/g/n are usual in this price class and the Huawei Y6 (2017) provides it. Hence, it cannot access the less used 5 GHz band, but ensures fairly fast internet connections. Nevertheless, it does not exploit modern DSL rates: In our standardized Wi-Fi test, the smartphone remains under 50 MBit/s in sending and receiving and is the slowest model in our comparison group. In our real-world test, we check opening times of various web sites close to the router. While full reception is available in this scenario, loading images still takes a long time. We still had the full signal and high transmission rates at a distance of ten meters (~33 ft) to the router and through three walls in the home wireless network. Loading took similarly long as close to the router.. Huawei is a bit stingy in cellular networks with only five LTE bands. It covers all networks important for middle Europe however. Other smartphones offer more LTE bands, for example, the. has as much as nine LTE bands available. 4 is the standard in this class, which is met by the Huawei Y6. The reception is decent: In the well-developed German D2 network, we had at least half the reception in the city, even in buildings..

The GPS module of the Huawei Y6 (2017) is not able to geolocate indoors. Outdoors, geolocation takes some time, the accuracy increases slowly and finally reaches a good value of 4 meters (~13 ft).. For more real-world relevance of our tests, we took the Huawei Y6 and the Garmin Edge 500, a professional navigation device, on a bike tour. The course is about 200 meters (~656 ft) shorter than what the reference navigation device reports when measured by the Y6. This difference is just acceptable for a course of about 6.5 km (~4 miles). The Y6 sometimes lost contact to the satellites for a long time and drew straight lines between remote measuring points. This can be seen in the Runtastic app, which we use to evaluate the data. Nevertheless, the Huawei Y6 is able to track the course sufficiently accurately most of the time. Hence, you can easily use the smartphone as a free time navigation device.. GPS Garmin Edge 500 â total. GPS Garmin Edge 500 â crossroads. GPS Garmin Edge 500 â wood. Huawei changed the telephone app, but stuck to the basic concept of the Google's standard app: A number field and a call list are displayed first. You can directly access contacts and favorites via tabs on the top. Spam filter and call rejection via SMS are available, too. Overall, the app is well arranged and it is logical how to use it.. The call quality is decent: The conversation partner sounds clear, but not especially loud, while our own voices sounded loud to the conversation partner; even when we spoke softly. Those with loud voices might face problems since the microphone is quickly overdriven. Those who want to use hands-free equipment, have to get along with the squawking speaker, which distorts the voice of the conversation partner and generates disturbing noise. Our voice is transmitted with significant noise and sounds strangely distant.. 13 MP rear camera and 5 MP front camera: This is how typical mid-range phones are equipped nowadays. The Huawei Y6 (2017) also uses this combination. As small advantage compared to other models, the rear camera features a dual LED flash, which ensures the right flash color in different scenarios. The front camera also features an LED flash.. The 5 MP front camera shoots quite sharp images with decent colors in good distance. Moreover, the dynamic is decent in dark parts, while bright parts are slightly overexposed.. The main camera on the rear side shoots images with quite cool colors. Details and larger color fields appear pixelated at a closer look. Bright parts get quickly overexposed and the dynamic is not ideal in dark parts. The video quality is 1080p at 30 fps. Colors appear decent in videos, details are quite sharp. The exposure also adjusts quite quickly to the situation. However, you sometimes have to correct the autofocus, since it does not always select the correct sharpness. You can use several filters during recording of photos and videos. Moreover, the software includes a beautification mode, which lets skin blemishes disappear. The fast-motion mode records a video, which is simply played faster. You do not have any options here. The image suddenly blurred during our test and we could not correct the focus.. The camera is okay for occasional use. Those who expect more than snapshots from a smartphone camera can also find a suitable model in this price class: The. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. The main camera gets another chance: We shot images of our reference card under fixed lighting conditions in our lab. Hence, we cannot say much about the quality of details and text on colored background. We could detect inaccurate edges and stained color fields when we checked the colors. Colors are slightly too pale in general.. ColorChecker: the target color is displayed in the lower half of each field.. Apart from a charging adapter and a USB cable, Huawei also includes an in-ear headset, which is sufficient for occasional telephone calls or as replacement headphones. Currently, Huawei does not offer specific accessories in its shop.. The warranty for the device is 12 months, 6 months for the battery, and 3 months for the headphones.. The virtual keyboard from Huawei stems from the manufacturer Nuance and is called Swype. It is also available for all other smartphones in the Google Play Store. The keys are quite small in portrait mode. In return, there are small gaps between the letters. Nevertheless, we found it more difficult to hit the right keys than with Google's standard keyboard. It is easy to change the keyboard app or download a new app from the Play Store and install it.. There is a freely configurable button, the so-called Easy Key, on the left side of the Huawei Y6 (2017)'s case. Upon first press, the related app is opened, and you can assign actions or apps to short, long, or double press. This is easy and the number of options is exemplary.. The menu buttons of Android are only displayed on the screen. Thanks to the comfortable touchscreen surface, which is also very sensitive at the edges, they are easy to use.. The 5-inch display offers the usual resolution for this price class with 1280x720 pixels. It is not particularly bright with an average of 432.1 cd/mÂ² however. Several models in our comparison group including the Xperia E5 and Galaxy J3 have significantly brighter displays. The brightness distribution is quite even with 90%. As a result, even larger color fields look evenly lit.. 412 cd/m² 433 cd/m² 447 cd/m² 411 cd/m² 438 cd/m² 435 cd/m² 417 cd/m² 438 cd/m² 458 cd/m². 90 % Center on Battery: 438. cd/m²) ΔE Color 4.8 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 3.2 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 95.3% sRGB (Calman) Gamma: 2.23.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 8995 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. Although the brightness of the display is relatively low, the Huawei Y6 (2017) achieves a great contrast of 3369:1. Hence, the black value has to be very good, since the contrast is calculated from black value and brightness. actually is a very good value for the brightness of black fields. Colors still do not appear vibrant.. The color temperature can be adjusted continuously, but you can also select one of three presets: standard, cold, and warm. We checked the color representation of all three settings with the CalMAN software and the spectrophotometer. The color shift compared to the reference color space is big; especially for blue colors. The average color shift of all colors is acceptable however. The mode "warm" delivers the best results. Hence, it can be suspected that the image is quite bluish with standard settings. This is actually very evident in the gray scales in standard and cold mode..

In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.9 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is worse than the average of all tested devices (42.2 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. The Huawei Y6 (2017) can be used outdoors and even the built-in brightness sensor works reliably there. However, the glossy display becomes a problem under direct sunlight. Hence, the smartphone is more suitable for use in the shade.. A small brightness loss is notable when inclining to top or bottom. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

Huawei usually uses SoCs from its own manufacturer HiSilicon in its smartphones. However, the Chinese follow a different strategy here: A. It features four cores and clocks at up to 1.5 GHz. With it, the Huawei Y6 delivers slightly higher performance than usual in this class and can take the lead in almost all benchmarks. Depending on the competitor, the Huawei is up to 30% faster. You can notice this in everyday use since navigation through the operating system does not stutter and demanding apps run smoothly.. Our test model uses the same graphic solution as many models in the comparison group: The dual-core. with a clock rate of up to 650 MHz. The higher CPU performance also has an impact on the graphic benchmarks. The Huawei Y6 (2017) always comes out top here, too.. AnTuTu v6 - Total Score (sort by value) Huawei Y6 2017.

Access to our reference memory card, the Toshiba Exceria Pro M501, is quite slow. All other devices in our comparison group perform better here. Access to the internal storage device is fast and the Huawei Y6 ranks at the top here. It can certainly not keep up with UFS-2.1 storage in current high-end smartphones however. Nevertheless, apps and games are opened fairly fast..

Gaming is possible with the Huawei Y6 (2017), but you might need to reduce the detail settings in demanding games. For example, Asphalt 8 cannot maintain 24 fps set to high details. However, it achieves a playable 30 fps at low details. The zombie shooter Trigger 2 is slightly less demanding and also reaches playable frame rates. Simpler games such as Clash of Clans or Angry Birds run without problems.. Control via touchscreen and position sensor works smoothly.. in comparison Samsung Galaxy J1 2016 (min). 7570 Quad, Mali-T720 MP2 Honor 6A. 430, Adreno 505 Huawei Y6 2017.

In idle mode, the temperature does not exceed 33.5 Â°C (~92 Â°F). The device can be carried in trousers pockets without problems.. Nevertheless, the SoC can keep up its full performance under load and does not throttle. We determined this with the Manhattan battery test in the GFXBench, which renders the same sequence 30 times in a loop and records the calculated frames for each run. Since the results of the runs at the beginning and the end do not differ much, throttling is not to be expected.. 34.3 °C 33.3 °C 33.9 °C. 35.3 °C 33.8 °C 36.3 °C. 36.2 °C 34 °C 35.5 °C.

It is good that manufacturers almost always place the speaker on the bottom edge, since it cannot be dampened so easily by, for example, placing it on a soft surface or holding the smartphone in the hand. The small mono speaker of the Huawei Y6 (2017) is quite loud with 83.4 dB(A), has audible lower mid-tones but no bass. The high-tones are slightly sharp, especially at high volume. They are actually very pronounced in our measurement diagram. The speaker can be used for occasional YouTube videos or short music pieces, but more demanding people should connect speakers or headphones. This can be done via Bluetooth or 3.5 mm audio jack. Both options work fast and deliver clear sound.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 29.6 29.9 29.6 25 27.9 28.9 27.9 31 28.8 30 28.8 40 36.6 47.8 36.6 50 30.5 34.2 30.5 63 25.7 26.3 25.7 80 24.5 28.5 24.5 100 28.1 31.7 28.1 125 38.5 36.2 38.5 160 30.4 23.4 30.4 200 36.1 21.7 36.1 250 40 20.7 40 315 43.9 19.6 43.9 400 47.5 21 47.5 500 53.8 20.2 53.8 630 59.8 18.7 59.8 800 64.7 18.8 64.7 1000 65.7 17.6 65.7 1250 67.1 17.6 67.1 1600 69.5 16.8 69.5 2000 70.1 16.3 70.1 2500 72.8 16.4 72.8 3150 73.9 16.1 73.9 4000 75.9 16.2 75.9 5000 73.8 16 73.8 6300 70.3 15.9 70.3 8000 70.2 16.1 70.2 10000 73.6 16 73.6 12500 68.8 15.8 68.8 16000 53.8 15.9 53.8 SPL 83.4 29.9 83.4 N 52.1 1.4 52.1 median 65.7 Huawei Y6 2017 median 17.6 median 65.7 Delta 11.5 2.7 11.5 28.2 31.1 28.2 30.3 30.1 30.3 29.3 29.9 29.3 33.6 34.4 33.6 28 34.6 28 27.2 29.3 27.2 29.2 32.2 29.2 31.9 34.1 31.9 39.8 36.9 39.8 36.4 23.8 36.4 48.4 21.5 48.4 51.7 20.9 51.7 57.1 21.3 57.1 59.8 19.7 59.8 65.8 20.1 65.8 67.6 18.5 67.6 67.7 19.3 67.7 69.5 17.8 69.5 67.8 17.4 67.8 67.5 16.4 67.5 67.6 16.4 67.6 67.9 16.6 67.9 71 16.1 71 74.7 16.1 74.7 71 16.1 71 61 16 61 58.7 16.1 58.7 58.9 16.1 58.9 51.3 16 51.3 39.8 16 39.8 80.9 30.1 80.9 47.9 1.4 47.9 median 61 Samsung Galaxy J3 2017 median 17.4 median 61 8.7 3.7 8.7 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Frequency diagram in comparison (checkboxes can be checked or unchecked!). Unfortunately, our measurement instrument does not deliver useful data about Huawei Y6 (2017)'s power consumption.. The Huawei Y6 (2017)'s battery proves to have high stamina. This is not surprising since the battery has a very high capacity for a 5-inch device in its price class with 3000 mAh (11.4 Wh). Wi-Fi Surfing is possible for almost 11 hours and the device lasts above 5 hours under full load. The smartphone can even last two workdays if it is not continuously used. However, our test model cannot keep up with the excellent energy management of the Samsung Galaxy J3 : Samsung manages even longer battery runtimes with a much smaller battery.. 2:30 hours are required for recharging via the included power adapter. Unfortunately, fast charging is not supported.. Idle (without WLAN, min brightness) 25h. NBC WiFi Websurfing Battery Test 1.3 10h.

Test model provided by Huawei Germany.. Huawei has recently announced that they. no longer want to produce entry-level smartphones. This is understandable, yet a bit sad in view of the well-made Huawei Y6 (2017). The device offers more performance than usual in its price class and a big battery, which makes decent battery runtimes possible. Unfortunately, the battery can no longer be replaced, which is a trend in current devices.. The device is well equipped with microSD slot and dual SIM support. The case is hardly heavier and bigger than comparable devices despite the bigger battery. Design-wise, the Y6 is nothing special, but build quality and stability of the chassis are decent.. Complaints are the slow Wi-Fi and the few LTE bands, the squawking hands-free equipment via speaker and the overly sensitive microphone. The camera quality is rather modest and the display is slightly darker than many competitors'.. The Huawei Y6 (2017) combines great system performance and long battery life. The camera is the weakness of the device, which offers a good price performance ratio otherwise.. To summarize, the Huawei Y6 (2017) is a recommendation for all who want high performance and good battery runtimes for little money, but do not consider the image quality of the camera too important..

Huawei Y6 2017 Reviews - page 2. Huawei Y6 2017 is rated. Rated 5 out of. I bought this phone about a week ago & so far so very good. It does everything I want it to including displaying text messages & missed phone calls on the front screen which I really need it to. Battery life seems good so far but it's the little touches like the superb screen (HD), button response, clear voice calls & quite good photos too that make it a winner. Functionality is good & it recognised & read my SDHC card straight away. I would buy (& did) a protective silicon cover for outright case protection but overall I can't fault it for the money. Uses a Nano SIM so please check before buying although good providers like Vodafone will sort one out very quickly from their shops. Good signal with Vodafone & good service from Carphone Warehouse.. Rated 5 out of. Best phone I have ever had!. My mum bought this phone for me after having a Sony Xperia Z1 Compact and this is certainly a very good phone. Only slight problem is that my front camera had been a bit pixelated but that's what a warranty is for, so I will be sending it back for free using my 2 year warranty. I think Huawei is a very good and reliable company unlike some. I would also like to say that the battery life on this phone is amazing I honestly go on my phone for hours everyday and I get normally 10 to 40% left over, depending on how much I use it. Camera when fixed should be good, according too other reviews but meanwhile the back camera is fab with 13MP. And don't forget, the screen quality is fab. I would 100% buy this product! :-). Rated 5 out of. I have been using the Y6 2017 for over one week now. I brought it replace my Huawei Y3 which didn't have much processing power and memory. I wanted a 4" screen like the Y3 for comfort in my trouser pocket but all smaller screens seem to have small memory. What a revelation this phone is. I'm not one for films/games so I can't comment on that aspect. My use is as a phone, general internet surfing and sending photos via Whatsapp to friends and family. Battery life is two days at a stretch but I charge it daily to make sure it doesn't run out on the second day. When are manufactures going to produce decent batteries? I have seen some of the negative comments for this phone but they don't apply to my experience. For me it's incredible value for the £100 I paid at Carphone Warehouse.. Rated 5 out of. i have had the Huawie Y6 for 2 weeks now & wow what a phone. The 5 inch Screen is nice & bright, The dual flash on the back is a Brilliant idea & as for the camera its self,it is Fantastic for taking Great photos. i have had lots of phones in my time but this is simply the brst phone i have ever had.

Huawei Y6 Pro 2017 Smartphone Review. Marcus Herbrich ( translated by Martin Jungowski), 11/14/2017. Touchscreen Smartphone Android. Huawei's Y6 Pro (2017) is the manufacturer's latest Y-series model. We liked the entry-level smartphone's fancy metal case, its very decent hardware, and its compact size. Unfortunately, we also found one particular issue with lots and lots of room for improvement..

Best Notebooks for University Students Â». Top Windows alternatives to Apple's MacBook series Â». Â» Tablets , Â» Windows Tablets Â» Smartphones. For the original German article, see here .. With the Y6 Pro, Chinese manufacturer Huawei is expanding its affordable Y-series. Unlike its non-Pro namesake , the Huawei Y6 Pro (2017) is powered by a. Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 and an Adreno GPU. In addition, its case is made mostly of metal instead of plastic, and it includes a fingerprint-reader to boot. Similarities between the two phones include the 5-inch display and the remaining technical specifications.. Equipped with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of expandable storage (Micro SD cards up to 128 GB are supported), the Huawei Y6 Pro (2017) also includes a 13 MP main rear-facing camera with PDAF autofocus and a 5 MP selfie-camera at the front.. Selling for around $200, Huawei has positioned this entry-level device in a highly competitive market segment. Accordingly, plenty of competitors are up in arms to defend their turf, among others the Lenovo Moto E4 Plus ,. Samsung Galaxy J3 2017 , and in-house rivals. Y6 2017 , and Honor 6A ..

Made mostly of metal, the Huawei Y6 Proâs case is available in black, silver, or gold, and at only 144 x 71 mm the phone is surprisingly compact. Nevertheless, the phoneâs bezels seem comparatively large, and its display-to-body ratio is only 67.5%. At only 145 g it is very pleasant to hold in the hand.. For an entry-level device, build quality and choice of material were better than expected. The two buttons on the right-hand side of the device - the power button and volume rocker - are a tight fit and easy to reach, and they offer comfortably firm feedback and actuation..

For its price-point, 16 GB of eMMC storage is decently sized. Out of the box only 10.2 GB is available to the user, though. Storage can be expanded via Micro SD card (up to 128 GB); however, it cannot be formatted as internal storage.. The Huawei Y6 Pro (2017) is charged via the Micro USB 2.0 port at the bottom that does not support external peripherals such as keyboards or thumb drives via USB-OTG. Wireless display-streaming via Miracast worked flawlessly.. The preloaded Android 7.0 operating system comes with Huaweiâs in-house user interface EMUI 5.1 on top, and the deviceâs security patch level was up to date (September 2017). Whether or not Huawei is planning to update the phone to Android 8.0 Oreo has not yet been determined. Considering the smartphoneâs price-point it is highly unlikely though.. Compared to stock Android, Huaweiâs user interface has been heavily modified. In addition, several applications are preloaded on this device out of the box. With support for 802.11 b/g/n, the Huawei Y6 Proâs Wi-Fi module only supports the highly congested 2.4 GHz frequency bands. Range and reception were decent, and when standing right next to the Wi-Fi router (Telekom Speedport W921V) power ratio was measured at around -41 dBm.. Overall Wi-Fi performance was at a level expected of a device at this price-point. Connected to our Linksys EA8500 reference router we were able to transfer a meager 52 Mbps (RX) and 47 Mbps (TX). Other devices in this price range offered comparable performance.. In addition to the aforementioned Wi-Fi standards, the device also supports Bluetooth 4.1 but lacks an NFC chip.. The phone utilizes the most commonly used 2G, 3G, and 4G bands including LTE Cat. 4 with up to 150 Mbps (downstream). It also has dual SIM capabilities support for up to two Nano-SIM cards simultaneously. However, only the main SIM slot supports all frequencies and bands; the secondary slot is limited to 2G networks..

Positioning is performed via GPS, BeiDou, or GLONASS. Outdoors, position lock is obtained fairly quickly and accurately (6 m). However, we were unable to connect to any satellites indoors.. GPS accuracy is measured by taking the smartphone on an 8 km-long bike trip and comparing the results to a professional Garmin Edge 500 GPS. With only 20 m difference between the two (based mainly on alleged shortcuts) the entry-level device performed very well overall.. Connected to Germanyâs Vodafone network, call quality was decent by and large. The integrated microphoneâs quality was very high, and we were easily understandable. Ambient noise was filtered fairly well.. The rear cameraâs 13 MP (4160x3120 pixels) CMOS sensor supported by a PDAF autofocus did its job very well, and the resulting photos were rich in detail. Dynamic range was somewhat limited though, and photos with a high dynamic range were often overexposed. While color accuracy was nowhere near the likes of. Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 , it was very decent considering the smartphoneâs price. As is not uncommon for entry-level devices, photos taken in low-light situations were quite blurry with a significant amount of noise.. The front-facing 5 MP (2592x1944) camera is decent enough for occasional snapshots. Its photos are visibly worse than the rear cameraâs and often both blurry and overexposed.. Both cameras are capable of recording FHD video at 30 FPS.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. In addition to the smartphone itself, the box contains a modular 5 W charger, a USB cable, a quick-start guide, and a warranty booklet.. Devices sold in the US are limited to seller warranty.. The controls are implemented via three capacitive on-screen buttons at the bottom of the screen. The 5-inch display reacted very accurately to touch input up to its very edges and corners. While input was accurate overall, it wasnât particularly quick or reactive: occasionally, the reaction to touch input lagged behind significantly.. The integrated fingerprint-reader on the smartphone's rear side was fairly fast, however it was nowhere near the more expensive Huawei smartphones. In addition, it takes quite a while for the display to awaken from standby. Once unlocked, the sensor can be used for ending phone calls or taking photos and videos.. The Y6 Proâs IPS panel features a resolution of 1280x720. Given its 5-inch diagonal, the resulting pixel density is 294 ppi, and thus fairly average for its price-point. Subjectively, the panel was decently sharp and crisp.. According to our measurements with the X-Rite i1Pro2, the displayâs maximum brightness was 407 nits and around 15 nits less with activated ambient light sensor. In the real-world APL50 test (Average Picture Level) the maximum brightness returned was 389 nits.. 396 cd/m² 386 cd/m² 366 cd/m² 407 cd/m² 393 cd/m² 373 cd/m² 407 cd/m² 390 cd/m² 370 cd/m². 90 % Center on Battery: 393. cd/m²) ΔE Color 5.8 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 3 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.31.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. Contrast ratio (936:1) and black level (0.42 nits) are comparable to its competitors. That said, the Y6 Proâs namesake without the âProâ suffix scored much better. The real-world APL50 test yielded very similar results (0.42 nits, 926:1).. The panelâs DeltaE deviations of 5.8 (colors) and 3 (gray scale) were satisfactory overall and were comparatively low for an entry-level device. A blue filter can be enabled by selecting the eye comfort mode, and it should help to reduce eye strain..

In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.8 (minimum) to 240 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is similar to the average of all tested devices (26.5 ms).

In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.9 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is similar to the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Brightness was high enough to overpower the sun even on sunny days. However, given its glossy and highly reflective nature, the display was completely unreadable when faced directly and had to be used at an angle. This worked perfectly fine thanks to its wide IPS viewing angles with only minor brightness decrease at extreme angles.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 is an entry-level ARM SoC first introduced in 2016. Manufactured in a 28 nm process, the 64-bit SoC incorporates four Cortex A53 cores with clock rates up to 1.4 GHz and an. In most benchmarks, the Y6 Pro performed fairly well and even better than its competitors. Our real-world experience differed immensely, though. In everyday use, the Snapdragon 425 combined with 2 GB of RAM stuttered and stalled quite frequently when multitasking. Thus, minor lags and longer loading times became an innate part of the Y6 Proâs user experience.. AnTuTu v6 - Total Score (sort by value) Huawei Y6 Pro 2017.

At least storage performance was not half bad for its price-point. While it was unable to keep up with its non-Pro namesake in the AndroBench 5 test in regard to internal storage, the integrated Micro SD card-reader was reasonably fast. Benchmarked with our usual Toshiba Exceria Pro M501 reference card (maximum read: 270 MB/s; maximum write: 150 MB/s), it yielded a read and write performance of 84 and 64 MB/s, respectively..

The deviceâs mono speaker is located behind the machined holes at the bottom of the device. Given its price-point, sound quality was adequate. As expected, mids and highs dominated the soundscape, and their characteristics were not particularly linear to boot. As can be seen on the pink noise diagram, lows (bass) were completely inaudible. At 85 dB(A), the speakerâs maximum volume was decent and sufficient.. The 3.5 mm headphone jack worked flawlessly and put out a very clear audio signal.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 35.2 43.9 25 32.9 44.5 31 37.2 37.9 40 31.7 38.3 50 39.6 42.1 63 28.3 34 80 27.3 33.5 100 26.9 31.5 125 26.7 32.6 160 24 30.6 200 20.9 34.7 250 20.9 36.6 315 19.5 40.8 400 18.5 46 500 17.5 55.4 630 17.5 60 800 15.7 68.3 1000 15.8 68.3 1250 16.6 70 1600 15.8 66 2000 15.4 68.5 2500 15.5 70.5 3150 16 72.5 4000 15.8 76.7 5000 16 80.5 6300 16.3 74.8 8000 16.3 70.9 10000 16.2 72.9 12500 16.4 69.2 16000 16.4 54.9 SPL 28.6 85.3 N 1.1 56.4 median 16.4 Huawei Y6 Pro 2017 median 68.3 Delta 2.1 13 29.6 29.9 29.6 27.9 28.9 27.9 28.8 30 28.8 36.6 47.8 36.6 30.5 34.2 30.5 25.7 26.3 25.7 24.5 28.5 24.5 28.1 31.7 28.1 38.5 36.2 38.5 30.4 23.4 30.4 36.1 21.7 36.1 40 20.7 40 43.9 19.6 43.9 47.5 21 47.5 53.8 20.2 53.8 59.8 18.7 59.8 64.7 18.8 64.7 65.7 17.6 65.7 67.1 17.6 67.1 69.5 16.8 69.5 70.1 16.3 70.1 72.8 16.4 72.8 73.9 16.1 73.9 75.9 16.2 75.9 73.8 16 73.8 70.3 15.9 70.3 70.2 16.1 70.2 73.6 16 73.6 68.8 15.8 68.8 53.8 15.9 53.8 83.4 29.9 83.4 52.1 1.4 52.1 median 65.7 Huawei Y6 2017 median 17.6 median 65.7 11.5 2.7 11.5 31.6 37.1 25.4 36.7 25.3 36.9 32.9 29.7 33.6 32.3 31.6 33.7 28.4 27.5 27 27 20.8 25.6 22 26.3 21.3 31.5 20.8 39.8 21.2 46 19.4 53 19.5 59.2 17.7 62.2 17.9 64.4 17.8 69 17.3 70.7 17.4 69.3 16.7 71.5 17.2 74 18.2 74.4 17.9 76.7 17.6 76.8 17.7 72 17.8 70.4 17.9 68.7 18.1 68 18.2 63.8 30 83.8 1.3 55.6 median 17.9 Honor 6A median 68 1.3 12.5 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

In review: Huawei Y6 Pro 2017. Review unit courtesy of Huawei Germany.. The Huawei Y6 Pro (2017) is a compact and good-looking upper entry-level smartphone that won't cost you an arm and a leg. For around $200 you get a nicely equipped device with 16 GB of storage space, 2 GB of RAM, and a well-made metal case. In addition, battery life is decent thanks to its large 3,020 mAh battery.. Unfortunately, Huawei has failed to address some of its non-Pro namesakeâs flaws and has carried them over to the Pro model as well. For example, Wi-Fi performance is still subpar and the selection of supported LTE bands is relatively low. The display is just as dark as it was, yet for some reason its contrast level and black point are even lower than on the Y6 (2017) ! Itâs a mystery to us what exactly qualified the new display to be used in a âProâ device.. The biggest issue we have had was the deviceâs poor and erratic system performance. Huaweiâs user interface EMUI 5.1 simply does not run smoothly on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 425, resulting in fairly regular stutter and lag.. Despite deficits regarding display and performance, the Huawei Y6 Pro (2017) is an overall decent package for around $200. Whether or not it is worth the price premium when compared to its non-Pro namesake is up to your individual liking.. Huawei Y6 Pro 2017 - 2017-11-06 11/06/2017 v6 Marcus Herbrich.

Affordable Huawei Y6 2017 goes official, still uses Android 6.0 Marshmallow. by Cosmin Vasile. Tags :. Android - Android + Huawei - Huawei +. Huawei has already introduced two new Y series smartphones this month, so it's no surprise the Chinese company silently launched a third one, the Y6 2017. As the name suggests, the Y6 2017 is the sequel to the Huawei Y6 , which was released on the market two years ago. Obviously, the new device comes with many improvements over the predecessor, so it's definitely worth upgrading if that's what you want to know. However, since the Huawei Y6 2017 remains an affordable smartphone, its specs aren't impressive at all. On top of that, the Chinese handset maker decided to include Android 6.0 Marshmallow on board, instead of going for a new version of the OS. Unsurprisingly, the Y6 2017 is equipped with a 1.4GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6737T processor, coupled with 2GB RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. The smartphone sports a 5-inch IPS display with HD (720p) resolution and a 3,000 mAh battery. On the back side, there's a 13-megapixel photo snapper, while on the front, Huawei added a secondary 5-megapixel camera for selfies and video calls. Aside from the rather large battery and the decent camera, another selling point of the Huawei Y6 2017 could be the fact that it features dual-SIM support. Huawei has yet to announce when the Y6 2017 will go on sale and how much it will cost, but we expect it to be priced at less than €200.. via Winfuture.de ( translated ).
