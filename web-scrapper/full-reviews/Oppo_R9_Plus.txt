Esto también se puede leer en español.. Big screen, big power, big battery. The Good For a moderate cost, the Oppo R9 Plus give a surprising high level of power and a battery level to match.. The Bad The design isn't going to win any awards for originality and it's not a pure Android experience.. The Bottom Line If you want a big screen phone that lasts and lasts, the Oppo R9 Plus has the right price.. It seems that these days one of the worst insults you can deliver to a phone is that it looks like an iPhone. My colleague Aloysius Low called out the smaller size Oppo R9 for this, as did Daniel Van Boom on the Meizu Pro 6 .. The Oppo R9 Plus keeps the Apple-esque trend going, but unlike my colleagues I actually think the phone looks great, even if the rose-gold shade isn't my favourite.. The R9 Plus has a 6-inch screen, compared to the 5.5-inch of the R9. The bigger screen has the same 1,920x1,080-pixel resolution, which means a slight reduction in pixels-per-inch from the R9 (367 vs 401), but you're not going to notice. The rear camera has been upped from 13-megapixels to 16-megapixels but, again, that's not going to change your world. (The front camera is the same 16-megapixels as the R9 -- it's a selfie-lover's dream.). What you will notice is the big in both battery and processing power that the R9 Plus offers over the R9. The Plus has the Snapdragon 652 CPU. It's a 1.8GHz octa-core chip, but what matters is that it has a big uptick in both general performance and graphics processing power over the basic R9 model. In fact, in our benchmark testing, it was up there with the Sony Xperia X and the Huawei Mate 8 .. Battery life is the other big bonus. With a 4,120mAh battery, I was expecting something good, but the R9 Plus exceeded my expectations with a test result of 17 hours and 30 minutes. That makes it one of the best batteries we've seen this year.. Take a look at the Oppo R9 Plus powerhouse. More importantly, all this is coming at just AU$100 more than the R9 -- AU$699. That's around $530 or £395, although we're still waiting for official pricing and availability outside of the Asia-Pacific region.. It may be an iPhone clone, but the Oppo R9 Plus packs enough power in to make it a worthwhile option for a mid-range Android phone. And unless you're absolutely against using a 6-inch screen, it's a better option than the R9 given its small additional cost.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News. Homeland Security's tall order: A hacker-free election. 'Annihilation' director wove memory into a dream-like movie. Dogecoin: The joke cryptocurrency that was too real for its own good.

Oppo R9 Plus Performance and Battery. When people think of top range phones, the likes of Samsung, HTC, LG and more recently (albeit with selected handsets) Huawei come to mind for most users. Oppo are working very hard to catch up to the front runners in the Android race; they’re extremely well recognised in China and they’re doing a great job at punching above their weight and are surely at the pointy end of the pack chasing down the top names. So when the chance to review the R9 plus came up following my hugely enjoyable experience with the R7s, I jumped at it.. The task of differentiating yourself above the others in the device pack following the major players is more difficult that it would appear on the surface. The device needs to offer a clean, good look while maintaining solid and reliable performance with a particular focus on battery life for a large percentage of users in the space. If that’s not enough, the price needs to be realistically about half that of the flagships sitting in the $600 to $700 range which still isn’t a cheap device, so have Oppo made the cost worth it?. When you’re sporting a 6-inch screen, it is rather difficult to be slender and lightweight. The R9 plus does absolutely nothing to dispel that stereotype, but if you’re buying a 6-inch screen you’re not in it for those traits. Where the bigger devices come into their own is the screen real estate you have, the functionality that that extra space offers and probably extra battery life that larger devices are able to (hopefully) offer by packing a larger battery into the chassis. Thats where the R9 Plus really delivers.. The phone measures 163.1mm x 80.8mm x (an impressive) 7.4mm; it’s only slightly larger than my Note 5 but gives an extra .3” of screen size for it all with only an extra 14 grams of weight. Physically the differences are quite subtle, so the feel of the device is very familiar and comfortable to anyone who’s owned a Samsung Note device in the past. What really stands out to me is that the R9 Plus actually feels really solid and stylish in hand, without getting cumbersome and clumsy.. When you take the sub $700 outright price tag, there’s a bit of a sparkle that gleams from the Oppo that other devices in this size and spec range just don’t have.. Oppo aren’t trying to be something they’re not here, they’re hitting the marks they need to in order to be recognised as a quality device that offers solid, but not bleeding edge performance and reliability at a price that’s affordable (outright) to the average user.. We’ve been lucky enough to have had hands on with the R9 plus for a couple of weeks now and once the initial sparkle of the device wears off, it leaves a solid and positive impression on users. Solid is a a very deliberate choice of wording because that’s what almost everyone who’s had a look at it say “it feels nice and solid“. Not “it’s heavy” or other comments of the like. The solid feel also comes from the construction which leaves no discernible flex when handling it despite the size of the phone.. They physical dimensions aren’t far different to that of the massively popular Galaxy Note 5 and despite being slimmer actually feels like it is slightly more solid in construction. I don’t like bend tests to the extreme that some sites take them to, building special machines to tell us how much pressure it takes to break a phone. Less scientific, but more realistic – I personally “twist” devices along their longest sides to check if there is any noticeable movement and with the R9 Plus there is nothing to report here.. When looking at the build of the R9 Plus it’s pretty clear that Oppo have done a great job of making it a solid, lightweight and good looking device.. Both front and rear cameras are 16MP and sport F/2.0 aperture which makes it capable of good photos in poor light and to reiterate yes, that’s right 16MP SELFIES!!. When we reviewed the R7s we were impressed with the performance of the camera, not only the results in outdoor/good lighting but also in poor lighting conditions and the R9 Plus gives great performance in all lighting conditions too. Not only does the camera perform well but from the time of opening the app it’s ready to take photos in less than a second which is fantastic when you have one of “those” moments as a parent, fleeting and precious – to capture it is magic so to have software on a phone that can be ready to capture moments so quickly is refreshing and the results are very good.. As you would expect on a modern mobile device the R9 Plus camera has all the mod-cons of mobile cameras that allow you to take good photos and be a little artistic with them as well as automatically track time away with Google Photos or other pieces of software. So you’ve got geo-tagging for location awareness, touch focus to allow a specific focus point, face detection for tagging your friends, panorama for those amazing wide angles and HDR to ensure you’re getting the best from your camera.. Already said but I’ll say it again, the camera results are really good in almost any light conditions. It’s not too the level of the Samsung flagships or the recent market leading efforts from the LG G4 and G5 phones but certainly a leader in their price bracket!. When testing the camera it was really opportunistic that there are some greatly varied weather conditions for a few days that have a great feeling for the true capability of the cameras.. So being honest here, Colour OS is far from my favourite option available. To be brutally honest I find it clumsy in areas and a little counter intuitive, that is based on fairly broad experience with various phones and brands. But the addition of a launcher I like (personal preferences are either Nova Launcher or Action Launcher) makes daily use a much more familiar and happier experience.. Taking personal preference in the behaviour of the device out of the equation, there is 2 glaring issues with the device for my mind. The first is that a device that was so recently released comes out of the box with Android 5.1.1 Lollipop which is a real shame and for a number of users possibly a deal breaker. Oppo have confirmed for us that Color OS based on Android 6 is currently in development, so it’s extremely likely (but not guaranteed at this stage) that the R9 Plus will see an Android 6.0 update in the not too distant future.. The second is the amount of space that is consumed when you first turn the phone on, with the OS and a bit of bloat on there you’ve already lost about 12.2GB of the available 64GB of space. I can already hear a few of you saying “so what, there’s still over 50GB free on there”, I agree but thats also a LOT of space chewed up that you won’t ever see. The ability to add in a MicroSD does give a bit of a reprieve but the system software does seem to be using more than it needs to.. Like all the other manufacturers, Oppo have their own take on a web browser, Email client, File explorer and Music Player. Unless you’re brand new to Android it’s quite unlikely you’ll adopt these as a daily driver app vs Chrome, Gmail, Play Music or any of the custom file manager options that you can find on the Play Store. They’ve generally very basic and aimed and the users who just want a really simple option to complete basic tasks.. The general performance of the R9 Plus is more than acceptable to any user, the only time I found any performance issue in my time with the phone was when I was loading something big like a game. It wasn’t hugely noticeable and had I not needed to run it alongside my daily driver I probably wouldn’t have noticed it, but running a couple of side-by-side tests there is an edge to the higher end device in performance there. But the 4GB of memory on the R9 Plus meant that I never felt a need to close down running apps or even once felt as though I needed to reboot to clear some memory.. For me a “normal” day would entail anything up to 8 or 10 calls, SMS by the truckload (handled via Pushbullet usually), email, various productivity apps running, Music, Twitter, the occasional bit of Facebook and often various other tasks involving screen on time. So putting it mildly, I’m not someone who should be reported for abusing the battery of my phone but I’m certainly a heavy user.. This is where the R9 Plus comes into its own, in fact I honestly believe when it comes to battery life that the big players could actually learn something from the battery life that Oppo offer their users. With the same apps that I run daily on my Note 5 and often need to look for a bit of a top up by about 4pm, even on the heaviest of days I was heading for bed with over 30% battery left and on “average” days I could consistently manage 2 days. But here’s the kicker and a bit of cream on the pie that has created my excitement, VOOC charging is fast… really fast.. From barely enough battery to keep the screen on at 2pm (on day 2 of a cycle) to keeping the phone going till nearly 11pm only took 30 minutes on charge. It really is quite astounding that the charge speed is as fast as it is, many of the major manufacturers have adopted this technology now and for users who rely heavily on their phone this is only a good thing.. When you really look closely at the battlefield of battery life, Oppo are doing a great job of showing the far bigger players how to do it right.. Bare with me here, there’s not really any way that you can make the connectivity details of a mobile device exiting but it is very important information. So you’ve got close to a full suite of connectivity starting with the MicroUSB and Nano SIM options which are pretty common these days. While USB C would be very nice, it’s not a mainstream option as yet and as such the mid range manufacturers haven’t adopted it. The biggest missing option when it comes to connectivity is more notable since Android Pay dropped in Australia, NFC. Not all banks support it yet, but the popularity is sure to grow as. For the all important bits that the majority of users look at you’ll need a Nano SIM to connect to the mobile world. The connectivity options we’ve got include Bluetooth 4.1 (NB. No mention in the specs of A2DP) , A-GPS and there’s 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac WiFi so you can connect to pretty much anything that supports WiFi and of course the capability of turning your phone into a WiFi hotspot if you’ve got the data available to burn.. Nearly all of the important mobile bands for Australia covered including 850/900/1800/1900MHz but for those of you on a carrier who are either currently operating on, or considering the 700Mhz band (Telstra and Optus) it may turn a phone like this into a short – medium term solution only to make full use of your network.. So what we’re looking at is a really nice device overall, it’s got a really nice 6 inch screen, solid rear facing camera, one of the best selfie cameras going and plenty of connectivity options but there’s a couple of potential deal breakers for some users – the first being the absence of NFC in the connectivity options and the other being the missing gigs of space thanks to the seemingly bloated OS. NFC will be an all or nothing option for many users, you’re either going to use it or not, but the space issue can be overcome by adding a MicroSD Card to your device.. If you’re able to get past the space and particularly the NFC issue there’s a couple of real highlights to love about the R9 Plus starting with the truly outstanding battery life and solid performance that is going to be more than sufficient for the vast majority of users.. I’d think carefully about it and there’s a few reasons behind this. The device itself is really good and for many users it won’t disappoint, I can’t help but feel that Oppo have missed the mark when it comes to outright pricing though as it will set you back $699 outright from either Oppo online or JB Hifi. This is the sort of price range devices wanting to be a flagship drop at and the R9 Plus feels more like the sort of device that will be an absolute roaring success were it either $150 cheaper outright or available on the sub $50 per month contracts from carriers.. It ticks all the boxes for a lot of users and if you’re in that boat, it could in fact be the best current option for a lot of them so its is absolutely worth a close look.. Does the R9 Plus make your list of phones to look at, or is it missing something you really need?. When people think of top range phones, the likes of Samsung, HTC, LG and more recently (albeit with selected handsets) Huawei come to mind for most users. Oppo are working very hard to catch up to the front runners in the Android race; they’re extremely well recognised in China and they're doing a great job at punching above their weight and are surely at the pointy end of the pack chasing down the top names. So when the chance to review the R9 plus came up following my hugely enjoyable experience with the R7s, I jumped at it. Oppo R9 Plus — Australian Review. Oppo R9 Plus — Australian Review. There’s a couple of real highlights to love about the R9 Plus starting with the truly outstanding battery life and solid performance that is going to be more than sufficient for the vast majority of users.

The only issue I have right now is how to transfer music files (MP3, etc.) to the “Music” tab.. I recently downloaded Wondershare MobileGO so I could add music files to my R9:. – Added all files in Wondershare under “Music” (assuming the files would be listed under “Music” on the phone). – Phone “Music” folder only shows the sample file. – Files / Audio folder shows all “Music” files. Could you please advise how I should resolve this matter?. Share On Facebook Share On Twitter Share On Google. Who cares if it does not have NFC, it is only another function for someone to find a hack for your phone.. Share On Facebook Share On Twitter Share On Google. What many seem to miss is its (and smaller R9) screen quality. It is superb, much better colors than any iPhone and not as oversaturated as SAMSUNG. It is also super easy on the eyes. I do not think there is a better screen yet. But an old Android and “extra apps/features” are real issues, even though most often shared by others as well.. Share On Facebook Share On Twitter Share On Google. You want me to pay $699 for this low-mid range specs? with no NFC, iPhone Copy Cat? HELL NO. Share On Facebook Share On Twitter Share On Google. No Marshmallow and ColorOS sucks balls even more than TouchJizz. And a Snapdragon 6xx series is a $400 phone not a $700 phone.. Share On Facebook Share On Twitter Share On Google. Have they specified a timeframe for Marshmallow? They seem awfully slow to get out updates. Once my warranty is finished, I’ll be installing a 3rd party mod..

You say “Nearly all of the important mobile bands for Australia covered including 850/900/1800/1900MHz but for those of you on a carrier who are either currently operating on, or considering the 700Mhz band (Telstra and Optus) it may turn a phone like this into a short – medium term solution only to make full use of your network.” You have listed the 2G bands here and not the 3G or 4G bands.

Oppo R9 Plus Review: A “Mega”-Pixeled Powerhouse. Zayne Seah June 13, 2016 0 4807. Rear Shot (Auto-Focused on Bright Areas). Android Camera camera phones Oppo Oppo R9 Plus oppo singapore phone reviews Review Selfie smartphone. The Oppo R9 Plus is a remarkable device that has just landed in Singapore. Oppo’s latest selfie-expert, the Oppo R9 just got a massive upgrade in terms of size and batter life. The Oppo R9 Plus is a “phabulous” phablet that seeks to impress. It’s aesthetically-pleasing metal frame along with superb front and rear shooter makes it a force to be reckoned with.. The Oppo R9 looks remarkably similar to Apple’s iPhone, with some minor tweaks in design. The beautifully-designed device has a metallic chassis on the rear as well as a sleek and glossy screen on the front.. The 6-inch phablet has a decent screen-to-body ratio. As a result, gripping it in one hand doesn’t prove to be as difficult as other 6-inch devices in the market. Nevertheless, trying to maneuver and navigate across the phone’s Color OS 3.0 isn’t an easy feat unless you have extremely long fingers that can reach the opposite end of the smartphone screen.. the fingerprint sensor of the device is located on the home button in the front, which is less conveniently located as opposed to the R7’s one at the rear of the phone. Nevertheless, it gets the job done just as well.. The R9 Plus, that’s 7.4 mm thick and 185g in weight feels significantly heavier than the R9. For a 6-inch phone, the weight is still acceptable, but those who prefer a lighter touch should not choose to go for a 6-inch device. However, the heavier weight of the phone is a good trade-off for the massive Li-Po 4120 mAh battery.. The Oppo R9 is a fairly solid device, armed with a fingerprint sensor, 1080 x 1920 pixels Full-HD display, dual-SIM features and 64GB or 128GB worth of storage space which can be expanded to 128GB.. With 64/128GB worth of storage space, the device should work perfectly fine on its own, even if you are a serial binge-watcher. Nevertheless, if you firmly insist on downloading all 6 seasons of Game of Thrones in full-HD, you can add in a microSD to expand your storage space till 128GB, ensuring you never run into memory issues.. There are 2 slots you can fit your Nano-SIM into the Oppo R9 Plus. However, should you choose to insert a memory card into one of them, you will not be able to use the other slot for a SIM card.. The Oppo R9 Plus fares well, which can only be expected from a mid-high range phone.. The device is armed with the new Snapdragon 652 processor. This isn’t as powerful as the highest end 820 processor, but it gets the job done well enough. With 4GB worth of RAM on this device, multi-tasking should feel like a breeze.. AnTuTu Benchmarks gave this device a score of 84286 which was comparable to the Huawei P9’s 91711 and Samsung Galaxy Note 5’s 83944.. My personal experience with it was smooth and lag-free. It wasn’t the snappiest phone out there, but it was more than enough. Running multiple productivity apps on the go such as Docs, Sheets, Chrome amongst many other apps didn’t see much of a decline in performance.. The device also didn’t overheat much, if at all when being used intensely for long duration.. The Oppo R9 Plus holds a Adreno 510 GPU, which is a pretty good graphics processor.. Running normal games didn’t tax the R9 Plus at all. Intensive games on the other hand, causes the R9 Plus to freeze a little at some points, but the experience was fairly smooth overall.. ES 3.1 tests gave it 327.1 Frames, which is above the Samsung S6 Edge, but lower than the Sony Xperia X, showing that the device can hold its water in the gaming field, but is most definitely not a dedicated device for gamers.. The R9 Plus is one of the best Android camera-phones in the market. It’s rear and front camera are equally impressive.. The 16 MP, f/2.0 camera on both the front and rear strikes a good balance between a strong resolution and light sensitivity. The Hi-Light software also helps the device capture decent shots even in low-light conditions that destroy most Android cameras.. The front camera was equally, if not more impressive than the rear camera. With beauty mode amongst a whole range of shooting modes, the Oppo R9 Plus has an impressive camera not only due to its strong hardware, but well-thought out camera software as well.. My favourite part of the selfie shooter was basically having a mode where you can wave your hand at the camera to take a selfie without using a self-timer.. You simply do not have to worry about running out of battery at all. The Oppo R9 Plus should last you more than a day without recharging, even if you are a heavy smartphone user like me.. The Oppo R9 Plus runs the latest Color OS 3.0. Like other Chinese phones, for instance Xiaomi’s Mi OS, the Colo OS 3.o can be quite rigid despite its many strong points.. Transferring your old contacts, apps and backups from your previous Android devices is tedious and troublesome since it doesn’t allow you to auto-restore your old image from your previous phone.. The Color OS also automatically halts and closes other applications in the background in an effort to keep the system power efficient and fast. Whilst this is a great thing most of the time, there are potential pitfalls. For instance, using Google Fit to track a run is an issue since going back to the “Home Screen” will halt the run, and when you return to the app, you find a disappointing notice to tell you that the app did not track your run.. Nevertheless, this “smart” feature of the Color OS actually saves you a tremendous load of battery and RAM space, which allows the device to run smoothly and at extremely long periods of time.. The Color OS is very aesthetically pleasing. The flat look of it gives off a classic and yet simplistic design that most users should not have difficulty navigating.. If you don’t like the Color OS, you can always download Google Now as your default launcher to replace it.. Using the Oppo R9 Plus was an absolute delight. It was smooth, snappy and user friendly. The gestures you could use to activate commonly used apps like WhatsApp made it incredibly convenient for those who live and breathe on their smartphone.. The fingerprint sensor on the front worked extremely fast as well. However, your device will not unlock from sleep mode like the R7, which was something I felt Oppo should have kept.. Apart from the slight disintegration from the Google ecosystem, the Oppo system fared nicely.. The Oppo R9 Plus is a sweet phablet that is more than a larger version of the Oppo R9. The improvements in processor speed and battery life were more significant than the increase in the screen size of the device. If you are in the market for a phablet, the Oppo R9 Plus at. $769 (64GB) and $849 (128GB), the device isn’t the cheapest, but definitely value-for-money.. The Oppo R9 Plus is an amazing and aesthetically-pleasing smartphone that packs on 2 powerful cameras on it's metallic 6-inch frame.. A tech geek going beyond specs..

Oppo R9 Plus - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 … 10 11 ». Shite phone, poor WiFi, poor cellular reception, crap camera, antique os with no updates. anyone tell me difference between oppo r9 and oppo r9 ant one plzzzzz. Lim, 23 Dec 2016 Oppo R9 Plus, If you want to use two Sims, Don't buy it because Oppo R9+ is not real dual Sim,... more You can right, I also get the same shit. But to be fair I got mine from lazada which got it direct from China. Local OPPO can upgrade but not form China. Oppo have one tiny problem, the bluetooth signal is bad, connected to a bluetooth ear phone, the momnet i put my phone in the bag or even my pants pocket, the signal is lost. Tired on 2 models of oppo, same problem, iphone and sumsung do not have this problem. Note: i try the same earphone on all the device.. Good phone, used for more than a year no problem. Vera, 18 Mar 2017 Can volume for media, alarm, notifications and ring tone be separated? Seems to be one volu... more i need help, my r9s plus cant use sign up weibo with my country number phone (indonesian). I used this phone almost 5 months I loved it. it is perfect nice phone. Paid $800 and expected software that works. Default messaging app - only allows 15 messages to be sent. On top of that it will try and send group messages to a random mix of emails and home phone numbers. It does not choose mobile numbers. To make matters worse if you change to a third party app like textra it comes up with a crappy message " For you messages security, system message app has been set as the default message app." WTF OPPO. On top of that it is a flag ship phone and it is only running Marshmellow 6.0 and not Nougat 7.1. with no timeframe for updates if at all. To make matters even worse the phone is made in two different factories and has two totally different motherboards with two different cpu's so if you can find a rom to flash it may brick your phone... You have to download cpuid or something to check... I have rung the help department so many times... Ok and one more thing, it started to bloat and we could not delete temp files... I ended up with 60GB of temp files and had to flash the phone to stock. In the process a message came up "memory full - do you want to transfer to your sd card - I said yes - It wiped all my photos. Initially thought it was good value but after 3 months of use I would like to destroy it. It does so many things wrong and unexplainable changes or loses a web page stops working suddenly for a while and there are so many features that a very difficult nigh impossible to remove ie: lock screen photo that I unfortunately added. Wished I had stuck with Samsung.. Anonymous, 18 Mar 2017 I love the half hour charge time to get battery to 100%. It would have been a per... more Failed download tasks can be deleted by swiping to the left. Blackhornet17, 25 Mar 2017 Its the launcher you are talking about not the phone. Try Apex or Nova from the google playsto... more I like color OS it's just perfect for me no extra launcher necessary. Got week ago from China black model. Since I use before S5 it's a big step for me how big is phone. I didnt have any problem to set up all stuff, my m8 from China set up it on ENG and rest I do myself. There is only a bit problematic set up push notification for some apps but after a while I figure how to allow all apps to show push notifications. Camera is very nice, for my taste maybe too high brightnes but autofocus work perfect. Selfie camera is also pretty ok. I am not amazed with video but it's ok. Battery is pretty cool 2 days with decent use for big phone like this one is for me ok. Charging with vooc is pretty fast... ColorOS is hm, um somehow odd but since I am not too much for custom customazation I am ok with it. Maybe they can find better solution for photo section and how to orginize it, but there is plenty other apps for it. Overall I am pretty satisfied with phone. 4g work good and everything else.. Anonymous, 05 Jan 2017 don't believe you i have one and it works fine yeah....don't belived your statement also! Mine works perfectly well on 4G.. finally i got my self a oppo R9plus yesterday. I've been using Oppo find 7 and loving Oppo brand ever since. As i find now R9 if ringstone for notifications could separated & volume like find 7 even better!. Anonymous, 05 Jan 2017 don't believe you i have one and it works fine Go to service centre and upgrade to both 4G.. I got the R9s Plus with Woolworths Mobile in Australia three weeks ago, phone works flawlessly, no real complains - a former iphone user, glad I made the switch. Came across a problem where the Personal Hotspot (either via wireless, usb or bluetooth) does not let data through to the connected device. There was no issues with the connection, just no data passes through. Have spoken with Woolworths Mobile and Oppo Support but they were unable to resolve the issue, a replacement phone is on the way... This is rather frustrating cos I spent alot of time setting up and customising the phone. Anyone out there experiencing the same issue? Provide some details if possible.... OppoFoneOwner, 23 Dec 2016 Shit quality software. Never gonna get that Nougat or Marshmallow update. more Its the launcher you are talking about not the phone. Try Apex or Nova from the google playstore. It will transform your phone into what you were probably used to on normal android but allows so much more (nova allows 12 horizontal rows of icons on one homescreen). You just have to tweak it a bit by changing the UI. Anonymous, 23 Dec 2016 Probably the best performing phone I have ever used.. One complaint only----- No menu button! Use a different launcher. I used apex for years but use nova now because it allows 12 horizontal rows of icons on one homescreen. I never used their standard launcher. I downloaded nova as soon as i bought the phone as i have done with my previous sansungs. It completely changes the UI and is soooo so so customisable its ridiculous. I have one homescreen with all the apps I use just on that screen and have a big weather widget as well. And paying for the premium versions is worth it for the extra settings.. I love the half hour charge time to get battery to 100%. It would have been a perfect phone if it can delete failed download tasks. Under Settings - Download Management - Manage Tasks, only has "Pause" and "Continue ". Please add "Delete " so that can remove tasks that cannot be completed. Secondly, it will really make it more worthy of its price if the volume control is split for Ringtone, Notifications, Media and Alarm. Looking forward to these improvements in its software update!.

Gorgeous huge 6" screen, fast fingerprint sensor, great for selfies. OPPO R9 Plus Review – Unboxing Video. OPPO R9 Plus Review – Packaging. OPPO R9 Plus Review – Design & Features. OPPO R9 Plus Review – If bigger means better for you, then go for it. The OPPO R9 Plus, launched officially in Australia today and available to purchase at JB HI-Fi, has a huge 6″ 1080p display that makes it perfect for content consumption.. Compare it to the OPPO R9 , the R9 Plus also features the Snapdragon 652 chipset (compared to R9’s MediaTek MT6755), bigger battery, and improved rear camera.. OPPO includes a really nice case to go with the phone on the get go. A neat and air-bubbles-free screen protector has also been applied on the screen so you can use the phone straight away, fully protected. In a surprising move, there are also different ear tips option, which is generous.. The OPPO R9 Plus has the same design as the OPPO R9 in terms of look and feel. It’s slim, elegant, and a beauty to behold.. Considering the price range and that the OPPO R9 Plus is supposed to be a mid-range smartphone, its metalic look feels just like a premium, high-end smartphone from all sides.. The super thin bezel gives a fuller experience when you are staring at the beautiful screen, however at the expense of frequent accidental touches. Since the screen does not have a palm rejection feature, playing games often got interrupted when I had to wiggle my thumb to reach certain areas on the screen.. For watching videos on the device however, the edge-to-edge display gives you a much better experience when it comes to immersion. Or when you are reading content like breaking news on your favourite news app.. The R9 Plus light sensor seems to be more stable this time compared to the OPPO R9 and doesn’t drastically change the brightness intermittently when set to Auto.. OPPO ColorOS 3.0 is smooth and also eye-pleasing. There are quite a lot of attention to details in the design. For example, the Clock app icon background will turn to black during the evening, and back to white when the daylight comes. There are also other small, nice touches.. Unfortunately, the OS is somewhat quite unpolished in critical areas such as app notifications – and this has been going on for quite some time, even on the previous OPPO devices I’ve reviewed such as the OPPO R9 and OPPO R7s. The problem was that I couldn’t get some notifications from certain apps such as Swipes (a task/to-do app) if the apps are not launched for some time (i.e frozen in the background, or closed).. The workaround is to lock important apps (by going to the app switcher and drag the app down to lock it – this can be done by pressing the soft-touch button on the left of the Home button). This seems to fix the problem which is probably caused by the OS trying to save battery.. An OPPO representative at the Whirlpool forums also mentioned that apps on Android are installed with default setting of ‘app freeze’ enabled (under Settings->Battery->Others) which needs to be turned off. I did find that locking the app did the job perfectly, though.. The problem is, this “workaround” makes the phone somewhat not so easy to use, as new smartphone owners may not know about these things and would think the phone as a faulty. It hinders me personally from giving my OPPO phone to my mom, who’s not comfortable with technology.. With a 4,120mAh battery, OPPO R9 Plus can survive even the longest day with plenty of juice left. When I used it heavily, I still had around half of the battery left by midnight (usually it’d be around 37% battery left on the iPhone 6s ). And thanks to OPPO VOOC Flash Charge, topping it up is really quick in times of need.. OPPO R9 Plus’ 4GB RAM combined with the 8-core processor give a good amount of power for a smooth operation on the device. Frame rates drop a little bit occasionally when playing games but nothing that would make you frustrated over it. Thanks to all the power, fingerprint recognition is the fastest I’ve ever experienced – similar to the OPPO R9.. Want to know how fast #OPPO #R9 0.2 secs fingerprint unlock is? @OPPOMobileAU pic.twitter.com/DBgNsR8YAY. — Michael Aulia (@michaelaulia) May 4, 2016. It’s so fast that unlocking the phone is a mere trivial task with zero frustration (according to the spec, it takes 0.2 seconds approximately to unlock the phone).

(in both front and rear cameras) take awesome shots. when there are plenty of light or when you are. In low lit condition, the camera suffers a bit as you can see from these photos where some details are lost. It also looks like there are post-processing being done to reduce noise.. Obviously you shouldn’t compare the night shots to a high-end device like the Samsung Galaxy S7, which costs much more than the OPPO R9 Plus.. OPPO R9 Plus is a great smartphone for content consumption, thanks to its gorgeous 6″ screen with thin bezel and huge battery to last more than a day. The cameras (both front and rear) take great shots assuming you have a good amount of light. Selfie lovers would definitely be loving OPPO R9 Plus too as its front camera gets a lot of love.. The thin bezel is great for immersion but in my opinion, it gives me more accidental soft-button presses than I can remember. ColorOS is great too, but requires a workaround to make sure you get all app notifications. However, if you are comfortable tinkering with settings and do not have a big budget, the OPPO R9 Plus’. AU $699 is definitely very enticing.. The OPPO R9 Plus is available at JB Hi-Fi in either Gold or Rose Gold colour option..

Things were transparent and Oppo was quite good at providing GPL-mandated sources. Unfortunately not everything is as great as it was and sources are often. Hopefully that trend will be reverted with two new devices of the Chinese manufacturer have just been presented on TENAA.. The R9 and R9 Plus models are mid-range devices powered by Android 5.1. It’s quite a shame, as Android Marshmallow has been publicly available for a relatively long time. Android 5.1 might be considered a drawback, but the R9 and R9 Plus are interesting models nonetheless.. Oppo R9 sports a 5.5-inch Full HD AMOLED display with a very thin (1.66 mm) frame. It’s using the MediaTek’s Helio P10 as its processor. RAM amount should not be an issue as it comes with 4 GB, a good standard. To wrap things up we have 64 GB of storage (expandable), a 13MP rear camera with f/2.2 aperture and 4K video, 16MP front facing ‘Pegasus’ camera, fingerprint sensor and a capacious 2,850mAh battery with VOOC Flash Charge (2 hours use from 5 mins plugged in).. The R9 Plus sports a more developer-friendly Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 CPU and more capacious. 4,210mAh battery with VOOC Flash Charge. The screen of the device is also bigger. The display is 6-inch big and Full HD resolution.. Oppo claims that the newest incarnation of the ColorOS is 25% faster than its predecessor. It consumes less battery on the CPU operations. The R9 Plus is believed to last up to one day of usage, which is a nice result. A new display manufacturing process allows for making a phone with incredibly slim bezels. Oppo reduced the glue spray area but increased the amount of glue to keep the display’s layers together as well.. Oppo R9 Plus will hit the market in less than a month on April 12 th while the regular model will be released on April 24 th. cost ¥2799 ($430) for the R9 and ¥3299 ($505) for the R9 Plus..

The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

4.0 from 9 reviews. Your trust is our top concern. Companies can't alter or remove reviews from ProductReview.com.au.. Great phone for a great price. 5 out of 5 ,. I've had the R9 Plus for a year now and not once has it faulted. Screen size is great, display is great and battery life is wonderful. I have gone a max of 3 days without charging (and minimal use) and haven't needed to charge. The VOOC flash charge is needed as the battery is huge but it goes from 0 to 100 within an hour and a half. Can't fault this phone and very very happy with my purchase, even after a year it runs great!. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. I have been using this phone for two years, I think this product is really convenient to use, and with a brilliant camera, I could take beautiful photos. And the fast charging ability of this phone is very convenient, really worth it’s price, I would recommend this product to others.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. Got this phone on a virgin mobile plan and am pretty happy with it. - Massive battery lasts 2 days very easily. - cant change message ringtone or email ring tone. - cracked the screen and it costs $250 to replace in sydney. Only 2 people do it due to it being very difficult to do. - limited android capability due to it running colourOS. - 4G issues with Virgin Network. Overall it will do what you need it to and the battery outlasts most phones. For the price it will definately not disappoint and will suprise most people.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. I love the oppo phones, super reliable, fast and easy!. 4 out of 5 ,. I personally love the oppo phones, it is perfect if you love the iPhone but do not use apple products or wish to make a change. The reason why I say this is because the oppo runs so similar to the iPhone, they are very alike but also very different. The best thing I found about oppo is that it is super fast, has a long battery life, the camera quality is amazing, everything is super easy to access and it is not a complicated phone at all. It is also very light weight and Slim. The phone itself looks very stylish. I would say that over the course of all the phones I have owned, oppo is Definitely my favourite. I like simple and easy but also efficient and oppo gives me that. I would definitely recommend trying an oppo phone and would suggest it to anyone that asked.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. Bought outright to take advantage of better plans. The display is the best I've found with a sound production that allows total hands free use. Connectivity is intuitive and allows me enjoy music without loss of quality. It's size is a bonus I feel but it won't fit too well into smaller pockets. Will keep this as long as I can.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 2 out of 5 ,. Never buy oppo mobile from any where. they are not really helpful people to solve your problem. my phone is faulty i tried to contact them to solve problem but they are not really helpful to solve my problem. please dont buy any oppo mobiles. June 13th 2017 Update: unhappy customer from oppo. I just bought oppo R9 plus nov 2016 from first day headphone is broken than after one week of time my phone voice keep breaking during the call i complained to company they told me to send repair i did that. when its back from reapir but i dont think so they fix that problem i booked repaired i explain them to another problem also about camera quality is not good. after that i try to contact customer care to solve my problem they told me to we need to send you mobile to again repair department to observation. all rubbish thing they told me i requested to send me another mobile because i think this one is faulty but they are not helpful i am struggling last 6 months. i request to you people dont buy phone who dont have shop around you and not good in service. i am very unhappy customer with oppo.

Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 1 person found this helpful, do you?. 4 out of 5 ,. Let me cut to the chase. On the exterior, this is a great phone. The only issue with it is the software. If you don't like ColorOS, or having to use a Custom Launcher, then don't pick up this phone. But, if those things don't bother you, this phone is great! Large (6"), bright AMOLED screen, long lasting 4,100 mah battery, fast charging, the whole nine yards. Plus, it recently received Android 6.0 (With ColorOs on the top of it) So it is a lot more usable now. Perfect if you love to stream, watch Youtube or listen to music with the large 64gb internal storage, plus it supports external media (Micro SD) and Dual-Sim.( But then you can't use the MicroSd) All in all, it's a great buy for the price.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 1 person found this helpful, do you?. Great battery life, missing a few features.. 4 out of 5 ,. The battery on this phone goes on for 2 days with full use. The display is large, bright and clear. The fingerprint reader is faster than a Samsung S7. There are a few features missing:. NFC - no tap and pay. Fingerprint reader not recognised by Westpac banking. Notifications from some apps missing: e.g alarms don't always go off or do 2-30 mins late (I'm using Timely, which works perfectly on other phones). Upcoming events don't pop up: when you hear the faint buzzing you have to go to the notifications panel yourself and click on the notice to see. Limited number of widgets: you have to install a 3rd party launcher such as Atom or Nova Launcher to get the full suit of widgets for all apps. With all it's faults the battery life is the winner. I gave away my Samsung S7 for this.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 1 person found this helpful, do you?. Upgrade to Android 6.x to get fingerprint sign-on for Westpac banking. The camera lacks image stabilisation, which makes for poor images in low light. You have to keep the time app open for the alarm to work!. The Oppo product guy at JB hifi sorted out the notification issue. Run whatever apps you need to keep running - Timely, Garmin Connect IQ, etc. Click on the button to the left of the home button to.... Not the worst, but very out dated.. 3 out of 5 ,. I bought this 2016 September, the beginning was great & so excited. the battery life was great till 5 months & start decreasing very soon. charging takes ages & sometimes its just heating up & not charging as well. on the bright side, both front & rear cameras are great!. software is very out dated & never gets any android updates. most of the time its getting very slow & have to restart few times a day. size wise its large & love the 6" screen. I was a medium apple user & changed for this one for a different experience. but will never go for this again. Very poor customer service @ woolworth made me never go for any Oppo products again..
