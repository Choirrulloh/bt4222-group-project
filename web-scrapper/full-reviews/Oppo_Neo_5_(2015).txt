No other issue but the battery. My OPPO Neo 5 and was so look so simple and the design and display of it was nice and it was portable I can bring it anywhere I want to go so love to used it much. I can operate it easily and it not difficult smartphone so much nice. All the applications can response quickly so nice cause I have a good using on it. The camera on this phone has a good quality of image so much nice good for selfie and all. The volume of the speaker also was loud and I can hear louder. The battery life of this smartphone has long so I can used it for a long period of time.. almost a year b skin ko... 1 1/2 year n it's still astg..... Review by Celso Nino Tokitomo Eustaquio. kindly pa nman sken c oppo sa ngaun 4Months na sya sa palad at sa mga mata ko mssbe kng matibay tlga sya literally alm nio kng bk8 sa 4months ni oppo sken tlga nga nman matibay ang 'EAR PHONE" Nito nabuhol..nahugot..nalaglag at kh8 nagkagnun man ndi pdin nagbbgo ang 'SOUNDS' nya malinaw pdin.d tulad ng ibang earphone na mabbli sa CDR king aabot lng sau ng 1week ..at left or right lng ang buhay na earpone..peo ndi earpone ang basehan dpat sa cp din..mgnda sna kng removable ung battery nya pra kpag lobat ung isa icha2Rge ko sa unversal charger..mtgal din sya malobat kpag ndi ka magplay ng games with internet..peo ok ndin sya I-OPPHONE STYLE nman eh ung LIKOD nyahaha. Itong OPPO Neo 5 (2015) ko ay simple lang din naman ang design at ang display nito pero ang gnada naman din nito para sa akin. Ang gaan pa din naman dalhin nito kaya ang ayos. Madali lang din naman ang pag gamit nito kaya hindi na ako mahihirapan sa pag gamit nito. Mabilis din naman ang processing speed nito ang bilis ko din naman maka download ng mga applications at games sa smartphone ko. Ang ganda rin naman ng camera nito mapa harap man o likod ay ang ganda ng kuha kasi ang linaw talaga pwede na ring hindi mag edit sa mga pictures. Ang lakas din naman ng volume nito kaya maririnig ko ng maayos ang kauasap ko at ang mga music. Ang tagal din naman malowbat nitong smartphone n aito kaya ang sulit.. This is not a phone for you if your first priority is taking selfies and pictures. Compared to other phones with the same camera specs 8mp main, 2mp front , this oppo's camera is pixelated even when you take picture outdoor.. Storage is good, I had bought a 16gb internal storage.. Touch sensitivity response is okay, smooth.. Speed is OK, it doesn't lag (yet) because of 1gb ram and a quad core processor. I just tried subway surf, and other semi high graphic games.. Screen is good, no bad angle, you can view on any angle, without the screen getting dark.. The battery is non-removable, i haven't tried a non-removable battery before so i don't know its advantage yet, but i thinks its not good because if your battery were damaged, you have to bring it to a technician to install and replace the battery, unlike the removable, you just buy it from a store and put it youself.. Price? At Php4990, i don't think I'm getting what I paid for. I can sacrifice internal memory over a camera.. generally very good quality phone, long lasting...d po xia nghang 1yr old na akin oppo phone wla probz mey anti scratch cia kht wala screen protector d cia na gasgas...thx oppo..... kakabili ko pa lang neto last sunday. At first hesitant ako na bilhin ang oppo kase samsung ang gusto ko kase subok na, nadala ata ako sa sales talk ng dizer. mabilis ang processor at maganda ang cam. and yes para ngang iphone ang cam niya, gusto ko din ung gestures niya para hindi agad masira un power and volume buttons. worried lang ako sa battery kase non-removable tas nagautomatic shutdown siya kapag 1% na lang unlike samsung but all in all hindi ka magsisisi dito kase affordable na hindi pa tipid sa specs at kayang ioffer. Hindi lang brand ang binayaran mo kase sure na maganda siya.. Bumili ako ng oppo neo5 nung last friday, gusto ko xa kc very light xa soft touch. The battery is ok naman d xa madling malobat pag d ka ng momobile data. The cam is good I like it kc iphone ung cam nya the back cam is really good as well as the front cam.. Jusy wondering about the light sensor kc ung isa ng rered xa tas ung side nya hnd umiilaw ba ang light sensor nyo guys thank you.

Literally this Oppo Neo 5 phone is the best phone so far in terms of internet in mobile guys , When it comes to functionality and operability I salute the quality of this phone even if it is new and not known brand but still this Oppo proves that they can also compete of other branded smartphone , well I just enjoyed using this smartphone of Oppo unlimited internet and unlimited apps downloaded, bigger storage internal but the RAM is only 1GB , so guys just try this Oppo , it has cool camera and speaker so this can be your entertainment gadget... Oppo neo 5 panibago na naman itong pagkakaguluhan, kasi mas mura ito na smartphone , Hindi nga lang kilala pa sa ngayon pero ito na yung phone ko last month pa ito nabili , so far naman maayos yung functionaliy nito lalo na yung battery mas matagal yung life span nito.... Okay sana ang mga features ng phone na ito. Pero hindi ito nag a-update ng kanilang Android version di tulad ng ibang company tulad ng Huawei, Xiaomi, at iba pang brands. Nagre-release lang sila ng ... Great design phone with sleek specs. I thought super mahal ang phone na ito ng makita ko siya sa online hindi pala ganun ka mahal expected ko sa phone na ito na sa 15 thousand ang ganda kasi ng design attractive itong masyado and also ...

Updated On: 26th February 2018. 3.6 389 Ratings 1 Questions & Answers. Oppo Neo 5 2015 is an Android 4.4 KitKat smartphone. It has a 4.5-inch display with FWVGA (854x480 pixels) resolution. It comes with an 8MP primary camera with LED flash and a 2MP front camera. The phone is powered by a 1.3GHz quad-core MediaTek processor. The Oppo Neo 5 2015 has 1GB of RAM , 8GB of internal storage and a microSD slot. Connectivity options include GPRS, EDGE, 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Micro USB. It is fuelled by a 2,000 mAh battery .. Best Price: ₹ 12,000. Key Specifications 1GB RAM 8GB internal storage 2000 mAh battery 8 M.Pixels rear & 2 M.Pixels selfie 4.5 inch screen Dual SIM (Nano-SIM/ Micro-SIM) Android OS, v4.4.2 (KitKat). Oppo Neo 5 2015 Price in India. Oppo Neo 5 2015 Price starts at Rs. The lowest price of Oppo Neo 5 2015 is at Amazon. Neo 5 2015 is not available in other online stores.. The Neo 5 2015, as the name suggests, is the 2015 edition of the Neo 5, a device that was launched by the Chinese manufacturer Oppo in 2014. The phone is powered by a MediaTek processor and is the 3G -only variant of the Oppo Neo 5s.. The Neo 5 2015 features a metallic design that Oppo says is extremely sturdy, and despite the metal, helps in effectively dissipating heat. Smartphones like the Xiaomi Mi4i have been criticised for their heat issues, and Oppo is no doubt looking to make sure the same problems don't affect the Neo 5. The phone has a 4.5-inch display on the front, with an extremely modest resolution of 854x480 pixels, putting the device squarely in the low-end segment.. Performance on the Neo 5 should be impressive thanks to the 1.7GHz MediaTek processor churning numbers under the hood and the low display resolution. 1GB of RAM accompanies the processor for keeping things running smoothly even when a lot of apps are running in the background, while a quad-core Mali-400MP2 GPU provides the power for media and gaming.. The primary camera on the Neo 5 2015 is an 8-megapixel sensor with an f/2.2 lens and an LED flash, which is expected to take average photos given the megapixel count. On the front resides a 2-megapixel camera for selfie capture and for video calls. The front camera has an f/2.8 lens, meaning it will capture noticeably less light than the back camera.. The Oppo Neo 5 2015 has 8GB of internal storage. That might not be a lot in today's day and age for this price segment, but as is usually the case with entry-level smartphones, the Oppo Neo 5 offers a microSD slot for adding more storage (though only a maximum of 32GB is supported.) Of course, with music streaming services gaining popularity, users will be able to save some space by simply listening to music on the internet instead of storing them on the device itself.. The device has a 2,000 mAh battery that should be able to drive usage of up to a day. On the software front, the Oppo Neo 5 2015 runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat. There is no word on when the phone will get Android 5.0 Lollipop, and it's disappointing that Oppo hasn't decided to ship the device with Lollipop out of the box..

Oppo Neo 5 (2015) Review: Underpowered and Overshadowed. Jamshed Avari , 28 July 2015. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Oppo made quite a splash when it debuted in India, being one of the first value-minded brands to compete with the likes of Samsung and Sony. Since then, things have slowed down a bit with newer launches from Xiaomi , Coolpad and other smaller Chinese brands stealing Oppo's thunder. Value charts have been rewritten countless times in the past year and we've now come to a point where some truly remarkable devices are available for less than Rs. 10,000 - devices that would have cost twice as much not too long ago.. The company's latest launch is the Oppo Neo 5 (2015) , which replaces an older model also named Oppo Neo 5 but looks nothing like it. 9,990 , it will have to fend off the horde of capable budget devices currently available in the market, several of which are priced significantly lower, at Rs. This will be an interesting competition.. Look and feel When we look at the Oppo Neo 5 (2015), we can't help but feel we've seen it before. That's because the design formula of a flat front and back with a metallic band around the sides has been done to death by multiple companies, all trying to ape the iconic iPhone 4/4S look. Lava's Iris Pro models, in particular, stand out as examples of this.. Our review unit was made of white plastic with a dull gold band. The capacitive button icons below the screen and the rings around the camera lens and flash on the rear are also metallic, but for some reason, silver. The phone is tall and narrow, with quite a lot of white space above and below the screen but relatively thin borders on the sides. The only real flash of personality this phone has is the patterned speaker grille on the lower rear.. The power button is on the left and the volume rocker on the right, which took some getting used to. There's only a 3.5mm audio jack on top and the Micro-USB port and a mic hole on the bottom. The rear panel is removable but the battery is sealed in - you'll find only one Micro-SIM slot, one Nano-SIM slot and a microSD slot.. The construction quality of the phone as well as its bundled accessories seems good. In terms of grip, we definitely prefer curves over hard edges like the ones the Neo 5 (2015) has, and it dug into our palms with prolonged usage. The top edge also felt scratchy against our ears.. Specifications and software Considering its price, the Oppo Neo 5 (2015) comes across as a phone that's out of touch with the current market scenario. While 720p screens have become common at much lower price points, this phone has a lowly resolution of 480x854, which translates to a density of just 218ppi at 4.5 inches diagonally. The difference is immediately apparent, and we were underwhelmed from the moment we turned this phone on.. The processor is a MediaTek MT6582, which was quite common in last year's bargain-basement phones. It has four cores running at 1.3GHz, and integrated Mali-400MP2 graphics. The 1GB of RAM is also disappointing. 8GB of storage is not too bad, but you can bump that up by only 32GB using a microSD card. You also get Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, FM radio and A-GPS, but no 4G. There's an accelerometer, compass, ambient light sensor and proximity sensor. The non-removable battery is rated at 2,000mAh. The primary camera has an 8-megapixel sensor but is limited to 720p video recording, and the secondary camera comes in at 2 megapixels.. Oppo's custom skin is called Color OS, and we've used it before. Unfortunately the Neo 5 (2015) is still based on Android 4.4.2. You can choose from a handful of widgets, wallpapers, effects and themes, which give you some cosmetic control over the interface. The task switcher is called up by long-tapping the capacitive Menu button. Oppo bundles a Security Centre app that, despite its name, also includes a power manager, notifications disabler, data monitor and memory cleanup tool.. Guest Mode lets you designate contacts, photos and apps that are hidden from prying eyes, and Permission Monitor lets you see what your apps are doing behind your back. We aren't really fans of Oppo's custom keyboard and icons, and the photos app felt sluggish. On the other hand, it was nice to have lots of quick toggles in the notifications shade, and the Settings app is neatly organised.. Overall, the spec sheet reads like one we should have come across a year or more ago. The Oppo Neo 5 (2015) is thoroughly outmatched by its competition today. It almost feels as though the company designed this model last year but only just found a few crates full of them sitting forgotten in a warehouse somewhere and decided to sell them anyway (we checked, though, and our review unit's date of manufacturing was June 2015). Oppo knows this but points to its camera quality and other intangible features that make up for it, which we will have to see for ourselves.. Performance We went into the benchmarking phase of our review with low expectations, and were not surprised by what we found. The Neo 5 (2015) seemed to do okay with day-to-day usage, but struggled with our tests indicating that heavy games and apps wouldn't run. If you like bouncing between lots of apps and browser tabs, you might run into bottlenecks that other phones in the market today do not face.. Despite the low-resolution screen, graphics scores were terrible. The phone was only able to push out 9.6fps in GFXbench, and the scores of 3,228 and 2,090 respectively in 3DMark Ice Storm and Ice Storm Extreme were well below current averages. AnTuTu and Quadrant's scores came in at 18,703 and 7,269 respectively.. Contrary to Oppo's hopes, we were disappointed with the camera. Shots taken on a slightly cloudy day in Mumbai came out overexposed and full of noise. There was no pop to the colours we captured, and detailing and texture were completely lost. Things deteriorated even further when inspected at full size on a desktop monitor. Shots taken at night were completely unusable unless there was a lot of incident light. The flash worked to light subjects up, but robbed them of whatever little detail they might have had. We've seen a lot better from phones that cost a lot less.. The Oppo Neo 5 (2015) had trouble with our heavier 1080p video files, but 720p ones played without artefacts or stuttering. The speaker on the back proved to be pretty loud and sound was clear at high volumes, though not very rich or warm. Battery life was the biggest silver lining to this phone's dark cloud; we were able to get a respectable 8 hours, 19 minutes of runtime in our video loop test. We were also pleased to see that the battery level didn't dip much when the phone was left idle. We'd expect users to get at least a full day out of each charge.. Verdict It is clear that this phone is overpriced and thus cannot hope to compete in terms of features and specifications alone. Therefore, we spent quite a bit of time looking for evidence of any redeeming factor, including the camera, which Oppo itself pointed out to us. Our findings show that it will take a lot to remain competitive in the low-cost smartphone market, and even those who disrupted the market at one time can have the carpet pulled out from under then.. We'd advise anyone interested in this phone to do a quick scan of the market and compare prices, specifications and benchmark numbers. The Xiaomi Redmi 2 ( Review | Pictures ) Coolpad Dazen 1 ( Review | Pictures) and Lenovo A6000 Plus ( Review | Pictures ) are just a few of the lower-priced choices that perform just as well as or better than this phone. At the same price level, you could also consider the Infocus M330 ( Review ) and Lenovo K3 Note , or for just a little more there's the Motorola Moto G (Gen 2) ( Review | Pictures )..

Therefore, we spent quite a bit of time looking for evidence of any redeeming factor, including the camera, which Oppo itself pointed out to us. Our findings show that it will take a lot to remain competitive in the low-cost smartphone market, and even those who disrupted the market at one time can have the carpet pulled out from under then. We'd advise anyone interested in this phone to do a quick scan of the market and compare prices, specifications and benchmark numbers. Subscribe for the latest tech news.

Oppo Neo 5 2015 Price in India. 6990/- Buy Now Set Price Drop Alert. Oppo Neo 5 Review: If phones are priced according to their performance, the Oppo Neo 5 is a mistake.. If phones are supposed to be priced according to their specs, then the Oppo Neo 5 is a mistake. If they're supposed to be priced based on performance, it doesn't live up to the Rs. It is a mediocre phone, at a steep price and loses out in almost all aspects. Almost every smartphone in the sub-10k range is a better choice.. PROS Tried and tested design Compact size. CONS Average performance Sub-par camera Poor sound quality High price. Please enter your email to be informed whenever the price of this product reaches your Target Price.

In a world where budget devices are getting better by the day,. Oppo has launched the Neo 5 2015, a good looking and rather robust phone for the budget buyer. the phone feels good in the hand and UI feels snappy, but it has its issues.. The device is made up of plastic and it tries to mimic. the premium look and feel of the iPhone 4S. The fit and finish of panels and the power and volume rocker button, feel. The smaller footprint of the phone makes it quite ergonomic and easy to hold, compared to other phones in its price range.. Design-wise, I think Oppo's is trying to play safe by mimicking a classic design like the iPhone 4S. And, even though it is plastic, it feels good enough. However, all its tricks fall apart one by one. which try to give an upmarket look are fingerprint magnets. In addition, the chamfered edges dig into your hands after prolonged usage. I must also add, the three navigation key at the bottom don’t light up.. While the build quality can still be considered decent, here onwards everything goes downhill for the Neo 5. which makes the phone easy to hold, has a resolution of only 480 x 854 pixels. This resolution is lower than almost anything at its price, since most of its counterparts have an HD display at least. Moreover, it is quite reflective as well. In normal usage, under the sun, I saw myself instead of the display, which was quite annoying when receiving calls or trying to text. Adding to this, the viewing angles and colour saturation of the display is average and I expected better from the company. Oppo has used better displays in many of its other phones.. As for the UI, the phone is running Color OS on top of Android Kitkat. First of all, Oppo's choice to stay on Kitkat is a definite step back, given that almost every other manufacturer is providing Lollipop-powered devices. Coming back to the UI, it works and runs smoothly. There are plenty of good looking apps and icons, like the music app, but the UI feels a bit overdone at few places. For example, the Settings menu is divided into three different tabs. The animations across the UI take unnecessary time. Oppo could have made them faster but instead they perform in a rather slowly. Also, the lack of app drawer will be a deal breaker for some. The UI also becomes an issue in some other cases, which I will describe later.. Like I said earlier, the UI on the phone runs smoothly and I felt no lag while navigating through it. Day-to-day performance is okay but there are occasional stutters. As for the hardcore gaming part, while the phone is not that powerful on paper, it is able to handle simple games like Temple Run, Subway Surfer etc.. 9,990, phones like Yu Yureka Plus or the Honor 4C offer much better experience. Treading through the synthetic benchmarks, the phone does come out to be outmatched when compared to the competition.. Oppo Neo 5 Benchmarks | Create infographics. As for the call quality, I found it to be okay. On the other hand, music playback via the loudspeaker or headphones felt unsatisfactory. The phone is not loud enough and won’t be able to please even the non-audiophile. It's actually even worse than the Honor 6, with Huawei's known volume issues.. With below average performance so far, I wasn't expecting a stellar battery life and I wasn't surprised. In our normal battery test where we run a 1080p file on loop, the 1900 mAh battery lasts 6.5 hours. Using the phone as a daily driver I found the battery lasted about 12 hours at best,. on a normal working day, which included bunch of calls, half an hour gaming, some photography moments and hour of video streaming via YouTube.. The camera is a greater disappointment though. The 8MP camera at the rear, overexposes images and leaves too much visible noise in pictures. Images taken, lack colour accuracy and have a less than average dynamic range. Low light images were equally poor and had too much noise. The flash is overpowering and ruins the images when used. The video camera is average and the front-facing camera looks like a VGA cam.. The Oppo Neo 5 is not a good phone to buy. There are plenty of options under the sub-10K price point, which offer almost twice the performance in every aspect. Compared to the Oppo Neo 5, even the Moto G (1st Gen) would be a good buy, while the newer,. phones like the Yu Yureka Plus, Lenovo K3 Note or the Honor 4C. In fact, if this is the performance you want, then save some money and buy the Xiaomi Redmi 2 or Lenovo A6000 Plus.. Oppo Neo 5 Dual Sim 16 GB.... 10.or E (Beyond Black, 3 GB).

The operating system of Neo 5 cool.....but its not the perfect mobile for online game.....i play 2 simple game(Township, 29 card) & the display is going to black......about 30% has gone already.....so be careful about to buy the Neo 5....... I used to have an OPPO really nice for selfies my friends borrow it just to get a selfie, but I lost it so sad someone got interested and took it. I'm playing pokemon go with this device but since it's just 2000mah it drains fast so this is not for hardcore gaming.. Oppo Neo 5 (2015) do not support 4G , Oppo Neo 5S supprot 4g.

Anonymous, 09 Oct 2016 The phone is dual but it uses very tiny micro SIM which you can easily get from safaricom shop... more does this phone uses 2 sims simultaneously?. I am honestly impressed with the unit's display, given its only qHD, its bright enough and has above average viewing angles. having a low res display wont put too much toll on its battery as well. The handset's BUILD is also one of the factors, its tough and dureable, the back plate is fingerprint-magnet but I had purchased a case for it so its not gonna be an issue. The BATTERY has been splendid, batt reading will not drop on my 8-hr sleep unlike previous mobile devices I used. When on mobile data, I have observed a 1% drop only every 4mins. AUDIO output via loudspeaker is bit of a letdown, a bit soft to my liking, but when used with a headphone, the HI-DIRAC option helps to increase audio quality. It has a kick of bass and treble and mids are both clean. I have Vivo Y51, Acer Z630, Zenfone Go 5.5 and Oppo Neo 7 all on my list as they all have a 5990 Php SRP hence I got to save 1k Php more with my purchase of the Neo 5... no regrets, its very useable and the looks alone of the phone is indeed very elegant and stylish!. oppo neo 5, 07 Oct 2016 Oppo is the very good mobile company. we have a oppo neo 5 mobile and i brought on 3 october 2... more Brow i have this phone since 11 july (my birthdat) and its very well phone.
