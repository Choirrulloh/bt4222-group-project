The Xiaomi Mi 4C looks on paper (and in the flesh) to be a fantastic device, half the price of the similarly specced. with performance that can be just as fast. But 'can be' is the key point here, as overheating issues plagued our review sample during our benchmarks. We'll talk more about this in the H ardware &. performance section of this review.. We also had issues with some less-than-user-friendly preinstalled software, although these were easily rectified as we'll discuss in the Software section. Also see: Best Android phones 2015/2016 .. The Xiaomi Mi 4C is available in two versions: the standard model with 16GB of storage and 2GB of RAM, as reviewed here; and a 32GB of storage, 3GB of RAM 'Advanced' version that should offer improved performance.. Xiaomi doesn't officially sell its phones in the UK, so if you want to get hold of one you'll need to buy it from a Chinese website that will ship to the UK.. However, be warned that if you are shipping this phone to the UK from China you may also have to pay import duty - read our advice on buying grey-market tech .. Our standard Xiaomi Mi 4C was supplied by Geekbuying , which charges £159.20 at the time of writing with free shipping to the UK.. This version has a very closely matched spec to the 16GB Nexus 5X , which is available in the UK for £339 - more than double the price of the Xiaomi Mi 4C. Check out our review of the Nexus 5X .. Geekbuying also sells the Mi 4C Advanced for £180.41 at the time of writing. If we were a paying customer we'd be inclined to opt for this version, given the small difference in price, the expected improved performance and the fact that there's no possibility of expanding storage via microSD in either model. (There are other ways to add storage to Android , of course.). For a £150 phone made of plastic (albeit with a metal inner frame for enhanced rigidity and durability) the Xiaomi Mi 4C is actually really quite good-looking. thin slab just 7.8mm thick, it has. a soft-touch coating that feels great in the hand. There's no creaking or flexing - this phone feels very well made.. The screen-to-body ratio is high, with some pretty slim bezels. For a phone that has a 5in screen the Mi 4C is extremely well proportioned, just 138.1x69.9mm. It's also lightweight, at 132g, without feeling like a toy. Also see: Best budget phones 2015/2016 .. If you're thinking the Xiaomi Mi 4C looks familiar, that's because it's identical to the Mi 4i. In fact, it is pretty much the Mi 4i with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 chip inside and the addition of a futureproof USB-C port for data transfer and charging. Also see: Best MiFi 2016 .. Available in black, white, pink, blue or yellow the Xiaomi Mi 4C can be elegant or fun in its appearance. The rear cover is not removable, though, so be sure which model you want before you buy. You'll find buttons and connectors in all the usual places, with a metal-effect volume rocker and power button high up on the right edge, a 3.5mm headphone jack and IR blaster at the top, a dual-SIM tray that pops out from the left edge and a USB-C port on the bottom. Turn over the phone and there's a 13Mp camera with two-tone flash in the upper left corner, and a speaker grille that is slightly raised off. the surface of a desk by a small plastic protrusion to help prevent the sound being muffled.. The screen is a plus point, with a 5in full-HD (1920x1080 pixels) IPS panel with a sharp pixel density of 441ppi. Contrast is excellent, though the screen could be brighter - we found ourselves using it at maximum brightness at all times.. That said, this is a 'Sunlight display' that is claimed to be much easier to view in all conditions. We weren't blessed with any sunshine at the time of our review, but we certainly didn't have any problems reading the screen outdoors.. slight quibble with the screen is that we're not convinced it will fend off accidental scratching too well. It's rather keen on fingerprints, too. Also see all Android phone reviews .. The Xiaomi Mi 4C has the same core hardware as the Nexus 5X, with a 1.8GHz hexa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 64-bit chip, Adreno 418 graphics and 2GB of LPDDR3 RAM (3GB in the 32GB Advanced model). Both feature full-HD IPS screens, although the Nexus' is slightly larger at 5.2in against the Xiaomi's 5in. On paper, performance should be very closely matched.. And it is - when the Xiaomi Mi 4C is cold. (You can compare the Xiaomi Mi 4C's performance to other Android phones we've recently tested in our article What's the fastest smartphone? ). When we first tried to run our usual benchmarks they were plagued with pop-up adverts from various preinstalled apps. This isn't a problem with the Xiaomi MIUI 7 operating system itself, rather the version of the software that was preinstalled before the phone was shipped to us. Having rectified this issue (we'll explain how in the Software section) we were able to install our benchmarking apps and run them without interruption. AnTuTu had to be sideloaded, but it ran fine.. On our second attempt we found very good performance that is right up there with the Nexus 5X. In Geekbench 3, for example, we measured 1251 points. in the single-core component and 3233. By comparison, the Nexus 5X scored 1240 single-core and 3528 multi-core. But each time we ran Geekbench 3 the Mi 4C began to heat up and our results very quickly fell off a cliff - to the extent that we were unable to get higher than 650 points single-core and 2027 multi-core. See all smartphone reviews .. We also ran AnTuTu on the Xiaomi Mi 4C from cold and recorded a very good 54,250 score. When the phone began getting warm this dropped to 44,818 points.. We saw the same results in every benchmark we ran. In SunSpider (using Google Chrome) we recorded 496ms. cold, which is incredibly good, but. 1369ms warm (lower is better in this test). We also ran the intensive GFXBench graphics test. The 5X completed this test with results of 16fps in Manhattan and 38fps in T-Rex. Despite housing the same processor and graphics chip the Xiaomi Mi 4C could handle only 15fps in Manhattan and 34fps in T-Rex. As it became warm, this dropped to 11fps in Manhattan and 23fps in T-Rex.. These aren't small differences we're talking about here. It's important to point out that. the Xiaomi Mi 4C feels fast and responsive in real-world use, but our benchmark results show how performance can rapidly deteriorate as you use the phone.. It's also worth pointing out that the Advanced Mi 4C. should be faster with its extra gig of RAM, but we can't promise that it won't suffer the same overheating issues. The Advanced version does, however, offer an extra 16GB of storage, which will likely prove useful given that the preinstalled software takes up a huge chunk of that available (just over 10GB is available to the user) and the fact there's no microSD slot.. It's not all doom and gloom. when it comes to performance, though. Despite its dinky shell the Xiaomi Mi 4C is fitted with a generous 3080mAh battery that supports Quick Charge over USB-C (and is supplied with a compatible charger). It may not be removable, but you should get two days of use out of this Android phone (slightly less if you take advantage of the Xiaomi's. The Xiaomi Mi 4C can accept two Micro-SIM cards. It's a dual-standby model, although both SIM slots can support 4G. Unlike some other Chinese dual-SIM phones we've seen, you cannot use the second SIM slot to insert a microSD card. Also see: Best dual-SIM phones 2015/2016 .. When buying a phone from abroad you should always check the frequency bands it offers to ensure that it will be compatible for your home network. Those in the UK should note that this Xiaomi Mi 4C does not support the 800MHz LTE band, which means O2 customers (and customers of operators. that use O2's network, such as GiffGaff) will not be able to use. The 1800MHz and 2600MHz 4G LTE bands are both covered. Also see: How to check whether a phone is supported by your network .. A standout feature here is the IR blaster, which we're seeing in fewer flagships these days. The Mi 4C also supports 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS and GLONASS, OTG and Miracast. NFC is not supported, and neither is there a fingerprint scanner, but there is a reversible USB-C data transfer and charging port, which we should see in more and more Android phones throughout 2016. Also see: Best Chinese phones 2015/2016 .. The Xiaomi Mi 4C is fitted with a 13Mp Sony IMX 258 camera with phase-detection autofocus and a two-tone flash at the rear, and a 5Mp front camera. You can switch between the two cameras with a swipe up or down on the screen.. The selfie camera on the whole works very well. However, we noticed in our testing that it will try to work out how old you look in the shot. And it had some difficulty in deciding whether it was looking at a 25-year-old female or a 50-year-old male. One I would take as a compliment, and the other a little rude.. Real-time filter previews are accessible with a swipe in from the right side of the screen. Swipe in from the left to access all the usual shooting modes including HDR, Panorama, Fish eye, Tilt-shift and Beautify (note that these aren't available for the selfie camera). In Manual mode you can control the white balance, focus, exposure time and ISO. Also see: Best phone camera 2015/2016 .. Our test shots from the Xiaomi Mi 4C were reasonably good, full of detail and with great colours. HDR improves things, and we'd recommend leaving it on all the time. You can see a couple of our test shots below.. Here's a 100 percent crop of the photo above: detail is a soft in places, but we couldn't work out if it was post-processing causing the issue, or the lens.. Edge Tap lets you tap the left side of the device (the top when held sideways) set the focus, and a second tap triggers the shutter. However, this is bad idea: you're shaking the camera and there doesn't appear to be any image stabilisation to compensate (not that we can fault the Mi 4c at this price). Here's what happens when you tap - even lightly - to take a photo. Parts are in focus, while other parts are blurred. Look at the clock tower, too - it's wonky.. Macro shots show the camera is capable of some great-looking photos:. The 100 percent crop below shows it can't resolve fine detail like the Nexus 5X can:. Colours are saturated making greens in particular look great:. Again, zoom in 1:1 and detail is soft:. The Xiaomi Mi 4C runs the MIUI 7 operating system, which is based on Android 5.1 Lollipop. Out of the box we had an awful first impression of MIUI 7.. Before the phone was shipped to us an. unofficial version of MIUI 7 had been preinstalled (with the version. We expect this is because out of the box Xiaomi phones don't run Google apps, including the Google Play store. (Xiaomi phones do have their own app store preinstalled, but language is a barrier here for UK users.). It's worth pointing out that it isn't only Geekbuying that preinstalls this version of the OS, and it's very likely that if you've had a Xiaomi phone shipped from China it will be running this version of the OS. Unfortunately, it's nothing like proper MIUI 7, and is plagued with third-party apps that pop up when you really don't need them to and all manner of adverts, including on the lock screen.. The good news is its really easy to install the official version of MIUI 7 and then sideload Google apps. and download the latest stable ROM to your PC or Mac.. Plug your Xiaomi Mi 4C into your computer using the USB-C cable. Open a file manager window to browse its contents and drop the downloaded file on to its internal storage.. Now open the Settings menu on your phone and scroll down to About phone. At the bottom of the screen you'll see a System updates option; tap this.. Tap the three dots at the top right of the screen and select 'Choose update package'. Browse to the downloaded file on your phone and follow the instructions to install it.. some of the features that had previously been preinstalled were still present, so we performed a factory reset (Settings, Additional Settings, Backup & reset, Factory data reset, enable Erase stored content, Reset phone). This will wipe the Google apps from the phone, but it's easy to get them back.. Back on your PC or Mac download the Google Installer apk from http://en.miui.com/thread-3998-1-1.html. As before, plug the Mi 4C into your computer, open a file browser and drop the downloaded file into the Downloads folder.. On the phone you should now open the File Explorer app (which is in the Tools folder on the home screen). You should see the downloaded apk file at the top of your recent activity, or you can look within the Downloads folder. It's a third-party app so MIUI 7 will warn you about installing such things - wait for it to count down from 10 and you can then click 'Allow once'.. Once installed you'll see a list of Google apps you can install, including the Play Store. You will likely find it will prompt you to download and install the Google Services Framework before you can install the Play Store, so accept this installation when prompted.. Following our installation of the Play Store we found some apps within the store were reported as not being compatible with our device - AnTuTu was one of them. However, it's very easy to search online for their apk file and then install it to the Mi 4C in exactly the same way you just installed the Google Installer apk.. Having set up our Xiaomi Mi 4C with MIUI 7 as it was intended (albeit with the addition of Google apps, given that you are intended to sign in with your Mi account rather than your Google account), our experience with the phone was infinitely better, and we did begin to see what the fuss is all about with Xiaomi phones. However, it has to be said there is an awful lot of preinstalled software on this device - with Xiaomi's own apps for just about everything you can think of, including the aforementioned Chinese app store and its own virus scanner, just 10GB was available to the user.. It is a nice UI, though, with plenty of customisations. In common with iOS there's no app tray, which means everything is visible on the home screen. It's easy to group apps into folders by dragging and dropping them on top of each other, though.. A pinch on the home screen brings up options to move apps, add widgets and alter the wallpaper and effects (the transitions as you move between home. A selection of Themes are also available from the Settings menu.. Pull down from the top of the screen and rather than your quick settings (these are available with a swipe from the right) you'll find recent notifications.. We like the idea of the Xiaomi Mi 4C's Edge tap feature, which lets you go back a screen with a tap on the device's left edge, or take a photo with a double-tap of the device's left edge when the camera app is open. However, it seems an odd thing to want to do to knock the phone as you're about to take a photo (most people would want to hold it steady), and the tap to go back feature seemed to be a little laggy at times.. notable addition to MIUI 7 is. a one-handed mode, which can shrink the phone's display down to either 3.5- or 4in to make it easier to use in a single. This works on either the left or right side of the screen, suiting both lefties and righties, although we found it quite difficult to turn on. (you must tap the home button and swipe to either the left or right depending on which side you want to use the screen).. We also like the Child mode, which lets you allow access only to certain apps installed on your phone before handing it over to the kids.. Read next: Best new phones coming in 2016.

On paper the Xiaomi Mi 4C is an excellent mid-range Android phone, with a fantastic spec for the money - it's half the price of the Nexus 5X and can be just as fast. There's a generous battery, a fairly good camera and some interesting new features such as USB-C. However, our benchmarking showed overheating to be a problem, and the issues we experienced with software out of the box make it difficult to recommend to less techie users..

Xiaomi Mi 4, one of the hottest Chinese-bred flagships of 2014, got two modifications over the course of its lifecycle - that's an achievement right there. The Mi 4i was more of an attractive mid-ranger rather than a Mi 4 spiritual successor, but the Mi 4c is what we call a flagship in disguise and a true successor of the Mi 4.. Xiaomi is supposed to announce the anticipated Mi 5 in just few weeks, but yet it surprised its loyal fans with a device so good that it's almost impossible to resist. The Xiaomi Mi 4c looks absolutely the same as the Mi 4i. And this is where the ordinary talk ends.. The new Mi 4c is widely advertised because of the Fast Charging-enabled USB Type-C port. In fact, Xiaomi thought this was a major enough upgrade to add the letter 'c' in the name. But there is more about the Mi 4c than that. Take the powerful Snapdragon 808 chip for example. It's the one to power LG's latest creations - the top of the shelf G4 and V10, and Xiaomi is shipping this flagship-grade hardware at half the G4 asking price.. The camera got upgraded too - it is now capable of higher resolution panoramic images and higher resolution slow-mo videos. And there is the refreshed and stylish MIUI v7 coming right out of the box.. Sure, we can blame Xiaomi for reusing the same design over and over again, but if we have to be honest - we like it and we can let Xiaomi get away with it. We can live with the understated polycarbonate finish for yet another year because of the great pricing and even greater feature set.. The lack of a memory expansion slot and a removable battery is something the Mi followers expected, since it is becoming a trend even with the major Chinese's brands. At least Xiaomi is dedicated on providing 32GB models or more for its smartphones.. Just like the Xiaomi Mi 4i, the Mi 4c isn't meant to be a low-cost version of the Mi 4 original, but rather an alternative option. And this time around it sure won't be remembered as such - the Mi 4c is more powerful, better connected, with richer imagining skills and a personality of its own..

Xiaomi Mi4c review: the half-price Nexus 5X. The Xiaomi Mi4c is now available, with. specs sheet that's very much like the Nexus 5X 's, at half the price. I spent a few days getting to know the Mi4C, putting it through its paces and seeing how it compares to devices that cost double or triple the price. Find out how it performed in our full Xiaomi Mi4c review.. ✓ Infrared to control the TV. ✕ No Google Play Store (but it can be added). ✕ Not officially available in the US. Xiaomi Mi 4c release date and price. Buy now: Xiaomi Mi 4c from Xiaomi from US$205. The Xiaomi Mi 4c costs less than US$250, but offers specs similar to the Nexus 5X. The Xiaomi Mi4c release date was September 22 in China. At the time of writing, the Xiaomi Mi4c is available through several retailers across China and Europe. Although it is not officially being released in the US or UK, you can pick it. up through various import sites (Xiaomi sells its devices unlocked). As always, just check the LTE bands and so on to ensure it is compatible with your carrier.. The Xiaomi Mi4c price will vary depending on which of the two models you opt for and the retailer you buy it from. In China, the 16 GB version with 2 GB of RAM goes for 1,299 Yuan, and the 32 GB version, with 3 GB of RAM, for 1,499 Yuan. That's the equivalent of around US$205 / £135 and US$235 / £155 respectively.. The Xiaomi Mi4c is available in several color options, including black, white, yellow, blue and pink. It ships with an USB Type-C charging cable. We got the European version, which came with a US adapter and a European extension.. Xiaomi Mi 4c design and build quality. You might not expect to find an IR blaster on a phone at this price, but there it is. The Xiaomi Mi 4c has a dual micro-SIM card tray, but no microSD card expansion. The right-hand side has a power button and volume rocker, which can be used to shoot photos. distinct sense of déjà vu when you see the Mi4c. It looks an awful lot like every other. Xiaomi phone of recent times, which, in turn, take. design cues from several other sources, most notably the iPhone 5c. Is a boring design acceptable on a phone that's this cheap though? Absolutely.. The Xiaomi Mi4c may look tame, but inside it's a beast. As mentioned above, it has a very similar (if not better) specs sheet to. the newly released Nexus 5X, and that phone costs twice as much. The Mi4c won't come with any Google apps (including the Play Store), but you can install them yourself easily enough.. The Xiaomi Mi4c has a fully plastic exterior with a non-removable back cover. change the battery or add a microSD card slot. While the slightly curved edges of the phone are comfortable in the hand, it is a very slippery phone. If you're at all clumsy you're going to want to invest in a non-slip cover or bumper case.. It measures 138.1 x 69.6 x 7.8 mm, which is basically. identical to the original Nexus 5 , but a little thinner. The upper edge features an infrared blaster alongside the headphone port, and the bottom edge has a centrally located USB Type-C charging port and a pinhole mic. The left-hand side has a pop-out tray for dual micro-SIM cards and the right-hand side has the power and volume buttons.. The speaker is located at the bottom of the back of the. the Sony Xperia range, the camera lens and two-tone LED flash are pushed right up into the corner of the back of the phone, and a tiny pinhole mic next to the camera lens picks up audio for video. the Mi4c is nice and light and its plastic construction means it should. be reasonably shock absorbent if dropped.. The Xiaomi Mi4c is a great looking phone. The build quality is top notch for a phone in this price range and the inclusion of. an IR blaster, LED notification light and FM radio shows. that Xiaomi has no interest in cutting corners in order to keep the price down.. The Xiaomi Mi 4c has a nice, bright and accurate 5-inch IPS LCD display. The left side has the SIM tray and can also be tapped to perform gesture controls. You'd probably expect to find an HD display on a phone around the US$200 mark. Not so with the Mi4c, which comes with a 5-inch Full HD display. It's not just a Full HD screen though, it's a really good Full HD screen.. The colors are very realistic, it's very vibrant, and the contrast is well managed and well balanced. The IPS LCD is clearly visible outdoors, even under direct sunlight.. Xiaomi has delivered extremely good results at a low price point.. a pixel density of 441 ppi, the Mi4c is right in the middle of the pack when it comes to image sharpness but ahead of the rest of the Full HD pack in terms of the. The viewing angles are great, the image is stunning and touch responsiveness is top notch.. The Xiaomi Mi 4c has a USB Type-C connector, but the included cable is a reconfigured USB 2.0 cable. Fast charging, dual-SIM support and infrared sensors are hardly unique selling points these days, and the Xiaomi Mi4c has all three of these. in one hour using Qualcomm's Quick Charge 2.0 standard. USB Type C is the biggest differentiator in the Mi4c arsenal.. The included USB Type-C cable is like the one shipped with the OnePlus 2 though: a reconfigured USB 2.0 cable rather than a true. This means you won't enjoy faster data transfer speeds straight out of the box, just the convenience of having a reversible charging cable. You'll need buy a real Type-C cable. to enjoy all the benefits of this new USB standard.. The Xiaomi Mi 4c runs MIUI 7 on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. The interface might not be to everyone's liking, but the speed of the Xiaomi Mi 4c will be. Despite its low price, the Xiaomi Mi 4c has plenty of cool software features. Audio settings, LED notification options and battery saving options round out the Mi 4c. The Mi4c software is Xiaomi's own MIUI 7 interface running on top of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. that the Google Play Store and suite of standard Google apps is not pre-installed on this phone. There's nothing stopping you from installing them though, so don't let that deter you if are thinking about importing this phone,. a really good buy (as long as it will work with your carrier bands).. MIUI may not be the best-looking manufacturer skin around but it's not the worst either. Xiaomi puts theming front and center, so you can switch the look of things very easily. If you don't like the way MIUI is set up you can quickly and easily substitute it for an alternative launcher such as the Google Now Launcher to get a more familiar Android experience on your Mi4c.. Fans of MIUI will find the latest version very nice indeed. Not only is everything nice and flat, but the speed and fluidity of the interface is remarkable. The Mi4c runs faster than many phones that cost double the price. It's easy to change the way a phone looks, but making it faster is harder. Xiaomi certainly got the speed of the Mi4c right.. Over time, MIUI has matured to sit comfortably alongside its competition, offering nifty features such as. the left side of the phone (not the screen) with your thumb to go back. Doing the same in the camera app will. the on-screen shutter button or the volume button).. In addition to providing all the basic functions of Android, Xiaomi has done a lot where customization is concerned.. But what it all boils down to is how fluid and responsive the interface is, regardless of which launcher you use. Xiaomi has once again proven it knows how to build fast phones, even on a very tight budget. I couldn't say the Mi4c is as fast as a Nexus 5 on Android Marshmallow , but it's not too far off. It's definitely punching above its weight though.. The Xiaomi Mi 4c might not be as fast as a Nexus 5 on Marshmallow, but it's not far off. You saw that right, the Xiaomi Mi 4c benchmarks higher than the Nexus 6 in AnTuTu. The Xiaomi Mi 4c also scores well in Geekbench 3. In Qualcomm's Vellamo benchmark test, the Xiaomi Mi 4c hovers around the LG G4 scores. It consistently posts mid-50K results in AnTuTu, and gives. solid results in Geekbench as well. The Xiaomi Mi4c specs include the Snapdragon 808 CPU, the processor of choice in 2015 for all those manufacturers trying to avoid the issues of the Snapdragon 810.. The Snapdragon 808 is a hexa-core processor that has also appeared in the LG G4 , Moto X Pure Edition. It has four cores clocked at 1.4 GHz and two high-performance cores clocked at 1.82 GHz. It may not be the fastest processor available right now, but to find the same CPU in a US$200 phone as found in high-end flagships is a very rare thing indeed.. The two versions of the Mi4c (16 GB and 32 GB) offer different amounts of RAM. and the larger storage option provides 3 GB. Considering the minor price difference (around US$30. ), you may as well opt for more storage and RAM. (Just to be clear, the version we're testing here. is the 16 GB, 2 GB model.). Considering how solidly the 808 performs with 2 GB of RAM, we can only expect even better multi-tasking and app switching from the 3 GB version. Pushing pixels around a 5-inch Full HD display doesn't tax the processor that much and the battery benefits as a result too.. Looking beyond basic speed and responsiveness, the Xiaomi Mi4c performs well in other areas too. Wi-Fi connectivity is very stable and fast, connecting to LTE where you'd expect it to and providing reliable download speeds. The inclusion of a dual SIM card tray. is a bonus for those juggling multiple SIMs.. The rear-mounted speaker is about the only weak point on the Xiaomi Mi 4c. We experienced some crackling during phone calls but that is more likely to be caused by mismatched carrier frequencies than a hardware problem. Subsequent calls performed better (when cellular reception was at full strength) and audio quality was good. Again: we remind you to check your carrier's bands against the Mi4c before buying one.. you can't expect the Mi4c to live up to US$700 phones in all areas, and the speaker is one area where it falls short.. The speaker's positioning, on the back of the Mi4c, means it's. easy to muffle with a finger and the sound quality is not up to scratch, especially at higher volumes. It's much the same as most other tinny smartphone speakers – but don't expect anything too impressive.. The 13 MP main camera on the Xiaomi Mi 4c produces top-notch results. Outside in the sunlight the Xiaomi Mi 4c camera performs nicely. Inside, under fluorescent lighting, the Mi 4c is still capable of capturing plenty of detail and color. The balance between orange and blue here is impressive, and the colors are very true to life. Skin tones are mildly smoothed out in selfies but the results are solid. The Mi4c main camera shoots at 13 MP. and the front-facing camera shoots at 5 MP. That's not bad for a cheap phone. But resolution isn't everything, as we've discovered time and time again with other devices. Software makes all the difference, so how does the Mi4c compare?. I wouldn't go quite so far as to say the Mi4c produces comparable results to high-end smartphones like the LG G4 and Galaxy S6 , but it's close, and it blows other mid-range phones out of the water.. Xiaomi uses two different sensors interchangeably in the Mi4c, a Sony sensor (IMX258) and a Samsung (S5K3M2). Both are good but the Sony sensor will provide slightly more detailed and sharp images. More importantly, the Mi4c auto-focus speed is less than 0.1 second. Take a look at these sample photos and judge for yourself.. It doesn't take much effort to get more than a day's worth of battery out of the Xiaomi Mi 4c. So, Xiaomi got performance and camera right, but how about the battery? Once again the Mi4c outperforms its price point. With a 3,080 mAh battery the Mi4c looks good on paper, but the software and hardware optimization are also up to the task, and the Mi4c easily delivers a full day of. If you're not as heavy a user as us. here at AndroidPIT, you can likely drag that battery life out to two days.. We're pleased by not surprised by this; a. low-resolution display combined with a high-end processor and. a good-sized battery is always going to produce good results (a fact we wish other manufacturers would learn, especially those that keep shrinking battery capacities in their latest phones).. The Mi4c is also the first USB Type-C device to support Qualcomm's Quick Charge 2.0 standard, providing faster charging speeds than the OnePlus 2 for example.. 138.1 x 69.6 x 7.8 mm. 1920 x 1080 pixels (441 ppi). You might not expect to get. in a device that costs less than US$250. Xiaomi Mi4c on account of its price, because you. would be missing out on one of the best budget phones of the year. With a specs sheet equivalent to many flagship phones that cost two or three times as much, the Mi4c delivers incredible performance at an unheard-of price.. many ways: solid hardware, great performance, good camera and battery and a rock bottom price. Sure, the speakers aren't great and there's no microSD expansion, but you can't have everything. For this price you'd be hard-pressed to find anything better.. The biggest problem is group texting. When a friend includes me in a group texting, I will only see his name as if it's a direct text and not group text (where I can see other people included in the group). Then when other people in the group replied, I will see their text as individual text to me. Obviously, when I replied to the individual text, then it's a direct text reply and not to the whole group. There is no problem when I create a group text though since I can see the people in the group. It's only when somebody created a group text and I'm included. Lately, I noticed that some individual text is not being received. Is this problem here in New York City, witt ATT, using this mi4c?. Actually, for the price, Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 will be better and slightly cheaper. - it's got most everything and in addition replaceable battery and SD card. Just got my hands on a Mi4c from the official website. Picture quality is terrible, no idea where you got that good mark from. While it yields fast and acceptable results when you hold the phone still with both hands, it is absolutely shit when you just snap a shot from the wrist. And to think that even the Nexus 5 would shoot decent snaps when you were riding a bicycle. Also lots of noise in low-resolution circumstances. Phone to be avoided if camera is important to you.. did you try it indoors, with fluorescent light, and shot holding the camera with one hand? Can you post some pictures?. Solid device with bang for your buck. Any advice how to check if this will work on my USA carrier (T-mobile).. GSM / HSPA / LTE 2G bands. GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 - SIM 1 & SIM 2 3G bands.

Xiaomi Mi 4c With USB Type-C, Snapdragon 808 SoC Launched. Ketan Pratap , 22 September 2015. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Xiaomi, as promised, launched its Mi 4c smartphone at an event in China.. As expected, the Xiaomi Mi 4c has been launched in two variants: 2GB of RAM and 16GB storage priced at CNY 1,299 (approximately Rs. 13,500), and 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage priced at CNY 1499 (approximately Rs. The Xiaomi Mi 4c will be going on sale starting Wednesday in China and is expected to arrive in other Asian countries, including India, soon. ( Update : A Xiaomi representative has said the smartphone is China only, which will disappoint our readers in India.). The new Mi 4c supports USB Type-C reversible connector, a highlight of the device. The company has introduced a USB Type-C Adapter which will be available via the company's online store (Mi.com) at CNY 5 (approximately Rs. The smartphone also comes with Edge Tap technology, which Xiaomi claimed it's their patented technology, which allows the handset to perform different assigned functions with a single tap and double tap on the edges of the handset.. According to the company, the Edge Tap technology on the Mi 4c will allow the handset to click an image with just one tap on the edge while double tap will take the user back to previous page. The function can be extremely useful while clicking a quick image without reaching out for the screen. It runs MIUI 6, and is slated to receive MIUI 7 update in the coming months.. The Xiaomi Mi 4c features a 5-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) display, similar to the Xiaomi Mi 4i. The company touts that the handset features a Sunlight display, which means it can be easy to read on the screen of the Mi 4c under the Sun and also comes with night reading mode. The Mi 4c supports Double Tap feature, which wakes up the screen on double tap.. Under the hood, the Xiaomi Mi 4c is powered by a 64-bit hexa-core Snapdragon 808 processor clocked at 1.8GHz. The handset sports a 13-megapixel rear camera, just like Mi 4i. The rear camera features phase detection autofocus and comes with Sony IMX258 or Samsung S5K3M2 sensor. The handset also features a 5-megapixel front-facing camera that comes with 85-degree wide angle lens and self-timer. The company at the launch compared the front-camera samples of the Mi 4c against the iPhone 6 .. The dual 4G SIM-based Mi 4c is backed by 3080mAh battery. The company confirmed that the smartphone supports Quick Charge 2.0. The handset comes with Infrared that helps the handset to act as a remote for various electronic appliances. It measures 138.1x69.6x7.8mm and weighs 132 grams. It will be available in Black, Blue, Orange, Pink, and White colours..

Estaba pensando cambiar de celular, y este Mi4C era una de las opciones que más me atraía. Sin embargo, buscando información acerca del mismo encontré con que la batería dura, en promedio, unas horas menos que mi actual Moto E 1ra Gen., y eso me está echando un poco atrás con respecto a qué celular elegir. Alguno que ya lo tenga podría decirme si en verdad la batería es tan mala como las especificaciones dicen? O esto es solo en papel, y al usarlo uno puede llegar a conseguir unas cuantas horas más? Muchas gracias de antemano!! :blush:. 7 Respuestas 753 vistas. Pues lo que pongo en el titulo ¿tiene radio FM? Muchas gracias!. 2 Respuestas 2203 vistas. Quería saber si la banda de frecuencias es valida para la cobertura nacional de España de 4G y 3G. También saber sobre la batería si al final es de polimeros o li-ion. Por último saber si se actualizará este terminal a android 6.0 y más o menos cuando. No se garantiza la información de este sitio web.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery and Conclusion. posted by Paul K.. 4 Call Quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction By now, you've probably heard of Xiaomi – the Chinese company, which is in the habit of selling smartphones with some pretty powerful hardware at unbelievably low prices — in eastern Asia, at least. Indeed, trying to get your hands on one of these handsets will usually involve some extra shipping fees and taxes, but even after that, the phones still end up offering some extra value for the money spent. Earlier this year, the company launched an “affordable flagship” in India – the Xiaomi Mi 4i – which, as always, packed some pretty respectable hardware for its asking price. Later, in September, Xiaomi launched the Mi 4c in China – very similar in appearance to the 4i, and still bearing a bargain price-tag, but with a more powerful processor inside. That managed to peak the interest of Android smartphone fans who follow the more exotic handsets closely. You can't buy the Mi 4c directly from Xiaomi, but there are a lot of 3rd party websites that sell it worldwide. The base model comes with a hexa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808, 2 GB of RAM, a 13 MP / 5 MP camera combo, and a 3,080 mAh battery, all for the price of around $240, minus shipping and taxes. The offer sounds quite enticing, and we were quite anxious to see whether it is as good as it sounds. In the box: Xiaomi Mi 4c Quick start guide (in Chinese) SIM ejector tool Wall charger USB Type-C data cable Design Plastic elegance Being a $240 handset , we can't fault the Mi 4c for not being made out of shiny materials. The phone 's body pretty much consists of a glass front and a plastic back panel, which wraps around to its sides. It's a solid build that doesn't creek, crack, or move around when pressured. It does, however, strike us with an elegant and ergonomic design. The back is slightly arched, making it comfortable to hold, while its corners are stark, giving it a very sleek look, but without being sharp to the touch. The plastic is of the matte variety; it has a soft feel when held, but it does attract quite a bit of fingerprint smudges. On the front, we have the small-ish earpiece grille, which manages to complement the handset's elegant looks. To the right of it, there's the selfie cam and a notification LED. Below the display, we have a trio of capacitive navigational keys, which are invisible when the backlighting is off. The phone's hardware controls are situated on its right side – a power button sits just north from the phone's center, and the volume rocker is placed above it. The power key is decently clicky, but the rocker feels a tad shallow. It doesn't help that the latter is quite wobbly, too, generally causing us to feel uncomfortable while using it. On the top of the device , we have the 3.5 mm headphone jack and an IR blaster. On the bottom, there is the USB Type-C charging and data port. The speaker grille is a wide strip, situated in the bottom center of the handset's back. The camera is in the top-left corner, accompanied by a dual-tone LED. In terms of handling, the phone is pretty easy to operate, with its ergonomic design and average-sized display. It also fits well in pockets and is light enough to not cause any issues. Display Colors that pop The Xiaomi Mi 4c is equipped with a 5-inch IPS LCD display with a 1080 x 1920 pixel resolution. Its pixel-per-inch density lands at 441, which makes the screen pretty sharp. Color temperature measures at 7,844 K, which is quite off from the reference value of 6,500 K. As a result, the display has a bluish — at times leaning towards purple — tint. For the night readers who worry about the blue colors – there is a "reading mode" in the settings, which allows the user to choose how much they wish to warm up the screen via a slider; it goes from regular cold-ish picture to full-on red. Color reproduction is also far from perfect, as the Mi 4c's display manages to miss almost all of the targets on the sRGB scale, and most of the colors are often over-saturated. All that being said, we didn't find the display to be bad. Yes, some colors do blow up, but we didn't feel them to be as aggressive to our sight as the measurements might suggest. The images look vivid and alive, and we appreciated that. The purple tint of the display was most evident in dark environments, where we did find it kind of annoying. The display's maximum brightness measures at 456 nits and we found it pretty usable out in broad daylight. The lowest it would go is 1 nit, which is excellent for night-time usage. We do wish that Xiaomi had gotten the colors a bit more spot-on with the Mi 4c's panel. However, for its class, we really can't fault it too much. The resolution is super-crisp, colors jump out vividly from behind the glass, and the screen is usable in any type of environment – there's not much more one could ask from a midrange-priced phone.. 5.43 x 2.74 x 0.31 inches. 138 x 69.6 x 7.8 mm. 5.98 x 2.95 x 0.39 inches. 151.8 x 74.9 x 9.85 mm. 5.74 x 2.79 x 0.29 inches. 145.75 x 70.8 x 7.26 mm. 5.79 x 2.86 x 0.31 inches. 147 x 72.6 x 7.9 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The numbers below represent the amount of deviation in the respective property, observed when a display is viewed from a 45-degree angle as opposed to direct viewing.. Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better..

Well, I have, and I assure you that even with a stock MIUI ROM it's still far from being good.

I am sorry PA, but having used a Mi 4i which has the same software and an inferior hardware, there is no question that its a great device. But when you consider the price, it blows everything out of the water. Its the only Chinese brand with genuine customer support centers in almost all major cities here in India, so the risks involved in buying the phone is also significantly lesser compared to other Chinese brands. A great screen , good camera, great processor (and raw specs so to say), a very popular OS and decent customer support. This phone has the recipe to be a great phone. And for the price, its arguably one of the best phones on offer currently. Its not Mi's fault that you got a faulty device. So for me, your rating makes no sense whatsoever. I am starting to believe the trolls here who go on about PA being biased to this and that.. posted on 02 Nov 2015, 08:45. in response to #14 Hide. "...buying it from a 3rd party retailer means that there is a good chance one will need to do a lot of tinkering with the handset before it becomes fully functional. There's also a lot of manual maintenance required if you wish the phone to work at its best – all things that knock off points from user-friendliness. Last, but certainly not least, we find the fact that the phone often refuses to accept push notifications a pretty serious offense, seeing as it's a device that's meant to work first and foremost as a tool for communication". If you are fine having a phone (a communication device) that limits and sometimes just eliminates communication then more power to you; but that doesn't make it a good phone, in fact it makes it unacceptable and not worth it even for the price. And there are other alternatives and better choices, Moto G, Alcatel Idol, etc... (Posts: 686; Member since: 25 Jan 2009). posted on 02 Nov 2015, 10:34. in response to #14 Hide. Mi4i is great device?

Bad notifications system, bad UI elements, bad optimisation, no amount of horsepower or specs superiority can cover it up. Stop giving PhoneArena flak for pointing out THE TRUTH, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth! Chinese phones still have a SIGNIFICANT way to go in terms of software. Sure, there's the Huawei Nexus 6P, but it runs Pure Google, American Google, and isn't meant for China. Even the most bloated of Samsung phones run software and are better optimised than Chinese ROM's with the identical specs. Chinese made software sent to the rest of the world is crap, end of story..
