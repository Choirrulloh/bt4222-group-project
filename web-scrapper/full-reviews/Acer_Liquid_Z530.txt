Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed.

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards.

The screen, battery of the phone are its stand out features. Technology Tech Reviews Acer Liquid Z530 review: Budget phone with great battery life,. Rating: 3.5 out of 5. Acer Liquid Z530 is a compact budget smartphone with which Acer aims to deliver on one primary thing – the right smartphone experience. The Acer Liquid Z530 holds its ace in the battery department.

While Acer is well known in the computing space but hasn’t really created a niche. Like Dell , Acer also withdrew from the smartphone space for sometime and now intends to make a comeback. Acer has already announced its support for Microsoft ’s Windows 10 mobile ecosystem and now the company is re-entering India with a budget smartphone running Google ’s Android operating system.. The Liquid Z530 is a compact budget smartphone with which Acer aims to deliver on one primary thing – the right smartphone experience. Acer has tried to tick a lot of right boxes with the Liquid Z530 but can it take on competing devices from Micromax and Karbonn ? Read our review to find out.. Watch Video: Acer Liquid Z530 First Look. Specs: 5.0-inch (720 x 1280p, ~294 ppi) LCD display | Quad-core 1.3GHz Mediatek MT6735 processor | 2GB RAM | 16GB storage (expandable up to 32GB) | 8MP rear camera + 8MP front | Li-Ion 2420 mAh battery | Android Lollipop OS. this is the most compact smartphone I have handled in recent times. It’s almost as if smartphone manufacturers have forgotten to make devices for those with tiny hands. Though my hands are not tiny, this one fits perfectly and that is a welcome change. To put things in perspective, the Karbonn Titanium Mach Five is nearly 2 mm taller than the Liquid Z530.. The display is at the core of any smartphone experience and Acer Liquid Z530 packs one of the finest 720p HD panels in this price point. The colours are vivid and there is no noticeable pixel jarring common with LCD panels. Even viewing angles are great thanks to that IPS panel..

Flipkart What To Buy: Acer Liquid E700 vs Motorola Moto G vs Asus Zenfone. Acer has paid special attention to speakers on this device. Instead of going for those CNC drilled speaker grills at the bottom, Acer has opted for DTS surround supported loud speakers at the rear. These speakers sound great, the audio is crisp. When listening to vocal rich songs, the Liquid Z530 shines. The Liquid Z530 has the loudest speakers in the price range and you’ll easily recognise Coldplay when played on this one.. The Acer Liquid Z530 holds its aces in the battery department. The battery easily lasts a day and with moderate usage, this phone won’t need a battery re-plug before the end of the day (Though carrying a charger is always recommended).. Acer has customised Android Lollipop with its own skin and it is definitely not distasteful. The quick access to notes, calculator and calendar from the notification tray which float on your home screen may be a Samsung rip off, but it’s a very good addition to the budget smartphone. Also Acer’s own Bluelight Shield makes reading easy at night.. Acer has failed to get one of the most used feature of any smartphone right – camera. The camera is somewhat slower to focus than the competing devices. When it ends up focusing right, the colours are not really accurate.. Also the back cover of the device is way too flimsy and after you remove it twice or more, you start wondering if it’s destined to break. Acer could have done better here.. Acer has made a great smartphone for budget conscious audience. If your primary needs are a compact smartphone that offers great battery life and sounds great, Acer has you completely covered here. But if camera is your top priority then Karbonn’s Titanium Mach Five wins the vote.. For all the latest Technology News , download Indian Express App. © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd.

2 years ago November 5, 2015. Acer may not be the frontrunner in the smartphone market, but the company has been doing some commendable work with their Liquid Series of smartphones in the past couple of years. This year at IFA Week in Berlin, the company first introduced their new line-up of Liquid Smartphones , which included a total of four phones; Z630 , Z630S , Z530 , and Z530S. Now the company has launched Z530 in India today , as its move to expand their smartphone business in the country. We have had a chance to play with their latest budget friendly phone for quite a while and here is our detailed review of the same.. The device comes in only Black color and sports a compact design, the front, and back, both sports an unusual design language not found on most budget smartphones. One thing can be said, for the pricing it comes you get a quite nicely designed smartphone. The device sports a large earpiece alongside the set of sensors and a camera module on the top front bezel while the bottom bezel houses Acer branding. Instead, the company have given on-screen menu and home buttons.. It’s usually annoying when the power button is placed on the top edge, but since, the device have a compact size, I don’t mind the placement of power button on top edge. Moreover, the audio jack is also placed on the same edge. The bottom edge has microUSB and primary microphone. The right edge houses the volume rocker keys while the left edge is kept clean.. On the rear side of the device, there is a brushed plastic back panel with Acer branding at center. Though, the first thing you’ll not is the loudspeaker, which is placed on the bottom half of rear side. The rear camera module, which is placed on top half of the rear side, is aligned with a circular speaker grill. Alongside the rear camera sensor, you have an LED flasehlight and a secondary microphone. The speaker on the device is powered by DTS Sound technology and is claimed to offer loud and crystal sound than any other average speaker. And it was quite true; the output of this speaker was great. Underneath that pack panel is the battery compartment, two SIM slots, and a microSD slot neatly housed.. Overall, the Z530 offers a solid build design, and its mixture of conventional and unconventional aesthetics allows it to be quite a unique handset in the budget range of smartphones. That’s as better as one could ask from any handset in the budget segment.. Sporting a 5-inch 720p resolution display, the screen on this affordable phone looks astonishing for its size. All thanks to the pixel density, which is around 294 PPI (Pixel Per Inch), it’s not very high, but an admirable number allowing you to see clear images on the device. I wouldn’t say that it’s a media consumption screen, but watching casual YouTube Videos should be perfectly fine for it. Remember, it would only load up to 720p videos, so don’t look so surprising when you can’t find the option of 1080p because the app only shows what is supported by the display.. The sunlight legibility of the screen is pretty impressive too for its price, the content on the device is visible even in the brightest of the day when you’re outdoors accessing your phone. But make sure the brightness levels are full; otherwise you can’t see a thing on this little display.. It’s not AMOLED display, but I still like the color output on the LCD panel of this device, sometimes it might look dull, but that’s just the default wallpapers on the device are not good. The company claims that their Zero Air Gap technology ensures the bright rendering of colors, and we almost agree there. Overall, the color reproduction is pretty fine on the device.. The screen isn’t a fingerprint magnet as opposed to most of the devices in this range does, but occasionally your fingerprints would leave the mark on the display. You shouldn’t sweat about it, though. I would say the screen is quite reflective, thus making it hard to find good viewing angles sometimes. Its’ one of brightest HD displays you can get in this range of smartphones.. The Liquid UI is based on the Android Lollipop 5.1 version; the interface seems pretty simple with an app drawer as well. Apart from the icons, quick settings panel and a couple of other things, the UI is pretty much stock, as the system settings remain same. It is a good thing as it seems company has only customized a few elements of launcher while sticking with the important parts like Settings area, recent menu and a lot of other countable things.. There are tons of pre-installed apps present on the device, and mostly are from Acer while there are third-party apps as well. The Acer set of services like, abFiles, abMusic, abPhoto, Acer Aid Kit, Acer Care Center, Acer Suggests, all of these services are cloud based services, for which you have to create Acer ID. There are couple of dedicated kid’s apps as well, such as Kids Center and Kids Center Painter. The company has also included games like Danger Dash, Ninja Up and other 50+ free games that can be installed as they came bundled with the device in association with GameLoft.. All these bloatware installed on the device takes around 3GB of storage space while another 3GB is taken by system OS. So, you get around 10GB of internal storage free on the device. If that’s not enough, then you can always opt a microSD card slot, although, it’s sad that device doesn’t support OTG, which we tested out to know whether or not it’s true. There is a dedicated personalization app, Liquid Wizard, a fancy name for theme’s app, it allows you to change not only basic themes, but you can also change the font size, ringtones, wallpapers and many more aspects within one app. Overall, the interface is quite fast, even if it’s filled with such amount of bloatware.. The device is powered by a MediaTek MT6735 processor and is combined with Mali-T720 GPU, which can support up to 1080p resolution, so it was no sweat for graphics unit as the Z530 has a 720p display. Moreover, this MediaTek chipset is considered to be more powerful than Snapdragon 410 as per the reports in benchmarks test. The benchmark tests are for numbers satisfaction that whether a device is potentially more powerful than other or not. We tested out the Z530 for benchmark apps like Antutu and Vellamo. The Antutu revealed a score of around 25000, which is quite good for a budget handset. The Vellamo scores are; 1141 for Multicore, 1028 for Metal, 2224 for Browser test. All these scores don’t mean anything if the system can’t offer good performance. We did a browsing test on the device and were satisfied with the experience, even for a small real estate, the device offered good browsing experience.. We were not surprised that the device offered swift enough performance regarding multitasking as well as gaming. First talking about the gaming, this little budget phone offered an amazing gameplay experience. We didn’t notice any lag or whatsoever while playing games like Riptide GP2 and Dead Trigger 2 while the company has installed many games; we tried the above games to test GPU abilities as they are quite intense when it comes to graphics.. Before, talking about the multitasking let me clear one thing, the device heats up a lot during gameplay. After a couple of minutes of gaming, the rear camera part heats up a lot that you won’t be able to carry on the gaming. The multitasking is as smooth as it gets for a budget device, although, we expect a lot regarding apps switching, but there was a noticeable lag while switching between apps.. With a combination of 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage, the Z530 is one of the rarest in a budget segment that offers such amount of RAM and internal storage for the pricing it is available to purchase. The free RAM available most of the time on the device was averaging around 1GB while around 700MB was used by system and 240MB was being used by apps running in the background.. The device comes with an 8-megapixel camera sensor on the rear while on the front there is an 8-megapixel sensor as well, so yeah it is a selfie dedicated smartphone if you’re wondering. And it is one of the cheapest selfie smartphone camera available on the market right now. Although, when coming to the talk of whether the captures are great or not, I was not as impressed, as I thought I would be.. Acer Liquid Z530 – Natural Light 4. Acer Liquid Z530 – Natural Light 5.

The color reproduction feels too artistic while the focusing seems to be the issue here. The rear module cannot do the autofocus correctly unless you tap on it; well then what’s the use of the AF actually, if you’re anyway going to do it manually. But having said that, the outputs in the artificial and natural light look quite good once you get past the focusing issue. The white balance seems to be good as well..

Coming to the indoor capabilities of the camera module, it does offer good enough capture if the lighting is minimal enough. I was seating in a café and took some shot with Z530, they turned out average, the macro shot of the coffee beans was not great while it capture the glowing yellow bulb pretty well.

It is capable of shooting up to 1080p video recording. Even though, the video stabilization option as enabled, the shakes seem to affect the video quality. So, I don’t recommend this device if you’re looking for a device with good recording quality.. The front-facing camera on the device isn’t what I was expecting either; there is an 8-megapixel camera on the front, which isn’t even good when compared with the likes of 5MP shooter. It was supposed to be the USP of the device. With the large resolution, you expect a better quality images. But that wasn’t a case here. The colors again seem to be artistic and not natural. Both the cameras; rear and front behaves similarly when it comes to photos and videos.. The Liquid Z530 comes with a small 2420mAh capacity battery, which would have been enough if the screen has lower resolution than 720p. The screen is one of the brightest. Thus, it requires much power to showcase the content. With 8.9mm thickness, the company might have added a much larger capacity battery, but I guess that would be too much to ask from a budget smartphone.. Though, the standby on the device is pretty much good, as the battery drop during the idle time was around 5%, which is good enough. All thanks to the Standby Intelligent Power Saving mode. It won’t offer much screen on time than three hours or so, but that should be fine for an average usage. Then, the battery life would easily last over the day. I would suggest you enable the battery saver when the percentage is around 30%.. The device comes with connectivity features like 4G LTE connection, Dual SIM slots, microSD card slot and bunch of other usual connectivity features. The most interesting part of all this is the 4G LTE connection, which allows users to have fast data network over their smartphone. I mean its blazing fast, although, India is yet to see a 4G network country widespread, but that said the smartphones these days are more focused in offering such features. We tested out the download and upload speed on the device and it seem pretty good overall, considering there might be signal strength variation according to the places.. The most important part in the dual SIM setup is the Dual Standby mode, which is the phenomenal thing. It allows you to take calls from second SIM even if you’re on the call from the first SIM. That’s as convenient as it gets for dual-SIM setup. The other set of connectivity features such as Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, A–GPS and Wi-Fi are the basic things that was offered on the device.. The Acer is not a recognized brand in smartphones among the consumers, but it certainly has some of the unique offerings of the smartphone industry. Such as the Liquid E700 and the Liquid Jade , after these two handsets, Liquid Z530 is company’s officially third smartphone in Indian market. We liked certain things on the handsets, such as its unique design language, a familiar but custom UI and most of all the brilliant display. There are many contenders in the budget range that are worthy against this handset including Xiaomi Redmi 2 Prime , Lenovo A6000 Plus , and Yu Yunique. These are some of the handsets that you can go with if you’re not into the Acer Liquid Z530.. Top 5 Smartphones of 2016 that received the Highest Unofficial Price Drop.

Average Score: 69% - average Average of. 69% Acer Liquid Z530 Source: Think Digit All in all The Acer Liquid Z530 is a good phone and a genuine try by the company. It comes almost at par with our current sub-7K recommendation, the Meizu M2. The Z530 comes really close but its camera is not able to keep up with the 13MP shooter on the Meizu M2. That said, the Acer Z530 should and does get our recommendation. So, if you are looking for a sub-7K smartphone and don't want to get into the whole flash sale system of Meizu M2, buy the Acer Z530 instead. Single Review, online available, Very Short, Date: 12/10/2015 Rating: Total score : 69%. This is a typical smartphone diagonal.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. While Acer still had the third largest global market share in the notebook segment in 2008, it ranked 6th in 2016 with a market share of 6% after they had continuously lost market shares.. There are dozens of Acer laptop reviews per month, the ratings are average (as of 2016). Gateway, which has an own laptop line-up, has also belonged to the Acer Group since 2007..

Acer Liquid Z530 - user opinions and reviews. 8GB storage, microSD (dedicated slot) card slot. Pages: 1 2 3 … 17 18 ». Bought this for my wife and it's given us nothing but problems. Initially the phone wouldn't stay on due to a loose battery connection so we exchanged it for another one. Since then, it has had random problems such as rapid battery drain and storage issues. The amount of bloatware that the phone comes with does not help with storage either. Due to a locked bootloader and minimal support online, the phone can't be rooted to address these issues. We were attracted to the phone by solid specs and a great price point, but the above issues have left a terrible impression and I will never buy an Acer phone again.. It is too heat and battery backup is low. Please send link and support since my acer liquid is LTE. arul, 22 Feb 2017 acer z530 support jio sim or not yes support.

You can now Flash SuperSU zip in order to gain Root. - You should answer Yes when asking "Disable Flash Recovery". - You should answer No when asking to "Push root with /system/xbin/su". This happens because CWM don't regconize very well the su binary installed by SuperSU (it's looking for the superuser one). NB : If you power on your device after the CWM flash, there is many chance that the system will erase the recovery by the stock one. In this case, CWM is lost, and you should make the Guide again and make sure to Reboot into CWM right after the flashing process.. Recovery key combination for Jade (S55), Jade S (S56), Jade Z (S57) : When the device is totally off, press Volume-UP button and HOLD it. Press Power button (keep holding Volume-UP), and HOLD both of Power & Volume-UP. When the device vibrates for the first time, release Power, but keep holding Volume-UP. As soon as it vibrates a second time, move from Volume-UP button (release it) to Volume-DOWN button (hold it). It vibrates again, you can release all buttons and recovery is loaded.

I upgraded my phone and now it has Acer_AV0K0_E39_1.020.00_AAP_GEN1. I was wondering if it is necessary to downgrade (flash the stock rom provided in this post) first, or I can simply flash CWM and then flash SuperSU. Another question is that if I do downgrade first and then root, would the root be removed once upgraded via OTA?. Join Date: Joined: Feb 2012.

I think you can directly flash CWM and flash SuperSU, it should work fine. The only thing is with CWM and Root, OTA may not work anymore, so you will have to unroot and maybe flash back the original Recovery to upgrade via OTA..

Acer Liquid Z530 First Impressions: An average looking affordable selfie smartphone. Updated: Saturday, November 7, 2015, 12:09 [IST]. Acer introduced its lower end smartphone the Liquid Z530, alongside the launch of its Liquid Z630s smartphone to cater to the budget conscious consumers. The company says that these smartphones will be its offerings not just for Diwali, but for Christmas and new year as well.. The Liquid 530 has been competitively priced for Rs 6,990 which makes it yet another affordable offering in the already flooded smartphone market in India. However, Acer claims that this is not just another phone as it has been designed while keeping consumer's need in mind. The company promotes it as a selfie-centric handset, with quad-core chipset, 2GB of RAM, and 4G support, and says that they have developed the software features to make them useful for consumers.. 8MP selfie camera | 4G LTE support. Nothing innovative in terms of design | Thick. Acer Liquid Z530 does have some good specs, but the question is whether it will be able to beat the competition in the market? Acer, feels they might not be able to create ripples in the market right away, but they are sure that their phones will be perceived well in the market.. We were at the launch event of the Acer Liquid Z530 smartphone and here are our first impressions.. The Acer Liquid Z530 does not bring any innovation on the design front, nor is it the best looking smartphone in this price. It is made of plastic looks boring and old-fashioned. The phone is quite thick at 8.9mm, but is comfortable to be used single handedly. The front panel of the phone features a 5.1-inch display, which has thick bezel on top and bottom, which are actually waste spaces. The front panel has a secondary snapper and Acer branding, besides the screen with 720p resolution. The display is vivid and reproduces colours well, but we have seen better in this price segment.. right side of the phone hosts volume keys, and the power key has been placed on top side along with the audio jack. The bottom houses a microUSB port. When you look at the rear panel, you will notice two cameras, but actually there is one rear camera on top and the bottom one is a speaker that look like camera. The back panel can be removed to expose the battery, SIM card slots and microSD card slot.. Over all the smartphone looks average.. Under the hood, the Liquid Z530 has a 1.3GHz MediaTek 6735 quad-core chipset which is paired with 2GB of RAM, which is supported with 16GB of internal storage space that can be expanded further using a microSD card. The chipset is widely used on phones in this price range, and should be good to operate the phone smoothly.. Acer Liquid Z530 dons an 8MP front-facing camera, which also is the USP of the phone. The front facing snapper is fixed focus, has 84 degree wide-angle lens, and is capable of recording 1080p videos. The rear also adorns an 8MP auto-focus snapper with flash and 1080p video recording capabilities. Acer has added some editing tools and modes to modify images. As for the camera performance, the ambient lighting conditions were not apt to test the camera of the phone.. Acer has wrapped the Android 5.1 Lollipop under its own skin which, as per company claims, has useful features but is not heavy to hamper the user experience. Some of the features include multiple window opening feature that allows users to launch multiple windows on a screen while still using an app on screen. In addition to that, the phone features AcerEXTEND app which let a user beam the phone screen on their desktop. The UI looked simple, but more can be said about it only after we review the device.. The budget smartphone space in India is highly competitive considering that it is crowded with local as well as Chinese smartphone brands who try their best to entice consumers. The Acer Liquid Z530 might not look appealing but it does pack in some decent specifications such as an 8MP selfie camera. However, there is nothing extraordinary about the phone, which make it just another offering in this space. Hence, it will be facing tough competition from its rivals from Yu, Micromax, Xiaomi and Coolpad brands in the market.. It would be too early to judge a smartphone's performance on the basis of its looks or specs on paper, and we will tell you more about it in our detailed review.. Stay tuned to know more about the Acer Liquid Z530s smartphone till we review the phone..
