CNET también está disponible en español.. Microsoft Lumia 950 XL review:. This capable phone lacks the sparkle of a true flagship. The Good The Microsoft Lumia 950 XL has a pin-sharp, vivid display, plenty of power, expandable storage and a solid camera.. The Bad The app selection for Windows phone is still very limited and the phone's design feels plasticky.. The Bottom Line While the Lumia 950 XL has the specs you'd want from a top-end phone, the Windows 10 experience offers no compelling reason to switch from iOS or Android.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. How much bigger is the 950 XL over the 950? What other design elements should I know about?. Microsoft launched the Lumia 950 XL and its little brother, the Lumia 950 to usher in the new era of Windows 10 for mobile. The 950 XL is the larger of the two phones, packing a 5.7-inch display, but bringing few features of its own.. Just as you'd expect from the flag bearers for Microsoft's latest mobile software, the phones are stuffed with the latest technology on offer. The 950 XL has a pin-sharp high-res display, a powerful octa-core processor and a great 20-megapixel camera, but it's all let down by the software.. While Windows 10 for mobile is a refreshing change from iOS or Android, and it's pretty straightforward to use, it's plagued by the same issue that faced Windows Phone 8 before it: apps. The app store is still woefully understocked compared to Android and iOS, and app developers rarely put any effort into bringing new releases to Microsoft's mobile apps first.. This could change with Microsoft's universal apps which theoretically can work across the mobile and desktop versions of Windows 10. App developers then would have a much larger audience to develop for and would therefore be more keen to bring their apps to Windows sooner.. App issues aside, the Lumia 950 XL is a perfectly capable phone, and if you're already a Windows Phone user who isn't keen to switch operating systems it's the most powerful Windows phone you can buy right now, even slightly more so than the 950. Windows 10 for mobile needs a lot of work however before it becomes a compelling choice over Android or iOS -- at this rate, that doesn't seem likely.. You can pick the Lumia 950 XL up now in the UK for £530, in the US for $649, and for $1,129 in Australia, all directly from Microsoft.. Quite a bit, as it has to squeeze in that larger 5.7-inch display. The XL measures 152mm long and 78.4mm wide (5.9 x 3-inches), versus the standard 950's 145 x 73.2mm (5.7 x 2.8-inches). You'll notice the extra size of the XL when you try to stretch your thumbs across to type -- it's not a phone for one-handed use. If you prefer your phones a little more compact and easier to hold, the smaller 950 might be better for you.. There's a minor cosmetic change to the camera unit -- the 950's has a silver ring around the lens, while the XL has a black disc -- but otherwise both phones look identical. They have the same removable plastic back panel, which feels every bit as flimsy here as it does on the 950. It's a very plain design, as well, and certainly not one that will pique much interest in gadget fans. If style is your chief concern, look toward the curving glass and metal of the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge .. Beneath the plastic back panel is a microSD card slot, which supports cards up to 200GB. The battery is removable and the phone charges using the latest USB Type C -- features shared on both the 950 and the XL.. Both the Lumia 950 and 950 XL share the same 2,560x1,440-pixel resolution. As the XL's screen is physically bigger, however, it means those pixels are spread out over a wider area, reducing the pixel density. While the XL has a pixel density of 513 pixels per inch, the smaller 950 has that beaten with 564 ppi. It's not a difference that you'd ever notice though.. The XL's display is crystal clear, lending high-res photos and videos a satisfying level of clarity. Black levels are deep, resulting in good contrast too. Its larger size helps show off photos and videos in a more immersive way, but both screens are great for everyday essentials.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition....

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 32 GB + MicroSD. View all photos (58). Click to read the full review. Based on 17 User reviews. Extremely high pixel density screen (515 ppi). The Microsoft Lumia 950 XL is a large and powerful smartphone powered by the Windows 10 Phone OS. It stands out with its 5.7-inch, OLED display packing 1440 by 2560 pixels. Inside it ticks Qualcomm's octa-core Snapdragon 810 SoC which has been liquid-cooled to facilitate heat dissipation. And the camera is one worth being excited about – a 20MP sensor with OIS and a tripple LED flash is found at the back. The latter uses three LEDs to produce more natural colors. Further specs include 32GB of on-board storage, a microSD card slot, a 3440mAh battery that can last through 19h of talk time. The USB Type-C port at the bottom is a welcome bonus.. Microsoft Lumia 950 XL Review Microsoft Lumia 950 XL manual Microsoft Lumia 950 XL benchmarks. Dimensions: 5.98 x 3.09 x 0.32 inches (151.9 x 78.4 x 8.1 mm). Weight: 5.82 oz (165 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Features: Iris scanner, Touch sensitive control keys. Display Physical size: 5.7 inches. Resolution: 1440 x 2560 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 4), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Optical image stabilization, Autofocus, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI). Software Features: Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. 3840x2160 (4K) (30 fps), 1920x1080 (1080p HD) (60 fps), 1280x720 (720p HD) (120 fps). Features: Optical image stabilization, Continuous autofocus, Video light, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 2000 MHz, ARM Cortex-A57 and ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 25.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 12.0 days (288 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 19.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share, SlimPort.

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

These have ranged from lofty claims about a new category of “Universal Apps”, iris-scanning Windows Hello tech and, of course, the Lumia range’s trademark PureView camera hardware.. The sheer number of promises have left many wondering if the company’s flagship Windows 10 Mobile phablet can actually live up to the claims. Sadly, the answer is not really.. Watch: 5 things you need to know about Windows 10 Mobile. Since Nokia, now Microsoft Devices, launched its first Windows Phone 7 smartphone – the Lumia 800 – many moons ago, the firm has rattled out a stream of unique-looking, brightly coloured handsets.. I’d hoped this trend would continue with the Lumia 950 XL, but sadly this isn’t the case. The black Lumia 950 XL on review is one of the dullest-looking phones I’ve held in quite some time. The phone lacks any obvious design features, save the shiny PureView camera sensor on its rear.. The polycarbonate casing doesn’t feel as robust as past Lumias; pressing on the phone’s removable backplate displayed more give than I’d like. Note that removing this rear shell isn’t for the faint-hearted either. Whenever I pried off the rear plate to get access to the phone’s microSD and SIM slots, it felt as though it was on the verge of snapping.. Once setup, though, the phone does tick many boxes. There’s a USB Type-C connector along its bottom edge, which in the coming months is forecast to replace micro-USB as the smartphone’s standard connector.. The power, volume and shutter buttons are well placed, so you can still reach them one-handed despite the phone’s plus-sized 152 x 78 x 8.1mm dimensions. The 165g weight means the 950 XL isn’t too heavy; the phone never feels cumbersome to hold.. Microsoft has loaded the Lumia 950 XL with an impressive 5.7-inch quad-HD, AMOLED display.. On paper, this puts the Lumia on a level-pegging with most competing plus-sized handsets. Google’s awesome Nexus 6P and Samsung’s reigning Galaxy Note 5 both feature similarly specced 5.7-inch QHD displays.. In real-world use, the Lumia 950 XL’s display easily matches its competitors. The screen’s 518ppi density ensures Live Tiles and text look universally sharp. The AMOLED tech also results in blacks that are among the deepest I’ve seen on a smartphone, and help to make colours look vibrant and rich. Whites do look a little red when compared to the Nexus 6P, but are far from the worst I’ve seen.. Although brightness isn’t the highest I’ve seen, it’s good enough for general use. Direct sunlight can result in the screen becoming reflective and therefore difficult to use, but that’s a universal issue affecting most of the smartphones I test..

Software Continuum Pricing and competition Summary and conclusions. Back in July, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote an email to employees stating that there would be three phone customer strategy : enterprise customers, value phone customers, and fans. After spending a couple of weeks with both the AT&T Lumia 950 and dual-SIM Lumia 950 XL it's clear that these phones are only ready for the die-hard fans that love Windows Phone.. The Lumia 950 XL is $100 less than the least expensive iPhone 6s Plus, but you really can't compare the two directly as the Lumia 950 is just a phone not the flagship we have been waiting for. The specifications match other flagships, but the uninspiring hardware shows little innovation, the well-known app gap exists, and Windows 10 Mobile is buggy. The camera is excellent and the live tile interface offers an efficient user experience.. I already posted my detailed first impressions so won't go over those thoughts again. I've come to like the matte finish and feel of the Lumia 950 XL, despite the simple design.. It's nice to see Microsoft include a USB to USB Type-C cable along with a USB Type-C A/C adapter in the box. This is especially helpful if you buy the Microsoft Display Dock .. As you can see the specifications match other flagships for the most part. The Microsoft website, and the device itself, are a bit in error though where it stated secure NFC for payment since Microsoft currently lacks a mobile payment system.. While a dual-SIM device may appeal to the world traveler, I'm very disappointed in the compromises that were made with such a configuration. Visual voicemail doesn't work and everything I've been able to find about this states that the dual-SIM implementation is the reason why. After a hard reset and then full setup via WiFi before adding my T-Mobile SIM I was able to get MMS working. WiFi Calling also does not work on T-Mobile, but the specs list it as supported so it may be possible in the future.. The two Lumia devices are very similar with the differences being the screen size, processor, and battery. I like big phones so had no issue with the 950 XL, but I think the 950 will appeal to more people who want something a bit more pocketable.. The front is dominated by the display and thankfully we see Microsoft went with Nokia's ClearBlack technology here again. The display looks fantastic and while Windows Phone has never needed high resolution to look good, it doesn't get much better than these display.. There's a bit more of a ridge rising above the flat glass display on the 950 than on the 950 XL. The front facing camera and iris scanner are located above the display. A red light shines so you know exactly where to look and unlock your device with Windows Hello.. The Windows Hello feature seemed to work pretty well in most lighting conditions with and without my glasses, but it was faster to enter a PIN to unlock the phone. I found I had to hold the Lumia about a foot or less from my face, which is fine most of the time since you are going to look at your phone anyway. However, I find fingerprint scanners to be much faster and more convenient.. On both phones, there is nothing on the left side, a 3.5mm headset jack on the top (one is centered, the other off to the right), and a centered USB Type-C port on the bottom. The left side contains the same power, volume, and camera capture buttons, but strangely the power button sits between the two volume buttons on the Lumia 950 XL. This took a bit of time to get used to.. The 20 megapixel PureView Zeiss cameras are found cented on the back. As you can see in my image gallery, the cameras have slightly different designs on each device. The camera performed very well, matching the best Android phones and beating the Apple iPhone 6s Plus. While there are a couple samples in my image gallery, feel free to browse the full resolution images and make your own judgements by viewing my Flickr album .. At first I was a bit disappointed in the uninspiring design, but after a few days I came to be satisfied with the finish and feel in my hand. The plastic is not as good as older Lumia devices like the 1520, but it is usually a more durable material for drops.. It's great to have a hardware camera button again on a phone and still wish we would see others add this as more and more of us use our phones as our primary camera.. I've been using Windows Phone since the beginning and before that Pocket PC. Windows Phone 7 was rock solid so I expected the same here with Windows 10 Mobile. It's strange to now be more satisfied with the hardware than the software on a Microsoft smartphone.. In the past, my Windows Phone devices never locked up or reset. Yet, I've seen this happen several times on both phones. It was real fun to see the phone lock up while taking photos for my comparison that then required a full battery pull to get it up and running again.. At first I didn't have MMS on T-Mobile and no matter how many APNs I tried, I couldn't get it to work. I then performed a full reset on the Lumia 950 XL, setup everything using WiFi, and then put in my SIM card. That did the trick and MMS was up and running.. I did a comparison between the apps I have installed on my iPhone and Android phones, only to find just a few key apps missing. Windows 10 Mobile is clearly missing the vast library of apps on iOS and Android, but the core OS is very functional and capable for many people. Banking is a huge gap area, but my primary question is why compromise on apps when there are options out there that offer everything? Until Microsoft can clearly articulate this and offer compelling reasons, I can't recommend the Lumia 950/950 XL for anyone other than die-hard Windows Phone fans.. It's really sad to see apps like Outlook Mail work better on iOS and Android than on Windows 10 Mobile though. While the unified inbox is one missing feature, I'm more disappointed in the lack of Focused and Other tabs. These tabs help my rock my email on my iPhone 6s Plus and Outlook is so good on iOS that I use it as my default email client.. The Action Center, Cortana, and keyboard are all excellent and some of my favorite features of Windows 10 Mobile.. There is a Display Dock offer that you are supposed to be able to get with the purchase of a Lumia 950 XL. However, the Lumia Offers app keeps reporting errors so I'm not sure if the limited quantity is actually gone or if it's just another example of a failed Microsoft piece of software. Either way, it's not a good experience for a new phone owner which is yet another clear example of why this isn't a smartphone option for the novice.. Continuum seems like a cool technology and makes for a decent demo. However, unless you are in a developing country without access to a computer I don't know what the use case is for using it with a Windows Phone.. The Display Dock requires power via USB Type-C and then offers three USB, HDMI, and a DisplayPort connection. A USB Type-C port on the front connects to your Lumia 950/950 XL. Your phone will charge up via the dock connection too.. I connected my 22 inch Dell monitor and was impressed by what I saw at first. It looked like Windows 10 on my display. Email performed very well and the web browser was fine. Most apps did not work and a notification popped up letting me know that I could still use the app on my phone.. It was helpful to use the phone display as the mouse, but you can also add a Bluetooth or wired mouse if you like.. Office looked great at first, but when I tried to create a spreadsheet a notification popped up stating that I had to be an Office 365 customer. I have been for a couple years, but no matter what I tried I could not get the software to understand that my Live.com login has an account. I wasn't going to buy another subscription to test it out either.. Continuum on the Display Dock was enjoyable for the most part and I'm sure we'll see continued work on it to get more apps working.. Microsoft Lumia 950 and 950 XL product and... 1 - 5 of 31. The Lumia 950 is $549 while the Lumia 950 XL is $649 at the Microsoft Store. AT&T charges $598.99 for the Lumia 950 and is currently the only carrier offering the device.. The Lumia 950 XL is $100 less than the lowest priced 16GB iPhone 6s Plus and is an even better value when you consider your storage options. The Lumias are value priced compared to the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.. However, the fantastic Nexus 6P 64GB model is 549. T-Mobile has the LG V10, also with a removable battery and microSD card slot, available for $600.. Compared to the other flagships, the Lumia 950 XL is priced about right. However, there is an obvious difference in the applications, both in terms of quantity as well as quality, and very few are purchasing Lumia devices. Thus, I expect the price to drop rather quickly as new phones launch in early 2016 and rumors of the Microsoft Surface phone continue to heat up.. I still have a Lumia 830 kicking around that I turn on occasionally to test out the latest Windows 10 Mobile. The fit and finish is a lot better than these new Lumia devices and other than the excellent camera I don't see any reason to upgrade to a Lumia 950 or 950 XL.. My Lumia 950 XL purchase will be returned this week. After testing the Lumia 950 for a few days, I really wanted to like and keep the 950 XL. However, the lack of full T-Mobile support and unstable performance are forcing me to return it. I could live with the less functional apps for the most part, but not when it cost me $711 out of my pocket.. I recommend you check out the Pocketnow and TechnoBuffalo reviews. Both were written by friends who have used Windows Phone for several years and tell a similar story to what I have written.. If the Lumia 950 XL drops down to the $500 range, sees updates to improve stability and performance, and developers start coming back (especially banks), then I may consider one again. I remain concerned about the future of Microsoft's phone strategy as this half-hearted attempt doesn't show me much committment to the smartphone market.. Given the experiences that I am seeing with the Lumia 950 XL and Windows 10 Mobile, not to mention the large number of forum posts describing other bugs and problems, I really am left to question if anyone at Microsoft truly cares about the smartphone space. BlackBerry lost the enterprise and everywhere I look I see Apple picking up the torch rather aggressively. It would be nice to see Microsoft compete here, but I don't think too many IT managers are ready to deal with so many compromises and issues when other platforms just work..

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Wireless charging Built-in (Qi) Built-in (Qi).

FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg)..

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Tempting for the Windows faithful, but no one else. With a superb camera, lovely screen and smooth performance, the Lumia 950 XL is an easy sell for the Windows faithful. But with few apps, many areas in need of polish and inconsistent battery life, it isn't for everyone.. Lumia flagships are a rare breed, not just in terms of new models, but on the street as well. Almost four years have passed since the Lumia 900 line began, and a lot has happened in that time – not least the evaporation of Windows Phone's already paltry market share.. The Nokia Lumia 930 , nominally the last flagship-class device in the WIndows Phone era, was released back in mid 2014, but the world has moved on.. Now, a QHD screen and a powerful 64-bit processor is the bare minimum that an elite-tier handset needs in order to compete. And with quality imaging also becoming the norm rather than the exception, there's little room for compromise at the top.. Against this, everything that once made the Lumia brand special no longer has such lustre. Optical imaging stabilisation is one such example – the thing that Nokia once did best is now commonplace.. Dreams of making smartphones for everyone and seeing Windows 10 Mobile conquer the world with coloured tiles have been replaced with a more modest ambition: making devices to reward fans who stuck with the OS through the lean times.. Enter the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL, alongside the Lumia 950 .. The Lumia 950 XL is, as the name suggests, the larger device of the two, and it boasts some hefty specifications too, meaning that on paper it looks to be a smartphone geek's dream.. But with the Android and iOS competition now so incredibly strong, is it really enough to restore consumer confidence in Microsoft's mobile vision?. Over its years as a smartphone maker Nokia built up a considerable design pedigree, and the Lumia line was no exception. With the handsets defined by the use of colourful matte polycarbonate, even a punter on the street could recognise the likes of a Lumia 920 at a distance.. Things have changed under the bean counters at Microsoft, and at first glance the Lumia 950 XL is almost totally unremarkable, at least from the front. The 5.7-inch AMOLED display, covered with a sheet of Gorilla Glass 4, takes up most of the faceplate, with only a small, minimalist 'Microsoft' logo adorning the top.. The rear of the handset also tends towards a corporate look and feel. A vast expanse of featureless black matte polycarbonate houses just two notable landmarks – a large, silver-ringed camera 'oreo', and a small Windows logo.. The power button and volume keys are on the right side, as you'd expect, but their layout is odd and confusing. Whereas the power button normally stands alone, on the Lumia 950 XL it's flanked by separate volume up and volume down keys.. This may sound like a minor detail, but as someone who's used Lumias on a daily basis for years I found the new button layout jarring throughout my review period. Moreover the buttons themselves, while nicely clicky, are quite sharp, making them feel unfinished.. On the same side you'll also find the two-stage camera shutter button, always a nice inclusion.. Thankfully, one trend that began a while back – the abandoning of removable backs – has been reversed here. The rear of the Lumia 950 XL is user-removable and replaceable, giving access to the microSD card slot and to the removable battery.. As the 950 XL is a phablet, using it in one hand was always going to be something of a challenge, but thanks to the weighting of the device it's not as bad as I feared it might be. Even at 8.1mm thick and 165g, and with my spindly little mitts, using the handset was never uncomfortable.. Overall, the design of the Lumia 950 XL is unremarkable. In a budget smartphone, I'd list that as a positive, especially given some of the weird-looking units that are occasionally trundled out; but in a 2015 flagship device that costs the best part of an iPhone, it's a different story.. When you're spending the sort of money on a handset that could buy you a week's holiday for two, the experience has to reflect that, and that experience starts when you first pick up the device.. Buy an iPhone 6S and the jewel-like feel is an instant reward, and the same goes for the Samsung Galaxy S6 or even the Google Nexus 6P. These devices are distinguishable and special, whereas the Lumia 950 XL is unfortunately reminiscent of its less-upmarket brother, the 640 XL.. Earlier Lumia devices gave the user a sense of identity in the hand, something unique, and that has been lost. Whether the diehard Windows faithful will care has yet to be seen, but other potential purchasers are unlikely to be blown away.. The genesis of a new operating system that prioritises a unique and cohesive design should be honoured in the hardware carrying it, such as with the Dell XPS 13 , and in this respect Microsoft has failed with the Lumia 950 XL.. The screen is another story altogether, and clear signs of Nokia's display heritage can be found in the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL. Outdoor visibility is pretty good, although it would be nice if the screen could become just a tad brighter. The 2K resolution of the 5.7-inch panel equates to a 518ppi, making text lovely and crisp, and enabling the Windows Live Tiles to really stand out.. As might be expected with an AMOLED screen, contrast is excellent. Colours have a very nice 'pop' to them, while blacks are pleasingly deep. Viewing angles are great, with no drop-off in either brightness or colour from any angle.. Somewhat unusually for an AMOLED display, the colour accuracy is also very good. Microsoft claims to have calibrated the panel exactly, and to my eyes I could find nothing wrong, although you have the option to change the white balance in the settings menu.. The device also supports a popular and somewhat mislaid feature in 'Glance', which enables the display of information when the phone is asleep. Double-tap to wake has been discarded, however..

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. It wasn’t supposed to happen like this. There’s not supposed to be a high-end Windows smartphone that looks awesome and has a specification list to drool over.. Time will tell if a smartphone running Windows 10 can squeeze a toe into the Android/iOS market domination. What’s clear today, however, is that. is giving it a genuine go, with clear features designed to lure rivals over, some of which might just do the trick.. If you’re not familiar with my buying guides, then don’t forget to check out my Sony Xperia Z5 Premium , Xperia Z5 , iPhone 6S , Samsung Galaxy Note 5 , Samsung Galaxy Note Edge+ , Moto X Pure and OnePlus 2 .. This is Microsoft’s ace up its sleeve. has long been evolving its Lumia and Surface ranges into the go-to devices for productivity enthusiasts, with purchases of Accompli and Wunderlist. Continuum brings all of it together by making your experience from mobile to desktop as similar as possible. I’m sure there’s more to be seen from Continuum (like Snap view) but the core concept is brilliant. Once you plug in the display, keyboard and mouse, you’re essentially mimicking the desktop experience: it’s not a mirrored image of your mobile display, but something that looks and acts like Windows 10 desktop via your mobile. Apps like Outlook operate the same as they do on desktop because they are, essentially, the same app: but simply resized and re-skinned, depending on how you’re viewing them.. This is Continuum’s main sell to users and developers. With apps being the same across all platforms, you’re never without the tools you need to work, and your mobile has access to the wealth of apps available on PC. Of course, the amount of apps that work across mobile and desktop are limited at the moment, but that could dramatically change in the near future, if all developers are as excited as the one’s I’ve spoken to are .. Microsoft’s introduction of liquid cooling to its Lumia range is sure to reignite the Snapdragon 810 chipset's overheating rumours. But, in reality, it’s more to do with Continuum and what the Lumia 950 Xl is capable of.. As discussed above, running Windows 10 means that users can run (some) desktop applications on the 950 XL - even connecting it to a display and mouse for the full desktop experience. Using your smartphone like a desktop PC is super-taxing on its components and will generate a lot of heat: enter liquid cooling. To briefly explain, liquid cooling involves water (or another liquid) moving around a device to cool particular components when the pressure is on. That should mean a smooth running device capable of handling intense tasks with little complaint..

Checking Out The Lumia 950 XL. Lumia 950 XL Camera and Battery Life. Closing Thoughts On The Lumia 950 XL. Lumia 950 XL Introduction and Specifications. Forget almost everything you’ve read about the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL up to this point. We know that’s a bold statement, but bear with us here. Save for the phone’s specifications, if there’s one thing we’ve learned evaluating the 950 XL over the last few weeks it’s that virtually everything from the OS to the camera app has been changed or updated very recently, and it has affected battery life, responsiveness, and browsing, among many other things. Information published about the Lumia 950 XL that's any more than a couple of weeks old is simply outdated. It seems that Microsoft was tweaking a large number of elements and features in preparation for Windows 10 Mobile’s “official” release on a wide range of devices. Sure, Windows 10 came pre-installed on the Lumia 950 series , but there have been major changes over the phones’ relatively short lifespan. In any case, we’ve been using the Lumia 950 XL as our daily driver for a few weeks now, in place of a Lumia 1520, which had already been updated to Windows 10. We think we’ve gotten a very good feel for the phone and how it compares to previous-gen devices, and have our thoughts detailed on the pages ahead -- along with a slew of benchmarks, of course. If you’re one of the select few contemplating a move to Windows 10 Mobile read on to find out if the Lumia 950 XL is right for you....

If you're a regular HotHardware reader, you're no doubt familiar with the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL and its smaller cousin, the Lumia 950 ( reviewed here ). For those of you that may not be familiar with Microsoft's latest smartphones, the video above offers a good summary of their main features and design. We'll have many more details on the pages ahead, though. The Lumia 950 XL's spec table is quite telling. This phone is packing some of the latest hardware available, including a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 SoC clocked at up to 2GHz, 3GB of RAM, USB 3.1, a QHD AMOLED display, and a bevy of sensors. The particular device we'll be showing you here also has a dual-SIM setup, which could come in handy if you're a frequent traveler. With dual-SIMs, you're able to select which SIM to use on a per-call or per-text basis, presumably to prevent roaming or other charges carries are known for tacking on when outside of your designated service area. Before we dig into the Lumia 950 XL, here's a look at what comes bundled with the phone. We're testing the dual-SIM variant here, but the bundle is similar for the single-SIM version. Included in the box -- along with the phone, of course -- is a basic lit pack, a USB-A to USB-C charge / sync cable, and a USB-C charger, with hard-wired cable. Unlike many other smartphones that include a a wall-wart with a USB port for charging, the charger included with the 950 XL is all one piece.. Microsoft Lumia 950 XL Accessory Bundle.

But, with one of the worst customer support. Here are few honest review after 1.5yrs of use. Mobile is good but lags in performance. Probably the best compared to any phone in this world. Also, Heats up like fire when you take more than 5-6 photos at a time. NO SPARE PARTS!!!! Let me repeat "NO SPARE PARTS IN THE MARKET EVEN AT THEIR OWN SERVICE CENTERS". Your battery will go dead with in 8-9 months. App Store is running out of apps. No new apps/games as developers are not working on windows platform. Updates are of no use as they don't solve any of your issues. Endless Struck screens and your phone will struck while reeving the call and your tone will struck too. All you will here is "TRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR" and you have to take of your battery in that scenario. Imagine a situation when you are with important people and suddenly you receive a call and your ringtone strucks and sounds like "TTTRRRRRRRRRRRRRR" and you cannot stop that without removing the battery. How embarrassing that is going to be. I love this phone for its camera quality. But i hate this phone because it is from Microsoft which has worst customer service in the world.

The Microsoft Lumia 950 XL currently has an Informr score of 6.9 out of 10.. This score is based on our evaluation of 20. sources including reviews from users and the web's most trusted critics.. What's good Sharp display with accurate colors and excellent contrast Camera provides detailed images in bright and low light situations Smooth performance. What's bad App gap between Android and iOS Mediocre sunlight legibility Boring and basic design. Windows continues to struggle in the smartphone market as Android and iOS gobble up the majority of their audience. Rather than focus on converting fans, the company now hopes to keep the remaining few they have with the release of the Lumia 950 XL .. As the name suggests, the XL sits firmly in the phablet territory, measuring in at 5.9 x 3 inches making it practically impossible for one-handed use. At 0.3 inches, it isn’t the thinnest smartphone on the market, but reviewers still found it quite comfortable to hold thanks to the rounded edges and light weight of 167 grams. This lightweight is due to the mainly plastic body, which critics found very flimsy. One of the best updates to the 950 XL, however, is the ability to switch out the case for something with a bit more flair. Users can choose from different designs and colors to suit their needs allowing for amazing personalization. Still despite this, many describe it as “bland” and “basic.”. For the most part, critics found the screen passable. The 5.7 inch AMOLED display has a resolution of 1,440 x 2,560, which translates to a pixel density of 518ppi. As expected, they didn’t have any issues with pixilation making for a very sharp display. Of course, sharpness isn’t everything, and luckily the 950 XL delivers. Almost everyone found the contrast perfect with excellent color accuracy all around. Unfortunately, it started to struggle once they got into bright light situations with text becoming almost illegible in sunlight.. Powering the phone is an octa-core 2.0GHz processor and 3GB of RAM. Microsoft has opted for liquid cooling to keep the processor from overheating, though reviewers still found it to get quite hot leading to worries about its longevity. In actual practice, the 950 XL performed well with no crashes or stutters occurring even when running multiple apps or gaming. And while it comes with 32GB of internal storage, it also has an expandable microSD slot. Like its predecessors, the biggest drawback is the lack of apps for Windows phones. The 3340mAh battery is also removable, which might come in handy as critics noticed battery life was fairly unpredictable. In general, they were able to get a full day’s worth of life with moderate usage.. Most Lumia owners don’t get the phone for its powerful specs. They get it for the camera and in this department the 950 XL excels. Armed with a 20MP rear camera, optical image stabilization and triple-LED RGB flash, experts consider this one of the strongest mobile cameras available. In good lighting, their pictures were detailed with accurate and vivid colors and excellent white balance. Even in low light situations, the pictures came out quite clear with very little noise. It also shoots 4K video, which they describe as “crisp and clear.”. Although the Lumia 950 is certainly a good phone, reviewers are hesitant to suggest it to those already in the Android or iOS market. For those already devoted to Windows phones, however, they highly recommend it. Tech Radar states, “As a device, the Lumia 950 XL...has been carved out as a tool for the purist...For the faithful, this will likely be enough to keep them going while rumours of the ‘Surface Phone’ fly around…” CNET adds, “...I’d have to say unless you’re a die-hard Windows fan then you’d have a better mobile experience from Android and iOS.. If you are a devout Lumia fan then it cannot get better than this. Windows 10 is present and correct and it has the battery power, camera and the display that, in theory, can take on the best out there.. - Richard Goodwin, Know Your Mobile. It's the best Windows 10 phone around, but it's still dogged by major performance issues.. The Lumia 950XL isn't the phone that'll bring Microsoft the sales that it's looking for. The phone lacks good design elements for the asking price and there are just not enough apps on the Windows Store to recommend the phone to anyone. A lot of work needs to be done still.. Overall the Lumia 950 XL is an exercise in futility, the OS lags and stutters in most places, not to mention the general lack of apps that will probably ever be filled at this point; meaning unfortunately the Lumia 950 XL is a very hard phone to recommend, to anyone, ever.. The Lumia 950 XL is a smartphone with good specs and great features, which can be used as a PC replacement thanks to Continuum.. Microsoft released the Lumia 950 XL on October 31, 2015.. Microsoft Lumia 950 XL prices will vary depending on retailer, age, special offers and whether or not it's purchased with a service plan. If purchased with a 2 year service contract for example, you would likely pay much less for the phone itself up front. Microsoft's suggested retail price is $499.00.

If you are a devout Lumia fan then it cannot get better than this.

The Lumia 950 XL is definitely the best Windows 10 phone available right now, but it's still not quite good enough to be a viable alternative to its Android competition. Continuum is a really attractive feature and the Lumia's camera is easily one of the best I've seen all year, but it has too many minor annoyances day-to-day holding it back to make it good value.. The Lumia 950XL isn't the phone that'll bring Microsoft the sales that it's looking for.

The phone lacks good design elements for the asking price and there are just not enough apps on the Windows Store to recommend the phone to anyone. A lot of work needs to be done still.. Very hard phone to recommend, to anyone, ever. Overall the Lumia 950 XL is an exercise in futility, the OS lags and stutters in most places, not to mention the general lack of apps that will probably ever be filled at this point; meaning unfortunately the Lumia 950 XL is a very hard phone to recommend, to anyone, ever.. Overall the Lumia 950 XL is an exercise in futility, the OS lags and stutters in most places, not to mention the general lack of apps that will probably ever be filled at this point; meaning unfortunately the Lumia 950 XL is a very hard phone to recommend, to anyone, ever..

The Lumia 950 XL is a great high-end product, which does not make any mistakes in respect of the technology. Besides a fast SoC, you get sufficient storage, which can also be expanded. The camera can convince as well and takes both great pictures and videos. Microsoft implements a new USB Type-C port that even supports the USB 3.1 standard, which is currently unique in this segment.. Microsoft's first Windows 10 smartphone is difficult to recommend.

The Microsoft Lumia 950 XL is a solid smartphone, thanks to its beautiful Quad HD AMOLED display, consistently great rear camera and smooth performance from the SnapDragon processor and 3GB of RAM. Windows 10 Mobile is a towering achievement that brings a synchronicity and coherence between your work or home computer, tablet and smartphone previously only seen in the Apple ecosystem. Windows 10 is fast, reliable and stylish.. Brilliant display, powerful processor, good cameras. It's certainly worth noting that two of the Lumia 950 XL's biggest problems - the ugly backplate and inferior OS - could be fixed before its inevitable successor is launched.

It's certainly worth noting that two of the Lumia 950 XL's biggest problems - the ugly backplate and inferior OS - could be fixed before its inevitable successor is launched. More attractive rear covers are already on sale, and Microsoft has committed to providing Windows 10 Mobile with feature and performance updates. Here's hoping that third-party support for compatible apps will improve as well.. Again Microsoft have proved with the 950 XL that they have a knack of going to the extremes when it comes to smartphones. There’s no subtle way of saying this: The 950 XL could have looked better. The design is heinous for a flagship smartphone that’s supposed to revitalise the Lumia... Again Microsoft have proved with the 950 XL that they have a knack of going to the extremes when it comes to smartphones. There’s no subtle way of saying this: The 950 XL could have looked better. The design is heinous for a flagship smartphone that’s supposed to revitalise the Lumia brand. Software wise the Windows OS has both sad and elated. I’m sad that not many developers are giving it attention and making apps for it but I’m excited due to the cross platform ease of use and mobility. Plus, Windows Hello is just plain cool, fingerprint sensors are so 2015. The performance capabilities of the 950 XL are top notch but sadly there’s nothing that can stretch those factors to the limits. The show stealer is of course the camera. I could wax eloquently for hours about the camera; it’s just amazing.. Best Windows 10 Mobile available when it comes to specs, software display quality, and the camera. Microsoft's Lumia 950 XL is the best Windows 10 Mobile available when it comes to specs, software display quality, and the camera. It has a lousy finish, however, and offers nothing to sway dedicated Android and iOS users.. Microsoft's Lumia 950 XL is the best Windows 10 Mobile available when it comes to specs, software display quality, and the camera. It has a lousy finish, however, and offers nothing to sway dedicated Android and iOS users.. An uninspired look and feel that isn't fit for a high-end smartphone in this day and age. Unfortunately, the Lumia 950 XL fails to champion Windows 10 before the better, faster, stronger competition of Android and iOS phablets. The operating system is still in need of improvement and doesn't make for the kind of polished user experience that we're used to from competing devices. The phablet itself feels undercooked, as if it was quickly put together so that the new platform would have a launch device. We fear the 950 XL is destined to be forgotten quickly after a more elaborate handset claims its media and retail presence for itself in the first half of 2016. Hopefully, it will make a better case for Windows 10's strong sides.... Unfortunately, the Lumia 950 XL fails to champion Windows 10 before the better, faster, stronger competition of Android and iOS phablets. The operating system is still in need of improvement and doesn't make for the kind of polished user experience that we're used to from competing devices. The phablet itself feels undercooked, as if it was quickly put together so that the new platform would have a launch device. We fear the 950 XL is destined to be forgotten quickly after a more elaborate handset claims its media and retail presence for itself in the first half of 2016. Hopefully, it will make a better case for Windows 10's strong sides. Still, fans of Microsoft's non-traditional approach to mobile computing, or users deep into MS's product ecosystem will have a hard time finding a more impressive Windows 10 smartphone than the Lumia 950 XL right about now. Otherwise, with its unlocked price of almost $600, the 950 XL simply lacks a killer feature that would make one go for it, instead of a superior and more reasonably priced Android device, like the Google Nexus 6P by Huawei. However, we must acknowledge that hi-end phablets that play on the same hardware field as the Lumia 950 XL usually start from $700 and up. But given the handset's serious shortcomings, we still cannot call it a bargain.. after using this phone , I understood why Nokia ceo cried..

Please help me with links to refer that will lead me buy the phone made originally by Microsoft's. I have the same question (0). You can't buy from the factory.... I don't think they still have one in China. Most Lumia's I see now are made in Viet Nam.. In reply to [Epstein]'s post on October 10, 2015. My Lumia 640 XL is also made in Vietnam. I just can't make sure what factory is that. May I be sure the equipment are originally from Microsoft? I'm actually confused as if I order it from the USA, it won't operate within Chinese network coverage.... In reply to Արմէն Սարգսեան's post on October 10, 2015. No one would know exactly which factory phones comes from. If you are so worried, buy from an authorized store.. Buy online, pick up in store.

I owned a Lumia 950 XL in India, it was good for one Month later I got problem with the Internal Mic.(Other person who is calling me or I am calling is not hearing my voice at all) i took that to a service center and they took my phone for 15 days and they. gave it yesterday and they said issue resolved. But it is NOT..!!! Not sure whether it is a Hardware issue or a Software issue does anybody came across this kind of situation?? or Only me.!!??. This is really frustrating me !! if i have to visit Service Center again then it is waste for me to wait for 15 days more!!. please help if you have any other solution to fix this problem.. I have the same question (29). Check if you have the latest system updates, and download all available. If the issue persists, download the Windows Device Recovery Tool and reset your phone.. If nothing helps, replace your phone as it may be a hardware thing and the phone is still under warranty.. I have had the same problem.. I bought the phone from the Microsoft Store Online August 4th, 2016.. I have called the support for resolution three times starting 6 days ago.. No response, other then every time I call, then tell me its been escalated, but. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Was thinking of buying a new surface, but have to now consider an Apple.. 1 person was helped by this reply. In reply to Steven BrooksATL's post on May 8, 2017. After an update, the mic problem started happening several weeks ago. The strange thing is, callers can't hear me even with a strong signal unless I use a Bluetooth or wired headset. She can type precisely what I say (without. I wonder if you experienced anything similar to me. Were you able to find a solution? Please let me know.. 15254.12 (Not resolved after a hard reset). In reply to JAD11's post on December 13, 2017. Unfortunately I was not able to find a solution. Like you callers have no problem hearing me if I use Bluetooth and I can leave voice notes with no issues. In the end I changed the phone and was not happy to do so as I liked the 950. In reply to LisaFernandez_13's post on December 20, 2017. After resetting my phone and trouble shooting with a number or sources I had my mic checked by the repairman that fixed my screen. After adjusting the mic the problem was corrected.. Buy online, pick up in store.
