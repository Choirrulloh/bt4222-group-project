Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Quad-core, 1500 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm.

more ... more .... more ... more .... by Preslav Kateliev. Android - Android + Sony - Sony +. 1 Sony Xperia L2 Review. Earlier this year, Sony introduced one of its most affordable phones in recent history. The new Sony Xperia L2 is an entry-level offering that folows the company's familiar styling principles, but also one that carries some new bells and whistles, such as a 120-degree wide-angle selfie camera and a fingerprint scanner that works on the US model as well. The Xperia L2 is launching on February 9th for the retail price of $249.99, which puts it in the same category with low-tier devices, and well below the more shiny offerings like the Xperia XA2. Now let's take a look at it and see if it is worth getting one! Design Looks okay and feels solid, but won't turn any heads The Xperia L2 sports the typical Sony look, but with a twist — the stark rectangle on the front, the softly rounded frame, and the flap-drawer for the SIM and microSD cards on the side are all familiar, but we now get a curved back as well, allowing the device to rest better in our palm. It's a plastic build, but a matte finish gives it a very convincing metal look. The device won't be turning any heads, and its thick side bezels are a telltale sign of a budget offering, but that's not to say it's ugly. It falls perfectly in the "It's OK" category. In terms of hardware controls, we have the plastic power button and volume rocker on the right side. They feel quite nice — with no excessive wobble, and a solid click gives us all the feedback we would need from a button. On the back we have the fingerprint reader, which does its job plenty fast. There is no hardware button for the camera, which upper-range Xperia phones do have, but fret not — a quick double-press on the power button acts as a camera shortcut. Display Bland, blue, and dim The Xperia L2 sports a 5.5-inch screen with the good-old 16:9 aspect ratio. Its resolution is 720 x 1280 pixels, which means we've got a density of about 267 pixels per inch. This doesn't sound great on paper, but we found that if we didn't go pixel-peeping, we weren't bothered by the resolution. We've often seen Xperia phones with screens that are way too cold for our liking, and the Xperia L2 is no different. We measured its color temperature to be 8102 K, far from the 6000 reference value, and the blue tint is certainly visible. Thankfully, there are RGB sliders in the phone 's settings, allowing you to tinker with the color balance. Once that's been fine tuned, you will be met by a display with tame colors that don't try to melt your eyes. The screen's brightness is disappointingly low — we measured 370 nits at maximum brightness, and that showed in our real-world use. Consuming media when the ambience around you is bright is a tough task. But content is still visible enough under the sun if you need to answer a phone call or take a picture. Interface and Functionality A Sony is a Sony Sony's interface has been built on the same principles for years now — a light reskin of Android with no extreme amount of added features or background processes to bog the device down, a few new visuals and widgets, and Sony's signature apps. So, aside from the stock Android apps, we've got the Movie Creator which allows you to choose a bunch of photos and clips and have the phone generate a highlights video for you, we've got the PlayStation app pre-installed so you can sync with your console profile, we've got the Xperia Lounge which sends you vouchers, offers, and app suggestions, and a Theme Store. The Xperia X2 ships with Android 7.1.1 out of the box — disappointingly, not Android 8 Oreo — and makes full use of the stock features in Google 's operating system. We've got split screen, we've got the Google feed screen on the left, and we've got the Google Assistant, of course. The app shortcuts, which appear when you tap and hold on an app, are present as well. Hardware and performance The Xperia L2 is powered by a MediaTek 6737T — a quad-core SoC that ticks at 1.5 GHz — and has 3 GB of RAM. For day-to-day tasks, the hardware performs well. We had no issues with chats or browsing. Some choppiness is observable when using Snapchat Lenses or when caching a 60 FPS YouTube video, but nothing to make the phone unusable. As for games, it depends on what you're playing, really. A simple tap-action game like Break Liner ran great on the Xperia L2. Shadow Fight 3, which is a round-based fighter with 3D models, also ran smoothly. Then, we upped the ante to Rules of Survival — a PUBG-like massive online survival shooter. Here, the phone showed its low-end nature by dropping some frames and disadvantaging us in fights. Our impression is that the Xperia L2 does the basic smartphone tasks well enough and can entertain you as long as you respect its limits. Just don't expect to throw heavy games and apps at it and have it perform flawlessly. You get 32GB of built-in storage with the Xperia L2, but only about 23GB are actually available for your apps and media. For those who need extra gigs, a microSD card is available. Camera The Xperia L2's Camera app is kind of a barebones edition of what you'd find on the more powerful Sony phones. We've got the signature Sony Intelligent Auto mode, a rather limited Manual mode, and Video mode. There's also object tracking when you tap on the screen, which is quite nice to see on a phone of this class. The camera on the back has a 13 MP sensor with 1.12μm pixels and an F2.0 lens aperture. It does a fine job at capturing details without too much grain, which we appreciate. Still, don't expect a super-sharp image. Colors are balanced and fairly accurate. We'd say the camera only seems to have an issue with some shades of green, as can be seen in the grass on photo 6. However, dynamic range is noticeably narrow as we will often lose parts of a photo either to overburned highlights or blacked-out shadows. This is very noticeable indoors, but can also be an issue outside on cloudy days — photos 3 and 28 are good examples. As far as nighttime photography goes... well, don't expect miracles (photos 30, 31, 32). The selfie camera has a 120-degree wide-angle lens to allow you to fit more stuff in your selfies. There is a normal mode, which zooms into the middle of the image, cropping out the fisheye effect around the sides. Behind this lens, we have an 8 MP sensor, which we find to be doing a good job when it comes to details in both wide-angle and regular modes. Its colors are a bit skewed, but that's nothing too dramatic. The issue with overblowing highlights remains here, but as long as you keep your face in the shade, you can take well-acceptable selfies. Now, while the Auto mode can recognize backlighting and try to compensate for it in some way, if you really need to squish the dynamics with HDR, you need to go into Manual mode, open its settings, and turn on the HDR toggle. Yeah, it's a bit annoying that it's hidden behind two different taps. As far as video capture goes, the continuous focus can help if you are recording an action scene. But keep in mind there's next to no stabilization on the clips, so try not to move around too much. The maximum video quality the phone can go to is 1080p at 30 FPS. But hey, it gets the job done for Facebook clips. Connectivity The Xperia L2 sports a USB Type-C port, which is nice to see on such an affordable phone. Some manufacturers still skimp here, putting the old Micro USB port on their devices, making them feel less modern. On the cellular end, we've got LTE support over a broad range of LTE bands, though there's no CDMA support. If you are buying the phone unlocked in the US, you'll be only able to use it with GSM carriers, such as AT&T or T-Mobile. Multimedia As we mentioned earlier, the phone's display is a bit weak on brightness and not the best in colors, so it won't be blowing you away when watching clips and pictures. But we've found that, depending on the media viewed, it can still be an enjoyable experience. On the audio side, we've got a single speaker on the bottom of the phone, and it just sounds tinny. It does the job for ringtones and alarms, but not so much for media. But Sony has installed a software EQ on the phone, which we appreciate, especially when we connect the phone to a Bluetooth speaker or a set of earphones. FM radio fans will be happy to know that there's a radio app on the Xperia L2, which is accessible even in Ultra Stamina Mode (power saving). Battery life Sony keeps passing the 1-day threshold Sony made a name for itself as a battery life king in 2014, with the Xperia Z2 and Xperia Z3. The signature Stamina Mode was well ahead of its time, putting power-saving features on the phone well before Android got them as a stock feature. Nowadays, Stamina Mode is quite simplified, which is not necesarrily a bad thing. Sony also adds an extra tier of power saving called Ultra Stamina. It basically turns off most features and disables most apps, making the L2 more like a feature phone. But that extends the battery life tremendously. The Xperia L2 held out for 7 hours and 50 minutes on our battery life test, which is not a champion's result, but still a serviceable one. Combine that with Stamina Mode and we'd say one can reach a day and a half of battery life with this device. That goes especially if it is used as the modest phone that it is — basic tasks, no 3D gaming. Conclusion So, let's sum this up. What do $250 get you? First and foremost, the Sony Xperia L2 is an affordable, entry-level Android phone that covers all of the bases a phone of this class should, but it has its drawbacks and limitations. For instance, it offers a large display, but has a cheap-ish look due to its thick bezels and unimpressive display qualities. Its performance with everyday smartphone tasks — from connectivity to watching clips — is solid, but heavy gaming could be a challenge. The back-mounted fingerprint scanner is nice having and it works as fast as the competition. The camera gets the job done, but is nothing to write home about. All in all, the Xperia L2 performs well enough for that kind of money. But just to throw a curveball out there — the Motorola Moto G5S Plus starts at $280. It sports a metal body, a no-less-capable camera on the back and a selfie camera with a LED flash, a more powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 chip under the hood, and a battery that performed better in our battery life test. All that said, if you are looking for a low-cost, entry-level phone, be it a Sony or not, it looks like the Xperia L2 could be it, or at least until better options come out on the market in a few months.. 5.91 x 3.07 x 0.39 inches. 150 x 78 x 9.8 mm. 6.04 x 3 x 0.37 inches. 153.5 x 76.2 x 9.5 mm. 6.06 x 2.98 x 0.33 inches. 154 x 75.8 x 8.4 mm. 6.16 x 2.96 x 0.3 inches. 156.5 x 75.3 x 7.6 mm.

The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software..

Even their entry level phone is having a fingerprint scanner, making all Sony phones are having biometric security on board. If Xperia L2 is priced properly, let say, around previous Xperia L1 price, then this phone would be worth a consideration. Anyway, Low End midrange Xperia XA2 is much more better with Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 on board, rather than this Mediatek phone.. Want to comment? Please login or register ..

This is a budget option that’ll likely come with a low price-tag and cheap contract options, but is there anything to get excited about?. Sony hasn’t set a price for the Xperia L2, but it should hit shelves towards the end of January.. Like most of Sony’s phones, the Xperia L2 isn’t the best-looking device out there. It’s not ugly, but the thickness of the bezel above and below the display, along with the plastic body, does little to make it stand out.. It does have a fingerprint scanner on the back, which is not a given at the low end, but I wasn’t able to fully test it out to see how fast it was. With all the free space on the front, though, it does feel a bit weird that the fingerprint sensor couldn’t have been below the screen on the front.. There’s a 5.5-inch display with an HD 720p resolution that isn’t the sharpest, but it looks to be tuned well with nice colours and decent viewing angles. You can always count on Sony phones to have a nice screen regardless of price, and that continues here.. Under the plastic body is a basic MediaTek CPU and a surprising 3GB of RAM. Small amounts of RAM can often cause big problems on cheap phones, but that shouldn’t be the case here. Don’t expect the Xperia L2 to manage graphically intensive games, but it should be fine for basic day-to-day bits. There’s also 32GB storage and a microSD slot for expanding that.. While the XA2 and XA2 Ultra ship with Android Oreo, the Xperia L2 is stuck with the older Android 7.0. This is a shame and shows that Sony is focusing more attention on its higher-end devices. Hopefully we’ll see an Oreo update at some point, but that wasn’t confirmed.. A 3300mAh battery should keep the phone running all day, while there’s a 13MP camera on the back. I wasn’t particularly impressed by the speed of the snapper, nor its autofocus, but these are the sacrifices you have to make at this price. Round the front there’s a 120-degree wide-angle 8MP selfie camera.. If Sony prices the Xperia L2 right, it could be a decent first phone or a good choice if you just need something basic. The decent amount of RAM and storage is nice, but the camera might not be the best.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

The design of the Xperia L2 doesn't deviate from the classic, iconic lines of Sony's Omnibalance design. The smartphone has a plastic frame and. But don't expect a nice polished glass-like polycarbonate, it's a plain plastic that feels anything but premium in the palm of your hand.. As soon as I began testing the device, I immediately noticed that if you press on the back of the device, the thin plastic bends inwards until it touches the non-removable battery inside. The curvature of the back of the device makes it a bit more ergonomic, but it leaves an empty space above the battery.. The smartphone is also large for a 5.5-inch device, which is. when you hold it in your hand due to the huge bezels. design combined with these large bezels. In spite of this, the fingerprint reader is positioned so that it can be easily reached with the index finger. Though, it's a pity that it is one of the slowest scanners. I've had the opportunity to test for a long time.. The 5.5-inch IPS display is protected with Gorilla Glass 4. The panel only has HD resolution, which is disappointing given the price of this device. As you'll find out as you read on, this isn't the only spec that doesn't live up to the price tag.. What is Gorilla Glass? Know the differences between each version. I found the display's brightness to be inadequate, particularly in the sun. The fact that the light sensor is slow to detect ambient light and make adjustments did not help. perfectly fine, even if the blacks aren't as deep as you might find on an OLED panel. The viewing angles of the display are good, and none of the blacks turned to gray as often happens with LCD panels in this range.. with a special device, the Spyder Elite 5, to objectively measure its characteristics.. The color representation isn't so bad,. but the maximum brightness is too low.. In addition, the display lacks contrast, with a result of only 806:1.. Complete data are available in the table below:. Despite the fact that the Xperia L2 was presented in January 2018, the device comes with Android 7.1.1 Nougat and a security patch as old as November 2017. This wasn't a great move on Sony's part, but this may have been the fault of the MediaTek SoC.. As we know, the company's other devices presented from IFA onwards already have Android Oreo. Even the Xperia XA2 and XA2 Ultra run Android 8.0 Oreo , and they were launched at the same time as the L2 at CES .. As for the rest, the software is classic for Sony: lean, fast and clean. It's too bad the hardware can't keep up.. A Snapdragon 400 series would definitely have been a better choice than the 1.5GHZ quad-core Mediatek MT6737T with ARM Cortex-A53 architecture.. The 3 GB of RAM is more than enough, but the smartphone's CPU cannot keep up with basic software functions like. animations or switching between the various open apps. Performance when scrolling content such as simple PDFs or system settings is good, but don't try to go too fast. while browsing your Facebook or your Instagram feed. The 32 GB of eMMC internal memory is more than enough and can be expanded with a MicroSD card.. The audio experience using the Xperia L2 with headphones is fine. The smartphone still has the much-loved 3.5 mm headphone jack and features some small software goodies already found on other Sony smartphones like ClearAudio+, the equalizer and a function that normalizes audio between tracks to avoid sudden, jarring changes in volume.. There is the AptX Bluetooth audio codec, but. no AptXHD or LDAC as usually present in the latest smartphones of the Japanese company.. Don't expect any miracles from the speaker, as the volume doesn't get very loud and the quality is uneven. The sound is flat and lacks bass, plus there's distortion at high volumes. In addition, the position of the speaker on the bottom of the phone makes it easy to cover if you're holding the device horizontally to watch a video, for example.. The main camera is 13 MP and has a size of 1/3.1". The lens has an aperture of f/2.0, but it's not the best on the market. The Xperia L2 is capable to shooting video at 1080p and 30 fps, which is enough for social media and sporadic use. The front camera is 8 MP and it has an aperture of f/2.4.. The camera takes shots that are just passable for Snapchat or quick texts to a friend, but nothing more than that. The photos lack detail, and even in excellent lighting conditions, the results come out dark. Autofocus is quick, but don't expect to be able to catch fast-moving subjects.. The 3,300 mAh battery is huge given that the Xperia L2 has a dim, low resolution screen and a weak CPU. You can safely go two days without charging, perhaps due in part to the fact that the phone's performance doesn't inspire a lot of use. With moderate use and activating airplane mode at night, it's possible to have a long weekend without bringing a charger along.. In our test with the PCMark Battery Work 2.0 benchmark, the smartphone lasted 9 hours and 34 minutes - far surpassing smartphones like the OnePlus 5T (5:45) and the Sony Xperia XZ Premium (7:05).. Charging is done using USB Type-C, but there is no fast charging and the port is USB 2.0, so data transfer to and from a PC is less than optimal.. 150 x 78 x 9.7 mm. 1280 x 720 pixels (267 ppi). My primary criticism of the smartphone is. Entry-level smartphones like this can satisfy many users and perform basic functions without batting an eye, but the Sony Xperia L2 is priced like a mid-range smartphone so we have to evaluate it like one. For $249 or even less, there are many alternatives, like the Honor 7X , whose build quality and specs are far superior.. If the Xperia L2 were to drop below $180, it could be a good choice for users with few demands and a small budget. As things stand right now though, it would be crazy to buy a smartphone with these specs for such a high price.. lol i've never seen anyone run a test like this on the screen of an entry-level phone. in fact, i've never seen any reviewer do that for any device. it's usually sufficient to state, "the colors look good/bad". what warranted a review on this device?. Embarrassing unrealistic expectations of an entry level phone. Its competitors don't even have fingerprint scanners, you you downrate this for it being slower than premium phones You are the laughing stock of the internet, thankfully your readers aren't as dumb. The L2 hits a great sweet spot for the price!. Your review of this phone is like you're reviewing a $700 phone. Yes I see the short comings you mentioned but 250? Really? You compare it to the honor 7x which lacks NFC and is probably filled with China spyware. It also probably has some kind of wack tempered glass like honor phones off the past. But yes I wouldn't buy a phones under 400 bucks anyway.. The pixel resolution is beyond the eye's ability to pick out without magnification and the material reviewing for the most part isn't 2K or 4K so it's not a particular issue. You've been deceived by the Numbers race.. This idea the plastic "feels" bad and so affects quality is a stupid idea that is not reflective of reality. It's strong it's tough It's durable and it happens to be inexpensive. I don't know but that sure sounds premium to me. Quality isn't about feel, quality is about performance. And plastic outperforms aluminum and glass for phone backs in every single way that you can measure. Your subjective joy in glass and aluminum is not a sign of quality but just of what you like. When you measure the kind of wear and abuse it can take and still look good, plastic wins. Similarly dinging and noisy vibration motor. do you understand what sound is. you can't make a vibration motor that is quiet. If you wanted to get quantitative about it then you should be measuring decibels on every phone making a real measurement not just an opinion..

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Hands on: Sony Xperia L2 review. A low-cost handset with some solid specs. What is a hands on review?. A potentially decent budget buy with a sizable screen and fingerprint scanner, if the price is right. The design may not dazzle, but the Xperia L2 has enough about it to keep things interesting.. Sony Xperia L2 Ultra price and release date Design and display Camera Power, OS and battery Early verdict New year, new tech – check out all our coverage of CES 2018 straight from Las Vegas, the greatest gadget show on Earth. The Sony Xperia L2 is a cheap Android smartphone that offers a reasonable set of features, but it's not going to blow you away.. Announced at CES 2018 , the Sony XperiaL2 comes with a 5.5-inch 720p HD display, Mediatek chipset, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, microSD slot, fingerprint scanner, 13MP rear camera and 8MP front snapper.. The Sony Xperia L2 Ultra release date was originally set for the end of January, but that has now been pushed back to February 9 in the US. We've yet to hear word from Sony on when it'll be launching in the UK or Australia.. In the US the price is also set at $249.99 (about £175, AU$310) and we'll update this hands on review as soon as we know more about the cost and availability in the UK and Australia.. The Sony Xperia L2 isn't the best looking phone we've seen, but it's practically built with a solid plastic shell making it feel durable.. The power/lock and volume keys are located on the right of the handset and are easy to hit.. At 150 x 78 x 9.8mm, you can just about use the the Xperia L2 with one hand, but if your palms are on the small side you may need to use both.. The rear facing fingerprint scanner is conveniently placed too, but it's a shame to see such a big bezel below the screen with no navigation keys or scanners housed in it. It feels like Sony could have given us a bit more screen.. On the note of the display, the Xperia L2 has a bright and clear, 720p HD screen which is a solid offering.. The Sony Xperia L2 packs a 13MP rear facing camera, which we found provides a relatively standard shooting experience.. It's not the quickest on shutter speed, and low light shots seem to be a little muddy, but for a cheap handset it appears to be an adequate offering.. Round the front the Xperia L2 gets the same wide-angle, 120 degree field of view 8MP camera as the Xperia XA2 Ultra. It means you'll be able to squeeze more of your friends in each selfie snap.. There's a decent amount of power under the hood with 3GB of RAM working alongside the MediaTek processor.. The disappointing aspect is the software, with the Xperia L2 launch with Android 7 Nougat, rather than the newer Android 8 Oreo. It makes us wonder if it will get an upgrade to Oreo in the future or not.. Performance during our brief time with the phone was good, but you'll have to wait for our full review to find out how it really gets on.. There's a decent size power pack inside the Xperia L2, with a 3,300mAh battery.. The success of the Sony Xperia L2 rests on its price point. So far the US pricing seems about right, and pitched at the right level it could be a fantastic budget buy. The competition at this end of the market is fierce though and it'll have its work cut out to stand out.. What is a hands on review?.

Sony Xperia L2 leaked in 3D render video with (slightly) new design. by Scott Adam Gordon January 2, 2018. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. A leaked render video for the Sony Xperia L2 has appeared online giving us a look at the rumored handset. The device features the same “large” bezels common on recent Sony devices, but bucks another Sony trend with its curved rear. Current rumored specs include a 5.5-inch display with HD resolution, Snapdragon 630 chipset, and 4 GB of RAM. Sony struggled (or didn’t even try) to match the latest flagship phones from other manufacturers in 2017 in terms of design. Slim bezels are in, but Sony has been sticking to design principles it’s had for the last few years, namely, phones with square edgesÂ. and big upper and lower bezels.. And it’s a trend that looks like will mostly continue in 2018, if leaks regarding its next devices are anything to go by. We’ve caught a glimpse at the XA 2 Ultra earlier today and now we’ve got a look at the potential design of another new Sony device, the Xperia L2, via a CAD render video.. CAD renders of the Sony Xperia XA2 and Xperia XA2 Ultra leak. Earlier today we brought you some leaked pics of the Xperia XA2 Ultra, and now we're getting a peek at some leaked CAD renderings of the device.. The XA2 will actually come in â¦. CompareRaja and @OnLeaks produced the leak, and it reveals an angular device with a curved rear and single rear camera sensor. This curved rear approach is a slight change in direction for Sony (though it wouldn’t be the first Sony handset to have such a design ), which has used a flat back on most its smartphones for the past few years. that the handset will be filled with a large battery, but with most manufacturers aiming towards thinner devices with smaller bezels, this could be viewed as a step in the wrong direction for the Japanese manufacturer.. Meanwhile, it also looks like the handset will house the headphone jack missing from some modern devices,Â. a fingerprint scanner and USB Type-C connectivity.. Alongside the render video arrived a handful of potential L2 specs which include a 5.5-inch, HD (1280 Ã 720 pixels) display, Snapdragon 630 chipset, and 4 GB of RAM (it’s also probably going to miss out on Oreo though and instead be running Android Nougat ). As or the device’s dimensions, these are expected to come in at 149.9 mm x 78.4 mm x 9.8 mm.. The original Sony Xperia L1 was first unveiled at MWC 2017 and was released later that year to replace the Xperia E series; like that handset, the L2 should be another reasonably inexpensive device (the first gen model went on sale for $199).. It’s possible that the L2 will be revealed at CES 2018 this week, though, like its predecessor, it may not appear until MWC at the end of February.Â.

Review Junkies We review it, you read it.. Previous LG OLED W8 Signature Series. Next Sneaky Bears Official Launch Trailer. Sony Xperia L2 Ultra price and release date. New year, new tech – check out all our coverage of CES 2018 straight from Las Vegas, the greatest gadget show on Earth. The Sony Xperia L2 is a cheap Android smartphone that offers a reasonable set of features, but it's not going to blow you away.. Announced at CES 2018 , the Sony XperiaL2 comes with a 5.5-inch 720p HD display, Mediatek chipset, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, microSD slot, fingerprint scanner, 13MP rear camera and 8MP front snapper.. The Sony Xperia L2 Ultra release date is set for the end of January, but there's currently no word on price.. We'll update this hands on review as soon as we know more about the cost and availability.. The Sony Xperia L2 isn't the best looking phone we've seen, but it's practically built with a solid plastic shell making it feel durable.. The power/lock and volume keys are located on the right of the handset and are easy to hit.. At 150 x 78 x 9.8mm, you can just about use the the Xperia L2 with one hand, but if your palms are on the small side you may need to use both.. The rear facing fingerprint scanner is conveniently placed too, but it's a shame to see such a big bezel below the screen with no navigation keys or scanners housed in it. It feels like Sony could have given us a bit more screen.. On the note of the display, the Xperia L2 has a bright and clear, 720p HD screen which is a solid offering.. The Sony Xperia L2 packs a 13MP rear facing camera, which we found provides a relatively standard shooting experience.. It's not the quickest on shutter speed, and low light shots seem to be a little muddy, but for a cheap handset it appears to be an adequate offering.. Round the front the Xperia L2 gets the same wide-angle, 120 degree field of view 8MP camera as the Xperia XA2 Ultra. It means you'll be able to squeeze more of your friends in each selfie snap.. There's a decent amount of power under the hood with 3GB of RAM working alongside the MediaTek processor.. The disappointing aspect is the software, with the Xperia L2 launch with Android 7 Nougat, rather than the newer Android 8 Oreo. It makes us wonder if it will get an upgrade to Oreo in the future or not.. Performance during our brief time with the phone was good, but you'll have to wait for our full review to find out how it really gets on.. There's a decent size power pack inside the Xperia L2, with a 3,300mAh battery.. The success of the Sony Xperia L2 rests on its price point. Pitched at the right level and it could be a fantastic budget buy, but the competition at this end of the market is fierce and it'll have its work cut out to stand out.. Tags L2 Sony Xperia.

Vishal Toshiwal February 6, 2018 0 Mobiles Sony Xperia L2: Could this smartphone help Sony stand out in crowd? What could be the reason for the decrease in demand for Sony Xperia phones in India? Here’s the highlight of the Sony Xperia L2 specifications: What is the verdict on Sony Xperia L2?. Sony could have done a better job when they planned to release their latest selfie-centric smartphone yesterday. On Monday, the Japanese brand launched their Sony Xperia L2 smartphone in India at a ludicrous price tag of Rs 19,990. Could Sony have priced it worse!. The brand that was once loved in the country for its iconic Xperia Z Series is struggling to make it in the market. May it be flagship, mid, and entry-level, there is no single handset in current Xperia range that has got good response among smartphone users in India.. It’s not as complex as a Sony loyal fan might think. It’s rather simple! When you think from the perspective of the average Indian smartphone consumer you’d understand it clearly. Meaning when an average smartphone consumer in India goes for smartphone shopping. > First thing is that it should be affordable! Cuz Indians at large don’t believe in spending too much on an item like a smartphone. Surely, the purchasing power over the years has been an increase, but they seek value in spending.. Which brings to the second thing!. > On top of being affordable, the smartphone should deliver an amazing set of specifications that may include latest trending features and best-in-class hardware specifications.. These are the two ingredients absent from the Sony Xperia L2 specifications.. > A large 5.5-inch screen with 16:9 ratio instead of 18:9 ratio. Poor HD resolution makes its display unappealing.. > Of course, it offers decent 3GB RAM and 32GB storage with expansion support via microSD card. But a MediaTek processor, which can’t even beat budget-friendly Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor in terms of performance.. > 13MP rear camera with f/2.0 and 8MP selfie camera with the 120-degree Super-wide angle. Overall, the camera package isn’t quite the standout at the hefty price it retails.. > A 3300 mAh capacity battery is decent, but not quite extraordinary. When phones with 5-inches come packed with 4000 mAh capacity battery, it’s really a poor choice when a large screen smartphone comes with a low capacity battery.. If you still believe that above specifications are good enough for the price tag it comes. Then, you might be living under the rock when handsets like…. These handsets offer way better VFM (value for money) than Sony Xperia L2 price and specifications.. It’s not that Sony Xperia L2 specifications make it a poor device in terms of design, display, performance, camera, and battery life. But the point that the company shouldn’t charge way too much money for it. Considering the current standards in the market, these specifications are seen on the entry-level smartphones priced below 10,000. That’s twice the amount Sony Xperia L2 is priced at. Sony should tread lightly, otherwise, one day they won’t have even loyal fans.. Previous article Infinix S Series: Could there be a better selfie phone out there?.

Home » Reviews » Sony Xperia L2 Review. Ankeet Solanki February 21, 2018 Leave a comment. Design Display Performance Battery & Audio Camera Final line. Last year, Sony launched Xperia L1 , it was an entry-level smartphone with a MediaTek processor. And at the CES 2018 in Las Vegas came to the second generation, Xperia L2, which has been priced at $249.98 / £169.99 and compared to its predecessor, it has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of native storage. The other features remained more or less unchanged, let’s find out more in this Sony Xperia L2 review.. Ergonomics is definitely not the strong point of the Xperia L2 weighing around 180 grams and has a thickness of 9.8mm. The first impression, visually all are good at it. The design is pleasant, however, It seems that high-quality materials are not used. The housing is made of plastic as well as the rear part which also retains enough impressions.. In addition, the curvature of the rear panel creates a slight space below the fingerprint sensor that once discovered becomes a bit annoying.. On the right side, there are the volume keys and the power button. On the opposite side, there is a slot for the nano-SIM card and for a microSD card with which we can expand the integrated memory. On the bottom edge, there are the USB 2.0 Type-C port and the speaker along with the main microphone. On the top edge, we find the second microphone and the 3.5mm audio jack.. The front is protected by a Corning Gorilla Glass 4. At the top are the proximity sensor, an 8-megapixel camera, and a small RGB notification LED.. A 5.5-inch IPS LCD display with HD resolution and a pixel density of 267ppi. The panel used by Sony is not exactly the same as that seen on Xperia L1. This display offers a good contrast, thanks to fairly markedly blacks, but not very accurate colors and not a very high brightness that penalize the visibility in more attentive lighting conditions.. Sony Xperia L2 is powered by Mediatek MT6737T quad-core processor clocked at 1.45GHz (slightly more advanced than Xperia L1) with a 28nm production process and Mali-T720MP2 600MHz GPU paired with 3GB of RAM. It has 32GB of internal storage which can be further expanded by up to 256GB using microSD card.. A fairly dated processor, so Xperia L2 manages to achieve all in all acceptable performance. Regularly used applications start quite quickly but are not fluid in the timeline scroll. Even the user interface, shows some slight slowdown. From the graphics point of view, you can play most of the games without too much trouble but, of course, do not expect a high fluidity.. To complete the hardware compartment we have the dual-band Wi-Fi a / b / g / n, Bluetooth 4.2 and also the NFC. The USB port, as mentioned, is a Type-C. There is also a GPS receiver with GLONASS and also a comfortable stereo FM radio.. It’s still running on Android 7.1.1 Nougat operating system. Likely to be updated to Oreo in the reasonable time since Sony already has several devices on the market updated to the latest release of the Google operating platform. The user interface is as usual classic Sony style, very close to stock Android, only with some slight customization.. (Also see Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra Review ). A simple interface that we personally appreciate very much. As standard, we find several pre-installed applications including Movie Creator, AVG Protection, and Sketch. Also the multimedia applications from Sony such as Music, Album, and Video in addition to the PlayStation and News applications.. The Sony Xperia L2 comes with LTE support and Sony has also made a Dual SIM variant too. The audio quality is good, clean and a high enough volume. However, in speakerphone, we can notice slight distortion. While playing music the volume is high, but the bass tone is almost completely missing.. Coming to the battery, it has a 3300mAh integrated battery that will allow us to use this Xperia L2 intensely for a full day, even reaching 6/7 hours of active display. In case of need, we can also increase its juice with STAMINA power saving mode. A sore point is the absence of fast charging.. The camera of the Sony Xperia L2 has not really convinced us, even if we talk about a medium / low-end smartphone. The rear camera has a 13-megapixel sensor with autofocus and f/2.0 aperture, the front one is an 8-megapixel fixed focus with f/2.4 aperture. The camera interface is same as other Sony’s devices, although not complete with some features that we find on the high-end Xperia phones.. Through the rear camera, in good lighting conditions, there is always little detail, considerable noise and a tendency to overexpose in the most illuminated areas. The dynamic range, on the other hand, we found it quite wide.. In poor lighting conditions, the situation gets worse, but not as far as one could imagine. The detail remains always low, but there is not a particular increase in noise. The front camera can capture sufficient quality pictures. Even for videos, the subject does not change. Little defined and tend to overexpose.. The Sony Xperia L2, as mentioned at the beginning, it is available for $249.98 / £169.99 on Amazon. A price is slightly high compared to other devices on the market, at even lower prices, are able to offer better hardware and also a better user experience.. Coming to technical aspects, Sony Xperia L2 seemed very promising, but in daily use did not satisfy us. First of all, ergonomics: it’s really inconvenient to use. The general performance and the quality of the photos are also not very convincing..
