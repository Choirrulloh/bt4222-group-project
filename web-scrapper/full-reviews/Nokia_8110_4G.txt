CNET también está disponible en español.. Nokia 8110 4G reboots the phone from 'The Matrix'. The classic '90s "banana phone" is back with 4G and apps on board. February 25, 2018 7:29 AM PST. Nokia 8110 4G specs Smart Feature OS Dual-core 1.1GHz Qualcomm 205 processor 512MB RAM 4GB internal storage 2.4-inch, 320x240-pixel display Micro-USB charging port Micro SIM 3.5mm headphone jack 1,500 mAh battery. Smartphones are cool and all, but sometimes you just want to answer a call by pressing a button and having your phone snap open. Sometimes you just want to pretend you're in " The Matrix ".. Welcome back, then, the Nokia 8110 4G, a new, updated version of the classic 20-year-old phone.. The original banana phone is back.. First launched in 1996, the original Nokia 8110 popularised the "slider" phone -- and of course, in 1999, it appeared in the iconic Keanu Reeves sci-fi action movie "The Matrix".. We got our first look at the rebooted classic alongside a deluge of new phones from Nokia and other manufacturers at annual phone fiesta MWC in Barcelona. This new model is the second revival of a classic Nokia phone, following last year's upgraded Nokia 3310 .. Like the original 8110, you can answer calls on the new 8110 4G by flicking open the case, and hang up by snapping it shut -- which is, for anyone who wasn't around in the '90s, the most satisfying thing.. The classic model's curved case also earned the nickname "banana phone", which Nokia alludes to in the bright yellow colour of the new model. Or you can go for a black option if your tastes are less banana, more Keanu.. Speaking of colour, the original monochrome screen is upgraded to a 2.4-inch colour screen running the same visual interface as the new Nokia 3310. It's not Android, but it does have an app store with a Facebook app available and more on the cards. You can import Gmail and Outlook contacts and check your email.. A fruity phone to bowl you over.. If the screen is too small for more involved tasks, you can also use the phone as a 4G wireless hotspot to tether your tablet or laptop.. For phone fans of a certain age this will always be the Matrix phone, but it's probably more practical for those looking for a durable low-cost phone that doesn't need to be charged every 5 minutes. So the emphasis is on battery life, going more than 20 days between charges or 8 hours of making calls.. Extras include an FM radio, 2-megapixel camera and the slippery game Snake.. The new 8110 4G will be available around May for around 79 euros, which works out to about $100, £70 or AU$125, though final pricing for the US, UK and Australia is yet to be announced..

You are here: Home Nokia Nokia 8110 4G review (hands-on): The One phone you'll buy this year?. whatsapp facebook twitter google+ linkedin reddit email. Nokia 8110 4G review: Specifications, price and release date Display 2.4in QVGA Processor Dual-core 1.1GHz Qualcomm MSM890 RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Battery life 20-day standby, 8hr talk time (4G) Price €79 Release date May 2018 Nokia 8110 4G review: Design, key features and first impressions Nokia 8110 4G review: Early verdict. Since Finnish startup HMD bought the Nokia brand from Microsoft a remarkable 70 million Nokia phones have been sold worldwide, partly driven (I'd like to think) by the interest generated by the return of the cult Nokia 3110 last year .. READ NEXT: MWC 2018 highlights. Flush with the success of the last 12 months, Nokia is at it again, this time with another famous phone, the Nokia 8110 - best known for its outing in the opening scenes to classic 1990s sci-fi flick: The Matrix.. The idea is similar to last year. Take a cult phone of yesteryear, bung some new technology in it and hope that the warm retro glow drives a few sales - and in the process a lot of awareness. HMD is also hoping the 8110 will sell for a different reason in 2018: because it’s actually useful.. READ NEXT: Nokia 8 Sirocco review - Nokia's "special edition" flagship looks lovely but lacks substance. The clue is in the name: the Nokia 8110 is a 4G phone. Now, you might wonder what the point of this is on a handset with a tiny 2.4in QVGA (320 x 240) non-touch enabled display. What Nokia wants its customers to do with the new 8110 4G is to use it as a 4G hotspot.. Fair enough but, given 99.9% of phones have this feature built in, I still think it’s a bit of a stretch. Better to think of it as a festival phone – or perhaps a phone you might hand over to your kids if you want them to be contactable but don’t trust them with a smartphone yet. Well, maybe not, because the phone has a Snake and a Facebook app pre-installed – so plenty of opportunity for timewasting there.. Huawei Matebook X Pro review (hands on): MacBook killer has a 91% screen to body ratio. Nokia 8 Sirocco review (hands-on): Sultry new design but not much substance. As for the design, that’s pretty much in keeping with the original “banana phone”. It’s curved and, well, banana shaped and there’s a cover that extends to reveal the phone’s numeric keypad. In a bizarre move, though, this isn’t spring-loaded like on the original (the mechanism adds unnecessary bulk and weight says HMD), so you won’t be emulating Neo’s famous opening scene with perfect accuracy.. What you do get here is 1990s levels of battery life. Nokia is claiming 20 days standby and eight of talk time on 4G networks, which is considerably more than even the best smartphones can manage. And because it doesn’t have a massive, super-bright touchscreen on it, you won’t be continually checking your social media feeds on it or preening yourself for pouty self-portraits, so it’s actually likely to last multiple days of actual real-world use.. Unless you’re training to break the Snake world record, of course.. It’s as hard to know what to make of the Nokia 8110 4G this year as it was the Nokia 3110 12 months ago. Despite the flush of Snake and Neo-driven nostalgia, I’m struggling to think of a reason why I’d spend. €79 (~£70) on one of these when I can pick up a perfectly competent, proper smartphone for the same or even less money. And, yes, even smartphones this cheap can do 4G and hotspot tethering these days.. Sure, it’s good to see a manufacturer try something different and I can see some people who might be tempted by one of these. It might be good if you’re attempting a soft digital detox. But mostly this seems to be a phone designed to draw attention to Nokia’s shiny new Android phones, most of which actually seem to be quite good..

That song came to mind as soon as I managed to squeeze through a pack of photographers to spend some time with HMD Global ’s banana pho — er, I mean feature phone. If you recall the popular Nokia 8110 that was released back in 1996 (the one Keanu Reeves used in The Matrix ), well you’re in for a blast from the past because it’s back with an updated design, 4G connectivity, and far more smarts than any other feature phone.. There are 1.3 billion people in the world that use feature phones — dumb phones that don’t do much else than make calls and send texts — and in less than a year, HMD Global has proclaimed itself the No. 1 manufacturer for these types of phones. That’s largely because it’s licensing the Nokia brand name, which clearly still holds a lot of value to quite a number of people. The Nokia 3310 was the first feature phone HMD revived last year , and now the spotlight falls on the Nokia 8110. But this “dumb” phone isn’t a gimmick, because there’s a lot more to it than meets the eye.. The black Nokia 8110 4G is subtle and attractive, but there’s no denying the hypnotic lure of the banana yellow color; it’s a bright yellow that’s not afraid to stand out. Compared to last year’s 3310, the 8110 is a lot bigger, especially when you slide out the cover to reveal the keypad. It’s still compact compared to any modern smartphone, and the curved back easily makes the Nokia 8110 one of the most ergonomic phones, as it fits in the palm of your hand perfectly.. It’s made of plastic, and so it feels a little like a toy. The buttons are all clicky enough, though you may need to exert a little extra pressure on the power button on the top right. Sliding the cover down is fun, and we’re sure it will be even more exciting to hang up calls by sliding it back up again.. This dumb phone isn’t a gimmick, because there’s a lot more than meets the eye.. It took a few minutes to get used to the buttons — the end call button is the back button, and you can tap the top left, center, and right keys to navigate different menus and the app drawer. The software was responsive, and we didn’t notice any kind of slowdown. It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 205 processor, which we honestly have never used before, but it feels capable enough for the low-power tasks commanded by the 8110.. The 2.4-inch screen isn’t too sharp, but it’s bright and handily did the job in our quick tests. Don’t expect much at all from the 2-megapixel camera on the back, but it’s there in case you need it. There’s also 4GB of internal storage to store some music and files.. The phone has a 1,500mAh battery, which HMD said offers a standby time of 25 days. That’s a big incentive for these feature phones as secondary devices to your smartphone — especially when traveling.. What’s unique about the Nokia 8110 4G is how, at launch, you’ll be able to download and use Google Maps, Google Search, and Google Assistant, as well as Facebook and Twitter. The phone doesn’t run Android, but HMD worked with these companies to bring these apps to the phone, and there’s even an app store where you’ll be able to download even more apps.. This is the most interesting feature about the phone, but sadly none of the demo units at the press conference had these services installed or available. A representative said they will be available when the phone launches. We can’t wait to see how Google Assistant, an artificially intelligent assistant, works on a feature phone. Snake was installed, and the experience is the same as it was on the Nokia 3310 .. You’ll also be able to sync your email, contacts, and calendar through Gmail and Outlook. Since it can use 4G networks, you can also turn the 8110 into a hot spot to provide data for other devices.. The Nokia 8110 4G will only cost 79 euros ($97 U.S.), and it will be available in April 2018. It’s unclear whether it will be available in the U.S., but we expect it to eventually arrive stateside sometime later this year.. We’ll have to wait and see how those smart features perform on this phone, but so far the Nokia 8110 4G may just be the ultimate backup phone to your smartphone.. Nokia 8110 4G Compared To.

Nokia 1, Nokia 6 (2018), Nokia 7 Plus, Nokia 8 Sirocco and Nokia 8110 4G announced at the MWC 2018. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Do they have what it takes to compete in the Indian smartphone market?. Nokia 8110 4G Nokia 1 Nokia 6 (2018) Nokia 7 Plus. The N okia 1 , Nokia 6 (2018) , Nokia 7 Plus , Nokia 8 Sirocco , and the Nokia 8110 4G were just showcased at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2018 .. Last year, Nokia Mobiles received a lukewarm response to its devices in India but it is gradually making its mark in the global frontier. The Nokia 8 lacked an impactful ‘x-factor’ while the Nokia 5 and Nokia 3 didn’t fare too well in comparison the Xiaomi Redmi 4 and Moto G5 .. Though Nokia Mobiles used to be one of the biggest brands in the mobile market (some say the Apple of the early 21st century), they’re yet to wow the world with their devices.. The only Nokia feature phone to be announced at the MWC 2018, the Nokia 8110 4G is priced at 79 Euros (approximately Rs. Termed as “another icon is reborn” after the launch of the Nokia 3310 last year, this phone should be available starting in May. And, in all honestly, the banana yellow variant looks a whole lot more appealing than the black option. As a feature phone, the JioPhone is much cheaper, but the Nokia phone does offer more apps that are tailored to an android rich experience.. Nokia 1 has been announced at $85 (approximately Rs.5500), which is expected to launch in April 2018. But, when it actually launches in India, it will probably be more competitively priced keeping the country’s smartphone market in mind.. Alongside the Reliance JioPhone and Karbonn A40 Indian, among others, trying to penetrate the entry level market, the Nokia 1 could offer substantial competition by offering Android Go.. Going head-to-head with Xiaomi's Redmi 5A , the Nokia 1 has an edge by offering Android Oreo (Go Edition ) over the Xiaomi phone’s Android Nougat interface. Although aside from longer battery life, Nokia 1 doesn’t outperform Redmi 5A in any other way. The Xiaomi phone has a faster CPU, more RAM, as well as more storage capacity. It even supports better camera resolution and HD video recording.. Android Go will really have to make an impact on providing a better user experience for the Nokia 1 to be able to take on its competition, especially since the Nokia phone only has 1GB of RAM. If Android Go works the way Google has promised that it will (note, they had the same expectation with Android One when they launched it), then the optimization of the interface will be of particular interest to users where high-speed mobile data penetration still remains low in India.. Nokia 6 (2018), thus far only available in China, was also announced at the MWC 2018. Priced at a global average of 279 Euros (Rs. 22,196), its launch is scheduled for April. It’s going to run Android Oreo out-of-the-box and be in competition with the Xiaomi Mi A1.. The Mi A1 has a dual camera feature in its favor, which the Nokia 6 does not feature as well as the fact that it runs on stock Android. Even the Redmi Note 5 has bigger screen with better resolution. Not to mention that the prices of both phones are cheaper than what is currently speculated for the Nokia 6 (2018) when it comes to India.. Sure, the Nokia 6 (2018) is an improvement over it’s predecessor with the Snapdragon 630 which is apparently 60 percent faster, but is that enough to for Nokia to make its mark in this price segment?. What is exciting about the Nokia 6, is its wireless charging with can charge the phone up to 50 percent in the span of minutes.. The Nokia 7 Plus was announced at 399 Euro (Rs.31,743) to be launched in April as well. It’s unique selling proposition is its camera with 3 highly sensitive image sensors.. What’s really interesting is the Pro Camera that lets you have full control over all the key settings. There’s even a new image suite equipped with AI tech.. Nokia Mobiles is sticking to its company’s signature offer of 2 day battery life which is rare in phones with these many specs. Equipped with Snapdragon 660 SoC and 4GB RAM, one has to ask the question of whether it’s really going to be enough?. Competing against Nokia in this segment will be the Xiaomi Mi 7 , that’s already cheaper. With more RAM (6GB vs 8GB) and a faster CPU (2.2 GHz vs 2.8GHz), the Xiaomi phone is a better option.. The Nokia 7 Plus does have the advantage of sporting a bigger screen as well as expandable memory.. The feature that may help it win over the Indian audience is integration of FM, which the Xiaomi phone does not support.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is the flagship phone of the Nokia range at the MWC this year. Priced at 749 Euros (Rs.59,589), 95 percect of the phones surface is vacuum molded Gorilla Glass 5.. The phone’s exterior is carved out of a single block of stainless steel, which has greater integrity than aluminium. It’s water and dust resistant adding to its durability. At 7.5mm thin at the center to less than 2mm around the edges, the phone also supports wireless charging.. It sports the same camera capabilities as the Nokia 7 Plus but it also equipped with 3 high dynamic range microphones.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco runs on the Snapdragon 835 SoC which are also seen in the OnePlus 5T , Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 and Motorola Moto Z2 Force. One critical difference is that while these variants still run on Android Nougat, the Nokia 8 will be running on Android O. The Nokia 8 will sport a battery that’s better than the Moto Z2 Force, but still not as big as the OnePlus 5T at 3300mAH and Mi Mix 2 at 3400mAH.. Storage capacities and RAM being at par, the main USP of the Nokia 8 is the it’s camera capabilities. While the others phones may also have dual camera capabilities, the Nokia 8 Sirocco is equipped with Carl-Zeiss optics that apparently make a world of difference.. All in all, the new Nokia 8 still needs to be priced more competitively to have an impact otherwise its competitors offer better specifications at a lower price point.. Nokia Mobiles was the first manufacturer to promise monthly security updates as well as to stay pure to Android. Let’s see how these launches play out for the company. It’s not going to be easy considering the competition they face from Motorola and Xiaomi in the Indian market, but they may have a chance considering the number of people who’re loyal to the brand and expect to see great things.. Perhaps once the phones are launched in India, they’ll competitively priced to overcome the lacking specifications that their counterparts offers for a cheaper price..

The Nokia 3310 took MWC 2017 by storm, even though it was a. Nokia told me it has sold a lot of those phones and this year at MWC 2018 it’s following it up with another reworked classic – the Nokia 8110.. You’ll be able to pick up the Nokia 8110 for around €79 when it ships in May. Nokia hasn’t confirmed UK or US pricing.. I have to admit that I don’t feel any nostalgia or fondness for the 8110. That’s probably to do with the fact it came out in 1996 and I hadn’t even started school then. When I asked the rest of the Trusted Reviews team they responded with equal ambivalence – with the single memory being that it featured in the original The Matrix film.. It might not be as iconic as the 3310, but it’s certainly got a quirky design – it looks like a banana, especially in the bright yellow colour I saw. The phone curves, with the keyboard hidden by a retro sliding cover. I haven’t seen anything like this in years and it made me smile.. Unlike the Nokia 3310 from last year, the 8110 feels a bit more feature-packed. It has Wi-Fi, basic app support and 4G. Saying that, this is still very much a ‘feature phone’ – so don’t expect it to come running Android or have any access to the Google Play store. Nokia reps told me you’ll be able download a Facebook app and hopefully more in the future.. The screen measures 2.4 inches, there’s 512MB of RAM, a camera on the back and it can be. used as a 4G hotspot for other devices. But, really, specs don’t matter here. This isn’t a device most of us would buy as a main phone; it’s much more likely to be a secondary phone at festivals.. The one spec that puts modern smartphones to shame is the battery life. Nokia said it should last 20 days on a single charge, or make a single eight-hour phone call. Can your iPhone X do that?. It might not be as iconic as the 3310, but the 8110 certainly leaves less of a sour cash-grab taste in my mouth. This has a few features that could genuinely make it a decent secondary phone, plus the design will bring a smile to your face.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

Slide to hang up your calls on HMD’s nostalgic Nokia 8110 4G. HMD Global, the company behind Nokia-branded phones, brought us a wave of nostalgia last year when it announced new version of the Nokia 3310 that could connect to 3G networks.. Get ready for another blast to the past, because its next feature phone is the Nokia 8110, which as its name suggests includes support for 4G networks.. The Nokia 8110 was originally released back in 1996, and it was among the first of its kind to introduce the ‘slider’ — a cover you can open by pressing a button to access the keypad or to answer a call. With the 4G 2018 model, you’ll be able to slide open the phone to answer calls, and close it to hang up. It’s not as satisfying as hanging up a call on a flip phone, but we’re getting closer than ever.. In comparison to the original model, the new Nokia 8110 4G has a more curved design, with a 2.4-inch rounded display and an improved keypad. On the back is a 2-megapixel rear-facing camera.. Inside, it’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 205 chipset, a 1,500mAh that offers standby time of 25 days, and 4GB of internal storage.. While the Nokia 8110 was considered a high-end device back in the ’90s, its new model is more of a companion device for those days you want to disconnect — but not completely. You’ll be surprised to learn that HMD worked closely with Google to integrate apps like Google Maps, Google Assistant, and Facebook. You’ll also be able to import your contacts and sync your calendar from Gmail and Outlook.. There will be an app store included on the Nokia 8110, but it isn’t tied to the Google Play Store or App Store for iOS. This is where you’ll download the specific apps you’d like to add to the phone, but we aren’t exactly sure what type of apps to expect yet. The device will come with pre-loaded games along with downloadable ones as well — including the redesigned Snake game.. With a long-lasting battery life, access to 4G networks, as well as Google Maps, the Nokia 8110 4G could be great for camping or traveling. You’ll have the option of choosing between Traditional Black or Banana Yellow — which actually resembles the fruit, in case you’ve ever wanted a working Banana phone..

Today, at MWC in Barcelona, Nokia officially took the wraps off the new 8110, a rehash of the device that was made immortal by the Matrix film franchise. The new version of the legendary slider phone will come with 4G connectivity and a selected group of apps such as Google’s Assistant, Maps, Search, Facebook, Twitter and for old times’ sake Snake. It also comes with a battery life befitting of feature phones: 17 days, with nine days of talk time. The 8110 comes in banana yellow and black. The phone will be curved like a banana for..reasons.. Nokia was known back in the day for their impeccable feature phones, and HMD Global is looking to cash in on that nostalgia. The 8110 joins the ranks of the 3310, another big hit for the company. The new version of the 3310 sold like hot cakes. The company managed to sell a whopping 70 million devices worldwide in 2017 (both feature and smartphones combined). For all practical purposes, feature phones are dead and serve no purpose, but it looks like HMD found a way to make them work.. Related Rumor : NVIDIA GTX 2080, 2070 Ampere Cards Launching March 26-29 At GTC 2018. Juho Sarvikas, CPO of HMD Global, described the 8110 as a vacation phone. It’s for occasions when you need to get off the grid but not completely. The phone has found mild success in Silicon Valley, where people who make a livelihood out of getting people addicted to tech, are concerned about the effects of too much tech in life.. Without further ado, here are the full specs of the phone:. Would you buy the new Nokia 8110 as your backup phone? Let us know in the comments below..

Home Nokia Nokia 8110 4G – The reborn of the Matrix phone. Nokia 8110 4G – The reborn of the Matrix phone. By Khurram Ali. Within a half an hour, HMD Global unveiled five phones this year under the Nokia brand. The first one was the reborn of the phone from the 90’s Matrix movie – Nokia 8110.. Last year Nokia 3310 was refreshed with cool design and colors an 3G connectivity. But this year, HMD brings you the Nokia 8110 with 4G connectivity. Along with that it brings the Google Maps and Google Assistant.. Where the speculations were hinting about the Nokia 3310 to carry 4G connection this year, this is surprising that HMD Global held something similar but different this year.. Nokia 8110 4G keeps the curvy design with slider but sure doesn’t have the antenna which is great. The new Nokia 8110 however features tactile mechanics, with slide to answer and end calls, “as well as an addictive helicopter style spin on its axis.”. Inside the Nokia 8110 is featuring the Qualcomm’s 201 Mobile Platform and with 4G connectivity, it will support VoLTE and Wi-Fi hotspot. In addition to Google Maps and Google Assistant, there will be Google Search, Facebook, Twitter, Outlook and Gmail. Not to mention the revamped version of Snake.. More apps will come to the phone in future but you can expect anything within the limit of the processor – Snapdragon 205. The screen 2.4” curved display with QVGA resolution.. The 1,500mAh battery will give you 9 hours of VoLTE calls or 48 hours for music through headphones. There are single and dual-SIM versions of the phone but in markets like Pakistan, you will see the dual-SIM model.. Nokia 8110 4G will be available from April and will cost €79 (approximately PKR 10,000). Do not expect this price to hit in Pakistan market as European prices are almost 30% higher than the rest of the world. The phone will be available in Traditional Black and Banana Yellow..

This time last year Nokia stole the show at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona with an unlikely star, its updated version of the classic 3310. This year another retro-inspired handset for feature phone fans has been added to the Nokia lineup in the form of the 8110 4G. The original 8110 became iconic thanks in part to the 1999 movie. (while simultaneously inescapably dating the film). Of course you can unsubscribe and no we don't share your info.. Copyright © 2018 Stuff, All Rights Reserved.

Cellular: Mobile Phones, Call Contracts, Content, MMS and SMS. It is free, and it takes less than 1 minute to register.. It is free, and it comes with many benefits.. Results 1 to 4 of 4. Join Date Mar 2016. Back in 1999, Keanu Reeves was famous for playing Neo in The Matrix, and not for looking sad on a bench. Nokia was also the “world’s leading mobile phone supplier” back then, and it used this popularity to feature its Nokia 8110 “banana phone” in The Matrix film. At the time everyone who considered themselves cool (definitely me) wanted a Nokia phone just like Neo’s, but most of us had to settle for the Nokia 7110 with its spring-loaded slider. Now HMD, makers of Nokia-branded phones, is bringing the Nokia 8110 back to life as a retro classic. Just like the Nokia 3310 that was a surprise hit at Mobile World Congress last year, the 8110 plays on the same level of nostalgia. The slightly curved handset has a slider that lets you answer and end calls, and HMD is creating traditional black and banana yellow versions. The Nokia 8110 runs on the Smart Feature OS, so this is a basic featurephone and you’re not going to get access to the Android apps found on other Nokia Android smartphones. However, HMD is creating an app store for the device, which will include Facebook so there’s a chance other third parties might create their own apps for this. Unlike the 3310, the 8110 will ship with LTE support across Europe, with dual-SIM versions available too. Inside there’s a Qualcomm 205 Mobile Platform processor, 512MB of RAM, and 4GB of storage. While the banana phone looks big in pictures, it’s relatively small with just a 2.4-inch QVGA display and a 2-megapixel camera at the rear. You’ll even get access to a revamped Snake game, and an impressive 25 days of battery standby. The Nokia 8110 will be available in May for just 79 euros (R1123,64). Join Date Mar 2016.

Home News Blast from the Past: HMD Revives the ‘Matrix Phone’ with the New.... By Nikhil Subramaniam -. Besides unveiling a whole host of modern Android devices, HMD Global saved some excitement for the tech nostalgia brigade as well. The company announced a new version of the iconic Nokia 8110 4G, completed with 4G connectivity and specialized apps, at MWC 2018.. You may remember the Nokia 8110 as the phone seen in The Matrix, and used by Keanu Reeves’ Neo. The distinctive curved shape, the snap of its cover and the classic look made it an instant hit in the market.. Last year, HMD remade the classic Nokia 3310, so naturally this time it had to bring out a new version of one of its other iconic phones.. The Nokia 8110 will come in either black or yellow, which is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the banana phone moniker the original had picked up. The 8110 will run an operating system known as Kai OS, with Google and Facebook working on apps for the feature phone. The price of the 4G device is expected to be around $100, which is a steep price to pay for nostalgia.. “Nokia had these very iconic design legends and different people remember the 8110 for different reasons — but, certainly it’s a lot about that emotional factor. But, actually it is also in Western markets, it’s more as a lifestyle secondary phone and bringing it with 4G and Wi-Fi and some key apps people use everyday, it can now be a true secondary device. But in some of the emerging markets, it is still a primary device,”. Florian Seiche, CEO of HMD Global, told CNBC .. The 8110 4G has support for VoLTE calls and for Wi-Fi hotspots, plus it features an ample 1,500mAh battery that is rated to last over 9 hours for VoLTE calls, and for 48 hours of music playback..
