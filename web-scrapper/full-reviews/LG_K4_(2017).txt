The LG K4 2017 comes with a 5-inch display (854 x 480 pixels), 1.1 GHz quad-core processor, 1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of storage and two 5-megapixel cameras.. OS: Android (6.0), LG UX UI. Dimensions: 5.70 x 2.86 x 0.31 inches (144.7 x 72.6 x 7.9 mm). Weight: 4.87 oz (138 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 480 x 854 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 3), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Smile detection, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Effects. Features: Continuous autofocus, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Quad-core, 1100 MHz, ARM Cortex-A7, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 4.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 4.2 days (100 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8.

Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Rated 1 out of. less than10 months old and goes to voicemail on all incoming calls tried everything to fix it bought a LG Q6 and with in a month wont even power up wont buy lg products again. Rated 3 out of. Average Phone With No Storage Space. I've had this phone for about 2 months. It's very very nice looking, sleek design, and an absolute eye catcher! However, once you decide you want apps and such, It's a different story. Like allot of the other reviews have said It's a complete piece of junk when it comes to space.. Almost no internal storage space is available, and It's a waste to spend money on an SD card as you can't force anything to download onto it. Every time you want a new app OR even an update for the "built in software" you have to UN-INSTALL something just to be able to get enough space freed up LOL. For that reason alone I don't recommend someone buying this phone unless your only going to be texting/calling, but then why would you even need an android?. For a 2017 model with such limited memory options It's kind of sad as there are many other OLDER phones out there with better built in options for space. Oh also the speaker is very cheaply made. Voice calls, music, playing games, etc. Rated 1 out of. Don't even bother wasting your time. If you're looking for an overrated budget phone whose claim to fame is the ability to have sd card support* this one is for you!. *Except not really, because you can't really use it for storage of anything useful, like apps.. And before we begin, if you use a media app like VLC? Good luck. Get used to creating playlists to files that can be found yourself, as the system refuses the app the ability to add anything from the sd card.. Really, if you're not over the age of seventy, and use a phone for more than texting or calling, avoid this piece of junk at all costs. This would be a great phone, in 2012 maybe. But I guarantee no one of relevance in LG will read this.. After dealing with no real sd card support, and getting messages where I have no storage, when I have 32 gb? You want me to recommend the phone?. Appalled by your design of a horrid device, I'll do it honestly.. If I can go buy a 6 year old phone and it works better, you've got some things to work on LG. At least its less of a failure than the last version of the k4, that's nice.. You can go to mobile store and pay like 100-120 for a old LG Google Nexus 4, and not this overpromoted device. Most old phones you could get around these issues, but not this one! Want to unlock the bootloader? You'll get the option!.. But there is no bootloader you can access, so its pointless.. Seems to be a trend with this phone. Leave it on a store shelf for the next unfortunate person. Go buy an old Nexus 4.. Rated 2 out of. Decent phone for the price, except memory. Phone is decent for the price, the system memory is HORRIBLE tho. You cannot sync your SD card to the internal memory, therefore you will NOT be able to download really any apps. Yea sure, you can move some apps to the SD card but you cannot set the apps to directly download to SD even when internal memory is full which results in you having to remove apps to download more. LG you really need to fix this, as the internal memory is basically full when you get it! let us use our SD Cards!!!!. Rated 2 out of. You get what you pay for. I bought this phone two weeks ago and am thoroughly disappointed. It ran great for the first three days, then it started to hang. Only a little at first, but gradually increased. I have a PIN to prevent pocket calls, and it hesitates between entering the numbers. I think next time I'll spend the extra for a better quality product :(. Rated 3 out of. It doesn't seem to be possible to install programs on the sd card. That limits app usage to the 8 gigs it comes with. That is barely enough to call it an android device.. Rated 5 out of. Bought this phone a month ago and it works great also told brother about it and he bought one to.. Rated 1 out of. Bought this phone four months ago. Now I can't talk on it without using the exterior speaker. tried to backup and reset the phone, hoping that it would return back to normal. Download LG product manuals and documentation.

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Inge Schwabe ( translated by Katherine Bodner), 08/03/2017. This phone is really an ideal first smartphone: if you are not accustomed to smartphones, you will have no difficulties navigating through the home screens, switching between two SIM cards or taking notes on the smartphone.

The LG K4 moves into the second round. The biggest improvement of the 2017 model compared to last year's LG K4 is the LC display, which replaces the old TN panel. Apart from that, not much has changed on the technical side. We have compared the K4 to the Huawei Y5 II, the Sony Xperia E5 and of course the Lenovo K6 , which only costs a little more than our device and convinced us with its extensive hardware features during testing..

Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. Optically, the new K4 is a big improvement from the old-fashioned design of its predecessor. Our test unit is black, but there is also a titanium-colored version. The narrow, shiny plastic frame is a nice contrast to the matte black back, which has a nice feel to it thanks to its textured surface. The frame widens a little at the bottom, where the audio and Micro-USB ports are located. This makes the case look even more dynamic.. If you are changing to LG from another smartphone manufacturer, you will look for the on/off button on the side of the device in vain. You will only find the volume rocker; LG has placed the power button on the back of the smartphone. This is where many other LG smartphones have a fingerprint sensor which is used to unlock the device. The K4 is not equipped with a fingerprint sensor, however, but still has the round button at the back. Due to its small size, our finger did not naturally lie on the on/off button and had to be bent to press it. This is not a huge drawback, but can be a little uncomfortable. The display can also be activated by tapping it twice thanks to the LG Knock Code - and then unlocked the usual way.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

The LG K4's low storage capacity - users have only 3.6 of the 8 GB available for personal data - is a real drawback: the system started reporting storage problems after installing only a few additional apps and the test unit did not even offer enough storage for us to have all benchmarks apps installed at the same time. On top of that, we received an error message when trying to update pre-existing apps after having installed a few ourselves. So you will probably not manage without an external memory card. The microSD slot is positioned beneath the cover for the exchangeable battery, which should not matter if you use the card as storage expansion. The Micro-USB port does not support USB OTG, so if you want to use a physical device for data transfers, you cannot use a USB stick and will have to use the memory card instead. But at least you do not have to remove the battery to remove the memory card.. The K4 supports Wi-Fi Direct and can be used as a radio with a headset (not included) thanks to the integrated tuner. The device does not have an LED that lets you know whether there are any missed calls or new messages.. The device's operating system is Android 6, which is rather old already; the Android security patches are from the beginning of 2017. It offers three different interfaces, although one of them has to be downloaded if needed. This way, users can decide if they want an app drawer or prefer to have all apps on the home screen. The third option is a simple interface with connections to the contacts and telephone on the main home screen, while other apps and an app drawer can be placed on further home screens. Users can also customize the Android navigation keys.. You will find the Office apps from Polaris and a radio app for the integrated FM tuner among the K4's pre-installed apps. The possibility to take notes via tapping the "louder" side of the volume rocker twice (even from a locked screen) is quite handy.. normal home screen with access to the app drawer. simple interface with a button to add further apps and two widgets. Our test unit does not have NFC, which would speed up making a Bluetooth connection with similarly equipped devices. The Wi-Fi is limited to the 2.4 GHz frequency, which is normal for entry-level devices. The download rate of 54.9 MBit/s is similar to that of our comparison devices. The device supports all frequencies that are relevant in Europe, but lacks bands 12 and 17, which would be important for the US. 4 supports download rates of up to 150 MBit/s and upload rates of up to 50 MBit/s. Even though current smartphones offer higher rates, these results are quite alright for the cheap K4..

GPS reception in an apartment block. LG has improved our test unit's GPS module since its predecessor, which can now also receive signals indoors. This is helpful if you want to map a route from home.. The small K4 had a real surprise in store for us when we took it on our usual bike ride with the Garmin Edge 500 (a professional navigation system for bicyclists). The K4 stuck very close to our route and was only a few meters off the measured distance. If the small 5-inch display does not bother you, you can definitely use the K4 as a navigator.. The two SIM cards have their own slots and neither needs to share its space with an optional memory card (this has its own slot in the K4) - which is a configuration that is rather unusual nowadays. Apart from the usual options for deciding which SIM should be used by default for telephoning and data connections, the device also has a dedicated button on the home screen which switches between the two SIM cards. The telephone interface also offers a direct connection and switches to the SMS app with the click of a button.. The voice quality is good in both directions during telephoning and both call partners had no difficulty understanding one another.. quick switch between the two SIM cards. Both the main and the front camera, which you can switch to by swiping the screen within the camera app, have a maximum of 5 MP and shoot pictures with 3.6 MP in the preset 16:9 format.. The cameras both have good exposure control as you can see from the two pictures below: on the left is a picture we took with the main camera's HDR mode, on the right a selfie at dusk. Both images lack sharpness in the distance, which is a disadvantage, particularly for the main camera.. The device offers HDR, auto focus and an LED flash, but the app does not have any filters or other options - the LG K4 cannot even take a panorama picture.. Unlike the main camera, the selfie camera performs quite well compared to its competition. It does not offer any filters either, but has various possibilities for shutter release: voice commands such as "cheese" "smile" or "LG", gesture commands or the so-called Auto Shot, which uses face recognition technology to automatically take a picture once the image is still. Another feature of the front camera is that the display can reduce the preview image and turn up the brightness around the image to help in bad lighting conditions.. main camera, standard settings (16:9, 3.6 megapixels) full resolution. ftron camera, standard settings (16:9, 3.6 megapixels) full resolution. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. Color deviation values are quite good as you can see from the photo of the color card. The low-resolution camera cannot produce images with high-resolution details (mono chart).. The device comes with an 850-mAh power supply and connecting USB cable. LG differentiates between its warranty for the smartphone itself (24 months), parts subject to wear such as the battery, power supply and cable (6 months) and accessories (12 months).. The capacitive touchscreen can register gestures with up to five fingers. The height of the keyboard can be adjusted and is comfortable to use in portrait mode: Alternative characters are displayed directly on the key and there is another line of numbers above the alphanumeric characters. In the preset for landscape mode, the K4 never uses the full available width, which means that you lose the advantage landscape mode usually brings. This can be changed in the keyboard settings. LG has added another feature which was not available for the old K4: gesture typing.. maximum keyboard height in portrait mode. ex works, the keyboard does not use the full available width in landscape mode. The K4's LC display still has only 854x480 pixels, which is low, even for a small 5-inch display with a pixel density of only 196 PPI. Brightness distribution is very even at 92% and the average brightness is 372 cd/mÂ². The low black value also means good contrast values of 1:1100.. LG has equipped the model from 2017 with an ambient light sensor that automatically regulates the screen brightness.. 379 cd/m² 382 cd/m² 354 cd/m² 380 cd/m² 385 cd/m² 357 cd/m² 382 cd/m² 369 cd/m² 356 cd/m². 92 % Center on Battery: 385. cd/m²) ΔE Color 6.2 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 7 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.08.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 8995 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. The new LC display does better than its predecessor's TN panel in our tests. Although the new display has a blue cast and images appear rather cool, the color temperature of 8257 K is closer to the ideal 6000 K than its predecessor was with 9372 K. Color space deviation has dropped from 11.4 to 6.2 (sRGB) and 11 to 7 (gray scales), which is a significant difference..

In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.9 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is similar to the average of all tested devices (42.2 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Thanks to the ambient light sensor, brightness increases automatically. to 372 cd/mÂ² outdoors, which makes it possible to read the K4's screen despite some reflections. Viewing-angle stability has been improved by the LC display and it now has only. very slight color deviation when looking at the screen from the side.. On last year's model, you could hardly recognize any color when looking from the side; this year the new LC display just gives the colors a light yellow tinge..

The Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 ( MSM8909 ) is mainly used in entry-level smartphones, including our LG K4. It cannot offer very high performance, particularly combined with only 1 GB of RAM. The combination goes about its work slowly and if you are used to faster smartphones, you might need a little patience when opening apps or switching between open apps.. The K4 remains at the bottom of the list in most of the following benchmarks and some of the graphics tests of the 3DMark and GFXBench programs could not even be carried out.

Low processor performance, limited RAM and not a lot of pixels - the K4 with an. does not look like a very promising gamer from the start. You will need patience for the loading times alone. Once the game is running, apps like â Super Mario â can run quite smoothly. â Riptide GP â jerked occasionally, but there were no real problems. The motion sensor reacts too slowly when you are driving out of a bend, so the K4 is not suitable for Racing games.. We measured an increase in temperature around the top of the smartphone in our measurements and this development also becomes noticeable rather quickly in everyday use. Even after a short telephone call the K4 heats up enough to make it feel uncomfortable on the ear.. 42.1 °C 32.5 °C 33.2 °C. 42.1 °C 35.8 °C 35.6 °C. 38.4 °C 39.3 °C 34.7 °C.

The quality of the integrated mono speaker is OK for a smartphone just over $100. Sure, volume and sound are rather flat, but music sounds good and is not tinny or distorted. You will need a headset to enjoy your favorite music, but it should be enough for a little breakfast radio or listening to music from the local radio station in the evenings.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 31.6 30 25 25.4 27.2 31 25.3 26 40 32.9 27.1 50 33.6 29.4 63 31.6 35.3 80 28.4 30.9 100 27 29.7 125 20.8 27.2 160 22 24.8 200 21.3 29.6 250 20.8 38.2 315 21.2 42.7 400 19.4 50.6 500 19.5 58.9 630 17.7 64.1 800 17.9 70.3 1000 17.8 76.8 1250 17.3 75.8 1600 17.4 74.7 2000 16.7 72.1 2500 17.2 71.7 3150 18.2 71.3 4000 17.9 73.8 5000 17.6 74.1 6300 17.7 77.9 8000 17.8 81.4 10000 17.9 73.5 12500 18.1 66.1 16000 18.2 61.2 SPL 30 86.5 N 1.3 66.4 median 17.9 LG K4 2017 median 70.3 Delta 1.3 14.1 32.4 33.9 31.3 30.2 31.7 31.8 26 32.9 39.4 40.2 36.2 35.3 28.6 29.8 25.4 28.3 21.3 32 23.3 27.8 22.5 30.4 22.4 37.2 21.3 42.3 18.4 46.2 17.5 55.4 17.5 57.3 17.2 62.4 16.8 67.5 17.3 68.3 17.4 67.4 16.6 76.6 17.3 75.6 17.6 75.2 17.6 79.5 17.7 79.8 17.4 77.4 17.7 72.9 17.9 67.9 18.1 58.1 18.1 40.4 29.8 87 1.3 59.8 median 17.7 Huawei Y5 II median 62.4 1.6 17.2 32.4 36.9 31.3 34 31.7 33.8 26 32.8 39.4 34.7 36.2 31.2 28.6 27.9 25.4 24.4 21.3 24.8 23.3 25.9 22.5 30.5 22.4 37.1 21.3 40.2 18.4 44.8 17.5 51.9 17.5 55.6 17.2 61.1 16.8 67.5 17.3 68.8 17.4 65 16.6 73.6 17.3 75.5 17.6 76.1 17.6 79.2 17.7 79.5 17.4 75.7 17.7 71 17.9 67.3 18.1 61.5 18.1 42.9 29.8 86.4 1.3 56.8 median 17.7 Huawei Y6 II Compact median 61.5 1.6 16.6 31.6 41.4 25.4 35.5 25.3 32.1 32.9 34.7 33.6 29.8 31.6 30.6 28.4 31 27 24.5 20.8 27 22 25.9 21.3 30.5 20.8 39.3 21.2 49.1 19.4 54.7 19.5 58.9 17.7 62.1 17.9 69 17.8 73.2 17.3 74.3 17.4 71.9 16.7 70.3 17.2 66.4 18.2 63.8 17.9 63.7 17.6 60.6 17.7 61.9 17.8 67.6 17.9 68.1 18.1 56.8 18.2 49.5 30 80.7 1.3 45 median 17.9 Gigaset GS160 median 61.9 1.3 11.6 31.6 35.7 25.4 33.3 25.3 32.1 32.9 26.4 33.6 26.2 31.6 33.3 28.4 30.5 27 34.3 20.8 32.6 22 31.5 21.3 36.6 20.8 41.7 21.2 44.6 19.4 49.7 19.5 54.8 17.7 61.4 17.9 66.1 17.8 65.9 17.3 66.9 17.4 63.6 16.7 58.6 17.2 63.3 18.2 65.9 17.9 69.1 17.6 69.2 17.7 64.7 17.8 58.5 17.9 52.9 18.1 40.2 18.2 29.5 30 76.5 1.3 37.3 median 17.9 Sony Xperia E5 median 58.5 1.3 12.8 28.2 27.4 28.2 25.6 27.9 25.6 24.1 25.2 24.1 25.7 28.7 25.7 24.7 26.4 24.7 23.6 22.9 23.6 24.6 23.6 24.6 25.2 24.3 25.2 34.3 25.1 34.3 40.3 19.7 40.3 47.8 18.6 47.8 50.5 19.7 50.5 52 19.9 52 49.9 18.9 49.9 49.8 18.9 49.8 54.8 19.8 54.8 63.2 20.8 63.2 71.3 17.2 71.3 72.6 17.1 72.6 74.4 14.4 74.4 73.4 13.9 73.4 71.9 13.2 71.9 70.2 12.9 70.2 67.5 13 67.5 68.4 12.8 68.4 73.8 12.7 73.8 75.7 12.7 75.7 72.5 12.8 72.5 69.1 12.8 69.1 59.9 13.1 59.9 83.6 28 83.6 53.6 1 53.6 median 67.5 Lenovo K6 median 17.1 median 67.5 11.3 3.8 11.3 42.5 39.6 32.4 42.5 41.2 35.5 31.3 41.2 36.8 34.8 31.7 36.8 46.9 27 26 46.9 47.9 27.3 39.4 47.9 34.5 26.5 36.2 34.5 29 24.5 28.6 29 27.9 28.6 25.4 27.9 25.2 22.7 21.3 25.2 25.3 21.3 23.3 25.3 26.4 22.8 22.5 26.4 26.8 19.9 22.4 26.8 34 20 21.3 34 44.1 21.5 18.4 44.1 58.6 32.8 17.5 58.6 68.2 41.8 17.5 68.2 74.8 50.6 17.2 74.8 75.1 51.3 16.8 75.1 73.1 49.3 17.3 73.1 73.2 48.4 17.4 73.2 74 48.7 16.6 74 77.6 51.4 17.3 77.6 76.5 50.9 17.6 76.5 77.5 51.4 17.6 77.5 78.5 53 17.7 78.5 75.4 49.7 17.4 75.4 77.2 52.4 17.7 77.2 68.5 43 17.9 68.5 64.5 38.7 18.1 64.5 54.9 29.8 18.1 54.9 87.4 62 29.8 87.4 68 14.5 1.3 68 median 68.5 HTC Desire 530 median 43 median 17.7 median 68.5 16.4 11.9 1.6 16.4 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Frequency diagram in comparison (checkboxes can be turned on/off!). LG has managed to keep the K4's power consumption low and the device does better than all comparison devices in this respect. The provided power supply is below the usual standard of 1000 mAh and offers only 850 mAh, which is rather unusual. With this power supply, the K4 needs about three hours for the 2500-mAh battery to fully recharge..

In our standardized Wi-Fi test the K4 manages a runtime of over ten hours, which is a good value compared to its seven competitors in this review. It can easily beat two of the other devices and the Lenovo K6's twelve hours of battery runtime is probably simply due to its larger battery, so its power consumption rates are not necessarily better than those of the K4..

Compared to its predecessor, the LG K4 has come into bloom: It has a modern look and a better LC display than the last model had, although its low resolution still is not up to par. Its weak performance - both in the benchmarks and in practice, which becomes apparent through its slow response to inputs, means that we would not recommend the LG K4 to advanced users. If you are looking for a simple, easy-to-use phone, the LG K4 might be worth considering. The options for the home screen and especially the simple switching between the two SIM cards (if needed) are a plus, but there is no getting around the low internal storage. Nobody should have to rely on an external memory card.. LG K4 2017 - 2017-07-31 07/31/2017 v6 Inge Schwabe. Read all 2 comments / answer.

Overall a good phone and I think value for money.. Rated 1 out of. Worst Phone I have ever had.

Could you share the stock wallpapers of this phone please?:). Recommending a Xiaomi device? You're taking your chances - grey market devices shipped from China will not be Google certified, which means one of two things: either you won't have Google Play services, or else the Google Play services will have been side-loaded via some unofficial hacks. In the former case, your Android experience will be compromised. In the latter case, the entire concept of a web of trust maintaining the privacy of your data will be compromised. Xiaomi also manufactures devices that were deliberately intended for the international market, and those devices will be Google certified, with Google Play services factory-loaded. If you get such a device, then you'll have better chances of using the full Android experience without any middlemen spying on you. But since the only way to obtain Xiaomi devices in my country is online, and often there is no effective way to evaluate ahead of time the trustworthiness some of these online stores. So you may not know for sure if you have the Chinese or International editions of any of these phones, and therefore you won't know for sure if you're getting a genuinely useful device, or a device so insecure it's no better than a paperweight.. I have this phone and honestly it's great. I got it for 120 dollars and before it I had a Samsung Galaxy S4 and honestly I still feel like I'm using the S4. Yeah the 8 GB of storage sucks but put an SD card in and move some stuff around and it's no problem. Also the camera is better than you think. Everyone that keeps saying it's such a bad phone probably has a really good one so they see this has bad specs and immediately assume it's bad. If someone were on a budget I would recommend this to them if they were looking for a name brand and not one of those chinese ripoff phones that cost 80 dollars on Amazon. The phone has Android Marshmallow which is made for phones with lower specs so the quad core processor and 1 GB of RAM run really well with this phone. So far I'd give it an 8/10 for value so good job LG.. The man with no name, 25 Mar 2017 100$? I wouldn't pay $25 for it, it's about 8 years too late. Literally the worst phone ever conceived. The man with no name, 25 Mar 2017 100$? I wouldn't pay $25 for it, it's about 8 years too late. YESSSSSS AMEN TO YOU!!!!! I couldn't have dreamt of saying it better myself!!. Pe A Loe, 04 Apr 2017 Yes they kidding u!!! This budget phone people....what u want from $120 phone??? Think!!! LOL Phones like this shouldn't even exist in 2017. A Samsung S4 is much better and cheaper even than this one. Avoid this phone and this person I replied to's comments AT ALL COSTS. BOTH ARE MISLEADING AND WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON YOUR LIFE!!! You have been warned.. I got mine for "free" and I'm very happy with it. I owned an iPhone 3G back in 2007 and I very happy with it too. Now, 10 years later, I would only get an iPhone if it came in a gift box. Nice job LG, no complains from a long time LG user. The main Camera is of 8Mp.

LG is well known for its G series premium smartphones and they hardly release basic low budget smartphone. LG K4 (2017) has been made for the low budget consumers. 5 + 5 MP camera (Back camera with autofocus), FWVGA display, 1 GB RAM, 8 GB ROM, snapdragon 210 chipset, 1.1 GHz quad core CPU these are all specs of an average kind of smartphone. The only exceptional feature in this device is a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 display protection. So, considering all these features especially, 5 MP back camera, 1 GB RAM and 8 GB ROM the price is actually pretty high if you compare with some other devices in the market. In this price you may find better quality camera, 2 GB RAM and 16 GB ROM with better display quality, faster processor and performance. LG K4 (2017) also has 4G network which is a big plus. The brand has a well reputation for its build quality. But still according to our current market research the price is still a bit high for its specs.. User Rating: 2.64 ( 16 votes).
