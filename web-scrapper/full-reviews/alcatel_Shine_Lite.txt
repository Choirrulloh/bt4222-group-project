Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Quad-core, 1300 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 800, 850, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 7, 8, 20, 28.

Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Esto también se puede leer en español.. Show off your best selfie with the Alcatel Shine Lite. A fingerprint sensor, apps for selfies and a slim design are the highlights of Alcatel's new Shine Lite.. by September 1, 2016 12:30 AM PDT. Alcatel's slick, glassy Shine Lite phone. Alcatel Shine Lite is a metal mobile with a low price. Specs and key features 13-megapixel main camera with dual-tone flash 5-megapixel front camera with flash 5-inch HD (720p) display Fingerprint sensor Comes in black, gold and white Metal frame with glass front and back sides. Face it, selfies are pretty much the main reason many of us use our phone cameras these days. But a good selfie requires a few things: a front camera that can capture your mug with enough resolution, a flash for those times when the lighting isn't great and maybe a few apps for editing your work.. Alcatel's new Shine Lite, which the company introduced this week at IFA here in Berlin, has all of those things plus one more feature that's all the rage these days, a fingerprint sensor. It all comes in a neat design with a metal trim and back and front sides covered in glass.. The main camera is 13 megapixels. Next to it is a flash and below is the round sensor for touching your finger and unlocking the phone. The 5-megapixel front shooter also has a flash and sits just above the 5-inch display. After you've taken all those selfies, they're stored in a dedicated Selfie Album and you can create videos with your vanity shots with an app called Face Show. Another app, called Split Catcher, promises you to capture a scene with both cameras and create a collage. I wasn't able to try it during our demo.. Alcatel's slick, glassy Shine Lite phone. Like most other Alcatel phones, there's nothing about the Shine Lite that's particularly remarkable save for price. An unlocked model should be below 199 euros, converting to about $225, £170 or AU$295. Still, that puts it on par with the Motorola Moto G4 Plus ($249 or £199, which converts to about AU$330), which also has a fingerprint sensor. As we've long considered the Moto G family to be a prime example of how to build a budget phone, Alcatel will have to work hard to compete. We'll know for sure how the Shine Lite fares if we secure one for a full review. The Shine Lite will be released in Europe, the Americas and Asia this month..

High-end character without the price tag. If you fit into the twenty-somethings age bracket, then Alcatel is targeting you with the Alcatel Shine Lite smartphone. Alcatel has done a good job of selecting a number of key premium-phone elements for the Shine Lite, while keeping the pricing very affordable for the price conscious. The UK pricing for the Alcatel Shine Lite begins as £12.50 per month on a 24 month term and you are sure to be surprised at what you get for this money. So let’s get on with our phone review .. The Alcatel Shine Lite is made from a combination of glass and metal. The front and back faces are made from curved 2.5D Dragontrail glass. This curves gently at the edges, which is particularly finger friendly when swiping in or out, from or to, the edge of the screen.. New: Alcatel A3 review. Dragontrail glass is a chemically hardened form of glass that is both crack and scratch resistant. Its use on the back gives a durable surface that won’t wear over time, while reflecting light in a charismatic way.. The symmetrical form includes a metal frame that has been polished and brushed in different areas to give the contrast of matte against shine. The choice of colours includes the Alcatel Shine Lite Prime Black and Shine Lite Satin Gold.. The 5” IPS display has a high definition resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels. The IPS screen technology makes the display readable from wider than normal viewing angles. The display has also be optimised for use under direct sunlight.. The design of the Alcatel Shine Lite sees a body that measures 7.45mm thick and weighs in at 156g.. It is unusual to find fingerprint security on a phone in this pricing bracket, but the Alcatel Shine Lite has a fingerprint sensor and it puts it to good use. From the lock screen, you can use different fingerprints (up to five) to go straight to your favourite apps, such as Facebook, Instagram or the web browser.. In practice, it is rather difficult to use much more than the index finger of the hand you are holding the phone with. It does however, work very will if you flip the phone over and use fingerprints from the other hand.. The fingerprint sensor can also be used to secure the Safebox feature, where private documents, videos and images can be stored.. Alcatel Idol 4 with VR headset review. The Alcatel Shine Lite runs on Google’s Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system, which means you get a series of useful Google apps pre-loaded. These includes the Play Store, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, YouTube, Drive, Play Music, Play Movies & TV, Hangouts, Photos and Keep.. This Alcatel smartphone also comes with the Boost app, which can increase performance by analysing the phone. Boost might recommend stopping background apps running, cleaning junk files and enabling power saving.. These apps do take up a portion of the Alcatel Shine Lite’s internal 16GB memory, but thankfully there is a microSD card slot, for expanding the memory. The hardware for this phone includes a 1.3GHz quad-core processor with 2GB RAM, 4G internet connectivity, Bluetooth, GPS and dual microphones for noise cancellation.. The Alcatel Shine Lite has a high resolution 13MP camera. This camera is paired with a dual-tone flash for correctly lighting scenes and capturing balanced results. The main camera can also capture video at 720p (high definition) quality.. The secondary camera has a 5MP resolution and, once again unusually for a phone at this price, is paired with its own selfie flash. For ease of use, there are gesture controlled selfie functions.. Camera apps includes Face Show, which auto generate selfie videos and Split Catcher, which creates multiple-view collages using both front and back cameras. Easy Shot, Pano (panorama) and Selfie Album are also included.. The Alcatel Shine Lite has a 2,460mAh capacity battery, which is pretty standard and middle of the road..

Mediatek MT6737 Quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A53. Alcatel Shine Lite Reviews - page 2. Alcatel Shine Lite is rated. Rated 5 out of. I buy it 1 week ago.it is good phone.. But I can't active finger print activated.. May be I don't known how to do it. Rated 2 out of. I bought this less than a year ago and I'm already having to get another phone. On most days the battery will take an hour just to go up 10%, the camera and microphone are awful, when I use it for too long or have my data on more than half an hour it gets too hot too handle without the case, it won't recognize any SD card I put in, the location is usually off by at least 10 feet (although usually more) which makes using maps nearly impossible and the left speaker stopped working a week after I bought it. Definitely not worth £120 even if all the features were working.. Rated 1 out of. Worse phone i have EVER come across. I bought this phone a couple of months ago and had nothing but trouble with it... Keeps freezing and pop ups can stop you answering it,. No decent phone covers for this phone ANYWHERE. they just don't make them so if your in construction or some other industry that would require a half decent phone case avoid this device as!!. I did set out to buy a Samsung but was talked into buying this by a staff member in shop... Hard to believe Nokia own Alcatel!!. Rated 5 out of. Currently Alcatel flagship phone is the Idol 5 which I would strongly recommend. However this midrange phone is something else, responsive, fast has many of the specs had the retired Idol 3 from around 2 years ago. You also seen it in the latest Transformers movie. Built wise the quality is incredible. I never had a phone with, a glass screen before. The only negative I have; I can't find an official case for it, not even online the Alcatel online web store, there are plenty of third party ones. You probably don't need a case because of the glass screen. If you find cheper deal than ours,We'll match it and pay your first monthly bill..

Zero, 15 Nov 2016 Is this already available on my country (Philippines) ??? Yes. I have the Optus X Sleek (carrier version of the 5080Q). I'm quite happy with this phone. Screen is ok (coming from 4 years of 1080p you do notice that its a 720 screen), the back camera is very disappointing as it is very slow to focus and the viewfinder is about a second behind what is actually happening. The phone is fine to use day to day, but can struggle a little if you are a fast typist. It has a much smaller battery than what I'm used to but easily lasts a full day.. Pages: 1 2 ».

Alcatel Shine Lite Review Source: Yugatech Itâs clear that Alcatel has managed to squeeze itself inside the crowded sub-Php10K segment with the Shine Lite. It is equipped with nice features like LTE, Dragontrail Glass, fingerprint scanner, and Android Marshmallow. However, most of its efforts are placed on the premium build which might shun users who prioritize performance over aesthetics after considering the price.

PCMag reviews products independently , but we may earn affiliate commissions from buying links on this page. BERLIN — The dream of the high-quality, $199 unlocked US phone continues. Here at IFA this week, we've seen midrange phones from ZTE , Huawei, and Sony at a wide range of price points. But Alcatel's Shine Lite comes in at $199-249 with a high-end metal-and-glass build, making it a real potential player. We spent a few minutes with it at the show.. Modest Specs, Expensive Feel The Shine Lite is not a spec powerhouse. It has a 5-inch 720p screen, 13-megapixel and 5-megapixel cameras, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of storage plus a microSD card slot. The processor is a quad-core Mediatek chip running at 1.3GHz, and the phone runs Android 6.0.. The exciting thing here is that the Shine Lite feels nice in the hand. It borrows a bunch of design cues from competitors like the Huawei Honor 8 all the way back to the iPhone 5. For starters, you feel no plastic. The front and back are both glass that curves slightly outward, blending smoothly into a polished metal bezel. There's a round fingerprint sensor on the back, in an intuitive position.. Alcatel didn't give the weight, but the Shine Lite feels heavy. I imagine it'll break easily, with all that glass, but it sure is pretty — and it sure doesn't look $199.. Maybe in the US Nicolas Zibell, Alcatel's president of international business, said the Shine Lite, "may come to a US carrier customer...we definitely have some demand in the US market for this one.". If ZTE is to be believed, Alcatel has been bumped from fourth to fifth place in the US, and a boost for a phone like the Shine Lite at Cricket or MetroPCS would certainly help its fortunes.. The Shine Lite will appear sometime after September.. Hands On With Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 VR. Hands On With Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 VR.

But Alcatel's Shine Lite comes in at $199-249 with a high-end metal-and-glass build, making it a real potential player. We spent a few minutes with it at the show.. Alcatel didn't give the weight, but the Shine Lite feels heavy. I imagine it'll break easily, with all that glass, but it sure is pretty—and it sure doesn't look $199.. If ZTE is to be believed, Alcatel has been bumped from fourth to fifth place in the US, and a boost for a phone like the Shine Lite at Cricket or MetroPCS would certainly help its fortunes.. The Shine Lite will appear sometime after September.. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments..

At IFA 2016, which will be held in Berlin from 2 to 7 September 2016, the company TCL Communication has introduced a new smartphone under brand Alcatel Shine Lite. Today we make a review of new smartphone Alcatel Shine Lite.. The Alcatel succeeded with IDOL 4, this model was the replacement of the flagships of famous companies, at a cost of 19 990 rubles it apart price / quality ratio and the fact that in Russia you can find it for less money, making it even more attractive. In parallel with this smartphone at Alcatel created a model Alcatel Shine Lite an idea which can be described as follows: the most affordable smartphone with quality materials, with a good display, normal cameras. Alcatel The task was simple – to create a smartphone that will attract those who are considering the price / quality ratio and unit plans to buy a model for a long time. This is a reasonable purchase, which, however, should not be deprived of the pleasant features of the older models. And it seems to me, here at Alcatel were able to achieve some success. From champions came a sound chip, which makes the sound more interesting device than all classmates at the same price. Excellent screen, though not with the maximum resolution. Very often, these products are a compromise, but Alcatel Shine Lite looks like a reasonable approach to the mid-segment model. This quest for the ideal in the segment up to $ 200. And reading smartphone from Alcatel proved to be very successful, however, everything in order.. Why this smartphone called the “glow”? The answer lies in the body, which is made of glass with rounded, popular 2.5D effect and the glass itself is traditional for us – Dragontrail. Oleophobic coating is present, but at the expense of the figure turns out that the body does not show traces of the hands, like we see in Honor 8, but it sets completely different level, their value varies twice. But look at them together, can we say that Alcatel looks much worse? I think that clearly highlight some of the devices can not.. The model comes in several colors, each looks quite interesting.. With dimensions 141.5h71.2h7.45 mm and weight of 156 grams is a compact and very convenient device, it fits easily in your hand. Molded housing, the build quality is excellent. Tray for SIM-card (nanoSIM) combined with a memory card.. On the right side is the on / off button, in the same volume button. fingerprint sensor is put to the back cover, this is a typical solution for Chinese companies. It should be noted that, unlike many budget models, there is a print sensor works fine, recognizes the finger and instantly unlocks the device.. On the upper and lower ends are placed microphones, noise reduction system works well. microUSB connector imposed on the lower end, 3.5 mm jack – at the upper end. Building on the fine, which is typical for Alcatel.. The front panel has a light indicator, it informs of missed events, but also it can be disabled in the menu.. Based on the performance in front of us ordinary IPS-display with a diagonal of 5 inch, HD-resolution and automatic adjustment of brightness. The screen is excellent and wins even Pop Series models, which are positioned above. I like his behavior in the sun, as well as how this device behaves in a room. For its level of the screen is very, very good.. The device is able to work a full day, with an average load at a moderate – 2 days. Capacity Li-Ion Battery – 2460 mAh. Claimed battery life in standby mode – up to 430 hours, talk time – up to 10 hours.. Continuous video playback time – 7 hours.. The phone has a built-in utility for power limitation (disables certain functions), it is enabled by default when you reach 15% charge. Also there was a “Optimizing battery”, in fact, this restriction background application performance, you can add or remove them from the list, something similar we see on Samsung’s flagship.. Full charging time – about 90 minutes, supported by Quick Charge technology.. The unit provides 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of built-in (system and applications take up about 5 GB), can be expanded with memory cards up to 128GB.. Chipset MediaTek MT6737, 4-core to 1.3 GHz. The average performance of solutions that can be seen in the synthetic tests. But in everyday life, in the menu, you will not notice it, it works quite quickly.. The front camera has a flash for the Self, its resolution – 5 megapixels. The standard for the latest generation of devices have uluchshalki skin, oval face, and similar stuff. The main camera has auto focus, resolution – 13 megapixels. The picture quality is not perfect, but very good for this level of device.. The model supports 4G (LTE FDD 1/3/7/8/20), also has NFC, Wi-Fi, BT 4.2, USB & BT Modem Tethering – in a word, a standard set of technologies, without any special features.. About the standard Android applications, there is no sense to speak separately, you can read about them in a separate review.. The Alcatel trying not much change the standard Android, but still bring their changes, including the Android 6. In the main menu mode from the icons have a circle, and when pressed opens a mini-window. Want to uncover the entire application – click on the button again.. The phone has FM-radio, a set of typical functions. Voice recorder, calculator, compass, and built-in memory manager.. On the role of music app launched “Mix”, it can not only listen to music, but also to mix it, apply different effects, turn the machine into a horizontal orientation sufficiently. Do I need it? For young people, such entertainment may be appropriate, but it is a toy, which should not be overestimated, become a DJ will not work with him, although understanding of this and can be formed. Unlike older IDOL, there is no separate EQ and volume control implemented poorer but have a built uluchshalka sound, which can include. The device sounds simpler than IDOL 4, but in class he clearly stands out on the music capabilities.. There is also a screen with various corporate news, exchange rates, and applications, you can customize it on your own.. No complaints on the voice quality is not, the ringer volume is very good, it was clean and vociferous. Vibrating alert is average in power.. Alcatel Shine Lite will be available in October at a price of about 13 000 rubles. Who are obvious rival for her? We can recall similar characteristics model Samsung A5 2015, its cost in Russia – about 15 000 rubles. A little worse sound, no fingerprint sensor, but otherwise these devices are very similar.. An interesting alternative may be a ZTE Blade V7, in Euroset, he is the same 13 000 rubles. Slightly better than the screen resolution, but not the brightness and other parameters, simpler case, but there is a fingerprint sensor. Decent machine, but with a few design all boring.. As you can see, such devices on the market a lot, but they all tend to cost 15-16 thousand rubles with similar characteristics. Another important point, they can not boast of a combination of metal and glass, which we observe in Alcatel Shine Lite, and it highlights the model. The bottom line is it that the device looks nice, also it has an audio chip and running pretty quickly. Nice working machine at a reasonable price. It seems to me, in a segment of up to 13 000 rubles has turned a potential bestseller, which is precisely to pay attention..

This Alcatel phone has a high-end character but without a hefty price-tag, making it ideal for students or those looking to make the right impression at their first job.. New: Alcatel Shine Lite review. The Shine Lite joins Alcatel’s line up of 2017 smartphones, which most notably includes the Alcatel Idol 4 with VR headset .. There are several premium characteristics that make the Alcatel Shine Lite a desirable smartphone. The first of these is the selection of build materials:. The next premium characteristic of the Alcatel Shine Lite is the inclusion of a fingerprint sensor. The fingerprint sensor goes beyond simply unlocking the phone and can be set up to open your favourite apps.. It is possible to customise up to five fingerprints to open, even from the lock screen, the web browser, Facebook app or any other app of your choice. The fingerprint scanner can also be used to access the Safebox feature, where private documents, videos and images can be stored.. This affordable Alcatel phone has a camera with a high 13MP resolution. Tackling the most difficult of photography scenarios, low light, sees a dual-tone flash come into play for correctly balancing the lighting and capturing natural looking results.. The camera can record 720p (HD) video but can play 1080p (Full HD) videos, which is great for watching downloaded content, such as movies.. The 5MP selfie camera has gesture controlled selfie functions and a front (selfie) flash, usually only seen on premium smartphones. Apps includes Face Show, which auto generates selfie videos and Split Catcher, which creates multiple-view collages using both front and back cameras. Further camera apps includes Easy Shot, Pano (panorama) and Selfie Album.. Here are the remaining Alcatel Lite specifications:. Next news story: Fire extinguisher built into battery.
