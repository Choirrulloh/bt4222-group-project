By nirmal k mohan | 18 Feb 2017. Display is good even though it is 720p. Samsung is caliberated its display very well. Camera is decent in performance. It is provided with f1.9 aperture which gives you better pictures. Battery , surprisingly gives me a 2 days backup on moderate use. Somebody says 2GB RAM is not sufficient for an Android device. But after playing games like Modern Compact, Alphat8 I didn't feel any lag in its performance. They are provided a good charger so it takes me only 2.15 hours to take full charge a 3300mAh battery. Some time it may feel little warm while device is charging whichis common for a device. You may get mobile phones with same specifications paying less money, but I may say you won't regret buying this device.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 2 out of 2 people found this review helpful.

The Galaxy J7 (2016) sports a 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display with 720 x 1280 pixels, the device relies on an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6 GHz. The J7 (2016) further features LTE connectivity, NFC, 2GB of RAM, 16 GB of expandable storage space, and a 3300 mAh battery.. Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) Review Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) manual Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) benchmarks. Dimensions: 5.97 x 2.99 x 0.31 inches (151.7 x 76 x 7.8 mm). Weight: 5.96 oz (169 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 5.5 inches. Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus, CMOS image sensor. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Effects. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Octa-core, 1600 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 14 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 23.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 20. Data: LTE-A Cat 6 (300/50 Mbit/s), HSPA. Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: NFC, ANT+, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 28 Mar 2016. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. posted by Victor H.. Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction The Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016 edition, aka J7 6) represents the new generation of affordable Samsung phones: with a stylish look, a sturdy metal frame, and even with a few premium features like the Quick Launch camera shortcut. In a fiercely competitive Android phone market, the 5.5” Galaxy J7 6 has plenty of rivals, though, and many are coming at prices well below what Samsung has set here. Does the Samsung brand name, the more refined TouchWiz and the performance of the Galaxy J7 6 live up to expectations? We take a look at our in-depth review. In the box: Galaxy J7 2016 Wall charger (5V - 1.55A) microUSB to USB cable White Samsung earbuds User manual Design A metal frame is nice to have, but the design feels generic and the plastic back cover feels cheap. The Galaxy J7 6 is an evolution over the traditional look of plastic Samsung phones from way back in the day. In fact, save for the metal frame, it looks like your generic Samsung phone with that typical back layout with a silver speaker grill introduced way back in 2012, some four years ago. Yet, the metal frame carries the modern carve-outs we know from more modern Samsung phones, so all in all the design blends together the past and the present. From a purely practical standpoint, the J7 6 design works: it’s sturdy, with no screaky, hollow parts, and the back does not accumulate fingerprints. Yet, the plastic back cover feels decidedly cheap and the phone lacks flare. The buttons are well-crafted, though: all are made from metal and feel very clicky and nice to press. There’s a lock key on the right and two separate volume buttons on the left, while up front there is a single physical home key, but it’s just a regular button - no fingerprint here, sadly. On the bottom of the phone is a microUSB port for charging. In terms of size and heft, the J7 6 is well balanced for a 5.5” phone: it’s not too wide at 2.99 inches (76mm) and thickness comes in at the rather thin 7.8mm. The phone tips the scales at 169g, which is neither too heavy, nor too light for a phone this size. Display The 5.5” 720 x 1280-pixel screen is not super-sharp, and its colors are a bit off, but the big shock is that there’s no ambient light sensor! Come on, Samsung! The Galaxy J7 6 sports a 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels. That works out to 267ppi, which in simple terms means that on this display you can notice some slight pixelization and the screen won’t look as sharp as on higher-end phones. What about the colors, though? Samsung’s AMOLED displays come with the neat option for users to choose how the screen looks. The default ‘Adaptive’ display mode features unrealistically oversaturated colors and bluish whites, which combine for a very punchy, but wildly unrealistic, cartoony look to everything. We switch all of our Samsung AMOLED displays to the ‘Basic’ mode (you do this by going into Settings - Display - Screen Mode), as this is the mode that comes closest to the sRGB color standard, the de facto standard for all images and video on the web and on Android. Sticking with Basic Mode and the sRGB standard means that you see images the way those who captured those images intended you to see them. Still, the Galaxy J7 6 does not have its colors properly balanced in this mode, and it’s a bit off: blues are mostly accurate, but reds and greens are off target. Whites are also slightly, but noticeably greenish here. The J7 6 also does not have the brightest of screens: outdoors, on a sunny day, we found it hard to read content on the display and we had to shield it with our hand. Viewing angles are not bad, though, as brightness is retained at different angles. We left the biggest shocker, however, for last: the J7 6 has no ambient light sensor! Preposterous? Yes! This is not the cheapest of phones, yet it lacks the essential option to have automatic brightness adjustments! Having to manually adjust brightness is not only inconvenient, but it can also lead to high brightness levels used longer, causing battery life to take an unnecessary hit. Instead of the Auto toggle we're used to having, there's a strange 'Outdoor' mode, which bumps the brightness up upon activation, and then disengages automatically after a short while. From the looks of the sensors lined up across the phone's upper bezel, it appears that there is, in fact, an ambient light sensor, but the option to activate it isn't available, and diagnostic tools like CPU-Z don't seem to detect such a component either. Another compromise comes in the oleophobic coating on the J7 6. It seems that it’s either not there, or very weak, as the phone catches fingerprints on the display very easily and often looks depressingly smudgy and dirty.. 5.97 x 2.99 x 0.31 inches. 151.7 x 76 x 7.8 mm. 5.7 x 2.8 x 0.29 inches. 144.8 x 71 x 7.3 mm. 5.91 x 2.99 x 0.34 inches. 150 x 76 x 8.65 mm. 6.05 x 2.97 x 0.32 inches. 153.6 x 75.5 x 8.2 mm.

Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The numbers below represent the amount of deviation in the respective property, observed when a display is viewed from a 45-degree angle as opposed to direct viewing.. Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) Compare.

Ambient Light Senson is Useless Crap. Touchwiz offers a quick way to change Brightness that is far better than Light sensor that never ever works. PA says Phone is too quiet amd it is loudest among others they mention. It could have had a lowet price. But considering what LG, Sony, Htc have been offering, its actually cheap. Even Samsung has not offered something so good at this price. Battery life in reality is far better than even Redmi Note 3 that drain as soon as it start heating which happens when browsing heavy sites and gaming. Also J7s max temp while hardcore gaming for long was 37 C in India. Here ambient temp is about the same..

I like that the camera of the Galaxy J7 6 is better than my Note 3. -Full Camera2 API Support with Manual Camera (Other apps lack some features). -Great for Selfie and Vlogging (With Gyro Stabilizer). -1080p display on China models(WTF Samsung). -No Gyroscope (3rd party Panorama app become useless). -NFC tag is on the back cover(Most prone to damage).

First of all, plastic helps disolve the temperature; secondly, hd screen saves battery and temperature, it is as good as Full Hd, for normal human being; For last, complaining about 4K video, your kidding? you got right only when talking about fingerprint scanner. This phone deserves a much better rating!. (Posts: 8; Member since: 20 Mar 2015). posted on 30 Aug 2016, 12:21. Wanna try this as my first Android phones...

Samsung has been lately making some changes in its hierarchy of smartphones and while the Galaxy stays, the handset manufacturer is coming up with sub series like Galaxy A, Galaxy Note, Galaxy S and the most recent addition is Galaxy J. The South Korean handset maker has recently announced two new revamped devices under J series viz. 2016 editions of J5 and J7. Both these devices boasts of some serious specifications that make them a good option to consider in mid range. The Galaxy J7 (2016) is the higher end variant of the two and a powerful device to reckon.. Front Flash: Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) is one of the limited budget segment smartphone that comes with front selfie snapper with an accompanying LED flash. It makes Galaxy J7 a better selfie smartphone with excellent low light selfie capturing.. Ultra Data Saving: This is a new feature added by the South Korean handset maker for those who are heavy Internet browser and would like to save on their data usage. The Ultra Data Saving feature compresses data and restrict background data usage to improve standby time and RAM usage.. Sharp AMOLED Display: The Super AMOLED display is the signature technology from Samsung, which makes for an ultra sharp and vivid viewing experience. Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) has also been equipped with this display, which makes for a good viewing experience despite the low pixel density.. All New TouchWiz UI: The 2016 edition of Galaxy J7 comes with the improved Samsung Touchwiz UI, which is said to have lesser bloatware then usual. This means that the handset does not eat up RAM and lag on account of its interface.. S-Bike Mode: This feature has been newly introduced by the South Korean handset maker in the refreshed version of Galaxy J7. This feature allows the device owner to take calls while riding or avoid taking the same.. Slippery Metal build: The sleek metal chassis of Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) might make it feel more premium but it also tends to make the handset quite slippery. In case you are not opting for a case to protect the device, you are more likely to drop it more than once.. No Gorilla Glass : One of the major drawback of Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) is that the display of this handset is not protected by Corning Gorilla Glass layer. So, in case of an accidental drop, you can expect the device display to shatter completely, 9 out of 10 times..

It usually happens since metal is a good conductor of heat and disperse it faster, as a result of which it feels hotter to touch.. Samsung Galaxy J7 2016 Price in India. 13,800 .00.

BASED ON 19,995 RATING(S). 15 May 2016 By Mallikarjuna Rao On flipkart.com. Good phone but with drawbacks Laymans review. I see a lot of positive reviews here.Makes it look like a perfect phone.I would like to highlight some cons in my review nConsn----------------------------------- n1. 720p display nIn the generation where 10k price phones have 1080p displays, a 720p display in 5.5 inch screen is simply ridiculous.Viewing angles are worse.My display gives a rainbow-ish tint when viewed sideways(might be AMOLED display flaw ?). On the flip side, lesser resolution requires less power from battery, so its a trade-off. nnn2.No magnetic sensornThis means maps wont rotate according to your motion. VR videos on facebook won't work.In the generation of Oculus and VR, this is unacceptable nnn3.No notification LEDnMy previous phone has a notification LED & I now recognise its importance nnn4.Poor UI/UX with samsung touchwiznThe design of touchwiz is very sub-standard compared to stock android,ios or HTC sense. nnn5.BloatwarenRidiculous amount of inbuilt apps from Samsung which eat up the already less 16GB internal memory.Camera app is very laggy. nnn6.Poor quality speaker and bundled earphones nSpeakers on the phone are very bad.So is the sound quality though earphones(tested with good quality earphones) nnn7. nSo short that it can't reach the phone on your desk from standard plug point nnn8.Heats up a little nGets hot , but I think it is OK with smartphones. nnn9.Slippery/Soft back and sidesnWith no cases yet available on the market, this is a big issue with that huge phone size nnn10.No backlight on capacitive keys nnn11.Build quality looks cheapnEven with the aluminium on the sides, it does not feel premium to hold. Packaging of this phone and accessories is so very cheap.Check some unboxing videos to see it yourself. nnn12.Bit costly nThis is debatable, but with these many cost cuttings this price is nowhere justify able. Front flash for you selfie expertsn3. Light weight, thin and super fastn4. Good after-sales service by Samsung nnnOverall Verdict : Good phone if you know what you are getting into.. 11 May 2016 By Chakri On flipkart.com. Nice Looking and Long Battery Phone. Just now i have received my J7 6. Earlier I was used J7, comparing to the J7 6 to old J7 it has minor changes but powerful changes i.e Battery,Processor,Ram,Marshmallow (OS),Metalic Design except these changes remain all are same. Some of the pitfalls still came with J7 6 from old J7nthose aren1. not full HDnnThese are the observations i had done. I will post my complete review after 1 month..

I do not. i want to connect to a normal led TV and using Mirascreen devise. How to use SMART VIEW option (SM-J710FN) this model? Do you want to connect your phone to samsung smart tv ?. How to use SMART VIEW option (SM-J710FN) this model?. Anyone using Simple Basic theme (AOD) by MIZI (full black), please share me link.. I installed the update and from what i could spot it did indeed improve my device a lot. So my model number is SM-J710F.Anyone in UAE (And those who have that model too,no matter if they live/don't live in UAE,just like me)should get this update. The current baseband version is (for me atleast): J710FXXU4BRA5. The update installed successfully, nothing wrong happened.My device did indeed heat up a bit while it was in the process of installing the update which is pretty normal. Battery backup seems fine,and so does the charging time i guess. After the update i noticed the ram management was indeed improved much and now my device feels way faster and apps load way faster. One thing i noticed in the system memory was before installing the update i had like 1.1GB of free memory and now I've got 3GB free.It's because of the bugfixes,and i suppose there's more avaiable ram. Received 302.21 MB update out here in Macedonia.Version as it says in the update is J710FXXU4BRA2/J710FOJV4BRA1/J710FXXU4BRA5. My current version(before the update)is: J710FXXU3BQH2. My model is SM-J710 from UAE.So far the device works smooth and hopefully this update will improve the ram management.Going to install it now and tell you what'll happen later!. sm-j7108 of 3gb ram no nougat.

Adrian Diaconescu March 29, 2016 3:18 am. Samsung probably missed the optimal window for announcing its latest additions to the mid-range Galaxy J smartphone family, as the J5 (2016) and especially the J7 (2016) garnered decent buzz at one point in the rumor mill.. But in recent weeks, the hype slowly waned, and so ultimately, the world-leading Korean OEM decided to go with a simple, quiet, low-key introduction of the two devices on the company’s official Chinese website.. Most of the specifications stopped being a secret weeks or even months ago, but what we didn’t expect was seeing the rear-facing cameras flanked by LED flashes and… boring speakers. Drat, we really thought those were laser autofocus photography augmentations.. On the bright side, the Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) does look like a healthy upgrade over last year’s J7 all in all, with 3GB RAM instead of 1.5, a sharp 5.5-inch Full HD display in tow, octa-core 1.6GHz processor (Exynos 7870?) under the hood, and a 3,300 mAh battery in charge of keeping the lights on.. Unfortunately, the pre-loaded Android iteration isn’t listed, which seems like tacit confirmation of 5.1 Lollipop, and design-wise, we can’t say we notice a great deal of distinctions between the 2016 and 2015 J7.. The same goes for the Galaxy J5 (2016), the sequel to one of Samsung’s most surprising box-office hits of last year, which looks eerily familiar, probably runs Lollipop, and doesn’t change much in terms of specs.. You get 13 and 5MP cameras (both with LED flash), 2GB RAM, a quad-core 1.2GHz SoC, 5.2-inch 720p screen, 3,100 mAh battery, 4G LTE connectivity, and 16GB expandable storage.. There are no words on pricing yet, not even for China, and we don’t know whether the two new J-series products will ever make it to Western shores. Most likely, but we can’t be sure of anything..

YOUTUBE / Gadgets Portal A screengrab from a video review on the specs and features of the Samsung Galaxy J7 smartphone.. Share on facebook Share on twitter. Share Email Print Share Tweet Pin Linkedin Google+ Reddit. By Lorraine Caballero , Christian Post Contributor | Feb 17, 2016 3:48 AM. Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) could be released before this year ends, but not until after the Galaxy S7 is out in the market.. Samsung is set to unveil the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge on Feb. 22 during the Mobile World Congress, and the new flagship units could be available in stores two months after that. The South Korean tech giant may be trying to draw attention away from its flagship units by unveiling the Galaxy J7 (2016) in May or June, according to the Master Herald .. If Samsung indeed introduces the Galaxy J7 (2016) by midyear, then the midrange smartphone will be released to the market a year after its predecessor came out last year. Although some manufacturers release a successor to a unit after six months, most allow a year to pass before a new version is released, the report explains.. However, Samsung has not yet announced an official release date for the new J7, Jobs & Hire. The Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) will reportedly have two versions that will each feature different processors but will both have 5.5-inch displays and a micro-SD card slot for expansion of storage. Both will boast of a 13-megapixel rear shooter and 5-megapixel front camera, the report details.. The first version will make use of an Exynos 7870 chip with 2 GB of RAM and 720-pixel screen resolution. The second version will use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 with 3 GB of RAM and 1080-pixel resolution, the report relays.. In addition, the Galaxy J7 (2016) is expected to run the Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system. The upcoming phone will reportedly come with a price range of $200 to $280. If this is true, then the 2016 edition will be cheaper than the 2015 version, which has a price tag of $290.. The Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) will be available in four color variants including white, black, gold, and rose gold.. Share on facebook Share on twitter.

Review On Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016). Victor Thomson , Jun 16, 2016 06:28 AM EDT. According to reviews, the Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) comes with a sturdy frame, a stylish look and a few premium features.. Mobipicker reports that the generation of Samsung's mid-range J series was released just a couple of months ago. The new J series comes with a number of improvements, compared to the previous generation.. The most notable changes were made in terms of the chipset capacity of RAM memory used. The top model from J series is the Galaxy J7 2016. It comes with the best components used and the biggest screen. The 2016 version is a good leap forward from the previous version of the Galaxy J7, to justify the bigger price.. According to Phone Arena , the performance of the Galaxy J7 2016, the more refined TouchWiz and the Samsung brand name live up to expectations. The device is an evolution over the traditional plastic look of Samsung phones.. The Galaxy J7 2016 comes with a metal frame, with a silver speaker grill. The phone is sturdy, without hollow parts. The buttons are well-crafted, being made from metal. A microUSB port for charging is located on the bottom of the phone.. The new J7 is well balanced for a 5.5-inch device. In terms of size, the phone is 2.99 inches (76mm) wide. It is neither too light, nor too heavy at its 169g weight.. The Galaxy J7 6 features a Super AMOLED display that works out to 267ppi pixel density and a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels. The screen size and resolution are good enough for most users, even if not the highest ones among the offers on the market.. The Galaxy J7 2016 comes powered by the Exynos-Octa CPU clocked at 1.6Hz. The chipset is powerful enough for all the usual tasks users might be performing on their phone, including most of the games. The Antutu performance score for the Samsung Galaxy J7 2016 is 44,500..
