CNET también está disponible en español.. Beautiful and cheap, with a baffling lack of wide LTE support. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The inexpensive OnePlus X is fast, beautifully designed and has some nifty customizable features.. The Bad The glossy handset is slippery and has limited compatibility with key LTE bands in the US.. The Bottom Line The OnePlus X is one of the best budget phones of the year, but its limited LTE support make it a crapshoot for US customers who want high-speed data.. How much is it and how to get it. Design and build: High-class looks for a low cost 5-inch display with 1,920x1,080-pixel resolution and 441ppi pixel density 5.5 by 2.7 by 0.27 inches (140 by 69 by 6.9mm) Onyx: 4.86 ounces (138 grams); Ceramic: 5.64 oz. Software and other features: Colorful, clean and customizable OnePlus' Oxygen operating system Based on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop Ambient display and FM radio app. I was ready to crown the OnePlus X as one of the best budget smartphones of 2015. Compared to other $250 unlocked devices, it's more powerful than the Motorola Moto G , more beautiful than the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 and runs a more updated OS than the Huawei P8 Lite. With its stylish design and faster speed than its rivals, I was ready to buy into the OnePlus motto to "never settle.". If you live in the US (and in some parts of North America), like I do, you might have to settle for slower data speeds. That's because the OnePlus X won't work on a couple of important LTE bands used by US carriers AT&T and T-Mobile. Though I personally experienced stable data speeds, many others reported spotty and slow data coverage.. If having inconsistent LTE doesn't bother you that much, or you live outside the US (in which case this shouldn't be a problem, and you can easily cross reference with your provider's bands to see if your OnePlus X is compatible), the handset is a terrific phone with big value. But if you're in the US and having solid LTE is a crucial, it's best to look elsewhere than risk the possibility of surfing with sluggish data.. Editors' Note: This review has been updated on January 28, 2016 to reflect OnePlus' elimination of its invite-only policy .. OnePlus X: Expensive looks with a low price (pictures). As with its other phones, OnePlus made the X available by invite only (and it was invite-free temporarily from December 5-7 ). But as predicted, the company has now lifted its policy and now you can buy it without an invitation.. Unlocked, the X costs $249 and £199 (which converts to about AU$430). A special ceramic edition (more on that later) will be available only in Europe and India. That one will cost £269 in the UK or €369.. Similar with its first two smartphones, OnePlus made the X available through invite only. It is now available for purchase without one.. Compared to the 2, which starts at $330, £239 (or about AU$450 converted) for the 16GB version, and $390, £289 (or about AU$535) for the 64GB model, the X is an even bigger value than its flagship counterpart. True, it's smaller and has scaled down hardware all around, but it does give you more bang for your buck -- especially when consider it also has expandable memory (which the marquee handset doesn't have).. Lastly, because OnePlus is a burgeoning mobile manufacturer based in China, you should bear in mind that its customer support may not be as far-reaching or fast as big-name companies such as Apple, Google and Samsung. That's not to say it's completely nonexistent, and indeed the company's website lists a support number, a live-chat tool and a way for users to file a support ticket. But it's something to consider if you need quick and easy access to a company rep should you need to troubleshoot a problem, report a repair or check your warranty.. The attractive device sports a slim, elegant design with glossy glass panels on the front and back, and a surrounding silver metal trim. It's reminiscent of a bigger, sleeker Apple iPhone 4 , and I think it looks more polished and refined than the OnePlus 2. But while its aesthetic is sophisticated and pleasing, it collects fingerprints easily and it's quite slippery. Every time I held it I worried it would slip through my grip. Maybe it's all myh past experiences with glass-clad devices -- like the aforementioned iPhone 4 and that time my Google Nexus 4 cracked from a 2-inch fall -- but I was also a little anxious when I held the handset.. The phone comes in two design variants: Onyx, which has a glass display that smoothly curves down the edges of the phone, and the more expensive Ceramic, which has angled edges. The two versions are hardly discernible, but the latter does catch and reflect light in interesting ways. OnePlus manufactured just 10,000 units of Ceramic, so if you want that one, good luck.. The phone's two design variants: the angled-glass Ceramic (left) and Onyx, which has smoother glass panels.. Even though it's not the more premium version of the two, the smoothness of the glass feels more attractive to the touch, and I just think it looks better up close. And compared to other budget phones, it's one of the best looking in its price bracket. It raises the bar on what you expect a "cheap" handset to look like, and its solid build quality definitely feels more expensive than its $249 price tag.. OnePlus is also selling rear covers that come in several colors and materials besides the usual plastic, including wood, bamboo and kevlar.. On the left is a physical button that you can toggle to turn on and off notifications and sounds. Overall, the buttons stick out from the surface, which makes them easy to use by feel, but also easy to accidentally activate while it's rattling inside a bag or backpack. That's bad news when the device turns itself on and drains its battery when you're not using it. I had one instance when the handset was completely out of power one morning, even though I didn't use it at night and kept it in my backpack. Unlike the OnePlus 2's USB Type-C port, the X has a more common (but less cutting edge) Micro-USB port (that's the one used by most Android phones today).. Unlike the OnePlus 2, the X has a Micro-USB port for charging and transferring files.. For the first time, OnePlus is switching up its display, from the usual LCD, which you find on phones like the LG G4 , to an AMOLED display, which Samsung and Microsoft Lumia phones have. This mostly won't mean much to you, but if you were to hold LCD and AMOLED phones side by side, you'd see blacker blacks and better image contrast. AMOLED phones are also said to help save on battery, though gains are more incremental than not; we're not talking hours of battery saving, here. At any rate, the X's screen is sharp and bright, and images were very clear. Games and videos in high-definition were vibrant and comfortable to watch, and text and app icons looked smooth. White hues, however, did come off a bit blue. This can be adjusted with the X's "color correction" feature nestled in its Accessibility menu, but even the device notes this option is "experimental and may affect performance.". The phone runs OnePlus' OxygenOS, which is proprietary software based on Android 5.1. One of the best things about OxygenOS is how easy it is to customize. It's neat that you're able to choose the accent color for your menu items, or the many colors that LED light will flash depending on the type of notification you receive. You can choose whether you want to navigate the X using physical buttons below the screen, or through on-screen controls instead. In addition, you can customize what each of these keys does when you double-tap or long press it.. Like the Google Nexus and Motorola Moto devices, the X lets you know you've missed notifications by flashing on your lock screen when you approach your handset. There are a couple of useful gesture controls too that you can use while your display is sleeping. For instance, you can double tap to wake up the screen (a feature included on many LG phones), draw an O shape to launch the camera, or turn on the flashlight in a pinch by writing a V on the screen.. The handset's shelf homepage (left) and the OnePlus radio app.. The OS features an extra homepage called "shelf" that gives you quick access to your recent apps, favorite contacts and any other widgets you want to add. As for bloatware, the X fortunately doesn't have much. Other than OnePlus Radio, an FM radio app that features an attractive minimalistic design and bold neon colors, you'll get Google staples like the Chrome Web browser, Gmail, Hangouts, YouTube and more. If you're already an Android user, it shouldn't take any time for you get to know this device.. One thing to note, however, is that the handset doesn't have a Near Field Communication chip, which allows it to communicate wirelessly with other NFC-enabled objects. This isn't necessarily a deal-breaker, but NFC is considered a standard among smartphones these days and it's a bit of a bummer that the X doesn't have it.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

The OnePlus X was an Android smartphone developed by OnePlus. [3] It was released on 29 October 2015, three months after the release of the company's second flagship, the OnePlus 2 on July 27. The OnePlus X was available in three design options: Onyx (black), Champagne (white), and a limited edition Ceramic version. [5] OnePlus has stated that the Ceramic OnePlus X will only be released in Europe with a limited run of only 10,000 units. [6] The OnePlus X originally required an invitation to be purchased, but as of January 28, 2016, invitations are no longer necessary to purchase the device. 1 Development and launch. 2 Release and distribution. 3.1 Design and hardware. Shortly after the launch of the OnePlus 2, OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei hinted at the launch of a new device at the end of 2015 when interviewed at one of the popup events in New York City. [8] After months of speculation by the media, the OnePlus X was officially unveiled on 29 October 2015. It was subsequently praised by reviewers and critics alike for its elegant looking design and high quality build. [9] [10] The price of the phone was announced at $249 for the unlocked version, making it a relatively affordable phone. [11] The Ceramic version of the phone comes in at $399 and features a ceramic back baked over a 25-day manufacturing process, which OnePlus claims was the first of its kind for a smartphone material. Four days after the release of the phone, the company also released an extended warranty programme called On-Guard for users in Europe and India. It gives new OnePlus 2 and OnePlus X users coverage from device breakage, liquid damage, accidental damage, and vandalism among others. [14] [15] The On-Guard extended warranty can be purchased along with the device for an additional fee that entitles the user of the handset to free service and repairs for a period of either 12 or 24 months, depending on the warranty plan purchased. As with all other OnePlus phones released thus far, the OnePlus X required an invitation to be purchased. [17] Despite heavy criticism over the invitation system, OnePlus has claimed that it was necessary practice for the startup to manage product flow and prevent overstocks from occurring, hence the implementation of the system on all its phones. OnePlus has announced open sales for the OnePlus X after the initial month of sales that was strictly invitation based. [19] Open sales will allow buyers to purchase the phone without an invitation, and will be held every week on specific dates of December that are yet to be announced by OnePlus. [20] Open sales are also held in OnePlus' pop-up events in various cities held by company employees. [21] The company was also keeping Open Sales events every Tuesday in India, while keeping invitation-system intact for rest of week days. Starting from 28 January 2016 it was completely invitation free. The design of the OnePlus X features a smooth glass back with textured aluminium bezels which provides a good grip on the frame of the phone. [23] Both versions of the phone feature a dark glass back reminiscent of the glass back on the iPhone 4. [24] The phone inherits the alert slider first found on the OnePlus 2 which toggles between All, Priority Only and No notifications. [25] Due to the smaller form factor of the phone the internal battery was smaller compared to the OnePlus 2, coming in at 2,525 mAh compared to the latter's 3,300 mAh battery. [26] The lower price of the phone also meant that the fingerprint sensor previously present on the OnePlus 2 has been omitted along with other features like optical image stabilization and swappable back covers. Oddly, the USB-C connector of the OnePlus 2 has not been carried over to the OnePlus X and the phone uses the micro USB instead of the newer USB-C connector. [27] OnePlus has released textured back covers for the OnePlus X which resemble the styles of the swappable StyleSwap Covers for the OnePlus 2 with Bamboo, Rosewood, Black Apricot and Kevlar backs. With a 5" AMOLED 1920 × 1080 Full HD resolution screen protected by Corning Gorilla Glass , the OnePlus X was a departure from both the OnePlus One and OnePlus 2 which featured a larger 5.5" LCD panel with the same resolution. [29] Despite the smaller form factor, users still have the option of choosing between hardware capacitive buttons or on-screen customisable navigation " soft keys ". The OnePlus X was available in Onyx and Ceramic versions with each sporting different unique backs and a slightly different colour. [31] Manufacturing the ceramic version requires a process which was 25 days long and the company has stated that it will have a limited run of only 10,000 units. [32] The ceramic version was slightly heavier at 160. oz) and it will only be sold in Europe and India as announced by OnePlus. [33] Despite being a design-centric device as advertised by OnePlus, the phone packs quite a punch with relatively powerful internal specs which was similar to last generation flagships like the OnePlus One and LG G3. [34] The OnePlus X features 16. GB of internal storage with 3. GB LPDDR3 RAM and the handset was powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 32-bit quad-core chip clocked at 2.3 GHz with an Adreno 330 graphics processor. Other features include FM radio and a dual SIM ( nano SIM ) card layout with 4G LTE compatibility which can be swapped to include a micro SD storage card in the 2nd SIM slot for the adding of removable storage. [36] As with the OnePlus 2, NFC was not available on the OnePlus X. The OnePlus X has been tested on the AnTuTu Benchmark test and it yields a score of 45000+ points, on par with similar devices powered by the Snapdragon 801 quad core processor. Unlike the earlier OnePlus 2 , since OnePlus X does not support any 700. MHz LTE frequency bands (namely, LTE Band 12 and 17, used by T-Mobile US and AT&T LTE networks, respectively), rural and indoor reception may be poor in the United States, especially in the case of T-Mobile US network, where LTE Band 12 was the only sub-1. OnePlus X was also released in White (Champagne Edition) for other countries like India, after keeping it exclusive for home country China. Other than color difference, there isn't any difference in the device.. The OnePlus X comes preloaded with Oxygen OS version 2.1.2, OnePlus's build of Android 5.1.1 "Lollipop". On 4 August 2016, OnePlus began rolling out version 2.2.2 of Oxygen OS for OnePlus X. The update brings some bug fixes along with changes to camera UI and inclusion of Android's July security patch. On 28 September 2016, OnePlus started rolling out version 2.2.3 of Oxygen OS for OnePlus X. The update comes with Android's September security patch and necessary dependencies for Android Marshmallow upgrade. On 1 October 2016, OnePlus started rolling out version 3.1.3 of Oxygen OS for OnePlus X.

OnePlus managed to make a great phone at an even lower price, but but unlike its strong marketing message on previous phones this isn't a flagship killer — it's just a normal inexpensive phone, and that means you'll absolutely have to settle.. Just over three months after the unveiling of the OnePlus 2, we're getting yet another OnePlus model — but this isn't replacing the flagship killer, it's going after a new market entirely. No longer required to have an invite to buy the OnePlus X.

Review Update: As of January 28, 2016 the OnePlus X is available invite-free. Regular consumers can now get their hands on OnePlus’ first mid-range smartphone without needing an invite. OnePlus has always used the invite system for its previous handsets on release, with the OnePlus One and OnePlus 2 eventually being made invite-free.. The OnePlus X was made invite-free 92 days after its release, marking the shortest switch to regular retail for one of the firm’s handsets. The OnePlus One took 362 days to go invite-free, while the OnePlus 2 took 130.. The OnePlus X is yet to receive an update to Google’s latest Android Marshmallow operating system, which launched alongside the Google Nexus 6P and Google Nexus 5X in 2015. It has however received a smaller update to OnePlus Oxygen OS Android Skin. The update fixes a handful of the bugs and performance judders mentioned in the full review.. OnePlus confirmed via a post on the company’s forums, that an Android Marshmallow update will be released for its OnePlus 2 and OnePlus One in Q1 2016. However, no time-frame was given for a OnePlus X rollout. With a track record for making stellar handsets at incredibly low prices, OnePlus is one of the hottest smartphone makers at the moment. With the OnePlus X, the company continues this legacy, providing consumers with a genuinely impressive mid-range handset.. At £200, the OnePlus X is only £40 cheaper than the company’s flagship OnePlus 2 , which comes with a big bump in hardware. This has led some to question whether we need the slightly cheaper OnePlus X at all. Thankfully, using the phone proves why such scepticism isn’t really warranted. OnePlus has really done a fantastic job with its first mid-range handset. OnePlus made a big deal about the OnePlus X’s design, claiming it to be the first “truly premium affordable smartphone” at its London launch. The OnePlus X is available in two variants: Onyx and Ceramic. The Ceramic version is the more premium of the two, made using a laborious crafting process that OnePlus claims takes 25 days.. The process begins with a zirconia mould that’s fire-baked up to 1,482 o C for more than 28 hours. It’s then cooled for two days before going through a rigorous “polishing process”.. The OnePlus X Onyx retails at £199, while the OnePlus X Ceramic costs £269. If you want to get your hands on the Ceramic version, you’ll have a battle on your hands. The company is making a meagre 10,000 Ceramic units and will continue running a strict invite-only sales model until stocks run dry.. It will be much easier to get your mitts on the Onyx. OnePlus has confirmed plans to ditch its Willy Wonka golden ticket purchase model – which allows only those with an invite to buy – one month after the phone’s launch. Thereafter, the company will hold weekly flash sales where anyone will be able to purchase the phone. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

It features identical internal specifications to the Onyx, with the only major difference being that the Ceramic version has slightly more rounded sides and is 22g heavier than the Onyx.. The Onyx version is fairly well built and has a radically different feel to past OnePlus phones I’ve reviewed. Unlike the OnePlus 2, which features a velcro-like finish to the backplate, the Onyx OnePlus X has a non-removable, smooth finish. The cut-glass backplate is housed in an anodized metal frame. This combination makes for a phone that feels noticeably more expensive than it is.. The metal frame has a unique grooved finish that makes the handset comfortable to hold. It also hits the same sweet spot as the Nexus 5X , measuring a small-hand-friendly 140 x 69 x 6.9mm.. The OnePlus X’s comfy feel is further aided by its intelligent button placement. The phone’s power and volume buttons sit on the OnePlus X’s right, while a custom “alert slider” can be found on its left.. The alert slider is a novel design feature that lets you quickly set the phone to silent, priority or tell-me-everything modes. The modes control which notifications the phone will push and alert you about.. I found the slider to be a seriously useful feature, which made it quick and easy to set my phone to silent. I regularly used it when going into meetings or into the cinema.. OnePlus has also loaded the X with a microSD card, which will enable users to bump up the phone’s built-in 16GB of memory to 128GB.. So far, so positive – but I do have a couple of issues with the OnePlus X design.. The glass back looks great out of the box, but is a magnet for fingerprints and smudges. Within two seconds of picking it up, the phone looked grubby.. I’m also slightly disappointed to discover a micro-USB, as opposed to a USB C, port along the bottom edge of the phone.. USB C is a new connector technology designed to replace the older micro-USB standard. It offers a number of technical advantages, including faster data transfer speeds. It appeared on the OnePlus 2, and I’m a little sad to see it absent on the OnePlus X.. Neither of these issues are deal-breakers, but they’re slight annoyances that may put off some buyers.. The OnePlus 2 is a great smartphone, but I felt its 5.5-inch LCD, IPS, LTPS screen could be better. Sure it’s sharp and offers decent blacks, but the entire display lacks any real pop, and colours can on occasion look washed out compared to more expensive handsets such as the Samsung Galaxy S6 .. Which is why I was initially happy to see that OnePlus has switched to using AMOLED screen tech on the OnePlus X.. AMOLED technology enables the display to produce deeper and richer blacks. It does this by electrically charging each individual pixel to generate colours, meaning all the screen has to do is stop charging them to create blacks. The deeper blacks in turn make colours pop and improve the screen’s overall performance, making it look more dynamic. The tech means that the OnePlus X’s 5.0-inch display can produce wonderfully deep blacks. The 1080p screen is also razor sharp, offering up dazzling levels of brightness.. I’m not completely sold on the screen’s colours, though. AMOLED screens have a tendency to produce oversaturated colours – remember the 2015 Nexus 6 ? Sadly, this is the case with the OnePlus X.. Some will like the extra pop of the colours on the screen, but I’d have preferred the OnePlus X to have a slightly cooler display.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ hands-on: The devil is in the details. With its first two phones, OnePlus proved that it could deliver flagship-level devices at a cheaper price-point than most of its rivals. Neither were exactly design duds, but for its third handset -- and the second to be unwrapped in 2015 -- OnePlus is focusing on style in particular. It's called the OnePlus X and yes, it has a hint of both the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 about it. There are two models: the $249/£199 Onyx, which sports a sheet of black glass on the back, and a £269 Ceramic version, which won't be available in the US. In fact, OnePlus is only making 10,000 Ceramic handsets full-stop, so you'll have to be quick if you want one of the company's lucrative invites. Once again, OnePlus will be using an invite system to carefully manage customer demand and shipments.. Gallery: OnePlus X | 18 Photos. So what's inside? Premium components, but nothing that will give this year's crop of Android flagships any trouble. Underneath the 5-inch Full HD AMOLED panel is a Snapdragon 801 processor, which was common in 2014 flagships like the Sony Xperia Z3 and LG G3. There's also 3GB of RAM, a 2,525 mAh battery and a tray for two SIM cards. S pace might have been a concern, but thankfully the 16GB of onboard storage is backed up with microSD support up to 128GB. On the reverse you'll find a 13-megapixel camera -- no 4K video recording though -- coupled with an 8-megapixel snapper up front. Turn the phone on its side and you'll find the same alert slider pioneered on the OnePlus 2 -- this lets you switch between three different notification profiles on the fly, all without taking the device out of your pocket. That's not to say the OnePlus X is without some compromises though. There's no physical home button — so you can forget about fingerprint recognition -- and charging is handled over micro-USB, rather than USB-C like the OnePlus 2.. As for the software, OnePlus is sticking with OxygenOS , a mostly clean take on Android 5.1.1. It boasts all of the same software features as the OnePlus 2, save for one new addition -- OnePlus Radio. The app lets you connect to FM stations, which is no doubt aimed at users in emerging markets. It's not exciting, but we're happy with OnePlus' approach here -- there's just 16GB of onboard storage after all, so the less bloatware the better.. The OnePlus X isn't a replacement for the OnePlus 2. The company is treating this as entirely new smartphone line, aimed at people that are happy to sacrifice some power for a little more craftsmanship. At $249 (£199), it doesn't have much in the way of direct competition -- in Europe, its closest rivals will be the Wileyfox Storm, the Honor 7 and possibly the Moto X Play. The OnePlus X is more than a mid-range handset, but it's not quite another "flagship killer." It's somewhere in between, and that makes it all the more interesting. The device is set to launch in Europe and India on November 5th and comes to the US two weeks later. The Ceramic edition will be available from November 24th, although of course, both are dependent on you getting an invite. Even if you manage to snag one, there's no telling how long it'll take to actually arrive on your doorstep.. android , mobilepostcross , oneplus , oneplusx.

OnePlus have just done it for a third time and created a good phone for those on a budget. It doesn't have as many fancy features as the OnePlus 2, but for the price it's an impressive set up.. Hard to get a hold of. OnePlus had a happy 2014 thanks to its first phone, the OnePlus One , but 2015 was harder, with only a lukewarm reaction to the OnePlus 2. The Chinese company then brought out the OnePlus X towards the end of the year to see it into 2016 – and it's a phone with an even more attractive price tag than the flagship range.. The X saw the introdcution of a new 'budget' line for the still-young firm, and it's a chance to extend its customer base to those who like high-end specs and a nice design, but most of all a low, low price.. That price started at £199 ($249, about AU$350) – around the same as the Moto G 2015 , and undeniably great for the spec list, given that the OnePlus X is superior on paper to Motorola's cheapest handset, and most of the rest of the competition.. Since its launch the OnePlus X then dropped in price to £189 ($199, about AU$), but it's now no longer available from the Chinese firm's website. To be honest, you'll be lucky if you can find a brand new OnePlus X anywhere now.. A successor to the X looks unlikely too, with OnePlus confirming their focus on a sole flagship line during the launch of the OnePlus 3 in 2016.. The OnePlus X is one of the nicest looking phones to have come from the Chinese start-up so far - topped only by the OnePlus 3. The OnePlus 2 mirrored the OnePlus One quite closely, but the X has gone down a different path.. The OnePlus X features a glass back that looks great – at least until you start putting your hands on it. After using the phone for a few minutes, the back was covered in my grubby marks.. Although the back looks slippery, in use it always stayed safely in my hand.. Behind the glass sits the OnePlus logo that always turns heads of smartphone fans in the pub. Anticipation for these phones is so high that friends are genuinely excited to see one in the flesh.. The rounded corners at the edge of the screen remind me of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S , but I don't think they'd be particularly hardy. One drop is likely to scratch them up.. Black bezels sit across the top and bottom of the screen, and the capacitive back, home and list keys run along the bottom next to the microphone.. On the top bezel is the front-facing camera, earpiece and a little LED notification light in the top right. One of the OnePlus X's best tricks is that you can set different lights for different functions: one colour for notifications, and another for low battery.. This is useful, as you can know exactly what your phone wants to tell without turning on the display and wasting battery.. The edges of the OnePlus X are strange. OnePlus has opted for metal around the outside that feels more premium than the OnePlus 2, but it's a rough texture all the way around as well. When I first picked up the phone I wasn't impressed with this – but I've grown to really like this while using the OnePlus X.. On the top-left edge is the notification button, which proves quite useful. Whenever your phone is buzzing and you don't want to be disturbed, you can flick this to the off position to ensure you won't be bothered again.. On the right hand side is the volume rocker, with the power button just below it. I find these the wrong way round, to be honest. The power button is a little too low along the side of the phone, and I found myself hitting the rocker by accident on more than one occasion.. It's something I got used to with time though, and it's not a major gripe.. Surprisingly the OnePlus X isn't very heavy – it looks like it should weigh be more than the 138g it actually is. The phone sits in the hand really well, and is noticieably more comfortable than the slightly larger OnePlus One and OnePlus 2.. Overall, OnePlus has taken what made the iPhone 4 a great looking phone, blown it up a little, and applied its own tweaks to make a premium phone fit for the 2016 market.. I really like the design of the OnePlus X – and if you compare this look to other phones on the market, you won't find anything near this level of beauty at this price..

OnePlus managed to make a great phone at an even lower price, but in this case you absolutely have to settle.. Just like it's done with its previous phones, OnePlus is hitting a great price with the X while keeping the specs and experience on a higher level. The screen is great, the external hardware blows away other phones at this price, the software is fluid, and the internal specs are solid. To hit $249 there certainly were corners cut, but for the most part they're in relatively superficial areas — no 5GHz Wifi support, no Quick Charge, no NFC, and only offering 16GB of storage. Some of the corners — like lacking radio support for AT&T LTE and coming up short on the camera — matter a bit more. At this price, the OnePlus X is a great value — assuming you're not expecting all of the bells and whistles of a flagship phone.. After only releasing two phones prior to the X, the closest thing OnePlus has to an "identity" as a manufacturer (not to be confused with its identity as a company) is offering a great value for your money, but perhaps with a few odd omissions and hang-ups in the final product. The OnePlus X falls right into that same formula, but just a handful of months after its latest "flagship killer" was released, this phone has an entirely different mission — just be a good phone for the money, without all of the hype and crazy expectations.. With lower standards and a much lower price, OnePlus aimed to put its money where it matters on the X. The build, screen, internals and software clearly took priority here. The casualties in this equation are some of the smaller specs and features, which in the grand scheme of things vary in importance from "that's an odd decision" to "I can't believe they left that out.". But when you start to push the lower end of the market, these omissions are a bit more understandable. At $249 it's all about offering a good value even if there are a few hardware shortcomings. Does OnePlus accomplish that goal with the X? We're here to answer that question with our full review — read on.. I (Andrew Martonik) am writing this review after two weeks using the OnePlus X, running the latest software (that's OxygenOS 2.1.2). The phone was used primarily on T-Mobile for the review process, but was also tested for several days on AT&T — in both cases, in the greater Seattle area in locations with great service from both carriers. For a majority of the review, a Samsung Level Bluetooth headset was used on a daily basis.. 1080p resolution video; Slow Motion: 720p video at 120fps. Spending money in the right places. After getting my hands on a OnePlus 2 at its launch event back in July, it was clear that OnePlus had upped its hardware game. Thankfully, that improved design prowess has carried over to the OnePlus X, even at its lower price point. Even though we're looking at a phone that retails for $249 — $130 less than the flagship OnePlus 2 — it packs the same level of hardware componentry and high-tolerance manufacturing.. It's hardly a new design, but it's executed extremely well.. Using a basic design that takes two panes of glass and sandwiches between them a metal frame is hardly a new idea at this point, but it doesn't make it any less impressive when it's pulled off properly. It's even more impressive to see it in an inexpensive device such as this. The whole phone is pretty simplistically designed, skipping over unnecessary flourishes. All of the buttons and ports are in the standard places — power, volume and SIM slot on the right, the Alert Slider on the left, headphone on the top and micro USB (yes, not USB-C) on the bottom.. Though it's easier to grip because of its size, the smooth glass all over makes the X rather slick.. The exposed metal frame is chamfered nicely on the edges and sports etched lines around the entire perimeter to add a touch of differentiation but more importantly additional grip. The glass on both sides is nicely sculpted and smoothed down to meet the metal perfectly, and is only interrupted in two places — a small cutout for the phone speaker on the front, and one for the camera on the back. Otherwise, the OnePlus X is consistently smooth and slick all around, which can make it a tad tough to hold onto.. Unfortunately the glass back is problematic for keeping the phone safely on a flat surface as well. Because the back is completely flat (the camera doesn't protrude), the OnePlus X manages to slip around and slide off of flat surfaces. Much like the Nexus 4 , you can be startled by the sound of your OnePlus X falling onto the floor after you thought you had placed it on a table safely. My review unit took two such tumbles off of tables, which resulted in a few small scratches and one ding in the metal ... and then made me a bit more paranoid about leaving the phone unattended on a flat surface.. The OnePlus X is not fully compatible with AT&T. On the OnePlus X and AT&T radio support. OnePlus made a very bad decision, and it means you shouldn't buy the OnePlus X if you use AT&T. The phone is missing LTE Band 17, which is the primary band for AT&T's network — and without it, you really won't get a great network experience.. If you find the OnePlus X dangerously slick (I wouldn't blame you) you can slip it in its included plastic case, which is nice to see in the box. If you want something a bit more stylish you can go to OnePlus and pick up a $15 silicone case or flip cover in a variety of colors, or a $25 hard case in a variety of materials.. Slickness aside, I think OnePlus did a solid job with the design on the X. It clearly gave up some ergonomics in order to execute this nicely symmetrical, clean and understated design, but in a phone of this smaller size the downsides are a bit easier to deal with. It's also great to get this solid of a build on a phone that costs $249, without a millimeter of plastic touching your hand.. OnePlus refreshingly decided to go with a tame screen size on the X, with a 5-inch display that bucks the trend of these less-expensive devices trying to get the largest screen for your money. What it doesn't have in size it makes up for in quality — the 1080p AMOLED panel is actually great, with wonderful colors, crisp resolution, good viewing angles and plenty of brightness. And while the software doesn't offer any fine-tuning of the display like some other phones, I didn't ever feel the need for it — I really like the screen on the OnePlus X.. This is a great screen, and the smaller size will be refreshing for many.. Not only does AMOLED offer punchier colors and better contrast when compared to an LCD, it also lets OnePlus offer a few extra features when combined with good software choices. An "Ambient display" mode lets the screen come on and periodically remind you of your notifications, which simply sips power on an AMOLED display because a full display backlight doesn't need to come on, and OxygenOS also includes a "Dark mode" to flip the primary colors of the interface to black from white, again saving you some power through the course of the day.. I found myself using the default lighter interface because I just prefer the look (and didn't want to give it up to pinch percentages on the battery), but every once and a while I'd choose to flip to the dark mode at night to save my eyes some strain. When you're on the dark mode you can also choose between eight different accent colors for the interface — a nice touch.. The OnePlus X can be used with either one SIM and an SD card, or two SIMs. The Alert Slider works just like the OnePlus 2 — quickly toggle between all/priority/none notifications. You only get 802.11n and 2.4GHz Wifi — no 802.11ac or 5GHz support. The capacitive keys below the screen don't have a backlight. You don't have NFC here, either, which honestly isn't surprising. When you have a phone that's under 7 millimeters thick, there are going to be restrictions — and in this case one of those is the speaker. Though there are two sets of symmetrical holes drilled into the bottom of the OnePlus X on either side of the micro USB port, only the left set work as a speaker. Considering the size of the holes and the tiny space behind them to fit a fully-functioning speaker, it isn't shocking that you don't get room-filling sound out of the X.. I put the speaker right on par with something like the Nexus 5X or Samsung Galaxy S6 — there's enough to get notifications, make speakerphone call and watch YouTube videos, but you won't be doing anything more than that. That means the speaker is doing its job for most people out there, and no matter what phone you have you'll want a speaker or headphones for the best listening experience — I can't knock OnePlus too hard for not having an amazing sound experience in such an inexpensive and compact phone.. Clean, with just the right additions. OnePlus X Software and Performance. OxygenOS is a known quantity at this point, as it's been powering the OnePlus One for some time now and was the launch OS on the OnePlus 2. The base of Android 5.1.1 is augmented and improved upon in just a few areas, leaving most of the rest of the customization to you with the apps you grab from Google Play. OnePlus doesn't mess with a proven formula, and actually uses Google's apps for most of the phone's basic functions. Clock, Calculator, Phone, Contacts and Messenger are all as you'd find on a Nexus, and there aren't any duplicative OnePlus apps or services getting in the way.. OxygenOS is a great take on Lollipop, with just the right amount of change and customization.. The only apps that have been added are a new camera app, file manager, FM radio and the inclusion of SwiftKey as the default keyboard. Even the default launcher is nearly stock-like (though I still tend to go with Google Now Launcher myself), with the single inclusion of the quick app launcher "Shelf," which you can choose to disable. The notification shade is unchanged, aside from being able to customize the quick settings, and the phone's settings menu is a stock-like experience as well.. OxygenOS includes a handful of OS-level customization options, including a dark theme for the entire system with customizable accent colors, the ability to switch between capacitive and on-screen navigation buttons (each of which is also customizable), and app-by-app permission control. It's also a bunch of little things, like being able to choose a few different battery indicators for your status bar, that make OxygenOS really slick and useful.. Compared directly to the Android Lollipop experience you got on a Nexus before the Marshmallow rollout began, OxygenOS compares very nicely. There wasn't a single time I was using the OnePlus X that I was longing to get back to a Nexus experience, nor were there any situations in which I was willing to give up the simplicity of OxygenOS to get more customization and features found on phones from the likes of LG or Samsung .. Speaking of Marshmallow, there is a bit of a hang-up there — at the time of this review being written, OnePlus actually hasn't been able to commit to a time frame for the update to Android 6.0 on the X. We know it's coming for the other two OnePlus phones in Q1 2016 , and for that reason wouldn't expect the X to be far behind, but not knowing always makes the wait a bit tougher.. Of course if you're someone who is dead set on having the latest version of the operating system you're likely to have a Nexus — or perhaps go the custom ROM route — anyway, but if you're content with Lollipop you're getting a great take on that platform with the OnePlus X.. For a phone launching in November 2015 it seemed a bit odd at first that OnePlus went with an older Snapdragon 801 processor — found in the Galaxy S5 , Moto X 2014 and LG G3 (among others) — rather than a newer model like a Snapdragon 808 or perhaps even a Snapdragon 617 to save some money. But at the launch event, OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei laid it out pretty simply — the 801 straight-up outperforms most processors out there today in the new mid-range segment, and because it's a bit on the older side it isn't expensive to use in a phone like the X.. This shouldn't be surprising, but performance is great on the X. When paired up with 3GB of RAM and driving just a 1080p display the Snapdragon 801 performs fantastically, actually, and that shouldn't come as too much of a surprise considering OnePlus has lengthy experience with the chip from its use in the OnePlus One. Of course proper software optimization makes a difference here, and because OxygenOS is quite lightweight there isn't a ton extra for the chip to do — but no matter the reason the X deserves praise for being extremely quick and smooth.. Both basic app usage and heavier 3D games were handled just fine, though the glass back does transfer quite a bit of heat if you've been stuck in an intense game for more than 30 minutes or so. I never saw a single issue starting up apps or switching between them quickly, nor did I have a single app crash or forced reboot in two full weeks using the phone as my primary device.. Get you through an average day. Even though it's powering just a 5-inch display, the 2525 mAh battery inside the OnePlus X is a little on the small side. The Snapdragon 801 hasn't gotten any more efficient since it was released, and the battery inside the OnePlus X is considerably smaller than other phones (18 percent smaller than the OnePlus One) using the same processor.. That translates to just average battery life in the OnePlus X, on the order of "about a full day" in my time using it. With my typical use of keeping up with email, messages, social accounts, podcast listening and browsing, with about two or three hours of screen-on time, the X was good for about 12 to 14 hours of battery life depending on how intense and frequent my usage was. Most days spent primarily on Wifi and not hitting the phone hard were just fine, and I could end my day with double-digit percentage left. But depending on the demands of the day, like when I needed to do lots of navigation, streaming or consistently keeping the screen on for long periods, I'd be reaching for a charger around dinner time. That's a bit shy of the required battery life for some folks out there.. You'll likely get through an average day, but harder use will probably have you charging at dinner time.. When it comes to charging up the OnePlus X you're stuck with a standard 5V/2A charger, as the phone doesn't support any sort of quick charging standard or wireless charging. That doesn't end up being too big of an ordeal considering the battery capacity isn't that high in the first place, but I would've liked to see at least some kind of quick charge support to give it that extra little boost at the start of charging.. Going into reviewing the OnePlus X and looking at the spec sheet I didn't expect much more than what I eventually got out of the battery on this phone. Would I have maybe preferred the body be one or two millimeters thicker and add another 500 mAh? Sure, but it isn't always that easy — and remember that with the overall small size of a phone like this, it's tough to get much in terms of battery in there. Perhaps the phone will be a bit better in the battery department once the power-saving upgrades of Marshmallow hit it — whenever that may be.. Despite talking a big game about the 13MP camera sensor packed into the OnePlus X (a Samsung ISOCELL 3M2, same as the Oppo R7), it's clear that this is one of the places that corners were cut. With a total device thickness of just 6.9 mm there isn't much room for a big camera sensor or elaborate lens array — this one is f/2.2 — and cost restraints likely factored into OIS (optical image stabilization) being dropped from the offering as well. Pair that with a historical lack of camera expertise on the part of OnePlus (not a huge knock — this stuff is hard) and you get a rough experience.. OnePlus just hasn't figured out camera software yet, and the lower-end sensor compounds the issues.. The camera app is about on par with what Google offers in its stock app, which is to say it's quite a bit behind the rest of the manufacturers out there. The basic interface lets you swipe to quickly switch between time-lapse, slow motion, stills, video (720 or 1080p) and panoramas, and when you're in either photo or video mode you can tap a menu button to access quick settings. Beyond that, you don't get much in the settings — just a few toggles to save location, turn off shutter sounds and show a grid in the viewfinder. I'm a fan of simple camera apps so long as the pictures they output are good, but as I'll get to below, they get a bit more frustrating when the end product isn't there.. HDR should help in compromising light conditions, but this one doesn't work at all.. When it comes to shooting stills, you don't have a ton of tools at your disposal — just tapping to focus, tapping and holding to lock focus and then adjust brightness, 20 frame burst mode (just hold the shutter down), and then three toggles to turn on Clear Image, HDR or Beauty modes. The X is actually really fast to open, focus and take pictures, but the results are just average in quality, and suffer quickly in low light situations down to the point of being pretty poor at night. Pictures can get grainy in all but perfect lighting, which is really a step below what we expect of cameras nowadays.. HDR and Clear Image modes are both supposed to help in these tougher lighting situations, but unfortunately that isn't the case here. Despite being very quick to take single shots, the OnePlus X struggles to quickly capture multiple exposures for these shooting modes, leading to blurry shots no matter how steady you hold your hands — you'd literally need a tripod for the phone in order to take clear HDR shots. After several days trying to get HDR to do anything of use for me, I ended up just sticking with the automatic mode, which consistently offered better results despite the sensor's shortcomings in low light.. Putting it all into the perspective of a $249 phone you can't be too upset with the image quality here, and I was able to take plenty of solid pictures with the OnePlus X during my testing of it. It's just really upsetting to feel hamstrung by the lack of a capable HDR mode, which if done well can help bail out an otherwise low-quality sensor. OnePlus has yet to show me that it can make a great camera app with good processing, and things do have lots of room to improve — whether or not they actually do has yet to be seen.. On the front of the phone is a run-of-the-mill 8MP camera with an f/2.4 lens. It's basic, and the software interface is unchanged when you switch it up to the front-facing shooter. The results look like every other mid-range phone, just at a bit higher resolution on account of having eight megapixels to work with.. A nice value option with some shortcomings. Should you buy the OnePlus X? Sign up for an invite. OnePlus executed a great plan with the X, making an inexpensive phone that in no way feels or performs like the price tag would lead you to believe. The experience of having the OnePlus X in your hand and using it on a daily basis is top notch, no matter the price class. Money was clearly spent in the right places, offering great external hardware, high-end essential components on the inside, and an awesome screen. That's backed up by a really slick software experience that takes stock Android and adds in a handful of really useful customizations without bringing bloat or useless features.. Of course that means corners had to be cut somewhere to meet the $249 price, and the OnePlus X doesn't come with all of the bells and whistles that other phones do. There's no quick charging available, no NFC, no advanced Wifi support, a weak speaker, just average battery life, and unfortunately a subpar camera experience. And of course as I noted earlier, there are real concerns about using the OnePlus X on AT&T here in the U.S.. With all of those downsides in mind, I still think the OnePlus X averages out to be a good value for the money, and in this price bracket there are bound to be trade offs that make you think about which ones you can live with.. If you're in need (or want) of a compact, inexpensive device that offers a great hardware experience and day-to-day usage, and you place those features on a higher level than the ancillary things on the fringes of your use, the OnePlus X is a good one to go with. OnePlus has just opened up invites for the X, which will last until the end of December, so if you're interested in one you should go get yourself in line.. You don't have to commit to buy when you sign up, so I'm going to recommend you do so, and while you wait the handful of days (or a couple weeks) for the invite to come in you can decide if the OnePlus X is right for you. Even without all of the extra features and spec sheet line items that phone manufacturers usually try to sell their devices on, the X offers a great value at $249.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL.

Hi friends Please don’t buy the One Plus products the very very worst service that I ever gone through, I bought the One Plus X phone on 22nd Feb 2016 through Amazon, after the 12th day the problem was started, the phone automatically gone to no interruption mode (can’t hear the Ringing or Message tone) and I was tried to resolve it but I can’t then I call the One Plus Customer care for help and I was followed their instructions but again the problem was not resolved and they told me to give their Authorized service centre. The next day I went to the One Plus X authorized service centre Guindy, Chennai, and from there I got the shock and they told me that the problem in the mother board then I call immediately to the Amazon customer care for replacement but unfortunately the return policy within 10 days only. again I call the One Plus Customer Care Service and they told me to give the phone to service since it’s in the warranty period, as per the instruction I hardened over the phone to their authorised service centre for the service of my New Mobile Phone and till date the problem is not been resolved, whenever I call the One Plus Customer care the only answer I will get by end of the day the service engineer will call You, but till date I am not getting the call back from One Plus support and mobile still in the service centre only now it more than 21 days I am running behind this people but no result.. PLEASE DON’T BUY THE ONE PLUS PRODUCTS. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 2 out of 2 people found this review helpful. oneplus x is the right choice.... By Kamlesh Kumar | 8 Feb 2017. Was this review helpful? Yes No. By Abhi Singh | 22 Feb 2016. A good looking (Budget) smartphone with top notch design and uncompromised performance (except for battery life which lasts for only a day with two SIMs+3G connectivity). The back is glass and gives it a premium feel with 5 inch screen which makes it very practical for 2 wheeler users. Because of the size, one can easily park it in the pocket (shirt or trouser) and drive the vehicle. Was this review helpful? Yes No. By Chandran Kr | 29 Jan 2016. Full marks for its looks, excellent build quality and smooth operation (OS). It is more than double the value for money you pay. Right from the factory fitted scratch proof to the tap gesture controls to the slim translucent cover packed in with the mobile. I wish it was shipped with earphones shipped along with it. The only cons are low light photography is not good but that is how low light photography is - realistic. I lost the charger adapter (not the charger cable), but i am so enamored by the Oneplus brand that I finally, I searched and got an original adapter for double the price of other adapters. I do not want to buy a Samsung adapter that is compatible for Oneplus X. Do I have to say more then? Pros, superb display, you would not want a better display than this because your eyes cant see the difference, viewing angles superb, it is crystal clear. I do not agree with NDTV bad point 'Questionable build quality'. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 1 out of 2 people found this review helpful.

The unlocked OnePlus X is a premium Android phone for an affordable price, but missing North American LTE bands and a frustrating invite-only setup makes it hard to recommend for U.S. Unlike the OnePlus One and the. OnePlus 2 , the new OnePlus X ($249; 16GB) isn't being advertised as a "flagship killer." Instead, it is aimed at shaking up the budget market. phone doesn't make any major hardware compromises —and it's easy to use one-handed. That makes it a rare commodity these days, but thanks to a pesky invite-only purchase system and the lack of key North American bands, the OnePlus X is difficult to recommend over rival unlocked phones like the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 4.7 and the. Motorola Moto X Pure Edition (Unlocked). Droid Maxx 2 by Motorola (Verizon Wireless). Design, Display, and Features The OnePlus X. It's essentially two slabs of glass. held in place by a metal frame, similar in design to the classic Apple iPhone 4. 5.51 by 2.72 by 0.27 inches (HWD) and weighs 4.86 ounces, making it easy to hold and use with just one hand.. The Nexus 5X (5.79 by 2.86 by 0.31 inches, 4.8 ounces) is notably while the Idol 3 (5.40 by 2.59 by 0.30 inches, 3.88 ounces) is slightly smaller, but not nearly as sleek.. The glass back has a habit of picking up smudges, and feels a bit slippery in your hand,. so you'll probably want to consider getting a case.. View All 8 Photos in Gallery. The front of the phone is home to a 5-inch AMOLED display. It packs 441 pixels per inch into its 16:9 frame, matching the native resolution of 1080p video. Everything looks crisp and bright, with rich colors and good viewing angles, even outdoors. This is an excellent screen for the price.. Three capacitive touch buttons sit below the display,. and a bit hard to see. You have the option of switching to on-screen buttons, but I found that it wasn't worth the loss of screen real estate. a clicky metal power button and a volume rocker on the right, and an alert slider on the left, all of which are easy to reach. The alert slider is a welcome feature introduced on the OnePlus 2; it toggles between All Notifications, Priority Interruptions, and No Interruptions without having to unlock your phone.. Notable features missing on the OnePlus X include a fingerprint scanner and fast charging, both of which are. present on the OnePlus 2 and can be found on the Nexus 5X. Then again, you're paying a lot less for the OnePlus X, and neither of these features indispensable.. Network Performance and Sound The OnePlus X supports GSM (850/900/1800/1900MHz), WCDMA (1/2/4/5/8), and LTE (1/2/4/5/7/8) bands. There is no CDMA, so you can't use the phone on Sprint or Verizon. Even on AT&T and T-Mobile, however, your performance might be affected by the lack of some key bands.. There is no Band 12 support for T-Mobile, which will reduce connectivity outside of cities. I tested the OnePlus X on T-Mobile's network in midtown Manhattan and found it to be acceptably fast. But that's well inside city limits, and the lack of Band 12 isn't a problem in that area.. Testing the OnePlus X on AT&T was a different story. Here, the device is missing Band 17,. stuck on HSPA+ most of the time I was inside, but even when I was able to connect to LTE outdoors speeds weren't particularly impressive — the highest download speed I clocked was 8.76Mbps.. , on the other hand, are just fine. both on both AT&T and T-Mobile. Wi-Fi is limited to 2.4GHz 802.11b/g/n. Bluetooth 4.0 is included, along with a proximity sensor, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and an ambient light sensor. There's no NFC, but that's not a surprise considering it's also absent on the higher-end OnePlus 2.. Ultimately, I get the sense that the OnePlus X was never truly targeted for the U.S. market, where the phablet reigns supreme. The big sales are probably going to happen in China, India, and other emerging markets.. Processor and Battery From a hardware perspective, the OnePlus X is. essentially a repackaged version of the OnePlus One. There's a Snapdragon 801 processor, 3GB of RAM, and 16GB of internal storage. The OnePlus X can accommodate dual SIM cards, or a single SIM and a microSD card up to 128GB. card during though it did recognize that a card had been inserted.. In terms of general usage and multitasking, the Snapdragon 801 continues to hold up well, despite its age. App switching and app launching were both speedy in my tests. The only time the hardware started to show its age was when playing games. I noticed the occasional frame drop, suggesting that the Adreno 330 GPU was struggling at certain points. The OnePlus X got an AnTuTu score of 39,787, which is significantly lower than the Snapdragon 808-powered Nexus 5X (51,880).. Battery life is good, though not great. With its 2,525mAh battery, the OnePlus X clocked 5 hours, 45 minutes in our rundown test where we set screen brightness to max and stream full-screen video over LTE. That's a little better than the OneTouch Idol 3 (5 hours, 14 minutes), but almost an hour. less than the Nexus 5X (6 hours, 32 minutes).. Camera The OnePlus X takes crisp, clear shots with its 13-megapixel rear camera, with excellent detail. Autofocus and autoexposure are both reliable, and the device can shoot just as quickly as the Nexus 5X. The OnePlus X also has burst mode, which is something the 5X lacks.. Using both phones side by side, the only notable difference between the two is white balance. The OnePlus X captures warmer, slightly more saturated colors. than necessarily accurate when compared with the Nexus 5X. Low-light performance isn't as strong here, with. The OnePlus X is capable of 1080p video capture at 30 frames per second (fps) and 720p slow-mo video at 120fps. Despite the lack of optical image stabilization (OIS), video recording is free from jerkiness or jittering. The 8-megapixel selfie camera is solid.. See How We Test Cell Phones. Software, Availability, and Conclusions The OnePlus X runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, with OxygenOS 2.1.2 running on top. Despite being a custom UI, the only pre-installed app is SwiftKey. Aside from that, OxygenOS is mostly stock Android, with some extra features.. There are gesture controls like double-tap-to-wake, or drawing a circle on the screen to launch the camera. You can also customize the capacitive buttons to carry out similar functions. If you swipe left from the home screen, there's a page that shows your most frequently used apps and contacts. the additions are genuinely useful, and most Android fans will be pleased.. The OnePlus X sounds like a pretty great phone, right? So why the relatively average score? Well, it's hard to be overly enthusiastic about a device you might not ever be able to get.. is available through an invite-only purchase system. OnePlus says that it will only be for the first month, but even after that, the phone won't be readily available outside of weekly flash sales. botched the release of the OnePlus 2 badly enough to issue an apology, I don't have much faith in the invite system. I understand that the company wants to avoid having tons of stock tied up in warehouses, but understanding this doesn't do anything for me when I want to buy a phone right now.. OnePlus X is a solid phone for an excellent price. It's easily the best-looking phone you can get for though it falls short of some other unlocked options and misses some LTE bands.. The Nexus 5X is more expensive, but it's also more powerful and offers better connectivity options for U.S. The OneTouch Idol 3 4.7, meanwhile, offers largely comparable hardware for. And both devices are much easier to get than the OnePlus X, which could prove to be the deciding factor for many potential buyers.. Bottom Line: The unlocked OnePlus X is a premium Android phone for an affordable price, but missing North American LTE bands and a frustrating invite-only setup makes it hard to recommend for U.S. Ajay Kumar is PCMag's Analyst obsessed with all things mobile.

OnePlus X: Is the OnePlus 3 worth the extra dough?. OnePlus finally unveiled the OnePlus 3, a solid flagship smartphone that’s affordable and powerful. If you’ve been following OnePlus, however, you’ll know that it also recently released an even more affordable phone — the OnePlus X. The latter represents the company’s first midrange phone with midrange specs, and while the X isn’t a flagship, it’s still a great device. But how does it compare with the OnePlus 3? Below, we’ve pitted the two phones against one another, so you can see for yourself.. 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.4mm (6.01 x 2.94 x 0.29-inches). 140 x 69 x 6.9mm (5.51 x 2.72 x 0.27-inches). Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow w/ Oxygen OS. We’re not trying to see which phone is better here — it’s obvious that the OnePlus 3 is. Just how much better, however, is up for debate. The OnePlus 3 makes use of Qualcomm’s flagship processor, the Snapdragon 820. This is a chip that should be able to handle everything you have to throw at it for at least the next few years. The Snapdragon 801 found in the X doesn’t have as much longevity. bad processor, it’s certainly not the most capable one on the market.. Basically, if you expect to game, edit media, or do anything else that may require a heavy-duty processor, you’re going to want the OnePlus 3. For those simply looking to browse social media and handle emails, however, the OnePlus X is more than capable. There’s just one huge problem with the OnePlus X: If you live in the U.S., you can’t use it. The onePlus 3, however, is fully functional in the States.. When it comes to RAM, which will also impact the performance of your device, the OnePlus 3 once again is a high performer. In fact, it’s a speed demon, one that boasts. a whopping 6GB of RAM compared to the OnePlus X’s 3GB. It’s important to note that the OnePlus 3 is one of only a few devices to offer 6GB of RAM, however, as 3GB remains the standard. Still, if you’re looking for a performance beast, look no further than the OnePlus 3.. Storage capacity also sets the two phones apart. While the OnePlus 3 offers a hefty 64GB of space, the X takes things down a notch, sitting at 16GB. Still, the X offers something that the 3 does not — a MicroSD card slot. OnePlus has never been one to use MicroSD card slots in its flagship phones, but it’s clear that it wanted to reduce cost as much as possible for the X and realized that 16GB simply might not be enough for many users.. Battery life is likely to be a little better on the OnePlus 3 than the X, though, as it has a larger battery capacity and. the same display, which is what consumes most of the battery.. Smartphone companies, led by Apple, have long used the art of minimalism to create beautiful phones. So much so that, these days, we often look for a simpler phone because. In the case of the OnePlus 3 and X, the X looks far more basic than the 3. It has a sleek backing with a logo in the middle, along with a camera in. Moreover, it’s thinner than the 3. It’s expected that the device would be shorter and less wide than the OnePlus 3 because of the smaller screen size, but it’s nice that it’s thinner too.. Of course, that’s not to say that the OnePlus 3 isn’t a great-looking device. It’s sleek and stylish, and also very minimalistic. It seems to take design cues from Apple and HTC, but it looks great. The all-metal build is sturdy and polished, making it look like a true flagship phone.. The OnePlus 3 is only available in “Graphite,” while the X comes in either Onyx, Ceramic, or Champagne. However, you can get special wooden, leather, and other slim cases for the OnePlus 3 to jazz it up a bit.. The display on the two OnePlus devices isn’t exactly a point of contention, either. the same resolution, though the display on the OnePlus 3 is slightly larger at 5.5 inches.. What that means is that the display on the OnePlus X is slightly more crisp than that on the OnePlus 3, which comes in at 5 inches.. size, however, there’s really no difference — both have AMOLED displays with 1,080 x 1,920-pixel resolution.. The camera is perhaps one of the biggest differences between the two devices. The camera on the OnePlus 3 has a 16-megapixel sensor with an f/2.0 aperture, phase detection autofocus, optical image stabilization, and an LED flash. By comparison, the OnePlus X has a 13-megapixel sensor and an f/2.2 aperture, which means images won’t be as large and the camera won’t function as well in low-light situations. It has the same phase detection autofocus and LED flash as the OnePlus 3, however it does not have the optical image stabilization.. On top of that, the OnePlus 3 also has support for RAW photos and the ability to capture 4K video. The OnePlus X can only capture 1,080p.. In other words, while the OnePlus X camera will be decent, it won’t stand up against the OnePlus 3. The latter simply has better camera specs.. There’s not too much to discuss here, as your. software experiences on both devices will be roughly the same. The OnePlus X ships with Android 5.1, however its updatable to Android 6.0, which is what ships on the OnePlus 3. Both devices feature OnePlus’ Oxygen OS Android overlay, but it’s close to stock Android and it doesn’t have much bloatware and extra services.. While both the OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus X are from the same company, they’re very different phones. In fact, they were intended to be so. The OnePlus X is a midrange phone, not a flagship like the 3. On top of that, it’s a midrange phone from last year. The OnePlus 3 is a phone for the tech geek — if you need a powerful smartphone that will. last you for the next few years, the OnePlus 3 is the device for you. It also boasts top-of-the-line specs at an affordable price. The OnePlus X, however, is a great choice for those who need to make calls, text, browse social media, and perform other simple tasks — assuming you live in Europe or outside of the States.. Overall, the OnePlus 3 is the winner here. For $400, you get an amazing flagship phone with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a Samsung Galaxy S7 or LG G5.. Here are the best OnePlus 5T cases to keep the flagship-killer beautiful. Will OnePlus release a new OnePlus X model after the OnePlus 6?.

Not quite two years ago, the OnePlus One redefined the level of quality one can expect from a budget smartphone, a $300 device that compared (sometimes favorably) to flagships twice its price. It also redefined frustration with an arcane, invite-based ordering system. The new OnePlus X pushes that value proposition even farther. The invites are back, too—but for a good reason.. First, the phone, a $250 device with the look and specs of if not an iPhone or Galaxy S device, something on the very next rung. It's got 3GB of RAM, a 5-inch, 1080p AMOLED display, and a 13MP rear-facing camera. On balance, that's roughly comparable to Google's shiny, new, $380 Nexus 5X, itself an aggressive value play. From there, you settle for a ho-hum Snapdragon 801 processor and 16GB of storage, somewhat balanced out by expandable microSD storage, a near-extinct smartphone feature in 2015. It also runs OxygenOS, an operating that looks and feels like Google's version of Android (it even uses Google apps) but is built by OnePlus from the ground up, which isn't so much good or bad but interesting.. All of this would make the OnePlus X a steal, even if it were housed in a plastic brick body. The OnePlus X is a looker. Its build quality looks like it could have come straight out of Cupertino, though not in an imitative way. It has a glass backplate, for heaven's sake.. "If you look at the specs, they are still pretty powerful specs," says OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei. "But we have come to a time where incremental increase in clock speed doesn't add to the user experience as much as a better camera, or much better build quality, or better design does.". It's clear that OnePlus has focused its efforts on the latter. There's even an extremely limited-edition ceramic version of the OnePlus X that's literally "fire-baked" at 2,700 degrees, for 28 hours, as part of the manufacturing process. It sounds like something you'd find from a gaudy ultra-lux shop like Vertu. It costs just a little over $400.. "This is a very big step for us as a company," explains Pei. "We are trying to reach a broader audience. Maybe not the mass market, but maybe people who care more about the design of a project" than the early adopter crowd that gave OnePlus its early success.. Now the bad news: While the OnePlus X will be more available than the OnePlus One and OnePlus Two were at their respective launches, it's still not going to be easy to get one. A broader audience, after all, means fewer devices to go around.. Still, some OnePlus adjustments should make invite acquisition slightly less labyrinthine. Besides which, it turns out there's a very good chance that you'd miss them if they were gone.. Here's how the OnePlus X invite process works: For the first month that the phone is available, you can sign up to be placed on a reservation list. From that list, a select number of people will be offered an invitation to purchase the phone. The initial run of invites comprises 5,000 apiece for the U.S., Europe, and India (Apple sold 13 million iPhone 6s and 6s Plus units in just the first three days of sales).. So far, so simple, even if the numbers are a bit daunting. From there, it becomes much less so. The reservation list isn't the only way to get an invite; you can also get one through OnePlus social media promotions, or at one of a few pop-up shops. After the first month, invites will be available once a week on a first-come, first serve basis. That window will always be the same day of the week, but could start at different times on that day. They'll initially be an hour long, but could expand based on, well, who knows? Also: People who do buy a phone can pass an invite along to a friend.. Oh, and the OnePlus X won't be available in the U.S. Europe and India go live on November 5.. Eventually, the company has said, the OnePlus will be available invite-free. Until then, though, you'll probably have better luck catching fireflies with a slotted spoon. That's a key trade-off, though, to having something so good come so cheap.. "We know that the invite system limits the speed of our growth, but it also gives us more security in how we run our business," explains Pei. "We might be trading off some short-term growth opportunities in exchange for a more long-term, more healthy business.". The invite system isn't ideal but the two alternatives, as Pei sees them, are even worse. He could produce enough phones to cover his most ambitious sales estimates, and risk being stuck with a major write-down—remember, Amazon got stuck with a $170 million Fire Phone bill just last year. Or he could charge a lot more to help mitigate any potential losses, but get lost in the ever-expanding sea of perfectly adequate, $400 Android handsets.. Instead, OnePlus is pursuing a strategy that it knows isn't perfect, but beats becoming anonymous—or worse.. "If you look at other smartphone makers, and hardware and consumer electronics companies, inventory has been a much bigger pain than a lack of sales," Pei notes. "More companies go bankrupt because they keep too much stock, versus companies who can't sell enough.". It's better, in other words, to have a delayed OnePlus X than risk having no OnePlus X at all.. Pei remains open to other sales strategies, and says the company has learned a lot since the rocky launches of the OnePlus One and OnePlus Two. He also knows they haven't figured it out quite yet, and that the stakes to do so are higher than ever.. "Over the last two years, we grew much faster than we thought we would," says Pei. "Now there's a lot of people who want to buy our phones, but they're becoming more and more frustrated by how hard the phones are to get … It's too difficult of a process.". Part of the solution is availability, and part of it is process. The larger volume of invites should help with the former. As for the latter, despite its gloss the OnePlus X uses more off-the-shelf components than its predecessors did, meaning it should be easier to ramp up when needed.. We're still pretty far from the day buying a OnePlus X is as simple as offering the company your money and receiving a good in exchange. To pass the time until then—or until you score an invite—just remember that the OnePlus X is absolutely a bargain.

Trending iPhone X Nintendo Switch OnePlus 5T Tesla Model 3 Xbox One X. OnePlus X REVIEW: I can’t believe a phone this good is so cheap. by Brandon Russell | November 20, 2015. The wealthiest team in sports doesn’t always win the championship. Sometimes all you need are the right pieces, the willingness to take risks, and if you’re lucky, you’ll get your reward. Nobody would have predicted a team like Leicester City, which finished 14th last campaign, to be among the top teams in the English Premier League this season. Yet The Foxes are right near the top.. That analogy very much parallels the mobile market, which is quickly becoming a more diverse and accessible place full of strong competition. Companies such as Apple and Samsung gained an early advantage because they had the riches to create some of the most desirable smartphones we’ve ever seen. But just because a phone is powerful and expensive doesn’t mean it’s the best. For how good the Galaxy S6 Edge Plus is, you can get an equally good experience with a phone like the Nexus 5X. And the options don’t end there.. To get the best, you used to have to pay the price. But over the past year, it. become clear that buying a cheap phone no longer means it’s also bad. In fact, there’s an All-Star team of affordable standouts available right now, ranging from the unbelievably impressive $129 Moto G, to the solid $399 Moto X Pure Edition. These are handsets you can proudly buy without feeling like you’re missing out, and you don’t have to break the bank to get them.. Now we can add the OnePlus X to that list, which, at just $250 off-contract, offers some of the best value we’ve seen all year. A good phone needs to have peppy performance, a solid camera, and a beautiful design. What a phone no longer needs is a monster price tag, and the OnePlus X is yet another perfect example.. Cheap phones often feel cheaply made, something we accept without a fuss because you get what you pay for. But the OnePlus X is in a completely different class, combining an elegance and polish usually reserved for the top rung of smartphones. If you handed this to your buddy, they’d have a hard time believing this was just $250. Even I’m still having a hard time.. Surrounded by an intricately etched metal frame with chamfered edges, the OnePlus X looks and feels like an expensive piece of jewelry; it sparkles in the light with the sophistication of something you’d find behind a heavily guarded display. When sitting next to an iPhone or Galaxy device, some of the most highly regarded designs on the market, it doesn’t look out of place. The build quality is that superb.. That said, the OnePlus X’s design does borrow ideas, and winds up looking like a cross between an iPhone/Nexus 4/Xperia, which is absolutely fine in my book. Phones look like other phones, that’s just the way it is. The sooner we get past that the sooner we can start appreciating the kind of craftsmanship and engineering that goes into these objects of our desire. The OnePlus X looks like other phones, but it’s beautiful nonetheless.. One small way it does put its own stamp on the design is through that excellent Alert Slider; it’s a small addition, but it makes for a big difference throughout the day. Just slide it up and you’ll get no interruptions. Keep it in the middle and only priority notifications will come streaming through.. Other than that, the problems we’ve had with double-sided glass phones still persist; namely, the OnePlus X is a bit of a fingerprint magnet, and you just know it’s begging to be shattered into a million pieces the second it’s dropped. Not a monumental deal, but worth noting.. Oh, and OnePlus has decided to also offer a Ceramic version of the X, but only 10,000 are being made due to the complexity of the manufacturing process, which involves heating raw zirconia for 28 hours, and takes 25 days in total from start to finish. It’ll cost more at around $400, but if you want something relatively unique, that might be something to consider.. But not even the gorgeous design can hide the fact that the OnePlus X is running older specs. We’re on the cusp of getting our hands on the Snapdragon 820, so if you’re absolutely intent on being on the cutting edge, the OnePlus x’s Snapdragon 801 probably won’t do it for you, especially if you’re looking for something that’s future proof. That said, you have to remember this is the same processor used in the OnePlus One, which offered excellent performance.. From my experience, the X was more or less what you’d expect: it certainly doesn’t feel low-end, though it’s not exactly the pick of the litter, either. You won’t really notice it’s running older specs unless you’ve experienced the power of a Note 5. The X isn’t meant to singe your hair with speed; it zips from place to place at an acceptable rate, and only occasionally will it show it’s not the fastest around. For the price, however, you still get 3GB of RAM, a 5-inch, 1080p AMOLED display, a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera, 16GB of expandable storage, OxygenOS based on Android 5.1.1, and a 2525mAh battery, which is a lot smaller than the 3100mAh unit used in the OnePlus One from last year. That’s one area where OnePlus made a significant compromise in its pursuit for such a thin (6.9mm) design.. Luckily OnePlus’ OxygenOS does a pretty stellar job optimizing performance and keeping the X alive through a heavy day of use. I’m talking Twitter, gaming, Facebook, Instagram and the other usual suspects. My expectations weren’t particularly high since the battery is relatively small compared to some of today’s big flagships, but I was actually surprised at how well the device held up.. OnePlus has already baked battery-saving features into its software, which means users are getting some of the benefits of Google’s Marshmallow, albeit in OnePlus’ own way. A Marshmallow build is eventually coming to the X, but the current iteration of OxygenOS more than holds its own, offering the same fun tweaks and little flourishes we came to love when we reviewed the OnePlus 2 a few months back .. Even though the battery is decent, the OnePlus X doesn’t offer the luxuries of wireless charging or Quick Charge, the latter of which is hard to live without once you use it. Some of today’s most popular flagships can be topped off in just minutes; you won’t get such extravagance with the OnePlus X. Such is the life of a $250 phone.. The X’s AMOLED display might be a boon to the battery as well; OnePlus takes advantage of the screen by making a lot of OxygenOS’s UI black, keeping pixels turned off when they’re not needed; it’s a thoughtful way to ensure the battery isn’t taking a hit while you’re swiping through your app draw or digging through settings.. The display, which comfortably curves ever-so-slightly at the edges, is quite nice, too; it’s sharp, colorful, and stands up well in bright light. It also doesn’t completely blind your face before bed, which is another benefit of AMOLED. For such an affordable phone, this is a top display—you won’t have any complaints. And at 5 inches, it’s smaller than screens used in both the OnePlus One and OnePlus 2, which I quite like. The X’s overall footprint winds up being the perfect size.. Not everything is dandy at such a low price, however, and there are some inevitable compromises. One of my major gripes is the lack of a fingerprint sensor, which is becoming very common among today’s top phones,. including the Nexus 6P, iPhone 6s, Galaxy S6 Edge Plus; we’ve also seen the technology spread into the mid-range market as well with phones like the OnePlus 2, Nexus 5X, and HTC A9. While the lack of a fingerprint sensor is by no means a deal breaker, it’s sorely missed.. Meanwhile, the OnePlus X lacks a few important bands for low-frequency LTE here in the U.S., which means you might experience an unreliable LTE connection depending on where you live. I was able to get a consistent HSPA+ connection through AT&T at my apartment in Huntington Beach, CA, which pulled down decent speeds. When the phone did connect to LTE, I. was never on it for more than a few minutes.. These are pretty minor compromises in the grand scheme of things, but worth noting if you plan on keeping this phone for the next few years. The device also doesn’t come with NFC just like the OnePlus 2, which has been a very controversial decision to say the least. I never find myself in situations where I need NFC (I don’t use mobile payments), but it’s technology people use for sure. It’s an especially egregious omission now that Android Pay is available.. The OnePlus X sports a 13-megapixel sensor with ISOCELL technology, which is capable of isolating individual pixels inside the sensor. What this does is improve the sensor’s ability to capture light, and also reduce crosstalk. Compared to a BSI sensor, crosstalk promises to offer. In reality, the X’s camera isn’t the strongest performer out there. You’ll get adequate images—good enough to share with friends and to post on social media. But there’s a lot of processing going on here, and I often got pictures. that were noticeably noisy, soft and bland, especially in lower light situations. And you can pretty much forget about cropping in on images.. improve as OnePlus optimizes how the software processes pictures, but, as it stands, the X’s camera is, at best, just OK. I never expected this to match the quality of the Nexus 6P or iPhone 6s Plus, but it will have to do.. The actual stock camera app built inside of Oxygen OS is very easy to use: Tap on an area and the camera will focus; tap the shutter button and you’ve made a photo. Focusing is very quick and painless, too, and always seemed to accurately pinpoint the subject I was aiming at. Taking pictures was pretty snappy as well; never was there a situation where the camera’s sluggishness kept me from taking the photo I wanted.. Thanks to OxygenOS’s customization features, I was able to set the camera to launch by pressing the X’s middle capacitive button (capacitive buttons that don’t light up, which is another slight annoyance; you can always just go with onscreen buttons if you prefer). It doesn’t launch quite as quick as Samsung’s implementation in the Note 5 or S6 Edge Plus, but the X’s camera was always ready to go when I needed it.. Some of the features inside of the camera app are pretty standard. You get options like slow motion, photo, video, time lapse, and panorama. You also have access to functions like HDR, a beauty feature, and clear image, which OnePlus introduced last year. Clear image essentially combines 10 individual photos for one final super high-res image. That’s not something you might use regularly, but it could be great for trips to Yosemite.. The OnePlus X offers a great balance of performance, design, and price. With a few small revisions, it could have been one of this year’s top phones.. Offering cheap phones is the name of the game for OnePlus, and even though this isn’t the company’s most powerful device, it might be its most important. Nearly two years ago, the Chinese startup surprised the market with a phone. that offered high-end specs for an amazing price. The OnePlus X follows a similar path, and does so for just $250.. At that price, it’s hard to focus on the X’s shortcomings. The phone is by no means perfect, but it’s among. the best value propositions on the market. That is, if you can even get your hands on the X, which (ugh), can only be purchased through an invite system. That just comes with the OnePlus territory I’m afraid.. The fact that it doesn’t support important cellular bands here in the U.S. is a deal breaker for some, and it doesn’t come with NFC, which is yet another controversial decision on OnePlus’ part.. I’d be very curious to see what next year’s. With a few more revisions, this could. very well become the company’s strongest device, even if it doesn’t come with the very latest specs.. If you’re on a very strict budget, I’d highly recommend this phone with the caveat that you might not get a consistent LTE connection.. But at $250, it’s hard to ignore just how good of a phone this is despite its imperfections.. Brandon used the OnePlus X for five days before beginning his review.

OnePlus 2: Which invite-only phone should you buy?. OnePlus recently announced the classy and elegant younger sibling of the OnePlus 2, the OnePlus X. This new smartphone will start rolling out on November 24 to those who have secured early invites, allowing early adopters to quickly capitalize on the company’s penchant for design and competitive pricing.. However, looks and affordability aren’t everything. The forthcoming device also sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor. and 5-inch AMOLED, along with 13-megapixel rear camera and. 16GB of internal memory suited for all your storage needs (photos, music, etc.).. There are some notable differences between the OnePlus X and the like-minded OnePlus 2, though.. detailed outline of the specifications powering both devices, as well as detailed analysis of how. compare when it comes to design, power, camera quality, pricing, and availability. 140 x 69 x 6.9 mm (5.51 x 2.72 x 0.27 in). 151.8 x 74.9 x 9.9 mm (5.98 x 2.95 x 0.39 in). 138 g / 160 g (4.87 oz). 1080 x 1920 Pixels, 401 ppi. 1080 x 1920 Pixels, 401 ppi. Yes, expandable up to 128 GB. Quad-core 2.3 GHz CPU, and Adreno 330 GPU. Quad-core 1.56 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 1.82 GHz Cortex-A57 CPUs, Adreno 430 GPU. Rear 13 MP, front 5 MP. Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, fingerprint sensor, GPS. The OnePlus X and OnePlus 2 are two attractive smartphones. They both feature sleek black designs that lack any sort of logos or branding on the front, along with. button lights that fade and provide a subtle look when the phone is off. Both devices feature aluminum casing and utilize Gorilla Glass, though, the OnePlus X uses Gorilla Glass 3. the OnePlus 2 opts for Gorilla Glass 4. an intuitive “notification slider ” — which. allows you to control the amount and type. of notifications you receive without having to silence the phone or fiddle with menus — and a 1080p display.. The aforementioned similarities aside, there are a few differences that play into the form factor and look of. The OnePlus X’s front glass screen is beveled and the back is made of either onyx glass or baked ziroconia ceramic — the latter of which. will only be available in Europe and India for now. It also opts for a 5-inch display opposed to the 5.5-inch screen adorning the. The backing material on the OnePlus 2 can be customized to suit your preferred look and feel, though, whether you prefer a matte black, black marble, or wood-grain finish. if commitment makes you nervous, you’ll be happy to know that you can swap the backing. The OnePlus 2 is also a larger phone than the OnePlus X, but only slightly.. Overall, the OnePlus X is smaller and lacks customization options. It also comes outfitted with an. older version of Gorilla Glass despite being the newer phone. Such being the case, the OnePlus 2 beats out the OnePlus X ever so slightly when it comes to numbers, even if they are essentially equal in terms of aesthetic appeal. If design is your main concern, either option would be a good choice, and the two designs will appeal to different types of people.. The OnePlus X might be the newer phone, but its hardware is a step behind that of its sibling. a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset, which houses a quad-core 2.3GHz processor and an Adreno 330 GPU. The Snapdragon 810 chipset and the Quad-core 1.82 GHz Cortex-A57 processors on the OnePlus 2 outshine the hardware on the OnePlus X, especially when combined with the. What’s this mean? To put it simply, the OnePlus 2 should showcase. better processing speed all around, as well as better capacity for graphically intensive apps and mobile games. Regardless, the OnePlus X’s 801 is nothing to sniff at — it’s still a decent processor.. However, the two phones are bit more comparable in regards to their internal storage and RAM capacities. The OnePlus X offers a solid 3GB RAM — slightly higher than average when compared to other smartphones — though it only comes with 16GB of internal storage. It’s possible to bump this up to 128GB with a MicroSD card, but it comes at the price of one of the devices dual-SIM slots. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 2 offers either 3 or 4GB of RAM, and either 16 or 64GB storage, depending on the model.. At the base model, the OnePlus 2 is about the same as the OnePlus X, but the higher capacity OnePlus 2 model overtakes the X. This also proves to be the case when comparing their batteries — the 3,300mAh battery in the OnePlus 2 will last you longer than the 2,525mAh battery in the OnePlus X.. OnePlus X isn’t trying to be the fastest or most powerful phone out there, but rather one of the more affordable options on the market.. In that regard, the OnePlus X’s hardware should please consumers working with a. However, in this particular case, the advantage goes to the OnePlus 2.. Camera functionality and quality is a different story. The primary cameras for both phones rock an appreciable 13. camera, which is not the highest megapixel rating. on the market, but certainly a worthy number. However, they differ somewhat when it comes to video. The OnePlus X can capture your scenes at either 1080p and 30fps, or 720p and 120fps. The OnePlus 2 will record at either 2160p and 30 fps, or 720p and 120fps. They’re similar, but the OnePlus 2 will be sharper.. Image captured with the OnePlus X.. Now on to the secondary camera. Here, the numbers favor the OnePlus X, whose secondary camera rates higher at 8 megapixels, versus the OnePlus 2’s 5 megapixels. It’s worth noting that megapixels aren’t the sole factor affecting image quality, but it helps, and your selfies are likely to look better on the OnePlus X.. So which is better? At the end of the day, they’re very, very close, but a quick math session. points to the OnePlus 2 being better based on the numbers.. If you’re looking for a phone to pick up at. this very moment, you’re likely better off. The OnePlus 2 was announced back in July, and hit stores in August. The OnePlus X was only recently announced and won’t be available. If you don’t mind waiting — or less capable hardware — opting for the OnePlus X will leave a smaller dent to the bank account. Well, assuming you can get one.. In order to get your hands on either version of the $250 OnePlus X Onyx , you’ll need to get an invite. will go out on November 24, with followup invitations continuing from there. There will also be open sales that will be held for longer and longer durations as supplies. $410 model called the OnePlus Ceramic will be available in Europe and India as well, but sadly, not in the United States. The OnePlus 2, on the other hand, is currently available through. the OnePlus website for $390 on a similar invite basis.. Both phones are notably cheaper than most of their competitors, though, and while the invitation system poses a bit of a delay between the time you purchase the device and actually receive it, it’s a small hurdle at best. Between the two, we’re going to give the OnePlus X this round. It might not be available for a few more weeks, but its cheaper price tag and increased availability make it a winner.. In most regards, the OnePlus X and OnePlus 2. are quite similar or downright equal, especially in regards to the. Their specs are also respectable, though, they won’t be winning any awards. Where the two differ the most is hardware, which is probably the most important aspect of any piece of tech. If you’re deciding between these two devices, the OnePlus 2 would likely perform better considering its. chipset outpaces that of the OnePlus X.. However, if that’s a non-issue for you, and you’re willing to wait a little longer, the OnePlus X is a fine choice as well.. Will OnePlus release a new OnePlus X model after the OnePlus 6?.

OnePlus X vs Sony Xperia Z5 Compact comparison. OnePlus knows how to make waves. It did it with the OnePlus One, it did it with its invite system, but can it do it again with the low-cost OnePlus X? The. OnePlus X looks great, but there’s. more to it than its appearance. Our OnePlus X review will take you through its features, specs, price, release date and performance. Is this the best phone you can buy for. X is now available through Amazon UK, with Amazon US to follow shortly. Head to the Release date and price section below for more details.. OnePlus X release date and price. The OnePlus X is a great buy if you can get one. The OnePlus X was officially available from November 5 (and from November 2 at. popup locations) but only under OnePlus' infamous invite system; that was until January 28, when OnePlus announced through its forums that it had done the world a favor and dismantled its invite system to make the OnePlus X freely available to all forever.. You can pick one up now whenever you like through the OnePlus website .. saw a permanent price drop on May 25. It is now available directly from OnePlus for $199 .. OnePlus further expanded the OnePlus X's availability. You can now purchase the device in black or white on Amazon UK , with Amazon US availability said to follow shortly.. The limited edition OnePlus X Ceramic cost $269 / 369 Euro / £269. It went on sale on 24 November. Only 10,000 were available and have long since sold out.. The OnePlus X had another variant to added to its roster. luxurious Champagne edition was made available on. The specs and price are the same as the Onyx edition, but the back and front of the phone are white, and the metal frame is champagne gold in color.. OnePlus X design and build quality. The attention to detail on the OnePlus X is impressive. The device as a whole may not cost much, but you get the sense that no corners were cut with this phone.. The metallic edge is etched with 17 "micro-cuts". The OnePlus X has a combination dual-SIM/SIM + microSD card tray. The Alert Slider is a premium feature for a phone this cheap. The nifty Alert Slider from the OnePlus 2 is. a nice addition to a phone that you might expect to miss out on a fancy feature like this.. The OnePlus X has a great, 5-inch Full HD AMOLED screen. The OnePlus X is a pretty remarkable looking phone for US$250. The OnePlus 2 looks great for its price point, but the cheaper OnePlus X actually looks even more premium. With its black onyx or baked ceramic finishes, it's very easy on the eye.. It's also very easy in the hand, thanks to its diminutive proportions. It's nice to see a smaller, 5-inch device in these days of 5.5-6-inch monsters, but size is always subjective. The OnePlus X will be too small for some but perfectly right for others. The Onyx version weighs 138 g and the Ceramic weighs 160 g. It has to be admitted though that both materials are huge fingerprint magnets.. The OnePlus X has an anodized metal frame, etched with 17 micro-cuts. This may sound like some kind of exotic torture technique, but it's a fine detail that adds to the overall impression that everything about the OnePlus X has been carefully considered and well thought-out. The device as a whole may not cost much, but you get the sense that no corners were cut with this phone.. According to OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, each ceramic back plate takes a month to craft and the baking process only has a 20 percent yield – that's not the kind of material you choose if you're trying to save a few bucks to get a product out the door. Come to mention it, you don't even find materials like ceramic on flagships at three times the price.. The difference between the two OnePlus X options comes down to more than just the material however, there's also a difference in the way the display glass and rear panel meet the metal frame. The OnePlus X Ceramic has an angled edge, whereas the Onyx version has a rounded display glass, similar to the 2.5D glass we're familiar with on the Nexus 6, Xiaomi Mi Note or iPhone 6.. The ribbed, “micro-cut” edge provides better grip and this is important, because with all that exposed glass and metal, this is not a phone you want to be dropping. There is a dual nano-SIM card tray that doubles as a microSD card slot if you're only using one SIM (it seems OnePlus learned from its mistake of not including this on the OnePlus 2). The OnePlus X only comes in a 16 GB version, but can be expanded up to 128 GB with a microSD card.. The OnePlus X reverts back to a USB 2.0 port on the bottom, in order to keep the OnePlus X as thin as possible. The charging port is flanked by dual speaker grills, although, as we seem to be seeing more often, only one of them emits any sound. The left grill hides a mono speaker and the one on the right is for the in-call microphone.. There's also no fingerprint scanner or NFC on the OnePlus X. There is however, both on-screen and capacitive buttons for navigation, which you can customize in the settings (the capacitive buttons are not backlit this time around). It should also be noted that the OnePlus X is quite slippery on flat surfaces, doing that spooky sliding-around-by-itself thing you might know from other oleophobic-coated phones.. The nifty Alert Slider from the OnePlus 2 makes an appearance on the champfered metal edge, providing a very easy way to switch between silent, all notifications and priority notifications modes without even having to turn your screen on. It’s a nice addition to a phone that you might expect to miss out on a fancy feature like this.. There's also a LED notification light, which you can customize in the settings, and on the back is a small camera lens, that – thankfully – sits flush with the back of the phone, alongside a single-LED flash. The front of the OnePlus X is coated in Gorilla Glass 3 and there's a free case included in the box in case you're worried about all that fragile-looking material.. The two versions of the OnePlus X also have a range of differently colored protective case options and you can soon buy an optional pair of in-ear earbuds called OnePlus Icons that apparently sound great but currently have a top secret (low) price. They'll also be out in time for Christmas so keep an ear out for those.. a happy coincidence that AMOLED display technology on a small device with a relatively small battery. You have the choice between on-screen or capacitive (but not backlit) buttons. The OnePlus X runs Oxygen OS 2.1.2 based on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. The OnePlus X returns to the days of more reserved display specs, with a Full HD 5-inch AMOLED screen (with 441 ppi), the first AMOLED display on any OnePlus device. With that in mind, the OnePlus X comes with a dark theme to make use of the deep blacks and saturated colors that AMOLED screens deliver, as well as a range of suitably dark background wallpapers.. While Pei assures me he believes LCD provides better colors than AMOLED, the OnePlus X had to use an AMOLED display to make it as thin as possible. It’s just a happy coincidence that this display technology on a small device with a relatively small battery happens to work well to prolong battery life. Incidentally, our OnePlus X also came with a screen protector stuck on the front.. There's also an optional ambient display mode, similar to what you may know from Motorola devices, where your notifications will appear on screen in what OnePlus is calling “duo-tone”. These screen-off notifications will appear at regular intervals as well as whenever you pass your hand over the device’s proximity sensor.. The OnePlus X also comes equipped with customizable accent colors and a system-wide dark theme, so you can set up your phone to make the best possible use of the battery saving properties of an AMOLED screen. If you don't care so much about power saving or an overly dark theme isn't for you, the OnePlus X also offers a white theme and bright, poppy accent colors.. The OnePlus X makes good use of blacks to save battery life. Oxygen OS has a light and dark theme, accent colors, customizable Quick Settings toggles and LED manager for custom notifications.. Oxygen OS is a very stock-looking ROM with plenty of customization. Unlike stock Android, Oxygen OS has a system-wide dark theme. The OnePlus X runs OnePlus' Oxygen OS 2.1.2 on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop and it received two patches during the time I was reviewing it: one performance update for Oxygen OS 2.1.2 and another patch to fix SD card issues (which, incidentally, I didn’t encounter before or after the update). While this update-heavy attitude might simply be reflective of the OnePlus X being brand new, it could also indicate there were a few problems that needed to be ironed out pronto.. The big difference in version 2.1 of the Oxygen OS is the addition of a manual mode to the camera, which works a treat for anyone frustrated by the limitations of a simple camera app but it has yet to arrive on the OnePlus X. Current changes include color offset fixes for HDR Mode and some UX bugs in the camera interface. The update also delivered some low battery optimizations and OTA stability fixes when updating.. For those unfamiliar with OnePlus’ tweaks to Android, Oxygen OS is a very stock-like ROM but it has plenty of customization options and available tweaks for those that like to modify their Android phone. These include off-screen gestures, where you draw patterns on the screen to quickly launch the camera, flashlight or control music. The OnePlus X also supports double tap to wake.. Another great feature of Oxygen OS on the OnePlus X is the ability to switch between on-screen or capacitive buttons, with the option to always enable the capacitive home button even when using on-screen buttons. Taking advantage of this feature lets you have an even faster shortcut to Google Now, as it launches instantly from the capacitive button but requires you to swipe up when using the on-screen button. You can also easily switch the functions of the on-screen or capacitive buttons.. The OnePlus X is pretty light on pre-loaded apps, only packing core apps you're likely to want to use and letting you choose the rest. Not having to de-bloat a phone right out of the box is a refreshing experience. mentioned above, Oxygen OS has a light and dark theme, accent colors, customizable Quick Settings toggles and LED manager for custom notifications. If you've used the OnePlus 2, this will all be familiar.. Oxygen OS has its own optional Google Now-like screen to the left of the main home screen. It's called Shelf and fortunately it's removable. It provides a quick shortcut to your favorite apps, contacts, weather information and so on, and will probably grow into a useful tool in time. But for now, it's a bit of a waste of space.. The OS also provides full control over individual app permissions, and the OnePlus X isn't even running Android Marshmallow yet. There is the possibility that a manufacturer version of granular permission control could break things, but then Google isn't guaranteeing everything will work perfectly either. A lot of that rides on the app developers themselves. Just be careful if you go playing around in here.. The OnePlus X's near-stock version of Android keeps its performance above average. It cannot be repeated enough how solid the OnePlus X is for a phone at this price point. While other similarly-priced phones might have slightly better performance, there is no chance they will look as good or feel as premium as this $250 wonder.. Far from the best, but the OnePlus X offers stable and reliable performance. The OnePlus uses the last widely acclaimed Snapdragon chipset: the Snapdragon 801. To even appear in the same vicinity as the Nexus 6 and OnePlus One is a good result. No one is going to buy the OnePlus X for its flagship performance – this phone was built to appeal to different sensibilities than those that simply seek raw power. But the OnePlus X isn’t exactly a weak-specced or stuttery phone either. Packing a quad-core, 32-bit Snapdragon 801, the OnePlus X uses the last widely acclaimed processor before the era of problematic 64-bit chips and overheating issues.. This means you’ll get reliable – if not high-end – performance from the OnePlus X. Backed up by 3 GB of RAM, the OnePlus X can handle plenty of app switching and multitasking and didn’t skip a beat throughout the time I spent with it. Of course, the OnePlus X offers lower performance than any current flagship but the stability and smoothness of the OnePlus X does a wonderful job of making it not seem “slow”.. OnePlus made the wise decision to include microSD expansion in the OnePlus X too. This decision satisfies three touchstones: pleasing die-hard fans of expandable storage, allowing the phone to remain as thin as possible and keeping its price low, because a microSD card slot means OnePlus can get away with only offering 16 GB of internal storage.. When Marshmallow arrives you'll be able to format your SD card to work as a seamless part of your phone's storage. Until Marshmallow arrives, accessing data stored on your SD card is going to be a little slower and less secure, but that’s no different than what you’d be used to on any other phone with an SD card slot right now.. In benchmarks the OnePlus X scores as you would expect it to running a Snapdragon 801 clocked at 2.3 GHz: hovering around the 38,000 point mark in AnTuTu with a slight decrease in performance in back-to-back tests. In Geekbench 3, single-core results ranged between 800-900 with multi-core scores between 2100-2500. Qualcomm’s Vellamo benchmark test produced a Metal score in the vicinity of the OnePlus One and Nexus 6, and a Multi-core score just below the Zenfone 2.. High-res gaming is pretty much off the table if you want a glitch-free experience, but the OnePlus X can handle almost everything else you throw at it. It cannot be repeated enough how solid the OnePlus X is for a phone at this price point. While other similarly-priced phones might have slightly better performance, there is no chance they will look as good or feel as premium as this $250 wonder.. A major setback for anyone who has bought or is looking to buy a OnePlus X in the US is that it doesn't support communication with the 700-MHz frequency. This falls in the frequency band that is most commonly used by AT&T and that T-Mobile is currently transferring to.. This means that you will have. difficulty connecting to an LTE network and maintaining that connection in many areas of the US if you use your device on AT&T or T-Mobile. Most often, it will revert to the HSPA network, which is significantly slower.. A word to the wise: don't expect great things from the speaker and you won't be disappointed.. The OnePlus X mono speaker isn't great but it's decently loud. As mentioned above, the OnePlus X has two speaker grills on the bottom edge, but only the left one of them produces sound. A word to the wise: don't expect great things from the speaker and you won't be disappointed. But it has to be admitted that it offers above average volume and sound quality for a phone this price. The fact it is even passable is a minor miracle, so count your lucky stars it’s as good as it is.. The more important thing to note about audio on the OnePlus X is the inclusion of an FM radio. According to OnePlus, FM radio is seeing a comeback in the US, as well as in places like India after a drop in popularity in recent years. You'll need headphones plugged in to use it, but it's a good option for listening to music without burning through data.. In-call sound quality is perfectly acceptable, although the OnePlus X doesn’t work on LTE bands 12 and 17, meaning AT&T and T-Mobile’s 700 MHz spectrum is out of bounds. There’s no issues being understood on either end of a call but you shouldn’t expect premium microphones or noise cancelation in this phone. For what you pay it’s still above average though.. The OnePlus X has a 13 MP ISOCELL camera with single LED flash and PDAF. The 8 MP front-facing camera on the OnePlus X does a decent job on selfies. The camera results on the OnePlus X are perfectly acceptable but nothing spectacular:. the camera is where the OnePlus X shows its price point.. The non-removable back cover hides a modest 2,525 mAh battery. The OnePlus X features a 13 MP main camera with f/2.2 aperture and an 8 MP front-facing camera with f/2.4 aperture. The OnePlus X uses a Samsung ISOCELL sensor and Phase Detection Auto-Focus (PDAF), capable of focus speeds as short as 0.2 seconds.. PDAF is actually slower than the laser auto-focus on the OnePlus 2, but Pei told me that if he'd had to remove any feature from the OnePlus 2 it would have been OIS or laser auto-focus (because of its limited effective range). The OnePlus X seems to be evidence of this, including neither feature. The main problem with PDAF is that it struggles in low light more than laser focus.. The camera results on the OnePlus X are perfectly acceptable but nothing spectacular. I was shooting photos on a pretty overcast day, but you can expect most phones to handle bright sunlight well. With the relatively dull light I was shooting in, the OnePlus X managed admirably enough, producing relatively accurate colors and decent enough contrast.. However, the OnePlus X struggled occasionally to focus in low-light situations and grain is clearly visible in these shots. They also lack the color saturation of better lit environments. In most outdoor scenes the OnePlus X had a habit of underexposing in the flat light. In shots like those of the swan, the OnePlus X overcompensates, blowing out highlights and destroying detail in the process.. Again, the results are perfectly acceptable for the price but the OnePlus X is not for you if you’re after premium smartphone photography capabilities. Colors tend to bleed out, noise creeps in and exposure settings are problematic. The lack of optical image stabilization also causes occasional problems with image blur.. The OnePlus X will receive an update that will address an occasional camera corruption issue that some owners have been experiencing. The update will come in at 9.5 MB and should be rolled out before the end of February 2016. Check out the official forum for more on the hotfix.. In terms of settings, the OnePlus X shoots at 12.4 MP at a 4:3 aspect ratio. You’ll have to drop to 7.9 MP to get 16:9 but there’s also a 9.3 MP Instagram mode for square shots. There’s also beauty mode (which works on the front-facing camera too) and HDR. Clear Image shoots multiple shots and stitches them together to create artificially high resolution, clear and noise-free images.. The OnePlus X also shoots 1,080p and 720p video as well as 720p slow motion video at 120 frames per second. You’ve also got a time lapse camera. As with the OnePlus 2, there's a range of ways to launch the camera: you can use a gesture, do it from the lock screen or use a button shortcut.. All things considered, the camera is where the OnePlus X shows its price point. To be fair, it had to come sooner or later, but anyone hoping the premium looks and feel of the OnePlus X would be carried over to camera performance will be disappointed. For the casual snapshot it’s fine, but there are definite limits to what you can get from this camera.. It's not all about the specs: the OnePlus X is all about how good it looks for the price. The OnePlus X has a decent sized battery for a phone of this size and thickness: 2,525 mAh. It's non-removable, of course, but considering the energy saving properties of AMOLED screens, it manages acceptably. With moderate usage you can make it from breakfast to dinner time, but you’d be lucky to get anything beyond that.. If you make use of the dark theme, ambient display and keep your brightness setting relatively low you won’t have any problems with the OnePlus X battery, and when Android Marshmallow arrives with Doze Mode and App Standby things will get even better. But for now the battery is acceptable and not much more. Sadly, there’s no rapid charging capability on the OnePlus X, so charging time needs to be a consideration.. Once the battery settles in a bit (it’s only been through a handful of cycles so far) we’ll update this review with some benchmark results and some more real-world observations, so stay tuned. Based on our experience so far though, we reliably got three to three and a half hours of screen-on time with around a 12-hour battery life.. 140 x 69 x 6.9 mm. 1920 x 1080 pixels (441 ppi). The OnePlus X is, simply put, a beautiful phone at a very good price.. OnePlus is clear that the X is not meant to be a powerhouse like the main OnePlus flagship – and it is not. The X series is where OnePlus will try out new options, primarily material, whereas the main device is where the newest technologies will be foregrounded. This is why the OnePlus X isn't pumping high-end specs but shooting for exquisite styling instead. You need to understand this before you consider buying this phone. If you’re after performance, get a OnePlus 2 instead.. If the design and price of the OnePlus X appeal to you then you should definitely give it a look. But it has to be said that the processor and camera are not the OnePlus X’s strong points. The OnePlus X is, simply put, a beautiful phone at a very good price. That’s what I thought when I first saw it, and that’s what I still think after spending a week with it.. I found the OnePlus X's performance to be perfectly adequate – actually better than I expected – and its camera and battery life was acceptable, just. But I never expected them to be anything else. When you boil it all down, the OnePlus X is all about surface: you get what you see, from great styling to great software. If you don’t expect any untold performance depths beneath that gorgeous exterior and bargain price tag. How can you not list the non-LTE compatibility as a con? I read the whole dumb article only to get to the deal breaker at the end.. wen One plus 3 will be launched in india ?. The Oneplus X does have noise-cancelling😏. OnePlus Phones are now on sale only at goo.gl/5z1kVj. why is a 2013 processor considered as a con? most the phones in this price range come with snapdragon 615 or 410. a 2013 801 is so much better than that. One of the best smartphones in the market. Bought it from GeekBuying with the coupon 10OFFCOUPON and got it 10$ cheaper. OnePlus Phones are now on sale only at goo.gl/5z1kVj. I have an invite that I intended to use but since it has shitty LTE coverage with at&tt, I refuse. I put my phone on hspa for a weekend to test myself if I could handle if and I couldn't. That's when I made the decision to let the invite go to waste. It would have been a phone to have for a change to try something different than a nexus. But going to a mostly hspa+ phone is not how I intend on dumping 250 bucks. "the OnePlus X uses the last widely acclaimed processor before the era of problematic 64-bit chips and overheating issues." Wouldn't that have been the Snapdragon 805, not the less capable 801?. My Oneplus X got around 41000 points in Antutu. Pretty much a 3G phone in the States. You can't just buy it anyway so it's just as well.. This is absolutely critical to the success of the OPX in the US. Interesting statement....has the same bands as my Nexus 5(4G/LTE)....???. Damn I got an invite to buy one last week but forgot to use it. Just got my new OP2 yesterday. Satisfied as hell ) But the problem is I cannot use my favorite Supernet VPN on it because of Oxygen ((. But if something happens you can't find out with support. I was talking to Carl Pei recently and he is very aware of OnePlus' reputation for service. He said they are working really hard to make customer service one of the cornerstones of what OnePlus stands for in future.. don't like to admit it but that's a nice device, not many small(?) well specced compact phones around..... Well the Xperia Z5 Compact is a very well-equipped phone, but it kinda costs a lot more than this!. MWC 2018 live updates: Sony shakes up the Xperia XZ2 design. * Please enter a valid email address.

Tesla's electric trucks may be more cost-effective than expected. OnePlus X series is no more, says CEO. The smartphone maker will focus on just one "true flagship" line from now on.. OnePlus CEO Pete Lau shows off his company's latest flagship phone, the OnePlus 3.. While it's common practice for smartphone makers to offer two or three product lines to cover all the bases, OnePlus has recently decided to go from two to one. At the OnePlus 3 launch event in Shenzhen today, CEO Pete Lau confirmed that his company's more affordable offering, the OnePlus X , will not have a follow-up model. That's not to say it was a bad phone (even we liked it) nor was it unpopular, but Lau said that OnePlus will instead focus on just one "true flagship" line from now on in order to strengthen its foundation -- something that Lau admitted his team neglected last year -- rather than fighting the low-end price war.. Part of this long-term plan includes merging OnePlus' development resources for the global Oxygen OS (near-native Android) and the China-only Hydrogen OS (skinned Android), and we're told to expect an announcement on that end later this year. Lau added that he'll continue to invest in after-sale services and offer more lifestyle products -- like the new series of bags unveiled at the show -- to further promote his brand.. Judging by last night's Loop VR virtual launch event, plus the new fancy promotional videos, it appears that OnePlus has been spending more money on marketing as well, though Lau said he'll still be avoiding the conventional advertising channels in order to pass the savings on to his customers. And yes, OnePlus is still going to make a profit off its competitively priced phone, because "we still gotta make money at the end of the day; it's just a matter of how you do it and how much you want to make.". Without giving away sales figures, Lau pointed out that his company is doing very well across Europe, India and the US. He expects Europe to remain OnePlus' fastest-growing market, while the company continues to be the top brand in the $300-plus category in India, as reflected by Amazon India's best-seller chart, according to the exec. Unlike its local competitors, though, OnePlus will remain cautious in China and focus its resources on its online channels, and it won't be opening any new physical stores there. "This will all make sense in 20 years' time," Lau added. "Some vendors say the online model is stalling, so they badmouth it, but I see that as an opportunity. You just have to remain persistent.". Unlike in previous launches, the OnePlus 3 has ditched the much-loathed invite system and can be ordered immediately (mass production had already started last month), so it shouldn't be long before we see whether the company's new strategy will pay off. "We hope that once our fans have played with the OnePlus 3, they will feel the same way they did with the OnePlus One," Lau said.. china , gear , interview , mobile , oneplus , oneplus3 , oneplusx , petelau.

Users looking for daily office related apps and that kind of usage must go for it. Heavy gaming app users should go for one plus 2. Best thing is the screen clarity and 3 GB RAM which makes it superb to use. Great body build is an added advantage!. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Superb mid range phone with stunning looks and great experience. Style: New | Colour: Onyx | Verified Purchase. Firstly the OPX which falls in the mid range price segment does not feel mid range when you hold this phone. The aesthetics feels premium because of the glass panel in the rear and metal finish on the sides. One plus ships the phone with a screen protector and transparent case to protect the phone from accidental falls. This is a good move by the company given there aren't any accessories available in the market yet. Camera: The best part of the camera is the lightening fast shutter speed. Camera photos come out good with enough detail, though a bit noisy Battery : The battery life is average which lasts for little over a day with 2-3 hours of browsing on WiFi and 1hour of calling. I haven't faced any heating issues with the phone so far. Build quality : Build quality is top-notch, the metal frame looks good and provides great grip, while the onyx glass rear are what makes the OnePlus X look stunning, however the navigation keys should have been backlit Display: The display is excellent: it isn't among the brightest AMOLED displays but offers very deep blacks, excellent viewing angles and sunlight legibility. OS: Oxygen OS is a clean and light Android skin, which let's you enjoy the pure Android experience and the added extras such as the Ambient screen and unlocking gestures; The quad-core Snapdragon 801 is still quite a capable processor and a relevant performer. The 3GB of RAM will make multi-taskers happy; Speaker :Loudspeaker performance is about Average. Video : Video player supports all video formats but AC3 audio and subtitles are a no-go. The 1080p video samples are subpar and comparatively are not as good as the ones by the competition Audio : Audio quality is decent with an external amplifier, but quickly turns to below average when the headphones are plugged in; Conclusion : OnePlus X will be a memorable mid-ranger everyone will want. It's an excellent piece of tech, a snappy performer with a lively hi-res AMOLED screen, with proper camera experience and all-round connectivity package.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Love it. Style: New | Colour: Onyx | Verified Purchase. I ordered the phone last night , I received it today morning. Amazon service is commendable and I recommend it to everyone. They do not dupe their customers by deleting their reviews , and most reviews are by verified customers. I have been using the one plus X purchased by my friend for a month almost , I was so impressed with it that I went ahead and bought one for myself. The phone looks premium , and I mean that in every sense of the word , the Gorilla glass front and back , the textured sides , the very tactile buttons , sturdy feel in hand , it leads you to believe that the phone costs a lot more than it actually is ,at 17000 it supercedes the build quality of any phone in this range. The oxygen OS on the phone is a mildly modified version of Android , and it is faithful to stock Android and doesn't deviate much from it like the bundled and bloated UIs of Samsung HTC and the like , if you are a fan of the no nonsense Android UI ,you will love this phone. Apart from the one plus radio and swift key there aren't any bloat ware on the phone. Yes oxygen OS has some bugs like not being able to recognize your SD card , some lag on chrome and YouTube , but those have been fixed by the update I got the second I turned on my phone. Minor bugs might still be present but nothing that would be too noticeable. The screen on this phone is it's USP , it has a full HD amoled display , which is bloody brilliant , the blacks are so inky and dark that you can't tell the difference between the display and the bezel when on a black wallpaper , to know what I mean , just play a 1080 p video on YouTube and see how wonderful it looks on this screen. The contrast ratios are mind blowing and I cannot see a single pixel on the screen. The phone comes with a back cover , a screen protector already on and a standard charger with a Data cable. The data cable is a flatwire and is of Superior quality. The packaging has been thought through and it feels premium right out of the box. Now for the cons , the battery is on the weaker side , it will last you a working day , but you will definitely have to charge it by 7-8 if you use 3g or WiFi and make about 10 calls a day. The phone does tend to heat mildly , not as much as the negative reviews suggest ,but enough to know that the phone is warmer in the hand , This might be nitpicking but the phone does not come with a headphone. Most of us have one anyway and even if they did the headphones couldn't be any great. I recommend this highly to anyone who is looking for a mid range budget phone which does most things well and some things fantastically.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent phone for the price. Style: New | Colour: Onyx | Verified Purchase. Here is my 1 week review - The phone looks superb. The metal body gives a premium look and the protective cover provided with the box is also solid. The only thing that might bother people is the screen is a finger print magnet but it can be ignored - Talking about the screen, it is breath taking. There are situations at night, where I reduce the brightness to 0% as even at about 10% it is too bright - Snapdragon processor with 3GB RAM works like a charm. Apps like google maps loads in seconds and have never experienced any lag or freeze even with 10-12 apps running in the background - Coming to the battery, it will lasts a day with moderate usage on 3G/WiFi (100% at 9 AM, 20% at 12 midnight) - The speakers are also great and is loud enough even at 60% volume - Camera is also good provided the price range the phone is in. Low light photography is also good. The front camera is one of the best there is for mid range phones - Lastly Oxygen OS gives a near vanilla experience and there are no bloatware which is great.

OnePlus X review One of the best bang for your buck smartphones of the year. by Joshua Vergara November 19, 2015. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. - AMOLED display leveraged well via Dark Mode and Ambient Display. - Performance still reliable, even if not blazing fast. - Return to microUSB port, at least for now. - Great price, makes it accessible for just about anyone. - Snapdragon 801 really showing its age. - Lack of NFC, wireless charging, fast charging. - Camera is inconsistent, especially video. - Software still needs polish, somewhat buggy. - Lack of LTE bands makes phone not futureproof in US. With a premium body and solid internals, what we have is a device that might be OnePlus's most compelling yet. It is certainly not without its flaws, and may not be future proof, but for now, the OnePlus X is one of the best bang for your buck smartphones of the year.. Connectivity 2.4GHz b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, GLONASS, BDS, LTE. SIM card Nano SIM, dual compatible (but uses microSD slot). Camera 13MP ISOCELL 3M2 CMOS with f/2.2 rear cam, 8MP front cam. Battery Non-removable 2,525 mAh LiPo battery. Software Oxygen OS (based on Lollipop). Dimensions 140 x 69 x 6.9 mm, 138g for Onyx, 160g for Ceramic. Boasting a design overhaul and a compelling price point, OnePlus is hoping to marry the features of their most recent flagship, the OnePlus 2 , with the value of its predecessor. Will the first mid-range offering from the company prove to be the smartphone for you? We find out, in this comprehensive OnePlus X review!. Design is definitely the most striking aspect of the OnePlus X, with the large bodies and subtle curves that define its flagship siblings no longer to be found. Instead, what we get now is a black slate device, utilizing dual glass panels and a metal frame for that premium touch. There is a ceramic version of the phone available as well, where the back is made with a substantially heavier fire-baked ceramic material. That is a special edition of sorts, however, and the glass-encased “Onyx” edition seen in this review is the one that isÂ. Starting with the metal frame, there are a number of micro-cuts in it that contribute a lot to the handling experience. In case you were worried, these micro-cuts don’t scrape the skin and aren’t uncomfortable to the touch, but rather provide a reassuring feel when holding the device. All the buttons are on the right side, with the power button below the dual SIM/microSD tray and the volume rocker, and on the other side is a feature returning from the OnePlus 2, the Alert Slider. The bottom marks OnePlus’ return to the microUSB charging port, and despite appearances, only the left grill houses a speaker.. The 5-inch screen is just the right size for comfortable one-handed usage, and above it is the proximity sensor that helps trigger the Ambient Display feature. look is required to see the markings for the capacitive navigation keys below the display, and as mentioned during the unboxing , these buttons are placed really close to the bottom, and that does take a little getting used to in terms of reaching them. On the back, the OnePlus logo is front and center, with the camera optics nestled in the corner.. We had several “smaller” devices this year, but the OnePlus X comes with a pretty sleek design to keep this form factor feeling pretty fresh. One-handed usage is a highlight here, with the flat sides and those micro-cuts really helping the phone sit snug in the hand while reaching from side to side. There are some drawbacks here however, with the dual glass design making for an incredibly fingerprint-prone device, and you will find yourself wiping it down often to keep things pristine.. Of course, there are some obvious sources of inspiration as well, but OnePlus does do a good job of having enough differentiating factors. Ultimately, the OnePlus X is a pretty premium looking and feeling device, that somewhat surprises when you consider how much, or how little, you will be paying for it.. The OnePlus X features a 5-inch AMOLED display with a 1920 x 1080 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 441 ppi. 1080p allows for the right kind of display experience for a phone like this, with some punched up colors due to the black levels an AMOLED screen allows for. It is good that, despite being an affordable device with a small form factor, OnePlus didn’t decide to bump the resolution down to 720p. Text is sharp enough for a 5-inch display when reading, and media looks really good as well. Brightness is also pretty high, and at the highest level, the white areas of the screen might actually be a little blinding even in normal lighting conditions.. AMOLED is taken advantage of by the OnePlus software, with its Ambient Display feature, that can be triggered by waving your hand over the proximity sensor, with the screen then showing the minimal version of the lockscreen for a quick glance at your notifications. The Oxygen OS theme is also set to Dark Mode by default, which is a really nice touch and allows for a battery life boost, by keeping the AMOLED screen from showing too many bright colors.. Related: OnePlus X best cases. Under the hood, the OnePlus X comes with a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor, clocked at 2.3 GHz, and backed by the Adreno 330 GPU and 3 GB of RAM. This processor was the 2014 flagship standard and was also found with the OnePlus One , save for the additional gig of RAM, and helps make a case that last year’s phones are certainly viable options in the current smartphone space. With daily tasks, like writing emails, listening to music, watching the occasional video, and general web browsing, the OnePlus X doesn’t skip a bit, and only when firing up the more recent graphically-intensive games is where you experience a slowdown.. Of course, when actually compared to current generation flagship smartphones, the Snapdragon 801 does show its age, and while some of the blame may lie on the extraÂ. polish that the Oxygen OS may still need, instances of stutter were fairly common. From little stutters when YouTube started playing a video, to the small but noticeable occurrences of Fleksy fumbling a letter, it became clear that while this is still a very viable processing package, it is still over a year old. Though the vast majority of users will be hard-pressed to notice these little issues, and future Oxygen OS updates will certainly also help smooth out the rough edges, it is still important to know what you will be dealing with.. In hardware, the OnePlus X retains some of the features from the OnePlus 2, while adding some new hardware elements as well, with the main omission this time around being the fingerprint scanner. Just like on the OnePlus 2, NFC isÂ. The Alert Slider is back however, and proves itself to be a really easy way of silencing the phone, with the middle position being useful only as long as you have your priority notifications set up properly.. Even though there are two grills at the bottom flanking the microUSB port, only the left grill houses the single speaker unit that provides audio skewed towards the higher ends, which is a little unpleasant, despite the speaker itself being able to get pretty loud. Using a good pair of headphones will allow for a much better audio experience. The wires also serve an extra purpose, with the OnePlus X coming with a radio tuner, which works as well as can be expected, and is a nice addition to have if you want to listen to local stations.. Another feature that is retained from the OnePlus 2 is the dual SIM tray, but the secondary SIM slot now doubles as a microSD card slot, which will certainly be appreciated, since the 16 GB of on-board storage will not be enough for most people. Of course, users will have to make a choice between dual SIM capabilities or expandable storage, but any implementation that allows for the latter is a big plus.. On the battery front, the OnePlus X packs a 2,525 mAh unit, which is pretty standard for a phone of this size, but actually allowed for pretty surprising results. With moderate usage, the device allows for around 3 hours of screen-on time, which seems pretty average, but means more when factoring in the low price of this smartphone. The standby time is also quite impressive, with due credit being given to the AMOLED display and features like Ambient Display and Dark Mode. There is no fast charging or wireless charging however.. One aspect of hardware that definitely needs to be addressed is with regards to mobile connectivity in the US. You may have already heard that the OnePlus X lacks a couple of key bands to access high-speed internet, one required for AT&T, and the other for T-Mobile. The AT&T issue keeps the phone from maintaining a steady LTE connection consistently, and for T-Mobile, the carrier’s gradual change to that particular band will cripple any LTE access. This is certainly a very big deal for any of you in the US, and brings up the point that if you are hoping to use the OnePlus X on these networks, this phone may come with an expiration date. The device is a very viable choice in other markets around the world, but it will help to be aware of these facts if you are planning to pick up this device in the US.. The OnePlus X comes with a 13 MP rear camera that uses phase detection autofocus and leverages HDR, along with a 8 MP front-facing shooter, that allows for some detailed selfies. The camera application is the same as the one found with the OnePlus 2, which uses swipes on the viewfinder in order to switch between various modes, including slow motion video, time lapse, and panorama. Going to the last mode means a change to the portrait orientation, which can be quite annoying. There isn’t much manual control available, aside from basically just being able to trigger HDR.. Taking a look at the camera samples, we find the OnePlus X guilty of someÂ. It’s great in good lighting conditions, but quality deteriorates drastically as conditions worsen, and taking a shot will always require a very steady hand. The app is fast enough, getting shots done in a decent amount of time, but even in medium light situations, the camera opts for slower shutter speeds in order to compensate for exposure. Slower shutter speeds are of course not a bad thing as such, but it does make getting good results in low light conditions difficult.. This actually becomes more of an issue with video capture, which gets a bit choppy more often than not, and is one of the main flaws that was observed in the camera experience. Going back to the images, darker areas are still quite fuzzy, which is expected, but aren’t particularly bad to look at. Colors are not particularly dull either, but could use a little bit more punch. Using HDR in these scenarios just results in a brighter picture, instead of a more vivid photo, which isn’t ideal. For a daily shooter, the OnePlus X requires a little more diligence to get good shots, but for its price point, we don’t fault the camera too muchÂ. for that, unless your focus is video recording.. On the software side of things, we have the return of the OnePlus built Oxygen OS, which brings a mostly stock-looking Android edition to the OnePlus X. Much of it is really familiar, with a Lollipop inspired interface that includes the paginated app drawer and the Quick Settings menu.. Shelf, where frequent apps and favorite contacts, along with user-defined widgets, can be stored, is off by default, but it is certainly a good place to put your widgets and helps avoid using a lot of homescreens. More input options are available, with users given the choice between capacitive keys or on screen navigation keys, and gestures like double tap to wake are to be found as well.. Even if it’s not based on Marshmallow, Oxygen boastsÂ. App Permissions, a feature that gives a nice insight into the kind of things applications are attempting to access.Â. We have already mentioned Dark Mode a few times, and it is simply a bit nicer on the eyes, and the battery, and it has even got an option to cater the accent colors for a bit of a different look. By highlighting the Dark Mode, OnePlus has taken that little step to make its version of Android a touch different from stock versions, and given that the company prides itself on being different, we can certainly expect more additions to the Oxygen OS to further set it apart.. Priced at just $250, a premium body and good internals make the OnePlus X quite a steal. Of course, OnePlus’ infamous invite system does return, but small windows for open sales will be available, before gradually becoming free from requiring any invitations.. So, there you have it for this in-depth look at the OnePlus X! With that low price, the X might beÂ. The OnePlus X makes no pretenses about being a flagship smartphone, and understandably doesn’t meet that standard. We do think that the device is a great phone, but that phraseÂ. almost always ends with the phrase, “for the price.” Granted, it isn’t future proof, and for users who need LTE in the US, the expiration date may be sooner rather than later, but for now, the OnePlus X is one of the best smartphoneÂ.

Take a look at any roundup of the best smartphones under $300 and you’re bound to find a list of compromises. Moto G and ASUS’s ZenFone 2 bring useful. features like waterproofing or high-end silicon,. but skimp on fit and finish. Devices like the BLU Vivo Air go the other way, delivering. a sleek and slender build but sacrificing essentials like LTE in the process. This is understandable given the enormous challenges inherent in modern smartphone design; after all, manufacturers can only deliver so much quality at a given price.. With its newest smartphone, OnePlus looks. At $249, the OnePlus X is the company’s most affordable handheld ever – but you wouldn’t know it by looking at it. The OnePlus X is a gorgeous smartphone, and it packs a beautiful display and a capable feature set as well. In some ways it even eclipses its higher-end sibling, the OnePlus 2. With almost a third of its press release devoted to a description of the manufacturing “crafting”. positions the X as an artisanal smartphone, fusing “sleek design with flagship-level performance.”. claim as common as it is ostentatious. – and like most phones, the OnePlus X doesn’t quite live up to. The result is a unique Android smartphone whose charms mostly outweigh its faults (so long as you keep its price tag in mind).. While our initial hands-on featured the more expensive ceramic edition, our review device is the standard Onyx. A pane of Gorilla Glass 3 up front and one of “fire-baked scratch-resistant glass” on the backside come together in an aluminum alloy midplate featuring Art Deco-style striping and subtle chamfers that twinkle in the light. The volume and power buttons are textured in radial circles, standing out much more readily than their equivalents. on the OnePlus 2 and delivering better mechanical feedback as well. OnePlus has also carried over the notification slider from. its flagship, allowing ringer settings to be changed with the flick of a switch.. In the hand, the feel is nothing short of sublime. 5-inch display with fairly minimal bezels, OnePlus has produced. a rarity in the Android world: a smallish phone with top-shelf design that can be comfortably used one-handed.. Because this is a OnePlus device running OxygenOS, you don’t need to reach to the top of the screen for notifications, or. below the screen for the capacitive keys (more on this below) but you absolutely. can if you want to. reminds us of Sony’s Compact series, but at a lissome. the OnePlus X is nowhere near as girthy as those devices have become. And the use of a Full-HD AMOLED panel means that blacks blend right in with the bezel, while colors seem to leap right off the screen. This is another area where the OnePlus X outshines its more-expensive forerunner the OnePlus 2, whose LCD panel seems. To heap more praise upon the hardware would be to run the risk of gushing, so let’s cover the negatives. To start with: this is one of the most slippery phones we’ve ever used. Not since the LG Optimus G have we encountered a device that so readily slithers across a tabletop, pant leg or armrest – and our review device bears the scratches from no less than five. falls on hardwood flooring to prove it. While the glass has resisted shattering from drops of up to three feet, the. might be easier to live with. did a better job resisting smudges,. but the OnePlus X is an absolute magnet for fingerprints. Sadly, they can’t be put to any practical use:. there’s no fingerprint reader in sight.. office-friendly radio station, is “a blend of yesterday and today.” An older quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 sits at the heart of the device, backed up by 3GB of LPDDR3 RAM and 16GB of storage, 11.5 of which is available to the user.. Augmenting that storage is a MicroSD expansion slot good for another 128GB, or you. can choose to double up on SIMs and use the phone on more than one wireless carrier. to choose which SIM is active at any given time, both SIM slots are 4G-enabled. Unfortunately, the OnePlus X lacks NFC, making it incompatible with Android Pay. Perhaps more seriously, it also omits LTE Band 12 and Band 17 support, which significantly affects. 4G coverage on both T-Mobile and AT&T (see Performance, below).. The OnePlus X runs OxygenOS 2.1.2, a custom fork of Android 5.1.1 that we explored in detail in. The below impressions have been carried over from that review, with modifications where necessary.. Waking the OnePlus X from standby. is a simple matter of double-tapping the home screen or pressing the power/standby button, which. is positioned perfectly for our average-sized man-hands. The OnePlus X also offers an enhanced version of the Nexus family’s Ambient Display; when there’s a waiting notification, the phone periodically projects it onto the screen in power-saving monochrome. the Nexus implementation with Proximity Wake, which uses the front-facing camera to trigger Ambient Display when a hand is waved over the phone’s face.. isn’t nearly as tall as the OnePlus 2, it’s still nice to be able to deploy the notification shade with a swipe-down gesture anywhere on the homescreen. You can also control which shortcut toggles you want displayed within. what accent and LED colors suit you best;. and you get much finer control over app permissions than a device running stock Lollipop. Also carried over from the OnePlus 2: the ability to run a systemwide “light” or “dark” theme.. Since OnePlus opted not to include LEDs for the X’s capacitive buttons, we chose to. sacrifice some screen real estate for the always-on softkeys instead. As before, the position of the back and multitasking keys. If you decide to stick with the physical buttons despite their lack of illumination, you get some more shortcut options as well.. the camera or opening Google Now.. How much value OxygenOS offers will depend on how you prefer to use your smartphone.. Drawing a circle or a “V” on the glass will launch the camera or the flashlight, respectively … a cute but convoluted. other quick-launch options out there. (Turning on Ambient Display largely circumvents these gestures, as the phone almost always wakes the screen. from a pocket.) The “Shelf” that OnePlus has anchored to the leftmost home screen remains little more than. a vertically-scrolling list of widgets, coupled with a rough. Sense Home ; while it occasionally comes in handy, it can be disabled if you want to do your own thing.. While it would certainly be nice to run stock Marshmallow on the OnePlus X, OxygenOS remains one of our favorite Android flavors.. Its added features are convenient at best and inoffensive at worst, and. do a nice job of complementing the beautiful. OnePlus tells us a Marshmallow update is coming “sometime next year,” but the company has yet to commit to a firm date.. the OnePlus 2, the OnePlus X features a 13MP camera sensor. – but the similarities end there. Rather than sticking with its predecessor’s. OmniVision sensor, OnePlus has opted for a Samsung ISOCELL module (Samsung. 3M2 CMOS, the same sensor used by the Oppo R7 ) featuring an f /2.2 aperture and no optical image stabilization. The result is a camera that produces adequate results in bright light – and that’s about as good as it gets.. If you’re planning on keeping and showing most of your photos on the phone itself, the AMOLED display helps a lot by artificially boosting contrast and saturation. Take them off the device though, and the colors. and the detail falls apart, edges corrupted by digital noise, a smooth blue sky devolving into a grainy stretch of dusty felt. Colorful rows of pink flower petals appear as a washed-out expanse of salmon-colored feathers.. The lower the light gets, the tougher it becomes to gain and keep focus: we’ve shot. acceptable night photos right alongside terrible ones, with the only difference being half a second and a minor focus adjustment.. mild grain in good lighting degrades. into full-bore digital noise at night. Setting the phone to HDR mode helps it gather more light in very dim nighttime scenes, and using the resolution-enhancing Clear Image mode does add needed sharpness by combining multiple exposures into one large photo, but these are inconsistent workarounds.. There’s absolutely nothing special about the phone’s video performance, which maxes out at 1080p and exhibits many of the same handicaps as the stills do, with the added shakes and shimmies. that come from a lack of stabilization (see review video, above).. Selfie quality on the front-facing 8MP camera varies significantly depending on lighting, but as with most selfie shooters, it’s good enough given plenty of. Its skin-smoothing Beauty Mode –which is enabled by default– does a good job of spiffing up your. camera is probably the weakest aspect of the OnePlus X. This is no great surprise given its price point; it’s tough. for most OEMs to get the camera right on even the most expensive. And for those who confine their photo sharing to casual stints on Facebook and Twitter it’ll get the job done. those who take a measure of pride in their smartphone photography (even mildly-serious. Instagram devotees) may want to look elsewhere.. The camera isn’t the only corner OnePlus seems to have cut in order to hit. days of usage on T-Mobile and AT&T in. opened our eyes to a few pain points.. Probably the most significant of these, for US customers, is 4G. As mentioned above, the OnePlus X lacks support for LTE Band 12 and Band 17. That means it’s completely incapable of using either T-Mobile’s or AT&T’s. 700 MHz spectrum in the United States, which is a shame because those bands are particularly well-suited to indoor coverage. In our test market (Eastern Suffolk County, NY), that had little bearing on T-Mobile performance but sometimes. prevented us from using AT&T’s 4G network at all. We even got an oddball text message from AT&T upon inserting our SIM, informing us that our “2G device” would soon be obsoleted and encouraging us to visit a store to upgrade. While it’s possible this was a symptom of a badly-provisioned SIM or an improper APN selection, it was still frustrating to be confined to 3G on America’s second-largest network. If you live in a market serviced exclusively by AT&T Band 17 or one which T-Mobile. is targeting for Band 12 inclusion,. you’ll want to think twice about picking up the OnePlus X.. as well as phones that include support for these lower frequencies, more of which can be expected to hit the scene as carriers roll out more coverage in the 700 MHz band. (On the bright side, none of this affects voice quality: the OnePlus X. features a clear earpiece, and its 138g mass. is no burden to hold up for a long call.). Other handicaps are less significant but still worth mentioning. The bottom-firing speaker –only the left-hand grill seems to conceal. easy to accidentally block with a finger, and while it’s usually loud enough, it’s prone to raspy playback.. Battery life is better than we expected given the smallish 2525 mAh power pack, but it’s nothing special: while we were able to hit 4 hours of screen-on-time once over. a moderate day of usage, a maximum of 3 hours SoT was more typical. That’s similar to the performance we got out of the Moto X Pure Edition – but that phone could be recharged rapidly, while the OnePlus X can’t.. The lack of Qualcomm QuickCharge means that even using a 25W TurboPower adapter, the OnePlus X charges at a plodding. or less through its USB 2.0 port.. As you might expect given the phone’s aging silicon, performance suffers somewhat in high-demand applications. which used to run quite well on the 801, have seen upgrades since to. As a result the OnePlus X struggles to run the game smoothly. (“medium” is about as high as we could go to maintain a playable frame rate). swipes and taps the phone is usually very snappy, but like some other devices it does bog down during rapid typing. Fortunately these slowdowns are confined to specific and small corners of the experience.. OnePlus could have done with a more-modern midrange processor like the Snapdragon 617, which serves the. HTC One A9 quite well (and brings rapid charging to boot).. Excellent fit and finish at a manageable size +. Useful software improvements +. Lacks important LTE bands for the US –. The OnePlus X will go on sale in the US on November 19th, following initial availability in Europe which began November 5. The phone is available for purchase through. OnePlus’s invite system , which distributes invitations to purchase by means of. a reservation list, as well as via. Additionally, buyers who have purchased a OnePlus X can invite others to buy the device.. Those prices apply only to the Onyx (glass) edition; the Ceramic version of the OnePlus X costs €369 and will be confined to a limited run of 10,000 units, available through special invites in the EU and India markets only starting November 24.. At its base price, the Onyx edition of the OnePlus X comes in just $80 cheaper than the OnePlus 2. The larger model outshines it in virtually every sense,. from processor to power pack, so the natural question is: who’d buy the X when they could get the 2? Or better yet, who’d buy the X when they could spend $70 less on the very capable Moto G ?. The answer is simple: the OnePlus X wasn’t built for those. who notice or care about gigahertz or milliamps, water resistance or drop tests. accessory first and a capable smartphone second; those who don’t mind waiting another few seconds for an app to load, as long as they look good doing it. It was built, in short, for the exact opposite. of the typical OnePlus 2 buyer.. For those people, the OnePlus X is an excellent option. dated processor and mediocre camera will probably go mostly. unnoticed, drowned out by the brilliant build quality. and a cohesive software experience that’s absurdly good at this price point. Even those with more demanding mobile needs may be tempted by the potent mixture of a sensibly-sized Android smartphone with a reasonable price tag in tow.. In terms of fit and finish, the OnePlus X. is the gold standard of midrange smartphones. may be able to find a smarter sidekick … but you’re not likely to find a prettier one..
