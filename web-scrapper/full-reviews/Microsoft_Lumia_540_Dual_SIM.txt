CNET también está disponible en español.. 5-inch, dual-SIM Microsoft Lumia 540 sells for $150 in Europe, Asia, Middle East. The new, boldly colored Windows phone has an 8-megapixel camera and goes on sale in May.. by April 15, 2015 7:03 AM PDT. Microsoft is at it again, releasing the next in its line of increasingly indistinguishable Lumia phones.. This time it's the Lumia 540 Dual SIM, for which the biggest claims to fame are its large, 5-inch screen, its double-barrel SIM slots and its low price: $150, or, converted, about £100 and AU$200.. Digging into the specs, we get a 1,280x720-pixel HD resolution for that 5-inch display, which is about as low as you can go on a screen of this size and still have it be readable. An 8-megapixel camera on the rear includes autofocus and an LED flash, while the 5-megapixel front-facing shooter has wide-angle selfies covered.. Phones of every color of the rainbow (pictures). Inside, a 1.2 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 processor keeps the phone going, as does its removable 2,200mAh battery. You're also looking at 1GB RAM and only 8GB of internal storage, which you can supplement with up to 128GB more through a microSD card slot and 15GB in the cloud.. As far as specs go, this is a modest set that lines up with an unarguably low price. The idea here is that budget followers can still have their big-screen cake and eat it, too.. Microsoft finishes the Lumia 540 Dual SIM, which goes on sale in May in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, in the Lumia line's now signature cyan and eye-searing orange (glossy), as well as the more demure white and black (matte)..

From left to right, the Lumia 1320 , the Lumia 535 , and the Lumia 530 .. Microsoft Lumia (previously the Nokia Lumia Series ) is a former line of mobile devices that was originally designed and marketed by Nokia and later by Microsoft Mobile. Introduced in November 2011, the line was the result of a long-term partnership between Nokia and Microsoft —as such, Lumia smartphones run on Microsoft software, the Windows Phone operating system; and later the newer Windows 10 Mobile. The Lumia name is derived from the partitive plural form of the Finnish word lumi , meaning "snow". On 3 September 2013, Microsoft announced its purchase of Nokia's mobile device business, with the deal closing on 25 April 2014. As a result, the Lumia line's maintenance was transferred to Microsoft Mobile. As part of the transition, Microsoft continued to use the Nokia brand on Lumia devices until October 2014, when it began to officially phase out the Nokia name in its promotion and production of smartphones in favor of Microsoft branding. [3] In November 2014, Microsoft announced the first Microsoft (non-Nokia) branded Lumia device, the Lumia 535. [4] In October 2015, Microsoft announced the first Lumia devices running on Windows 10 Mobile , the Lumia 950 , Lumia 950 XL and Lumia 550. [5] [6] [7] The most recent Lumia smartphone, the Lumia 650 , was announced by Microsoft on 15 February 2016. Sales decreased sharply after the introduction of Windows 10 in 2015 and Microsoft briefly stopped selling Lumia devices from the Microsoft Store at the end of 2016 [9] —by which time sales were estimated to have dropped below one million units [10] —although availability was restored at the beginning of 2017. [11] [12] In October 2017, Microsoft's corporate vice president, Joe Belfiore , confirmed that Microsoft will no longer sell or manufacture new Windows 10 Mobile devices. The existing devices will receive bug fixes and security updates only. 1.1 Partnership between Microsoft and Nokia. 1.2 Acquisition of Nokia's mobile phone business. 1.3 Under Microsoft ownership. 3 List of Lumia devices. 3.2 Nokia-branded Lumia devices. 3.3 Microsoft-branded Lumia devices. 4 Comparison of Lumia smartphones. From 1998 to 2012, Nokia was the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world, which included early smartphones built on its Symbian platform. However, in recent years, its market share declined as a result of the growing use of touchscreen smartphones from other vendors, such as Apple 's iPhone line and Android -based products. In 2010, its market share had declined to 28%, and in April 2012, Samsung Electronics (a prominent user of Android) ultimately overtook Nokia as the largest mobile phone vendor in the world. Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop vetoed the idea of producing Android devices, believing the company wouldn't be able to suitably differentiate its Android products from that of other vendors. [14] [15] In an employee memo, Elop infamously described the company as being on a "burning platform", blaming the "war of ecosystems " between iOS and Android as part of Nokia's overall struggle, and asserting that the company needed to make major changes to its operation. See also: Windows Phone §. The Nokia Lumia logo, used prior to the post-acquisition rebranding by Microsoft. Nokia Lumia 800 , the first Lumia device. In February 2011, Stephen Elop and Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer jointly announced a major business partnership between Nokia and Microsoft, which would see Nokia adopt Windows Phone as its primary platform on future smartphones, replacing both Symbian and MeeGo. The deal also included the integration of Bing as the search engine on Nokia devices, and the integration of Nokia Maps into Microsoft's own mapping services. [16] Nokia had planned to use the MeeGo platform as part of its future plans prior to the announcement, although the company announced that it would still release one MeeGo device in 2011. [16] [18] [19] Aligning with Microsoft had been considered a possibility by analysts due to Elop's prior employment with the company. Nokia unveiled its first Windows Phone 7 -based devices, the mid-range Lumia 710 and high-end Lumia 800 , on 26 October 2011 at its Nokia World conference. [21] [22] Motivated by requests from the U.S. carrier AT&T for an LTE -enabled device, Nokia quickly developed the Lumia 900 as a follow-up, first unveiled at the 2012 International CES. The Lumia 900 received heavy promotion by the carrier as a flagship device , but its launch was dampened by a software bug that prevented the device from connecting to certain mobile data networks, forcing AT&T to issue credits to those who purchased the device. Upon its launch in April 2012, the Lumia 900 was listed as a top seller on Amazon.com , but online sales began to taper off by May. While not revealing further details, a Nokia representative stated that the company was "pleased with the consumer reaction, as well as the support we have received from AT&T", while AT&T's mobility chief Ralph de la Vega stated that the Lumia 900 had "exceeded expectations". In early 2012, Nokia released the Lumia 610 , a new entry-level device taking advantage of the lower system requirements introduced by Windows Phone 7's "Tango" update. These new low-end devices were intended to improve Windows Phone adoption in emerging markets such as China. [24] [25] [26] Later in September 2012, Nokia unveiled the Lumia 820 and the Lumia 920 , its first two devices to use the second generation of the Windows Phone platform, Windows Phone 8. [27] Both featured NFC , with the Lumia 820 embedding a microSD card slot, and an optional Wireless Charging Shell for Qi wireless charging. The Lumia 920 also notably featured Qi wireless charging, and a " PureView " camera with optical image stabilization. While Nokia received criticism when it was revealed that a demonstration video of its image stabilization technology was, in fact, filmed using a professional camera, the Lumia 920 was a commercial success for the company. At MWC 2013, Nokia introduced two more Windows Phone 8 devices: the mid-range Nokia Lumia 720 and the budget Nokia Lumia 520 , the latter of which has become the highest selling Windows phone device ever. [29] In 2013, Nokia also introduced the Lumia 925 , a revised version of the 920 with a slimmer build incorporating aluminium, [30] and the Lumia 1020 , which features a 41-megapixel camera based on technology from its Symbian-based 808 PureView. [31] On 22 October 2013, Nokia extended the Lumia brand into the tablet market with the unveiling of the Lumia 2520 ; running Microsoft's Windows RT operating system, it was the company's first tablet since the Nokia Internet tablet range. [32] Some critics believed that the usage of Windows RT rather than full Microsoft Windows 8.1 led to bad sales, as most major Windows tablet makers have used Windows 8.1 in favour of Windows RT. [33] [34] Alternatively, others have claimed that the device's failure was due to its heavy weight and high price. [35] [36] Lumia 2520 was discontinued in early 2015. Although sales of the Lumia line had exceeded those of BlackBerry in the same period, Nokia still made an operating loss of €115m, with revenues falling 24% to €5.7bn following the second quarter of 2013. Over the past nine quarters [ when? ] , Nokia sustained €4.1. See also: Microsoft Mobile §. 2013 to 2014: Acquisition of Nokia's mobile phone business. On 3 September 2013, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Nokia's mobile phone business (including rights to the Lumia and low-end Asha brands) in an overall deal of over US $7bn. Stephen Elop stepped down as Nokia's CEO and returned to Microsoft as its head of devices as part of the deal, which closed in early 2014. [41] While Microsoft will license the Nokia name under a 10-year agreement, the company will only be able to use it on feature phones : those running the Series 30 , Series 30+ [42] and the Series 40 mobile operating systems based on Java ME and MediaTek technology, [43] respectively. [44] [45] These changes resulted in future Lumia models being first-party hardware produced by Microsoft. See also: Nokia X family and Nokia X platform. On 13 September 2013, the New York Times writer Nick Wingfield revealed that Nokia had been testing the Android operating system on its Lumia hardware. [48] It was one of two known Android projects at the company; the other was running the OS on low–end Asha hardware, which resulted in the Nokia X family of devices. Despite the testing, the Android-based Lumia handsets were never released and only altered Asha devices were brought to the market. In July 2014, Microsoft announced that it would discontinue the majority of its Nokia-branded devices, including the Asha, S30, S40, and X platforms, in favor of low-cost Lumia devices inheriting their design. [52] This left S30+ as Microsoft's only remaining Nokia-branded phone platform until it was sold to HMD Global in May 2016, [53] who, the following February, would announce the first Nokia-branded true Android phone, the Nokia 6 , in January 2017. Microsoft Lumia 535 , the first Microsoft branded Lumia device. Even after the acquisition of Nokia's mobile device business by Microsoft, several Lumia devices were unveiled by Microsoft Mobile in September 2014 that still carried the Nokia name, including the Lumia 830 and Lumia 735. [55] In July 2014, it had been reported by evleaks that Microsoft was attempting to license the Nokia name in a co-branding scheme, which would have possibly seen future devices branded as "Nokia by Microsoft". [56] [57] [58] As a part of the change of ownership, the social network pages have also been rebranded as Microsoft Lumia [59] [60] rather than Microsoft Mobile; this sought to emphasize the Windows Phone over other Nokia mobile phones while also updating social network pages of Windows Phone to the new Microsoft Lumia branding. [61] To reflect this change, Nokia Conversations was also rebranded as Lumia Conversations , [62] and NokNok.tv to Lumia Conversations UK. [63] However, the rebranding has not been consistent, as the Nokia Army was renamed the Spartan Nation and the support site for legacy phones, accessories, various Nokia-branded devices, and services, originally Nokia Discussions, was renamed the Microsoft Mobile Community. [64] The Lumia Beamer was the last Lumia-branded application to have its URL changed from Nokia to Lumia, signifying the end of the transitional term during which Microsoft was allowed to use Nokia.com and related sites. However, in October 2014, Microsoft officially announced that it would phase out the Nokia brand in its promotion and production of Lumia smartphones, and that future Lumia models would be branded solely with the name and logo of Microsoft. [3] [66] [67] [68] In November 2014, Microsoft announced its first self-branded phone, Microsoft Lumia 535. [4] [69] [70] Rebranding the Lumia line did not affect sales, though some critics believed that it might negatively influence consumers' decisions due to Nokia's established reputation for durability compared to the relative infancy of Microsoft's brand in the consumer phone space. [71] [72] The Nokia Lumia 638 was the last Lumia product to bear the Nokia brand, and was only released in India in December 2014.. In November 2014, a post by a Microsoft Twitter account stated that all Nokia and Microsoft Lumia smartphones running Windows Phone 8 and 8.1 would receive updates to Windows 10 ; however, following the official unveiling, Microsoft denied this, stating that they instead were targeting the "majority" of Lumia phones and that not all phones would receive the update or support all of its features. [73] Later, Microsoft confirmed that low-end devices with 512. MB of RAM (including the Nokia Lumia 520 , which represents 24.5% of all Windows Phone devices sold), [74] would also get the Windows 10 upgrade, but reaffirmed that not all of its features would be supported on these devices. [75] [76] Additionally, Microsoft stated on January 16, 2015 that low-end Windows Phone 8.1 phones will not get some Lumia Denim features. In July 2015, Bloomberg reported that Microsoft had a planned restructuring of Microsoft Mobile, which includes the Microsoft Lumia range. This would reportedly include a write down of approximately US$7.6 billion on the acquisition of Nokia's mobile phone business and a layoff of around 7,200 employees. It was also reported that Microsoft would release fewer first-party devices each year. [78] As part of a larger restructuring, the Microsoft Devices & Studios engineering group was merged with the Operating Systems Engineering Group to form the larger Windows & Devices Engineering Group. In July 2015, it was announced that the head of Surface , Panos Panay, would head the new Microsoft devices unit, which would include the Microsoft Lumia as well as various other Microsoft hardware products such as the Band , HoloLens , and Xbox. In October 2015, Microsoft launched the first Lumia devices running on Windows 10 Mobile : the Lumia 950 , Lumia 950 XL and Lumia 550. [5] [6] [7] In February 2016, the Lumia 650 , which also runs Windows 10 Mobile, was launched. [80] Sales of Lumia devices declined between fiscal years 2015 and 2016, with phone revenue decreasing by $4.2 billion or 56%. When Microsoft announced the acquisition in September 2013, 7.3 million devices were sold in the quarter, but this shrunk to 1.2 million at the quarter ending June 2016. [81] Since the Lumia series make up 95% of total Windows Phone/Windows 10 Mobile sales, the operating system market share also shrunk along with it. [82] Throughout 2016 Microsoft slowed down production volumes of Lumia devices, and it was speculated that the series would be discontinued by the end of 2016. CEO Satya Nadella said in November 2016 that the company is working on the "ultimate mobile device". [84] The device was unofficially dubbed by journalists as the " Surface phone", and there were rumours of a late 2017 launch. Shortly after the discontinuation of the Elite X3 , [86] HP's attempt to bring Windows 10 Mobile to a niche market, Microsoft's corporate vice president Joe Belfiore confirmed that Microsoft will no longer sell or manufacture new mobile devices. The existing devices will receive bug fixes and security updates only. See also: Windows Phone version history. Nokia and Microsoft Mobile have released several updates unique to Lumia devices which feature a combination of firmware and software updates. The latter of these includes imaging improvements, new technology support, feature updates, and bug fixes. Because Lumia devices exclusively use Windows Phone, major operating system updates are often bundled with the firmware updates upon release.. Similar to how Windows Phones receive operating system updates , Lumia update releases are dependent on carriers who decide if and when devices are to receive them. [87] However, operating system updates are not subject to these constraints if users are part of Microsoft's Windows Insider or Preview for Developers programs.. 000000002013-08-15-0000 August 15, 2013 [89].

Under Nokia, numbers larger than 10 indicated a phablet (e.g. 1320 , 1520 ) or tablet ( 2520 ). Since the sale of the Lumia line to Microsoft, four-digit model numbers have been discontinued, with larger models instead being denoted by an "XL" suffix (e.g. The second digit indicates the generation of the device, based on the operating system it originally shipped with:. The third digit is used to distinguish between variants in the same family and generation. 0 indicates the base model, while other numbers indicate either a minor upgrade (e.g. 920 and 925 ), a 4G-capable variant (e.g. 730 and 735 ) or a regional or carrier-specific variant..

Microsoft Lumia 540 Dual SIM Review: Affordable Style With a Few Caveats. Jamshed Avari , 04 June 2015. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Microsoft's takeover of Nokia's handset business has had the immediate effect of speeding up the refresh rate of Lumia hardware. There more models in the portfolio than ever before and the gaps between launches have shrunk considerably. It makes sense for most of these models to be clustered around lower end of the market since flagship new hardware will be on hold till Windows 10 is launched later this year.. The proliferation of models means that customers have far more choices at far more price points. Android dominates the budget market, and for good reason - it is now possible to get tremendous value out of sub-Rs. 10,000 Android smartphones in terms of speed, features, camera capabilities and construction quality. That means Microsoft has a major challenge on its hands, and we're happy to see that it's taking things seriously.. Look and feel Smartphones these days tend to all look alike, and not many manage to really stand out. The Lumia 540 Dual SIM is one of those few, thanks to its highly unusual translucent rear shell. The unit we got for review was a very attractive electric blue with a slightly darker band around the sides reminiscent of the "dual-shot" layer effect on previous models. The phone is also available in orange or white with the same effect, and matte black for those who would prefer something plainer.. Overall, this doesn't look like a budget-segment phone. The material and construction quality are outstanding. The front face is a stealthy black thanks to the use of on-screen buttons. The volume and power buttons are on the right, the Micro-USB port is on the bottom and the headset socket is on top. The camera lens is flush with the rear. The only thing we didn't like about the design was Microsoft's ugly black logotype down the centre of the rear.. There isn't much wasted space around the screen, which helps you hold and use it with one hand. The Lumia 540 Dual SIM is light enough that it won't cause fatigue, but you might feel its corners digging into your palm. We were concerned that the high-gloss rear would pick up scratches but that didn't happen in our time with it. On the other hand, we had to keep wiping smudges and fingerprints off.. The shell needs a little more effort than usual to come off. You'll see a microSD card slot to the side of the camera module, but the two Micro-SIM slots on the edge of the battery compartment which means taking the battery out each time you need to change them.. Microsoft includes a charger with a fixed USB cable in the box, so you'll need your own for data transfers. This cost-cutting move is especially annoying because the phone itself doesn't feel like any cutbacks were made. There's also headset which is fine for voice calls and okay for music.. Specifications and software The Microsoft Lumia 540 Dual SIM is defined by its 5-inch 720x1280-pixel screen. This has become fairly standard for budget phones and we have no complaints. The screen is sharp and bright, with decent viewing angles even under direct sunlight.. The processor is a low-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 with four cores running at 1.2GHz. The 1GB of RAM and 8GB of built-in storage solidify this phone's budget-level positioning. You get Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 and A-GPS. The removable battery seems beefy enough, with a 2,200mAh rating.. The rear camera has an 8-megapixel sensor and the one in front is a surprisingly decent 5-megapixel unit. For some reason entirely beyond our understanding, video capture through the rear camera has been capped at 848x480, which is just a wider version of 640x480 VGA. There's no reason for such a bizarre restriction especially because Lumia phones have so far been associated with high-quality camera capabilities.. The Lumia 540 Dual SIM comes with Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2 and its promo material clearly states that it will be eligible for an update to Windows 10 upon that version's release later this year. Microsoft has stuffed it to the gills with its own apps, including Skype, Office and OneDrive; all the Windows apps, such as News, Food & Drink, Health & Fitness, Money and Travel; and a whole bunch of apps passed down from Nokia, such as Lumia Camera, Lumia Selfie, Lumia Storyteller, MixRadio and Here Maps. If those weren't enough, there are quite a few third-party ones as well: Ola Cabs, PayTM, BBM, Cleartrip, Facebook, Twitter, Gaana, Foodpanda, Snapdeal and more.. As always, we like several of the Windows Phone platform's software features, such as the Sense apps which help you get on to Wi-Fi networks and manage storage; Cortana, the voice assistant; and independent dialler and messaging shortcuts for each SIM. Windows Phone continues to stand out from Android and it will take some getting used to if you're new to it.. Performance While not a speed demon, we found the Lumia 540 Dual SIM adequate for everyday usage. Some apps, such as the camera, did take a few seconds too long to load and some transitions and animations stuttered slightly on occasion. These things took away from the usually slick Windows Phone experience.. Benchmark scores were pretty much at par with those of the Microsoft Lumia 532 Dual SIM ( Review | Pictures ) which we tested not too long ago. The two have similar core specifications so this wasn't surprising. We observed timings of 1259.1ms in SunSpider and 27307.7ms in Mozilla Kraken. AnTuTu for Windows Phone gave us a score of 11,654, while the WPBench result was 227.29.. The battery life was decent, at 8 hours, 41 minutes in our video loop test - interestingly, this phone lasted just a little less than the Lumia 532 Dual SIM did despite having a larger battery. We put this down to the different screens the two models have. Call quality was great, and we had no trouble with 3G network reception.. Video playback was iffy, with several of our test files refusing to play or stuttering badly. The phone had trouble with 720p files in any format other than AVI, which was surprising. Audio quality was excellent though, with clear, rich reproduction but not always enough volume.. We were very pleased with the camera. The app was slow to load but focusing was quick and easy. Shots taken in daylight came out crisp and clear, with vibrant colours and very little loss of detail even in distant objects. The camera also dealt well with areas in the shade, and we happy with how colours and textures came out. Even at night, the camera handled things accurately. Focusing was slow and objects in motion came out blurry more often than not, but noise was always under control and colours were well defined. Exposures were handled well even in frames with a bright source of light and other areas in the shadows. The front-facing camera wasn't as impressive but should do for casual shots and video chatting.. Pro mode in the Lumia Camera app lets you play with white balance, manual focus, ISO, shutter speed and exposure compensation. The great sensor and optics make it all the more disappointing that Microsoft hobbled this phone's video recording capabilities.. Verdict The new Microsoft Lumia Dual SIM feels like a definite step up from the Lumia 532 Dual SIM in terms of its appearance and display. It just feels better to hold and use, and yes, even to show off. Internally the two are much the same and so you aren't getting any major performance benefits even though the price is about 50 percent higher.. Even so, most people would choose the Lumia 540 Dual-SIM when shown both options side by side. If money isn't your primary concern, you'll definitely feel better about owning this phone rather than its predecessor.. With that said, we still aren't happy with some of Microsoft's choices. Android phones such as the Xiaomi Redmi 2 ( Review | Pictures ), Motorola Moto E (Gen 2) ( Review | Pictures ) and Lenovo A6000 Plus ( Review | Pictures ) sell for less and offer better capabilities such as at least 720p video recording. While none of them might have the Lumia 540 Dual SIM's style, you'd be less likely to feel buyers' remorse after a few months.. Pick up the Lumia 540 Dual SIM if you value style above all else and want to stand out in a crowd. If utility is your main concern but you still want Windows Phone, save some money with the Lumia 532 Dual SIM. If you want better features and a bit more power, you have plenty of options on the Android side of the fence..

Mobiles / Microsoft Mobile Phones / Microsoft Lumia 540 Dual SIM Price in India. User Visits: 2 Launch Date in India: 18 May, 2015 Compare. Microsoft Lumia 540 Dual SIM Description. No 4G LTE Non removable battery. he Lumia range of smartphones has not lost a step even though Microsoft took over Nokia's mobile division some time ago. You can understand it this way that Lumia smartphones are generating more buzz than they used to when Nokia made them. Now that Windows 10 for Phones (earlier Windows Phone OS from Windows Phone 7.5 OS to Windows Phone 8.1 OS) is just a few months away, the buzz around Lumia smartphones is just going to increase a lot. So, the new Lumia smartphone named Lumia 540 has been observed in that light as well as its current situation of running Windows Phone 8.1 OS.. Microsoft Lumia 540 comes with the trademark Lumia design with a chunky bar form factor and polycarbonate make. The brand is offering the handset with the same bright colour options as it has done in the past.. Coming to the display of the handset, Lumia 540 comes with a decent 5-inch display that can be considered ideal for multimedia. The display of the handset offers a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels for an HD viewing experience.. The user experience offered by the handset is exemplified by the live tiles on homescreen and the easy to access app drawer provided by Windows 8.1 with Denim update. The handset is also slated to receive the latest Windows 10 update from its manufacturer.. Microsoft has equipped the Lumia 540 with a Quad-core processor that boasts of a clock speed of 1.2 GHz. Moreover, the processor of the handset is equipped with a RAM of 1 GB , which is good enough for a Windows phone. The rear panel of the handset houses a battery unit with a strength of 2200 mAh, which might see through a day's worth of usage on a full charge.. For photography enthusiasts, Microsoft has equipped the rear panel of the device with an 8 MP. primary camera with an LED flash. The front panel of the handset also houses a 5 Megapixels snapper for those who like to capture selfies.. On the connectivity front, the dual SIM handset missed out on 4G LTE , however, it comes with supports with 3G , which may note be faster than 4G though offers impressive speeds. Other connectivity options on the handset include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, microUSB and GPS.. The Lumia 540 seems to be prepared for any and every competition it has to face in the market. While Windows Phone 8.1 OS did not receive the welcome it was supposed to (for all issues that it threw at users, such fate is not unwarranted), with Windows 10, it should be able to hold its own and upstage many of its competitors too. The entire formula of a Lumia smartphone is intact, the only thing left to resolve is OS and Microsoft will start seeing the good old days of popularity and critical acclaim..

Microsoft Lumia 540 Dual SIM Review. Author Sandeep Sarma Posted on June 12, 2015 July 20, 2015 Categories Featured , India , Microsoft , Reviews , Windows. No HD Video Recording (Maximum Resolution for Video is 480p at 30fps). Average Camera (Bad Low Light Performance and High Colour Noise). Above Average Battery Life (Lesser compared to the Lumia 640). "Microsoft Lumia 540 Dual SIM Review" , 1 out of 5 based on 17 ratings.. Microsoft launched the Lumia 540 Dual SIM last month in India. It is a handset that makes you confused as to what its purpose in Microsoft’s lineup really is. This is because it closely resembles its elder brother, the Lumia 640 which was announced alongside the Lumia 640 XL at MWC in Spain earlier this year.. On paper, the two handsets are neck and neck in terms of specifications and the only difference you can spot easily is the inferior Snapdragon 200 processor used on the 540 while the 640 gets a Snapdragon 400 processor. Let us dig deeper and see if there is more to it than meets the eye and whether there is enough difference between the two models to justify releasing a whole another model. If so let us see how it performs as well. If you haven’t read our Lumia 640 review , probably you should check out that as well after reading this review.. The Lumia 540 has a size that is very similar to the Lumia 640 as both the devices pack the same 5 inch display. 144 x 73.7 x 8.6 mm while the 640 is marginally smaller at. 141.3 x 72.2 x 8.8 mm. Yes, there is a difference in thickness and although it is just 0.2mm thinner, it does feel much easier to hold in the hand. Especially because the edges of the back cover are much more curved than the 640. The weight of the devices are 152 grams and 145 grams for the Lumia 540 and 640 respectively.. Above the display, you have the earpiece, front facing camera, ambient light sensor and proximity sensor.. Below the display, you have just the primary microphone as the navigation keys are on screen.. At the top, you have the 3.5mm audio jack and at the bottom, there is the microUSB port.. The left side is empty but the right side houses the volume rocker key as well as the power/lock button.. Both the buttons provide good tactile feedback and are easy to locate and press.. At the back, you have the 8 Megapixel camera unit with LED flash. There is a Microsoft branding at the centre and a loudspeaker at the bottom. The back cover is one of the main changes compared to the Lumia 640. The White, Orange and Cyan variants get a Dual Gloss finish which looks quite pleasing. The Cyan and Orange variants especially have a fluorescent finish that gives a nice glow under certain lighting conditions. Despite being glossy, scratches do not appear easily and there is no shortage of grip. The only downside of the glossy finish is that it attracts fingerprints really easily. If you do prefer a Matte finish, then you can go for the Black version which offers a similar look and feel to the Lumia 640 black matte variant that we reviewed. Another good thing is that you can change the back cover if needed as it is still removable.. Removing the back cover gives you access to the battery as well as SIM compartments and the microSD card slot. The battery itself is removable as well and you need to take it out in order to access the microSIM card slots. The microSD card slot however supports hot-swapping and can be changed without removing the battery.. Overall the device feels quite good in the hands and we prefer its handling over the Lumia 640 and despite being a fingerprint magnet, we found the dual-gloss finishes to be quite appealing.. The display remains the same as the Lumia 640. Both the devices have a 5 inch 720p IPS display with ClearBlack technology. Due to the slightly larger bezels, the Lumia 540 has a smaller screen to body ratio compared to the 640. However being devices in the lower end of the price segment, we don’t really see many device with bragging rights over the screen to body ratio. So the Lumia 540 isn’t at. What is missing from the Lumia 540 is the Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection which was available on the 640. Instead the 540 makes do with toughened glass.. The screen attracts fingerprints quite easily too but feels good to use. It is quite smooth and responsive. The brightness levels are very good and thanks to the good contrast ratios, you don’t really need to bump up the brightness much especially indoors. The device performs well under sunlight as well just like the Lumia 640. The resolution is good enough for a screen of this size and we didn’t really notice any deficit in terms of sharpness or have any issues with reading text or viewing images. The colours come out quite well too and Microsoft even gives the user the ability to adjust colour temperature according to his/her preference.. Double tap to wake works well like on the 640. bit feebler than the one on the 640 but still good enough. You can also change the brightness levels at each setting of Low, Medium and High. The screen rotation is well implemented in terms of sensing the phones orientation but we found that the phone was quite slow in switching between the modes and the transition while doing so made it seem even slower. The phone can also improve sunlight readability and also can be set to automatically reduce screen brightness when in battery saver mode.. The dialer is large and easy to see and use. You can easily choose which of the two sims you want to use before making the call. The people app is the contacts app and shows you the names of your contacts along with thumbnails of photos you’ve assigned to each.. Since the dialer app and contacts app remains unchanged, we’ve included screens from the Lumia 640 itself.. The built-in call filter allows you to block certain numbers of your choice and/or block numbers that have been withheld. You can choose to have notifications of these blocked calls or messages and even have a live tile if you want. All the intercepted calls and messages will appear in the call filter for your reference.. The Lumia 540 carries on the tradition of producing smartphones with very good call quality.. The earpiece is loud and clear and the person on the other end of the line can easily be heard even in the noisiest of environments. Similarly the noise cancelling works well and your speech is also audible clearly to the other party. The loudspeaker also performs well as it’s loud and clear. The phones ringtone volumes are loud too but the vibration is a bit feebler than on the Lumia 640.. microSIM cards but only has support for 3G, no 4G LTE but that is no surprise especially considering that neither the 640 nor the 640 XL had support for it either.. The built-in keyboard is quite comfortable to use and easy to get used to. Even with my large fingers, I didn’t make too many mistakes or typos once I got used to the layout. Swipe or trace inputs are also supported and works well especially when you can’t really use both your hands. The only downside is that we wish they would’ve included. number shortcuts as well instead of having it in a second page to make use of the screen estate.. The phone supports Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n. It has micro USB 2.0 and Bluetooth 4.0. The phone packs 8GB of internal memory and despite packing 2 microSIM slots, you’ll be delighted to know that Microsoft have included a microSD card slot as well. Cards up to 128GB are supported however due to the device’s performance we are not quite sure how well it will handle cards of such large capacities. Out of 8GB of built-in memory, the user gets around 3.88GB of free space at his/her disposal.. The Lumia 540 comes pre-loaded with. Windows Phone 8.1 (Lumia Denim) out of the box. Microsoft has promised that the device will get an upgrade to Windows 10 as and when it releases. The phone is powered by a Snapdragon 200 processor and has 1GB of RAM. The phone performs without hanging and we never had the phone reboot or crash on us while testing. Despite being powered by an inferior processor, we hardly noticed any lag while navigating through the UI like what we noticed on the Lumia 640. That is quite surprising especially considering the 640 has a more powerful processor. Perhaps like we said earlier it is just something that needs tweaking on the software side and perhaps an update for the 640 will fix the issue in the future. Switching between apps did show a bit of lag on the 540 but nothing as apparent as what the 640 had. So the 540 does quite well here in our book.. The lockscreen is quite nice and you can assign different apps to show their updates and notifications on the lockscreen. In our case we quite loved how the Weather app displayed on the lockscreen. It keeps changing its background based on the weather conditions in your location. The homescreen is a colourful affair. You can choose to have tiles in a particular colour against a white or black backdrop. You can adjust the size of the tiles and also use live tiles for the apps that support them. You can assign a background image which will get overlayed on supporting tiles.. The notification drawer is another welcome addition to Windows 8.1. The quick toggles are customizable and you can have a maximum of 4 quick toggles at a time. There is also a shortcut to the settings from there.. The glance screen is a neat feature that shows the notifications and time even when the device is on standby. You can choose from peek where the glance screen works for 30 seconds after locking your device and disappears after. You can also choose for it to appear for a short duration at regular intervals or also to stay on all the time. You can also choose whether to hide the notifications and also different modes for the glance screen while the device is being charged. You can choose to turn off glance screen all together as well if you wish. In our experience the glance screen doesn’t really affect the battery life much and is a feature we found to be quite useful. We didn’t notice the device getting hot during our usage of the device, at worst maybe it got a bit warm.. The camera on the Lumia 540 is identical to the one on the 640. Both the devices have an 8 Megapixel camera with LED flash. The camera like on the 640 is quite capable in well-lit situations. The detailing is quite good and so is the white balancing. The colours are quite neutral and has good dynamic range. The only downside is that there is a bit of purple fringing in the photos and some noise creeps in but not something you would realize much unless you zoom in and look carefully. The output should look good on most social channels that you want to share with but don’t expect to be taking great quality prints with it. However we noticed that the image quality is slightly inferior to the 640 as there is a bit more of noise in every situation. Noise is high especially in the low light shots and that is where the weakness of the camera lies. Apart from the noise, the shutter lag also makes it difficult to take a blur free photo.. You can click on the samples below to view the full resolution images.. The camera can only record videos at 30 fps at a maximum resolution of 480p due to the limitations on the processors part. So don’t expect to be using your camera to record much video unless it is for the occasional Dubsmash or Instagram types.. Surprisingly the front facing camera receives a big upgrade over the Lumia 640 as the 540 has a 5 Megapixel unit compared to the 0.9 Megapixel unit on the 640. The detailing is much better and along with the Lumia Selfie app, you can easily apply a bunch of filters and tweak the images easily to upload to your social networks. The front camera can even match the rear camera in terms of video recording capabilities as it too can record 480p videos at 30 fps. It also doesn’t have much of the colour fringing and noise issues that was present on the Lumia 640 front camera.. The Lumia camera app is the same as the one on the Lumia 640. You get quite a lot of detailed controls such as ISO, exposure, white balance etc. It allows you to tweak and get the best out of the camera. You can choose between 16:9 or 4:3 ratios. You can even capture moving images (cinemagraphs). You can choose from a wide range of framing grids to help assist you in composing the photo including rule of thirds, golden ratio or square to help you with your Instagram purpose photos.. You even have options for bracketing the photos if you wish to create manual HDR photos. Holding down the shutter button triggers the burst mode or the video mode based on the option you choose. The Lumia Selfie app and the refocus app are neat additions to the Lumia camera. You can also download other lenses from the app store to get different types of effects for your photos.. The Lumia 540 has pretty good quality like the 640 however its strengths lie in different area. The Lumia 640 had a loud-speaker which got muffled the moment you placed it on a flat surface. The 540 has a reasonably loud-speaker but doesn’t get muffled when placed on a flat surface despite being at the back of the device. But instead manages to channel the sound and amplify it a bit. This could be due to the more curved back design of the Lumia 540 compared to the 640. Also the 640 speaker was placed towards the right side while the 540 speaker is centrally aligned. at the center towards the bottom. There isn’t much distortion even at higher volume levels.. The audio quality through headphones/earphones is quite good too but the details are often overpowered by the bass which seems too artificial at times. There is a bit of cross-talk and noise but only at the highest levels. As it has a 3.5mm audio jack, you can use just about any earphone/headphone that’s available in the market.. The bundled earphone isn’t very good and you’re better off getting 3rd party earphones/headphones that can make better use of the phones audio capabilities.. The music player supports MP3s, AAC, WMA and WAV files. You can sort your tracks according to artists, albums, songs, genres and playlists. If you have an XBox Music account, you can link the music player to that. There aren’t any fancy settings or equalizer here. You get the Rewind/Previous, Play/Pause and Forward/Next buttons along with Album art and the song timeline through which you can seek the tracks. It also supports shuffle and repeat.. The Lumia 540 Dual SIM achieved a One Charge rating of 12 hrs 59 mins. The battery life on the Lumia 540 isn’t as good as the one on the Lumia 640. It will last a day for an average user but a power user will have trouble getting through the day. We will be conducting our battery tests and give you the one charge rating soon. When it is complete, we will update this section of the review so do check back in a few days for it.. The Lumia 540 Dual SIM is a good phone overall.. It has a few shortcomings especially with video recording limited to 480p resolution. But it has more of positives than negatives and that is a good thing. But we aren’t sure if we will pick it over the Lumia 640 especially considering that the price difference between the two is almost negligible after the price cuts. The dual-gloss design of the Lumia 540 however does make it stand out more amongst the crowd and the much improved selfie camera is a bonus too. So if those are two things that you want in your phone then perhaps the Lumia 540 should be your choice over the Lumia 640. However if you are fine with Android devices as well then perhaps you should research more as there are devices out there that offer more bang for the buck. If you are looking for a Windows smartphone though then the fight is between the 540 and the 640 and what you get should be based on what you need as both the smartphones offer very similar experiences yet are clearly different. The Lumia 540 Dual SIM was launched at a price of Rs 10,199 however you can find it for around Rs 9,100 on some sites.. Sandeep Sarma is a blogger and a freelance photographer.

Front one is 5 megapixels..n4) Battery life is good (I am an average user)n5) Most of the required applications are available in the Microsoft storen6) Tiles looks cool, able to adjust/changing them is interestingn7) Sleek design and pretty handy. Sturdy build quality which you can experience from the time you lay your hands on it.n8) Windows 10 update ready nnCons:n1) No notification light ! No glance screen on this model either :(n2) No Mozilla Firefox support for Windows yet, need to get happy with IE or UC browser.n3) Standard apps (like Whatsapp) updates are coming late for Windowsn4) No data cable (which feels cheap). Headphones quality needs to be improved. n5) Seeing a minor lag/freeze after disconnecting every call. This needs to be fixed.nnOverall: Satisfied with the product.

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 8 GB + MicroSD. View all photos (5). Based on 1 User reviews. Too little RAM memory (1 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (294 ppi). The Nokia Lumia 540 Dual SIM comes with a 5" display that has a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels, making up for a pixel density of 294ppi, while a quad-core Snapdragon 200 is humming inside the phone at 1.2GHz. The SoC is paired with 1GB of RAM and has 8 gigs of native storage from the get-go. You also get a microSD card slot and up to 30GB of cloud-based storage with Microsoft's OneDrive. The Lumia 540 Dual SIM is equipped with an 8MP rear camera that comes with a LED flash and auto focus, while the front-facing shooter is a 5MP wide-angle one. The battery powering this Windows Phone trooper is a removable 2,200mAh one. Speaking of Windows Phone, the Lumia 540 is running on Windows Phone 8.1 with most recent update Lumia Denim update.. Dimensions: 5.67 x 2.90 x 0.37 inches (144 x 73.7 x 9.4 mm). Weight: 5.36 oz (152 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI). Software Features: Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Resolution, 848 x 480 pixels 30 fps. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 26.20 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min).
