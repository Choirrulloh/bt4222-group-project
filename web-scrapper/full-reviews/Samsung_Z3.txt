more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 8 GB + MicroSD. View all photos (15). Does not support automatic screen brightness. Too little RAM memory (1 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (294 ppi). Samsung Z3 is endowed with a 5" Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 720 by 1,280 pixels. Peeking inside the phone will tell us that it comes with a quad-core Spreadtrum chip, has 1GB of RAM, and 8GB of native storage. Worry not, Samsung has also thrown in a microSD card slot. Pictures can be taken with an 8MP rear camera, while selfie lovers will make use of a 5MP, 120-degree front-facing shooter. Below the curved rear, we find a 2,600mAh battery.. Dimensions: 5.57 x 2.76 x 0.31 inches (141.6 x 70 x 7.9 mm). Weight: 4.83 oz (137 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus, CMOS image sensor. Software Features: Face detection, Geo tagging. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 15.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Ten months after the introduction of Z1, Samsung held a surprise global launch of its successor, the Z3 smartphone on Wednesday in India. The pocket-friendly device aims to make a mark in the low-end segment with a price tag of Rs. The Korean tech giant also took the opportunity to announce the Samsung Z3 as a 'Made in India' smartphone. It will go on sale next week via offline retail channels as well as Snapdeal.. For those familiar with the previous two Tizen smartphones, the Samsung Z and Samsung Z1 , the Z3 doesn't represent any significant change in the lineup. Samsung continues to use the plastic polycarbonate build profile we've seen in many Galaxy smartphones over the years. It screams typical Samsung design from every angle even though there's a new home button on the front and the front-facing camera and sensors are placed differently.. The Z3 has a flat oval-shaped home button as seen in almost all the Galaxy devices, instead of the square one that the Z1 had. The screen is now a lot bigger as well, at 5 inches. The volume buttons are on the left, power button on the right, and the back panel stays nearly unchanged as well. The new model, however, is definitely slimmer than the Z1 by almost 2mm and gives a good grip. It's available in Black, Silver and Gold.. The Z3 of course comes with upgraded innards. The device sports all the specifications seen in a typical low-end smartphone: 5-inch HD (720x1280-pixel) resolution display; 1.3GHz quad-core Spreadtrum SC7730S SoC coupled with 1GB of RAM; 8GB of built-in storage that's expandable via microSD card (up to 128GB); 8-megapixel rear camera with LED flash; 5-megapixel front-facing camera, and a replaceable 2600mAh battery. While these are an upgrade over its predecessor, the demo handset at the event still lagged at few places while multitasking, and heated up slightly when we played Asphalt Nitro for 10-15 minutes.. The Z3 has two Micro-SIM slots and is the company's first to run Tizen 2.4. This new version of the OS is not much different from Tizen 2.3, which the Z1 shipped with. For Android users, the UI will feel very basic and simple, something which Samsung says is important. It has a static interface with circular app icons. All the usual options can be found under 'Settings' and the notification tray features a single scrollable row of quick toggles for Bluetooth, torch, Wi-Fi and other functions. Users can change the handset theme or customise it via the 'Styler' option.. Samsung's My Galaxy app service and MixRadio app took centrestage at the event. The MixRadio app will give Samsung Z3 users access to 30 million songs free for life. It has an 'intelligent' RECO engine that can recommend songs based on users' preferences. The company also unveiled the My Galaxy app, which will be available for Samsung devices via Google Play and the Tizen Store. The app provides deals, discounts, and device care services in four categories: Home, Services, Care, and My Page. Home shows offers and deals (from partners such as Pizza Hut, Paytm, Amazon, Bookmyshow, and Coupon Dunia); Services shows options for recharges, food, and travel; Care helps users locate Samsung stores and service centres, as well as services including the Samsung Smart Tutor; and finally My Page shows saved favourite offers, payback points which can be redeemed via Samsung Stores, and more. Both MixRadio and My Galaxy can be uninstalled.. The Super Amoled display is vibrant and shows deep saturated colour tones. At 5 inches diagonally, it is also easy to reach all corners with one thumb. In our limited time with the device, we were not able to fully test the processor capabilities, but as stated above, we observed lags after opening five apps. Switching between two apps was also not smooth. Although on paper the Z3 features 1GB of RAM, quite a lot will be consumed by the operating system. As for the storage, only 4.9GB is available for media storage and apps. However, the device supports up to 128GB of expandable storage.. We did not have very high expectations of the Z3's camera. The image quality was average, as seen with other budget smartphones. The 8-megapixel rear camera with f/2.2 aperture shoots HD resolution video, which again was not all that impressive. A VGA (480x640 pixel) resolution option for video recording is also available. The 5-megapixel front-facing camera however delivers decent shots. The camera app features Auto, Pro, Panorama, Beauty Face, Dream Shot, HDR, Night, and Continuous Shot modes. A double-tap on the home screen fires up the camera application quickly. We still need to run tests on the smartphone to determine how long its 2600mAh battery will last on each charge.. Based on our time with this device at its launch event, the Samsung Z3 seems to be just another low-cost smartphone, except without the benefit of Android. It falls behind when compared to the Yu Yunique , Lenovo A7000 , Motorola Moto G (Gen 2) , or Asus Zenfone 2 Laser, all of which are sub Rs. Tizen is still taking baby steps in the mobile OS market space. The Z3 also doesn't offer 4G, which is becoming increasingly common at this price level. It will be interesting to see how Samsung plans to position and sell the Z3 given these challenges. Stay tuned for our full review..

Samsung is a brand that has been on top of its game in smartphone segment for a while now and is revered by its fan.

Back in January, Samsung launched its first Tizen-powered smartphone, the Z1.. rumors that the Z1 encountered a. during its first month of availability, Samsung managed to sell 1 million units. Now, Samsung’s finally unveiled the next Tizen phone, the Z3. Here are all the specs and the availability for it.. As expected, the Samsung Z3 isn’t a high-spec phone like the Android-based Galaxy S6. It’s a mid-range phone with very reasonable specs fro its sub-$200 price tag. The Z3 sports a 5-inch HD Super AMOLED screen with a 720p resolution, and it’s powered by a 1.3GHz quad-core processor along with 1GB of RAM. Although it’s only got 8GB of internal storage built in, Samsung equipped the phone with a MicroSD card slot, which allows you to add an extra 128GB of space when you run out of room for all your pics and videos.. The 2,600mAh battery should keep the Z3 running for a full day or more, especially with that lower resolution screen. Ultra Data Saving Mode is available to save your phone from dying in areas where the cell signal is poor. The mode essentially compresses data by as much as 40 percent, so the phone doesn’t lose power. Another Ultra Power Saving Mode takes even more extreme measures to save your battery. It more or less disables phone functions that are not absolutely essential.. Rounding out the specs are an 8-megapixel rear camera and 5-megapixel front camera, both of which sport an f/2.2 aperture. Unfortunately, there’s no support for 4G LTE, so the Z3 is somewhat limited in terms of connectivity. However, since it’s for the Indian smartphone market, the lack of 4G might be less critical.. Samsung offers the Z3 in a few color options, including black, gold, and silver. 8,490, which amounts to $130, and those in India who are interested in using a Tizen phone can get one at Indian retailer Snapdeal later in October.

Tizen and the mobile software distributions it is related to. In 2010 Samsung was developing the Samsung Linux Platform (SLP) for the LiMo Foundation, whilst Intel and Nokia were leading the MeeGo project, another open source Linux mobile OS. [4] In 2011 the MeeGo project was abandoned by its peers with Intel joining forces with Samsung to create Tizen, a new project based on code from SLP. The Linux Foundation also cancelled support of MeeGo in favor of Tizen. In 2013 Samsung merged its homegrown Bada project into Tizen. The Tizen Association was formed to guide the industry role of Tizen, including requirements gathering, identifying and facilitating service models, and overall industry marketing and education. [6] Members of the Tizen Association represent major sectors of the mobility industry. Current members include: Fujitsu , Huawei , Intel , KT , NEC Casio , NTT DoCoMo , Orange , Panasonic , Samsung , SK Telecom , Sprint and Vodafone. On May 7, 2012, American wireless carrier Sprint Nextel (now Sprint Corporation) announced it had agreed to become part of the Tizen Association and planned to include Tizen-powered devices in their future lineup. On September 16, 2012, the Automotive Grade Linux Workgroup announced it will work with the Tizen project as the reference distribution optimized for a broad set of automotive applications such as instrumentation cluster and in-vehicle-infotainment (IVI). On May 14, 2014, it was announced that Tizen:Common would ship with Qt integrated. [10] This marks the ability for Tizen to support Qt native apps.. Samsung announced in November 2016 that they would be collaborating with Microsoft to bring .Net support to Tizen. Samsung is currently the only Tizen member developing and using the operating system.. As of 2017 Tizen is second largest smartwatch platform, behind watchOS and ahead of Android Wear. On January 1, 2012, the LiMo Foundation was renamed Tizen Association. The Tizen Association works closely with the Linux Foundation , which supports the Tizen open source project. The first Tizen tablet was shipped by Systena in October 2013. Part of a development kit exclusive to Japan, it was a 10-inch quad-core ARM with 1920×1200 resolution [17] [18] [19]. On February 21, 2016, Samsung announced the Samsung Connect Auto, a connected car solution offering diagnostic, Wi-Fi , and other car-connected services. The device plugs directly into the OBD-II port underneath the steering wheel. On April 3, 2017, Vice reported on its "Motherboard" website that Amihai Neiderman, an Israeli security expert, has found more than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities in Tizen's code, allowing hackers to remotely access a wide variety of current Samsung products running Tizen, such as Smart TVs and mobile phones. [21] Only after the article was published did Samsung, whom Neiderman tried to contact months before, reach out to him to follow up on the report. ^ "Tizen UI Overview". ^ "Tizen 3/0 SDK Release Notes". ^ "Tizen Target Market".

Samsung still believes in its Tizen OS, which it is prepping up to play a big role in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The Samsung Z1, being an entry level phone with Samsung branding sold very well, and now Samsung Z3 will continue its legacy. At the launch, the lowest price of Samsung Z3 in India is 8,499 INR, but there are good chances of price being slashed further. The Samsung Z3 comes with a 5-inch (1280 × 720 pixels) HD Super AMOLED display. Samsung proved with Galaxy J5 and J7 that it can make decent AMOLED panels, even on a budget and we don’t expect Z3 to disappoint in this regards. It is also the cheapest phone to offer an AMOLED display in India for now. The processor employed is 1.3 GHz quad-core Spreadtrum processor, aided with 1GB RAM and 8GB internal memory. If it were an Android phone we would have written off the chipset based on our prior experience, but we are yet to see how well Tizen OS 2.4 is optimized. The phone also includes decent camera for the budget. Imaging hardware includes 8MP rear camera with LED Flash, f/2.2 aperture lens paired with 5MP front-facing camera with 120-degree wide angle selfie mode and f/2.2 aperture lens. A 2600 mAh power unit housed inside looks above average too. If Samsung wants to increase share of Tizen running phones, it is mandatory that it provides great experience at budget price. On paper, Samsung Z3 seems like a good option for basic users who value Samsung branding. Samsung Z3 Snapdeal Price is 8,490 INR. For now you can only buy Samsung Z3 online in India. Samsung might later extend its availability to offline stores as well. Let's try and answer some frequently asked questions. Question – How is the display on Z3?. Answer – The display is perhaps the best part of Samsung Z3. An AMOLED panel, benefiting from years of Samsung AMOLED expertise, for an under 10k price is definitely alluring. There are several software modes to tweak display colors and saturation. Question – How is the outdoor visibility on Z3 ?. Answer – Like other budget phones, Samsung relies on Outdoor mode, which you have to manually select from notification shade, to enhance sunlight legibility. Question – Has Samsung provided Auto-Brightness feature in Z3?. Answer – No, Auto Brightness is still missing. Question – How is the design and build?. Answer- The Z3 screams Samsung from every angle. The handset is more rectangular than other Samsung budget use, but design ethos and material used (soft faux leather plastic back and chrome finished plastic side edges) are pretty much on the expected lines. It looks good for a budget phone with tier 1 branding. Question – Are Capacitive keys backlit?. Answer – No, Capacitive keys are not backlit. Question – What kind of SIM card does it accept? How is the call quality on Z3?. Answer – It accepst 2 MicroSIM card slots. Call quality is average, signal strength was good. Question – How much internal storage space is free? Can Apps be moved to SD card on Z3?. Answer – out of 8GB around 4.9 GB is available on first boot. You can move apps to SD card. Question – Is USB OTG supported?. Answer – Yes, USB OTG is supported. Question – How is the Z3 performance?. Answer – The Tizen OS is quite light and runs well even on modest budget hardware. There aren’t many apps to test how much beating it can take, but hardware is good enough for day to day usage and light gaming. Questions – Are there any heating issues in Z3?. Answer – We didn’t observe any heating issue on Z3. Question – How much RAM is free on first boot?. Answer- Out of 1GB, around 700MB RAM is free on first boot. Tizen is very efficient with RAM consumption. Question- How is the Samsung Z3 camera?. Answer – Camera is a below average affair. Camera performance was a hit or miss irrespective of the ambient lighting and it would be wise to not expect too much here. Question – How is the Battery backup on Samsung Z3?. Answer – Battery backup is very good. You can easily go beyond one day with moderate to heavy usage. Question – Is the battery removable on Z3?. Answer – Yes, battery is user replaceable. Question – How is the software?. Answer – Tizen is light and efficient, but lack of apps in the app store is a problem here. Developers aren’t very enthusiastic about developing apps for the nascent platform, and several apps which work on Z1 are yet to be optimized for Z3. Google apps and services are not supported on Samsung Z1. Question – How loud is the loudspeaker on Sony Z3 Dual?. Answer – Loudspeaker loudness is average. Question – What comes inside the box of Z3?. Answer – you will get 1A charger, data cable, head phones and documentation bundled with the box. Samsung Z3 is a very basic phone meant for the most basic of users. Lack of Google services and apps might also be a deal-breaker for those already invested in Android ecosystem. The handset is targeting first time users switching from feature phones who need to engage only with basic usage.. Sharp AMOLED display panel Juicy Battery Decent design.
