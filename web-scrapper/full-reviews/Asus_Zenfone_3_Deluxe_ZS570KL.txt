And one thing If your phone needs repair it takes lots of time to fix it, between three to eight months. Therefore if you buy it don't count on support team.. I do had both zenfone 3 5.2 inch and zenfone 3 deluxe 5.7 inch. Both takes pretty good lowlight but zenfone 3 some kind of lower noise than zenfone 3 deluxe. Both have 4K video recording and both have detailed 4K video but much noise in lowlight..

ASUS ZenFone 3 Deluxe (ZS570KL): Pricing and Specs in the Philippines. It looks amazing, it's the ZenFone 3 Deluxe, ASUS' new flagship.. Following the ASUS Zenvolution event in the country earlier this month, ASUS' new crop of ZenFones have hit the market, and the most impressive of all of them is the ASUS ZenFone 3 Deluxe. This ultra-high-end phablet splashes onto the local smartphone market with a deafening explosion, with some otherworldly specifications and a flagship-level price.. The ZenFone 3 Deluxe has a 5.7-inch Full HD 1080p Super AMOLED display protected by scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass 4. Inside is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset with the dual 2.15Ghz and 1.6Ghz dual-core Kyro processors. It's backed by a whopping 6GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage with an option of microSD expansion, a 23-megapixel main camera with laser autofocus, phase detection autofocus, optical image stabilization and dual-LED flash, and an 8-megapixel front camera to top it off.. It has the usual LTE Cat.6 connectivity with WiFi a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2, A-GPS, a fingerprint sensor, a 3,000mAh battery with QuickCharge 3.0, and the usual accelerometer, proximity sensor, light sensor, gyroscope, compass, and barometer. It also has USB Type-C and supports dual SIM.. There are almost no side bezels to speak of, and the lower bezel has a spun-metal finish, while the rear plate is sand-blasted for a fine metallic finish. Even more impressive, the entire phone chassis is solid unibody metal, without any antenna lines to break the contours.. The phone pretty much checks off all the features you'd expect from a flagship level device, and the price reflects it: the ZenFone 3 comes in at a respectable PHP34,995. Even without taking the phone for a test drive, it's easy to see how the phone favorably matches up to other flagship smartphones out there like Samsung's S7 or LG's G5.. While it remains to be seen whether ASUS' ZenFone line will have the legs to compete in the high-end of the smartphone market, the Taiwanese company has at least broken out of the cheap plastic designs that marred the otherwise impressive ZenFone 2 range. Whether the increase in cost will factor in ASUS' ability to gain market share is another matter that will play out over the next few months.. Read more news on this product.

My previous phone was Xperia Z3 Compact.. This one is big, and it pokes out from my chest pocket.. It has high-end feel, and works lightly.

Therefore if you buy it don't count on support team.. am, 25 Jan 2018 hi asus user..asus zenfone 3 ZE552KL vs. asus zenfone 3 deluxe ZS570KL..which one more better ... more I do had both zenfone 3 5.2 inch and zenfone 3 deluxe 5.7 inch. Both takes pretty good lowlight but zenfone 3 some kind of lower noise than zenfone 3 deluxe. Both have 4K video recording and both have detailed 4K video but much noise in lowlight.. hi asus user..asus zenfone 3 ZE552KL vs. asus zenfone 3 deluxe ZS570KL..which one more better for low light camera and recording 4k video? someone pls advice me. that's not true I have used this Asus phone and it's really good, just because you had a bad experience doesn't mean you should discourage others who are having a good one.. Asus becoming bad now a days. My phone take 1 month to repair. Now problem with mic board and home and recent apps button. Purchased in Nov '16, received 12/28/16. By April I experienced several issues with the phone rebooting continually and not able to turn on. Somehow through a factory reset, was able to limp through until August when I had same experience. ASUS Cust service told me the speaker was bad and so they couldn't repair phone until I paid $122. I paid although the speaker was not bad that I was aware of and I needed my phone. I was sent a photo which could not be identified as my phone. ASUS supposedly replaced the battery and the mother board, basically did a complete rebuild or so I was told. I was guaranteed the repairs would be covered for 90 days. Experiencing same issues plus screen went black and was inoperable. Send phone back to ASUS repair. Today I receive an invoice for a FPC Cable, Back Cover and LCD for $251. I am sent a picture of an unidentifiable phone with a slight crack in the LCD screen. It was not that way when it left here and the packaging arrived undamaged. I am not sure how I could damage an FPC cable which is an internal part but ASUS customer service seems to assert that. I cannot recommend this product for these reasons and for the poor warranty support/coverage of this phone.. Please note that this phone (and all ASUS phones) does NOT have MIRROR link compatability!. kooi, 18 Oct 2017 Is that this phone will heat up high, when during talk time or when using gps?

Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe ZS570KL Smartphone Review. Andreas Kilian ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 02/21/2017. ARM Smartphone Touchscreen Android Phablet. Asus' latest ZenFone 3 Deluxe flagship smartphone will also be available on the European market soon. With Qualcomm's current premium SoC, a high-resolution 23-megapixel camera, and a large 5.7-inch AMOLED panel, the handset features some technological highlights.

For the original German review, see here .. in May 2016 and has been available in Asia for about. It was the first device based on a. at the time of its debut there. Today there are many competitive devices that are also equipped with this premium-range processor. Now, the smartphone is officially being launched in Europe. Its configuration makes it obvious that it is a flagship: Our review sample comes with a generous 128 GB of UFS 2.0 flash memory and 6 GB of RAM. The especially high-resolution 23-megapixel primary camera and a large 5.7-inch AMOLED panel are further features. The ZenFone 3 Deluxe will be available in Glacier Silver and Sand Gold at a starting price of 799 Euros (~$840).. The high-price and the incorporated high-end technology only allow using the premium models of competing manufacturers for comparison. Among them, we find the Android smartphones. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge , the. Lenovo Moto Z and the. However, the review sample also has to compete against the compact. Non-Android rivals fighting for the smartphone crown are found in.

Asus is particularly proud of the ZenFone 3 Deluxe's aluminum casing that is not - as in most rivals - interrupted by antenna strips. They are only visible as three matte points in the milled edge around the front, covered by Gorilla Glass 4. The silver color of our review sample looks like champagne depending on the light angle. With a width of 156.4 millimeters (~6.2 in) and length of 77.4 millimeters (~3 in), it is not much bigger than. with a 5.5-inch screen, despite its 5.7-inch panel. scores with even more screen surface with similar dimensions. The review sample's maximum height of 7.7 millimeters (~0.3 in) corresponds roughly to Asus specifications (4.2 to 7.5 millimeters/~0.17 to ~0.3 in). The camera lens protrudes by approximately one millimeter (~0.04 in) and thus the smartphone rocks a little when placed on a table. Asus' minimum specification of 4.2 millimeters (~0.17 in) only applies to the outermost area between both glossy diamond cut edges and is thus not significant for everyday handling. With a weight of 161 grams (~5.7 oz), our review sample is even 11 grams (~0.4 oz) lighter than stated in the specification sheet. Furthermore, the handset gives the impression that it has been made of one piece: The smartphone absolutely defies twisting attempts and moderate pressure on both the front and the back.. The build quality does not leave much room for complaint either. All edges have been impeccably smooth, the materials feel high-quality, and the gaps between the different parts are narrow. Only the lateral buttons clatter somewhat when touched lightly. Apart from the removable card tray on the casing's left, there are no maintenance options and the user cannot replace the battery easily..

However, the operating system and preloaded applications occupy a large part of the latter, and the user ultimately has only 109 GB available. It is possible to insert a microSD card with the current maximum capacity of 256 GB that should provide more storage should it be needed (theoretically up to 2 TB). It cannot be formatted as internal storage and thus apps cannot be installed on it. Furthermore, this blocks the dual-SIM function since the microSD card slot shares the space with the second SIM slot.. A reversible USB Type-C is installed for recharging the battery and sharing data. While the ZenFone 3 Deluxe supposedly supports USB 3.0 according to some specification sheets, only 2.0 speeds were possible with our review sample. Although a USB 2.0 cable is included, no more than 35 MB/s could be transferred even with a USB 3.0 cable. It is nice that USB OTG is supported, which allows. direct attachment of peripherals and flash drives or keyboards. Furthermore, the ZenFone 3 Deluxe supports video output via DLNA and Miracast. Wi-Fi Direct, NFC, and Bluetooth 4.2 are available for wireless data sharing. An FM radio is also installed.. An Always-On display and the notification LED allow the user to see information at a glance. However, the latter only lights up in orange and green. Lower edge: Microphone, USB Type-C port, speaker. Asus covers Android version 6.0.1 with its adapted user interface ZenUI 3.0. It is not known when or if an update to Android 7, which has already been available for a few months, will follow. Asus had started to deliver the corresponding update for the smaller. Asus also lags behind with security patches: Our review sample's was dated October 2016 - buyers could expect better support especially for a top model.. ZenUI 3.0 comes with a variety of functions - among them a theme engine that allows adapting the user interface's appearance extensively and quickly. Furthermore, a "Basic" and a "Kid's" mode that limit the smartphone's functions accordingly are installed. 50 items are found in the app drawer ex-factory; among them third-party apps from Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Puffin, and TripAdvisor. Only the latter two can be uninstalled completely.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

The ZenFone 3 Deluxe supports dual-SIM (1x nano-SIM, 1x micro-SIM). However, the second SIM slot is a hybrid slot that will possibly be occupied by a microSD card. All German mobile network frequencies are supported. Data transmission is possible at up to 600 MBit/s (download) and 100 MBit/s (upload) in the LTE network. However, only the SIM card set up for the data service can dial into them.. The ZenFone 3 Deluxe transmits in the latest Wi-Fi ac standard, and is also equipped with MIMO technology. Thus, gross data speeds of up to 867 MBit/s are possible. However, the connection with our Linksys EA8500 router recurrently was interrupted in the 5 GHz network and we could only perform reliable tests in the 2.4 GHz frequency band. With real transmission rates of 75.5 MBit/s in send and 70.4 MBit/s in receive, the ZenFone 3 Deluxe cannot keep up with other premium-range devices that we tested in the 5 GHz band. Furthermore, we noticed that the 5 GHz Wi-Fi range was not as good as with many other high-end rivals..

The ZenFone 3 Deluxe located our position with an accuracy of 3 meters (~10 ft) without significant delays outdoors. The GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou satellite networks are supported. Qualcomm's lZat location service can also be enabled optionally.. As usual, we took the review sample alongside Garmin's Edge 500 GPS system on a bike ride and logged the results. The smartphone does a relatively good job: The outcome of the total route recorded with both devices deviates by less than 2%, making the ZenFone 3 Deluxe quite suitable as a navigation system. In detail - for example, the crossing at the bridge just before the turning point in the west - most smartphones tend to take shortcuts.. Garmin Edge 500 - Turning point.

Asus does not use the standard Android phone software. Instead, a proprietary app is installed. It offers the standard features, such as a call list, keypad and direct access to the contact database. In addition, it can be fitted with a dark skin, a different background, and individual fonts to meet personal preferences.. The ZenFone 3 Deluxe convinces with good intelligibility and effective noise suppression during normal calls. However, a moderate background noise could occasionally be heard during the test. The strong speaker ensures decent clarity, even in hands-free mode, but recurrent short interruptions are heard on the contactâs side. The included headset also makes a useful impression: Both sides understand each other impeccably, and again, a slight noise is present only on the contact's side.. Primary camera photo (click for original). The primary camera in the ZenFone 3 Deluxe has an aperture of f/2.0, optical image stabilizer and a high resolution of 23 megapixels. A laser and phase detection autofocus are used for focusing the picture as fast as possible. In practical use, this intricate system still functioned reliably to a large degree, even under difficult conditions. As our sample photos show (scene 1 & 2), lots of details could be captured with the high-resolution sensor in bright ambient light. However, a slight blurriness can be seen in the outer corners. Furthermore, some image areas present a certain graininess that becomes even more evident in poor light conditions. Smartphones with a lower resolution sensor are often superior to our review sample in low light situations. Asus has a trick up its sleeve, though: This shortcoming is hidden well via a special low-light mode that halves the photo's resolution horizontally and vertically. The opposite is the case in the super-resolution mode: Here, several photos are combined into one photo with twice the horizontal and vertical resolution of the automatic mode. This equates to a high 90.3 megapixels, even though Asus states 92 megapixels. In fact, landscape photos shot in this mode display a few more details. Overall, Asus has installed a primary camera suitable for the premium range. Its strength lies primarily in its high resolution under ideal conditions.. The smartphone's front-facing webcam has an 84-degree wide-angle lens with an aperture of f/2.2 and a resolution of 8 megapixels. This component does not give much reason for complaint: Relatively high-detail selfies can be taken in both good and bad light conditions - although inherently its resolution is lower than that of the primary camera.. The primary camera records videos with a maximum resolution of 3840x2160 pixels at 30 FPS. Videos at 60 frames per second are possible in Full HD quality. It is rather too bad that autofocus is disabled, and thus the touchscreen has to be used for changing the plane of focus. The front-facing camera records Full HD videos that are astonishingly focused for a selfie camera.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. We compare a photo of X-Rite's ColorChecker Passport taken under defined light conditions with the factual reference colors to evaluate the color accuracy of the primary camera in the ZenFone 3 Deluxe. The photo is not edited afterward, e.g. It is very obvious that the smartphone displays all colors more strongly and much brighter than they actually are. The latter is also true in the grayscale levels, but fortunately, here a color tint is not visible.. We test the sensor's resolution and reproduction performance by photographing our test chart under defined light conditions. The loss of sharpness at the edges and a visible graininess due to artifacts becomes even more apparent here than in the sample photos.. Original colors are displayed in the lower half of each patch.. Asus delivers the ZenFone 3 Deluxe in a high-quality, stable box. It contains the smartphone, an 18-watt charger (5V, 2A or 9V, 2A), a USB 2.0 cable, an in-ear headset and a quick start guide. is optionally available in black and beige for 49.99 EUR (~$53).. Asus includes a 12-month warranty on the smartphone. legal warranty period of two years. via the retailer applies within the EU.. Gorilla Glass 4 protects the 5.7-inch touchscreen and allows accurate inputting. Quick typing on the proprietary ZenUI keyboard is possible. The keyboard also offers swipe input, makes word suggestions, and the user can customize its size and appearance.. The Android navigation buttons are implemented as backlit touch buttons below the screen in the ZenFone 3 Deluxe. They are very sensitive to the touch and their positioning saves valuable space on the screen compared with on-screen solutions. The smartphone generally responds stutter-free and without delays thanks to its high-end hardware.. It is also possible to use various touch gestures; among them, double-tap to wake and double-tap to sleep, as well as opening apps directly from standby. A finger has to draw a predefined letter on the disabled screen for this.. Obviously, a fingerprint scanner should not be missing in a top model. It is on the smartphone's back and is relatively small. It usually does its job without issues, but not quite as fast as the category leaders. The fingerprint is sometimes identified incorrectly.. Asus has installed a 5.7-inch Super AMOLED panel with diamond matrix into the ZenFone 3 Deluxe. According to the manufacturer, it only needs an. A specification of 1.3 millimeters (~0.05 in) is stated. However, we measured approximately 3.3 millimeters (~0.13 in) between the active screen surface and the outermost edge - not a bad rate, but not outstanding either.. With a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels and a pixel density of 386 PPI, the smartphone does not stand out positively in today's high-end sector - many competitors already use higher resolution QHD panels. phablet has slightly less to offer here. Nevertheless, individual pixels can hardly be seen away from VR applications. When looking closer, light color fringing can be seen at the edges on single-colored surfaces.. The ZenFone 3 Deluxe achieves an average maximum brightness of 468 cd/mÂ² with the ambient light sensor on a completely white surface. It even climbs up to 619 cd/mÂ² when dark and bright areas are distributed evenly over the screen (average picture level / APL 50). On the other hand, a maximum of only 334 cd/mÂ² is possible when adjusting the screen's brightness manually. These rates place the review sample roughly on par with. Lenovo's Moto Z , but overall, cannot quite reach the level of. Furthermore, the screen's illumination of 85% is not as homogeneous as in most rivals, even though this is not visible in practice. The black level is 0 cd/mÂ² thanks to the underlying AMOLED panel technology, and thus high contrasts are achieved.. 463 cd/m² 470 cd/m² 509 cd/m² 452 cd/m² 464 cd/m² 493 cd/m² 432 cd/m² 448 cd/m² 485 cd/m². 85 % Center on Battery: 619. cd/m²) ΔE Color 3.2 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 1.4 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.27.

Like virtually all AMOLED panels, the ZenFone 3 Deluxe uses PWM technology for controlling the brightness. The amplitude of switching cycles increases the darker the screen's brightness is set. It operates at a frequency of 235.8 Hz, which can cause eye problems or perception of screen flickering in sensitive users.. Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM detected 235.8 Hz. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. The display backlight flickers at 235.8. Hz is relatively low, so sensitive users will likely notice flickering and experience eyestrain at the stated brightness setting and below.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display.

This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. The screen's color reproduction can be adapted via the app "Splendid". Asus sets the color profile to "Super Color" ex-factory. It delivers rich, cool colors and seems to be geared to the AdobeRGB color space. The setting "Standard" is aimed more at the more common sRGB color space and reduces the color saturation visibly. Nevertheless, the color temperature of 7518 K remains clearly over the ideal rate of 6500 K. We could reduce the color temperature to almost ideal 6590 K by pushing the corresponding slider in "Super Color" mode. At the same time, the DeltaE rates also dropped to 3.2 (colors) and 1.4 (grayscale).. Grayscale (Super Color, target color space: sRGB). ColorChecker (Super Color, target color space: sRGB).

As typical for AMOLED, the viewing angle stability is very good. The brightness loss when looking at the screen from flat angles is kept within tight limits, and colors do not invert. Light color fogging is only visible from an almost lateral angle.. SoC is inside the ZenFone 3 Deluxe. Two of the quad-core's high-performance Kyro cores clock at a maximum of 2.4 GHz, while the other two clock at a maximum of 1.6 GHz.

The scores in the browser tests are mixed: While only the exceptionally powerful. once again defeats the ZenFone 3 Deluxe in the Mozilla Kraken benchmark, it comes in last in the WebXPRT 2015 test. The Octane V2 and JetStream 1.1 scores are enough for the midfield.. However, considering that the top models of every manufacturer are competing against each other, the performance of the ZenFone 3 Deluxe is very high on its own.

Asus has equipped the ZenFone 3 Deluxe with 128 GB of fast UFS 2.0 storage. It achieves a high performance especially in sequential write (163.05 MB/s) and random read (100.87 MB/s) that only the Moto Z can outperform. The outcomes in sequential read and random write are only enough for the midfield in the comparison group.. Accessing our Exceria Pro M401 (THN-M401S0640E2, UHS-I Class 3, max. write: 80 MB/s) was performed at 77.77 MB/s in read and 59.04 MB/s were possible in write. Although the memory card's potential is not quite exhausted, the ZenFone scores extremely well compared with the competition, especially in write..

We measured an average of 59 frames per second in " Dead Trigger 2 ", while " Asphalt 8 " reached very high 30 FPS in both very low and high graphics settings - the latter indicates a frame rate limitation of the game. However, micro-stutters were recurrently observed when tapping the Nitro button in " Asphalt 8 " despite the review sample's high performance. As we did not detect this behavior in any of the other apps, we presume that the game had a bug.. The large touchscreen and internal sensors functioned impeccably in gaming mode. However, the speaker on the side could be covered depending on the hands' positioning.. The idle surface temperatures of roughly 28 Â°C (~82 Â°F) on the ZenFone 3 Deluxe are inconspicuous. The entire smartphone heats up moderately during load, and a maximum of only 40.9 Â°C (~106 Â°F) is reached. Although this feels slightly warmer due to the metal casing, it is uncritical for the inner components.. We use the battery test of GFXBench that performs the demanding Manhattan test thirty times in succession to examine whether this outcome involves performance losses. Here, it becomes obvious that it makes quite a difference whether one follows Asus' recommendation to enable the performance mode in the energy-savings settings or not. The SoC's performance decreases from the top rate by 18% after 8 runs and remains at this level. However, when the performance mode is selected, the loss of almost 7% is much lower..

Asus states that it has installed a. that is especially strong into the ZenFone 3 Deluxe. However, our Pink Noise assessment is not particularly high at a maximum of 78.9 dB(A). Nevertheless, the subjective sound when playing music is loud enough to fill small rooms with sufficient sound and without significant distortions. The handset sounds relatively thin as typical for smartphones, which is illustrated by the Pink Noise frequency curve: It drops audibly toward both the trebles and low tones. Thus, the speaker should be sufficient for many users in everyday use, but it cannot quite compete with the best sound solutions in the mobile sector.. The metal finish of the included 3.5-mm jack looks attractive, but music sounds very bass-heavy and muffled ex-factory. Fortunately, the preloaded audio assistant provides an equalizer and, with a few tweaks, a more balanced sound impression can be achieved.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 31.6 40.3 25 25.4 35.4 31 25.3 33.6 40 32.9 29.8 50 33.6 34.8 63 31.6 33.2 80 28.4 30 100 27 31 125 20.8 25.6 160 22 33.2 200 21.3 38.7 250 20.8 43.4 315 21.2 52.3 400 19.4 57.3 500 19.5 60 630 17.7 63.9 800 17.9 70.4 1000 17.8 73.4 1250 17.3 69.6 1600 17.4 64.1 2000 16.7 64.1 2500 17.2 64.6 3150 18.2 71.4 4000 17.9 64.4 5000 17.6 56.6 6300 17.7 53.1 8000 17.8 57.7 10000 17.9 50.7 12500 18.1 45.6 16000 18.2 47.3 SPL 30 78.9 N 1.3 39.8 median 17.9 Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe ZS570KL median 57.3 Delta 1.3 9.4 40.6 32.9 32.4 40.6 41.6 29.8 31.3 41.6 34.5 32.1 31.7 34.5 38.1 40.9 26 38.1 34.4 37.8 39.4 34.4 25.6 27.8 36.2 25.6 29.7 27.9 28.6 29.7 33.1 27.5 25.4 33.1 34.9 24.8 21.3 34.9 41.3 20.6 23.3 41.3 45 26.1 22.5 45 52.5 31.3 22.4 52.5 57.8 37.8 21.3 57.8 59.6 39.9 18.4 59.6 63.4 45.4 17.5 63.4 69.9 50.8 17.5 69.9 71.5 53.1 17.2 71.5 72.2 55.2 16.8 72.2 74.7 57.8 17.3 74.7 74.9 57.7 17.4 74.9 77.9 59.4 16.6 77.9 80.3 61.8 17.3 80.3 80.7 60.8 17.6 80.7 76.1 54.7 17.6 76.1 75.9 54.6 17.7 75.9 79.7 60.5 17.4 79.7 73.3 54.3 17.7 73.3 67.8 49.7 17.9 67.8 66.8 47.7 18.1 66.8 58.1 33.5 18.1 58.1 88.7 69.7 29.8 88.7 73.8 23.1 1.3 73.8 median 69.9 Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge median 50.8 median 17.7 median 69.9 9.9 11.7 1.6 9.9 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

In review: Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe (ZS570KL). Review sample courtesy of Asus Germany. Already the feel of Asus' ZenFone 3 Deluxe is pleasing when held for the first time, thanks to its high-quality and particularly solid metal casing. This conceals a 128 GB UFS 2.0 storage and generous 6 GB of RAM besides the Snapdragon, and thus the smartphone is quite capable of competing with other high-end devices from 2016 in terms of performance. The connectivity with a USB Type-C port, optional Always-On display and a dual-SIM/microSD hybrid slot, among other things, is also appropriate. Both high-resolution cameras can reap in bonus points. Furthermore, the primary camera benefits from an especially fast autofocus system. However, it has some room for improvement, particularly in low-light situations and the often grainy picture texture. The high-resolution AMOLED panel's size of 5.7 inches is big, but the handset is only partially suitable for VR applications due to the Full HD resolution. Asus' modified ZenUI 3.0 user interface offers various extra functions - but not every user will like the fact that 19 GB of the admittedly relatively generous storage capacity is reserved. Furthermore, some rivals offer considerably longer battery life.. Users who do not need virtual reality capabilities and like the extensively modified user interface will find a high-quality premium-range smartphone with only a few real shortcomings in Asus' ZenFone 3 Deluxe.. However, it is debatable whether the review sample has enough highlights to justify the current starting price of 799 Euros (~$840), especially when compared to the now falling prices of the rivals. It cannot serve with a curved edge like. or with the modular extensions of. It does not have the iconic status of. and its Android is not updated as quickly as Google's. And users looking for as big a screen as possible will find a bigger screen with roughly the same external dimensions in. Nevertheless, the ZenFone 3 Deluxe is an interesting alternative that will find friends in the premium smartphone range, thanks to its solid technology, dual-SIM functionality and the successful design..

Images of the Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe (ZS570KL) – Pick and Click Your Color Below For Images. The Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe is the most premium offering available of the entire Zenfone series. Asus has pushed their design, hardware and pricing into new territory with this smartphone.. Looking back since its release, the Zenfone 3 Deluxe exceeded expectations. It started at a pre launch Asus investors conference where Jerry Shen, Asus CEO, mentioned some uncertainty on Zenfone 3 Deluxe sales because it would be higher priced that any other smartphone that they had release previously. As it turned out, the most talked about and most anticipated model was in fact the Zenfone 3 Deluxe.. To the surprise and delight of Asus, the ultra premium Zenfone 3 Deluxe Special Edition which has the almighty Snapdragon 821 processor and 256GB storage was capturing a lot of praise and excitement from the tech world. Certainly a high price didn’t scare anyone away which was a surprise to the Asus executives. It also meant that initial demand outweighed the supply.. Now that it’s mid 2017, supply issues are not an issue and you will find the Zenfone 3 Deluxe in stock at your typical retailers. Additionally you may actually start to see slight sale prices in the coming weeks and months.. So the message to Asus is that consumers actually want the fastest smartphones on the planet. That may not be the case for every market, but certainly there are more people wanting to spend their money on the cutting edge hardware than Asus expected.. With this being the most premium Zenfone 3 offering, it has pretty much everything you want or need short of having an exchangeable battery or stylus support. It’s more expensive that the other Zenfone 3 Series phones so I’m here to tell you whether this model is worth the extra money.. Zenfone 3 Deluxe (ZS570KL) Specs Overview:. The Zenfone 3 Deluxe comes in either gold or silver. My model is the silver version although the two colors are strikingly similar.. If smartphones are like cars, then consider the Zenfone 3 Deluxe a luxury car. A luxury car has that special look to it. It’s unlike most every other car on the road. Similarly, the look of the Zenfone 3 Deluxe stands above most every other smartphone out there.. This phone can only be fully appreciated when you can see it in person and hold it in your hands. Until you have it in your hands you simply won’t appreciate it quite as much. Trust me when I say I’ve seen a lot of images and video of the Zenfone 3 Deluxe but they can only tell half the story. When I unboxed this smartphone I understood the price, why they called it “Deluxe”, and why it has won so many design awards.. Asus has done an incredible job from the Zenfone 2 series to the Zenfone 3 series in term of design and looks. The base model Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL/ZE520KL) is a beautiful looking phone in its own right. That glass covered body is elegant! However the Zenfone 3 Deluxe brings with it a different premium look. It’s a look of metal, brushed aluminum. It has a clean back without antenna lines etched into the rear. It’s simply as clean as you can get. There is no goofy shape going on here like the wedge of the Google Pixel XL. There are no clashing textures on the rear of the phone like the Google Pixel XL. There are no lines running edge to edge on the rear of the Zenfone 3 Deluxe like the almighty Apple iPhone. It doesn’t have the unconventional curved glass edges like the Samsung Galaxy Edge design.. The Zenfone 3 Deluxe does not have a flat back. Rather, Asus has employed a slight convex or canoe like shape which allows it to fit even better in your hand. This curvature is a winner and makes sense from a usability and functionality perspective. I sure hope that it’s a design that Asus employs for their next generation Zenfone 4 series.. Asus has chosen to put the finger print sensor on the rear of the phone. From a practical perspective I’m not a big fan of this placement but it is super fast to unlock the phone. The rear placement of the finger print sensor simply means that when the phone is on the table you need to either swipe and enter a PIN code (in my case) or I need to pick up the phone in order to use the finger print sensor. Sure life is so tough right? This is obviously a minor quibble and not a deal breaker. However in real terms I couldn’t use the finger print sensor as much as I wanted to simply because of the location.. On the front of the Zenfone 3 Deluxe, Asus has the typical three capacitive buttons. Unlike the other Zenfone 3 models the Zenfone 3 Deluxe capacitive buttons are backlit. In theory the backlight should help you find the button but the light doesn’t activate until you touch on one of the buttons. Lighting up after the fact serves little purpose. If this is your first Android device don’t worry because after a short time you will know where the “back” button is and where the “recent apps” button is. If you are so inclined, you can in fact have the back light on all the time by getting into the settings.. The volume rocker and power buttons are located on the right side of the Zenfone 3 Deluxe. These buttons feature the much loved “concentric” circle design which actually makes the buttons less slippery. The circle design is more than just good looks!. Response on the buttons is terrific. If you’re planning on buying this phone I highly recommend on buying a case that leaves the buttons exposed rather than covered. I discovered on my cheap clear case that because it covers the buttons, the silicone over top can create a slightly more cumbersome button press. The official Asus clear case for example leaves the buttons fully exposed which is what you want.. The bottom of the phone features the USB-C charging port with the single mono speaker along side. I will get deeper into the audio experience but that smallish looking speaker grill can deliver crisp, loud audio.. The ZS570KL is the only Zenfone 3 model at launch with a super AMOLED display. The other Zenfone 3 models come with an IPS or IPS+ display technology. Samsung is well known for quality AMOLED displays and the iPhone series uses IPS technology.. It’s difficult to describe the difference between the IPS+ display found on the main Zenfone 3 models and the super AMOLED display found on the Zenfone 3 Deluxe. The super AMOLED is simply more premium looking. It has a sheen to it which is extremely pleasing to the eyes. It’s a selling point for sure and it’s worth paying extra to have.. Asus is a bit tricky with the Zenfone 3 Deluxe default setting. If you think those colors are rich when you first use the phone, you’re right. Upon closer inspection, I noticed in the Asus “Splendid” app that the default display setting is “Super Color” mode rather than the “Standard” mode.. The characteristics of the Zenfone 3 Deluxe display allow it to perform well in outdoor conditions. It’s not overly reflective and the brightness can stand up to bright sunlight. I don’t have a brightness (nits) rating on the Zenfone 3 Deluxe display but it’s impressive enough.. The Zenfone 3 Deluxe (ZS570KL) is a 1980 x 1280 FHD 1080p display which is equal to the flagship iPhone series. Yes there are smartphones with higher resolution such as the Galaxy S series, but there are benefits for going with a 1080p display such as better battery life. Can eyes distinguish such high resolutions on a device with a 5.5-inch or 5.7-inch display is really the question.. The Zenfone 3 Deluxe (ZS570KL) comes with a 3000mAh non removable battery. This size of battery falls about the middle of the pack in comparison to other flagship smartphones such as the iPhone 7 Plus and OnePlus 3. The difference being that the Zenfone 3 Deluxe is the larger 5.7-inch display whereas those other phones are 5.5-inch displays.. The Zenfone 3 Deluxe features Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 technology. This is one of those extras which make this the more premium model and the other Zenfone 3 models do not have it. To make use of this feature, you need a compatible charger which we can happily report comes with this phone.. On the surface, quick charge technology sounds amazing but there is more explanation required. The Quick Charge 3.0 technology on this phone is simply terrific, but it’s not something that you can fully utilize all the time. It really depends on the timing. In some situations you won’t be able to make use of the Quick Charge 3.0 technology because of the reliance on the power adapter. So things like lamps, vehicles, power bars, and portable batteries that have USB ports won’t permit quick charging.. For example, if you just need a battery top up, this technology isn’t going to have the same benefit as the times when your battery is below 70% charge. Quick charge technology is disabled after reaching 70% and the remaining 30% will charge at normal times. So when I did battery charge time tests the results were largely a mixed bag.. Here are some battery charge times:. From my daily usage, I rarely was below 50% when topping up at the night’s end. So in most instances, one hour of charging was about all I needed. If you’ve completely drained the battery then you can get it up to around 80-90% in less than an hour. Obviously charging times vary depending on your starting battery level, if you’re using airplane mode, have any open apps, phone temperature and if you’re using a Quick Charge charger. The bottom line is this phone charges fast which proved convenient.. I’m always curious to know about battery drain overnight while a phone is in sleep or standby mode. Prior to the Android 7.0 Nougat update when I left the phone for around 8 hours overnight with wifi enabled with no apps open, I would generally see a 4-6% battery drop. However after the March update to Android 7.0 Nougat I noticed a big improvement for standby times. Nougat has a “doze” feature which puts the phone in an idle, low power mode and it really does work. You’re going to see a 1-3% drop overnight (approximately 8 hours) which is a big improvement.. If you want to ensure better standby performance, Asus and ZenUI 3.0 offers a few different settings for performance modes and battery saving modes.. It’s also nice to see some custom options like having a schedule setting for when the phone goes into a battery saving mode. This is called “Switch by schedule”.. So you can set for example, that from 10pm to 7am, the phone will run a specific battery saving mode like super save mode. It’s incredibly flexible as to the timing of the schedule and the specific battery saving mode that you want to enable.. In addition there is a “Switch by power” mode which lets you set a power mode based on your battery level. This mode let’s you set up a specific power saving mode on your choosing such at when your battery hits 30%, 25%, 20%, 15% or 10% levels.. I ran a variety of battery tests. The big discovery is that the difference between running the Zenfone 3 Deluxe at 100% brightness vs. When I ran a 2 hour action movie (1080p) at 100% brightness, the battery dropped from 100% to 84%. Running the same test except with 50% brightness, the battery dropped from 100% to 86%. This is the super AMOLED display at work. So you could watch a lot of movies off local storage if you’re on a long road trip.. When it comes to battery life when streaming video, results were decent. I streamed using wifi connection with 100% full brightness and the battery dropped from 100% to 89% after one hour and then down to 77% after watching a movie for two hours. With brightness set to 50%, the battery dropped from 100% to 90% after one hour and then down to 79% after watching a movie for two hours.. If you’re wondering about the Asus Splendid app settings for “Super Color” vs. “Standard” I tested that as well. This setting has no effect on battery drain. More color is not detrimental to battery life.. ZenUI is the Asus layer that runs on the Android OS base and 3.0 is the latest version. Asus ZenUI in the past got negative press about pre-installed apps aka bloatware. A lot of the fear is based on previous generations of Zenfone models which were more hindered by pre installed apps. However this does not mean that the new ZenUI 3.0 and Zenfone 3 series are the same. I’ve been using ZenUI 3.0 over an extended period of time and I find the fear and negativity misleading.. So first off, when you first start the Zenfone 3 Deluxe you can go into settings, then apps, and simply disable any and all Asus related apps. Of course you would need to keep the keyboard otherwise you’re stuck until you download a different keyboard.. The point is if you’re really so worried about pre installed apps you can disable them in a matter of minutes. Then when you go to your home screen and apps pages, they will be bare with the exception of the default Google apps. So from this perspective you can clear the table of Asus apps. Perhaps not uninstalled, but they will be gone from sight and mind.. The pre installed app “Game Genie” is a bit of a nuisance.. It’s on by default and will leave an icon onto of any game that you’re running. It’s like the icon is an overlay which sticks an icon on the left side of your screen while playing a game. I would first suggest checking out the features of Game Genie because it does interact with game streaming and other decent features. However if you want to remove it from sight and mind, you need to go a slightly different route than with the other Asus apps. You need to go into settings and then into “System Settings”, and into “ASUS Customized Setting”, then “Launch Game Genie Setting Page” to disable it.. So if you want the Google dialer, you can find it and install it. If you want the Google clock, you can use that. If you want most of the Google apps on this phone, you can do it. I was able to make the Zenfone 3 Deluxe very similar to what I had on my Nexus 5.. The point I’m making is that ZenUI does not lock down the phone and you can switch things up and use other apps. In my case, I’m more comfortable and familiar with the Google apps and I installed them without issue. ZenUI did not restrict what default apps I could install or use.. Where ZenUI 3.0 shines is with customization and personalization. Choosing a theme is an easy process thanks to the Asus theme store. You can change fonts, icons and various other aspects of your operating system. There is a mini preview for themes and icon packs so you can see what it will look like before you decide to buy or download. There are free and pay options available.. Where ZenUI 3.0 fails is in having too many layers or paths. This means that there are multiple paths to the same location. This also means that you can get a bit lost if you tweaked something and need to find out where you changed the setting.. With the Android 7.0 Nougat update, a few quibbles I had with the pull down “Quick Launch” menu were cleaned up. There is good customization and options available for this menu in addition to a cleaner more pleasant look.. On your home screen, Asus ZenUI 3.0 has a bottom menu which can be accessed via an upwards swipe from the bottom of the screen. Apple users will be familiar with this swipe motion. So at first glance it would appear that this bottom menu is highly redundant. However I started to realize that swiping from the bottom to access system settings was ideal for one handed use in comparison to accessing the top menu. I only wish that the bottom menu allowed for some shortcut or settings like Bluetooth, Airplane mode or Do Not Disturb.. If you are not that mindful of closing apps, Asus help with their ZenUI reminder notification. If ZenUI recognizes a battery draining app that’s running, you will receive a notification. This is actually very helpful because some games for example, will seriously drain your battery as they run in the background.. One aspect of ZenUI 3.0 that I can really appreciate is with the keyboard customization. Now I’ve read reviews that criticize the Asus keyboard and they suggest you should immediately install the Google keyboard. I tried both for the sake of comparison.. Here are the three vastly different keyboard sizes available. The shaded gray area is the size.. The Asus keyboard allow for a dramatic resizing. Not only can you make the keys taller, but you can slide the position of the keyboard which makes it easier to deal with during one handed use. Instead of having the keyboard at the bottom of the display, you can reposition the entire keyboard in the middle of the display which actually makes the phone easier to reach with your thumb. Explore the options because there is a lot to like regarding the default keyboard.. I tried using the Google keyboard and after a period of time it was quite clear that the Google keyboard is far better with AI suggestions and auto correction. But the Google keyboard has somewhat feeble size customization compared to the Asus ZenUI keyboard. There is no clear winner so it ultimately it depends on what’s most important to you. Asus also has ZenMotion which allows you to make a gesture on the display when it is in sleep mode which will quick launch an app of your choosing. I set up a “W” gesture to turn on the flashlight and I can honestly say that having my phone in my pocket often turned the flashlight on. So for me this isn’t reliable enough to trust or use. I don’t want to activate some app while the phone is in my pocket only to have the battery draining without my knowing. Nice idea but it still needs work in my opinion.. The Zenfone 3 Deluxe shares a similar audio setup as many other flagship phones have. You get a single mono speaker that is located on the bottom of the phone beside the USB-C port. It’s one speaker, but it’s a quality speaker. It’s a 5-magnet design with NXP Smart Amp which Asus claims provides four times better performance according to the Asus spec sheet. It’s capable of Hi-Res audio at 192kHz/24-bit output.. I’m not going to get hung up on the Zenfone 3 Deluxe single mono speaker. Stereo speakers that have little separation on the bottom side of a smartphone are not conducive to a great listening experience. What I can say is that the speaker is very loud and it’s very clear even at high volume. It can remain distortion free at high volumes which is what you really need from a smartphone.. You can get a lot better audio experience by using an external speaker or headset. You can shape the audio via the Asus Audio Wizard app which has some presets along with an EQ. The tweaks are far more distinct when using an external audio accessory rather than the onboard speaker.. Part of what makes the Zenfone 3 Deluxe the premium package, is that you get the Asus ZenEar S earbuds included in the box. It’s one of those extras that helps soften the more expensive price for this phone.. Don’t mistake these as the more basic ZenEar because the ZenEar S are the more deluxe model. The familiar Asus “concentric circle” is part of the ZenEar S design. They look good, they feel good and they sound great. The ZenEar S supports Hi-res audio technology. Asus also included a variety of different bud sizes that you can swap out. Even if you have a set of earbuds it’s always handy have a swank new one to try out or give to a friend.. I should also mention that Asus has an audio setting called “outdoor mode”. This is a toggle switch that is displayed alongside the volume slider.. Because this toggle shows up each time you adjust your volume, it’s rather easy to accidentally turn it on. What is “outdoor mode”? It’s a way that you can instantly boost the sound. I didn’t say it’s going to improve the audio quality, but it will dramatically boost the volume. If you don’t need that volume boost, then leave this disabled. To my ears, the “outdoor mode” audio is buggy or glitchy at times. It’s easy to accidentally turn “outdoor mode” on, so beware.. Asus put a top notch Sony IMX 318 lens in the rear of the Zenfone 3 Deluxe. This lens is capable of 23MP photos. The front camera is capable of 8MP photos.. Having a high megapixel camera on the Zenfone 3 Deluxe does not equate to photo excellence. It ensures really big file sizes more than anything. You can obviously choose a smaller size image within the camera settings if you prefer smaller images and smaller file sizes, but changing settings isn’t going to result in better photos.. Photography is a tricky subject to review. The number of variables is vast, as is the skill of the reviewer. So I need to disclosure that I am an average photographer who relies on presets and doesn’t get into manual settings. So what I’m reviewing is the largely the “Auto” settings aspect of the Zenfone 3 Deluxe cameras.. There are much deeper manual settings which obviously will appeal to the more experienced and knowledgeable photographers out there. I will provide some screenshots of the manual settings which hopefully gives you an idea of what the potential is here. I highly recommend that you seek out other online reviews that provide a more expert analysis of the camera performance when shooting in manual mode.. The manual mode gives you control of the following: white balance, exposure value, ISO, shutter speed and focus. If you look at photo samples on the Asus website taken with the Zenfone 3 Deluxe, it’s clear that in the right hands the camera can snap some amazing photos using manual settings.. I did rely on the Auto settings. Asus offers a plethora of presets which can help less skilled photographers. Check out the different options shown in the screenshots below. In particular I love the “Depth of Field” preset. There is lots to experiment with and there are not shortages of options.. Over an extended period of time I used the Zenfone 3 Deluxe cameras in a wide range of settings and environments.. Here are a few examples of the “Depth of Field” preset:. The big 5.7-inch display is great because you can quickly and more easily see if you are in focus prior to snapping your photos. A bigger view finder is always more helpful either before or after taking your photo.. Right off the bat, you will find the laser focus to be fast. You can let the camera find the focus on your own or you can touch the display (called touch focus) to choose your focal point.. There are two benefits to using the “touch focus”. First, slightly changing a focal point means you can manipulate the amount of lighting in a photo. Depending on where you focus, the lighting may improve the photo or make it worse. The benefit here is that you can quickly experiment prior to snapping the photo thanks to the snappy laser focus technology. Second, you can use touch focus to focus on an object that is closer to the camera. This use of touch focus results in a modest “depth of field” (blurry background) effect which appears more professional looking.. Most cameras struggle with indoor lighting and I would say the Zenfone 3 Deluxe is not immune either. I have a dSLR which struggles with indoor low light situations as well. With that in mind, suggesting the Zenfone 3 Deluxe camera is inferior because of indoor photography isn’t a fair assessment. Low light is going to challenge even the best cameras often times providing a mixed bag of results.. Indoor performance under normal lighting conditions provides good results. When lighting is dimmed indoors, you may need to take a couple different photos while choosing different focus points in order to get the lighting just right. So if you have a bit of sunlight coming through your window, you may find some aspects of the photo as washed out or too bright. You can utilize “touch focus” to find a sweet spot within the shot which will reduce or remove the washout from too much brightness.. Speaking of focus, the front facing camera will auto focus on faces.. The 5.7-inch screen does help as a viewfinder. It’s a bit easier to know if you’re in focus or if the lighting is being captured as you like.. The laser focus capabilities of the camera are impressive. Touch focus means you touch the screen and the camera will make that the focus point. Being able to touch focus means that you can find the best lighting results. You will have a good idea thanks to the big screen as to whether you are in focus or not.. Outdoor camera performance is excellent as you might expect. Indoors is challenging for the camera(s) because there is a wide range of lighting or lack of lighting. Indoor performance usually requires a few different photos with different focus points just to ensure one good photo. Take three or four photos and choose the best one. I’m not trusting enough to snap one photo and hoping that it’s perfect.. HDR mode is most times required in outdoor environments. Taking photos with the sky and clouds are more accurate with HDR mode enabled. I’ve included some samples of with and without HDR and you can see the more accurate details with the HDR mode enabled.. See the reflection on the windows. Photo taken with HDR mode off.. As a comparison check out the glass on the building when HDR mode is enabled.. you can see quite clearly in the comparison photos above, you are going to want HDR enabled especially outdoors. The HDR mode is able to reduce contrast glare for more accurate photos. Sky, clouds, and any brighter areas of a photo are more accurate from my experience when using HDR mode.. I feel the Zenfone 3 Deluxe is at its best when shooting video. The quality is due in large part to the OIS (optical image stabilization) and EIS (electronic image stabilization). This technology is employed on both photos and videos but it really shines when video recording. The result is smooth video with little or no noticeable hand shake. I would best call it silky smooth.. There are a few different options of video capture quality. Personally I like 60FPS video at 1080p vs. If you watch 60FPS videos on YouTube you know the difference over 30FPS. It’s substantial and it’s something that doesn’t grow old over time. The good news is that the video taking capabilities of the Zenfone 3 Deluxe are excellent.. (right click and choose “Save Link As…”). Sample 1 – Zenfone 3 Deluxe (ZS570KL) video @ 60FPS ]. [ Sample 2 – Zenfone 3 Deluxe (ZS570KL) video @ 60FPS no audio ]. The front facing camera is 8MP and it fetches excellent results in both photos and video. During a session of Skype the other person did remark how clear my image was. Selfie wise, the results are great outdoors but indoors is a bit more tedious. You can get decent results indoors, but the wide range of brightness levels seems difficult for the camera to deal with. I found taking a few photos and choosing the best one was better than relying on getting a great photo in one try.. I realize a lot of people want benchmark results and I will certainly accommodate those requests. However I also want to make it clear that I’m not a big fan of benchmarks. The reason being is because the top hardware is going to beat the lesser hardware. Benchmarks are going to prove that the more expensive and highest spec hardware is going to fetch better benchmark numbers.. Yes there are going to be some differences even between similar hardware from different phones. There will be small differences in numbers among devices with similar hardware, but the reality is that there will not be big differences in real life speed and performance. Companies can tweak their hardware to squeeze a bit more out of it, but that same hardware on a lesser tweaked device is essentially going to feel the same in terms of speed and performance when you use it.. I’m saying all this even though you’re going to see the Zenfone 3 Deluxe top out among the best smartphones on the planet. I’m able to predict what the benchmark comparisons are going to tell us even before running them. The Zenfone 3 Deluxe has the Snapdragon 820 alongside some super fast 6GB of RAM and UFS 2.0 storage. All this top end hardware equates to impressive speed and the price of the Zenfone 3 Deluxe will garner top benchmark results.. It’s also a good idea for me to clear up some possible confusion about processors. The Zenfone 3 Deluxe model I am reviewing uses the Snapdragon 820. The fastest current processor is the 835 which is found in only a few current smartphones. The second fastest mobile phone processor on the planet is the Snapdragon 821 which is found in some of the competing phones listed in the benchmark result charts below. To confuse matters more, the Zenfone 3 Deluxe Special Edition does have the Snapdragon 821. Therefore the Special Edition model rivals a majority of the current Android phones on the market at the time of writing.. I didn’t just review this phone; I used it exclusively over an extended period of time. It wasn’t about running a bunch of tests over a short period of time. I’ve had enough time to evaluate the Zenfone 3 Deluxe and weigh the good and bad as an end user rather than just a product reviewer.. In terms of beauty, it has an incredible all metal design which really has to be seen and held in person to fully appreciate. It’s not the kind of phone that you want to hide behind a case or cover. It’s begging for a clear case because part of what you’re paying for is a nice looking phone. It doesn’t make sense to hide it.. Not only does it score top marks in the design category, but the Zenfone 3 Deluxe also comes packed with the top end hardware that you would expect from a phone that is named “Deluxe”. The hardware is right up there with the top smartphones on the market even in mid 2017.. The super AMOLED display is the real hero here though. Unlike IPS displays, there is just something special about an AMOLED display. It looks better and I can honestly say that I marveled at it every time I used this phone over the past number of months. I like this AMOLED display so much that I won’t buy another phone without it.. The software side of things may be a point of concern, however I found ZenUI 3.0 to be an excellent addition to Android and not a detractor. There are some tweaks and manual changes that you will likely want, but these are minutes of your time to deal with.. Don’t believe a lot of misinformation and complaining online about bloatware and the Zenfone 3 series. The fact is you can set this phone up how you like and if you want to replace the ZenUI version of apps with Google versions you certainly can. As a test, I set up the Zenfone 3 Deluxe to run apps and run virtually identical to my Nexus 5.. People are often concerned about future Android updates and software updates. Asus has already rolled out the Android 7.0 Nougat update and continues to roll out frequent software updates to improve performance and fix various issues.. I’ve used the camera extensively over the past couple of months and I’ve been happy with the results. As a photographer I have some limitations, but the Zenfone 3 Deluxe has enough custom settings that a more talented and experienced photographer will be satisfied. Low light photography isn’t top of class but most cameras struggle under similar environments. The video taking capabilities of the Zenfone 3 Deluxe are most impressive thanks to the anti-shake technologies and the ability to 4K video or 1080p video at 60FPS.. Asus has stated that they aren’t in the smartphone business to play the race to the bottom in terms of pricing. The fact is there is always someone out there with a cheaper price so it’s ultimately a fruitless pursuit. With Asus being known as having cheaper prices, consumers have been critical of the Zenfone 3 Deluxe pricing.. The Zenfone 3 Deluxe is certainly cheaper than the flagship smartphones from the likes of Apple and Samsung. At the same time there are some even cheaper competing phones that carry flagship hardware as well. Those cheaper phones certainly lack the design and luxurious looks of the Zenfone 3 Deluxe so there is always compromise involved.. So part of the buying decision is based on whether you feel that looks and design are worth paying a bit extra for. Do you want a phone that’s both fast and beautiful or do you want a phone that’s slightly faster and not so beautiful?. With the Zenfone 3 Deluxe, Asus set out to create a phone that can compete head to head with the Samsung and Apple flagship devices. Design wise, the Zenfone 3 Deluxe is at the top or near the top. Hardware wise, the Zenfone 3 Deluxe is right there among the fastest smartphones on the planet even as we approach mid 2017. Frankly speaking it’s the best phone Asus has made to date.. Premium devices come with premium prices. Because I view this phone on the same level as the Samsung and Apple flagships, the price comparisons show that the Zenfone 3 Deluxe is a better value. In fact the Zenfone 3 Deluxe is hundreds of dollars cheaper than the Samsung and Apple flagships when you consider storage and RAM. Asus is offering more for less.. My experience over the past couple of months with the Zenfone 3 Deluxe has been a pleasure. It’s not only nice to look at, but it’s also super fast. It’s certainly worthy of the price tag. The Zenfone 3 Deluxe proves that Asus is a serious player in the phone space and that they can deliver a truly premium handset.. Images of the Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe (ZS570KL).

ASUS ZenFone 3 Deluxe ZS570KL Reviews. ASUS Zenfone 3 Deluxe ZS570KL is a 5.7 inch 1080 x 1920 pixels of display, 4/6GB of RAM, runs on a Snapdragon 820/821 processor.. 5.7 inches, FHD (1920 x 1... 2G, 3G, 4G (LTE), 256GB, ... Please feel free to post your review on this product.. My previous phone was Xperia Z3 Compact.. This one is big, and it pokes out from my chest pocket.. I wanted to put a strap on to prevent dropping, but there is no hole for a strap. I will need to buy a smartphone case with a hole.. It works lightly and I don't get annoyed with it.. It has high-end feel, and works lightly. You can buy Chinese smartphones with decent performance online from other countries, but they are too cheap. ZenFone 3 Deluxe ZS570KL has luxurious feel, and I find it beautiful.. I have 5inch smartphone and 5.2inch one, but at the end of the day, better too big than too small.. I use a substitute machine with Snapdragon 820 4GB 64GB, but because I don't play games, I cannot see the difference. Because it has 256GB ROM, I don't have to worry no matter how much photos or movies I put in. UI is different with each make, but it's the matter of getting used to. I have three smartphones all from different makes.. Screen burn-in is a story of the past.. It is good that I can adjust the ringtone and voice call volume loud. With Xperia, I was troubled with its small volume.. Because I don't play games, I don't need to charge for a day or two.. I'm glad I didn't choose Gold. Its selling point of the antenna line means nothing as I put a case on. I don't like two-toned color, so I chose flashy gold. It is not too flashy, though.. It even doesn't reach to the point where we can talk about its quality. If I could take away stars from zero to make it negative, I would do so. Nothing I would like to write about. I am not including Hi-Res in the evaluation.. I don't have ZenPower myself, but just see what I mean by this.. ASUS ZenFone 3 Deluxe ZS570KL this is my new latest phone just bought this for 2 months now this phone is so cool i love the camera to this no need for a dslr camera because this one is very clear i love the perfromance its the worth the price that is why ive been telling to all my friend to buy like this one its worth the price anything you do with this phone is so cool..

Ang PROCESSING SPEED ay ang mabilis din naman gumana, good nga kasi mabilis din akong maka download ng applications.. Ang CAMERA ang ganda ng kuha sa camera mapa front o back man ay maganda talaga.. Ang BATTERY ay walang problema kasi ang taas at haba ng buhay.. Good afternoon! My smartphone is the best of all phones I ever used and it was asus smartphone is the best the design and display of it was very nice I like it the most. It was also a handy smartphone I like to bring it anywhere I want. Easy also to operate this phone and its not difficult for me to used it. The processing speed also of this phone is working so fast so I can quickly download applications. The camera of it has a good quality of image and the speaker also has a loud volume. The battery life is stayed longer.. May bago na naman akong smartphone kasi dumating ang aking Tito galing sa ibang bansa kaya nga ang sarap sa pakiramdam. Ang ganda nga nitong asus na smartphone kasi ang display ay ang attractive nga. Magaan lang din naman dalhin kaya palagi ko nga naman itong dinadala kahit saan ako mag punta kasi hassle free.

ASUS is happy to welcome the second phone in the world running on the excellent Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, but let’s see how it compares to the first: the ZenFone 3 Deluxe ( ZS570KL ).. Right off the bat, you’ll see that the ASUS ZenFone 3 Deluxe has a few advantages over the Google Pixel, such as a bigger screen, more RAM, higher storage capacity, and an extra SIM slot. With that preliminary comparison between the the Google Pixel and the ZenFone 3 Deluxe done, let’s take a closer look at some of the individual feature categories.. The Google Pixel is built with a mix of glass and aluminum, punctuated with antenna lines along the edge and rear. Meanwhile, the ASUS ZenFone 3 Deluxe boasts a truly unified, all-aluminum exterior with antennae lines hidden with revolutionary machining techniques. Your mileage may vary on which looks better, but here’s a closer look at the ZenFone 3 Deluxe to help you decide.. Google is talking a big game about the photographic capabilities of the Pixel, but it’s relying primarily on benchmark scores. We’ll have to wait to see what the final products look like, but the ZenFone 3 Deluxe packs the same autofocus techniques (phase detection and laser) and focal length, but includes a higher megapixel count on the sensor and optical image stabilization. While looking at pictures, you’ll also enjoy a better contrast ratio on the ZenFone 3 Deluxe (3,000,000:1, compared to 100,000:1).. Finally there’s another phone out there using the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, but the ZenFone 3 Deluxe still has the Google Pixel beat with 6 GB of RAM, a slightly higher clock speed on the processor, a higher maximum internal storage at 256 GB, and the addition of microSD memory cards. With that much room and horsepower, you’ll be able to enjoy games, music, and much more multimedia on the ZenFone 3 Deluxe than the Google Pixel.. Before you take the plunge on a Google Pixel, be sure to take a good close look at the ZenFone 3 Deluxe.

Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe (ZS570KL) Review. Roydon Cerejo , 22 December 2016. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The phone features 256GB of storage plus microSD card support. Performance is very good in all departments. The Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe with 256GB of storage costs Rs. Asus seems to have saved the best for the end of 2016 -. it only recently began selling the ZenFone 3 Deluxe in India. This is its latest flagship offering, with all the bells and whistles you'd typically expect from an Android flagship. We recently reviewed the ZenFone 3 Ultra (ZU680KL) , which despite its high-end pricing, isn’t really at the same level when you consider its specifications.. What we have on test today is the top-end version of the Deluxe, which features a very generous 256GB of storage and the top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC. 62,999, the ZenFone Deluxe has the Google Pixel series and Samsung’s Galaxy S7 series as competition, which is not an easy crowd to go up against. Is the ZenFone 3 Deluxe a convincing enough package to make you look beyond the obvious choices? Let's find out.. Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe (ZS570KL) design and build The ZenFone 3 Deluxe has many firsts to its name but the one that grabs our attention is the invisible antenna design. For a unibody metal smartphone, this is quite an achievement considering most other flagships, including the iPhone 7 and Pixel, have visible antenna bands around the back. to have found a way to circumvent this aesthetic problem without compromising. You can still see bits of radio-friendly material. embedded into the chamfered bezel, but they're barely visible.. The rounded sides and slightly curved back offer. good ergonomics when you hold this phone with one hand. It feels really light too, and the matte finish on the back doesn’t attract fingerprints. There’s also Asus’s trademark ‘spun metal’ design on the top and bottom of the front side.. Asus has gone with a 5.7-inch. Super Amoled display with a full-HD resolution. While the pixel count is still a respectable 386ppi, we feel that a Quad-HD display would have been the ideal choice for a phone of this calibre. Nevertheless, we like the fact that the narrow bezels make. this phone only slightly larger than a Google Pixel XL. Colours are nicely saturated and brightness is very good. You also have an option to tweak the colours and the colour temperature in the Settings app.. There’s a USB Type-C port at the bottom and a speaker grille beside it, while the 3.5mm headphone socket is placed on the top. The ZenFone 3 Deluxe has a hybrid SIM slot with 4G support. Around the back, there’s a slight bump for the camera, and a rectangular cut-out for the fingerprint sensor. The sensor works well in terms of authenticating you, but its awkward shape causes occasional failed attempts if your finger isn’t aligned well.. The ZenFone 3 Deluxe ships with a Quick Charge 3.0 compatible power adapter, Type-C cable, ZenEar S headset, SIM ejector tool, and warranty information. The packaging feels premium and the quality of the accessories are very good too. Overall, the Deluxe is a stylish and very well-crafted smartphone that’s pleasantly light for a phone of its size. Our only niggle here is with the shape of the fingerprint sensor, which we didn’t find conducive enough for easy unlocking.. Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe (ZS570KL) specifications and features Asus sent us the 256GB version of the ZS570KL, which is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 SoC and has 6GB of RAM. On the other hand, the 64GB version of the ZS570KL is powered by the older Snapdragon 820 chip but the rest of the specifications and features stay pretty much the same. Other connectivity features include a dual-band Wi-Fi ac with 2x2 MIMO support, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, NFC, USB OTG and FM radio. Currently, VoLTE isn't supported so you won't be able to make voice calls over Jio. However, Asus say that this will be fixed in an upcoming update.. The phone puts up a good show in benchmarks, although the OnePlus 3T still manages to nudge past it in most tests. AnTuTu returned a score of 155,041 while 3DMark Unlimited gave us a score of 30,100. All the numbers point to very good performance, which is also reflected during actual usage.. On the software side, we have the familiar ZenUI 3.0 skin running on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The software tweaks are similar to what we’ve already seen on the ZenFone 3 Ultra and the ZenFone 3 Max ( Review ). As we’ve stated countless times, ZenUI simply feels too cluttered, and might be overwhelming for first-time Asus users. We appreciate the amount of customisation. available but it also feels a bit unnecessary. The bundled apps include Puffin, Truecaller, Amazon Kindle, SimCity and Need for Speed: No Limits. There are plenty of apps from Asus too, including PhotoCollage, MiniMovie, ZenCircle, etc, which you cannot uninstall even if you don't need them.. The Settings app gets some additional features like OptiFlex, which can speed up the launch performance of up to 10 apps. However, we didn’t really notice any difference with it enabled. ZenMotion lets you set touch and motion gestures, including a quick toggle for one-handed mode by double-tapping the home button. The Deluxe also gets an ‘Always-on’ display feature which lets you set an analogue or digital clock as a screensaver. Panels display information about missed calls, messages, battery status, and the date. However, they’re not as slick as the always-on panels of the Samsung Galaxy S7.. Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe (ZS570KL) performance Our experiences apply to the high-end model with the Snapdragon 821 SoC. The phone performs very well in everyday tasks, despite its heavy skin. Scrolling through menus is smooth, without any hint of stutter. We didn’t find the stock ZenUI keyboard to be very good due to the annoying delay while typing, but Google's Gboard can come to the rescue here. The display’s touch response is very good too. The phone does heat up if you use the camera a lot but not. to the point where it’s uncomfortable to even hold it.. The ZenFone 3 Deluxe handles multimedia playback very well too. All our high-bitrate full-HD and 4K video files played flawlessly. The vivid display makes watching movies enjoyable. There’s only one speaker but the sound is amplified so it’s much louder than your average smartphone. Asus’s AudioWizard app lets you tweak audio settings on a global level.. The Deluxe also supports high-resolution audio through the headphones socket, which the bundled ZenEar S headset handles pretty well. This headset features 10mm drivers that take good advantage of the phone's built-in DAC. The headset favours high frequencies more than mids or lows, which can sound a bit too sharp for some. comfortable to wear even for long durations.. but no volume controls, which is disappointing.. The ZenFone 3 Deluxe packs a 23-megapixel rear sensor with four-axis OIS and electronic stabilisation. There’s also laser autofocus in conjunction with PDAF to help get faster locks on your subjects. In reality, this worked well in daylight as well as low light, and we never faced any focus hunting issues. Continuous autofocus also means that the device can switch. focus between subjects as you change the frame. Image quality is very good in daylight shots, resulting in detailed landscapes and macros. Colours are captured accurately and the sensor delivers a good depth of field effect in close-up shots. We didn’t find the ‘Auto HDR’ feature to work too well, and we often had to switch to HDR manually as it wouldn’t kick in.. Tap to see full-sized Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe camera samples. The camera app has a ton of shooting modes, including Super Resolution, Manual, and Panorama. Low-light photography is very good as fair bit of details are preserved and noise is controlled. It’s not as good as the Pixel XL or Galaxy S7, but it's close enough. The front camera does an excellent job of capturing detailed selfies even in indoor lighting. Video recording maxes out at 4K 30fps but you also have the option of shooting at 1080p 60fps and slow-motion. The quality of recorded video is very good, and the framerate. The 3000mAh battery can easily run for about a day and a half with regular usage. In our HD video loop test, we managed to get 12 hours and 33 minutes of runtime, with the power mode set to ‘Normal’. When switched to ‘Performance’ mode, we got just 8 hours and 13 minutes. In this mode, we didn’t notice any major performance improvements in apps and none of the benchmarks revealed any benefit either, so it’s best to stick to the ‘Normal’ mode. Since the phone supports Quick Charge 3.0, we were able to get to 65 percent charge from bone-dry. Verdict This special edition ZenFone 3 Deluxe is priced at Rs. 62,999, which makes it a good flagship contender. It’s also the only Android option to offer this much onboard storage plus the ability to expand it further. With streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video now supporting offline viewing, it doesn’t hurt to have more storage.. While the ZenFone 3 Deluxe is a very good flagship, we wish Asus would ease up on the custom treatment of Android, as it can be a little too intrusive at times. We would have liked to see a better designed fingerprint sensor, plus we think a Quad-HD display would have been more appropriate for such a high-priced phone.. If a good camera is what you’re after, then we recommend looking at the Google Pixel or Samsung Galaxy S7 series, which are a notch better than the Asus. If you want a little bit of everything without emptying your bank account, then there’s always the OnePlus 3T.. Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe in pictures.
