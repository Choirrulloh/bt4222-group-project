Huawei Mate 10 Porsche Design - user opinions and reviews. The price is still cheaper than an Apple iphone X, however for the price it should at least be able to have a micro sd card support, and have wireless charging. Probably the next version after 10 will implement those changes that way they can keep ch.... Not to mention the US version of this phone only has one sim slot not 2 !!!!. It consts 62800 SDG, is it rational? a cell phone that could be finished by a drop down costs this amount of money??? this is unbelievable..

Then check out our best Black Friday deals 2017. Huawei has just announced a Porsche Design variant of its latest flagship, the Mate 10 Pro .. Loaded up with an 18:9 screen and a 4,000mAh battery, the Mate 10 Pro is already an impressive smartphone, so what can the luxury Porsche Design branding add to the mix?. As with the Mate 9 Porsche Design, Porsche’s Mate 10 Pro swaps out the default colour-scheme for a deep black version.. In-hand, it feels identical to the standard Mate 10 Pro, looks sleeker and has a tendency to attract a few more fingerprints.. A 6-inch 18:9 screen, curved glass back and fingerprint scanner all combine to produce a very handsome, rich-feeling smartphone.. Loaded up with a vertical strip and the Porsche Design logo at the back, there’s no mistaking this thing for the vanilla version.. Update : We've added US-specific pricing and release details below.. Unlike the vanilla version, this premium offering ships with 256GB storage, though sports identical remaining internals - a dual-camera, Kirin 970 processor and Android 8 under the hood.. What’s more, the Porsche Design branding also means that Huawei can command a very hefty €1,395 ($1,225, around £1,240, AU$2,090) asking price.. Anyone thinking - Huawei has lost the plot asking that kind of money, hold that thought. With this phone’s announcement came news that its predecessor - the Mate 9 Porsche Design - has officially sold out.. Sporting the same price, there’s clearly a market for limited run, very expensive Porsche Design smartphones - and since Porsche Design jumped ship from BlackBerry to Huawei two years ago, both company’s public perceptions have been going from strength to strength.. It will be available in 20 countries from November, including the UK, UAE, Qatar, Singapore and a host of other European, Middle East and Asia locations. In February, it will be launching in the US..

We've already seen what Samsung and Apple have to offer, but maybe Huawei has a trump card ready? We finally get a glimpse of the new devices in the Mate series.. The Mate 10 series was just unveiled at an event in Germany and rumors were spot on with three high-end devices getting unveiled today - a regular Mate 10 and a Mate 10 Pro with its corresponding Mate 10 Porsche Design. There is also a Mate 10 Lite in the family, but that was unveiled earlier and didn't get to share the stage time with its more premium siblings.. Huawei has redesigned the new Mates in line with the most recent trends but also succeeded to add an original spin of its own. The company has trimmed the bezels and has added curved glass panels to the backs. The Mate 10 is updated with a QHD resolution screen, while the Pro gets an 18:9 AMOLED display.. The Mate 10 flagships are the company's first smartphones to feature the new 10nm Kirin 970 chip, which brings a new processor, faster GPU, and a brand-new NPU (neural-network processing unit).. Indeed, many of the novelty features of the new devices make use of machine learning and Huawei has added this chip to provide hardware acceleration for these tasks.. The camera got a brighter lens and upgrades in processing. The new chipset comes with dual image signal processing units with movement recognition and the real-time scene and subject recognition powered by the new NPU.. The Mate 10 Pro, just like last year, swaps the IPS screen for an AMOLED one. It's an 18:9 aspect ratio screen but it surprisingly has a lower screen resolution compared to the Mate 10. The Pro however gets IP67 water-proofing, which is not available on the regular model.. Finally, the Porsche Design model is the same as Mate 10 Pro , but adds a glossy finish on the frame and Porsche branding..

The Mate 10 Porsche Design is Huawei’s Luxury Flagship for The Year Last year, Huawei released a special edition of the Mate 9 in collaboration with design studio, Porsche Design. According to Huawei CEO Richard Yu, the Mate 9 Porsche Design sold 10 times more than they expected. That success has prompted a second partnership resulting in the birth of the Mate 10 Porsche Design. The Mate 10 Porsche Design is inspired by the Porsche 911. It has a glass uni-body and its exterior is handcrafted. Its UI has also been specially designed to reflect that it is a luxury device. Just like the Mate 10 Pro, it has its fingerprint scanner on the rear. However, instead of the horizontal stripe design found on the Mate 10/Mare 10 Pro, it features a vertical one that covers the cameras, fingerprint scanner, and the Porsche Design logo. It also ditches the Huawei logo on the lower bezel for that of Porsche Design. The Mate 10 Porsche Design has the same specs as the Mate 10 Pro – 6” 18:9 OLED display, Kirin 970, EMUI 8.0 based on Android 8.0 and a 4,000mAh battery. It also doesn’t have an audio jack. Where it differs in terms of specifications is in the RAM and storage. Instead of 4GB RAM like the standard variant, it has 6GB. Built-in storage is also a massive 256GB which should be more than sufficient. The Huawei Mate 10 Porsche Edition will have dual SIM support, NFC, and Bluetooth 4.2 with aptX/aptX HD and LDAC HD. It will come with 2 chargers (UK and EU), a leather case, 2 USB-C cables, USB-C earphones, a 3.5mm audio adapter, and a VIP card. Pricing for the Huawei Mate 10 Porsche Edition is a whooping €1395 and availability is scheduled for mid-November. The phone will be available in Diamond Black.

Huawei Mate 10 Porsche Design Renders Leaked Online. Mobile Phones Huawei Mate 10 Porsche Design Renders Leaked Online. Huawei huawei mate 10 Huawei Mate 10 Porsche Design porsche design. A render of the upcoming Huawei Mate 10 Porsche Design has appeared online. From what we can tell, it takes the Mate 10 and dials the style up to 11. Which is something to be expected from what will likely be Huawei’s most premium device.. The renders clearly show the FullView display, all 5.9-inches of it with edge-to-edge glass. The screen looks to be a 18:9 ratio display, and has scarily thin bezels on the top and bottom – which speculates the phone will be similar in size with last year’s Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design despite the larger screen.. The cameras at the rear of the phone is receiving new design treatment. The camera modules now are separate, and in line with the rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. These cameras are rumoured to have new f/1.6 lenses.. We may see IP67 water resistance rating with the new Mate 10 Porsche Design, in-line with the rest of the Mate 10 family. Also rumoured is a large battery capacity of 4500mAh.. The phone will be powered by the new HiSilicon Kirin 970 processor , and may feature up to 6GB of RAM, and with a base capacity of 64GB, with larger storage models in tow.. We are about three weeks away from the official launch on October 16, so we are waiting with anticipation how the new Huawei flagship will be like.

Please enable JavaScript to view comments.. Firmware Files Suggest Existence of Huawei Mate 10 Porsche Design. For most of us, the price of a smartphone is perhaps the most important factor when considering a new smartphone. That’s why we balk at the rising prices of smartphones as seen in the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. and the Google Pixel 2 XL. But for some, the price isn’t that big of a deal. Some limited edition smartphones are catered towards those who really like a particular design or branding, and their price tags are often much heftier as a result. Last year, the Huawei Mate 9 was announced. and, while the regular model retailed for around. €699 the more expensive Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design retailed for $1,500 on Amazon. If you’re a fan of the Porsche Design, then you’ll be happy to know that Huawei will likely launch the Huawei Mate 10 Porsche Design along with the Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro this October 16th.. We are very confident of this fact given the existence of a particular firmware file that is distributed internally by Huawei. BLA-AL00-porsche-cn is presumably the Chinese regional model of the Huawei Mate 10 Porsche Design. The “BLA-AL00” refers to the base model Huawei Mate 10 Pro which the Mate 10 Porsche Design will be based on (much like last year’s Mate 9 Porsche Design was based on the Mate 9 Pro).. Digging through the firmware file itself, we can see that it is rather sparse in content since the base firmware that is installed is just the Mate 10 Pro’s firmware. The firmware file does contain all of the Porsche Design’s signature wallpapers, audio files, and boot animation, however. As I don’t have a Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design to compare to, I can’t tell which, if any, of these media files are new. In case you’re interested, here are the wallpapers we extracted, though we’ll refrain from posting the audio files until the device is officially announced.. This is the strongest evidence that we have found pointing towards the existence of the Huawei Mate 10 Porsche Design. Noted leaker Evan Blass confirmed the existence of 3 Mate 10 variants : the Huawei Mate 10, Huawei Mate 10 Lite, and Huawei Mate 10 Pro, but we believe that the Huawei Mate 10 Porsche Design will be the 4th variant.. Blass did make a vague tweet. about the Porsche Design, but it doesn’t seem he was ultimately too confident about it. Other than that, there was a sketchy set of renders that were claiming to be of the Mate 10 Porsche Design, but as we’ve recently been reminded it’s quite easy for someone to fake these kinds of renders.. The firmware I used to obtain this information was provided for me by FunkyHuawei.club , a service which lets you install pre-release Huawei firmwares, recover bricked devices, and rebrand/convert China region phones to international variants.

Huawei has just announced a Porsche Design variant of its latest flagship, the. Loaded up with an 18:9 screen and a 4,000mAh battery, the Mate 10 Pro is already an impressive smartphone, so what can the luxury Porsche Design branding add to the mix?. Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus Release Date, Specs and Price. As with the Mate 9 Porsche Design, Porsche’s Mate 10 Pro swaps out the default colour-scheme for a deep black version.. In-hand, it feels identical to the standard Mate 10 Pro, looks sleeker and has a tendency to attract a few more fingerprints.. A 6-inch 18:9 screen, curved glass back and fingerprint scanner all combine to produce a very handsome, rich-feeling smartphone.. Loaded up with a vertical strip and the Porsche Design logo at the back, there’s no mistaking this thing for the vanilla version.. Unlike the vanilla version, this premium offering ships with 256GB storage, though sports identical remaining internals - a dual-camera, Kirin 970 processor and Android 8 under the hood.. What’s more, the Porsche Design branding also means that Huawei can command a very hefty asking price of AED 5,299- beat that iPhone X!. If you're thinking that's a lot of money and who will buy it, hold that thought. Huawei had previously announced that its predecessor - the Mate 9 Porsche Design - had officially sold out.. Sporting the same price, there’s clearly a market for limited run, very expensive Porsche Design smartphones - and since Porsche Design jumped ship from BlackBerry to Huawei two years ago, both company’s public perceptions have been going from strength to strength.. Nokia 9 Could Launch in January, Alongside a New Nokia 8. The Porsche Design Huawei Mate 10 comes in exclusive Diamond Black Color and is available for purchase at the Huawei brand store located on level 2 at the Dubai Mall.. © Future Publishing Limited Quay House, The Ambury, Bath BA1 1UA.

The Huawei Mate 10 , Huawei Mate 10 Pro and Huawei Mate 10 Porsche Design are Android smartphones , designed and marketed by Huawei as part of the Huawei Mate flagship series. It was first released on 16 October 2017. 1.1 Huawei Mate 10 Lite. The Mate 10 series is powered by Huawei's all-new AI -focused processor, the Kirin 970. The Mate 10 is backed by 4 GB of RAM coupled with 64 GB storage, while the Mate 10 Pro is backed by either 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage, or 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage. [3] The most expensive model, the Porsche Design gets 6 GB RAM and 256 GB storage. In China, you can get the Huawei Mate 10 with 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage just like the Pro model although the rest of the world can buy it through online stores. Both phones feature a near-bezelless display with the Mate 10 having 81.79% screen to body ratio while the Mate 10 Pro having 81.61% screen to body ratio. The Mate 10 has a typical 16:9 aspect ratio, while the Mate 10 Pro has the new 2:1 ratio. A 5.9-inch LCD display panel with RGBW arrangement is used in the Mate 10, and a 6-inch OLED panel made by BOE [5] in the Mate 10 Pro. Surprisingly, the Mate 10 has a higher resolution than the larger Mate 10 Pro ( 1440p to 1080p ). The phones' body is made of 3D glass with aluminum frame. [3] Both front and back of the phone is covered with Gorilla Glass 5. Huawei once again partnered with Leica to engineer the dual-lens camera in the Mate 10 series. The camera is a 12 MP RGB sensor with a f/1.6 aperture, along with a monochrome 20 MP sensor with the same f/1.6 aperture. Only the RGB camera is supported by optical image stabilization. Due to this dual-lens camera setup, the camera is capable of creating bokeh shots and it is adjustable even after taking the shot. Both phones have a large 4,000 mAh battery with fast charging. Huawei claims that the phone can be charged from 1 to 20 percent in 10 minutes, and from 1 to 58 percent in 30 minutes. Ports on the Mate 10 include a 3.5mm headphone jack , and a USB-C charging and data transfer port. However, the headphone jack is not present on the Mate 10 Pro, which, instead has IP67 water and dust resistance while the Mate 10 only has IP53 rating. Huawei also released a "Lite" version of the Mate 10 with midrange specifications. [7] It is also known as the Huawei Nova 2i in Malaysia, Huawei Maimang 6 in China, and Huawei Honor 9i in India.. The phones run on Android 8 "Oreo" , with Huawei's own custom skin, EMUI 8.0 on top of it. [3] The previous EMUI version was 5.1. Huawei decided to upgrade it to EMUI 8.0 to match the latest Android version number, which is 8.0 as well. It has some new features, notably the desktop mode called "Easy Projection", which is a custom desktop interface, similar to Samsung DeX , which appears when connecting the phone to a display via an HDMI-to-USB-C cable. The Huawei Mate 10 series receives a mostly positive reviews, especially regarding the camera department. DxOMark gave it an overall 97 points, similar to the more expensive iPhone X and only 1 point behind the Google Pixel 2. [9] Most reviewers also gave a high praise to the long battery life thanks to the 4000mAh battery [10] but criticizes the heavily skinned EMUI software and the lack of certain features such as WLAN without MIMO, Bluetooth 5.0, and wireless charging for both models.. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro lack of QHD+ resolution, storage expansion, and a headphone jack also receives some criticism from reviewers. Though in other aspects, it manages to get praises including a bright and accurate-color OLED display, LTE Cat. 18 [11] , Dual-VoLTE, Dual-SIM, aptX HD, a strong performance, very fast quick-charge technology, water and dust proof (IP 67), high-quality build, exact location determination and excellent voice quality. ^ "Huawei Mate 10 and 10 Pro announced: Which one is the real flagship?".

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars ditch the crappy iphones and galaxies!!! Get yourself a Mate 10 Pro!! you will be glad you did!!!. Color: Titanium Gray | Offer Type: Devices only | Verified Purchase. have had IPhones since the Iphone 4. this thing blows iphones away!!! great picture! great camera! and great sound! its super fast and works on T Mobile a lot better than any of my old iphones ever did! it feels good in my hand or in my pocket, its not too big nor is it too small, its just damn right! Huawei has a new customer for life!! thank you so much for bringing it to the US!! the only negative thing i can think of at this moment is so far im having a hard time finding a good case that i like the look of for it. i ordered one and when it came in it was just cheap feeling and didn't fit right. i had my eye on 3 others that were a bit more expensive but they are all out of stock now.. i used Lunatik for my iphones but i don't think they are even in business any more.. may have to check them out and see if they still are and make a case for the Mate 10 Pro. forgot to mention the battery life. now granted i don't use my phone as a computer like most people do..i don't sit around and surf the internet with it, i don't have a tun of games i play all day long... that being said compared to my iphone the Mate 10 Pro's battery life is much better. doing the same things i normally do in a day i used way less battery than i would on my iphone. by the time i got home from work today i think i was sitting at 95% charge if not more. on my iphone it would be at 50% or less... thank you again Huawei for bringing the Mate 10 Pro to the US!!!. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing phone, no regrets!. Color: Midnight Blue | Offer Type: Devices only | Verified Purchase. I just received the Mate 10 Pro today, and I am blown away by its performance. I've put it through hell and the battery has exceeded my expectations. This phone easily has the best battery performance I have ever seen in a cell phone. The camera is great, the screen is bright and has great resolution. The fingerprint sensor is fast, and precise. I love how quickly it responds to touch. The processor is fast, and everything has been running smoothly. I'm using the phone on T-mobile - - no problems at all. I have used Samsung and Apple phones in the past, and can honestly say that the Mate 10 Pro is a high quality phone equal to (and maybe even surpassing) some of the better known brands. This phone is worth a try!. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome performance.. Color: Titanium Gray | Offer Type: Devices only | Verified Purchase. This is my first look at this cool phone. I was in the Market for the Mate 9 about a year ago when I found out that this one will be out soon. The wait is over and I'm not disappointed. Data transfer from my old Samsung Galaxy S6 took a mere 12 minutes, and I had a good 20 GB of Data to transfer. Simply download and install "Phone clone" from the App store, load it on both Phones, and you are good to go. (follow the instructions) The performance is stunning, very smooth running, I had all my custom sounds and apps running in no Time. It does come with a clear Case, which I did not care for too much, so I purchased one from Tudia, it is much more robust and protective. After 30 or so minutes, I had all my important apps working, set up multiple Email accounts, etc. A little gripe, but not too big of a deal is that it requires the USB C style Cables. Also, it doesn't support wireless charging. A bigger Deal is that it doesn't come with Alexa. Everyone is raving about the Battery life on this thing, and I have several power hungry apps running at the same time, so we will see about that and I'll report it here. I haven't used the translator yet, but it looks fantastic. The Camera is truly a marvel, shoots pictures on a very high resolution, the Camera actually recognizes what you shoot and therefore picks the right (or sometimes wrong) settings for you. The Fingerprint sensor is ultra fast, I use it to unlock the phone. I know I have only begun to work with this phone, there are many more very cool options to use and I'll report it here as soon as I uncovered some useful tricks. So far I'm impressed, to say the least. Update: Verizon Customers, listen up! (read carefully) QUIT asking if this Phone will work with VERIZON. EVER! At least read through some older questions before you post yours. Was this review helpful to you?. Very smooth handling, excellent responds when touch, Battery last for long long time....even though using for a whole day, received for less than a week, too much surprise, like... 5.0 out of 5 stars Thank You Huawei !. I never used iPhone before, but my wife and daughter use iPhone. I had Nexus 5x, 6 before. They always laugh at me about the screen color and picture quality. 5.0 out of 5 stars Best Android phone I had. I bought the phone and gift card as part of the pre-release deal. So far I am very pleased with the phone. It opens instantly from fingerprint, and runs speedily during use. 5.0 out of 5 stars Satisfied customer at 48 hours.. Best smart phone y bought until now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. I was really excited for this phone and I have two SIM cards, only to find out that this version is single sim and not dual. 3.0 out of 5 stars very disappointed, also not stated in the description that this .... One reason I don't love iphone or Samsungs are you see them EVERYWHERE. I wanted a GREAT phone but one that maybe everyone and their Grandmother may not own too. 5.0 out of 5 stars Best Smartphone I ever had.... I'm upgrading to this from an LG g6. I never upgraded this fast after a phone purchase, but this phone just had so much more that I wanted battery, wired TV connection, more ram,... 5.0 out of 5 stars Love it.. I am throwing my cameras away, why you need to spend money on camera when this phone can do it better. Five stars to Huawei Mate 10 Pro.. 5.0 out of 5 stars More than just a smartphone.. There is really a lot to like about this phone but a few issues might be a deal breaker for me. I always use high end phones and was currently using the Pixel 2 XL before this... 3.0 out of 5 stars A beauty that skipped a few classes. Offers some nice features such as a (limited) desktop mode that would have served me well. 3.0 out of 5 stars No WiFi calling on T-Mobile.

Huawei Mate 10 Porsche Design price in Pakistan. Huawei Mate 10 Porsche Design's expected price in Pakistan is Rs. Its expected launch date is 17-11-2015. Please come back again to view lowest price from trusted online stores.. PriceOye DOES NOT sells mobile phones! We only help you save money.. Full Specifications of Huawei Mate 10 Porsche Design. Hybrid Dual SIM (Nano-SIM, dual stand-by). 6.07 x 2.93 x 0.31 in. Octa-core (4x2.4 GHz Cortex-A73 & 4x1.8 GHz Cortex-A53). Mate 10 Pro with “ceramic-look” exterior?. Almost similar hardware for 70,000 more rupees. The release of the Mate 10 series was a big event for Huawei , as this year’s phones are actually intelligent. As usual, the Mate series have a very premium limited edition Porsche Design variant, which will cost you more than Rs. Despite being the most expensive Mate 10, the Mate 10 Porsche design has nothing more to offer in the looks department than the ceramic looking glass back it has. It’s not even real ceramic since that is rather expensive to make, but it might have justified the immensely hefty price tag the phone carries since the aesthetics are barely distinctive to the Mate 10 Pro.. The body dimensions are exactly the same and so are the screen size and resolution. That is a 6-inch screen with QHD resolution meaning the exact same 546ppi pixel density. The only other notable difference is the positioning of the rear dual cameras. It’s now vertical rather than horizontal.. Compared to the Mate 10 Pro, the Mate 10 Pro Porsche Design only has extra internal storage, with capacity maxing out at 256G without the option for expanding. Other than that, the Mate 10 Porsche Design has the same Kirin 970 processor, 6GB of RAM and 4000mAh battery. If you were hoping for something for, your genuine disappointment won’t come as a surprise to us by any means.. More Mobiles like Huawei Mate 10 Porsche Design.
