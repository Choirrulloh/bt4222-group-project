The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime is light on pocket and doesn't compromise on performance. The smartphone looks premium, lasts longer than its rivals, clicks decent images and sails through most of the tasks without breaking a sweat.. Specifications: Design Hardware Display Performance Camera Here are some camera sample shots Battery Likes Dislikes Verdict. Last week, Xiaomi announced the company's latest budget handset- the Redmi 3S in the Indian market. Available in two form factors- the standard Redmi 3S and a slightly powerful Redmi 3S Prime, the handsets further spice up the budget smartphone market in India, which currently has handsets from other Chinese smartphone makers (Lenovo, Motorola, Huawei, Asus, etc) and Indian brands like Intex, Micromax, Reliance and others.. The company says that the Redmi 3S/3S Prime is entirely a 'Made in India' product and is basically an improved version of the Redmi 3, which never made it to the Indian shores. The Redmi 3S Prime that we are going to talk about today in the following review is priced at Rs 8,999 and comes with a fingerprint sensor, which makes it one of the few handsets priced under Rs 10,000 with the additional security feature.. The standard variant of the handset- the Redmi 3S costs Rs 6,999 and does not include the biometric sensor. It gets 2GB RAM and 16GB of internal storage as compared to 3GB RAM and 32GB of internal storage offered by Redmi 3S Prime. Besides RAM, internal storage and fingerprint sensor, the other specifications are identical.. Now the question that everybody is asking these days- Is the Redmi 3S Prime the best smartphone in under Rs 10,000 price bracket? We try to answer this with the following review.. OS: Android 6.0.1 Lollipop with MIUI 7. CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 SoC, 2GB/3GB RAM. Storage: 16GB/32GB storage, microSD card support by up to 128GB. Cameras: 13MP rear camera ( with LED flash), 5MP front camera. Price: Rs 6,999 (16GB +2GB ROM) Rs 8,999 (32GB+3GB). Xiaomi Redmi 3S and 3S prime are classic examples that a sub Rs 10,000 smartphone can look as good as a flagship device. Unlike big giants such as Samsung, LG, Motorola that are sticking with plastic or polycarbonate materials for their budget offerings, Xiaomi and some other Chinese brands are offering metal unibody designs in the same price segment. Xiaomi Redmi 3S/3S Prime clearly beats those non-metallic handsets when it comes to look and feel.. The smartphone draws inspirations from the popular Redmi Note 3, which is one of the best looking budget handset selling in the market. You can even call the Redmi 3S/3S Prime the smaller version of the Redmi Note 3. And it's not just about how the handset looks; the Redmi 3S Prime is also very comfortable to use. The full metal unibody design with slightly curved back makes Redmi 3S/3S Prime the perfect fit for one hand operation. If you miss the good old days of Apple iPhone 5/5S, then you will love the Redmi 3S.. Adding to this, the handset does not feel like a 5-incher and the fact that it packs in a 4,100mAh battery unit, simply makes it more appealing.. The front has the 5-inch IPS display with minimal edges and touch capacitive buttons placed at the bottom of the display. The top of the display has the 5MP camera, light sensor and earpiece.. The hybrid SIM card tray is positioned on the left and the volume rockers along with the power button are placed on the right side. The microUSB port is placed at the bottom and the top has the 3.5mm headphone jack along with a mic and an IR blaster.. The rear side has the camera lens on the left corner along with the LED flash. The fingerprint scanner is ergonomically positioned in the centre where your index finger sits on it without making any efforts. A large speaker grille is given at the bottom.. As I mentioned earlier, Xiaomi has launched two variants of the Redmi 3S in the Indian market. Both the smartphones are powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 CPU clocked at 1.4GHz. The processor is coupled with an Adreno 505 GPU to take care of graphical intensive tasks.. While the standard Redmi 3S comes with 2GB of RAM and 16GB base storage, the Prime variant features a 3GB RAM and 32GB internal memory. You can expand the inbuilt storage by up to 128GB via a hybrid- microSD card slot.. The dual-SIM smartphone sports a 5-inch HD (720x1280 pixels) IPS display and runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow-based MIUI 7.. As far as imaging goes, Redmi 3S features a 13MP rear camera with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF (phase detection autofocus), HDR mode and 1080p video recording. The front of the smartphone packs a 5MP camera with 1080p video recording capability.. The dual-SIM handset is backed by a 4,100mAh battery unit and has 4G LTE, VoLTE, Wi-Fi, GPRS/ EDGE, Bluetooth, GPS/ A-GPS and Micro-USB as connectivity options.. The smartphone will be available in Grey, Silver, and Gold colour variants.. The Redmi 3S/3S Prime sports a 5-inch 720p display, which can be criticised considering the growing trend of Full HD screens in budget price segment. However, in case of Redmi 3S Prime, the lower resolution display did not give me any major reasons to complain about. The 720p display churns out a pixel density of 294ppi, which is acceptable for a 5-inch footprint. The display offers vivid colours and is bright enough to make content visible even in outdoor conditions. I even found the display brighter than the Redmi Note 3 and the LeEco Le 2.. The display has minimal bezels and the metal trim that runs on the front panel is slightly raised from rest of the body. This will protect the display if you keep the smartphone upside down on a table.. The display settings allow you to tweak the contrast and colour levels as per your requirement. You can set it to Automatic, Increased contrast and Standard. Besides, you also get a Reading mode that turns the display colours to a warmer tone in case you are using the smartphone in complete darkness.. Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime is the first phone with a Qualcomm 430 chipset in India. While it is not the fasted CPU from Qualcomm, the computing performance it offers in support with 3GB of RAM is more than enough to handle your everyday tasks and even some high-end jobs such as gaming, video playback and photo editing.. During my usage, there were no visible lags or stutter while navigating between home screens and/or multitasking. I used the device to edit images; played games such as Spiderman Unlimited, Dead trigger 2 and the Adreno 505GPU handled the game play with no performance issues. I even pushed the handset to its limits by playing heavy games like Asphalt 8 Nitro and Marvel Alliance 2, which can even give a tough time to mid-range and some flagship devices launched in 2015. There were noticeable frame rate drops but if you already using a budget smartphone from 2015 or some recent ones, then you will not see much of a difference. Besides, the 3GB RAM was more than enough to handle the everyday multitasking.. Next on my list was to check whether the handset has heating issues when pushed to its limits. To my surprise, Redmi 3S Prime did not get as hot as other devices in the same price bracket, and is quite heat efficient. I even found it to be a better handset in handling heat when compared to the Redmi Note 3 during stress testing.. Overall, the smartphone offers a smooth computing and multitasking experience, possibly the best in sub Rs 10,000 price category.. Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime features a 13MP rear camera with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF (phase detection autofocus), HDR mode and 1080p video recording. The front of the smartphone sports a 5MP camera with 1080p video recording capability.. The 13MP rear camera is fast and responsive and is capable to deliver decent shots when the lighting is adequate. The colour reproduction is also good and the pictures taken have acceptable detailing. However, the results are not satisfactory in poorly lit situation. The images come out to be noisy if you are shooting indoors. But then you cannot ignore the fact that it is a sub Rs 10,000 smartphone and in that case, it does a decent job.. Besides, you also get Xiaomi's usual camera modes such as HDR, Beautify, Panorama, Manual Mode, various Scenes and a total of 12 filters to play around with the images.. The battery performance is simply the highlight of the smartphone. Despite its small size, the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime is equipped with a humongous 4,100mAh non-removable battery unit hat can easily last for a day, even if you play games, watch videos, play music, click pictures and browse web. This is because the battery has to support a lower resolution 5-inch display and the Snapdragon 430 processor, which is quite efficient in everyday usage.. If you are an average user who use the smartphone for occasional gaming, music playback and do the usual stuff like WhatsApp, Facebook, etc. then Redmi 3S Prime can easily last for more than a day on a single charge.. I recommend this device if you are looking for a smartphone with amazing battery life in sub Rs 10,000 price bracket.. The metal clad Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime is one of the best looking handset in its price segment. The 720p display is crisp, the battery is simply amazing and overall computing and multitasking performance is also appealing.. It's quite hard to find a flaw in Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime. could have been better in the imaging department and that too when you. are shooting in low lighting conditions..

I had purchased this phone based on the various marketing information that the brand and Flipkart had published. Upon receipt the phone looked decent for the money spent.

Ketan Pratap , 08 August 2016. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime has been priced at Rs. The highlight of the Redmi 3S Prime is its build quality. The Redmi 3S Prime packs 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. (Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime camera samples). There has been stiff competition in the sub-Rs. 10,000 segment, and majority of smartphones launched lately in this price band have great specifications. This year in particular has been a good one for Indian consumers looking for budget phones, as companies are racing to offer more for less.. Xiaomi, which has had a great run in the Indian smartphone market with the well-received Redmi Note 3 ( Review ) and Mi Max ( Review ), is keeping up the pace with a new smartphone priced below Rs. and Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime. are the company's latest attempts to. strengthen its position in the segment, and they both also tout the 'Made in India' label. Since its debut in India two years ago, Xiaomi has managed to earn a reputation for offering great smartphone hardware at affordable prices, and these new models are trying to stay true to that formula.. Both the Redmi 3S variants sport all-metal bodies and pack large batteries. We got our hands on the Redmi 3S Prime, which offers more RAM, more storage space, and a fingerprint scanner for a small price increase. Does the new Redmi 3S Prime offer great value, or does it just end up being a smaller version of the Redmi Note 3? We try to find out in our review.. Look and feel When we first saw the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime, it looked like a mini Redmi Note 3 from nearly every angle. Xiaomi phones have started to look quite similar in design. For the company, this might be a way to establish a linear look throughout its product portfolio but sadly this is what Samsung did few years ago with its Galaxy smartphones, and we weren't fans of that move for long.. In this case, the front of the Redmi 3S Prime is almost identical to that of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3, except for the placement of the sensors above the display. We get capacitive Home, Back, and Recents buttons right below the display, and the sensors and front camera sitting on either side of the earpiece just above it. To some extent, this phone also looks inspired by the Mi Max which features a massive 6.44-inch display. However at 8.5mm thick, the Redmi 3S Prime isn't as sleek as the more premium Mi Max ( Review ) which is just 7.5mm thick.. The rear panel packs the primary camera with its LED flash, both placed in the upper right corner. The back also has the fingerprint scanner placed in the middle. There are thin lines running across the top and bottom of the back of the Redmi 3S Prime, which we have also seen before on the Redmi Note 3 and Mi Max.. The speaker grille is at the bottom of the back. The physical buttons for volume and power are on the right, while the hybrid SIM slot is on the left. The phone accepts one Micro-SIM and another Nano-SIM or microSD card for storage. Unfortunately, this means that users will have to choose between a second SIM and a microSD card.. There is an infrared emitter and a 3.5mm audio jack on the top. The bottom has a standard Micro-USB port and a microphone. The Redmi 3S Prime sports an all-metal body which means that the device itself feels premium regardless of the price tag it carries. At 144 grams, the Redmi 3S is slightly heavy for a budget device, but the curved sides make it easy to grip. The extra weight can safely be put down to the massive battery inside the smartphone.. One of the major differences between the Redmi 3S and the Redmi 3S Prime is the former doesn't include a fingerprint scanner. The round sensor at the back is easy to reach and use. During our review period, we had no trouble unlocking the device at any time using the fingerprint scanner. The 5-inch screen makes this phone easy to use with one hand, which is what we did most of the time. We found that typing was particularly comfortable.. The Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime ships with power adapter, a SIM eject tool, and an instruction leaflet. Just like the Redmi Note 3, the Redmi 3S gives bundled earphones a miss, which might be disappointing for some buyers.. Specifications and software Under the hood, the Redmi 3S and Redmi 3S Prime both pack the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 (MMB29) processor, with four cores clocked at 1.1GHz and four cores at 1.4GHz, plus an integrated Adreno 505 GPU. Apart from the fingerprint sensor, the only differences between the Xiaomi Redmi 3S and Redmi 3S Prime are the amounts of RAM and storage. The Redmi 3S features 2GB of RAM with 16GB of inbuilt storage, while the Redmi 3S Prime has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.. At the time of their launch, Xiaomi claimed that the Redmi 3S and Redmi 3S Prime are the first smartphones with the all-new new Snapdragon 430 SoC shipping in India. Both models support expandable storage using a microSD card (up to 128GB).. The 5-inch IPS display has a resolution of 720x1280 pixels. Our Redmi 3S Prime review unit's screen was vibrant with sunlight visibility not suffering at all. Xiaomi's Sunlight Display hardware feature, which the Redmi Note 3 sports but is absent in this smartphone, could have further. The brightness levels on the Redmi 3S Prime were good and colours never looked oversaturated. The viewing angles on the Redmi 3S Prime were also decent and the display for the most parts was fairly sharp and reproduced accurate colours.. For connectivity, the Redmi 3S Prime (and Redmi 3S) support 4G with VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth, GPS/A-GPS, Glonass, and Micro-USB. The Redmi 3S Prime is compatible with all LTE bands in India including the FDD LTE Band 3 and Band 5, as well as TDD LTE Band 40. Xiaomi notes that when using two SIM cards on the Redmi 3S Prime simultaneously, the primary SIM will support 4G (calls and data) while the second SIM will support 3G only.. Another notable feature of the Redmi 3S Prime is its large 4100mAh battery. There's a 13-megapixel rear camera with features like PDAF (phase detection autofocus), f/2.0 aperture, HDR mode, 1080p video recording, and an LED flash. You also get a 5-megapixel front-facing camera which supports 1080p video recording.. The device runs MIUI 7.5 which is based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. The skin is a slightly updated version of what came with the Redmi Note 3. Unfortunately, you won't see many Marshmallow features such as Now on Tap. The company is expected to roll these features out in the next MIUI release.. The dropdown shade is divided into app notifications and quick settings toggles, and thankfully it isn't cluttered. The option to reply directly from a message notification is slightly confusing. In most Android Marshmallow phones, pulling down the notification expands it, but with MIUI, users need to use two fingers, similar to how you zoom in on an image. In our case, most of our attempts to expand the notification using this gesture failed, and we had to use both our hands to use it reliably. This was annoying to some extent.. On long-pressing the home button, the phone launches the Google Now cards by default. Long pressing the Recents button at the home-screen offers options to add widgets, move icons, change the wallpaper, and choose between animation effects. The Child Mode previously seen on the Mi 5 , Mi Max and Redmi Note 3 ( Review ) is also available.. As usual with Xiaomi phones, there is no app drawer and all icons are placed on the homescreens. Some of the pre-loaded apps include SwiftKey, Amazon, Amazon Kindle, WPS Office, Flipkart, and Facebook. There's also Theme Centre which makes it easy for users to flip through new themes, wallpaper, and ringtones; Security, which clears RAM and lets you manage installed apps; Mi Remote which takes advantage of the IR emitter to control appliances; and Mi Store, from which you can buy more Xiaomi products.. Users get 5GB of free storage when they register for a Mi account. We were particularly surprised to see some of the software enhancements from the premium Mi Max - including the one-handed mode and Quick Ball shortcut menu - included in the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime as well. Both these features were introduced on the Mi Max to simplify usage as it came with a 6.44-inch display.. You can go through our Mi Max review to understand how these functions work. We felt that the Redmi 3S Prime was usable with just one hand, and there was no need for these touches, but they might still be useful for some people. The company also plans to upgrade the Redmi 3S Prime to MIUI 8 , something Xiaomi's MIUI Product Lead, Jai Mani, stated at the device's launch.. Performance The Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime sets a standard for other smartphones in the same price band. We didn't face any lags while multitasking on this device, and there were no noticeable frame rate drops while playing games like Dead Trigger 2.. Apps loaded quickly and the screen responded to touches without any complaints. The only issue that we faced was occasional restarts while running benchmarks, which is a repetition of what happened during the review of the Redmi Note 3. There was no heating while charging the phone or talking on calls. The phone did heat up a bit while using the camera app, but it never became too uncomfortable to use. We encountered no issues while talking for long hours on the phone.. We did try using the fingerprint scanner on the Redmi 3S Prime with wet fingers and it worked without refusing to recognise prints even once. We were impressed with the speed of fingerprint recognition.. The quality of sound through the speaker at the back of the handset was impressive, except that it went flat at maximum volume with no stereo effect. We did check the quality of music through our own wired earphones and we were not disappointed. There are plenty of tweaking options for music lovers.. Recent Xiaomi phones have an excellent feature called Mi Drop, which is basically is a Wi-Fi Direct peer-to-peer file transfer system and lets users share big files between Mi devices. The feature is limited to just Xiaomi devices but it eliminates the need for a third-party app such as ShareIt.. The 3GB of RAM was enough for carrying out most functions. Regardless of how many apps were open at any given time, the Redmi 3S Prime had up to 800MB of RAM free which is not bad at all. In terms of performance in benchmarks, the Redmi 3S Prime came out with decent scores. It managed 40,250 on AnTuTu, 21,253 overall in Quadrant, 5,714 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme, and 24fps in GFXBench's T-Rex test.. Camera The camera on the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime took sharp images with a good amount of detail. Indoor shots in well-lit conditions were particularly impressive and didn't have noise or lack detail in textures when zoomed in. Low-light shots were slightly washed out, though turning HDR mode on fixed this to some extent. We also didn't face issues in locking focus at any time.. The rear camera can record videos at 1080p quality and there's also a time-lapse video feature. The camera modes on the Redmi 3S Prime include Manual, which allows tweaking white balance and ISO, and Panorama for wide angle shots. There are also 12 filters which is a nice addition.. The 5-megapixel front camera clicked some decent selfies and came with 36 smart "beautification" profiles which can be use to enhance images. There's also face recognition, which worked soon after a face was detected in the frame. Another great feature is ability to record videos at 1080p quality with the front camera.. Battery Life The non-removable 4100mAh battery on the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime managed to run for 14 hours and 50 minutes in our continuous video loop test, which is excellent. The Redmi 3S Prime trumps the bigger Redmi Note 3, which managed around 12 hours in our loop test, in part because of this phone's lower-resolution display. Even with heavy usage, the Redmi 3S Prime easily managed to last through an entire day, with a minimum of 20 percent juice still left in the battery.. Xiaomi claims that the 5V/2A charger will ensure quick charging with minimal downtime. We noticed that it took slightly over two hours to fully charge the battery from zero to 100 percent.. We did run into one or two software niggles though. For example, we could never get an alert from the NDTV and Gadgets 360 apps despite granting all the necessary permissions, a functionality that works just fine on other phones.. 8,999, the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime no doubt brings a lot to the table. The metal body feels premium, while the 4100mAh battery offers the user enough power to last more than a day. The 3GB of RAM makes sure that the user doesn't face any lags.. The overall package looks smart and brings a strong new contender to the sub-Rs. What might attract people more than all that is that this phone doesn't have a large 5.5-inch display, and is therefore easy to use in daily life. Those looking for alternatives to the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime can go for the Asus ZenFone Max (2016) ( Review ) which sells for the same price. If you want a larger screen and a bit more performance, you could also go for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 which is available at a slight premium compared to the Redmi 3S Prime..

In one way, the Redmi 3s Prime is the compact version of the company’s highly popular and successful Redmi Note 3.. It features a 5-inch HD (1280x720pixels) IPS display with pixel density of 294ppi. Under the hood, the Xiaomi Redmi 3s Prime runs on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 430 octa-core processor paired with 3GB of RAM.

On the front, you have a 5-megapixel camera with the f/2.2 aperture for selfies and video calling. On the connectivity front, the Redmi 3s Prime includes support for 4G LTE and VoLTE voice calling support, dual hybrid SIM slot, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, and Wi-Fi 802.11n. Fuelled by a 4,100mAh battery, the Redmi 3s Prime runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow OS- based MIUI 8.. At its price range, the Redmi 3s Prime will go heads on with Intex Aqua S7, Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus, and the Moto G4 Play. The Intex Aqua S7 is priced at Rs 9,499, the Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus is priced at Rs 8,499, whereas the Moto G4 Play will set you back by Rs 8,999.. The Moto G4 Play features a 5-inch HD (720p) display. It is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 410 quad-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and Adreno 306 GPU. With 16GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot for further expansion is also present.

The Moto G4 Play is armed with a 2,800mAh battery, which the company claims is good enough to last for an entire day. With connectivity options such as dual-SIM card slots, 4G LTE with VoLTE support, Bluetooth 4.1 (LE) and A-GPS, the smartphone runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box. Though the Moto G4 Play misses out on the fingerprint scanner, Motorola has added water-repellent nano-coating making it splash resistant.. The Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus, on the other hand, also features a 5-inch display, but of a higher full HD (1080p) resolution. It is powered by a 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor clocked at 1.5GHz along with 3GB of RAM and Adreno 305 GPU.

Under the hood, the smartphone is powered by a 64-bit MediaTek MTK6735 quad-core processor, which is paired with 3GB of RAM.

The Aqua S7 is equipped with a 3,200mAh battery. On the connectivity front, it supports dual-SIM card slots, 4G, VoLTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi 802.11n, and GPS. The smartphone runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow out-of-the-box. Just like the Redmi 3s Prime, the Intex Aqua S7 also comes with a fingerprint scanner for biometric authentication.. Other than the three smartphones that the Xiaomi Redmi 3s Prime stands against, it somewhat also stands a chance of comparison against the Xiaomi Redmi 3s, which was launched alongside the Xiaomi Redmi 3s Prime. The two smartphone have almost identical specifications and fall in a price category close to each other. Essentially, Xiaomi Redmi 3s would be like buying the Redmi 3s Prime at a lower cost, slightly lesser RAM and devoid of a fingerprint scanner. It is priced at Rs 6,999.. The Xiaomi Redmi 3s, much like the Redmi 3s Prime features a 5-inch HD display. It runs Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 430 octa-core processor coupled with 2GB of RAM, as against the 3GB of RAM on the Redmi 3s Prime. Again, as opposed to the 32GB that the Redmi 3s Prime feature, the Redmi 3s, comes with 16GB of internal storage, which also is expandable up to 128GB using a microSD card. Similar to its sibling, the Redmi 3s Prime, the Redmi 3s also sports a 13-megapixel primary camera and a 5-megapixel front camera.. OS Android v6.0.1 (Marshmallow) based MIUI 7.

For those, who were not satisfied with the specifications of previously released Xiaomi Redmi 3s , Xiaomi mobile has released the prime version Xiaomi Redmi 3s Prime with improved performance and added features. Basically there are three major differences between these two phones. 3s Prime has got 3 GB RAM, 32 GB ROM whereas 3s had only 2GB RAM and 16 GB ROM. Moreover, this prime version has got fingerprint sensor in it which the previous version didn't had. The impressive thing is that, in spite of these valuable updates, the price didn't increase too much. Device like this under 15k is a real good deal. Especially, from a decent and popular brand like Xiaomi. Great battery backup, 4G network support for much faster internet browsing, amazing gaming and multitasking ability, strong security, classy camera and fine display makes it an ideal low-mid range smartphone with premium features..

Xiaomi's Redmi 2 and the Redmi 2 Prime has been a huge hit in the Indian market and one of the major reason seems to be Xiaomi's pricing strategy.

Was this review helpful? 0 0. By Tanya Tanya on February 21, 2017 | Verified Owner. Bought this phone at a price of Rs 9000. I am quite satisfied with this phone. As I am a music lover and this phone has Dolby atmos which makes it one of the best sound smart phone available in the market.. The processor is a 1.4 GHz Snapdragon 430 64-bit octa-core CPU and it is the first phone in India to have it. For gaming it comes with a GPU of Adreno 505. The 13 megapixel primary camera is great and very quick. It can focus on a subject in just 0.1 seconds. Its not a full HD display The SIM card slot is a hybrid one The quality of the secondary camera in low light condition is not good. It produces wavy or noisy like images in low light and artificial light as well.. Was this review helpful? 0 0. By Dhaval Mehta on February 24, 2017 | Verified Owner. Best phone under this range, camera quality both front & rear is superb, I think if you want to buy phone under 10k, then it would be the best choice..

Xiaomi’s Indian launches are accompanied with a lot of fanfare: there’s big venues, a lot of Mi fans are invited, extensive talks and demo… they go the whole nine yards. But with the Redmi 3S , Xiaomi chose to come in without too much ceremony.. The phone actually went on its first sale before a media or a public event was held, on the 9th of August, but that does not mean the phone is any less.. I had a chance to play with the Redmi 3S and the Redmi 3S Prime at a Media Meet held in Mumbai on the 10th of August. The Redmi 3S and 3S Prime are very similar devices, so I will just note the differences where they exist. For the most part, the experiences are interchangeable. So here are my quick, first impressions on the devices:. For starters, the design of the phones give you no clues on its pricing. It’s got the same metallic build from the Redmi Note 3 with similarly-colored plastic caps on the top and bottom (that means it is not a metallic. uni-body , as other blogs often quote these devices as being). There’s a very impressive and sturdy feel in the hand. Since both the devices bear a 5″ screen, their overall dimensions are also smaller and are on par with other 5″ phones like the OnePlus X. After using the gigantic Mi Max for the past few weeks, it felt really good to finally have a phone in hand which you can grip without a worry in the world. The Redmi 3S is very pocket-friendly, and the thickness of the device is actually impressive considering how much battery capacity. During the event, Xiaomi India’s Product Lead, Jai Mani mentioned how a very large chunk of the Redmi 3S and 3S Prime interior is basically occupied by the battery, and this decision was taken instead of making the phone thinner by trimming it by wild margins. Nonetheless, the Redmi 3S is actually thinner than its predecessor, so they managed to balance both.. OnePlus One next to the Redmi 3S Prime. Pardon my poor choice of wallpaper.. The Redmi 3S and 3S Prime sport a 5″ HD LCD display. These are essentially budget devices, so the decision to stick with 720p resolution is something that not a lot of its target audience would complain about. The pixel density of the device is 294 ppi, which comes off as good for its price range but nothing more. If you’re willing to stretch your budget, you’ll find competition bearing FHD displays (one of them is from Xiaomi’s own stable). was limited, but I can see the display size and resolution working well in conjunction with the rest of the product specs and its budget.. Thin Black Bezel Borders can be seen around the device.. One thing that miffed me with the Redmi 3S and the 3S Prime is that there are (thin) black bezel borders around the device, while the marketing material edit it out. This is common for a lot of Chinese smartphones sold in India, so much that most consumers are now used. I wish this trend changed with either the bezels being evenly colored throughout the front, or the marketing material stopped trying to mislead, but this is some wishful thinking on my end. Since the device is not marketed as a media-consumption device, this aspect of the device is something that can be ignored.. The insides of the Xiaomi Redmi 3S and 3S Prime is something Xiaomi is rather. If you look at pure specs and numbers, the devices start with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 SoC, which packs a dual-cluster, octa-core configuration of Cortex-A53’s clocked at 4x @1.4GHz and 4x @1.2GHz, built on a 28nm fabrication process.. The Adreno 505 accompanies it on the GPU end. In comparison, the closest competitor to the SD-430 is the SD-616, which beats it. in the peak clock speed (4x @1.7GHz) of the performance cluster, but seeing that both clusters are still based on the power-efficiency-based Cortex-A53, the difference is not too large.. The GPU on the SD-616 is older. the Adreno 405, so the SD-430 remains competitive overall. Again, the SD-430 is not a top-end SoC, but seeing the pricing on the device (especially the base variant) and the rest of its features, it is actually impressive.. The Redmi 3S comes with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage, while the Redmi 3S Prime comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Both can be expanded using the hybrid dual-SIM slot for an additional 256GB.. During my limited usage, the phones worked as well as phones usually do in demos. Apps opened snappily, and the phone gave no hints on its pricing with its performance. This is something that needs to be noted of in this price range, as phones often settle on the SoC, being the region where a lot of first-time customers are not informative on. Yes, the Cortex-A53’s are not meant for performance-oriented tasks and both devices cannot claim to be gaming-friendly. But if you go in with expectations that match with. low price, you will walk out pleasantly impressed. The lower res screen will also aid with GPU performance, but again, gaming is still not expected to be the strongest suite and that is alright.. The camera setup on the Redmi 3S and the Redmi 3S Prime follows a 13MP rear shooter with a f/2.0 aperture and PDAF. There’s LED flash as well, along with the capability to record 1080p videos at 30fps (which again, is nice enough for this price range). The front is a 5MP camera with f/2.2 aperture and again, 1080p video recording. Budget devices are not known for their camera prowess, and this will be no exception to the lot. Will it be ahead of its price competition? Possibly. Again, lowered expectations for lowered budgets.. Camera is very slightly raised towards the top curve. Left side is bare but for slots.. Micro USB port on the bottom. 3.5mm Earphone jack and IR Blaster on top. There are a few interesting parts to the Redmi 3S and the Redmi 3S Prime which are not seen around in this price. bracket(or even outside of it, to be honest). Both devices come with an IR blaster, a feature that even flagships have dropped off. If you set it up right, you can control all your home appliances with it, and in this segment, a feature like this is something that you can show off. Xiaomi’s Mi Remote application supports quite a few appliances, and the setup procedure is also quite simplified if your device is within the supported models.. What you can also show off is the insane battery capacity and the (likely) ridiculously insane battery life. For a first impressions article to comment on battery life is a bit far fetched, but the ingredients are present to have Xiaomi knock it out of the park again. First, the battery is densely packed with a capacity of 4,100 mAh. The display is a 5″ HD panel, and the SoC is comprised of Cortex-A53’s which are primarily power-efficient cores. Add to that MIUI, which is heavily optimized for devices designed. to run it, along with it keeping a tight reign on background apps. The end result is that the phone can likely achieve 2-days of battery life for most consumers with moderate use — I comfortably obtained 1 day battery life with heavy use on the Redmi Note 3, and I can crank out 2 days of life with moderate use on the Mi Max. So I can confidently say that the Redmi 3S will follow along on the same footsteps, unless something goes horribly wrong.. Getting regular two days of use on moderate usage, or one full day with heavy use should be achievable on the Redmi 3S if past experience as a reviewer is anything to base claims on.. The software on the Redmi 3S and the Redmi 3S Prime is MIUI 7.5 out of the box, running on Android 6.0.1. The review units were sporting the June security patches. Keeping in mind that these are starter devices, this is actually quite good. We can expect regular MIUI updates with security patches, but Xiaomi’s MIUI updates do not exactly coincide with an Android version update. So you might still be on Android 6.0 even if you get MIUI 8 or whatever comes after it. Xiaomi did not make any official statement on this aspect of the device, so there is still hope.. About Screen on the Redmi 3S Prime. Upcoming updates to MIUI on the Redmi 3S and 3S Prime in the form of MIUI 8 will allow two app instances to exist alongside (called Cloned Apps ), which can open the door to using two accounts with several apps and games without needing to log in and log out from one. This can allow you to use two WhatsApp accounts (since it is a dual-SIM phone), lets you have separate instances of log-ins for work and personal social media accounts, two instances of games (Clash of Clans, anyone?) and so on. is not live yet, so I could not demo it. But when it does go live, it will add to the value of the device.. The Redmi 3S Prime has one more distinguishing feature from the Redmi 3S, in addition to the differences in storage and RAM. The Redmi 3S Prime sports a fingerprint sensor on the rear, and this sensor is the same as the one on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. The Note 3’s sensor worked quite well for the most part, so there should not be many complaints on this model. The fingerprint sensor is a bit recessed on the back, and with the overall dimensions of the device, it is very easy to reach with your index and middle fingers.. To conclude the first impressions of the Xiaomi Redmi 3S and the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime, I’d like to bring attention to the prices of these devices. The Redmi 3S will cost you just. ₹6,999 ($105) , while the Redmi 3S Prime will cost you ₹8,999 ($135). The pricing of the Redmi 3S is what I find really impressive, in terms of bang-over-buck from the Redmi 3S Prime. A difference of $30 gets you an additional GB of RAM (which makes a noticeable difference, as I will note in my Mi Max review), some more internal storage (you can expand via microsd) and a fingerprint sensor. Depending on your needs, these may be very useful to justify the increase in price. But looking from a starter device perspective, the Redmi 3S offers the better deal.. The Redmi 3S Prime, albeit still a good device, does not offer as much value as its base brethren. Xiaomi’s own device in another segment gives it some very serious competition. ₹1,000 to the price of the 3S Prime (totaling $150), you can snag up a Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 16GB. Granted, the RAM amount and the storage are step downs, but the increase in processing power thanks to the much-better Snapdragon 650, the increase in screen size and the bump in resolution. Unless you have a very hard budget limit of. ₹8,999 ($135), it makes more sense to go with the much more powerful Redmi Note 3. I personally don’t recommend people to buy the 2GB RAM variant of the Redmi Note 3 (Snapdragon 650), but if you are planning to go for the Redmi 3S, you may as well upgrade to this. Of course, if you can spare some more cash, the best deal and still the uncontested king in the lower. mid-end is the Redmi Note 3 with 3GB RAM at. for the Redmi 3S, I think it is a very good deal. I have been looking for a replacement recommendation in place of the Moto E in the lower price brackets, and the Redmi 3S makes for a very good starter phone. It is not a flagship, it is not a mid-end device. It is a budget device, recommended for those that do not have very high needs nor high budgets, for those that want to get away from monstrous screen sizes, and for those that are looking for cheap burner phones.. Thanks to the aggressive pricing on the part of Xiaomi on the Redmi 3S, it is very well the figurative Moto E of 2016. You just need to get used to MIUI, which can be harder than it sounds..

August 9, 2016 UPDATED 13:44 IST Follow @TwitterDev Follow. August 9, 2016 UPDATED 13:44 IST READ LATER. The Redmi 1S and Redmi 2 (along with the Redmi 2 Prime) have done well for Xiaomi. Together with Motorola's Moto E, these phones have given buyers on a tight budget some good options. These are also the prime examples of value for money. The budget phone segment would not have been the same witho. Design and build quality Display Software The Redmi 3S Prime runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow-based MIUI 7 out-of-the-box, much like the Mi Max. As expected, you get a user interface with lots of fancy colours schemes and animations, and no app drawer. Latest software iteration does not necessarily translate to drastic changes in Xiaomi's interface. There's generally very little difference between a KitKat-based MIUI and a Marshmallow-based MIUI which could be a deal-breaker for stock Android fanatics, even more so because Xiaomi's MIUI kills off key Android 6 interface elements, like Now on Tap. Performance and battery life The Redmi 3S Prime is powered by a 1.4GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processer coupled with Adreno 505 GPU and 3GB of RAM. It comes with 32GB of internal memory which is further expandable by up to 128GB via a microSD hybrid card slot. The dualSIM phone supports 4G LTE (VoLTE-ready) and USB OTG. Camera Should you buy it? Xiaomi makes some good phones. More importantly, it makes good phones that are also aggressively priced. The combination is quite a steal, I tell you. Rival companies are catching up really fast. The Mi 5 is perhaps the company's biggest lost opportunity in India. The Mi 5 although an excellent all-rounder, hasn't been a hit like its previous flagship phone, the Mi 4. This is because the OnePlus 3 trumped it big time. The Redmi Note 3 was a glimmer of hope then, but even that phone is facing some stiff competition from the likes of the LeEco Le 2. The Redmi 3S Prime therefore is a very important phone for the company. This is because it follows the Redmi 2 Prime, a massively popular smartphone in India. Honestly, when company vice president for global, Hugo Barra told me (not long ago) that the Redmi 3 (the original Redmi 2 Prime successor) may not come to India at all, I was a little disappointed. The Redmi 2 Prime was special; it was in fact a benchmark defining phone in its product category for a really long time. To not have its successor come to India was just sad, for me, and for everyone who had patiently been looking forward to it. The Redmi 1S and Redmi 2 (along with the Redmi 2 Prime) have done well for Xiaomi. Together with Motorola's Moto E, these phones have given buyers on a tight budget some good options. These are also the prime examples of value for money. The budget phone segment would not have been the same without the Moto E, or for that matter, the Redmi 1S and Redmi 2.. This year, things are a little different. The Moto E3 doesn't exist in the Indian market (for now) and even in places where it has been displayed, like in the UK, it doesn't exactly dazzle. Xiaomi's Redmi 3S Prime on the other hand, instantly strikes you as a greatest hit of the budget segment. And once you start using it, the impression only gains in strength. In fact, the Redmi 3S is so good that it makes you want to question the existence of the Redmi Note 3.. Not long ago, Xiaomi sized-up the Redmi Note 3 to make the gigantic Mi Max. Now, it just shrunk the Redmi Note 3 down to make the Redmi 3S Prime. The Redmi 3S Prime is simply the Redmi Note 3, only scaled down to fit the Redmi 2 Prime's cute and comfy form factor. 5-inch phones are hard to come by these days. The Redmi 3S Prime belongs to that rare category of smartphones. And to me, that's a huge thing. You see, I just love 4.7-5-inch phones. They just have the right size. The Redmi 3S Prime, as expected, feels right in the hands. It's not as small as last year's Redmi 2 Prime (which was 4.7-inch) and yet not as phablet-sized as the Redmi Note 3 (which is 5.5-inch).. Size is not the only "big" highlight of Xiaomi's new ultra-budget smartphone. The Redmi 3S Prime boasts of a full-metal body: a first for any smartphone in and around this product category. The top and bottom ends are of course plastic with brushed metal finish and have a slightly different hue as compared to the rest of the body, but given its low price, I think you should give it the benefit of doubt. An all-metal smartphone at just under Rs 9,000 was a sight for soar eyes, until now.. Also Read: Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 review: Mr dependable like Rahul Dravid. The Redmi 3S Prime weighs in at just over 140 grams, which isn't quite that much when you consider the fact that it's housing a 4,100mAh battery inside. What is remarkable here is that even though it crams in such a ridiculously huge battery inside, the phone feels practically the same no matter how you hold it. An even distribution of weight throughout its body, coupled with a 5-inch form factor ensures the Redmi 3S Prime isn't as slippery as some of the other metal-clad smartphones in the market, including the Redmi Note 3. But it is a metal smartphone, after all. Things are bound to get a little slippery every now and then.. On the front, a chrome strip helps a great deal in balancing the equation, enhancing grip. So much so that the Redmi 3S Prime is easily the most ergonomic all-metal smartphones at its price point right now. The power button and the volume rocker are on the right, while the dualSIM hybrid card slot lies on the left. The phone's speaker vent is located on the rear lower end.. The Redmi 3S Prime is simply the Redmi Note 3, only scaled down to fit the Redmi 2 Prime's cute and comfy form factor. The Redmi 3S Prime has some kind of scratch-resistance protective coating on-board, but folks back at Xiaomi wouldn't tell me exactly what kind. "For protective glass, we use multiple suppliers and can't comment on which exact one, but its quality is up to what you'd expect from the premium competition," is what a Xiaomi spokesperson told me. You might want to keep a tempered glass at hand if you're planning to buy this phone.. The Redmi 3S Prime comes with a 5-inch HD IPS LCD display with a 720x1280 pixels resolution which roughly translates to 294ppi pixel density. Brightness levels are just about adequate and adaptive brightness works as it should.. Colours look rich and vibrant -- a little warm by default -- but there's a manual mode inside that helps achieve better results. There's also an in-built reading mode that turns colours to the warmer end of the spectrum for night-time reading.. The Redmi 3S Prime is sadly missing out on Xiaomi's hallmark Sunlight Display technology. This means even though the phone has good enough brightness levels indoors, these go for an all-out toss when you're out in direct sunlight, so do the phone's viewing angles. Despite its somewhat low brightness output, the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime still manages to better rival phones around its price category in display department, especially in colour accuracy.. If, however you are not a "stock Android fanatic", MIUI 7 offers all the bells and whistles that you'd want from a fully-functional operating system, including themes. Moreover, the upcoming MIUI 8 is expected to bring back features like Now on Tap. Even if it doesn't, the MIUI 8 is definitely going to be a thorough upgrade to its predecessor. I've been using the MIUI 8 beta for a while now, and some of its features like scrollable screenshots, second space and dual apps are worth the wait..

Additionally, the Redmi 3S comes with an IR-blaster that can be used (in tandem with the Mi Remote app or even some third-party solutions) to control smart home appliances.. I'll be really quick with this one. The Redmi 3S Prime is everything that the Redmi Note 3 is in terms of all-round performance -- which means it is crazy good -- without the overheating. The Redmi Note 3 is prone to some overheating. A new software update is said to have fixed the issue, somewhat. The Redmi 3S Prime doesn't heat up at all.. The Redmi 3S Prime is quick and responsive in every sense of the word. There are no visible lags or stutter while navigating between home screens and/or multitasking in our review unit. Remember, its speed and multitasking prowess are being compared with phones in this price range, which means phones like the Coolpad Note 3, the Meizu M3 Note and even the LeEco Le 1S. The Redmi 3S Prime beats all these phones in all-round usage, and nails even the Redmi Note 3 down because it doesn't heat up.. The Redmi 3S Prime is everything that the Redmi Note 3 is in terms of all-round performance -- which means it is crazy good -- without the overheating. Basic games are handled well, but GPU-intensive games are prone to some occasional lags when being played at maxed out settings for longer periods.. The mono speaker on-board the Redmi 3S Prime is average at best. It gets loud but there is often some digitisation observed at peak volume. Also, it's rear placement means sound is muffled when the phone is kept with the back facing down. Voice quality during calls made with the Redmi 3S Prime was excellent.. The Redmi 3S is backed by a 4,100mAh battery which is non-removable. The Redmi Note 3 and the Mi Max have set new standards in battery life in their respective price brackets. The Redmi 3S Prime with its 5-inch 720p display and heat-efficient processor follows suit. Xiaomi claims almost 2 days worth of battery life on this one. Moderate to extreme usage saw us cross the one whole day barrier with ease, while toning down further should get most users one and a half days out of the phone. Extreme usage scenarios got us close to 15 hours on the Redmi 3S Prime, which is kind of amazing. For your reference, the Redmi 3S Prime beats the Redmi Note 3 in battery output. Figures are more or less close to what you get on the Mi Max and that thing has a monster 4,850mAh battery.. The phone supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge but sadly it doesn't ship with a fast charger in the box which is kind of a bummer because charging that thing really takes a lot of time (over 2 hours) using a standard charger.. The Redmi 3S Prime sports a 13-megapixel camera on the rear with f/2.0 aperture, Phase-Detect Autofocus along with an LED flash. On the front you get a 5-megapixel snapper. Honestly, none of the new-age Xiaomi phones -- Mi 5, Redmi Note 3 -- have really impressed as far as camera performance is concerned. The Redmi 3S is more or less on similar lines, only overall, I feel it does a better job as compared to the Redmi Note 3. The Mi 5 still is the best Xiaomi camera phone right now.. The phone captures some good-looking photos in good light with good amount of detail and mostly spot-on (if a little oversaturated) colours. Dynamic range could have been better but then none of the camera phones at under Rs 10,000 have dynamic range to really brag about. The Redmi 3S is a tad better.. Xiaomi's phone is also able to capture well-enough photos in tricky light situations with good detail. Low light photos are prone to noise.. The front-facing selfie camera is just about average with some noise, even in good lighting.. The Redmi 3S Prime, in the grand scheme of things, is the best camera phone that you can buy right now in this price bracket without burning a hole in your pocket.. But the Redmi 3S Prime is here, and it's every bit as awesome as the phone that it replaces. It looks good, feels good, has a neat display, dependable performance, good-enough cameras and killer battery life. There's an even cheaper option in the standard Redmi 3S. You'll get lesser RAM (2GB), lesser storage (16GB) and no fingerprint scanner. But then, it also costs just Rs 6,999. Not bad, not bad at all..

Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime is a smaller, more budget friendly version of the Redmi Note 3. But more importantly this phone doesn’t compromise on battery life, just like its big brother.. And yes, Xiaomi is quick to point out this is a Made in India phone, from the box to the accessories. Like the bigger Redmi Note 3, Xiaomi is also launching the Redmi 3S in two versions in India: The cheaper version costs Rs 6,999 and has 2GB RAM+16GB storage, while the Rs 8,999 one is called the Redmi 3S Prime and comes with 3GB RAM, 32GB storage and a fingerprint sensor.. If 2015 was the year of phones with the Rs 6,999 price-tag, 2016 is all about Rs 9,999 as the coveted tag. Anyone who’s in the market for a new phone with a budget between Rs 8,999 to Rs 12,000,is likely to be confused. Should I spend Rs 2,000 more and get the 32GB version of a phone? Is the one with a bigger camera better? Do I need more RAM? These are all valid questions, especially if you are buying a smartphone with limited cash to spare, and want something that will at least last a whole year.. With the Redmi 3S, Xiaomi once again has new phones for under Rs 7,000 and Rs 9,000. The Chinese startup is hoping to cover all the price points in the budget category, and in a market like India where every penny matters, this is a strategy others are also following. So is the Redmi 3S/Redmi 3S Prime worth the hype? Is this the ideal budget phone you can buy in India right now? Here’s our review of the Redmi 3S Prime version.. Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime: Watch our video review. Redmi 3S Prime Specs: 5-inch HD display | Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 octa-core processor at 1.4 Ghz | 3GB RAM+32GB storage (expandable to 128 GB ) | 13 MP rear camera + 5 MP front camera | MIUI 7 on Android M | 4100 mAh battery. Redmi 3S Price: Rs 8,999 for 3GB RAM+ 32GB storage/ Rs 6,999 for 2GB RAM+16GB storage. Redmi 3S Prime/Redmi 3S is a smaller version of the Redmi Note 3, and yet you can’t help but wonder: How can this 5-inch phone have a slightly larger battery compared to the Note 3? (4100 vs 4050 mAh). The Redmi 3S shows it is possible to bring good design and specifications at a budget.. The full metal unibody design and frame on the side with the slightly curved back means the phone fits easily in your hand. The camera lens is on the left corner with the fingerprint scanner being bang in middle of the rear cover, and the speakers are also at the back. One look at the phone and you are likely to say: Redmi 3S Prime is a copy of the Redmi Note 3, which might not be such a bad thing for Xiaomi. It shows a certain standard across design, which has come to define the company’s products.. In my opinion, the design of the Redmi 3S also works in its favour. The phone is very light (weighs only 144 gms), which is close to what my iPhone 6s weighs, and yet this one packs a much bigger and better battery. The Redmi 3S shows it is possible to make a compact, yet good-looking device at a budget, that also happens to be made in India.. Battery, battery, battery: This phone is all about the 4,100 mAh battery that refuses to die. As we’ve noted in an earlier piece, Xiaomi is not the first company to introduce a big battery smartphone at a budget. Lenovo Vibe P1m for instance had a 3,900 mAh battery and was launched at a Rs 7,999 price in 2015.. In Xiaomi’s case, the battery lives up to the claims. In the GeekBench 3 battery test, the phone was still at 51 per cent seven hours into the test, and I was listening to music, getting notifications, etc on the phone. From what I’ve observed, most phones are down to 20 per cent if you run GeekBench for 7 straight hours.. In terms of real-life usage, I didn’t have to charge the Redmi 3S Prime at all during the weekend, and I made it my primary phone for browsing the internet, watching Netflix etc. At less than 20 per cent battery, I decided to start typing out a story on the phone (in the middle of the day), took some photos with it on an outing, and the phone didn’t die. I only put it to charge later in the evening when I got home with the battery at 1 per cent. For a phone with a Rs 8,999 price tag that’s impressive, I’d say.. For performance, Xiaomi sticks with the Qualcomm processors, and this is the first phone with a Qualcomm 430 processor in India. Sure this is not the fastest phone from Xiaomi’s stable, but the 3GB RAM variant has more than enough power to handle your daily needs. Multi-tasking was not a problem on this phone, and it can handle the graphics heavy games like Asphalt 8, Beach Buggy well, without any crashes or lag. The phone didn’t heat up significantly during gaming sessions either, which is another plus.. Camera on the Redmi 3S performs well in bright outdoors. The camera is fast and responsive and the colour reproduction is quite good. However, low-light performance is still an issue.. While I liked the pictures, the Redmi 3S gave in bright sunlight with blue skies in the back, its performance inside a room is not so good, or at least not as great as Xiaomi claims. The low-light photos still needs some work, and some of them look quite bad. So yeah, you might not always get great pictures while going out for dinner with family. However, that said, the price tag of this smartphone is under Rs 10,000 and it is still better than what other budget phones offer with their so-called 13-mp smartphone camera sensors.. The software issues with Xiaomi continue in this device as well. I could not run Antutu on this phone, because it would keep saying permissions were not granted, while MIUI7 insists they are; this is a problem I’ve faced on the Mi Max as well, and hopefully Xiaomi is working to fix these glitches with the MIUI8.. If you are in the market for a budget smartphone, and don’t have more than Rs 7,000 to spare, the Redmi 3S is without doubt one of the best options. It has a battery life that won’t die, 4G VoLTE support, and a much better performance than other phones in this price band.. Interestingly for prospective customers, the Redmi 3S Prime also poses a new dilemma. Should they get the Redmi Note 3 at Rs 9,999 and sacrifice the 32GB storage option? I’d say in case of the Redmi 3S Prime, the 5-inch HD display feels underwhelming, and this is especially true when you watch videos on the phone. I feel a user can just spend Rs 1000 extra, and get the Redmi Note 3, which has a much better display. Frankly it all depends on how flexible your budget is, because both the Redmi 3S Prime and Redmi Note 3 are solid options..

Share your thoughts with other customers. There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars Worth the money!!. I bought this product a few days back and trying to check everything to see if it is good enough product. I will give the pros and cons straight away for the time being I am using the phone, I'll update later if anything else pops up. Pros: 1) Battery: With 4000 mAH, this is the best thing about the phone. It lasted close to 50 hours (more than 2 days) on a single charge. 2) Design: Very ergonomic, with curved edges (also depends on which phone you were using earlier). The metallic body doesn't look cheap at all. 3) Fingerprint sensor: Very quick unlock. We get about 1.8 GB free after all the apps have been installed. In fact, the phone is quite fast. 5) Internal Memory: 32 GB, more than enough for me but it depends on your usage. I can easily manage in 32 GB and 2 sims. (You get about 24 GB free). Cons: 1) The battery is not removable. 2) Hybrid sim slot, which means we can use either a sim and a micro sd card or two sims. 3) The camera is decent, nothing to write home about. 4) Did get heat up a little bit while video chatting, playing games and charging. But I have been using for only a few days, battery seems to settle down after only a few charge cycles. 5) The screen did get a yellowish tan few times after unlocking with the fingerprint sensor. But it goes away after locking and unlocking again. I hope it's not a major thing to worry about. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Nothing gives value for money like this phone.. This is undoubtedly the best value for money entry level smart phone. Pros : - It's 720p display is gorgeous. - Has an entry level snapdragon processer. - The look and build of Phone is nothing to complain about and is in line with current style and look of smartphones. - They throw in a IR blaster, which is a bonus and of great use for those who will take advantage of this feature. (probably the reason the phone seems on thicker side, but not an issue) - the themes and customizations of MiUI are neat and beautiful and let you choose the look of the apps icons and they don't make the phone lag. - I don't think it misses out on any sensor or feature that an entry level smart phone would offer. Cons :- I really don't think there are any cons to point out when the phone offers so much. The Redmi phones have proved to be reliable entry level phones since the Redmi 1 iteration. You won't go wrong with the redmi 3s prime, and it's always safe to go for the one with higher RAM.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome Phone. Hello Friends, Phone is very hot and it have a powerfull 4100 mah battery, notification light, 13mp rear and 5mp front facing camera, IR blaster and 3.5mm jack on top, speaker's are good, touch response is good and it has 293 PPI, Charger can charge 0 to 100 in 2 hours. MRP is 8999 Rupees and I also got it for 8999 Rupees. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Good value. For Rs.9000, this phone is way too good. For some reason, this phone is a lot sturdier than other smartphones. I've dropped this countless number of times even on concrete. It's like I don't even move a muscle when I drop this phone. I kinda know it'll be alright. The camera is very very bad. But considering how awesome everything else is, and the Rs.9000 price tag, that's alright. It's unbelievable for a modern day smartphone. Most of the time, I charge every two days if I'm using it lightly. It lasts at least a day and a half if you use it lightly without gaming. The IR blaster is a nice touch. You only realize what an awesome feature when you lose a remote and want to control something.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Superb phone at this price. What you can get in 9k phone. But in 3s prime u almost get every feature. Looks wise phone doesn't seems demanding but feature wise it is. Performance is far better then my expectations. You can depend upon it for battery backup. For concluding I can say it's a value for money phone..

Purchased 2 Redmi phones for my family members. They have been using the phone for >6 months now. The first few months there was no problem per se with the phone. But after 3 months the problem started appearing. With one phone it was overheating coupled with call ending abruptly. With the other phone, it was a sound problem where-in harsh blaring sounds were coming from the speaker. Today 12/3/2017, I am just returning from a service center and the attitude of the service center staff was non-professional and rude. They said that the "only way to fix the speaker problem is to wipe off the data". So, if at all, please avoid buying Redmi phones. They might appeal to you for the low price, but in the long run it is not worth-it.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?.

Cell Phone Reviews Xiaomi Redmi 3s .... This smartphone is truly value for money.. Editor Rating: Excellent (4.5) Aug 09, 2016. Amazing build quality for the price. IR blaster is a neat addition. MIUI 7.5 doesn't support all Android Marshmallow features.. Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime ticks all the boxes and in no way it is a compromised phone. In many ways, even for a high-end smartphone user, it makes sense as the ultimate back-up phone.. The thing about budget smartphones is that they’re exactly that. Budget, cheap, under performing and what not. But Xiaomi’s Redmi 1S and Redmi 2 smartphones have defied that logic and have provided Indian users a holistic smartphone experience for an affordable price.. This year, the company has already launched the superb Redmi Note 3 which has taken the market by storm and now with the launch of Redmi 3S prime, Xiaomi could be the maker of possibly the best smartphone that one could dream up for less than Rs 10,000. The most striking thing about the Redmi 3S Prime is its size and design. This is works on two accounts. For a phone that costs less than Rs 10,000, it is shockingly well built; clad mostly in metal.. Secondly, it is also a very well designed smartphone with great ergonomics and feels innately compact especially for a phone of its size. Just for the sake of some context, it feels more compact than a phone like the iPhone 6S despite having a larger screen.. Purely in terms of thickness too, the phone measures in at 8.5mm and weighs a cool 144 grams. More than this, from the back, the phone swoops upwards from the sides, which lends it a curve on the sides that enhances the ergonomics of the phone. The overall result is a phone which is very easy to use – even with a single hand and also a phone which is superbly built irrespective of its price.. Xiaomi has also managed cram in a massive 4,100mAh battery in the device which is just insane considering its size. The company did a very similar thing with the Redmi Note 3.. In fact, for many, it will feel like a smaller version of the Redmi Note 3, but considering that was a great phone, this is high praise. Like the Redmi Note 3, it also houses them, fingerprint scanner on the back below the rear camera module. The display too is actually a very nice one. Yes, it has a HD resolution which isn’t groundbreaking, but the colours pop out a lot, the viewing angles are impressive and its brightness levels are so usable that we never had issues using the device under direct sunlight.. Xiaomi also says that it is using a type of protective glass on the lines of Corning’s Gorilla Glass, but they don’t point out the manufacturer of it.. The phone also incorporates an IR blaster on the front which is a feature that’s not often found in phones leave alone phones of this price.. The interesting thing about the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime is that it is the first phone to be launched in India with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor.. In fact, we haven’t till date seen a phone using this processor in action. According to Xiaomi India’s Jai Mani, this processor is faster and more efficient than the Snapdragon 615 processor but with a much better GPU.. And truth be told, he’s dead right because the 8-core Snapdragon 430 makes sure that the Redmi 3S Prime is plenty snappy. Of course, it helps that the phone also packs 3GB RAM and 32GB of onboard storage along with a rather clean and simple to use Mi UI which is based on Android Marshmallow. It is also a phone which can support an microSD card slot through the hybrid SIM slot.. The big take away is that you wouldn’t find much of difference in the performance of the Redmi 3S Prime and the Redmi Note 3 if you’re not a power user. In fact, it will be so negligible that most will not even notice it.. Make no mistake, this phone is going to be quite quick when it comes down to switching apps, multitasking and using basic apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Gmail and Instagram. It also holds its own pretty well while gaming.. It can run games like Dead Trigger 2 without any major frame rate issues while maintaining decent quality graphics and good levels of heat management. Synthetic benchmarks also paint a similar story.. The phone managed to work decently on a Vodafone connection in Delhi NCR. Call quality was pretty reliable subject to network. As it is a 4G phone with VoLTE support we expect it to be futureproof. It also has one of the fastest and most reliable fingerprint scanners in a phone. It is on the same level as the Google Nexus 6P and the OnePlus 3.. The most impressive thing, however, is its battery life. The Redmi 3S Prime will knock the socks out of most smartphones when it comes to battery life. Its 4,100mAh battery lasted us in-excess of 40 hours every time we drained on from a full charge.. Usage was sporadic – but always medium to heavy. The only drawback of the massive battery was that it took us hours to charge it fully. But all things considered, its battery life is so good that it runs circles around not one but two iPhones so that trade-off is quite palatable.. The Redmi 3S Prime comes with a 13-megapixel camera with an f/2.0 aperture and a phase detect autofocus system. There’s also a 5-megapixel snapper on the front.. Again, even in this area, the phone out performs the competition by a country mile. The phone takes surprisingly good photos that are sharp, with good levels of contrast and relatively real colours. This is true for daylight and night time shots.. The selfie camera is also pretty decent as long as there is adequate lighting. Similarly, videos shot from the rear camera are quiet good, with decent levels of audio even in loud conditions. Stabilization, however, isn’t that good, but then one can’t expect the moon from a phone that costs Rs 8,999.. The cameras can be described as highly usable and class leaders, but they still aren’t meant for the ardent shutterbug.. The big takeaway out here is that the Redmi 3S Prime is the very definition of what we call a ‘paisa vasool’ smartphone. It ticks all the boxes and in no way it is a compromised phone.. In fact, it is a phone that even an iPhone user will enjoy using which is mighty high praise for a phone that just costs Rs 8,999. In many ways, even for a high-end smartphone user, it makes sense as the ultimate back-up phone.

As the competition progressively gets tougher in the Indian smartphone space, we’re increasingly seeing Xiaomi get more aggressive. Not just on price but also with the frequency of launches, the company wants to retain and enhance its foothold in the bread and butter, sub 10,000 rupee market. As millions of Indians start buying their first smartphones, it is this very segment where most manufacturers are hankering to grab a piece of the pie. We’ve had our hands on the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime for a couple of days now and here’s our review.. Xiaomi Redmi 3S / Redmi 3S Prime specifications. The Redmi 3S follows a design language that is nigh identical to that on the Redmi Note 3. Shrink down the latter a little bit and you’ve got the Redmi 3S. Can’t really complain about that either since the design isn’t quite. the eyesore though it errs on the side of utilitarian.. The front of the phone is dominated by the 5inch display that is flanked on all sides by bezels. you have three capacitive keys that correspond to menu, home and back. This is rather typical of the company’s phones. The bezels on the side of the display are relatively narrow and don’t detract from the experience. Up top is a 5MP front facing camera with the earpiece placed next to it. A metallic band runs all around the front of the phone that prevents the phone from laying flat on a surface and the screen getting scratched. The phone does have some sort of protective glass on top but the company refused to divulge what kind it is. Suffice to say that you should probably look at investing in a good screen protector for your device.. The power button and volume rocker is placed on the right hand side. The power button is on the mushier side but is ergonomically placed to be easily reachable. The volume rocker on the other hand is a single non-segmented button that we are personally not too fond of but this isn’t really an issue in day-to-day usage. Over on the left is a hybrid SIM card slot that can house two nano SIM cards or a single SIM alongside a microSD card. At the top is a 3.5mm audio jack alongside an IR blaster that can be used for controlling a range of consumer electronics via the built-in Mi Remote app. The phone charges over a microUSB port placed at the bottom.. The back of the phone is a very clean affair and the only branding is just a silk-screened Mi logo towards the bottom. The handset is being manufactured in India and says so at the bottom. Up above is the fingerprint scanner while the camera module and its accompanying flash is placed at the top left corner. It is worth noting that only the Prime variant ie the 3GB / 32GB storage variant comes with a fingerprint scanner.. The dimensions of the Redmi 3S come in at. 139.3 x 69.6 x 8.5mm and with a weight of 144 grams, the phone is pretty compact. From an ergonomics perspective, the smaller 5 inch display on the Redmi 3S makes it feel. really good in the hand, and manages to fit well even in tight pockets. It might not be the smartest. looking device around but it sure is a very comfortable device to use.. If you’ve used a Xiaomi device, you have a good idea of how MIUI works. Based on Android 6.0.1, MIUI 7 on the Redmi 3S is a completely redesigned take on Android with several iPhone-esque cues all around.. The lockscreen is a clean affair with a clock up top and notifications taking over as necessary. You can switch out the wallpapers using a built-in tool that can be activated right from the lockscreen. Enter the homescreen and you’ll notice that the phone eschews the two level hierarchy common on Android devices. There is no separate app drawer here and all apps are placed straight on the homescreen itself. A shortcut tray lies at the bottom.. There’s a fair few preinstalled apps on board that come part of the MIUI offering. For the most part these add utility to the experience but if you want a clean software experience, you’re probably going to be disappointed by the device. There are a couple of bundled apps like those for Amazon, Facebook, Flipkart, Swiftkey and WPS Office. It is possible to uninstall these.. There’s a Snapdragon 430 processor onboard the handset that includes an Adreno 505 GPU.. The Snapdragon 430 might not be. the de-facto choice from a performance perspective but what it does offer is a great balance between usability and battery life. Indeed, in day-to-day use you’ll struggle to find a skipped frame or a hint of lag. The 720p display further helps in this regard by going easy on the GPU. Though the phone will be available in both 2GB and 3GB variants, we’d recommend sticking to the higher end variant that we’ve been testing unless you really don’t want to spend the extra amount. Even with games, the performance was satisfactorily smooth though we did observe a mild amount of heating near the camera. We’ve included a number of benchmarks below to give you a better idea of comparative performance.. In Basemark OS II, the phone scores 848 points which places it around the middle of our test bench.. In 3D Mark Ice Storm which measures GPU performance, the phone scores 9401 points which places it in the upper half of the test bench but is half of what the Redmi Note 3 Pro scores.. In the Geekbench 3 Single Core benchmark, the phone scores just 676 points.. In the Geekbench 3 Multi-Core benchmark, the phone scores 2888 points.. Sacrifices have to be made when developing a device as affordable as the Redmi 3S. The display is usually amongst the first to suffer and that’s true to an extent here too. We found the contrast levels to be below average because of which the phone isn’t the best device around for multimedia consumption. The color rendition tends to err towards a more natural tone.. Brightness levels on the Redmi 3S go quite high, sufficient enough to facilitate viewing outdoors. While we certainly wouldn’t mind it if the display went brighter still, we’d be nitpicking if we found this to be a concern. Viewing angles too are decent enough though there is a slight color shift when watching from extreme angles. The 5 inch display with a 720p resolution offers a pixel density of 293ppi.. The Redmi 3S has a 13MP rear facing camera module with phase detection auto focus (PDAF) built-in to speed up the focussing process. In addition, there’s a 5MP front facing camera module.. The camera module performs well in decent lighting though it tends to blow out the highlights. Dynamic range is relatively limited as there is a loss details in the shadow region.. For the most part, we were satisfied with shots from the Redmi 3S especially given the target price point. In low light conditions, the image quality predictably drops as photos become softer and noise levels creep up.. The Redmi 3S comes well equipped in terms of connectivity options including. 4G LTE, VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS and GLONASS. There’s a built-in IR blaster as well as we mentioned earlier. The phone has 32GB of storage built-in of which about 24GB is available at launch. You can expand this via the microSD card slot though you’ll have to sacrifice a SIM slot for that privilege.. With a battery rated for over 4,000 mAh you’d expect the Redmi 3S to last long. Add on top the frugal hardware and the small-ish, 720p screen and you’ve got the makings of a very efficient handset. In our testing, even when we pushed the handset really hard it was impossible for us to deplete it in a day of use. More often than not, we got about two full days of usage out of the Redmi 3S. If battery life is something that concerns you often, then rest assured that it is something you definitely won’t have to worry about with this device.. At a price point of Rs. 8,999, the Redmi 3S Prime represents tremendous value for money. Yes, the display isn’t the best around and the camera could be a bit better but they. are far from the worst in the category. Moreover, performance for day-to-day use is good enough and the battery life is phenomenal. You’d be well served by stepping up to the Prime variant of the Redmi 3S for the additional RAM, storage and the very useful fingerprint scanner. deem the Redmi 3S to be a solid competitor to the likes of the Coolpad Note 3 Lite and others in the category..

Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime review – Batman’s Robin. By Gogi Rana on August 13, 2016 96 Comments. Antutu (64 bit) – 42150 | 3D score – 7435. Internal storage Speed – Read (134MB/s), Write (82MB/s). How to use Redmi 3S Prime for monitoring fitness activities. Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime Battery Performance (time / battery % drop / estimated battery temperature). Running Benchmark app – 9 minutes / 2% / 36 degrees. Asphalt 8 + MC5 game play – 32 minutes / 6% / 37 degrees. FHD video playback with full brightness (WiFi /4G on) – 36 minutes / 6% / 36 degrees. Does Redmi 3S prime support fast charging?. FHD video shot using the Redmi 3S Prime handset. Xiaomi launched the Redmi 3S and the Redmi 3S prime in India. This is the Redmi 3S Prime review, there is not much of a difference between the Redmi 3S and the 3S Prime, apart from the price, RAM/ROM and fingerprint sensor.. Inside the box you will find the handset, SIM tray ejector pin, data cable, user guide, warranty card and travel charger (5V/2A). SAR value : 0.617W/Kg (head) and 0.429W/Kg (body).. The Redmi 3S / Prime is a small handset that will fit really well in most palms and is very comfortable to use. Those who are looking for handset with a 5 inch screen, for them 3S is a great option. This handset is packed inside a metal body, very good build and finishing, curvy design that gives a good grip and feels great. Redmi 3S weight is 145 grams with battery and dimensions are 69.34 x 139.11 x 8.36 (mm).. This is a dual SIM handset you can either use a micro SIM + Nano SIM or micro SIM + micro SD card.. Screen is 5 inches supporting 1280 x 720 pixels resolution. Color reproduction, viewing angles and touch response are just great. It is not mentioned if the screen comes with any protection, but screen is scratch resistant to some minor extent. If you have a history of damaging screen then it would be better if you use a screen guard.. There is LED notification below the dedicated button on the front and you can select a color from the list. The dedicated button do not light up. This handset is packed with Accelerometer, gyro, magnetic, hall, step, light and proximity sensors.. Redmi 3S / 3S prime is running MIUI 7 based on Android Marshmallow 6.0.1.. Now depending on the model – on 3S you get 2GB RAM and 16GB eMMC 5.0 ROM. On the 3S Prime there is 3GB RAM and 32GB eMMC 5.1 ROM. On the first boot (3S Prime) you will get around 1.9GB free RAM and around 22 GB free space. User can use micro SD card of up to 128GB.. This handset houses the qualcomm snapdragon 430 1.4GHz octa core processor – 64 bit coupled with Adreno 505 GPU. Performance was smooth and lag free. In general as well as when playing games the handset performance will impress you and it hardly heats up (max temp I encountered was 37 degrees).. I tried MC5 (Modern Combat 5) and Asphalt 8 – both these games worked great, buttery smooth performance – check video review.. On the back there is a 13MP PDAF camera with f/2.0 aperture, it can shoot FHD videos. Front facing camera is a 5MP shooter. Camera quality is above average check the sample images and video at the end of this review.. The Redmi 3S / 3S Prime supports 4G LTE with VoLTE. Sound (speaker / in-call) is loud and clear. I did not face any network issues. 4G, WiFi, GPS and Bluetooth worked well.. There is IR blaster on the front you can use that to control other electronic items like AC, TV etc. The finger print sensor on the back is also pretty fast and accurate. You can unlock directly using finger print sensor, just tap the sensor.. There is built in step counter, just download the Mi Fit app and this smartphone will monitor your physical activities without the need of any fitness (wearable) device. It will count the steps only, but if you are interested in monitoring your heart rate, sleep you will need to buy the Mi band wearable. But yes this handset can count your basic steps right out of the box.. Another unique thing about the 3S is the 4100 mAh battery that comes built in. One would easily get up to 2 days of battery life with mixed usage. As per my test results you can expect 7 to 10 hours of non-stop moderate to heavy usage.. It took me 3 hour 22 minutes to charge the handset using wall charger from 5% to 100%.. I tried a fast charger max 9V/2A it took 1 hour 56 minutes to charge from 43% to 100%. In general using fast charger did not help, it was a bit faster than using the standard travel charger, but the difference does not qualify. Normal charger 3 hours 22 minutes for 5% to 100%, when using fast charger estimated 2:45 to 3:00 hours from 5% to 100%.. The Redmi 3S Prime no doubt is a very good handset with a very good price tag, however it does not come with fast charging support and the Snapdragon 430 hardware is not as powerful as the Snapdragon 650 that Redmi Note 3 is using.. Redmi 3S prime cannot play 4K videos smoothly, Redmi Note 3 can. Also when you compare the benchmarks there is a good difference. Having said that the 3S is still a very good buy, you will hardly notice any difference in performance with you daily usage though technically Note 3 is powerful.. The only criteria when deciding between the Redmi 3S and the Redmi Note 3 should be the screen size – you decide if you want a handset with 5 inch screen or 5.5 inch screen. 3S is Batman’s robin (Batman = Redmi Note 3).. There is not much off a price difference between the 3S Prime and the Note 3 (2GB), makes sense to go for Redmi Note 3, however the Redmi 3S without finger print sensor for Rs. 6,999 is excellent buy in case you ignore the finger print sensor..

July 19, 2017 at 10:34 am. I am using Redmi 3s from 9 months and currently facing an issue. Please provide your opinion, if possible. In file explorer, I found that the Available storage 838 MB out of 10.64 GB.. This phone has 2GB RAM and 16GB ROM. I can understand that the the around 5GB is used by the system.. The issue is I am getting the “The storage running out” kinda notifications to clear the data. I am always curious to see that I don’t keep unnecessary data in the phone and still why the errors occur.. Now, I calculated the total amount of storage in the File explorer and found that it has around 3GB data. Then why the storage is not enough error is occurs and why the file explorer (default app) shows only 838 MB availability.. July 19, 2017 at 10:41 am. Rahul, check camera folder see if there are many images / videos you would want to move all / some to your PC or other storage. Also remove apps that you are not using.. July 19, 2017 at 10:52 am. As you know that I am using redmi 3s and want to upgrade to the Redmi 4. Is it a wise decision and should I wait?. I am getting offers for the redmi 3s. Some buyers are ready to buy it at Rs. July 19, 2017 at 10:56 am. Then sell off 3S and go ahead with Redmi 4 it is the best in the price and in terms of Performance. Check this review here https://www.gogi.in/redmi-4-review-budget-premium-smartphone.html. If you have used 3s you will be very much impressed with Redmi 4 also looking at the space issue you are facing with 3S, I would suggest you go with more internal storage than what you used on your Redmi 3s. There are RAM/ROM options available on Redmi 4 look for ROM as per your need (ignore RAM).. July 19, 2017 at 12:02 pm. I will sell the Redmi 3s. I found the storage issue solution. In system hidden files there are some blob.1 type of files which took around 1 GB size. I deleted them and did free around 2 GB storage.. July 19, 2017 at 12:05 pm. Cool, if the space was enough on 3s you can go with the same space on Redmi 4 too.. May 5, 2017 at 12:34 am. 3s Prime, Bought 1 month back.

Gogi Bro, My friend bought redmi 3s 2 days before after go through your review, after installed basic applications like fb,whastapp etc, it shows available ram only 7.8 out of 16 gb ram. February 28, 2017 at 11:04 am. 16GB is ROM not RAM, still lot of space don’t worry continue using.. February 28, 2017 at 11:30 am. Mentioned wrongly as ram instead of rom, any how wow, what a lightning reply, really i didn’t expect, thank you very much brother. now my doubt cleared by your answer – thanks.. February 28, 2017 at 11:23 am. It’s really frustrating in redmi 3s, you used it one month and see the internal memory less than 1gb for sure as I facing, no app transferable to memory card, hybrid sim, without gorilla glass, without any resist levels of water, many things which are missing & all that make you cry after some time..Price & good battery backup 3s otherwise so called headache. Moto e3 power somewhere better than this even lesser updates.. Peace of mind lastly all have to want.. February 28, 2017 at 12:23 pm. Rahul, your comment making my stomach trouble, had i taken a wrong decision?. February 19, 2017 at 10:07 pm. Sir which phone is better in Redmi 3s prime and lenovo k6 power ??. February 10, 2017 at 4:21 pm. The phone is heating up as most of the metal android devices with 4g on and some half an hour of gaming means your device will have a temp of around 42 43 degree Celsius in low/medium brightness.. And I have a question is Redmi Note 4 a heater like this?. January 7, 2017 at 4:54 pm. Hi, Gogi which phone is better in camera, gaming, performance – coolpad mega 2.5D or redmi 3s?.
