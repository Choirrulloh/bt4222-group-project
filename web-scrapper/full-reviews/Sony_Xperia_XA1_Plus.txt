CNET también está disponible en español.. Sony's Xperia XA1 Plus leads with a beefy battery. The midrange Android phone has an attractive metal body and a 23-megapixel camera.. by August 31, 2017 4:15 AM PDT. A big battery and a blue shell: Check out Sony's XA1 Plus. Sony's new phones are all about the cameras. Sony Xperia XA1 Plus specs: 5.5-inch display Full HD (1,920x1080-pixel) resolution 23-megapixel camera 3,430mAh battery. Fingerprint sensor on the power button (only on UK phones ) 8-megapixel front-facing camera Android Nougat software USB-C charging. Sony's midrange XA1 Plus is full of big numbers, from its large 5.5-inch display to its 23-megapixel camera. Inside is a capacious 3,430mAh battery that should easily keep this going for a full day of use.. The screen is full HD (1,920x1080 pixels) which should help eke out the juice too -- that 4K display in Sony's top-end XZ Premium is a real power hog. It still seemed sharp enough for all your essentials and bright enough to use outdoors.. The phone is wrapped in a metal shell which looks quite pretty, but it doesn't have any kind of waterproofing. That's disappoining, given that waterproofing is something we're seeing more and more on smartphones -- including many of Sony's own handsets. Be careful around water with this one.. Sony hasn't yet announced pricing for the phone but it's due to go on sale globally later in September so we'll hear more in the coming weeks.. CNET earns fees when you click these offers..

Yes No. 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful. By Iniyan Gnanasekar | 19 Oct 2017. This is my review after 1 week. Superb budget phone from Sony with this specs for the first time. Merits:battery capacity 3430 mah increased by sony. Fingerprint scanner on side with the power button which is a advantage from Sony budget phone. But sony told that it will be upgradable to oreo in last December or January first. Selfie camera :8mp with 23mm wide angle sensor for group selfies. In lighting conditions pics looks awesome no blur nd all. But in low lights not much impressive. Music:Sony is named for its audio quality. No music player can match its quality. Demerits :mediatek hello p20 processor which is an average processor for this price. But performance is very good nd no lag in this phone. So my final point is camera and musiq lovers who wants a phone with NYC build quality with a brand. You can just go blindly with this phone. And also it's weight is 190g but this phone doesn't look bulky. Choose blue color which attracts the people. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.

What is a hands on review?. The Xperia XA1 Plus looks to be a solid smartphone offering, with a large screen that's well suited to video playback and gaming, and a battery that should keep you going all day.. Not the comfiest in the hand. Large bezels above and below the screen. Hands-on with Sony's new flagship duo: Xperia XZ1 | Xperia XZ1 Compact Design and display Battery and camera Early verdict All the latest news, launches and first looks from IFA 2017 in Berlin. The Sony Xperia XA1 Plus is being pitched as a ‘super mid-tier smartphone’, as it slides in above the Xperia XA1 and below the Xperia XA1 Ultra in Sony’s slightly confusing middle-market range.. Its main talking points are the 5.5-inch Full HD display and sizeable 3,430mAh battery, although Sony has offered up little else in terms of specs for this handset so far.. While the ‘super mid-tier’ tag suggests an affordable price point for the XA1 Plus, Sony is yet to confirm its price, and there’s currently no word on its availability around most of the world either, although we do know it'll be on sale from the autumn in the UK.. We’ll be getting to grips with the XA1 Plus in more detail during IFA 2017 in Berlin, so check back here for our updated thoughts later this week.. In terms of design the Sony Xperia XA1 Plus inherits the same look and feel as the firm’s handsets from the past few years.. That means you’re looking at sizeable bezels above and below the 5.5-inch Full HD display, with the squared-off design of old now a little more rounded on each side, making it easy to hold in the hand.. The flat rear means it still isn’t the comfiest fit in the palm, but it’s just about manageable for one-handed use – assuming you have big hands.. Sony’s side-mounted power key resides in the center of the right side, with a volume rocker switch just above and a dedicated camera shutter key towards the base.. The power key also incorporates the fingerprint scanner, giving you some biometric security, although if this phone makes it to the US it’ll likely not come with a digit reader, as Sony tends to drop the feature in that particular market.. On the opposite edge a flap covers the SIM and microSD card ports. We’re still waiting to find out the power and storage the XA1 Plus packs, but we do know it’ll run Android Nougat out the box, rather than the newer Android Oreo .. In terms of colors, you'll be able to choose from white or black in the UK, with the blue hue we got hands-on with apparently not getting a British airing.. General navigation around the handset was smooth enough, and looking at the two other XA1 devices in the range we expect it to have at least 3GB of RAM paired with its MediaTek Helio P20 octa-core processor.. Sony Xperia XA1 Plus hands-on gallery. The Xperia XA1 Plus has a promising-looking battery on paper, with a 3,430mAh power pack crammed into its body.. That’s bigger than the 2,700mAh offering in the Xperia XZ1 and XZ1 Compact that launched alongside the XA1 Plus at IFA 2107, and we hope it’ll comfortably last a full day on a single charge. We’ll be sure to put it through its paces during our in-depth review in the coming weeks.. Round the back the XA1 Plus boasts Sony’s 23MP camera, the same snapper found on its two XA1 siblings, and which on those handsets delivers a solid photography experience – although we have found that it can be a little hit and miss at times.. During our brief time with the phone we found the camera to be quick and responsive, and pictures were generally acceptable, although you’ll have to wait for our full review for the final verdict.. The dedicated physical shutter key on the side is certainly useful considering the size of the handset, making it easier to snap photos and grab the odd sly selfie from the 8MP front-facing camera.. The Sony Xperia XA1 Plus looks to be a solid smartphone, with a large screen that's well suited to video playback and gaming, and a battery that should keep you going all day.. We're reserving proper judgement until we've spent more time with the handset, seen the full spec sheet and found out the price – but it's so far, so good.. IFA 2017 is Europe's biggest tech show.

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Sony took the wraps off of a slew of new smartphone offerings here at IFA 2017 , and while the flagship Xperia XZ1 and Xperia XZ1 Compact definitely stole the limelight, the new addition to their mid-range line is definitely deserving of some attention as well. We go hands on and take a quick look at the Sony Xperia XA1 Plus!. Sony launched the Xperia XA1 and Xperia XA1 Ultra. back during MWC earlier this year, and as far as specifications and features go, the new Xperia XA1 Plus falls right in the middle of the two. Sony’s signature design returns here, with the XA1 Plus featuring a metal build with rounded corners and a flat top and bottom.. The bezels are impressively thin along the sides of the display, but the top and bottom chin are really thick and feel almost unnecessarily at this point. While Sony may be keeping them in order to maintain its signature design, at a time when the industry as a whole is moving on to higher and higher screen-to-body ratios they look incredibly dated.. At the very least, the extra space isn’t entirely a waste and is home to a dual front-facing speaker setup.. As mentioned, the XA1 Plus falls smack in the middle of its older siblings, and that starts with the size. While the XA1 and XA1 Ultra featured 5-inch and 6-inch displays respectively, the XA1 Plus comes with a 5.5-inch IPS LCD screen with a Full HD resolution. As was the case with the other two, this display also hits 100% of the sRGB color gamut.. Like the other two devices in the series, the XA1 Plus is also powered by a Mediatek Helio P20 processor, and comes with 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of built-in storage that is further expandable via microSD card up to an additional 256 GB. As has always been the case with Sony’s smartphones, the US version of the XA1 Plus will not feature a fingerprint scanner, but it will be available in the European edition of the phone. You do get to take advantage of an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance however.. Things also remain identical in the camera department, with the XA1 Plus featuring a 23 MP rear shooter with a f/2.0 aperture. Up front is an 8 MP shooter though, which is better than what was available with the XA1, but not as good as the one found with the XA1 Ultra. Given that the main camera is the same, the camera performance of the XA1 Plus should impress the same way the others did, but we’ll definitely need to test it more before drawing any conclusions.. The one department that has received a much needed boost is in the battery, with the XA1 Plus packing in a battery that is larger than both of its siblings with its 3,430 mAh unit. With Qnovo Adaptive Charging and the Pump Express 2.0 fast charging technology on-board, you shouldn’t have a lot of trouble getting that large battery back to a full charge either.. On the software side of things, the Xperia XA1 Plus is running Android 7.1.2 Nougat , with Sony’s minimalistic UI on top. Sony has always done a great job of keeping the software experience as close to and as fast as stock Android, while still being aesthetically different enough to be its own thing. And of course, you do get Sony’s own set of apps on-board that help further enhance the experience.. So, there you have it for this quick hands on with the Sony Xperia XA1 Plus! While there are minor differences between the three smartphones in the XA1 series, what it essentially boils down to is your size preference. If you found the 5-inch XA1 to be too small and the 6-inch XA1 Ultra to be too big, the middle of the ground XA1 Plus may be the one that is best suited for you.. Please enter a valid email address.

Fingerprint sensor (outside the US), single bottom-firing loudspeaker, 3.5mm jack, dedicated two-stage hardware shutter release button. No stereo speakers on a phone that's clearly intended for multimedia use. Fingerprint sensor not available in the US. Doesn't launch with the latest Android. Should we mention the bezels? Oops, we just did.. So, what if one Xperia isn't big enough but the other is a tad too much? Well, you come up with something in the middle. Enter the 5.5" Xperia XA1 Plus, which is perfectly bridging the gap between the 5-inch XA1 and the 6-inch XA1 Ultra.. The Xperia XA1 Plus bridges other gaps too, though. For one, it's got a fingerprint reader on the side, just like on the higher-end XZ series, while the XA1 and the Ultra sacrificed that for minimal side bezels.. And just because the screen diagonal of the Plus is the mean of the other two, it doesn't imply the battery capacity is thereabout too. Oh no, the XA1 Plus boasts a plus-size battery. The 3,430mAh capacity of the Plus is 27% more than what the 6-inch Ultra has. Couple that with the efficient 16nm Helio P20 chipset and you're in for some excellent endurance numbers.. There are no surprises to be expected in the camera department. The XA1 Plus shares the primary cam with the other two: there's a high-res 23MP large sensor unit inherited from last generation's flagships. As for selfies, it's the XA1's 8MP cam that you'll find on the Plus, and not the Ultra's 16MP shooter. All the rest is very much in line with the other XA1s, but you can always refer to the next few lines for a quick refresher.. While we do welcome the introduction of the fingerprint sensor, it's still not available in the US. Yes, Sony's bound by contracts signed in the past to not use the technology stateside and that's that for as long as the agreements stipulate. We guess it's really a matter of accepting the fact.. Stereo speakers, however, are entirely up to Sony, and they're still missing on the XA1 Plus. Their absence on the larger Ultra is more baffling, but the Plus could have benefited from a pair of speakers just as well. Seems like there's plenty of room with those bezels, no?. There'll be more to say on bezels when we round up the hardware on the following page, but we'll kick it off in our usual fashion with the unboxing first.

Rated 5 out of. Great Phone, Good Design, Good Specs. A very nice, shiny, sleek, and good phone. I like Sony's square design with its nice sharpish corners, although I would have liked it more if the sides were not curved but flat instead, giving it a more square finish, but very nice.. The box does not come sealed. So, you cant really tell if the phone is actually brand new or refurbished. (from experience, with a refurbished phone the least you'll likely to notice is the screen protector has been stripped off). The phone is slim and sleek. It has a heavy weighted feel (but it doesnt feel expensvie or it doesnt have a premium feel like the XZ Premium). It feels like the top is made of real glass, which i am afraid to drop and break if it is. It is sleek and shiny with a nice smooth feel even on the back although the back is a matt finish. I havent noticed if it is a fingerprint magnet, which is good.. The finishing is so good, nice and shiny that when you look at a dark website or the phone with its standard black wallpaper when its sunny its only as good as a mirror.. I was gonna buy the XZ Premium which although is the same size 5.5 inches, it feels much bigger and flatter in the hand when you hold it but the battery life on that one is only 4-5 hours - what am I gonna do with 4-5 hours of battery life when I am constantly out and about and these days phones dont come with replacable batteries.. Anyway, the SE XA1 Plus is a mid-range size phone of 5.5 inches accross diagonally (corner-to-corner). Now that i have got the phone, it doesnt feels so much big even though it is. Compared to the XZ Premium its looks like the phone is more taller in terms of size rather than being 5.5 inches equally all over. I feel like getting the XA1 Ultra which is 6 inches but I already have a problem so I dont think I will be doing that. The 5.5 inch XA1 Plus fits tightly into my coat pocket and I had a little struggle getting it out. It fits perfectly in my trouser pocket (not jeans) with just a little bit of the corner exposed so, i guess if i got the 6 incher it wouldnt fit in my coat pocket on the side or in the trouser pocket; unless you have big square pockets. Also, since this a bigger phone than my last phone which was 4.5 inches and iphone 6s is more smaller at 4.7 inches you have check if your phone is still there in your trouser pocket or has it fallen out.. I heard lot of people complain about the bezels but I dont mind becuase it gives me a place to hold the phone rather than block areas of viewing area on the screen when using the phone horizontally to play games or watching video.. When using the phone horizontally to play games its easy block the speakers with your fingers. The sound isnt always good, at times it can be slow even if you put the volume upto max but at other times it is ok.. To get back your full 32gb of internal storage back you definately need a microSDcard of reasonable size.. The sim-tray is a bit flimsy. If you're likely to change sim-cards often, there is a possiblity it could damage. The sim tray also does not have any locking mechanism to place the sim on the tray and lock it like other phones which doesnt seem secure as the sim(s) could fall out when putting it in. If you just drop the sim card in or place them on the tray, when you push the tray in, it wont close properly or the sim will try to pop out and get stuck when closing the sim tray so you have to hold down the card(s) with your finger and push the tray in. When inserting double sim cards it feels like there is somthing getting stuck inside or it might not come out again when pushing the tray in. Again, this is because there is no mechanism like other phones to lock the sim in place.. Another thing is, when you're not using the phone there is low network signal. I have connected my wifi and so far it is fine with no problems.. The phone does not come with a fast charger although you can get one. Without a fast charger its takes 3 hours and 20 minutes for a full charge, but if it does last 2 days like it says then theres no problem unless you are a heavy user.. Battery was charged at 72% out of the box (I wonder if someone used it or if it is refurbished), and lasted 12 hours and 15 minute doing everyday routines things such as chatting on WhatsApp, social media, youtube, browsing and 3D gaming. I'm not a heavy user neither am I a light user but I sure am a moderate user of all these things.. Sony has made a very nice phone, all their phones are a nice square design which I like very much however, what I dont like is the design of the round icons.. The camera is very good with crystal clear pictures with both the rear cam and the front selfie-cam although its not very good in poor light.. The notification LED is flashes green instead of blue or amber as in other phones. The price of the phone is a bit expensive. If you read the technical details you can read so much about it but when it comes to using a phone you wouldn't really be thinking whats under the hood and about all the those details, so this price range is irrelevant.. The phone runs nice and smoothly on 3Gb or RAM but not smooth and fast as an iphone 6s.. Althought the storage space is 32gb 11.11gb has been taken by the the OS Noughat and bloatware by Sony so, we only have 20.89gb for use.. Overall, its a nice good phone, haven't had any problems so far, which is good.. If you find cheper deal than ours,We'll match it and pay your first monthly bill..

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features Object tracking, Digital image stabilization, Touch to focus, Smile detection, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging.

Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Octa-core, 2300 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 16 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time 21.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min).

Source: Unbox Hereâs to hoping that the Japanese company makes all the right moves to really one-up the competition, but the Sony Xperia XA1 Plus is definitely a solid mid-range device and a huge step in the right direction. Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 11/27/2017. Sony Xperia XA1 Plus Review Source: Yugatech The Sony Xperia XA1 Plus proves that it can go toe-to-toe with todayâs standard of new smartphones. Aside from its solid build quality and simple yet premium design, the Xperia XA1 Plus has a decent overall performance, a long-lasting battery life, and good camera quality. Heat management from the device is fairly efficient. Personally, this is one of the recommended smartphones today that can be chosen as a mid-range device by users.

Source: Recombu The Xperia XA1 Plus certainly isnât a perfect mid-range mobile and itâs up against strong competition from the likes of the Moto G5s Plus and Samsungâs Galaxy A and J Series handsets.

Sony Xperia XA1 Plus review - An affordable entertainment phablet Source: Tech Nave I thought of comparing it with the Samsung Galaxy J7 Plus and Xiaomi Mi A1 , but those two smartphones are more focused on the camera aspect. So it seems like thereâs no competition, right? Wrong, thereâs still the ASUS ZenFone 4 Max Pro and Nokia 6 because they are packing big batteries inside, particularly the former with 5000mAh that can go for 5 days straight (read our review here), its cameras are better and it only costs RM979! The Nokia 6 has a 3000mAh battery which isnât bad, but as for performance we canât say much because we havenât reviewed it yet. Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 10/16/2017. 70% Sony Xperia XA1 Plus review Source: GSM Arena Crowd-favorite display size, a large battery, fingerprint reader straight from the higher-end models - seems like the Xperia XA1 Plus is the XA1 to have. Plus, it shares the other strong points of its immediate kin - the once-flagship 23MP camera does a fine job for stills, and the 16nm Helio P20 chipset strikes a great balance between performance and efficiency. If you want a midranger outside of Sony camp, there are plenty of options. Inside it - the Xperia XA1 Plus stands out.

Sony Xperia XA1 Plus hands-on review Source: GSM Arena Sure, it all comes down to personal taste and how much value you subjectively place on the fingerprint reader, but we just can't help but feel the XA1 Plus would have been a lot more smashing in any of its four shades (Black, Blue, Pink and Gold) if Sony had stuck with the already established XA1 look.

Single Review, online available, Medium, Date: 08/31/2017. Model : While the Sony Xperia XZ1 is the king of the hill on Sonyâs lineup, not everyone can or is willing to shell out for a flagship. Hence, Sony offers the Sony Xperia XA1 Plus further down its stack. If the XZ1 can be compared to a Rolls Royce, the XA1 Plus is akin to a Mercedes. This is not far off, since both are still considered premium devices albeit the latter has a way more affordable price without skimping on features. So, what is the Sony Xperia XA1 Plus rocking under its hood? It is powered by Mediatekâs P20 MT6757 SoC, 3 GB of RAM, and 32 GB of storage. Because Sony focuses on a very angular design, the XA1 remains as a daring contrast to the likes of Appleâs iPhone or even Samsungâs Galaxy series. This is welcome, since the market is increasingly made up of wannabe copycats, which frankly always falls flat on its face. Compared to Sonyâs own lineup the Xperia XA1 Plus is taller than most of its designs but is also equally. Hence, it feels like a chocolate bar. Despite that, the Xperia XA1 Plus is quite pleasant to hold. In terms of chassis design the Xperia XA1 Plus is primarily made of a mix of plastics and aluminium, which comes with the mid-range tier. However, it feels premium without feeling tacky or cheap. One thing the Xperia XA1 Plus has and the XZ does not is support for Dual SIM configurations although that is subject to region. On the IO side of things, the Xperia XA1 Plus is also equipped with a USB Type C port but compared to the XZ its only USB 2.0 which is downright disappointing. One thing to love about Sonyâs phones is that they are generally almost bloatware free. Software-wise it is preloaded with an almost stock Android Nougat 7.0, with a high probability of being able to update to Android Oreo 8.0.. In the camera department Sony has installed a 23 MP rear and 8 MP front camera. The 23 MP camera features a wide-angle lens. Quality-wise the camera delivers as expected. However, there seem to be minor issues such as heavy color noise in low light setups. Although 4K is supported by the onboard SoC, the Xperia XA1 Plus is only able to support up to 1080p. This is most likely a restriction Sony has implemented to keep 4K reserved for higher tiered devices. Since it is marketed as a mid-tier phone, Sony has to make some compromises. While the XZ has been praised for not having the cupping effect because of its front facing speakers, the Xperia XA1 Plus seems to backtrack on this with a little speaker on the bottom of the device, which is somewhat average since low tones are hardly audible as opposed to mids being relatively balance. Despite that Sony has installed ClearAudio+ for audio improvements. Lastly battery life should be mentioned. The Xperia XA1 Plus is equipped with a reasonably large battery at 3.430 mAh. Hence, users can be assured of a full dayâs worth and then some of usage. It seems when compared to its other sibling, the Xperia XA1 Sony might have designed an all rounded mid-tier device without cutting too much corners. The Xperia XA1 Plus is a solid device albeit one which is also well priced for what it is delivering.. This display is quite big for a smartphone but frequently used for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. From 2014, Sony has reduced the production of Vaio laptops and finally discontinued them. Sony is still present in the smartphone and tablet market, yet not among the Top 5 manufacturers.. Similar devices from a different Manufacturer. Samsung Galaxy On Max Mali-T880 MP2.

Sony released three new smartphones at the IFA event in Berlin, one of them being the Xperia XA1 Plus. The Xperia XA1 Plus fills in the gap between the 5-inch and 6-inch displays with its 5.5-inch full HD LCD screen.. Sony recently announced its latest mid-range smartphone offering, the Xperia XA1 Plus , at the IFA event in Berlin, Germany. It is also worth mentioning that it arrived alongside two Sony phones, namely the Xperia XZ1 and Xperia XZ1 Compact. The Sony Xperia XA1 Plus is the most fitting device for you if you think the Xperia XA1 with a 5-inch screen is too small and the Xperia XA1 Ultra with a 6-inch display is too big. It fills the gap between 5-inch and 6-inch displays by sporting a 5.5-inch LCD screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. Design-wise, the newly-launched handset packs a close resemblance to the others in the lineup. It features an edge-to-edge display panel, aluminum sides, plastic back, a noticeably large top and bottom bezels, and a matte finish. It measures 155 x 75 x 8.7 mm and has a body weight of 190 grams.. Introducing Xperia XA1 Plus – Epic entertainment. Even the internals of the Xperia XA1 Plus doesn't differ much from its siblings. For instance, it still comes with the same MediaTek MT6757 helio P20 octa-core processor coupled with Mali-T880 MP2 GPU. It ships with 4GB of RAM and 32GB internal flash storage which supports an expandable memory of up to 256GB via microSD card. Apparently, the South America and the US will only get the 3GB RAM variant. On the camera department, the phone features 23-megapixel Exmor RS rear snapper having a 24mm wide-angle lens, autofocus, and a f/2.0 aperture. Up front, there's an 8-megapixel selfie shooter with a 23mm f/2.0 aperture lens. It runs on a pre-installed Android Nougat operating system and packs a 3420mAh battery with support for Qnovo adaptive charging and Quick Charge 2.0+ technology.. The Sony Xperia XA1 Plus is expected to be available sometime around September or October. It will come in three color variants, namely Black, Blue, and Gold. There might be an additional Pink model of the handset, which is said to be market dependent. Reviews of Sony Xperia XA1 Plus. User Review : 2 Reviews.

Sony Xperia XA1 Plus Review: The perfect mid-range media device?. Sony Xperia XA1 Plus review: Design. Sony Xperia XA1 Plus review: Screen and media. Sony Xperia XA1 Plus review: Features and OS. Sony Xperia XA1 Plus review: Performance and battery life. Sony Xperia XA1 Plus review: Cameras. Sony Xperia XA1 Plus review: Verdict. Screen size 5.5-inches Screen resolution 1920x1080 Weight 190g OS Android Nougat Rear Camera 23MP Front camera 8MP Processor Mediatek P20 Memory 3GB Storage 32GB + microSD 4G LTE Yes Bonus features Fingerprint sensor. Sharp, spacious screen Premium design work Impressive battery tech. Sony’s Xperia XA1 Plus offers a big-screen media experience, coupled with long battery life to keep you streaming movies and shows all day long. Factor in the satisfying camera tech and £300 asking price and it’s a viable alternative to other well-specced mid-range mobiles.. Earlier in 2017, Sony released the rather excellent Xperia XA1 smartphone. This 5-inch handset costs just a shade over £200 and yet offers a similar sleek design to more premium Xperia handsets, plus some decent specs and features.. Now we’re nearing the end of the year and Sony has launched a bigger version of the XA1, known as the Xperia XA1 Plus. This Plus-sized model serves up a more spacious screen (this time a 5.5-incher with Full HD resolution), plus a bigger battery for extended life between charges. You also get the same 23-megapixel rear camera, which can capture some good-looking everyday images.. I’ve been using the Sony Xperia XA1 Plus as my full-time phone for a week now and here’s my full review. You can check out our favourite affordable phones of 2017 to see some of the best rivals right now.. When you first pick up the Xperia XA1 Plus, chances are you’ll be surprised that it’s not a more expensive device. Sony has crafted a premium-feeling phone that has a surprising heft, to more or less match the flagship Xperias.. Like the Xperia XZ1 and XZ Premium before it, the XA1 Plus sports Sony’s typical ‘stretched’ design work. Those bezels to the sides of the screen are pleasingly slender, although they also stretch out quite far above and below in the usual Xperia styling. Comfortably curved edges sit in stark contrast to the flat top and bottom, which helps these phones to stand out from the crowd.. Although the XA1 Plus fits nicely against the palm, there’s no denying it’s a struggle to use one-handed. Sony still refuses to offer up any kind of assistance in this area, such as the ability to pull down the notifications tab with a gesture or button tap. Likewise, you can’t shrink down the usable display in times of need. You’ll definitely need to use both hands to operate this phone when on the move.. There’s no kind of water resistance, which isn’t surprising at this price point. And while that matte surfacing is reasonably resistant to damage, scouring the phone’s rear with a pointed implement such as a key will leave a light yet lasting impression.. While we had the standard black model for review, you can also pick up the XA1 Plus in a jazzy gold or fetching blue finish.. The Xperia XA1 Plus sports that iconic Sony Mobile design work, with a premium feel despite its mid-range asking price.. No kind of one-handed mode means two handed use is obligatory, given the increase in dimensions over the original Xperia XA1.. While the standard Xperia XA1 offered up a 5-inch 720p screen for digesting your media and everything else, the Xperia XA1 Plus boosts this in terms of both size and resolution. So now you get a 5.5-inch IPS LCD panel with a Full HD 1920×1080 pixel resolution.. The Plus model’s panel is therefore better suited to consuming movies and shows on the go. Stream a lot of Netflix? This handset will handle it pleasingly well. Images are crisp, even though the screen is a good size, so you can enjoy strong detail levels. Likewise, the maximum brightness is strong enough to cut through glare and visuals don’t fade as you tilt the screen.. We’re pleased with the colour reproduction too. Dive into the Xperia XA1 Plus’ display settings and you can activate Super Vivid Mode, which boosts those hues and makes your photos really pop.. The only feature we miss is a night mode, to filter blue light and produce warmer visuals for more comfortable viewing in the dark.. Jump into the audio settings and you’ll find some bonus modes in there too. You have a manual equaliser to tweak your audio ranges, or you can simply allow the ClearAudio+ engine to handle things for you. There’s also a Dynamic Normaliser, so you aren’t caught unawares by sudden, glaring differences in volume levels between songs.. Of course, you’ll want to plug a pair of headphones into the Xperia for enjoying music. The single speaker, located on the bottom edge of the phone, pumps out quite tinny sound with rather pathetic levels of bass. You can carry around a pretty decent media collection on this Sony handset too, if you don’t like streaming. The 32GB of storage space fills quite quickly, so thankfully you can expand by up to a further 256GB using a microSD memory card. Sony’s Smart Cleaner feature can also help you to clear any rubbish from your Xperia XA1 Plus’ cache, when more internal storage is required.. The sharp and vibrant Full HD screen is a great way to indulge in a Netflix binge session on the move. You can also carry lots of music and movies around if you don’t have the data allowance to stream, thanks to the microSD card support.. At this price point, we’d be nit picking if we began to complain. Although the lack of a night mode is kind of annoying.. If you’ve used a Sony Xperia smartphone in recent times, you’ll know what to expect here. Android Nougat comes overlaid with Sony’s own UI, which changes the look and feel of Google’s mobile OS and layers a fair few bonus features on top.. Sony’s unified themes match the colour of your handset and look pretty sleek; these are some of the few smartphone themes that we happily leave on our handsets, rather than immediately changing out.. Jump into the settings and you’ll find a fair few options to play around with. Besides the themes and a/v stuff already mentioned, you’ll find resource management tools to keep your Xperia XA1 Plus operating smoothly. Your Sony mobile can also throw personalised tips on screen as it gets to know you, while the built-in tutorials and guides can help smartphone noobs to get to grips with the handset.. Sony has also added some apps of its own to the Xperia XA1 Plus. The likes of the Album and Music app are unnecessary in this day of Google’s Photos and Play apps, and we wonder about how many users actually ever open the Xperia Lounge or What’s New apps, to see Sony’s recommendations and news updates. Only some of these can be cleaned off the phone as well, to free up space.. Likewise, the Playstation app offers limited functionality on this device. More premium Sony phones can stream gaming sessions direct from your PS4, but the XA1 Plus can only be used as a second screen in compatible games; or to check on your mates’ recent achievements.. On the right edge of the XA1 Plus you’ll find a fingerprint sensor, built into the elongated power button. This scanner is as accurate as any other out there, responding instantly when you push on the button to unlock the handset. And while the unlocking action isn’t the quickest out there, you shouldn’t be disappointed by the brief delay. Responsiveness only takes a hit when your digits are wet or dirty, a common complaint of these sensors.. Sony’s UI may not be the most exciting out there, although the themes are great and you get some decent resource management.. Many of the best Sony smartphone features, such as PS4 game streaming, aren’t available on the Xperia XA1 Plus. Many of the apps that come stacked onto the phone can’t be deleted if desired, either.. Don’t fret that the Xperia XA1 Plus packs in a Mediatek chipset, often the bane of our lives when using more affordable phones. The Mediatek P20 platform, backed here by 3GB of RAM, actually does a reasonable job of running things.. Sure, you’ll see the odd pause as you skip between apps, yet these stumbles are rarely irritating. The XA1 Plus can also play fast-paced games such as Asphalt 8 with a smooth-enough frame rate, so you can waste time on your commute.. The fact that this is a more powerful handset than previous Sony mid-rangers is proven by the presence of living wallpapers, which morph as you scroll around your desktops. These are fluid at all times and make a nice change from the static efforts of yesteryear.. While performance is perfectly fine, we’re certainly impressed by the Xperia XA1 Plus’ battery life.. That 3430mAh battery offers close to two full days of battery life per charge, even with plenty of camera use, online browsing and media streaming. For those rare moments where you find yourself actually running low on juice, Sony has even included a Stamina Mode and Ultra Stamina Mode (depending on how desperate you are). These cull non-essential features, to limit drain while keeping you connected.. Qnovo Adaptive Charging is also on board, to keep your battery from wearing out over time through overcharging. On previous Sony phones this certainly seems to do the job; we’ve seen little reduction in battery life even after months or years of use, which is certainly impressive.. Great battery life, with the Qnovo charging tech to help prevent long term damage, means you should rarely – if ever – be desperate to plug the Xperia XA1 Plus into the mains.. Although you’ll see the occasional stutter and pause, that’s pretty much to be expected at this price point anyway.. Mounted on the rear of the Xperia XA1 Plus, you’ll find a 23-megapixel Sony snapper that can capture impressively good-looking and detailed images in decent light. Tricky conditions are generally well handled, with the Superior Auto mode doing all of the grunt work on your behalf.. We’re certainly impressed given the asking price of this phone, although some rivals such as the Moto G5 Plus offer better results at night. Video recording is also limited to Full HD at 30 frames-per-second, while the Moto serves up full 4K Ultra HD recording.. Check out our in-depth Xperia XA1 Plus camera review for photo and video samples and our full analysis.. You can expect good-looking results as long as the lighting conditions aren’t too challenging, with full manual controls also on offer for experts.. Video recording tops out at Full HD 30fps, while night shots suffer from grain and other issues.. The Xperia XA1 Plus certainly isn’t a perfect mid-range mobile and it’s up against strong competition from the likes of the Moto G5s Plus and Samsung’s Galaxy A and J Series handsets.. Still, the crisp and colourful 5.5-inch screen, combined with the long battery life and expandable storage, means this is a solid way to take in shows and flicks on your commute. Likewise, that 23-megapixel camera will capture good looking memories, as long as lighting conditions aren’t too tricky.. You can pick up the Xperia XA1 Plus for £329 SIM-free here in the UK, from Carphone Warehouse.. What are the best Sony Xperia mobiles right now?. Sony Xperia XA1 Review: In Depth.
