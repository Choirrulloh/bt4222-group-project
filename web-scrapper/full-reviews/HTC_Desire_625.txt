Average rating: 5 out of 5 stars, based on reviews. I have had a couple of other phones from Wal-Mart, like Windows 620, And a cheaper phone a few years, and (I even had an iphone 5), and by far, this phone beats them all!!! I really don't know why people are complaining...It delivers EVERYTHING A Phone should, and more!! It NEVER lags, it takes beautiful pictures. Its very easy to set up, it has built-in apps for helping you with anything you may need them for, like setting it up, and learning about your phone...Like, I love that I was able to get such a great phone for $100!!!!! And, I usually use a different service plan, And honestly I'm glad I tried Criket! It has WONDERFUL coverage, and it's hard to get that here, due to all the hills. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE, AND THE SERVICE!!!. Yes (46) No (11) Report. Average rating: 5 out of 5 stars, based on reviews. I've been using a Galaxy S4 for quite awhile. My 625 is performing great for my needs - I don't play games. Quite a bit of the memory is used for the operating system but I put a 32 GB micro SD card in the phone and moved everything I could to the card. The only thing I would change, so far, is have the screens continuously scroll around and not have to stop at the last screen and reverse the the scroll direction. The battery life has been good for me so far.. Yes (23) No (2) Report. 1-5 of 18 reviews. See any care plans, options and policies that may be associated with this product..

It has its bell and whistles for a user working a full time job with no time to sit down and mess with the phone much. It has 43 apps to update from first boot with 2.4GB storage available down to 700MB left remaining after updating all stock apps. Does tend to get a little warm playing light games like Gordon Ramsay Dash or watching movies in 720P. 240p or below doesn't get warm so keep that in mind. And if i have to compare this phone to my Moto E 2nd Gen i can say the HTC 625 is Lag free and responsive. Moto E 2nd Gen Go Phone does lag a lot since its running on stock android but 8% better in performance and impossible to unlock bootloader but you can unlock the phone to use any carrier.. So based on usage and testing it feels like its perfect for only making calls checking GPS maps and texting any other heavy usage expect the phone to get warm quick and drain fast with the small battery it has.. Rooting is available at HTC Dev but have not attempted yet with my busy schedule since i plan on removing the stock apps to make room. And no roms are out there for this phone it keeps getting mistaken for a HTC 626 or Lumia 626.. Buying price as of July 24 2016 50$ Cricket Wireless prepaid section at your local super market..

I have a Desire 625 (from cricket in case any others exist, it probably wouldnt make a difference) and it is almost exactly the same as a 626s. For some reason though, the camera which is supposed to be only 5 MP instead of 8 which implies it is a different cam... That said mine had an unlocked sim for Iwireless/tmobile. I unlocked the bootloader and used the version of TWRP written for it and it worked flawlessly (I did have issues with SDcard support, I ended up having to use ADB to push my rom to the sdcard). I installed the debloated boost\sprint marshmallow rom and it did have issues activating of course but beyond that the phone itself is now working and I am on wifi and have data and no problems except I cant figure out how to get LTE to work thus far. My "4G" HSDPA+ connection is working at least as I did pull 5 mb/s down and 2.5 up during a test albeit with full signal and it does say "G" like it's pulling GPRS when it isnt. (EDIT: After i posted that eventually it vibrated and started pulling LTE signal). That said welcome to having another dev in this community and I look forward to making this phone not suck (coming from an S5 that ran nearly as fast as an S6 after my S5 fell in water and died).

I have the HTC Desire 625 as well, it's a great phone for the price. At this point, mine is just rooted and sim unlocked for AT&T. I'm planning on trying to flash the T-Mobile or MetroPCS HTC Desire 626s Marshmallow RUU when it is released.. Join Date: Joined: Dec 2014. The boost one will work great on the phone. The only problem I see is that it takes awhile (around 5-10 mins) to get an LTE lock after boot but after it gets it it works fine (GSM and HSDPA are immediate). It may be a bit of a wait for the others with minimal gains/differences between the two. I'm thinking it's just some .prop settings that need changed.. Join Date: Joined: Jul 2010. My Devices: T-Mobile LG G3 , T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Has anyone flashed the Sprint/Boost rom on the 626 from Metro PCS?. Join Date: Joined: Feb 2013. amazing! I'm using the Cricket 625 as well, had TWRP installed, rooted, customized, etc.....and the thing just died after a simple restart one day. It was stuck on the HTC logo screen after the Cricket Wireless boot animation. I flashed the Sprint Debloated MM Rom and I'm back up and running. Has anyone been able to activate the handset yet? I receive texts/have data, etc, but when it comes to making phone calls, I cannot. Of course this is a designated Sprint ROM, but anyone have any idea how to get the actual phone connection activated? Advice is much appreciated. ---------- Post added at 12:53 PM ---------- Previous post was at 12:37 PM ----------. Join Date: Joined: Aug 2013. Ok how did you guys do it?.

Download our Official Android App: Forums for Android!. Discussion in ' Android Help ' started by jessemarks351 , Aug 28, 2017 .. I am trying to root my phone so that I can use link2sd and make more room on my phone by making a second partition on my SD card to do this I have to unlock or atleast S-Off. I have to make it permanently rooted.&nbsp; There is no information&nbsp; about the HTC Desire 625 (android 5.1). Please contact me a.s.a.p (910)590-6925 or jessemarks351@gmail.com. If there is a custom recovery for this phone (don't use one built for a different model!) then you can unlock the bootloader, flash the recovery, then use that to flash a superuser package. HTC provide a bootloader unlocking tool at HTCdev.com (of course some US carriers exclude their phones from it). S-Off is not needed for what you want to do.. so what do I need to look up then I just tried to use kingoroot 5 times with the PC and without the PC and it did not work. It seems that every website I look on they have all different kinds of HTC Desire phones but not the 625 what's up with the 625 why is it on nobody list. When I go to HTC dtv.com to unlock the bootloader&nbsp; it does not have the option for the&nbsp; 625 but I has a 'HTC Desire' option witn no numbers after it.&nbsp;. If there is a custom recovery for this phone (don't use one built for a different model!) then you can unlock the bootloader, flash the recovery, then use that to flash a superuser package. HTC provide a bootloader unlocking tool at HTCdev.com (of course some US carriers exclude their phones from it). &lt;br&gt; S-Off is not needed for what you want to do.. HTC Desire with no numbers will be the A8181, codename Bravo, i.e. the first "Desire" HTC released (back when Desire was the flagship range rather than midrange/budget). That definitely isn't what you want: with that device you had to flash a particular software version for the bootloader unlock to work (the phone is older than the bootloader unlocking tool), and that's what you'll get if you choose that one. If you want to unlock the bootloader (be warned: this will wipe the device, so back up first) then choose "All Other Supported Models" from the list of options would be my guess. There is an XDA thread here where people seem to be saying that they were able to use a TWRP built for the Desire 626s. At your own risk if you try that though, since in general it is not safe to use a recovery built for a different device - if these people have succeeded it implies that the two models are identical in the way they organise their storage. I'm slightly surprised none of those rooting apps work on an Android 5.1 device (though I'm not a huge fan of them personally).. It gives me some instructions that I don't understand on how to do an upload.&nbsp; It says to find the ROM version in the table below and click on the RUU to download it I don't know where to find them. File size: 230.7 KB. File size: 187.8 KB. File size: 169.4 KB. File size: 143.9 KB. Did you click on the "HTC Desire" link? That's where I'd expect it to tell you to choose an RUU, and isn't what you want. Sorry, going offline now because I'm European and it's midnight.. Do you already have an account?.

I think you meant the TWRP, not CDMA. & it be best to double check before trying just internet serch. ---------- Post added at 02:33 PM ---------- Previous post was at 02:19 PM ----------. You're in the wrong area to use TWRP, or {Install a new Oden (Kerrnal) [Download Mode]}. Bootloader isn't for anything useful to lame brains like me, besides unlocking the bootloader, rooting it, and fixing the SD write issue, then relocking the bootloader. What we did wrong is this! we didn't have all the correct programs running when we unlocked the bootloader, after that we rooted our phones. Gotten the root is correctly installed from a root apk/exe {programs} once we reset our phones, we get stuck at the service provider screen. the only way off this screen is to press the both volume. buttons + power until it resets. if we don't press the volume down + power buttons it reboots & locks up again at the service provider screen..

HTC phones can flash stock ROMs, known as RUUs, right from the phone's bootloader. You'll need to Google around for your device's specific RUU file, but once you download it, save the ZIP file to your SD card, and rename it (to something like PG05IMG.zip—the download page for the RUU file should specify which filename is required), booting up your phone should automatically flash the stock ROM from HBOOT, HTC's bootloader. Join Date: Joined: Aug 2016. My Devices: Motorola Droid RAZR HD , LG G Pro 2 , HTC Desire 626. I have the exact same issue of this thread and I've been looking all over google for at least one stock ROM for the desire for like 3 weeks now and I did read some of the thread you quote before and was really usefull for my Moto Droid Razr HD but It would be AWESOME if you have an idea of where to find a ROM for this phone specific.

I just bought one of these (Cricket HTC 625) to use as a temporary phone after my Sony Z2 Failed (Touch screen spazzing out/left, 1/4 non-responsive). I am going to (carrier) unlock it, but obviously a more generic ROM would be nice, too. I'm experienced at installing ROMs via various way, installing recoveries, using ADB, etc., but I know nothing about this phone (I've never had an HTC phone). Is this phone essentially a branded 626?. Can I re/un brand it with any 626 rom?. A quick intro to this phone would be appreciated.. Join Date: Joined: Jul 2013. I also bought a 625 from cricket recently. Someone told me via pm here at the forum that it could be rooted using the same method as the 626s, but the person has not (yet) pointed me to the guide he used. I'd like to learn more also. Join Date: Joined: Apr 2012. I bought a couple of these as "Refurbished HTC 625" from Cricket for $0.99. The phone I received is an HTC Desire 626s. In fact if you look at the "settings->about->phone" it says "HTC Desire 626s". I was able to unlock the bootloader / install a custom recovery / root, but there does not appear to be any ROMs available. My previous experience was with Kindle Fires and Nexus 5s, so I was a bit surprised with the dev threads for this phone..
