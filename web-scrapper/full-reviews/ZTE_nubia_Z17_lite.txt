The Nubia Z17 Lite is a genuine bezel-less Smartphone, the same Appearance as the Nubia Z17. The device packs a 5.5-inch full HD display with Corning Gorilla Glass screen. The Z17 Lite employs a distinct visual style and upholds the signature Nubia look. It is sturdy and well-built, but quite slippery to hold. In addition to, Nubia Z17 Lite is a potential flagship offer and a beastly one at that.. The Nubia Z17 Lite features a 5.5-inch TFT screen display with a resolution of 1080 pixels by 1920 pixels, and with a pixel density of 403ppi.. On the front, the full screen of Nubia Z17 Lite used Corning Gorilla Glass to prevent accidental scratches. There are a receiver and front camera on the top. The bottom has a standard USB Type-C port, a microphone, a speaker. The USB Type-C port means Z17 Lite with fewer ports, more flexibility, better data transfer speeds, and even better sound.. That's right, Nubia Z17 Lite made the switch to a single Type-C port, getting rid of the 3.5mm audio jack. Don’t worry, because this device comes with the earphone adapter line. On the back, the Nubia Z17 Lite’s unibody design means the battery is not removable the same as Nubia Z17 with a sleek metal back. Nubia Z17 Lite retains the premium full metal unibody construction that was introduced with its predecessor but comes with a frosted surface that looks and feels even better. Nubia Z17 Lite also comes with a fingerprint sensor on the back.. The Nubia Z17 Lite packs a powerful octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 653 processor. The handset includes 6GB of LPDDR3 RAM, Adreno 510 GPU, as well as 64GB of inbuilt storage.. Much like the Nubia Z17, the Nubia Z17 Lite also adopts the NeoPower 3.0 technology, packs a 3200mAh non-removable battery, and supports QC3.0 charging, the one brilliant highlight of the device.. On the camera, the Nubia Z17 Lite equips a 16.0MP front camera (SAMSUNG sensor) and dual 13.0MP dual rear camera (SONY IMX258 Color + B/W sensor) with NeoVision 7.0, f/ 2.2 aperture, PDAF phase focus, and also supports 1080p, even 4K video recording. There is a 16.0MP front-facing camera which supports multi-filters & 10-level beautify, f2.0 aperture and fill light technology. Still images from the primary camera are very detailed with more laid-back processing and noise reduction yet virtually noise-free. The Z17 Lite performs well in low-light conditions as well. The front camera captures pretty nice photos as well, with plenty of detail and little noise. Portrait mode on the main camera works surprisingly well.. The dual-SIM Nubia Z17 Lite supports two Nano-SIM cards. Both SIM slots are compatible with 4G respectively. When they work at the same time, only one of them can receive LTE service and the other 3G network.. The Nubia Z17 Lite runs on Nubia UI 5.0, which utilizes an Android 7.1 core. Nubia UI 5.0 brings its take at the interface and improves on its performance. The icons vividly represent elements of real life, the acclaimed Nubia Transfer and split screen functions are still present, the application-cloning function also supports more apps, the off-edge gestures are still one of Nubia's calling cards, and the super screenshot has even more functions. The Nubia UI 5.0 manages background tasks really aggressively. The default browser might be dodgy, but appears to be well optimized for power efficiency.. Now we have the Nubia Z17 Lite for sale, it is the official version with pre-installed multi-language and Google play store, Google service, and Google Assistant by Nubia Company.

You can see the list of all ZTE devices here .. Joining the list of ZTE is the new ZTE Nubia Z17 Lite. Though there have been two variants of the Nubia Z17 in the past, this is the latest. The device basically stands in between the main ZTE Nubia Z17 and the ZTE Nubia Z17 Mini. Let’s have a look at the specifications.. Regarding design and body build, the ZTE Nubia Z17 Lite is the exact replica of the ZTE Nubia Z17. They have the same dimensions (153 x 72.6 x 7.6 mm), same screen size and type (5.5 inches IPS capacitive touchscreen), same display resolution (1080 x 1920 pixels ) and the positions of the cameras, fingerprint scanner, and volume adjusters are the same on both devices..

A Qualcomm Adreno 510 GPU handles all graphical aspect of the device.. The processing unit of the ZTE Nubia Z17 Lite is lower than that of the Nubia 17. Being a Lite (toned down) version, it is quite expected. However, the device still performs well enough. As a matter of fact, it sports a massive 6 GB of RAM and 64GB of built-in storage. The huge RAM give rooms for fluid multitasking.. Just in case the inherent 64GB ROM isn’t enough to handle your storage needs, you can expand to up to 256 GB using an external micro SD card in the SIM 2 port..
