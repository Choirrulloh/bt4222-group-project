more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 8 GB + MicroSD. Release date: Jul 1, 2016. View all photos (6). Too little RAM memory (1.5 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (294 ppi). The Samsung Galaxy J2 (2016) sports a 5-inch 720p display, 1.5 GHz quad-core processor, 1.5 GB of RAM, 8-megapixel autofocus camera and an additional 5-megapixel selfie unit on the front.. Dimensions: 5.61 x 2.80 x 0.31 inches (142.4 x 71.1 x 8 mm). Weight: 4.87 oz (138 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus, CMOS image sensor. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 14.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 5, 8, 20. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

While it does have a few positives with a good display, front camera and battery life, the Galaxy J2 2016 compromises on too many essentials. The extremely dated internals, 8GB of internal storage, the all plastic build and the lack of an ambient light sensor make it a very sub-par offering from Samsung.. Smart Glow is a nice idea. Lack of basics like the ambient light sensor. No Gorilla Glass and only 8GB of internal storage. Specifications: Design Build Quality Connectivity/Sensors Display Hardware Performance Turbo Speed Technology Smart Glow Software Ultra Data Savings Mode S Bike mode Camera Battery Life Likes Dislikes Verdict. The Samsung Galaxy J2 2016 is a follow up version of the Galaxy J2 launched in 2015.. Galaxy J2 2016 has been re-engineered and re-designed with new 'Make for India' features such as Turbo Speed Technology (TST), which Samsung claims results in superior device performance, and Smart Glow, a colour LED notification system.. According to Samsung, the Galaxy J2 is India's largest selling smartphone and the J2 2016 aims to build up on the success of its predecessor.. The smartphone, priced at Rs 9,750, finds itself in a heavily saturated and competitive marketplace, populated by the likes of the recently launched Moto G4 Play, the LeEco Le 1s Eco, the slightly more expensive Redmi Note 3 and the Asus Zenfone 2.. Does Samsung's new budget competitor have what it takes to battle it out with these segment heavyweights? Let's find out. : 5-inch 720p HD Super AMOLED display. : Samsung's TouchWiz UI running atop Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. : 8GB internal storage, microSD support. : 8MP f/2.2 rear camera (LED flash), 5MP f/2.2 front camera. : Wi-Fi, 3G/4G/2G, GPS, Bluetooth, microUSB 2.0. : 142.4 X 71.1 X 8.0 mm. For many years, Samsung was known for making plasticky handsets with mediocre build quality and uninspired designs. and the S6 Edge which ushered in a svelte metal and glass design that. From the days of the ungainly and bulky Galaxy S5, Samsung transformed. it's ugly duckling into a beautiful swan with the Galaxy S6.. Now you will be asking why I am talking about the flagship Galaxy in an article reviewing the J2.. That's because even though Samsung has made serious headways when it. comes to design in its flagships, the same cannot be said for its low. Some attempts have been made by Samsung in the form of the metal infused. A series and the inclusion of textured lines along the sides and. underneath the Samsung logo on the back in the J2.. However, with the competition seriously stepping up its game when it comes to build quality and design, the Samsung Galaxy J2 looks uninspired and boring.. The build quality of the device is also nothing to write home about. The all plastic construction doesn't inspire much confidence and feels. The back is removable and is very smooth and slippery. smartphone, the quality of the removable back panel is rather poor. However, it must be noted that the back panel is of a better quality. than the one found on the Samsung Galaxy J5 and J7, which feels like it. will break with just a modicum of force.. The removable back comes with the usual advantages of having a. removable battery and easy access to the two SIM card slots and the. The volume and power keys are a bit on the small side and are very hard. The single external speaker unit is loud enough, but sounds. muddled and tinny at full volume. The earpiece is great though and calls. made through the phone could be heard loud and clear.. Samsung needs to realise that the market landscape has changed. drastically, with the introduction of Chinese brands who have helped. push the envelope forward when it comes to design and build quality.. It's high time Samsung stops riding on the wave of its brand name and. starts taking the design and build of its lower end devices seriously.. On the connectivity front, the Samsung Galaxy J2 2016 is a dualSIM. device that supports 4G LTE, 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth V4.1 and. It comes with a proximity sensor and an accelerometer.. Auto brightness sensor? Doesn't exist Haptic Feedback? No. The Samsung Galaxy J2 lacks basic sensors which became commonplace on. I fail to understand why Samsung refuses to equip. their low end smartphones with these, as they would cost the company. Not having an auto brightness sensor, noise cancelling microphone and haptic feedback is just inexcusable in 2016.. One can make a case that the Notification LED is not needed because of Smart Glow, but we will come to it later as to why Smart Glow is not as 'revolutionary' as Samsung claims.. At the price, the lack of a fingerprint sensor is not that much of a deal breaker, but shouldn't we expect the best from the leading smartphone manufacturer? Smartphones such as the Coolpad Note 3 and LeEco Le 1s come with a fingerprint sensor in the same price range.. Now, the J2 doesn't support NFC. But, the J3 at Rs 8,499 does. This is another example of Samsung's penchant of making too many smartphones and deliberately leaving out one or the other feature from a device just to differentiate it from its other similarly priced devices.. The display, in trademark Samsung fashion, is a sAMOLED panel and thus has ultra-vivid colors, which border on looking a tad unrealistic.. The blacks are deep and inky and images and video 'pop' on the screen. The viewing angles are also great and so is sunlight legibility.. Of course due to the lack of an auto brightness sensor, you would have to manually increase the brightness every single time you go outside. Samsung has included something called an outdoor mode, which can be activated by a toggle that sits right next to the brightness bar in the quick setting toggle.. This outdoor mode maximises the display's brightness for a period of 15. mins, after which the brightness reverts back to the previous setting.. This outdoor mode is well and good, but it's need is necessitated only. because of Samsung's reluctance to include a basic sensor.. Overall, the display is actually the redeeming factor of the Galaxy J2 2016, which underperforms in almost every other aspect.. The Samsung Galaxy J2 is powered by the 32-bit Spreadtrum SC9830. processor clocked at 1.5GHz coupled with a Mali-400MP2 GPU, 1.5GB of. RAM, 8GB internal storage (expandable via a microSD card slot) and a. The Galaxy J2 also comes with 2 unique features, Smart Glow, a color. notification LED system and Turbo Speed Technology (TST), which. according to Samsung helps improve the device's speed and performance. We will talk about these features in detail further on.. 8GB of internal storage is a big disappointment, and the phone comes. with only 3.6GB of usable storage out of the box. benchmarking applications, Facebook, WhatsApp and 3 games, the phone was. just left with 1.4GB of internal storage.. Before we talk about the Samsung Galaxy J2 2016's performance, or lack. of it actually, we need to talk about the CPU and GPU that Samsung has. Samsung is marketing the device as having a 1.5 GHz quad-core. To the layman, this sounds great, quad-core means good. The 32-bit Spreadtrum SC9830 processor runs four Cortex A7 cores. smartphone world stopped using Cortex A7 over two years ago. announced the Cortex A7 back in 2012, and was seen in the first. generation Snapdragon 200 and 400 processors.. In fact, all low end devices these days use the 64-Bit Cortex A53,. which is much more modern and efficient than the obsolete A7.. Now let's talk about the GPU.. The Galaxy J2 2016 comes with the Mali-400 MP2 GPU, a dinosaur in today's day and age. As pointed out by C4E Tech on Youtube, Samsung used the same GPU in its Galaxy S2 smartphone in 2011.. The version of the Mali 400MP2 on the S2 had a higher clock speed and 2 more cores and was used to power a 480p display. Now Samsung has included a less powerful version of the MP2 to power a 720p HD display.. Thus, the performance on the Galaxy J2 2016 is sub-par to say the least. The UI feels laggy, apps take a second or two extra to load, web browsing is frustrating and the camera itself is slow to focus and take pictures.. Gaming performance is average at best. Simple games like Subway surfers and Candy Crush Saga play reasonably well, but heavier games are best avoided.. Samsung claims that Turbo Speed Technology (TST) is a revolutionary innovation which results in superior device performance. Samsung has rewritten native apps such as camera, gallery, and contacts, etc. that are most frequently used by consumers in order to make them as light as possible.. It also proactively shuts down idle processes running in the background and declutters RAM using its intelligent memory system to ensure resources like RAM and processor are free and ready to take on new tasks.. In real use, TST is a mixed bag.. TST does make a contribution to Samsung's built in applications, with apps such as the Gallery, Music app and E-mail loading very swiftly, but it does not make any contribution to third party applications and the general UI itself is also very laggy.. TST is a nice concept and does help speed up some parts of the OS, but it is not a substitute for proper hardware. TST needs to be paired with a decent CPU and GPU in order to be genuinely useful.. No amount of software optimization can compensate for excruciatingly slow and dated internals. Smart Glow consists of an LED ring around the rear camera which can be customized for priority notifications of any app or contact. It also alerts a user if they are running low on battery, internal memory, or mobile data.. You can choose any color you want, and there is a full RGB color picker. While does this offer infinite combinations, it is a bit difficult to use as there is no preview of the color on offer in the interface.. There is also a selfie assist feature which uses Smart Glow to help take a selfie with the rear camera.. Smart Glow is a nice addition, and is genuinely useful in certain scenarios but is not implemented practically.. Getting notified when your battery is about to die or your storage is about to get full and knowing who is calling simply by seeing the color of the ring is really convenient and is a nice feature to have.. However, the fact that in order to use Smart Glow, you have to place your phone with the screen facing down limits the practical use of this feature considerably.. What compounds this problem further is that the display is not protected by Gorilla Glass. As the normal use case of Smart Glow would involve the screen being exposed to a table or other hard surfaces, the lack of Gorilla Glass can lead to scratches.. The Samsung Galaxy J2 2016 runs on Samsung's own TouchWiz UI running atop Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Doze mode, application permission control and all other Marshmallow goodness is on offer here, just with a dash of Samsung's customisation.. Out of the box, the quick notifications tray has 18 icons, which thankfully are user customisable and can be whittled down to a more reasonable size.. Long pressing the home button opens up Google Now on Tap and a double press leads to the camera app instead of Samsung's rarely used S Voice. It's good to see Samsung finally ditching S Voice for the much more popular and powerful Google Now.. Out of the box, the device comes with tons of pre-loaded applications, including a whole suite of Microsoft Applications, namely Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneDrive , OneNote and Skype. Samsung has gone the extra mile in the Galaxy J2 in simplifying TouchWIz. As a part of the Turbo Speed Technology, Samsung has decluttered the OS and made certain changes aimed at simplifying the user experience.. For example, the application list in now vertical scrolling instead of horizontal, which makes it much easier to navigate to whichever application you want to open, especially if you have a lot of apps installed.. Samsung has also included shortcuts for the Calculator, FM Radio, Flashlight as well as a mirror application right on the lock screen. As these are not content sensitive, these can be accessed without entering the device's password.. Additionally, the OS doesn't automatically place shortcuts for newly installed applications on the home screen in a bid to avoid clutter.. All these modifications are great, and do help make this iteration of TouchWiz the best I have used to date in terms of user friendliness. However, compared to stock Android, TouchWiz still seems a bit incoherent and messy.. The J2 2016 also comes with Samsung's much touted Ultra Data Savings mode, which Samsung claims provides up to 50% mobile data savings by blocking unnecessary background applications from consuming data.. While the Ultra Data Savings Mode is a genuinely useful application, it is nothing but a repackaged Opera Max, which can be downloaded on any phone and will prove the same functionality.. It is great that Samsung integrates it directly into the OS, as not many people are aware of Opera Max, but what irks me is how Samsung claims it is something extremely innovative and unique.. The Samsung Galaxy J2 2016 also comes with Samsung's much hyped S bike mode. The smartphone comes with a specialised NFC sticker/tag that sticks to the bike fuel tank. ​The rider needs to switch on the S bike mode on the smartphone before setting off on the ride, and then tap the sticker with the handset.. Upon activation, the S bike mode mutes incoming calls and notifies the caller with an automated message that the user is riding a two-wheeler and cannot take calls at the moment. If however, the caller wants to convey a message urgently and cannot wait for the rider to call back, then he/ she has the option of redirecting the call by pressing 1 on their smartphone.. When the caller does this, the Samsung Galaxy J2 2016 notifies the rider that the call is urgent by playing a different ring tone. Now comes the best part, to prevent any accidents, S Bike mode will not let the rider attend the call until he halts the two-wheeler.. The implementation is good however we think that the idea of notifying the rider by just playing a distinct ring tone can be easily missed on noisy Indian roads. To make it more intuitive, Samsung could have added a LED light bulb on the NFC sticker/tag.. S Bike mode, while an interesting and unique initiative, seems to be just a gimmick, and not really an essential feature.. You can read more about the S Bike mode in our dedicated review here .. The Samsung Galaxy J2 comes with an 8MP rear camera with autofocus and LED flash and a 5MP front camera. Both the cameras have an aperture of f/2.2.. The rear camera is above average and in well-lit situations, it produces sharp and vibrant images with vivid colors. In outdoor low light situations however, images lack detailing and have a noticeable amount of noise.. The camera is quite poor when it comes to shooting pictures indoor, as it really struggles with artificial light. In indoor low light scenarios, the situation is even worse as camera produces really muddy and dark images with a lot of noise.. The camera is also quite slow to focus and process images.. A big disappointment is the fact that the rear camera cannot shoot 1080 p HD videos, which is quite astonishing in this day and age in a 10,000-rupee smartphone. 720 p video shot by the camera is just about okay, usable only for Facebook or WhatsApp.. The front shooter is a big improvement from the previous J2, and is more than capable of handling your social media selfies.. The Samsung Galaxy J2 is powered by a 2,600mAh battery unit which is average at best. The device can make it through one day of light to moderate use. However, intensive use kills the battery before the sun sets.. Samsung's also has a rather nifty ultra-power saving mode, which applies a greyscale theme to your device.. What is really disappointing is how long the device takes to charge. It takes 3 hours to charge the device fully and using it with a fast charger yields no noticeable improvement.. The Samsung Galaxy J2 2016 has a decent screen and battery life and the device is quite compact and easy to use in one hand. The front camera is above average and S bike mode can be useful for some.. Smart Glow is a nice addition, and is genuinely useful in certain scenarios but is not implemented practically.. The Samsung Galaxy J2 2016 has a mediocre and uninspired design, questionable build quality, excruciatingly dated and slow internals and lacks basics such as an ambient light sensor, haptic feedback and a secondary noise cancelling microphone.. TST fails to deliver and the device is slow and laggy, and performs rather poorly. Smart Glow is a nice feature, but is not practical.. The display lacks Gorilla Glass protection, the rear camera produces very grainy and noisy pictures in low light and the camera app is slow to focus and process images.. It doesn't come with a fingerprint sensor, which is present is many of its competitors and the internal storage is a paltry 8GB, which yields only 3.6GB usable space for applications.. The Samsung Galaxy J2 is not worth Rs 9,750 in any way.. While it does have a few positives with a good display, compact dimensions, above average front camera and decent battery life, it compromises on too many essentials to be a good buy.. TST is nice, but no amount of software optimization can compensate for the extremely slow and dated CPU and GPU. In addition, the woeful 8GB of internal storage, lack of basics such as the ambient light sensor, the lack of Gorilla Glass and the all plastic build contribute to making the Galaxy J2 2016 an extremely mediocre offering.. Smartphones such as the LeEco Le 1S Eco, the upcoming Moto G4 Play and the slightly more expensive Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 are much bettery buys..

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone..

System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running..

FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Please ask the question in above box. Does it have any hanging problems?. Yes, and I was able to use only for 2 days and now I have thrown it inside my storeroom. So, I advise you not to buy Samsung Galaxy J2 and even if they give you for free, then also don't accept it.. But yeah you may have the problem of lagging when playing high-end games. But for normal use, it's a good multi-tasker, and sometimes the camera hangs, whenever you reopen the app.. No, simply use apps, it has no hanging problem. But if you play heavy games like Asphalt 8 and Nova, the high graphics games then there may be some hanging problems.. Not really, because it has Exynos processor that is a great management of memory and task. But only one thing is that it takes some time to run a heavy application.. No, it doesn't have the hanging problem. No hanging unless you fill the storage up to 99%.. Does it have any storage problems?. Only 8GB ROM is available in J2 2016. It is not sufficient for your mobile software update and to install applications.. It has only 8GB user memory, so it gives storage problem after installation of some applications..

It's battery life is good, both SIM slots can be used as 4G LTE, it has super AMOLED display, smart glow notification and faster internet.. samsung is widely used and easy to use. Moto G is something a little hard to operate, only qualified can operate this Moto G. i advice to go with Sansung J2 2016.

Samsung Galaxy J2 (2016) and Galaxy J Max announced in India. by Kris Carlon July 8, 2016. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Remember that interesting looking Samsung phone we shared last week with the ring flash-looking thing around the camera called Smart Glow? Well, that phone â the Galaxy J2 (2016) â and a massive, 7-inch monster called the Galaxy J Max have just been announced at a Samsung event in Delhi.. First, the Galaxy J2 (2016) price and release date: Rs. The Galaxy J2 (2016) specs feature a 5-inch HD Super AMOLED display, a Spreadtrum SC8830 quad-core 1.5 GHz processor, 1.5 GB of RAM, 8 GB of internal storage with microSD expansion, 8 MP/5 MP camera combo, LTE, 2,600 mAh battery and Android Marshmallow out of the box. It’s available in black, silver or gold colors.. The Galaxy J2 (2016) has been built with âMake for Indiaâ considerations like S Bike mode, Ultra Data Saving mode and Turbo Speed Technology. TST is reportedly able to launch native apps 40% faster than devices with double the RAM. You’ll also get that funky customizable LED notification ring called Smart Glow.. Smart Glow is a fully customizable LED notification light that works for âpriority notifications from any app or contactâ according to Samsung. While up to four alerts can be set, consumers can create and choose their own color for the Smart Glow. It also alerts a user if they are running low on battery, internal memory, or mobile data. Users can also use the Smart Glow LED ring to position the rear camera for higher mega-pixel selfies with the Selfie Assist feature.. Now, onto the Galaxy J Max. The Galaxy J Max has an insanely-large-for-a-phone 7-inch WXGA display, a Spreadtrum SC8830 quad-core SoC clocked at 1.5 GHz, 1.5 GB of RAM, 16 GB storage with microSD, 8 MP/2 MP camera combo, LTE, 4,000 mAh battery and â oddly â runs Android 5.1 Lollipop.

The Samsung Galaxy J2 2016 is a sad, modern disappointment. Samsung should feel bad for launching the Galaxy J2 2016.. Samsung is aggressively promoting its latest budget phone in India, the Galaxy J2 2016. Launched in July for ₹9,750 (~$150), the phone sports an outdated design and internal hardware no vendor would consider acceptable in mid-2016. The highlights include a 5-inch 720p AMOLED display, a Spreadtrum SC8830 SoC with four Cortex A7 cores, 1.5GB RAM, 8GB internal storage, microSD slot, and a 2600mAh battery.. India's largest handset maker — by a considerable margin — has deemed it reasonable to launch a phone powered by CPU cores that debuted in the first-gen Snapdragon 200 and 400 SoCs in 2013. On the GPU front, you get the Mali-400 MP2, another relic from a bygone era. Barring a few lackluster phones like the Galaxy Grand Neo Plus (which debuted in May 2015), the Spreadtrum SC8830 has been shunned by major vendors, and for good reason.. The J2 2016 fails to handle any processor-intensive tasks, and that's if you're able to install anything. It isn't powerful enough to run Snapchat (which says a lot about the phone), and while Instagram works, the 8MP camera at the back isn't great at taking detailed shots.. You get a measly 8GB of onboard storage, or just over 3.4GB for apps and games. There isn't enough space to install a half-decent game on the limited storage, but you can utilize all that time saved by working on your documents as the full Office suite — including Word, Excel, OneDrive, OneNote, and Skype — is bundled with the phone. I managed to install a total of 21 third-party apps (and zero games) before hitting the storage limit, which is 10% of the amount of apps I currently have installed on the similarly-priced Redmi Note 3.. There really isn't anything exciting about the Galaxy J2 2016.. The phone is also lacking when it comes to sensors. There's no ambient light sensor, no magnetometer, no gyroscope, no fingerprint sensor, no NFC, and the notification LED is at the back (more on that later). The display is limited to 2-finger multitouch, and there's no oleophobic coating. It takes an agonizing three hours to fully charge the phone.. The Galaxy J2 2016 is the first phone to feature Samsung's new Smart Glow notification system, which sees an LED ring around the camera sensor at the back. The LED ring pulses every time you receive a notification, and there's also the option to customize the notification color. You get several software-based features that leverage the LED ring, such as Selfie assist. The feature lets you use the rear camera to take a selfie, with the LED ring guiding you to the center of the frame. While it is a new approach to the standard notification light, Smart Glow's effectiveness is fairly limited as it is at the back of the phone, rendering it useless unless you place the phone face down. And like most of the Galaxy J2, there is a fundamental flaw to Smart Glow: it only works with select Samsung apps, and is not compatible with third-party apps, unlike Light Flow .. The J2 2016 fails to handle any processor-intensive tasks — if you're able to install anything in the first place.. The phone runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box, but it doesn't come with TouchWiz. What you get instead is a stripped-down version that's "engineered" with Turbo Speed Technology, a combination of app and memory management to prevent any slowdowns. As you can imagine, that isn't the case. There is a noticeable stutter during everyday tasks like web browsing, checking Facebook or Twitter, and even navigating the UI. A notable difference is the app drawer, which scrolls vertically, much like the Google Now Launcher. Samsung also baked in an ultra data saving mode that works system-wide, allowing you to save on data when streaming music or videos.. Samsung is known for recycling old hardware and passing it along as new, and it has managed to do that successfully over the years in India. Last year's Galaxy J2 went on to become the best-selling smartphone in the country, and in just a few months Samsung shipped 13 million units of the J2 2016. To put things into perspective, the J2 — which is available in select markets — outsold the standard variant of the Galaxy S7 .. The Galaxy J2 2016 is the perfect illustration of Samsung's marketing might. The company inundated the airwaves with commercials featuring Bollywood A-list celebrities and used its strong retail presence in tier 2 and tier 3 cities to aggressively promote the phone. The Indian market is saturated with plenty of phones that offer great value for money, notably the Redmi Note 3, the Moto G4 Plus, and the Lenovo K4 Note, but no vendor has Samsung's reach or marketing budget. With the likes of Xiaomi and LeEco duking it out in the online space, Samsung is continuing to sell underwhelming hardware by the millions to customers making their way online for the first time.. Even though the J2 2016 retails for the equivalent of $150, the outdated hardware means that it costs next to nothing for Samsung to make the phone. With other vendors selling at near manufacturing cost, Samsung is able to eke out much better profits, even in the budget segment. We will likely see a shift in the coming years, as Xiaomi has announced that it will expand into the offline space. OPPO and Vivo are also aggressively expanding into tier 2 and tier 3 cities, but it will be a challenge for these vendors to offer competitively-priced hardware while dealing with the overhead associated with offline sales.. If you're in the market for a budget phone, you should just go ahead and pick up the Redmi Note 3. For ₹9,999, the phone offers a metal chassis, and excellent hardware in the form of a 5.5-inch Full HD display, Snapdragon 650 SoC with newer Cortex A72 cores and Cortex A53 CPU cores, 2GB of RAM, 16GB storage, 16MP rear camera, 5MP front shooter, and a massive 4000mAh battery. There is a variant with 3GB of RAM as well as 32GB storage that is available for ₹11,999. If you can stretch your budget by a few thousand, the 32GB model is highly recommended..
