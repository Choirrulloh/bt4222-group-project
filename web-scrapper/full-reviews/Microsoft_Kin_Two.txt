Contact lists could only be copied from another phone by Verizon store employees. There was no way for the consumer to do this by any known means ( over the air , via a memory or SIM card , wirelessly via Bluetooth and vCard , or via direct USB cable connection). Kin had no calendar or appointment application, [41] nor any ability to sync with Outlook calendar or Google Calendar. [36] Some commentators suggested that a social phone should be able to share a social events calendar. Kin was unable to Instant Message (IM), or use any IM client, [41] which was considered odd for a phone built for messaging and aimed at the youth market. [36] It was discovered that the ROM inside the phones contained the foundation for an IM system supporting AOL Instant Messenger , Windows Live Messenger , and Yahoo! Messenger , but it was never made operational. It was speculated that future revisions of the software would have enabled instant messaging. There was no spelling correction or predictive text input.

Unboxing: Microsoft Kin Two - Windows Phone from Verizon by Sharp. Sharp KIN TWOm (Verizon Wireless) overview & user reviews. It is not to be confused with Pink Project .. Kin was a short-lived mobile phone line from Microsoft designed for users of social networking. [1] Microsoft described the phones' target demographic as men and women between ages 15 and 30. [2] It was manufactured by Sharp Corporation [3] and sold through Verizon Wireless. Microsoft invested two years and about US$1 billion developing the Kin platform, [5] [6] beginning with their acquisition of Danger Incorporated. [7] The Kin was based on Windows CE. The Kin ONE and TWO went on the market on May 14, 2010. Within two months, Verizon stopped selling the phones because of poor sales. [9] Microsoft scrapped its planned European release, stopped promoting the devices, ceased production, and reassigned the Kin development team to other projects. Microsoft updated its unsold Kin inventory with firmware that removed their social and web-based features, and in December 2010 offered these re-purposed units through Verizon stores as limited feature phones , the Kin ONEm and the TWOm. In January 2011, Microsoft shut down the kin.com website, which controlled most of the earlier phones' features.. The Kin TWOm was discontinued in August 2011; [11] unsold inventory could still be found for sale on deals sites as late as June 2013. 2 Original Kin series features. 2.9 Relationship to Windows Phone. 3 Kin "m" series features. 4.1 Kin ONE and ONEm. 4.2 Microsoft Kin TWO and TWOm made by Sharp for Verizon. The Kin project was first known by the codename Project Pink , and began under direction of Microsoft executive J Allard. [13] In order to gain a head start, Microsoft acquired Danger Incorporated , which built the Danger Hiptop/T-Mobile Sidekick , [7] in 2008 for a purchase price rumored to be around US$500 million. [14] [15] In September 2009, a ZDNet source reported that Project Pink would bring an entirely new software stack and services. [16] Some reports predicted that the new mobile phone platform would be based on the Zune media device. [17] The project was managed by Roz Ho , who coined the project name, "Pink", her favorite color. Engineers and project managers used the Twitter hash tag " #TMDP " to communicate in code with one another—the acronym expands to " Truly, Madly, Deeply (Pink) " for Roz Ho's favorite movie and the project name. Engineers were told they should feel passion for the project, "Truly, Madly, Deeply". When milestones were reached or there was a successful test, Roz Ho would cheer the team on by exclaiming "Truly, Madly, Deeply" in meetings or emails.. Kin was developed inside Microsoft's Premium Mobile Experiences (PMX) division by a group that included employees from Danger. [18] Handset manufacturers and network carriers were said to be initially enthusiastic about Kin, and vying with each other to be involved with the project. According to Engadget , there was jealousy and rivalry in Microsoft's executive ranks, and Windows Phone Senior Vice President Andy Lees managed to wrest control of the Kin project away from Allard, and move it under his Windows Phone division. [13] Danger's Sidekick, the predecessor to Kin, was based on the Java programming language , but Engadget says that Andy Lees wanted Kin to run an in-house Microsoft operating system. [13] Microsoft planned to base Kin on Windows Phone. Due to delays with Windows Phone, however, the software instead had to be based directly upon Windows CE. Engadget claims that Andy Lees lacked enthusiasm for the Kin project. [13] Nonetheless, Microsoft spent a further two years developing the Kin until its release in 2010. The unveiling of Microsoft Kin began when the company sent out invitations to select reporters for a mystery event in San Francisco on April 12, 2010. The tagline on the invitation said "It's time to share". However, just hours later a source confirmed that the event was about Project Pink (the official name not having been announced yet). [20] The event was held in a night club called Mighty and featured a presentation given by Robbie Bach , president of Microsoft's Entertainment and Device division. Microsoft was criticized for an online video advertisement for the phone that depicted a male teenager putting a Kin under his shirt to photograph his naked chest. He was then shown sending the image to a female teenager. The Consumer Reports group described the advertisement as a "downright creepy sequence," suggesting that it promoted sexting. In response, Microsoft deleted the "inappropriate" portion of the video. Microsoft executives told The New York Times that they were dismayed that Verizon Wireless staff were not promoting the phones actively enough. [23] After only forty-eight days on the market, Microsoft discontinued the Kin line on June 30, 2010 [24] and by mid-July 2010 Verizon had returned all their unsold phones to Microsoft. [9] Its planned European release on UK carrier Vodafone was canceled. “The Kin was a mistake from Day One,” Rob Enderle, principal analyst of Enderle Group, told eWeek magazine. “The extra time they took to convert the Kin from the Sidekick platform to Windows CE made it about a year and a half late to market, and the merger likely added another year and a half. That’s 1.5 to 3 years late depending on when you start the clock.” [27]. On November 18, 2010 Verizon Wireless's website confirmed that the Kin ONE and Kin TWO were back on the market with a reworked feature phone operating system, re-badged as Kin ONEm and Kin TWOm. Since the new phone did not use the kin.com website it did not require a data plan. The new version of the phone arrived at the Verizon stores in December of that year. [28] Along with the names and changed classification as feature phones rather than smartphones, the prices of the devices were slashed, with the Kin ONEm reduced from $50 to free, and the Kin TWOm reduced from $100 to $50, with a new two-year contract.. The new feature phone OS removed the web-based and social networking integration features such as Kin Loop, Kin Spot, and Kin Studio. [29] The newer "m" phones (identified by "m" next to the model number and two yellow dots on the corners) could be "downgraded" to the original firmware version via holding "r", "b", and "power" upon turning on the device (a procedure that also erases all the phone's stored data and settings).. The kin.com website was discontinued on January 2011, and all user pictures and other information stored on the website were deleted. Verizon offered a free trade-in to a 3G smartphone to all affected phone owners. [30] After the Kin website shut down, the original Kin ONE and TWO lost access to the same social features that were removed from the ONEm and TWOm, making them also essentially feature phones that did not require a data plan.. Microsoft described Kin devices as "social phones", [4] straddling the feature phone and smartphone markets, with an emphasis on social networking and sharing of content, but without downloadable apps or games. The home screen on Kin was called Loop , and served as an aggregator for social networking connections from Facebook , Twitter , Windows Live , and MySpace as well as web content from web feeds .. Commentators noted Loop's 15-minute delay for updates, which CNET's Ina Fried described as "odd". [32] PC World argued this delay was at odds with Microsoft's claim that the phone is "always-connected". [33] Users could not adjust this interval, [34] although updates could be manually triggered with an on-screen refresh button, or locking then unlocking the phone. [ citation needed ] Microsoft cited battery life and immature social networking APIs as reasons for the delay; Engadget speculated that Microsoft may have been using the delayed messaging to encourage Verizon to offer lower-priced data plans, which would be attractive to the platform's teenage target audience. Kin did not support uploading photos or videos to Twitter. [36] Retweets, direct messages, viewing single person updates, and opening Twitter links from the Loop were also not supported. Spot was a feature that allowed users to add an e-mail address or telephone number to an SMS or MMS , or to attach content (e.g., text, URLs or photos) to emails. The Spot was represented as an omnipresent colored dot near the bottom center of the screen. To add an address field, the user dragged a recipient's photo to the Spot, then clicked on the Spot, opening a page that allowed the user to create a new email, SMS or MMS. The Spot could also be used to set up e-mail attachments , by the user dragging the content to the Spot, then dragged the recipient's photo to the Spot, after which an email could be sent containing those attachments. [34] However, Kin did not support attachments to non-e-mail media such as MMS and could not be used to send content to social media sites. Content from the Kin phone, such as photos, videos and messages, was automatically synchronized to a cloud service called Kin Studio , and would then be accessible via a browser on other devices. The Kin Studio website was written in Silverlight and its appearance was similar to the Kin UI, even including a Spot for sharing content. [37] Kin Studio was shut down in January 2011.. The Kin Two included an 8 megapixel camera.. The Kin ONE had a five- megapixel camera with standard-definition video recording capabilities. The Kin TWO included an eight-megapixel camera with 720p video recording. Photos were automatically geocoded on the original phones, a feature disabled on the "m" phones. [38] There was no photo editing software for Kin. For media, Kin devices synced with Zune desktop software. In addition, the phones were compatible with Zune Pass. Much like contemporaneous Zune devices, Kin phones could also stream music over a WiFi connection in addition to 3G on the carrier's network. [40] For Mac users, Microsoft in collaboration with Mark/Space provided a media syncing tool that pulled audio and video files from iTunes and photos from iPhoto. [37] Kin did not support playing video from sites such as YouTube or Hulu , although the devices could watch YouTube videos from the browser through WiFi or 3G. Kin had no app store and no third-party apps could be installed on the phones. [41] PC World described this as "baffling". [33] Further, the web browser did not support Flash web applications, [42] and there were no games for the phones. [42] Microsoft had stated their intention to eventually merge the Kin and Windows Phone platforms, with downloadable apps then being available for the combined platform. Reviewers highlighted a number of notable omissions from Kin's initial feature set: [33]. In the United States , cellular telephone provider Verizon Wireless sold the Kin phones with a voice plan starting at $39.99 per month. An optional Zune Pass cost $14.99 per month for music access. After the kin.com website was discontinued in January 2011, the original Kin ONE and Kin TWO did not require a data plan, although the optional Zune Pass was still available.. The Microsoft Kin has been described as a "close cousin" to Windows Phone , [46] with shared user interface characteristics. "Both KIN and Windows Phone share common OS components, software and services. We will seek to align around a single platform for both products as well as consistent hardware specifications." [46]. Microsoft said that the underlying fundamentals of Kin and Windows Phone were held together by similar core technologies. Both operating systems ran the same Silverlight platform, [46] with Microsoft's stated intention being to eventually merge Windows Phone with Kin. In November 2010, Microsoft and Verizon re-launched the Kin phones, re-labeling them as feature phones with no required data plan. The prices of the phones also were slashed. Where the Kin TWO was formerly $100 on a two-year contract, the new Kin TWOm was offered at $20 on contract. Similarly, the Kin ONE, formerly $50 on a contract, was now $0 on contract.. The new firmware on the repurposed "m" phones removed several data-centric features of the operating system, including many of the devices' social elements such as the Loop home screen, the Spot, and access to the Kin Studio cloud storage site, which was shut down in January 2011. With the lack of a data plan requirement and lower prices up front, Microsoft and Verizon hoped to do what they originally planned: capture the teenage market.. One seemingly data-laden feature of the old Kin devices which remained available for the repurposed phones was Zune Pass , although it was now able to stream music only over Wi-Fi, even when customers had 3G data enabled, to conserve data. This was done to accommodate Verizon's new tiered data plans, which marked the end of unlimited data for users.. Users were also able to sync music, podcasts, TV shows, and movies to their Kin phones through the Zune software. Music could be downloaded directly to the phones as well, though only over Wi-Fi. Podcasts, TV shows, and movies could only be synced to the phone via the Zune Software on a Windows PC.. The "m" series added a calendar and a calculator application, to address complaints that these were missing functions that even the most basic feature phone typically has. Although the calendar application had basic features such as timed alerts and reminders, as well as day, month, and year views, it could not be synchronized with Microsoft Outlook , Microsoft Exchange , or even Windows Live Hotmail .. Along with the discontinued social networking features, the phones no longer geocoded pictures. Other features missing on the original version continued to be absent, including disallowing Bluetooth access for file transfer and wireless printing .. The Kin TWOm was unable to forward previously sent messages. Text messages were sent in a chat style format, making it unable to single out a specific text message.. "The KIN uses a proprietary browser made specifically for the KIN. No other browsers can be used or downloaded. Silverlight was used for the creation of the KIN studio, not the browser." [47] The browser identified itself as "IEMobile 6.12." The full user agent string was:.

Not really a smartphone, but priced like one. The Microsoft Kin Two isn't quite a smartphone, but it's a heady drug for Facebook obsessives.. The Microsoft Kin Two looks like a smartphone, and it's priced like a smartphone, but it isn't a smartphone. It's a messaging phone with extra benefits, which puts it in an uncomfortable place in the market. Had it been priced to compete with the LG enV3 ($79.99, ) and Samsung Alias 2 ($29.99, ), it would knock them out of the market. But Verizon is pricing Microsoft's two Kin phones like top-of-the-line smartphones such as the HTC Droid Incredible ($199.99, ) and the Palm Pre Plus ($29.99, )and in that company, the Kin phones look downright crippled.. Droid Incredible by HTC (Verizon Wireless). Most phones are either feature phonesappliances, basically, with a few optional servicesor smartphones, which grow through thousands of downloadable apps. The Kin phones, like the original iPhone , live in an uncomfortable middle ground. While they mimic many of the functions of smartphones, they lack the ability to download apps; they don't even play games.. View All 9 Photos in Gallery. That could be fine, because the Kin phones would drive forward the feature-phone state of the art, if they were priced right. Rather than being voice phones with a few data services tacked on, these are social-networking machines. But they aren't priced right; they're just as expensive, up front and per month, than more flexible and useful smartphones.. Microsoft is releasing two Kin phones with Verizon. The Kin Two is a larger model in a more traditional slider form factor, with a bigger screen and more memory. We cover the smaller Kin One in an associated review .. At 4.25 by 2.5 by .75 inches (HWD) and 4.7 ounces, the Kin Two looks like a traditional sliding smartphone. Slide the screen sideways to get a four-row QWERTY keyboard with well-separated keys. The phone is good-looking, but some of the buttons are awkwardly placed on the curve of the body; I had trouble pressing the camera and volume buttons accurately sometimes.. The Kin Two's 3.4-inch, 320-by-480 screen is what I'd consider the minimum size for a real smartphone experience nowadays; it's on par with the Droid Eris ($79.99, ) or Motorola Devour ($99.99, ). The device is speedy and responsive, thanks to the relatively cutting-edge NVIDIA APX2600 chipset within.. The Kin Two is a passable voice phone on Verizon Wireless's CDMA network; it also connects to the Internet via Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g. Sound in the earpiece is loud and clear, with lots of in-ear feedback of my own voice. Transmissions were marred by muddy voice quality and plenty of background noise. The speakerphone, on the other hand, is excellentunusually loud and sharp. The Kin Two paired easily with my Aliph Jawbone Icon ($99, ) Bluetooth headset to make calls, but there's no voice dialing. You can't use your own music as ringtones, either. Battery life was fine at just over five hours of talk time.. The Kin runs its own OS, which is similar to Windows Phone 7 , but isn't the same thing. For one thing, the Kin has no downloadable apps. What you see is what you get, plus whatever over-the-air updates Microsoft will choose to send down.. The Kin's interface doesn't look or work like anything else you've ever seen. It's a little like the Zune, but even that isn't going to help you.. When you hit the phone's wake-up button, you see what appear to be the handwritten words, "nice to meet you." Drag the corner of the page up to show the Loop, the Kin's "home page" of social networking updates, as bold and messy as a teenager's room. Swipe left to see the main menubig blocks of text and graphicsand swipe right to see your favorite people as a jigsaw-puzzle of photos.. The Kin ingests MySpace, Facebook and Twitter accounts, as well as Exchange, Gmail, Yahoo, Windows Live, and POP3/IMAP e-mail. Unfortunately, it doesn't do as much with those accounts as the competition does. Contacts come from Windows Live, MySpace, Facebook, and Exchange. You can't integrate someone's Twitter or Gmail information into their contact card if it isn't in Facebook.. Contact integration in general isn't as good as you'd see on an HTC phone like the Incredible or Droid Eris. There's no way to see all of your communication with someone from their contact card. You can swipe over to their Facebook Wall, but you don't get to see all the texts or e-mails you sent with the person connected to their address card.. The Loop, the Spot, and the Studio. Three features define the Kin experience: the Loop, the Spot, and the Studio. The Loop is the Kin's home page, and it should be a continuous feed of social-networking updates and your favorite RSS feeds. It's quite satisfying if you use Facebook and MySpace, and less so if you use Twitter, as your Twitter and Facebook contacts aren't matched up and so the updates seem to be coming from separate people. Tapping on an update lets you comment on a Facebook or MySpace message; for Twitter and RSS feeds, you can open them in the browser. E-mails and texts, annoyingly, are out of the Loopthey just don't appear on that screen.. The Spot lets you share stuff. As you wander through your phone experience, you can tap on itemsTwitter updates, photos, even Web pagesand dump them on the Spot, to be later packaged up and either uploaded to a social-networking service or sent by text or e-mail.. The Studio is the best thing about the Kin. Several of the things you do on the Kin are automatically backed up into a password-protected Web site that shows a timeline of what you've done on your phone: every phone call, every text message, every photo taken. It doesn't show your e-mails, but presumably you have those somewhere else. You can download your photos and messages, and prune your address book, from the Studio. The Studio isn't Microsoft-centric; while it requires Silverlight, I ran it in Firefox on both Windows Vista and Mac OS X 10.5.. The Kin's Internet Explorer-based Web browser is excellent, though it has a few usability quirks. Desktop pages display very accurately, and you can pinch to zoom and add visual bookmarks of your favorite pages. But since the browser seems to identify itself as Mobile IE, you often get stripped-down "mobile" versions of pages when the Kin is perfectly capable of showing full pages. As you could expect, the Web experience is a heck of a lot better on the large-screen Kin Two than on the small-screen Kin One.. I easily loaded and synced Exchange, Gmail, and Yahoo accounts, but more complicated HTML emails wouldn't view at all. The Kin phones also integrate Bing local and Web search through a dedicated button that also does a very limited local search, of contacts and apps only.. The Kin Two includes a built-in Zune HD ($199-$269, )for free!sort of. The phone has 8GB of built-in storage, and no memory card slot; I'd consider that the absolute minimum size for a primary media player.. Under an icon marked "Music & More," you can access a full set of Zune functions, and they work just like a Zune. To get music and video on or off the Kin, you sync it with the Zune Player on a PC or with upcoming Mac software that Microsoft pledges to make available soon. I found music, videos, podcasts and photos synced two ways, and they sounded good both over wired and Bluetooth headsets. Even HD videos played well, scaled down to the Kin Two's screen size.. The Kin Two's 8-megapixel camera includes a flash and geotags photos with your location (even indoors), but I had real trouble getting non-blurry photos out of it. Part of the problem is the extremely poorly-placed camera button. If you put one finger on the button and the other finger on the other side of the phone, as is natural, you're covering the camera lens. The alternative is to move one of your hands, and then the camera wobbles a lot. When I did, rarely, get a sharp picture, it was bright, clear, and free of artifactsI wish I had been able to take more. I had better results with the Kin Two's 720p video camera, which took smooth if somewhat blown-out videos.. A short list of what's missing: no apps, no instant messaging, no calendar, and no GPS navigation. With the right service plan, the Kin phones could still have cleaned up. Send a bunch of teenagers into a Verizon store and give them a choice between a Kin Two, an enV3, and an Alias 2, and I'm confident that they'd pick the Kin.. I like the Kin Two more than the Kin One because of its larger screen, but smartphones still run circles around this gadget. The HTC Incredible and Motorola Devour both have better social-networking support; even the BlackBerry Curve 8530 ($29.99, ) will take your Facebook and raise you a BlackBerry Messenger. And all smartphones have lots of games and add-on programs to make them even better. So why is Verizon putting the Kin Two on the same $30 a month data plan as the superior HTC Incredible and Palm Pre Plus? A Verizon rep let the sad reason slip: because Kin owners will use the Internet.. All that backing-up, uploading and sharing uses a lot of Internet, and the days of cheap Internet are passing. The Kin is a symbol of the higher monthly bills we're all going to pay as we watch terrified wireless carriers, afraid that people are going to use their limited and precious Internet, try to pump prices up to protect themselves.. At the price Verizon is charging, it's hard for me to recommend the Kin Two over the Palm Pre Plus or other top smartphones for anyone other than total Facebook obsessives. The Kin Two looks enough like a smartphone that I suspect a real smartphone is what Kin Two buyers really want.. Continuous Talk Time: 5 hours 7 minutes. Compare the Microsoft Kin Two (Verizon Wireless) with several other mobile phones side by side.. Bottom Line: The Microsoft Kin Two isn't quite a smartphone, but it's a heady drug for Facebook obsessives..

more ... more .... more ... more .... Release date: May 6, 2010. View all photos (16). Click to read the full review. Based on 11 User reviews. Lacks microSD slot for storage expansion. Thick body (0.64 inches inches). Low pixel density screen (170 ppi). The Microsoft KIN TWO is the more powerful brother of KIN ONE (and also the bulkier) with capacitive HVGA display, 8MP camera with HD 720p video capture and flash, as well as 8GB of storage space.. Microsoft KIN ONE and TWO Review Microsoft KIN TWO manual. Dimensions: 4.38 x 2.36 x 0.64 inches (111 x 60 x 16 mm). Weight: 4.70 oz (133 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 320 x 480 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Talk time: 6.08 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 9.7 days (232 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. CDMA - Code Division Multiple Access. A technique of multiplexing, also called spread spectrum, in which analog signals are converted into digital form for transmission. For each communication channel, the signals are encoded in a sequence known to the transmitter and the receiver for that channel. The foremost application is digital cellular phone technology from QUALCOMM that operates in the 800MHz band and 1.9GHz PCS band. CDMA phones are noted for their excellent call quality and long battery life.. Notifications: Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 12 Apr 2010. Shopping information MSRP price: $ 100. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Make no mistake: the Kin One and Two are coming into the world as the black sheep of the phone industry, and Microsoft would have it no other way. Straddling the fence somewhere between a dedicated smartphone and high-spec featurephone, they've been tricky to understand since the day they were first leaked (even Microsoft seemed unsure of what the devices meant until very recently). Billed as a Gen-Y (the "upload generation") social networking tool -- and sold in advertisements as the gateway to the time of your young, freewheeling life -- the Kin phones have admittedly been something of head-scratcher to those of us in the gadget world. Built atop a core similar (but not identical) to the Windows Phone 7 devices coming later this year, manufactured by Sharp, and tied into partnerships with Verizon and Vodafone, the phones dangerously preempt Microsoft's reemergence into the smartphone market. Hell, they're even called Windows Phones. But the One and Two aren't like any Windows Phones you've ever seen. With stripped-down interfaces, deep social networking integration, and a focus on very particular type of user, Microsoft is aiming for something altogether different with Kin. So do these devices deliver on that unique, social experience that Redmond has been selling, or does this experiment fall flat? We've taken both handsets for a spin, and we've got all the answers in our full review... so read on to find out!. Gallery: Kin One and Two review | 62 Photos.

Decent hardware keyboard720p video recordingKin Studio cloud syncing. Uneven and buggy UILack of applications, even IMData plan pricing too high for phone of this class. Hardware The Kin One and Two should look a little familiar -- they come off like mutated cousins of the Palm Pre. The One is short and squat, sort of disc shaped, with a smaller display that slides down into the center of the handset; the Two, meanwhile, is a larger, elongated device with a wide landscape keyboard. Both devices feature capacitive touchscreen displays (a 2.6-inch, 320 x 240 QVGA screen on the One and a 3.4-inch, 480 x 320 HVGA version for the Two) with thick, plastic coatings. Around the sides, the phones both feature the same complement of buttons: volume rockers, a dedicated camera key, a sleep / power button, plus a "back" button on the lower faces of the devices. The phones use a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, take micro-USB cables, and have cameras equipped with LED flashes on their backs. From an industrial design standpoint, there isn't a lot that's laudable here -- but there's also not too much to complain about. As we said, the designs themselves don't feel tremendously original, but the company is ripping off good material. The One has a little more character than the Two, largely due to its uncommon size and use of the rarely-seen portrait slider mechanism. It's also got a little color highlight (well, white) around the screen when it's closed, giving it a kind of 60's Formica countertop feel that we like. Both handsets do seem a little iffy on the build quality; the slider mechanisms feel fine, but there are lots of open spaces and notches that make the devices seem less rugged than we would prefer -- the Pre and the G1 have that same problem. On the Two, the display is coated with a thicker plastic element that almost melts around the edges, giving it a dipped-in-shellac appearance that's refreshingly retro. Both phones have slide-out hardware keyboards -- a welcome sight. The One seemed a bit mushier to our thumbs, and the extreme curve of the keyboard made typing a little more of a challenge. The Two has a much clickier and pleasant keyboard, though the narrowness of the keys might be troubling for users with larger hands. The keyboards were both usable, but we do take issue with the lettering, which is difficult to read because it runs off of the sides of the individual keys. Also, the special characters are quite difficult to see, and on the software side, there is zero text correction or prediction, even for simple words like "isn't." You're on your own here. In your hand, both devices feel light but not without substance, and the matte material used on the backing is pleasant enough to the touch. Neither one of these phones is going to stop you in your tracks when you see it, but the designs are also quite approachable and likable, so points go to Microsoft on that. Internals Both the One and the Two sport the Tegra APX2600 CPU -- the same as in the Zune HD, so you've got plenty of horsepower -- and have 256MB of DDR RAM on-board. The One has a paltry 4GB of storage for your pics, music, and video, while the Two ups the game to 8GB... Neither of the devices support microSD, so if you were planning on some memory expansion, look elsewhere. The devices have light and proximity sensors, an accelerometer, and GPS chips inside, along with 802.11b/g, EvDO Rev. A, and Bluetooth 2.1 (which supports A2DP and AVRCP profiles). In our testing, we didn't see any remarkable performance out of the Tegra chips, though we'd bet dollars to donuts that they're running a little less hot so the phones can suck a little more life out of these batteries (1240 mAh for the One, and 1390 mAh for the Two). Overall, you won't be shocked by the performance or specs of these devices, but you shouldn't feel cheated either -- the Kins are fairly modern phones as far as the guts are concerned. Displays The Kin One and Two don't have particularly notable displays, though they get the job done well enough. Thanks to the light sensors in the phones, when you first boot up you'll find yourself in auto brightness mode, which for us was way, way too dim. Digging down we eventually found a way to switch to manual settings (more on that in a little bit). The display on the One was about as squashed as you'd expect it to feel. Luckily for Microsoft, there's not a lot of content being pushed at any one time, but we still felt like we were squinting every time we had to try to make out text on the screen. It's not just low resolution -- the pixel density doesn't seem too tight either. On the Two things felt a little better. Again, the Kin UI doesn't really need a lot of space, but it's nice to have more room, especially when it comes to dealing with email. Both of the displays seemed a bit washed out to us, and colors weren't quite as vibrant as we would have liked. The touch sensitivity of the screens seemed up to snuff with their smartphone contemporaries. We did experience a few moments of sluggishness or unresponsiveness, though we're certain that that has a lot more to do with the software than the hardware. Pinch-to-zoom and other familiar gestures (like lots of swiping) generally went off without a hitch; touch response was definitely improved from when we'd first played with the phones, and it gives us hope that the Windows Phone 7 experience will be even better. The Kin displays work and look fine for the most part, but we didn't walk away feeling stunned by the screens. Camera Now Microsoft has been making a big deal out of the cameras on these phones, having equipped the One with a 5 megapixel shooter, and the Two with an 8 megapixel version that does... Why HD video might be important to the teen audience the company seems to be trying to appeal to here is anyone's guess, but we digress. We want to stress that the Kin ads show off a lot of heavy camera use, so we get the impression that the company intends picture taking to be a big part of how Kin users utilize their phones. So how are these memory-capturing tools when put to the test? Honestly... For starters, just the act of trying to take a photo with the hardware buttons on these phones is really quite uncomfortable; somehow, both the One and Two seem to force your hand into a position where you're blocking the lens with a finger or two. Once you do get a grip you like, pressing that button yields inconsistent results. On the One, it's usually good for taking a picture after a firm press, but sometimes there's no reaction at all, while on the Two, it tends to focus in and out and then never snap a photo. We had to press unreasonably hard on the key, and the results were usually marred by the movement of the camera... which was a result of pressing too hard.. Gallery: Kin Two camera shots | 26 Photos. Once we could get the phones to snap a picture, the results were mixed at best. With the flash on or set to auto, the pictures ended up almost universally blown out, sometimes just revealing themselves on review as a white blur. Both the One and Two are equipped with autofocus lenses, though the One seemed to struggle much less with focusing in on subjects. On the other hand, its images looked more washed out to us. To sum up, taking still photos with both Kin devices was a frustrating, unrewarding affair that yielded more bad than good. Perhaps if the speed gets cranked up and that flash can be tamed in a future revision, the results may improve -- but for now, the moment you'll be capturing the most is just after something really good happened. Or just a flash of light. On the video front, things did look a little bit up, especially in the case of the Kin Two. As we mentioned, it's capable of shooting 720p video, and what we saw wasn't completely cringe-worthy. Still, there is some nasty compression going on (which you have no control over), but on a bright day, we captured some pretty handsome shots which seemed well balanced as far as colors were concerned. The One and Two have image stabilization, but it wasn't exactly cranking on overdrive, and we had some really, really troubling wind noise (as you can hear on the video). Besides those minor problems, you can safely leave the Flip at home if you've got the Two in your pocket... just know that you can't up HD video to the Kin Studio -- you have to sync them with Zune on your PC, which goes firmly against Microsoft's mantra with these products that everything you capture is instantly whisked into the cloud. More on that in a moment. Sound quality / Speakerphone So we'll just be straight with you here -- we didn't get the overwhelming impression that Microsoft expects you to be talking a lot on these phones. If the literature, ads, and general functionality of the One and Two tell us anything, it's that phone calls are dead, and everyone is Facebooking like it's going out of style. Whether or not that attitude had any impact on the quality of the earpiece or speakerphone here is anyone's guess... but they certainly align perfectly, in that the sound quality of the phone seems like an afterthought. The earpiece itself was decent enough, but we thought the speakerphone left quite a bit to be desired. The Kin certainly isn't the only phone out there with poor speakerphone sound though, so this really didn't come as much of a shock to us. Software Okay, this is the big fish. The Kin wasn't designed for early adopters of the most cutting edge hardware -- that's obvious. What it was designed to do, however, was work really well doing a couple of key tasks, most of them centered around social networking, photos and video, and some overarching concept of capturing your mobile / digital life in a whole new and easy manner. Lofty goals indeed for a product like this, and unfortunately for everyone, Microsoft misses the mark by a long shot. The user interface of the Kin is laid out in a deceptively simple manner. When you first boot the phone, you're asked for a username and password and then taken to your home screen. Let's talk for a moment about that login process: you may think that the Kin, like most modern phones, would be asking you for a preexisting username and password from something like Gmail or Yahoo! so that you can pull in your email account and perhaps contacts. It certainly seems like that's what's happening when you first turn the phone on -- however, that's not the score. What's actually happening is that you're creating a Windows Live account, one which the phone uses to sync your Studio data back and forth with. You actually are never given the opportunity to add a Gmail or Yahoo! account for anything but plain vanilla email (unlike with webOS, Android, or the iPhone). Therefore, if you're a user of one of these wildly popular services, your only hope for adding your contacts is dumping a .csv file from your account, then uploading that to your Live account, then praying that somehow the magical contact fairy makes your dreams a reality. We're still waiting for our Live account to sync those contacts to our phone or Studio. Now, back to the main phone operation. The home screen (or screens, rather) consist of three panels which you gesture left or right to get into and out of. In the center is the "Loop," where you see Twitter, MySpace, Facebook, and RSS updates; off to the right you have your favorite contacts, basically a grid of people you like talking to; on the left is your "apps" page, which contains links to your camera, browser, email, and so on. So far so good, right? In addition to your three main pages, you've got a little clock in the right hand corner at all times, as well as a "recent" tab in the left corner -- both bring up pop-up menus, the latter giving you quick access to recent applications, and the former showing you the phone's battery life status and network connections. Oh, and down in the middle of the phone is a little dot called the "Spot" -- let's try and explain what that does. The Spot is meant to be a point on the device where you can drag all manner of content, and then share that content with friends. For instance, you might want to send a text message to a group of friends. Easy: just drag their faces onto the Spot, then click on it. You'll be taken to a page where you can send an email or an MMS or SMS message. You can also do more complex actions, like drag a Facebook or Twitter message, a URL, and a photo into this area, then drag your friends into the Spot and send them an email -- only an email -- with all that content. It seems like a good idea, but in practice, it makes very little sense. A video demo shown on the Kin site offers a scenario where you might drag a concert venue, a band's MySpace page, a few photos you've taken, and a friend's status update to the Spot and then send an email about going to show... but no one really works like that, and the Kin UI doesn't make it any more logical. It's actually a really cumbersome way to communicate -- dragging one abstract thing towards another abstract thing doesn't make more sense than deciding to send an email, typing a few addresses, and throwing some pictures or links into the message... You can't share those kind of mixed messages on Facebook or Twitter or MySpace either -- it's strictly for email. The more complex your combos get, the harder it is to get them out. One thing we couldn't do with the Spot was share music (or even a link or snippet) from the Zune app. We wanted to drag a song to the Spot, but there is no Spot in the Zune player! So much for "the social," right? But the obtuseness of this user experience doesn't stop with the Spot -- it permeates the entire interface as though decisions about how things should work were made almost arbitrarily, without anyone stopping to test them in the real world. The Twitter implementation is a great example of that. You can add your Twitter account to the phone and see updates from people you follow, and you can update your status from the top of the Loop... but that's all you can do. You can't retweet something, you can't send a direct message, you can't go to single person's feed to see all their updates, and you can't even open a link in a Twitter message from the Loop! To do something as simple as look at an image someone has tweeted, you must first click on the tweet, then click "open in browser," then wait for the tweet to load on twitter.com , then finally click the link to see the image or URL. It's a shocking omission for a phone which claims to be about nothing but social networking. The basic premise of the Loop also presented problems. The idea is that you can quickly glance at all of your friends' updates and respond to them quickly, but it soon becomes a daunting task just trying to understand who is saying what. The average Facebook user has 130 friends (we tested with accounts of over 700 and 200), Twitter adds noise to the mix, MySpace compounds it... and the phone only updates every 15 non-user-adjustable minutes. Sometimes less! What happens is that you can't really keep track of any conversations, and your friends (or in our case, lots of people you don't really know) become less about their individual voices, and more about random shouts in a big crowded room. The Kin might be more appropriately called the Facebook or MySpace phone, since it seems to want to play nice with those two sites more than anything, but even when trying to comment on something on Facebook, upload a picture, or update our status, we ran into frustrating timeouts and stalls that made us want to throw the phone across the room. Overall, it's just a deeply, deeply frustrating and inconsistent experience. Beyond the social networking aspects of the phone, we also take issue with the browser, which is abysmally slow and buggy (it consistently crashed while trying to load any complex web pages like Engadget), and the email client, which seemed to have trouble displaying even the most rudimentary HTML messages. The only real saving grace on the software side is the Zune app, which is identical to the Zune HD interface, but allows you to download music and movies over the air (yes, even over 3G), which is almost worth the price of admission. We had some Zune issues too, like the aforementioned lack of the Spot, the fact that it only displays in portrait mode (except searches, which then forces you to do some weird rotating back and forth), and a situation with certain albums we tried to download which were "computer only" -- meaning it didn't matter if we had a Zune Pass or not. We wish we had more to say on the "other" parts of the phone, but there's just not much there. No app store, no IM client, no games, no calendar... not even visual voicemail or some carrier-hitched GPS app. Teens still play games, don't they? Microsoft says that down the road the Windows Phone and Kin ecosystems will merge, yielding software for these devices... but they may be a long wait from what we can tell. While using the One and Two we found ourselves consistently confused or surprised by how many bad little interface problems there are. Not only does the phone make it hard to do simple tasks -- and not only are the social networking features poorly implemented -- but the handsets are often sluggish, hiccupy, and downright crash-prone. We were told by the devices on more than one occasion that we needed to restart (while performing basic tasks), and often it would just throw us a blank screen while we waited for the device to come back from whatever tragic internal situation was occurring. It would be wonderful to say more good about the phone's UI -- but we just can't. The Studio One aspect of this family of devices that does show a lot of promise is the Kin Studio -- essentially an online repository of all of your SMS and MMS messages, call logs, photos, videos (non-HD, one minute long clips), contacts, RSS feeds, as well as your social networking service updates. The Studio interface is all handled by Silverlight, so it's fairly robust. We can definitely see a future where not only is your phone kept backed up in this fashion, but you also have access to voicemail, email, your music and video collection, and other bits of content you want to keep accessible (something like Dropbox, but integrated). It's a great start, but of course it's hindered by the devices themselves -- it's hard to become invested in the ecosystem of the Kin phones when their actual performance is so off-putting. It should also be noted that the syncing process takes a bit of time, and you never really know when your content will be available, which is a rather annoying aspect of the whole experience we hope Microsoft corrects. You should have some control over when and how you send your photos and video to the cloud. Battery life Microsoft told us that its goal was for users to be able to take off for a weekend road trip with these things and leave their chargers behind. We didn't have a long time to test battery life, but in our experience both the One and the Two held up fairly well under heavy use. In particular, the One was left off the charger quite a bit, yet still managed to go for more than two days with sporadic use. We'll chalk the better performance up to that heavily controlled sync schedule (once every 15 minutes at the most). Pricing / Wrap-up When we first saw the Kin phones, the editors at Engadget (and lots of other folks in the industry) said that price would be the big question when it came to these phones. If they really were destined for the hands of tweens and teens, then they would have to be offered at a price that was attractive to their parents, which means something decidedly below the standard smartphone deal: a device for $100 or $200, plus a pricey data plan. There seemed to be a general sentiment that if Verizon and Microsoft could partner on something that hit a lower price point for the devices coupled with a bargain-rate data package, they just might have a foot in the door, despite the obvious limitations of the device. Even if that were true -- if a great price could cancel out the faults of these phones (which it can't) -- Microsoft and Verizon have failed there as well. The One and Two are being offered for $49.99 and $99.99 respectively after a $100 mail-in rebate... and they must be coupled with a standard Verizon smartphone plan , which clocks in at $29.99 a month. We were frankly shocked when we heard the pricing schemes (you also need a voice plan, of course, which will set you back another $39.99 monthly). To offer what is clearly so much less than a smartphone with a smartphone data plan is insulting to consumers, and doubly insulting considering who it looks like these phones are aimed at. If you're going to shell out this kind of money each month, it would be foolish to even consider these devices given the much, much better options out there. Even counting out the iPhone or similar devices on other carriers (many of which are rather attractive), just take a look at the offerings on Verizon right now. You could get a Pre Plus -- an immeasurably better phone with much of the social networking integration of the Kin devices -- for $29 coupled with a smartphone and voice plan. Or you could spend a little more upfront and get a BlackBerry Tour 9630 , Droid , Incredible , or Droid Eris -- all much, much better phones with excellent social networking options. The list really goes on -- and again, if you were a teenager or young adult with all of these great options laid out before you, the idea of choosing this severely limited device which doesn't do a single thing better than even the most basic Android device is kind of crazy. Microsoft has hinted that it wants to shake up the text-centric featurephone market with Kin, but guess what? You categorically cannot even fathom to do that when you're charging for smartphone data. And that about sums it up -- there are much better choices for much less money on the market, and Microsoft hasn't demonstrated to us why you would choose this phone over those. You could argue that the 720p video recording is a hook, but our results weren't that outstanding, and we don't know anyone who needs HD video on a phone so desperately that they're willing to overlook all of these faults. In the end, we're left with two orphan devices -- phones that feel like they should have been killed before they made it to market, but somehow slipped through. It's clear to us from conversations we've had with Microsoft that there are people at the company with good ideas about what phones should and shouldn't do, but we don't feel the Kin is representative of those ideas. The execution (or lack thereof) on these products makes us legitimately concerned about what the company will do with Windows Phone 7. We can only hope that the similarities between those devices and the Kin handsets don't stretch much further than the "Windows Phone" label, because in our estimation, Kin is one side of the family that needs to be disowned... kin , kin one , kin phone , kin phones , kin two , KinOne , KinPhone , KinPhones , KinTwo , microsoft , microsoft kin , microsoft kin one , microsoft kin two , MicrosoftKin , MicrosoftKinOne , MicrosoftKinTwo , review , video , windows phone , windows phones , WindowsPhone , WindowsPhones.

The Microsoft Kin, Microsoft's widely panned line of semi-smartphones for text-happy teenagers, is dead - or at least it doesn't have a future as a standalone product..

The Microsoft Kin, Microsoft's widely panned line of semi-smartphones for text-happy teenagers, is dead - or at least it doesn't have a future as a standalone product.. Microsoft on Wednesday released a statement suggesting that it's cutting bait on the Windows Phone 7 spinoff and folding the project's staff and technologies into the main body of Windows Phone 7.. Here's the official word from Microsoft:. "We have made the decision to focus on our Windows Phone 7 launch and we will not ship Kin in Europe this fall as planned. Additionally, we are integrating our Kin team with the Windows Phone 7 team, incorporating valuable ideas and technologies from Kin into future Windows Phone releases. We will continue to work with Verizon in the U.S. For now, it seems like Verizon Wireless will continue to sell Kin phones. But with the Kin team essentially disbanded, it's hard to see future updates and support for the line being a priority within Microsoft.. "Kin is still an important part of our portfolio," Verizon Wireless spokeswoman Brenda Raney said.. Kin may not have been been selling well on Verizon Wireless. Spurious rumors about sales numbers aside, Verizon recently cut the price of both Kin models .. Microsoft's change of direction may be related to recent changes in its executive team. In May, Robbie Bach and J Allard, two top executives in Microsoft's mobile and devices team, left the company. Andy Lees took over management of Microsoft's device strategy, reporting directly to CEO Steve Ballmer.. When we first reviewed the Kin One and Kin Two , I was concerned that they couldn't find a place in the market. Acting like feature phones but priced like full smartphones, they offer high monthly fees, no apps, and mediocre social-networking integration.. Microsoft told me at launch that it considered the Kin would be a way to address a younger, more social target market than the "life maximizers" who would be picking up Windows Phone 7 devices. Kin phones could be lower spec, and less expensive than Windows Phone 7 units.. Hands On with the Microsoft Kin Phones. Who's Afraid of the Microsoft Kin? The Carriers.

[ Further reading: The best Android phones for every budget. The first reviews of Microsoft's Kin phones are in, and while critics don't agree on whether the phones are a success, they do agree on one thing: the price of Verizon Wireless' data plans could doom the phones to obscurity.. Microsoft headed off the beaten path with Kin, designing phones that emphasize text messages, status updates and e-mails packed with photo and video, in a free flowing interface that combines your entire universe into one feed. After reading Kin reviews from PCWorld , Engadget , Gizmodo , All Things D and PCMag , I've concluded that the Kin One and Two are deeply flawed phones with some ideas that work. The dealbreaker is Verizon's mandatory $30-per-month smartphone data plan, appalling given the Kin's limitations.. The Kin's hardware seems respectable, at least in terms of specs. Nvidia's Tegra APX2600 powers the phone, and while storage is tight at 4 GB for the Kin One and 8 GB for the Kin Two, most of your data gets backed up to the cloud (more on that below). Both phones have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 2.1.. In practice, the gripes with Kin's hardware pile up. Gizmodo says the main user interface is sluggish, and PCWorld noticed lag even when typing. PCMag had qualms with the Kin One in particular, blasting its weak speakerphone and tiny display. Several reviewers noted that 5-megapixel and 8-megapixel cameras on the Kin One and Two, supposedly a central feature, create dim or blurry photos in low light and washed out photos when flash is involved. Engadget noted that the positioning of the camera buttons on both phones tend to make your hand block the lens. PCWorld is the dissenting opinion, praising photos as sharp, with powerful flash to boot.. Classifying the Kin as a smartphone is questionable given the things you can't do with it , no matter what Verizon says. You can't watch Web video, you can't send photos or video on Twitter, the Web browser doesn't support tabs, there's no native calendar or ability to sync other calendars, and there's no native GPS for accomplishing the very social function of meeting up with friends in real life. All of these limitations make the $30-per-month data plan requirement hard to swallow.. So, what can the Kin do? Its essence is the "The Loop," a running feed of e-mails, text messages, status updates, and RSS feeds from your favorite Web sites. Complementing this ticker is "The Spot," a dot at the bottom of the screen that lets you pull in photos, video and Web links. Once your media is gathered, you can send it out to the world by text, e-mail or social network. To say it's a matter of preference is probably a safe bet.. The one thing that drew unanimous praise from critics is Kin Studio, which actually has little to do with the phone itself. This desktop app automatically pulls photo, video, text messages, contacts, and news feeds into the cloud. Phone gets lost? Friend grabbed your phone and deleted the more unflattering photos? No problem, everything's stored away with no effort from the user. Windows Phone 7 needs this feature.. Pre-orders for both the Kin One and Two start on May 5 for $50 and $100 respectively, with a two-year contract with Verizon Wireless. The phones will be available online starting May 6, and will reach Verizon stores on May 13.. To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed..

We partnered with Chipworks to bring you a teardown of the all-new Microsoft Kin Two!. The Microsoft Kin Two is the Kin One's taller brother, and is manufactured by Sharp Electronics.. This teardown is not a repair guide. To repair your Microsoft Kin Two, use our service manual .. Photos courtesy of Chipworks .. The Kins are Microsoft's first foray into cellphones. As noted on the back of the Kin Two, they're very sharp Verizon phones, ones that have windows on them.. They weren't sharp at all, nor were any windows to be found. The top of the phone features a headphone jack, while a Micro USB port can be found on the bottom.. The Kin Two is 19.05 mm thick. That makes for a bigger bulge in the pants, given that the thickness of the iPhone and Motorola Droid are 12.3 mm and 13.7 mm, respectively.. Enter "Is that a Kin Two, or are you happy to see me?" jokes here.. Sliding the screen upwards reveals a relatively simple keyboard. No fancy D-pad, just one "alternate" text button. Judging from the look of the keyboard, Microsoft's marketing this phone to the 12-year-old txting crowd.. The back side reveals the lovely 8MP camera and LED flash.... ...And the back cover comes off to reveal several screws underneath!. It looks like it's pretty easy to exchange the battery in the Kin Two. With the two sliding halves of the phone separated, you can easily see the odd-shaped springs that keep the phone either fully open or fully closed.. The connector highlighted in yellow is responsible for sending data between main board and the display, microphone, speaker, and touchscreen.. Several rows of pressure contacts help exchange data between the main board and the external buttons, microphone, speaker, and antennas embedded in the outer case.. The camera is the Sony IMX046, which is fabricated using a 90 nm CMOS process. The camera's resolution is 8.11 effective megapixel (8 active megapixel), 1.4 μm sized pixel, 1/3.2" optical format. Samsung was the first to use this camera in the M8800.. An LED flash placed next to the camera lens on the rear case sheds some light on night shots.. For all its pixels, the camera only eats up about .5 cm 3 of space inside the Kin.. Fix Kits starting at $16.99. Separating the two halves of the display assembly reveals a bunch of cables connecting the microphone, speaker, display, and digitizer to the main board.. The digitizer is a Synaptics unit, and the main controller chip is labeled T1021A 1 0939 ACOM755.. The front and back of the main board.. The camera is nestled quite nicely in a little cutout near the top of the board.. When buttons are pressed on the QWERTY keyboard, they simply bridge the connection between the gold ring and its center dot.. If only the steel shield supports were gone so we could view the board unobstructed.... If you ever want to use your phone again, don't remove those shield supports that were soldered to the logic board.. Texas Instruments' TPS-6586 Advanced Power Management Unit controls power onboard the Kin and takes care of charging its lithium battery.. The Wolfson Micro WM8903 is a low power stereo codec with all sorts of fancy features like programmable audio path control sequences, both pseudo-differential and fully-differential analog inputs, a dynamic range controller, and all sorts of other technical jibber jabber.. Was ist das? It's actually an Nvidia Tegra processor, buried beneath an Numonyx package seen on the surface.. Samsung's moviNAND chip supplies the 8GB of storage space for the Kin.. The moviNAND package can transfer data at speeds up to 52 MB/s.. The Qualcomm QSC6085 package delivers up to 1.8 Mbps reverse and 3.8 Mbps forward speed on CDMA-2000 networks.. The small silicon chip pictured appears to be a Texas Instruments WL1271 for WLAN and possibly Bluetooth connectivity.. Avago's ACFM-7103 PCS/Cellular/S-GPS Quintplexer simplifies mobile applications designed for simultaneous voice service and GPS positioning.. Another Avago chip, the ACPM-7353, provides dual band power amplification for cellular and PCS connectivity.. STMicroelectronics LIS331-DL inertial sensor (3-axis digital MEMS accelerometer).. Another chips near the camera connector were not readily identifiable, but they most likely help with transferring data between the camera and the main board.. AKM's AK8973 3-axis Electronic Compass.

IDG News Service |. Nvidia to Put New Tegra, Ion Chips in Production. Microsoft's Kin Two Carries Aging Nvidia Tegra Chip. Nvidia: Tegra 2 Smartphones Coming in Fourth Quarter. When will graphics card prices drop? - Ask the nerds. [ Further reading: The best Android phones for every budget. The first smartphones based on Nvidia's low-power Tegra chips will soon be here, in the form of the new Kin devices announced by Microsoft earlier on Monday.. The first Tegra chips were introduced close to two years ago and have found their way into portable media players including Microsoft's Zune HD and Samsung's M1. They haven't yet appeared in smartphones, however, though that will change next month when Microsoft's Kin devices appear.. Device makers were initially cautious about putting Tegra in smartphones but are gaining confidence in the chips, said Nvidia spokesman Bruce Chan.. "It takes a while to take mobile designs to the market," he said. More Tegra smartphones will ship later this quarter, according to Chan, though he declined to say which device makers will introduce them.. Nvidia, which is best known for its graphics cards, launched Tegra to compete in the mobile market against companies like Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and Intel. Nvidia says Tegra can bring advanced graphics capabilities with the low power consumption needed by mobile phones. The Tegra chips include an Arm-based processor, a GeForce graphics core and other components.. The Kin One and the Kin Two , launched by Microsoft in San Francisco Monday morning, are touch-screen phones aimed at younger people who want quick access to social-networking services like Facebook and Twitter. The Kin One has a 5-megapixel camera and the Kin Two an 8-megapixel camera.. They both include Nvidia's Tegra APX 2600 chip for a high-quality multimedia experience, including 720p high-definition video playback and recording, Chan said.. The APX 2600 is starting to age, however, and smartphones based on the next-generation Tegra 2 should be out by the end of the year. Just last week, an Nvidia executive said the first Tegra 2 smartphones would start shipping in the fourth quarter.. Nvidia officials have said Tegra 2 chips are close to four times faster than their predecessors and will be able to play 1080p high-def video. By the end of the year device makers will be offering phones based on both generations of Tegra chips, Chan said.. Tegra 2 is also targeted at tablets --larger devices with screens between 5 inches and 15 inches.. Nvidia is entering a crowded market for smartphone chips and will be up against more established players like Qualcomm and TI, who also offer chips based on Arm designs, said Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at Insight 64.. Tegra's strong graphics capabilities could be a standout feature for device makers, he said. There is a growing demand for rich-media applications on mobile devices, and the second-generation Tegra chips will handle full HD content, he noted.. Nvidia is also competing with Intel, another upstart in the mobile-phone market, which is due to start shipping its Moorestown smartphone chip later this year. Intel has already shown an LG Electronics GW990 smartphone based on Moorestown.. But Nvidia has an edge because most smartphones today use Arm-based chips, while Intel has to convince device makers to use its x86 designs, Brookwood said.. Though some users might wait for Tegra 2 devices to hit the market , Nvidia had to start somewhere to build confidence around the chip design, Brookwood said.. "There's always going to be something better coming in a year," Brookwood said. "If you decide to wait for the next big thing, you will be waiting forever.".

CNET también está disponible en español.. The Kin Two's conventional form factor is offset by its higher quality components, not only is its screen larger, but it has double the storage and a higher-res camera than its baby brother, the Kin One.. by 21 October 2010 11:13 pm AEDT. Follow this link for a closer look at the Microsoft Kin handsets .. After years of playing it safe in the mobile space, Microsoft is charging forward in 2010. Its Windows Phone 7 update is a logical step for the world's biggest computer company, but today's launch of the Kin One and Kin Two are a little more left of field. These are phones with limited functionality aimed at a very specific audience, but they hold a few new tricks that could make them a great, big hit with the kids.. The Kin Two bests its little brother, the Kin One, across the board specs-wise. Its larger keyboard sits under a longer screen, making it better for two-handed typing in a landscape mode. It also has 8GB of internal storage as opposed to the 4GB in the One. These differences aside, it seems like the One and Two are basically the same beast dressed in different outfits. They share the same connectivity specs and run on the same modified Windows Phone 7 platform.. One difference that could sway some shoppers, is the Two's 8-megapixel camera over the One's 5-megapixel shooter (are all these Ones and Twos making you snigger too?). If you watch through the introductory videos on the official Kin site you'll hear numerous mentions of the high-quality cameras in both phones, though we wonder if this actually means we can expect better than average camera phone photos from these beauties.. Microsoft isn't actually referring to the platform on these handsets as Kin OS, but this name seems as good as any to describe the system which, as mentioned above, reads like a watered-down version of Windows Phone 7 (WP7). Elements of WP7 design and the Zune OS inspire this truly funky-looking platform. But it's not all good looks, the Kin OS has some really cool features up its sleeve too.. There are three highlight features to refer to when talking about this system, Kin Spot, Kin Loop and Kin Studio. Beyond its role as mobile phone, Microsoft sees the Kins as social-networking hubs. The home screen of these phones is littered with recent social-networking updates from the accounts you connect to, this is the Kin Loop. People who want to share this information can drag and drop these items to the Kin Spot, like a clipboard on a Windows PC. Multiple items can be dragged to the Kin Spot at a time, including photos, videos, map references, website URLs, and then these items can be sent to one or numerous contacts via MMS or email.. Kin Studio is desktop PC software which lets you view all of your photos, contacts and SMS messages collected by your phone on a timeline view on the PC. Data from the phone is auto-synced with a server so that you don't have to come home at the end of each day and manually sync with a USB cable.. While the phones look nice, it's the software that has us buzzing, though after using the often-sluggish Motorola Dext and its Motoblur social-networking software, we have our reservations as well. Motoblur struggles when users have large-scale Twitter or Facebook accounts, and we're sincerely hoping this isn't also the case with the Kin. These integrated social-networking tools look fantastic, but the user experience needs to be seamless as well..
