Yes No. 1 out of 2 people found this review helpful. By Supriya Riya | 3 May 2016. After having octa core processor of 1.5 Ghz this phone runs very slow even it gets stop sometimes while working its only 3 months I have been using this phone and the phone is not working well. Yes it has good camera quality both front and back and good screen resolution but gets heat up while charging only after 5 minutes. So guys if you are reading this review I will never sugguest you to buy this phone its better you could go for samsung phones like A5 it has good speed, good camera, good screen resolution, and good storage as well if you would like to and if it fits in your pocket. Was this review helpful? Yes No. By Fayiz Ferosh | 23 Dec 2017. This set is very damn slow that all other HTC phones are faster than this set. Also the system apps occupies too much space that in 16GB set only 10GB is only available. Also if we think of rooting device to boost speed also it's of no use. For me I have just started using it. Only been almost one year of use. Also if you think of flashing with a new ROM guys I promise you that for this set, there is not even a single ROM available for this set. I strongly recommend not to buy this set.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. htc desire 828 otg support or not. By Anudeepu Surya | 20 Aug 2016. htc desire 828 otg support or not.

Network bands in regions may be different, depending on the mobile operator and your location. 4G LTE only available in select countries. Upload and download speeds also depend on the mobile provider.. Available storage is less due to phone software. Approximately 22.06 GB storage available for user content. Available storage is subject to change based on phone software updates and apps usage.. Battery times (talk time, standby time and more) are subject to network and phone usage. A Standby time specification ("specification") is an industry standard that is only intended to allow comparison of different mobile devices under the same circumstances. Power consumption in a standby state is strongly dependent on factors including but not limited to network, settings, location, movement, signal strength and mobile traffic. Comparisons of different mobile devices using such a specification can therefore only be done in a controlled laboratory environment. When using any mobile device in real life circumstances for which the mobile device is intended, the standby time could be considerably lower and will be strongly dependent on the factors mentioned above.. Note: Specifications are subject to change without prior notice..

BASED ON 807 RATING(S). 31 Dec 2015 By Riju Jacob Rajan On flipkart.com. I've been having an HTC from 2008 - yes still running fine.nThe new phone on the contrary was defective out of the box, so its fair to say they don't make them as they used to. One of the dual front speakers were not working (a whining sound was coming from it during sound playback)nnThe Flipkart's method of verifying if you return request is genuine has a lot to be desired.nThe so called "product specialist team" has neither the expertise nor the skills to asses the issue at hand.nnI was asked to install some 3rd party app and after the remote 'troubleshooting' by the "specialist" I was told my phone is fine. The "specialist" was sure the phone had only one front speaker in spite of me saying it had 2. Finally the "specialist" got enlightened accepted there are indeed 2 speakers I was asked to choose between replace or refund.nI opted for a refund. It was promptly picked-up.nnThe interaction with the "specialist" was truly a harrowing experience.nEverything else was ok.. 25 Dec 2015 By Satyajeet Kushwaha On flipkart.com. If you are looking for smart phone between 18-20k. This is beast of all.nLook is very classy in pearl white.nPhone is very slim and light weighted.nThe display is vibrant. Plays all videos with full color flow without lag.nThe sound is the quality feature, boosted with Dolby and dual speaker on front gives it extra power and also the voice is very clear.nThe gaming capacity of phone is also up to mark. I didnt play any heave games though but its very good for normal games.nThe phone is boosted with 2 gb ram and dosent lags at any point, It didnt hanged for a single instance.nCamera is best, front camera is 4 but believe me it gives so clear pic that looks decent much more than that.nIf you are HTC lover go for it..

Pros: Brand name, good in process since it has 3gb RAM, front camera quality is nice. Cons: I am using this phone more than a year but still using the outdated Android version. The OS can be upgraded to the higher version, but HTC has releasing the upgrades only for the higher end smart phones & not for the mid range phones. 1 amps charger took very long time to charge the battery (more than 3 hrs to charge 100% from 5%). Phone heats alot while using the 4G data. Always is shows my current location wrongly. If I am in Bangalore or Chennai the GPS location shows that I am in Goa or some where in Maharashtra.

HTC Desire 828 Review: The Desire 828 smartphone does nothing out of the ordinary, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.. HTC Desire 828 Dual SIM Rating. The Desire 828 has a good display and the front facing speakers add to the multimedia experience. But when you consider the competition at the sub 20K price point, you may want to access your requirement before choosing the right smartphone. This price point is flooded with smartphones offering a unique experience based on your requirement.. PROS Good display Good sound output Comfortable build Sense UI is one of the better skins overlaying Android. CONS Average camera Power button and volume rocker feel hidden in the side bezel 16GB built-in storage.

HTC Desire 828 Dual SIM is currently available at the best price of: ₹9,185. I must admit there was a time I would look forward to the phones that HTC would launch. I am talking about the era when the first HTC Desire was launched back in 2010. The HTC Desire was my first Android phone and I was in love with it. The Desire was actually the Nexus smartphone that HTC made for Google but with HTC’s Sense UI overlaying it and with an improved track pad (yes, smartphones once upon a time had track pads). Personally, after that smartphone I moved on to a Nexus. I still reviewed HTC’s smartphones at the time and for the era, they were “quietly brilliant”. After the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S2 HTC went on to becoming quietly ignored. But the smartphone maker persisted and launched phone after phone and despite doing some things brilliantly (boom sound), the smartphones never really excited many. I failed to understand why as there are a few gems hidden beneath all the marketing hype (UltraPixel jargon), something only an HTC fanboy would understand. (if any of those are still out there).. Today we review the HTC Desire 828. The smartphone is simple, elegant and competing in a price point dominated by the Chinese invasion. Does it have what it takes to stand out?. The build of the HTC Desire 828 is similar to its predecessors. The review unit we received has a black matte finished back and a golden brown border that surrounds the phone. The rear back panel is non removable but if you try really hard, you can get it off. The phone is really slim at 7.9mm and is very comfortable to hold. The matte rubberised back of the smartphone gives it a really good grip, better than some phones with a metal body. Considering the design on offer with the HTC Desire 828 it was extremely comfortable to hold especially when using the keyboard to type.. Coming back to the design, you have the standard port placement – MicroUSB port at the bottom, headphones jack on the top, SIM card slots on the left and the power button and volume rocker on the right. Moving to the power button and the volume rocker, they aren’t textured or protruding. From a design standpoint this is very good. From a functional standpoint, it isn’t easy to locate. It takes some getting used to and there is a leaning curve to remembering its position. Maybe I’m getting old but I prefer the textured power button. Its easier to identify without looking.. The front of the smartphone is clean and simple with HTC traditional Boomsound speakers at the top and the bottom of the display.. The smartphone doesn’t house a fingerprint sensor, which can be a bummer especially if you are one that has used a smartphone with a finger print sensor in this price bracket. A fingerprint sensor does make it easy for you to unlock your smartphone if nothing else and using it is like getting used to an elevator with automatic doors. Its just convenient and you really don’t like the manual door elevators even though they require nothing more than a slight effort.. Overall the build and design of the phone is quite good. It has a 5.5-inch form factor and even though that isn’t much of a difference when compared to the 6-inch behemoths floating around, it feels compact in one's hands.. Kicking things off with the display, the smartphone has a 5.5-inch LCD display with a 1920x1080 pixel resolution. The display is crisp, vibrant and placed along side other smartphone displays in the same price bracket, has better colour reproduction. Text looks good, whites look white and it’s a treat watching videos. I spent a lot of time watching animated movies and the colour reproduction was good and the display is vibrant.. Coming to the UI, if you have used an HTC smartphone in the past, you will feel right at home here. The smartphone runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop, skinned with the HTC Sense 7.0 UI. Sense UI 7.0 has a few tweaks when compared to its predecessor. It still has BlinkFeed with a few tweaks here and there but overall, the sense UI 7.0 is a good one.. Overall, the display of the smartphone is one of its biggest highlights and the UI is functional, which is what’s important.. Before we get into the performance of the smartphone here is a quick look at the specifications. As we’ve mentioned, the HTC Desire 828 has a 5.5-inch 1080p display. Under the hood, the smartphone has the Mediatek MT6753 chipset with the Octa-core 1.5GHz CPU. The device has 2GB RAM and 16GB built-in storage which can be expanded up to 200GB via a microSD card. The rear has a 13MP OIS camera and the front has a 4MP UltraPixel camera. A 2800mAh battery powers the entire package.. Here is a look at how the HTC Desire 828 competes with the OnePlus X, Lenovo Vibe P1, Meizu MX5 and Moto X Play in the benchmark comparison.. HTC Desire 828 performance scores Create bar charts. It isn’t a surprise, but the HTC Desire 828 isn’t the best performer but it isn’t the worst either. Moving on to the real world performance the Desire 828 has the ability to hold its own. Multitasking is a breeze and the device ran all the popular apps and games we threw at it. Sure, it isn’t a powerhouse but for multimedia consumption it is a great device.. Moving on to call quality, it’s surprisingly good. The audio is well audible at both ends and unless I faced a call drop issue, the experience of using the 828 as a phone was good.. Coming to the battery life, the smartphone survived for 7 hours and 50 minutes in the GeekBench Battery test and that’s about expected when compared to the competition. Moving to real world performance, the device lasts through the day with above average use including, calls, messaging, social media, light gaming the device was at about 20% by nightfall.. Moving to the camera, the HTC Desire 828 has a 13MP rear camera. Getting the worst out of the way, the camera has difficulty focusing when the object is very close. This is the case with a lot of cameras on smartphones in this price bracket.. Low light images taken from the camera of the HTC Desire 828. are soft and have a lot of noise. Colours are dim in low lit conditions but true to source. In well lit situations the colours reproduction is good. In the normal camera mode, getting the right focus point to get depth perception might be an issue but the camera does have a Bokeh mode to help with creating the effect of depth perception.. The competition for the best smartphone under Rs. You have great performers like the Asus Zenfone 2 , Moto X Play , Lenovo Vibe S1 and Meizu MX 5 gunning for that position. The HTC Desire 828 falls somewhere in the middle. It isn’t a powerhouse like the Zenfone 2, that has 4GB RAM, but the Desire 828 is a smooth performer nonetheless. It doesn’t have a fancy curved glass back like the Lenovo Vibe S1, but the matte rubberised finish gives the device a good grip. It has no fingerprint sensor but we really aren’t complaining about that. It doesn’t have the Marathon M5’s battery but it can last a day. What it does have going for it is a great display and some good sound. Overall this is your run of the mill sturdy and trustworthy smartphone with a comfortable form factor, good sound and display and an average camera.

HTC One A9 and HTC Desire 828 Dual SIM First Impressions. Ketan Pratap , 26 November 2015. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Ever since HTC unveiled its One A9 smartphone back in October in New York, the smartphone has been in news thanks to its similarity to the iPhone 6. Following several reports calling the One A9's design 'heavily' inspired by the iPhone , the Taiwanese company got defensive, refuting the claims and even suggested that Apple had copied HTC and not vice-versa .. The phone has only been available in a limited number of markets till now. HTC on Wednesday announced the HTC One A9 in India alongside the Desire 828 Dual SIM. The company confirmed that both phones will start shipping to India in the next two weeks, and has chosen to withhold pricing information until then. The company stated that pricing will be announced closer to the date of availability. In line with what the company's Chairwoman and CEO Cher Wang has previously said, the company stressed that the One A9 will be a 'good alternative to the iPhone.' The HTC One A9 boasts of a metal unibody design as well as impressive innards.. As for the new HTC Desire 828 Dual SIM, the company touts that it's the first model in the Desire range that comes with OIS (optical image stabilisation). We spent some time with both the new One A9 and Desire 828 Dual SIM at the launch event and here are our first impressions.. HTC has been using unibody designs since the original One (later known as the One M7) was launched in 2013. This signature design language started feeling repetitive with its flagship launches in the following years, the HTC One (M8) in 2014 and this year's One M9 , both looking very similar. The HTC One A9 however is a much-needed break. The unibody design now features a thin profile and edge-to-edge 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass.. When we first held the HTC One A9, we were impressed with its build quality as well as the design. It easily fit in our hands despite featuring a 5-inch screen. It's a new look for HTC but there's no denying the similarities to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. The front looks slightly different from Apple's design thanks to the oblong fingerprint scanner on the One A9. The rear is where the handset most resembles the iPhones, especially because of the antenna bands. The smartphone will be available in Carbon Grey, Opal Silver, Topaz Gold, and Deep Garnet colours. We played with a Deep Garnet unit. HTC at the launch event stressed that the One A9's body is constructed with jewellery-grade precision, referring to the bead-blasting and polishing processes that give it its finish.. The handset features on-screen Back, Home, and Recents buttons. The fingerprint scanner can be used for unlocking the handset. In the limited time we had with the device, we tried using the fingerprint scanner and it worked well, responding to touch and unlocking the phone promptly. The One A9's volume rocker and power button are on the right, while the SIM and microSD card slots are on the left. The bottom has the speaker grille, charging port and 3.5mm audio jack.. In terms of specifications, the One A9 is powered by a 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 processor with four cores clocked at 1.5GHz and four cores at 1.2GHz. The phone packs in 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and supports microSD cards of up to 2TB. The 5-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) display is complemented by a 13-megapixel rear camera with sapphire cover lens, f/2.0 aperture, autofocus, BSI sensor, OIS (optical image stabilisation), support for 1080p video recording, and an LED flash module. There is also a 4-UltraPixel front-facing fixed-focus camera. The handset is powered by a 2150mAh battery.. The full-HD Amoled display on the One A9 looked bright and colour reproduction was satisfactory. The viewing angles on the smartphone were also good, and visibility under direct artificial lights was impressive. The company at the launch revealed that it has tweaked the handset for directly sunlight visibility and expects it to perform well in such conditions. During our limited time spent with the One A9, we found that it was responsive to touch inputs and was quick with multitasking.. The 13-megapixel rear camera on the One A9 took some crisp images under the controlled indoor light conditions. We hope that the OIS feature will help this handset compete against other high-end Android handsets. The camera bulges out slightly, like it does on many other smartphones. The front UltraPixel camera also managed to capture some decent selfies. Some of the modes in the camera app include Slow Motion, Hyperlapse, Pro, Panorama, and Selfie. Stay tuned for our detailed review when we will really get a chance to test the camera under varied conditions.. Another notable feature of the One A9 is that it runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow with the company's Sense UI on top. HTC India touted that the One A9 is the first handset to launch with Marshmallow running out-of-the-box and the first non-nexus handset. The UI looks refreshing and seems to be an upgrade over what we've seen on the One M9+ in our review. The new UI brings some neat touches including more customisation options. A Themes app comes preloaded on the One A9. One of the company's representatives told us at the launch that HTC now has more than 25,000 themes and sees good number of downloads from users, though it isn't sharing exact download numbers. HTC's BlinkFeed is still part of Sense UI, but due to connectivity issues at the launch event, we were unable to see what has changed in the latest version.. On the other hand, the HTC Desire 828 Dual SIM strictly follows the established Desire series design, which means lots of polycarbonate. The device will require two hands to operate due to the 5.5-inch screen. Much like the One A9, the Desire 828 Dual SIM also features on-screen Back, Home, and Recents buttons. The right panel holds the volume rocker and power buttons while the left has slots for the two SIMs as well as a microSD card. The Desire 828 Dual SIM features BoomSound stereo speakers, which are complemented by Dolby audio enhancement.. The handset, unlike the One A9, runs Android 5.1 Lollipop with Sense 7. It features a 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) IPS display; a 13-megapixel rear camera with LED flash, OIS, and BSI sensor; an UltraPixel front camera with a BSI sensor; dual-SIM (dual-4G); an octa-core MediaTek MT6753 SoC clocked at 1.5GHz; 2GB of RAM; 16GB of inbuilt storage; support for microSD cards of up to 2TB; and a 2800mAh battery.. The full-HD display looked impressive and colour reproduction was decent. Visibility under direct artificial lights however was below par. Visibility under natural light might be a problem for Desire 828 Dual SIM, but we would wait until we spend more time with the device as part of our detailed review process before judging that. The ohone responded to our touch inputs with ease and even handled constant switches between the camera app and other apps without any noticeable slowdowns. The rear camera took some satisfactory shots in good lighting. The front camera however did only an average job with the selfies, which lacked details and looked slightly hazy.. The HTC One A9 was initially launched at $399.99 (approximately Rs. 26,000) unlocked, as a special offer price in the US. The company later revised the price to $499.99 (roughly Rs. 32,500) for unlocked units, hinting that we can expect the handset to be priced around the same price in India. If this turns out to be the case, HTC's new One A9 will compete against the LG Google Nexus 5X and Motorola Moto X Style - both currently available at around the same price. A company representative however pointed at the launch event that the current conversion rate might not allow the company to price the One A9 competitively.. We can expect the Desire 828 Dual SIM to be priced at roughly Rs. 15,000-20,000 considering that it was unveiled in China at CNY 1,599 (approximately Rs. One of the biggest competitors for the Desire 828 Dual SIM will be the Motorola Moto X Play .. Stay tuned for our detailed reviews of both the HTC Desire 828 Dual SIM and the HTC One A9..

HTC Desire 828 Price, Review and Specifications. HTC Desire 828 was introduced in India yesterday. Though we are still not sure about the price, this is supposed to be a lower mid-range phone, and thus its admirable that HTC has managed to fit in Optical Image Stabilization for the camera. Lowest price of HTC Desire 828 is still a mystery as there is no official confirmation on that front yet. The Desire series handset has a 5.5 Inch full HD display, with good viewing angles and brightness. The handset is powered by low cost MediaTek MT6753T silicon, with 8 Cortex A53 cores clocked 1.5 GHz, backed with 2GB RAM and 16GB expandable storage. The HTC Sense UI is based on Android 5.1 Lollipop. The 13MP rear camera has F2.0 aperture lens, while an Ultra-Pixel camera with wide angle lens is present on the front which has larger pixel size to capture more light and with it, HTC claims to solve eternal problem of poor-lit selfies. Other features include HTC boomsound speakers for loud and clear audio experience, 4G LTE, CDMA (800MHz) support, WiFi ac, GPS, GLONASS, Bluetooth 4.1 and 2800mAh battery. We will update more information on when you can buy HTC Desire 828 Online at lowest price in India soon after HTC reveals the price and availability information. Question: How is the display on HTC Desire 828?. Answer: HTC Desire 828 features an FHD IPS panel display with 401ppi. In real life, display shines indoors but lets you down outdoors under direct sun. Even on cent percent brightness, we had difficulty in reading emails and phone contacts, also because of its reflective nature. Counting out these two minor issues, HTC Desire 828 display will not disappoint you. Despite all those big spec numbers, we will say, this not the best display in this price bracket. Question: Does the display Include gorilla glass protection?. Answer: Yes, HTC has used Corning Glass 4 to prevent day to day scratches. Question: How’s the design and build?. Answer: HTC has tweaked its dual accent design with Desire 828. The phone has a slightly curved back which is made from matte finish plastic. Display nicely sits on a slightly raised platform with a plastic fame outlining it. On the sides, it is covered with a metallic finish plastic which feels solid and adds to the overall appeal of the phone. The only difficulty we had with its design in the volume rocker and power key. Both these keys are flat and will take some effort getting used to it. HTC’s dual signature dual speakers are neatly placed on both above and below the display. Question: Are the capacitive keys backlit?. Answer: The Desire 828 doesn’t feature any capacitive buttons, therefore backlit key are out of the Question. Question: What kind of SIM card does it accept?. Answers: The HTC Desire 828 is a dual SIM phone and it supports nano-SIM in both slots. Question: How much internal storage space is free? Can Apps be moved to SD card on HTC Desire 828?. Answer: Out of 16 GB of internal storage, around 9.4 GB is available at the user end. Yes, users can move some of the apps to SD card. Answer: Yes, It does support USB OTG. Question: How is the HTC Desire 828 performance?. Answer: In day-to-day life, HTC Desire 828 performance was on the expected line. In basic tasks like calling, texting, social media, listening music or browsing internet on the phone it handles everything perfectly. With regards to gaming performance, Desire 828 handled 2 out 3 high-end games we tested very well. Nova 3 and Dead Trigger 2 game play were buttery smooth while we witnessed some fame drops and lag while testing Asphalt 8. Question: What is SAR Value of HTC Desire 828?. Answer: SAR values are 0.320 W/kg@1 g at Head, 0.479 W/kg@1 g at body. Question: Does The Desire 828 have heating issues?. Answer: As of now we didn’t notice any heating issues in Desire 828. Question: How much RAM is free on first boot?. Answer: Out of 2 GB RAM, we got 850 Mb was free on the first boot. Question: How is the HTC Desire 828 camera?. Answer: The camera on HTC Desire 828 performs best in the outdoor conditions. Details and colors were close to nature in outdoor shots. In closed surroundings, we witnessed some grains in the images. Mid tones were well saturated in both indoor and outdoor shots. HTC laid much stress on the presence of optical image stabilization (OIS), and it works efficiently. The 4MP ultrapixel selfie camera also captures images exceedingly well. Selfies taken from it appears sharp with a good amount of details and well-saturated colors. The beatify on HTC Desire 828 is worth mentioning as it comes with a sliding option to manually pick the right balance to suit individual preference. Question: How is the call quality?. Answer: We didn’t witness any issues in call reception in our area. Question: How is the Battery backup on HTC Desire 828?. Answer: The 2800mAh offered us a decent screen on time. With HTC Desire 828 we were able to squeeze out 5-6 hours of screen on time. That is good enough for one day usage for basic and moderate users. Question: Is the battery removable on HTC Desire 828?. Answer: No, the HTC Desire 828 comes with a non-removable battery. Answer: The Desire 828 comes with Android 5.1 Lollipop HTC’s Sense 7 running on top of it. The HTC Sense UI offers lots of customization options, it gives users the liberty to choose and use themes, fonts and widgets as per their preference. Question: Does HTC Desire 828 support Gesture features?. Answer: Yes, HTC Desire 828 features Media Gestures and Motion Gestures. Question: How loud is the loudspeaker on HTC Desire 828?.

BASED ON 820 RATING(S). 31 Dec 2015 By Riju Jacob Rajan On flipkart.com. I've been having an HTC from 2008 - yes still running fine.nThe new phone on the contrary was defective out of the box, so its fair to say they don't make them as they used to. One of the dual front speakers were not working (a whining sound was coming from it during sound playback)nnThe Flipkart's method of verifying if you return request is genuine has a lot to be desired.nThe so called "product specialist team" has neither the expertise nor the skills to asses the issue at hand.nnI was asked to install some 3rd party app and after the remote 'troubleshooting' by the "specialist" I was told my phone is fine. The "specialist" was sure the phone had only one front speaker in spite of me saying it had 2. Finally the "specialist" got enlightened accepted there are indeed 2 speakers I was asked to choose between replace or refund.nI opted for a refund. It was promptly picked-up.nnThe interaction with the "specialist" was truly a harrowing experience.nEverything else was ok.. 25 Dec 2015 By Satyajeet Kushwaha On flipkart.com. If you are looking for smart phone between 18-20k. This is beast of all.nLook is very classy in pearl white.nPhone is very slim and light weighted.nThe display is vibrant. Plays all videos with full color flow without lag.nThe sound is the quality feature, boosted with Dolby and dual speaker on front gives it extra power and also the voice is very clear.nThe gaming capacity of phone is also up to mark. I didnt play any heave games though but its very good for normal games.nThe phone is boosted with 2 gb ram and dosent lags at any point, It didnt hanged for a single instance.nCamera is best, front camera is 4 but believe me it gives so clear pic that looks decent much more than that.nIf you are HTC lover go for it..
