The HTC Desire 10 Pro puts top specs like a 20-megapixel camera and hefty battery into an affordable phone. The scaled-back Desire 10 Lifestyle will cost you even less.. by September 20, 2016 12:00 AM PDT. Meet the HTC Desire 10 Pro and Desire 10 Lifestyle (pictures).

If "budget phone" conjures images of a clunky plastic handset with blah-blah specs, you'll want to chuck that notion now. HTC is on a mission to deliver flagship-level features in a phone that costs less than half of many of today's premium handsets.. HTC on Tuesday announced the midrange Desire 10 Pro, alongside the far more entry-level (and cheaper!) Desire 10 Lifestyle. For now, both phones will sell only in Europe, with the Desire 10 Pro arriving at the beginning of November. We don't know for how much, although the company confirmed it would be less than the flagship HTC 10 , which costs $699, £569 and AU$1,099. You'll be able to buy the Desire 10 Lifestyle at the end of September for £249, which converts to about $325 and AU$430.. Meet the HTC Desire 10 Pro and Desire 10 Lifestyle (pictures). The Pro is aimed at consumers who want high-end performance at a midrange price, while the Lifestyle is for those on a set budget.. The phones feature a matte plastic finish with a metal trim around the edges and the camera lens. It's not much of an accent, but it does help make both handsets flashier than previous Desire models, although they aren't nearly as elegant as the all-metal HTC 10.. One of the most interesting things about the Pro is the fingerprint sensor on the back, which marks a first for the Desire line. It's a signal of HTC getting serious with lower-price competitors coming from Huawei, Alcatel, OnePlus and Motorola.. Another is the camera, a 20-megapixel shooter with an f/2.2 aperture, dual-LED flash and laser autofocus. Meanwhile, a 13-megapixel camera sits up front, which can be used with HTC's new Selfie Panorama mode to capture a super-wide 150-degree shot.. The Pro is also a large-screen phone, equipped with a 5.5-inch full HD display and an octa-core MediaTek processor. It will be offered in two flavors: One with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage and the other with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.. Here are all the hardware specs:. HTC has tough competition in the affordable market. The Desire 10 Lifestyle will match up against both the Moto G4 and Moto G4 Plus , which are two of our favorite budget phones.. On paper, the Lifestyle appears to falls short. It lacks a fingerprint sensor and the 5.5-inch display has a lower-resolution (but cost-saving) 1,280x720-pixel screen.. It also has a low-end Snapdragon 400 processor, although it can be configured with up to 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, which should provide better performance from from the 2GB/16GB base model.. One thing the Lifestyle does have over both the Moto G4 and Desire 10 Pro is support for 24-bit Hi-Res audio. This is the same technology featured in the flagship HTC 10, and it should improve audio quality when listening to music over the speakers and through headphones .. The full specs are listed below:.

What is a hands on review?. HTC looks to have a promising handset on its hands. There's loads of great tech packed into the surprisingly premium polycarbonate body, and as long as the price is kept reasonable it's a phone worth getting excited about.. Release date and price Design and display What's it like to use? Camera Battery Verdict. HTC's duo of new mid-range smartphones aim to bring some flagship style to the middle of the market, and it's the HTC Desire 10 Pro leading the way as the most powerful Desire handset ever, borrowing several features from the HTC 10 .. While its cheaper brother, the Desire 10 Lifestyle, is firmly focused on audio, the Desire 10 Pro is a more well-rounded device, with a punchy octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor, 3GB/4GB of RAM, 32GB/64GB of internal storage, a microSD slot, a fingerprint sensor and the same 20MP rear camera as HTC's 2015 flagship, the HTC One M9 .. Those are solid foundations on which to build, and with an appealing design too the Desire 10 Pro could well make waves – but that depends to a large degree on the price, which is currently unknown.. The HTC Desire 10 Pro will be available to order from November – which means you've got some time to work out if it's a phone you may want – but we've been told it won't be coming to the UK.. As for how much the Desire 10 Pro will set you back, we're still waiting to hear final confirmation from HTC, and this will dictate the potential success of the handset.. What we do know is that the Pro will be more expensive than the Desire 10 Lifestyle – which may mean the Pro could be costlier than we'd like, as the Lifestyle is also marketed in the mid-range.. If the Taiwanese firm can keep the price down to the levels of the OnePlus 3 then the Desire 10 Pro will be an attractive, disruptive presence in the market – but any higher and it could struggle against a number of cheaper, but just as feature-packed, rivals.. The HTC Desire 10 Pro hasn't inherited the premium metal unibody design of the HTC 10, and we feel like we need to get that out of the way ASAP – but not because it's necessarily a bad thing, as the Desire 10 Pro is still a good-looking phone.. At the heart of the 10 Pro is a metal frame, ensuring that it feels sturdy in the hand, but the main body material is soft-touch polycarbonate, which delivers a pleasing level of grip and comfort.. Measuring 156.5 x 76 x 7.86mm, the Desire 10 Pro isn't as tall or as wide as some handsets sporting a 5.5-inch display, but it's still a noticeable presence in the palm, and requires two-handed operation for some tasks. It's not overly heavy though, tipping the scales at 165g.. The phone is available in four colors: Stone Black, Royal Blue (dark blue), Valentine Lux (light blue) and Polar White, with all four options sporting gold trim for a more premium finish – although on the lighter hues this looks a little excessive.. On the back, below the sizable camera sensor, you'll find a fingerprint scanner that provides a secure, easy way to unlock your handset – although we don't like the fact that it can't be reached when the device is lying screen-side-up on our desk.. Still, this is the first time HTC has put a digit reader on a Desire phone, so the fact that it's there at all is a good thing.. And for all those audio fans out there still reeling from the news that Apple has removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus , the good news is that HTC has kept it for the Desire 10 Pro.. The company has even applied its BoomSound enhancement technology to the jack, giving you better audio when listening via headphones, although you won't get those enhancements when using the internal speakers – for that you'll need the Pro's sibling, the HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle.. The HTC Desire 10 Pro features a 5.5-inch 1080p display, which is bright and clear – ensuring videos and games look great. Colors aren't quite as vibrant as we've seen on Samsung's Super AMOLED panels, but you're unlikely to have any issues day-to-day.. HTC has packed plenty of power into the Desire 10 Pro, with an octa-core chip at its heart capably supported by either 3GB or 4GB of RAM, depending on whether you opt for the 32GB or 64GB model.. It's unlikely that you'll see both models available in your market, but don't be downhearted if you 'only' get the 3GB/32GB variant, as it will still pack a punch. There's a microSD slot too, allowing you to build on the internal space with cards up to 2TB in size.. Even the lower-spec version of the Desire 10 Pro should be able to handle the latest games and applications from the Play Store, while Google's Android Marshmallow operating system runs smoothly.. The Desire 10 Pro features the same Sense interface overlay as the HTC 10, allowing you to customize your home screens with various themes and stickers for a truly personal touch.. The Desire 10 Pro has the best camera HTC has ever put on a Desire handset – to be precise, it's got the same camera as the HTC One M9.. That means you're looking at a 20MP snapper with an f/2.2 aperture, HDR and two-tone flash. In one respect the 10 Pro even betters the M9's camera, as it adds laser autofocus. This should translate into bright, clear and in-focus shots, and strong performance in low light – although the camera is unlikely to match the snapper on the HTC 10.. During our brief hands-on time with the Desire 10 Pro the camera was quick, and results serviceable – although the device we were using wasn't running final software, so we can expect some fine-tuning between now and when the phone launches in October.. HTC has also redesigned its Pro Mode on the camera – an upgrade not even the HTC 10 has at the moment – with a trio of default settings including Macro and Sports, helping you tweak the various settings in an easier to understand way.. This is great for those still trying to get their heads around white balance, shutter speed and exposure values.. Around the front there's a 13MP camera, which boasts an HDR mode and a selfie panorama mode, allowing you to get even more buddies into your shots – that's a far higher megapixel count than the front snapper on the 5MP HTC 10.. The HTC Desire 10 Pro comes with a 3000mAh non-removable battery, which HTC claims will give you up to eight hours of internet use over Wi-Fi, 11 hours of HD video playback, or up to 53 hours of audio playback.. We fully expect the Desire 10 Pro to last a full day in general usage then, and there's fast charging for when it runs low – but you'll have to wait for our in-depth review to find out for sure if the battery can go the distance.. HTC's Desire range has been a little wayward in the past couple of years, but with the Desire 10 Pro the firm looks to have a promising mid-range phone on its hands.. There's loads of great tech packed into the surprisingly premium polycarbonate body, and as long as HTC can keep the price of the Desire 10 Pro reasonable it's a phone we're really excited about fully reviewing.. What is a hands on review?. 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.

SpaceX’s biggest rival has a ‘genius’ plan to cut its rocket launch costs more than 70%. Tech Insider HTC’s n.... HTC’s newest phones are gorgeous and affordable, but they have one big catch. Jeff Dunn , Business Insider US. Both Desire 10 phones look good. ‘Mature’ seems to be the appropriate word here — they’re made from a mix of metal and matte plastic, with few flourishes over the finish. Before you say it, yes, there’s a definite Apple influence here. They also come in a variety of colors: black, white, navy blue, and the light blue pictured below. HTC calls this shade ‘Valentine Lux,’ so I’m just going to leave that there. Despite the similar names and builds, though, the two phones are generally pretty different. The Desire 10 Pro is the higher-end model of the two. It packs a 5.5-inch 1080p display, along with an octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor, 3 GB or 4 GB of RAM, 32 GB or 64 GB of expandable storage, and a 3,000 milliampere-hour battery. The Desire 10 Lifestyle, meanwhile, has a 5.5-inch 720p display — meaning it’s not as sharp — and uses a Snapdragon 400 chip, 2 GB or 3 GB of RAM, 16 GB or 32 GB of expandable storage, and a 2,700 milliampere-hour battery. The Pro also has stronger cameras: a 20-megapixel lens on the back and a 13-megapixel one on the front. That’s compared with the 13- and 5-megapixel shooters on the Desire 10 Lifestyle. The Lifestyle does have one advantage, though, in that it can play higher-res, 24-bit audio files. If you go out of your way for those — and if you have the headphones to hear it — those should sound sharper than your usual streaming-service fare. Both phones run on Android 6.0 to start, underneath HTC’s Sense UI skin. That generally doesn’t mess with Google’s take on Android, which is a good thing. The Desire 10 Lifestyle is available now in the UK and other European markets for £249 and up. HTC says the Desire 10 Pro will be available at some point in November, but hasn’t given any price point yet. Don’t expect either to arrive in the US right away. Assuming the Pro will cost more than the Lifestyle, both devices might be a difficult sell. They certainly look great, but Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 400 was a budget-level chip when it was announced years ago, and the Helio P10 generally can’t match some of the higher-range Snapdragons it might be competing against. In other words, these things might be underpowered for what you’re paying. With more and more midrange phones providing beefy performance, HTC is relying heavily on you wanting that design. After five straight quarters without posting a profit, it’s safe to say HTC isn’t thriving.. Particularly with phones – the company’s longtime bread and butter – it has watched Apple and Samsung retain their vise grip on the premium side of the market, and its own HTC 10 has struggled to gain any sort of traction.. On Tuesday, though, the Taiwanese manufacturer released its latest stab at winning over the midrange crowd, at least in Europe: the Desire 10 Pro and the Desire 10 Lifestyle.. While the two devices aim to offer higher-end designs at fairly affordable prices, a glance at their spec sheets seems to suggest some compromises. Curiously, both devices also use micro-USB connections instead of the newer and faster USB-C.. We’ve talked before about some of those new midrange values ..

HTC Desire 10 Pro, Desire 10 Lifestyle Won't Be Available In The US. 26 September 2016, 1:53 am EDT By Chris Loterina Tech Times. The new HTC Desire 10 lineup has already been launched, and it will begin shipping in early November. consumers will not be able to get their hands on either of the announced mid-range devices, as HTC says they will not be coming to the United States at all.. The line, which includes the Desire 10 Lifestyle and Desire 10 Pro, has generated significant buzz since their unveiling. several days ago because of its price. Initial hands-on experience has revealed that it is a great bang for the buck, sporting high-end hardware specifications, pleasing design language but with a remarkably low price point.. Consider, for example, how the HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle will retail for only $325 while HTC's flagship HTC 10 is being sold for $699. Pricing for the Pro variant has not been disclosed so far. However, despite the expectation that it will come at a steeper price point, the price tag could still be lower than HTC's flagship.. HTC has not been clear about its decision. Reports only cite an official position that touts a global focus in selling the device. Aside from the United States, Canada is also. Of course, HTC did not say that its decision is written in stone. This means both or either of the Lifestyle and Pro versions could still be available. This has been demonstrated, for example, in similar case involving HTC Desire 530, which was eventually released. Out of the two devices, the Pro version appears to be the more interesting. It has a better camera, which is capable of taking 20 megapixel shots. It also has a fingerprint scanner and a MediaTek Helio P10 CPU. There are reportedly two versions to the Pro: 3 GB and 4 GB models. A non-removable 3,000 mAh battery will also guarantee longer usage.. The Lifestyle version comes with a middling Snapdragon 400 chipset. Two variants are also available based on the 2 GB and 3 GB RAM specification. The device will also have 1,280 x 720p resolution. On paper, that figure seem deficient, especially given the fact that it has a 5.5-inch display. While the Pro has the same display size, it has a full HD screen, capable of 1,920 x 1,080p resolutions.. The Lifestyle also has 2,700 mAh battery, which should do just fine given the phone's low display resolution.. One particular aspect that the HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle excels in is its excellent audio quality. The technology in the device is said to match the one found in HTC 10..

HTC Desire 10 Pro is by all mean a very elegant and high profile premium phone.

Roydon Cerejo , 02 February 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The phone is powered by a Helio P10 SoC, with 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage. App and camera performance is good but some features are missing. The HTC Desire 10 Pro is priced at Rs. HTC Desire 10 Pro design HTC Desire 10 Pro specifications HTC Desire 10 Pro performance. The Desire 10 Pro is HTC’s latest mid-range smartphone, focusing mainly on design and camera quality. The company launched this phone back in November of last year, but it only went on sale in December.. 26,490, the Desire 10 Pro goes up against the likes of the Moto Z Play ( Review ), Asus ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) ( Review ) and OnePlus 3 and 3T. All of these are excellent smartphones in our book, which means the Desire 10 Pro needs to have more than just a fancy design for it to be worth recommending. Let's see if can deliver the goods.. HTC has been at the top of its game in recent times when it comes to build quality, and that shows here as well. The Desire 10 Pro has a metal body, which feels great when you hold it, also offers a good amount of grip. There are gold accents running along the edges, camera bump and back that give this phone a very striking look. The ‘Stone Black’ colour option that we received features a rubberised texture for the back, which certainly helps with grip, but also easily attracts scuff marks, some of which refuse to go away. We’re unsure if the other colour trims also have this issue, but if you have your eyes set on the black version then you might want to use a case.. HTC has fitted the Desire 10 Pro with a quality display. The 5.5-inch IPS panel produces good levels of brightness with good colours and contrast. The full-HD resolution ensures a decently high pixel count so there’s no visible pixellation of icons and text. There’s Gorilla Glass for added protection too. The display is tuned for a neutral tone by default but you can adjust the colour temperature in the Settings app if needed. The space above the display is a bit taller than the portion below, which makes the phone a bit longer than it should be. The capacitive buttons on the chin of the phone are backlit and responsive.. The power and volume buttons are on the right and have good tactile feedback. The power button also gets some ridges so it’s easily identifiable. On the left of the HTC Desire 10 Pro, you have the hybrid SIM slot that can accommodate two Nano-SIM cards or a Nano-SIM and a microSD card (up to 2TB) to expand the phone's storage. There’s a headphones socket on the top, and a Micro-USB port and speaker grille on the bottom The Desire 10 Pro has a visible camera bump around the back, followed by the LED flash and laser autofocus window just below it. There's also a fingerprint sensor around the back, which is quick at authentication and can double up as a button for snapping a selfie. We’re a little disappointed at the absence of a USB Type-C port here. Another disappointment is the lack of stereo speakers, so HTC's BoomSound enhancement only works with headphones.. The Desire 10 Pro ships with a 10W adapter, data cable, and headset. The quality of the bundled accessories is fairly good. Overall, the phone makes a very good first impression thanks to its unique design and superb build quality except for the fact that some of the scuffs and abrasions on the back which result from everyday use are impossible to clean.. Under the hood, the HTC Desire 10 Pro packs an octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 SoC, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. These core specifications look solid, and for all intents and purposes, they get the job done. However, when comparing performance in benchmarks to that of other phones in this price band, the Desire 10 Pro doesn't fare very well. The Helio P10 SoC is weaker than a Snapdragon 625, which is evident from the Desire 10 Pro's AnTuTu score of 55,187 and 3DMark Ice Storm unlimited score of 11,163. The Mali T-860 falls a bit short on performance in gaming benchmarks with a score of 18fps in GFXbench, versus an average of 28fps for phones using the Qualcomm chip.. Other specifications of the HTC Desire 10 Pro include Bluetooth 4.2, dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n, FM radio, USB-OTG, and GPS. NFC and Wi-Fi are notably absent. The phone packs in the usual suite of sensors including a gyroscope. 4G with VoLTE is supported on both SIM slots.. The Desire 10 Pro runs a lean version of HTC Sense on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow, just like the HTC 10 ( Review ). To avoid duplication of apps that serve the same purposes, HTC has used Google’s apps wherever possible, like Photos for the gallery and Play Music for the music player. The dialler and contacts apps have been cleaned up a bit, and there are some native HTC apps like Weather, Flashlight, and Boost+. The latter lets you manage permissions, clean junk files, and lock apps with the fingerprint scanner.. Some third-party apps are pre-installed, such as News Republic, Hungama, Under Armor Record, Facebook, and Instagram. There’s also a Themes app for changing the look of the UI.. The Desire 10 Pro takes a hit in benchmarks but in the real world, it does alright. Average RAM usage is generally about 2GB, leaving you with plenty to spare. We barely noticed any slowdowns or stutters during our usage either. One thing we really liked is the fact that this phone barely gets hot, even when performing stressful tasks like shooting videos or gaming. Heavy games like Asphalt 8 run just fine too. The phone is also slim and fairly light, so it’s easy to live with.. The mono speaker on the HTC Desire 10 Pro does a good job with alerts, and sound is loud and distinct. The experience is not the best with media files but then that’s expected. Audio through the bundled headphones is good, and gets better with BoomSound enabled.. The main camera on the HTC Desire 10 Pro has a 20-megapixel sensor with laser autofocus and an f/2.2 aperture lens. On the front, there’s a 13-megapixel sensor with the same f/2.2 aperture. Both cameras support Auto HDR mode and full-HD video recording.. Images captured with the rear camera exhibit good detail and colours. Objects in focus have good sharpness and we didn’t encounter much chromatic aberration either. We found the camera struggling a bit with close-up shots - at times, it would refuse to lock onto subjects, making it quite frustrating to shoot them. Low-light shots are also handled well with fair bit of detail preserved and not much colour noise. Once again, close-ups taken with the HTC Desire 10 Pro were a bit of a struggle to get right..

The camera app also has a ‘Pro’ mode with the ability to shoot in RAW and save the manual settings to three custom profiles, which is a nice addition. Other shooting modes on the HTC Desire 10 Pro include panorama and Zoe camera which captures short video clips. Video recording only goes up to 1080p and the quality is good. The front camera manages detailed selfies, and in low-light, the ‘Retina flash’ feature does come in handy. You can also take a selfie panorama if you’re with a group of friends.. The non-removable 3000mAh battery on the HTC Desire 10 Pro will last you through nearly an entire day of regular use. We were able to to a little more than a full day on a single charge. In our HD video loop battery test, we got a runtime of 10 hours and 50 minutes. The HTC Desire 10 Pro supports fast charging too, and the bundled adapter is rated at 10W.. Verdict The HTC Desire 10 Pro is a good device but at Rs. 26,470, its pricing is on the higher side, which makes us think twice before recommending it. The SoC is not the best when you consider other Android smartphones around this segment that pack faster ones, and this phone also misses out on some conveniences like a Type-C USB connector, NFC, and Wi-Fi 802.11ac.. This phone would be worth considering at around Rs. 20,000, and paying anything more is a big ask. The Moto Z Play and Asus ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) both offer better value for a bit less. On the other hand, if you want something more future-proof, you could spend a bit more and get the OnePlus 3 or OnePlus 3T, whichever fits your budget. However, if you've considered all the competition and still really like the Desire 10 Pro looks you can pick it up from HTC India’s online store.. HTC Desire 10 Pro in pictures.

HTC Desire Pro 10 is a decent phone at this price. Though the software is not very customizable. I found my earlier One Plus One's software was far more customizable but can't help as CynogenMod no longer exists. Anyway I downloaded apps of my choice to customize the phone to my requirements.. Processor is fast, I don't see any lags even when playing games. Battery is also very nice but not great. Both front and back cameras are good.. 03 Jun 2017 By Flipkart Customer On flipkart.com. This is the worst ever phone ever I have came across. Except battery there is nothing worth in this. Even budget phones like Lava, Karbbon are superior in performance.. 1) Phone volume very less. Even in peaceful atmosphere it is difficult to hear voice. Crowded place you can't hear it.. 2) Ringtone sound is too low. Again in crowded place you are certainly going to miss calls.. 3) Fingerprint scanner total failure on most of the time.. 4) Only useful in bright light.This phone is useful only if you are not going to make or receive calls, if you are not going to enjoy music or video on your phone. It is basically storage device with complimentary mobile functions added to it.. HTC U Ultra and Desire 10 Pro price dropped to Rs 52,990 and Rs 23,990 respectively. Apr 10 2017 By Akshay Kumar.

HTC rekindles your desire with these two new smartphones following in the footsteps of their flagship.. HTC is looking to revitalize its HTC 10 line after the poor reception to its flagship earlier this year. Last week we discussed HTC's new launch event on September 20, and HTC has unveiled the new devices – the HTC Desire 10 Pro and the Desire 10 Lifestyle.. The two aren't the flagship phones as HTC 10, and occupy a spot in the midrange. However, they share the same sleek design language as the HTC 10, with a matte finish with gold metallic trim around the frame and along the antenna lines. The results are very stunning, as you'd expect from the Desire line. What you won't get is an edge-to-edge curved glass display, which is what a lot of people were thinking from the #BeEdgier hashtag. It may feel like a morbid tease, but what makes these phones edgier isn't the screen, but the beautiful gold trim that runs along the edges. It's still a great touch and the phones look fantastic.. The Desire 10 Pro is the most powerful of the two, with a 5.5-inch Full HD 1080p IPS display and Corning Gorilla Glass. Underneath is a MediaTek Helio P10 chipset supported by 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, complete with microSD expansion. HTC also focused heavily on the camera, and we get a 20-megapixel main camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 27.8mm lens, laser autofocus and Dual LED flash. The front camera is 13-megapixel and has a 150-degree panorama mode. It has LTE Cat.6 with 300/50Mbps bandwidth, dual band 5Ghz/2.4Ghz WiFi a/b/g/n, and the usual Bluetooth v4.2, NFC, and AGPS. HTC has not quite eschewed the headphone jack, and you'll find it here along with a microUSB port. A fingerprint sensor is on the back, and the battery is 3,000mAh.. The HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle, on the other hand, has much the same look as the Desire 10 Pro but comes with a less impressive 5.5-inch HD 720p display. The processor is also weaker with a Snapdragon 400 and 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage and microSD. If you are looking for something even weaker there's also a 2GB/16GB configuration available. The camera is 13-megapixel with f/2.2 aperture and a 28mm lens, while the front camera is 5-megapixel and f/2.8 with a 33.7mm lens. LTE is Cat.4 with 150/50Mbps bandwidth. Other than that the phones are pretty much identical, although the Lifestyle doesn't have a fingerprint sensor.. Both phones will be available in Stone Black, Polar White, Royal Blue and Valentina Flux. Pricing is currently unavailable but you can expect the Lifestyle to go for a much more affordable price than the Pro.. Reviews of HTC Desire 10 Pro.

Enjoy taking great camera shots on HTC Desire 10 pro.in sri lanka only at dialcom Rs.32,900. HTC is using TouchPal as the onscreen keyboard for HTC Desire 10 pro. The latest addition to the lineup is the HTC Desire 10 Pro, a dual-sim phone with a 5.5 inch full HD display. We used the phone for over a week as the primary phone and here’s how the phone fared.. 5.5-inch Full HD IPS display | MediaTek Helio P10 octa-core processor| 4GB RAM+64GB storage (expandable upto 2TB)| 20MP rear camera with OIS, 13MP front camera | 3000 mAh battery with Fast Charge| Android 6.0.1 with HTC Sense |. HTC Desire 10 Pro full specs. The HTC Desire 10 Pro is a mid-range smartphone from from HTC, but pull the device out of the box and you realise that this could just as well be a flagship. The build quality is amazing, the soft matte finish feels extremely premium and the gold-metal lines running along the chamfered edges really makes the phone stand out from other devices in the market. The screen is layered with Gorilla Glass for some peace of mind, but we’d recommend a tempered glass screen anyway.. The HTC Desire 10 Pro comes loaded with Android Marshmallow layered with HTC’s own Sense UI. While we’re generally vary of customised flavours of Android, HTC has done some really good things with it. For starters, it takes customisation to a whole new level with HTC’s Freestyle Layout, which allows for a really unique visual layout. The OS also comes with HTC Themes if you’d like to keep things simple. Frankly, if you like to change things up every now and then, there’s practically limitless possibilities with the HTC Desire 10 Pro and you’re going to love it. The primary camera has a resolution of 20 megapixels on a BSI sensor. There’s optical image stabilization to ensure stable shots paired with a wide aperture of f/2.2. The stock camera app offers plenty of shooting modes along with a Professional mode. The primary camera performs good all round, partly thanks to the fact that it can shoot in RAW.. There’s laser assist for the phase detect auto-focus, which works well. It stutters a little in low light, but it isn’t poor by any means. The photos are a little over-saturated for our taste, but this is purely a personal preference and is something that can easily be fixed by either shooting RAW or just editing the photos to have a lower saturation level. The front camera offers a panoramic selfie mode, which helps when there’s a large crowd demanding to be photographed.. Last but not the least, the battery on the HTC Desire 10 Pro performs just as you’d expect. Over the course of using this phone as our primary device, we could easily squeeze out a whole day’s worth of use, having to charge it only at bedtime. To put things in perspective, a normal day starts at 10 in the morning and concludes by midnight.. During the odd day of excessive gaming and binge watching. (to drain the battery) we found that using the supplied charger allowed the phone’s battery to go from 0 to 100 per cent in a little over 90 minutes. More importantly, the phone charged up to 40 per cent in about 35 minutes. This is impressive, but normal for phones equipped with some form of fast charging or the other. Nonetheless, we’re glad HTC decided to include Fast Charging on the HTC Desire 10 Pro.. HTC Desire 10 Pro uses a Helio P10 octa core processor paired with 4GB of RAM. As a mid-range device priced at Rs 26,490, we feel that HTC could have used a beefier CPU, given that. both do so at similar (or lower) price point. While the P10 chip doesn’t result in any performance hiccups with regard to average day-to-day activities, you do see the phone struggle while gaming. Playing Asphalt 8 is mostly smooth, except when you’re in the game’s menu, which takes about half a second to respond after a tap or when you finish a race and the camera switches, resulting in very noticeable lag.. While the camera is overall good, there is one component that leaves room for significant improvement and that is the Professional mode. When taking photos using the Professional mode (with RAW capture enabled), there is a noticeable lag in the camera interface. Tapping on the screen to focus responds after a split second. However, what’s worse is that the shutter button also takes a little time to respond, resulting in an image which reflects a moment other than the one you had tried to shoot.. A lot of the times for us, while trying to take a photo of our dog, we’d tap the shutter button, but the photo would be taken a split second later, often resulting in subject movement. This behaviour did not occur while shooting JPG (or at least not as noticeably), so it would seem that the CPU is having a hard time managing the RAW data.. Well, if you’re looking for a phone that exudes the build and elegance of a flagship, then yes. If you need a high resolution camera (both on the front and back), then the HTC Desire 10 Pro is a really good option seeing how the competition in this price segment doesn’t offer anything similar. For the price, HTC offers an excellent Android experience, good cameras and good audio output along with battery life that meets expectations.. Dialcom © 1999 - All rights Reserved.
