An unlocked phone is a device that is not bound to any carrier or plan. It allows you to choose your phone first and your carrier second. Upon selecting a plan, simply insert the carrier's SIM card into the phone and you're ready to go. If you decide you want to change carriers down the road or want to take an international trip, it's as simple as replacing your existing SIM card with a new SIM and activating your new plan.. What are the benefits of an unlocked phone?. Freedom: Choose the carrier with the best service or price. If you find a better deal later, you have the ability to change to a different carrier.. Travel: Take your phone internationally and use the carrier of your choice. It's as easy as inserting an active SIM card.. Selection: Choose the phone with the features you want, whether or not your carrier sells it, and get more service options without a contract.. How do I set up my unlocked phone?. The first thing you’ll need is a SIM card for your desired carrier. When activated, the SIM card will let your phone connect to your carrier’s network. If you decide to upgrade to a newer unlocked phone in the future, you can easily remove the SIM card from your old phone and put it in your new phone—just make sure you get the right size of SIM card (nano, micro, or standard) for your phone. If you want to use your phone while traveling internationally, you can easily buy a SIM card for a carrier that operates where you’re traveling. As long as it’s activated, you can just swap SIM cards when you arrive at your destination.. 5 MP, 2592 х 1944 pixels, Geo-tagging, panorama, HDR, 480p@30fps. 5.11 x 2.62 x 2.08 in. 0.3 x 5.7 x 2.8 in. 2.78 x 3.23 x 5.57 in. 2.59 x 5.11 x 0.46 in. 2.55 x 4.91 x 0.48 in. 0.46 x 2.6 x 5.1 in.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent budget phone. Color: White | Offer Type: 4G LTE - 8GB | Verified Purchase. I got the Motorola Moto E LTE(2nd gen) 2015 model to replace my aging Samsung Galaxy S2. I had the S2 for quite a while now and never really thought about upgrading until files would sometimes become corrupted and undeleteable, wifi connection would be finicky half the time, sometimes my carrier wouldn't be detected or connectable to, call quality with the onboard mic/speaker was poor(Bluetooth headsets do not have this problem) but most irritating of all most apps would take 4-8 seconds to start up no matter what I did to optimize the android system. After seeing all the fancy models coming out I decided I needed an upgrade. I mainly chose the new 2015 Moto E due to press provided by reviews on YouTube and online. I was made aware of its pros and cons from the very start. I new it wasn't gonna be like these new flagships raging all over the news, but I didn't need it to be. I wanted a simple yet stable platform for simple tasks like youtube, we surfing, calls/texts and email. Something that started applications quickly, was stable and affordable. I just got the phone today and it came in a tiny box, much smaller than what I saw some of the reviewers received. It contained the phone, a QuickStart guide, a Motorola specs and warranty booklet and a micro usb charger. I just plugged in my sim and SD card, connected to my wifi network and then logged into my Google account. (IMPORTANT NOTE: it is not necessary to have a google account or use a wifi network. The phone will work just fine for calls with just the SIM card.) The interface and experience of the phone is WAAAAY better than my previous phone. Apps start up right away, navigating between app drawer and home screen is a lot faster, no more lag! I'm so happy. The feel of the phone is very solid, no rattles or creaks noted. The back has a nice matte finish. It weighs just as much as my Galaxy S2, which isn't a lot. I'll take some photos and post them here. The phones are equal length and width, but the Moto E is definitely thicker overall. The E despite its thicker body, feel better in the hand due to the gentle curvature of the edges. Thus allowing your fingers to better "wrap around" when reaching or swiping on the screen. Screen sizes are about the same with the Android buttons being onscreen on the Moto E vs on the bezel with the Galaxy. Looking closely, the screen of the MOTO E is a bit sharper, while the S2 has a slight blue tinge to it. This review feels a bit long winded and I hope it helps someone.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Budget Smartphone for GSM customers. Color: Black | Offer Type: 4G LTE - 8GB | Verified Purchase. Instead of writing a review giving specs, speeds, etc, which would repeat a lot of what people already said, I'll be more specific in case-use examples. Do NOT buy this phone if you: - Want to take excellent photos - Rely on a compass - Want a replaceable battery - Want a high resolution screen - Install a lot of apps - Play graphic intensive games - Want WiFi calling features - Need a flashlight in your phone - If you care about the thickness of your phone - If you use Apple products / iPhones - Use an adapter to mirror your phone's display onto a TV - Take selfies - Listen to music through the phone's speakers - Rely on a notification light DO buy this phone if you: - Need a cheap phone - Want a long lasting battery - Use MicroSD storage - Want a smaller form factor (in comparison to the large flagship phones) - Want close to pure Android with the latest updates - Play Emulators - Play Simple Games - Play Minecraft - Use your phone for Navigation - Want an FM radio in your phone - Use a bluetooth headset, or other bluetooth devices - Use a Chromecast (can mirror the screen to a Chromecast / Miracast device) - Want a 64bit processor - Make phone calls - Want a phone that feels nice in the hand - Need OTG capabilities (USB Drive Mounting, Keyboards/Mice) Maybe a phone for you if: - You want a nice reliable backup phone - Want something simple for a child, or someone who doesn't want to mess with a lot of smart phone features - Want a tinkering challenge. I highly suggest CM12.1, which gives you access to a few more software features, including a notification light!. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Wau. Color: White | Offer Type: 4G LTE - 8GB. I bought this straight from Motorola the day it was publicly announced, and I absolutely love this handset! While I was bummed about Youtube scaling back to 480p software wise, you can tell that the screen is actually pretty phenomenal for its class when streaming 1080p Netflix (the difference is very visible even on a qHD screen). As a daily driver, I actually prefer the Moto E 2nd Gen LTE to my ol' Nexus 5, because the battery lasts much longer, which helps the Moto E carry daily tasks out better. I *REALLY* love how the Moto E fits in my hand. To me it's definitely better feeling in the hand than an HTC One M7, especially when the M7 gets toasty. The Moto E tends to also stay relatively cool under stress, which I can't say for my One M7 and Nexus 5. But overall the Moto E feels a lot "friendlier" than any of the aforementioned phones, and I have a lot more peace of mind running around town or going out at night with this phone. It is by far my favorite phone to date, even when stacked against all the flagships I've owned. Pros: -way better build quality over 1st gen (the loose backplate and light leakage are absolutely gone) -4.5" a nice form factor, exceptionally nice to use with one hand, esp with Moto ergos -excellent real world battery life due to low res screen and big battery -quick and clean vanilla UI (should get even better with 5.1) -*excellent* LTE bands for America+Canada (all of the Americas from what I understand) - getting 40-50 mbps down / 25 mbps up in my area on T-Mobile unlt'd -Snapdragon 410 actually feels faster than 400 in real world usage -bloody brilliant customer service (instant call/chat button in built in "Help" app) -price, obviously. (u could go with a chinese manufacturer but i guarantee you will not receive the same top notch customer service, LTE bands, best in industry software updates, or overall thoughtful design.) -microSD capacity: load this bad boy up with a 64GB/128GB puppy and get cracked out on beats or whatever u do with ur offline storage Cons: -light sensor finicky in total darkness (also the case on my Moto G 2nd Gen) [edit: this was fixed in the 5.1 update] -no HDMI out, Chromecast not currently optimized for taking advantage of superb LTE connection -no LED flash/torch Overall, a very nice phone that punches well above its weight and truly does 90% of what flagships can do for an eighth of the cost. If you want a phone for decent multitasking for daily tasks, while you're on the move, look no further. I got used to the qHD res pretty fast and for most purposes it's way more than livable, thanks to decent colors, brightness, and viewing angles. If you want to consume lots of video.. until Google gets Chromecast working with a direct LTE connection, maybe go with a Nexus 6. For the money though, this is a way smarter iPhone 4S alternative. (Recommended especially for ABG's that end up getting smashed and smashing/losing their flagship phones. Srsly idk how y'all do that to $600 phones.

The MOTO E 2nd Generation is the best phone for its size. Battery life is OK, camera is the biggest complaint but still an excellent phone for smaller size preference.. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New. by darkstar89_6 Oct 21, 2017. This is one of the best android phones I’ve ever had. Although it’s small and has only 1gb Ram, this phone is powerful and perfectly stable, I got the dual sim version and I didn’t know that, and because of that I can’t upgrade it to android m, but for my own surprise it actually doesn’t need it, because lollipop works just as good as marshmallow on this phone, and it’s battery could compete with a good ol’ Nokia phone. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned. Streaming Bluetooth tunes literally 8 hours minimum per day, the rest is casual usage like playing games, texting,ect. Still only needs charged one time at night.. Only thingmissing is a flash, But for the stability and battery life it's worth the trade off for a 16 Yrs old.. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned. by wolwillisteve Jun 16, 2016. A snappy and quickly base android phone. Purchased for my son and he likes it. It was only slightly slower than my LG G3. It's smaller than the larger style new phones but I find it to be a perfect size and easy to hang onto. Not a bad value at all for such a little powerhouse. Only real compliant is no flash for photos but not a big issue for the price.. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New. It's faster and better and more sensitive than my Samsung S4 on for $68 I couldn't be happier I use it for work and my old phone just wouldn't pick up the signal so I kept missing orders this one picks up the orders right away so I made an extra $200 the first week.

Hello Rivero, do you mean the paper tab at the bottom of the phone when you first take it out of the box?. I don’t think this has an actual use for the phone.

Motorola’s second generation Moto E receives significant enhancements, including a faster 64-bit SoC, front-facing camera, and bigger battery. Is this budget smartphone worth more than its bargain price?. Flagships get all the glory and all the latest technology: blazing fast 64-bit octa-core processors; large, retina displays; wireless charging; high-resolution cameras with OIS and swift phase detection autofocus. While these premium phones may captivate our attention, not everyone needs their cutting-edge features or their extravagant prices. Fortunately, technology’s rapid pace of development has pushed once fanciful features into lower-cost phones.. Two years ago, Motorola launched the well-received, mid-range Moto G smartphone that cost only $179 for the 8GB version and $199 for the 16GB version. It had a quad-core Cortex-A7 processor, a 4.5-inch HD (1280x720) screen, and 1GB of RAM. These specs were seen in devices that cost almost double at the time such as the HTC One Mini or the Galaxy S4 Mini. With similar specs for half the price, the Moto G offered great value to customers looking for a low-priced, mid-range smartphone.. Then, about six months later, Motorola launched the even cheaper Moto E. Aimed at the 3G only market, it cost just $129 and came with a dual-core Cortex-A7 processor, a 4.3-inch qHD (960x540) screen, and also 1GB of RAM.. However, this device did not deliver the same value as the Moto G. It had a significantly worse camera with no flash, which is important for many customers in emerging markets, and no front-facing camera either. Motorola cut too many corners to create a device that was “only” $50 cheaper, which is why most people still recommended the Moto G over the Moto E. The Moto G was a much better package overall.. For the second generation of the Moto E, Motorola is offering two different versions that get several significant upgrades. There’s still a 3G only version for $120, but now there’s a 4G LTE version too for $150. Both models include 8GB of internal storage (twice as much as the original Moto E) and support microSD (up to 32GB). Battery size has also increased substantially from 1980mAh to 2390mAh, a 20% improvement. The new Moto E also adds a front-facing camera—a serious omission on the first generation—and the rear camera gets autofocus. Each version comes in either black or white.. The display has grown compared to the last generation Moto E, increasing from 4.3-inch to 4.5-inch. However, it keeps the same 960x540 resolution (245 PPI). Considering that the competing Lumia 635 comes with an even lower 854x480 resolution, the Moto E’s qHD resolution seems adequate for this price range.. 4.5-inch IPS @ 960x540 (245 PPI). 0.3 MP, 1/11" Aptina MT9V113, 2.2μm, f3.0. 5 MP, 1/5" Samsung S5K5E2, 1.12μm, f/2.2, AF, HDR.

Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 LE, 4G LTE (Cat 3), microUSB 2.0. 137.9 x 68.8 x 8.1 mm, 128g. Moto E 4G LTE (2nd gen). The second generation Moto E 3G still uses a Snapdragon 200 SoC like that found in the original version; however, it moves from a dual-core to quad-core Cortex-A7 CPU.. The Moto E 4G LTE, which we’ll be focusing on in this review, uses Qualcomm’s latest low-end SoC, the Snapdragon 410, which is the successor to the Snapdragon 400 found inside both generations of the Moto G. It has a quad-core 64-bit Cortex-A53 CPU and an Adreno 306 GPU.. This puts a bit of a kink in Motorola’s product lineup, since the Moto E 4G LTE should offer better system performance than the Moto G (2nd gen). Add in LTE support and it starts looking like a great value compared to the 3G only Moto G that costs $30 more. But what the Moto G lacks in system and wireless performance it makes up for with a larger, higher-resolution display, stereo front-facing speakers, and better cameras front and rear (with LED flash). The Moto G really needs LTE support to make it the clear mid-range option.. These jumbled system specs are a result of the staggered six-month release schedule, which gives the Moto E access to newer hardware. With LTE support becoming ubiquitous, we suspect this idiosyncrasy will disappear in Motorola’s third generation products.. The Snapdragon 410 SoC in the Moto E 4G LTE version includes Qualcomm’s third-generation Category 4 LTE modem on package. Functionally equivalent to the Qualcomm MDM9225 baseband processor, it offers 150 Mb/s down and 50 Mb/s up with carrier aggregation. It also supports HSPA+ Release 10 for 84 Mb/s down using dual-carrier HSDPA, along with most major radio modes, including GSM/EDGE, UMTS (WCDMA, TD-SCDMA), LTE (LTE-FDD, LTE-TDD), CDMA1x, and EV-DO Rev. It does not support CDMA2000, however.. We were unable to confirm this, but it’s likely that the primary transceiver is paired with the WFR1620 receive-only transceiver, since this baseband generation can’t support full Category 4 LTE speeds on its own.. The two 3G variants utilize the Qualcomm baseband integrated into the Snapdragon 200 SoC, delivering 3G speeds up to 42 Mbps. It supports GSM/EDGE, WCDMA, CDMA1x, and EV-DO Rev.

Lenovo k30-W for the win all the above + HD ready resolution 720p internal storage 16GB the only con, is there OS, which is good, but not really vanilla android. i bought one and had to return it, it restarts while charging and motorola at this moment hasn't solved the problem, a shame because it is a nice fast phone. The only international variant mentioned is the XT1505 but there are more. I found very interesting the XT1523 which has 16GB, dual sim and digital TV reciever.. There might be an error in the speaker/sound part above. "Plugging in a set of good headphones provides a similar listening experience. Relative to the iPhone 6, bass has less punch and the Moto E lacks clarity; the signal-to-noise ratio seems higher." The S/N ratio on the Moto E should be LOWER, not higher if it sounds like its lacking clarity.. There might be an error in the speaker/sound part above.

The S/N ratio on the Moto E should be LOWER, not higher if it sounds like its lacking clarity.. site posting is not working well...Either nothing or multiples. I must have been thinking of THD, which is expressed as a percent. - Matt Humrick, Mobile Editor, Tom's Hardware. The S/N ratio on the Moto E should be LOWER, not higher if it sounds like its lacking clarity.. I also purchased this phone and experience the restart while charging issue. Also, the performance is on par with a very, very basic Lumia 510 I had the misfortunate of having to use for a short time. And I mean by just hitting the home screen instead of closing out of apps. And even that takes an inordinate amount of time. I'm talking a noticeable 3-4 seconds after you hit home: your background wallpaper shows up, but no icons or app try icon, then another second or 2 later the icons show up. As well is its 1GB of memory. If I'm in the car I use bluetooth and Google Play Music / Google Maps. If I begin navigating to a destination and begin playing music Maps will close. I'm assuming due to lack of sufficient RAM. If I'm at a stop light and open snapchat, Google Play Music, Maps or Waze will close if I view a Snap. It's really rather frustrating the more you use the device. And I don't have many apps on here at all. Essentially just FB, Twitter, Snapchat, Waze, WatchESPN, HBOGo. It's frustrating seeing reviews like these on this phone that don't actually put it through its paces for a decent amount of time.. I'm sorry you had a poor experience, but thanks for taking the time to add your story. This is why we included the HTC Desire Eye in our performance evaluation, so our readers could see the performance delta between some lower-cost devices and last year's flagships running Snapdragon 801 SoCs, which are now considered mid-tier. Our unit did not experience the restart while charging issue, and while this comes as no solace to you, the Moto E handled its 1GB of RAM better than the Lumia 830 did during our testing and evaluation. - Matt Humrick, Mobile Editor, Tom's Hardware. I also purchased this phone and experience the restart while charging issue. Also, the performance is on par with a very, very basic Lumia 510 I had the misfortunate of having to use for a short time. I've experianced BT connectivity problems with both the Moto G and this new Moto E when connected to various cars. I'd be wary purchasing these phones if you rely on BT connectivity in your cars.. Interesting reading and thanks for the review. I bought the original Motorola-E (3G) for an older family member as a replacement for their aging Nokia clamshell phone that barely managed a days life depite having a new battery. The problem was not only living in a relatively weak signal area but more that it was constantly running Bluetooth whilst being paired with a car-stereo for hands-free operation. Therefore I assumed that a more modern cellphone with a newer Bluetooth implementation could last a whole lot longer. After extensive internet research I dicovered that the original Motorola-E had very good battery life (a few day of talk time) and very good call-quality, and seeing as said family member was likely to be using it mainly for calls I could assume that the internet-reviewed (hammered!) battery-life could thus be extended, and indeed this was proven correct. At that time and around 90-100 GBP from the local Argos & SIM free I considered it a cheaper alternative for a mainly calls, minimum data use (unless at home on the WiFi of course - I'm thinking of updates), small-ish, slightly rugged; Gorilla-Glass, removable back-cover and serviceable (replacement batteries). A throw in the bag type mobile that might survive a re-shuffle with other items in said bag (keys, pens, loose-change, etc.). It also uses a (charger not supplied) standard micro-USB connector for charging, so the car-charger and home-charger can be any number of generic cheap types. Thieving was another consideration, hence a cheaper-end phone hopefully providing a less attractive target. A chubby-stylus was added for less that a pound, the type that can be attached with a small line to the headphone socket for safe keeping, as older family members tend to have drier skin and so touch screens aren't always as accessible to them. The only thing missing iirc was the camera light that can be a handy aid on dark nights, however to mitigate that the main-screen illumination can also be sufficient for emergency use. I have to say that I am still pleased with the original Motorola-E purchase and have to wonder how the battery life compares with light useage when the newer model likely required a larger battery due to the faster processing power and extra electronics that it now facilitates, some can be switched off I know but always leaking power.. I have an issue with the Battery Life tests you've done. The new 2015 Moto G uses the same 2390mAh as the new Moto E, and not the 2070 mAh. The 2070 mAh is used in the old Moto G versions. So, while the 4.5in screen of the Moto E would increase battery lifetime over the 5.0in Moto G, the difference should not be that big.. The Moto G (2nd gen) has a 2070 mAh battery according to Motorola, and this is the model we tested. I should have used the generation nomenclature (like in the text) in the chart rather than the year to avoid confusion. - Matt Humrick, Mobile Editor, Tom's Hardware.

So, while the 4.5in screen of the Moto E would increase battery lifetime over the 5.0in Moto G, the difference should not be that big.. There are currently 4 versions of the Moto G: The original, released in Nov 2013, which had 4.5in screen, 5 mpx cam, and 2070 mAh The updated one, released in May 2014, same specs except had storage expansion and LTE, same 2070 mAh. The first 2nd gen, released in Sep 2014, which had 5in screen, 8 mpx cam, no LTE, same 2070 mAh. The updated 2nd gen, released in Feb 2015, same as above, except has LTE and 2390 mAh. This is the one you should have been reviewing, but i guess you mixed them up. Dont believe me, here's the comparison of the last 3 versions (the original excluded cause the site can only compare 3 at a time) http://www.phonearena.com/phones/compare/Motorola-Moto-G-LTE,Motorola-Moto-G-2014,Motorola-Moto-G-LTE-2015/phones/8655,8898,9155 And before you say that site has it wrong, ALL proper reviews comfirm it has 2390 mAh battery, and decent battery life span in tests backs this up. And I even checked at my usual online shop and confirmed it as well.. While a 4G version of the Moto G (2nd gen) with a larger 2390 mAh battery does exist, my understanding is that it was only ever released in Europe. There is no mention of it on Motorola's US website, and when I requested a Moto G review unit from Motorola, they sent me the 3G (2nd gen). Have you actually seen one for sale in North America? Can you buy one unlocked? I checked online and could only find the 4G (1st gen) for sale. - Matt Humrick, Mobile Editor, Tom's Hardware. There are currently 4 versions of the Moto G:. Well, that is the oddest thing I have ever seen. Why wouldn't Motorola sell the best version of their merchandise in the US of all places? That's just bad business in my opinion. Well, at least the confusion is cleared up, but the review is misleading to anyone in Europe..

It's definitely confusing, but not as bad as the Galaxy Note 4, for example. It comes in over 20 different SKUs for different regions and carriers, and they have different combinations of SoCs, baseband processors, audio codecs, camera sensors, etc.! While we have readers from all over the world, the main Tom's site focuses on North America. We do have regional Tom's sites (UK, Germany, France, Italy, etc.) that cover products sold in those areas, though. - Matt Humrick, Mobile Editor, Tom's Hardware.

Page 1 of 2 Motorola Moto E 2nd Gen review: Great value and performance at a budget 1. Motorola Moto E 2nd Gen review: Great value and performance at a budget 2. The camera isn't great, but the new Moto E is still great value, with a bigger, better screen, faster internals and a longer-lasting battery. Processor : Quad-core 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 410, Screen Size : 4.5in, Screen resolution : 960x540, Rear camera : 5-megapixel, Storage : 8GB, Wireless data : 3G, 4G, Size : 130x67x12.3mm, Weight : 145g, Operating system : Android 5.0.2. Motorola Moto E 2nd Gen review: Design Motorola Moto E 2nd Gen review: Android 5.0 & Moto apps Motorola Moto E 2nd Gen review: Camera. Since the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 arrived in the market, it put pressure on other budget smartphone manufacturers to step-up their game. The Ultra 6 was so good, that it not only outclassed the. 2nd Gen Moto G , but also the 3rd Gen Moto G. This also gives the cheap 2nd Gen Moto E a run for its money.. The Ultra 6 is a 5.5in smartphone, and we know that not everyone wants to have a large smartphone - the 2nd Gen Moto E is a 4.5in phone, making it a lot easier for some to use it for. The 2nd Gen Moto E has 4G support, a great screen, a fast quad-core processor, a front camera, good amounts of storage and runs Google's. Originally reviewed at £109, it can now be found for under £90 .. The new Moto E is based around a 4.5in display and is a compact if slightly chunky 130x67x12.3mm.. In terms of looks, though, the new Moto E retains the same comfortable, ergonomic design as the original Moto E and its strong unibody chassis makes it by far one of the best-made phones you're likely to find under £110.. ^ Here's the Moto E with the optional Grip Shell case, that replaces the band around the edge of the screen and covers the rear of the case. The only major difference is rather than having a removable back panel, you can now detach the phone's frame and swap it for different coloured bands or transparent grip shells, adding an extra touch of style and personality to its otherwise plain white or black chassis. Both are very easy to put on, but getting the bands off again will either need a sharp set of nails or a bit of elbow grease. Still, underneath the band, you'll find. slots for a micro SIM and microSD card, which can expand the phone's 8GB of onboard storage up to 32GB.. We're pleased to see some of Motorola's premium features make their way down to the new Moto E as well. For instance, the Moto app lets you configure Motorola's Moto Display, which shows the time and small notification icons when the screen's turned off. You can also jump straight into those notifications by sliding your finger up toward the top of the screen, or ignore them by swiping to the left or right.. Admittedly, this isn't quite so important now that Android 5.0 does essentially the same thing on the lock screen, but it's still nice to be able to see the time without having to press any buttons whatsoever.. Sadly, the new Moto E's Moto Display is nowhere near as responsive as the version on the Moto X , as we found the phone often wouldn't register that we'd picked it up, showing nothing but a blank screen.. This is a shame, as this is by far one of our favourite Motorola features and, if it was on par with the Moto X, would give the Moto E a serious advantage over its more expensive cousin, the Moto G, which currently doesn't have Moto Display support.. ^ Moto Display is very handy if you want to save battery, but it's a shame it's not quite as responsive as the Moto X's Moto Display. Still, we certainly appreciate Motorola's other features. Sleep Mode, for instance, will keep the screen turned off at night so it doesn't disturb your sleep, but still let the phone ring or receive messages from priority contacts. Strangely, you have to configure the latter setting using the Sound & Notification's Interruption menu, but here you'll be able to decide whether you still want to receive calls, messages and event reminders during your 'downtime' hours. Here, the phone will look at your calendar to work out when you're busy and will send auto-reply texts to anyone who tries to contact you during that time.. Moto Alert makes a welcome return as well, which is particularly handy for parents if they're buying the Moto E for a child as it lets others know about the phone user's whereabouts. Follow Me, for instance, will send your current location to select contacts at specified intervals so that concerned family members know where you are, but it's also useful for tracking down friends in a large crowd.. ^ Moto Alert is a great feature if you want to keep an eye on where your friends and family are. Meet Me, on the other hand, will send texts to contacts telling them where to meet you. Lastly, Emergency will sound an alarm, auto-dial your chosen emergency contact number and send a text alert to them to let you know you're in trouble. It worked extremely well when we tried it out ourselves, both on landline and mobile numbers, so it should give you extra peace of mind if your child's out with friends unsupervised.. If you want to quickly capture a photo, you can also twist the phone back and forth in your wrist to instantly activate the phone's rear-5-megapixel camera. Admittedly, the camera isn't fantastic, as our test images alternated between looking quite muddy and far too overexposed depending on the surrounding lighting conditions. Detail was a little grainy at times as well, and the phone's HDR mode looked very harsh and washed out compared to the normal camera mode.. ^ The camera coped well with the overcast weather conditions, but the sky still looks very grainy and overexposed at full resolution. HDR mode helped correct the exposure, but also made colours look very harsh and unnatural in the process. A big difference between this model and the old Moto E is the addition of a front-facing camera. It only has a 640x480 resolution, so you're not going to get the best selfies from it, but for video chat and the quick snap, it's very handy.

The Motorola Moto E (2nd Gen) currently has an Informr score of 7.4 out of 10.. This score is based on our evaluation of 37. sources including reviews from users and the web's most trusted critics.. What's good Ability to personalize phone with interchangeable bands Decent performance during daily tasks Good battery life 4G LTE connectivity. What's bad Poor camera image quality Low resolution display leads to some fuzziness Only 8GB of space. Motorola follows up the success of their budget Moto E phone with an updated 2015 model. While it won't win any awards for best-looking smartphone, the 2015 Moto E did give experts the impression of "affordable but sturdy." It comes with an all-plastic build and interchangeable band wrapping around the rim, which hides the microSD and SIM slots. Users can customize their phone by choosing different band colors. Besides the aesthetic quality of the bands, experts add that it along with the matte back finish helped improved overall grip on the otherwise round phone. It's also a bit on the thick side at 0.5 inches but critics add that it didn't detract from its usability at all.. At 4.5 inches, the display on the 2015 Moto E is 0.2 inches larger than its predecessor though it does stick with the same 540p resolution. That means its pixel density is slight lower at 245ppi. While it wasn't generally an issue with critics they did notice some fuzziness and lack of fine detail on text and images. With that said they add that the quality of the display helped soften the blow as it provided them with good viewing angles, excellent brightness and vibrant colors. Androidpit adds that it is, "…perfectly sufficient for the casual user.". Another upgrade on the 2015 Moto E is its internal specs. It now comes with 1.2GHz quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM. While it is provided better performance than the older Moto E and Moto G, experts still warn that it is not a gaming powerhouse. Even on simpler games they experience some hiccups and, with 3D games, very noticeable lag. Still, they were able to perform more basic tasks with ease. It also comes with a mere 8GB of internal storage though it does have a microSD slot. In order to counter the more powerful processor, Motorola stuck a 2,390mAh battery in the second generation Moto E. In general, experts were able to get a full day's of use during moderate usage, but when 4G LTE is used the batteries drain fairly fast and last only 8-9 hours.. Perhaps the biggest letdown of the new Moto E is its camera. It keeps the same 5MP resolution and lack of LED flash though it replaced the fixed focus lens with an auto-focus one. That said, many experts didn't see too much of an improvement in picture quality. Images still lacked definition and detail even under optimal light conditions and, they add, colors looked artificial. When compared to the original Moto E, Ars Technica notes that it "…is a small improvement.". While there are some downsides to the Moto E (2015), reviewers still have no problem recommending it to the casual Android user. Pocket Lint states, "…the Moto E is brilliant for the price…for the money, there's arguably no better budget phone on the market.". The Moto E 4g is definitely an improvement over the 3G variant, but it still can't match the competiton in terms of display and camera. If you need an inexpensive smartphone with very good battery life, then this one would make sense, but for everything else, you should look at the Xiaomi Redmi 2 an.... The Motorola Moto E (2nd Gen) is exactly what you'd expect from the sequel of the most popular budget phone for 2014. The new model gets a screen bump, major performance boost, better camera, double the storage, a bigger battery, a much better build quality and materials and, surprisingly, there is.... The Moto E 4G is a better deal than the first Moto E was when it came out.

The Motorola Moto E (2nd Gen) is exactly what you'd expect from the sequel of the most popular budget phone for 2014. The new model gets a screen bump, major performance boost, better camera, double the storage, a bigger battery, a much better build quality and materials and, surprisingly, there is even LTE connectivity. Yet Motorola is asking only a slight premium for the new device - it's selling for £99 or €125.. A better deal than the first. The Moto E 4G is a better deal than the first Moto E was when it came out. The addition of 4G connectivity, a decent chipset, Android 5.0 and a bigger screen with better picture quality all make it a better buy. Unfortunately, there's a lot of competition in this price range. The Moto E 4G is a better deal than the first Moto E was when it came out.

Unfortunately, there's a lot of competition in this price range. If you can do without 4G, then you can get much more out of the Honor 3C. And if you can throw in just a bit more money, the Moto G will take you even further.. The Moto E’s negatives are few, and don’t undermine the truly superlative nature of this product.

Featuring a close to untouched version of Android, the Moto E is one of a select few affordable smartphones to offer all the perks of Google's latest Lollipop version.. Add to this its reasonable performance and battery life, and the super low £110 price, and we have to say that the Moto E is the best affordable Android smartphone currently available.. Combines high-quality parts with clean Android software. The Motorola Moto E stands as a litmus test for the ultra-budget smartphone market. The high-quality parts and clean Android software make for a potent combination, especially in the sub-$100 realm.. The Motorola Moto E stands as a litmus test for the ultra-budget smartphone market. The high-quality parts and clean Android software make for a potent combination, especially in the sub-$100 realm.. The build and the choice of materials are very good, and would also look good in even considerably more expensive smartphones. The plain and stylish design also appealed to us. The internal 8 GB storage is easy to expand for little money via a micro-SD card. Furthermore, the hardware's performance alongside the latest Android 5.0.5 operating system and long battery life is convincing. The communication modules do not exhibit any major missteps, and LTE is still the exception in this price range. That makes it easy to forgive the lack of NFC.....

The communication modules do not exhibit any major missteps, and LTE is still the exception in this price range. That makes it easy to forgive the lack of NFC.. Our verdict about the 4.5-inch screen is mixed. The IPS screen's high contrast and great black level reap in a good score, and the color reproduction is also decent. On the other hand, the low brightness is not as pleasing and makes outdoor use a bit difficult. However, the camera modules and the squeaky speaker are really disappointing.. Smooth performance, good build quality, good battery life. Moto E was one of the popular smartphones in India when it launched last year. Motorola has improved a lot this time in the Moto E (2nd Gen), but the phone still lacks LED flash. Since it lacks flash you can’t use the most handy torch-light feature in Lollipop that lets you open the torch directly from the Quick Settings menu. At a price tag of Rs. 6,999, Moto E (2nd Gen) is not the best smartphone in the price range when you have tough competition like the Xiaomi Redmi 2 that offer better specifications, including 4G support for the same price.....

One thing that Motorola does the best is offering stock Android experience and updating its phones to the latest version of Android earlier than its competitors. If you want stock Android Lollipop experience at this price with some compromises like flash, and don’t want to go for an Android One device, this is a good choice.. The Moto E is a competent, capable smartphone for people who don't want to (or can't) break the bank on a mobile device. The $120 handset is fantastic value in a vacuum, but it's difficult to fully recommend when Motorola's other budget device, the Moto G, brings a superior display and design for just $60 more..

One of the cheapest off-contract smartphones you’ll find. We are extremely impressed with the Moto E. Considering the $150 price point we would have been happy with a slightly larger screen over last year’s model. Or, perhaps just adding in 4G LTE support. Fortunately for us, we get both of these as well as the latest release of Android. Throw in the better camera details and battery it’s all bonus.... We are extremely impressed with the Moto E.

Fortunately for us, we get both of these as well as the latest release of Android. Throw in the better camera details and battery it’s all bonus. At $120, the 3G variant is still plenty of smartphone for someone making the leap from feature phone. Both are attractive enough in price to consider one of these as a backup or replacement for a lost or damaged model. It’s going to be hard to recommend any other brand over Motorola at this price range. Sure, Blu, Huawei, and a few others are treading into that space and offer compelling devices, but we’ve got to give the nod to Motorola. There’s more than enough here to merit the money and the brand is one we’ve been all too pleased to learn to trust again. The Motorola Bands and Grip Shells are a nice touch that help users get a more personalized design. You’ll spend a few bucks to do so, yes, but you’re still walking away with a semi-personalized, low-cost smartphone with leading edge Android. Oh, and it’s also unlocked and waiting for your micro-SIM card. If this is indicative of what a post-Google and Lenovo-owned Motorola is going to do then we’re on board.. It is a cheap smartphone which is more than sufficient for an average user. Decent battery life and standby time. it is affordable rate very good works well.

The slightly larger second generation Moto E is an evolution of the original all-plastic design and has the same style as Motorola’s other phones from the past couple of years. The latest Motorola devices all share similar traits such as a slightly curved and smooth back, rounded corners and edges, a depressed circle with the Motorola logo on the back, and front-facing speakers (only one for the latest Moto E). It also feels quite solid and well-built, typical for Motorola’s latest smartphones, although it’s slightly more hollow feeling than the Moto G (2nd gen).. At 12.3mm (the same as the old Moto E), it’s almost twice as thick as some of the latest flagship smartphones, but it’s not a major issue for day to day use. The bezels are slightly thinner, improving the screen to body ratio to 64.3% versus 63% in the previous generation. This is still a bit chunky compared to the Motorola-made Nexus 6, which has a ratio of 74.1%. However, reducing bezel size adds to the cost, and the Nexus 6 has more internal volume to accommodate the motherboard.. Centered above the screen is the single earpiece/speaker, flanked on either side by the front-facing camera and ambient light sensor. The lack of the second speaker on the front does make it look less Moto’ish.. The depressed circles on the back of Motorola’s phones have been praised for their ergonomics, making it comfortable to rest your finger on the phone’s back during a phone call. In the Moto E’s case, this dimple is more aesthetic than functional because of its size. Even with small hands, the index finger ends up resting closer to the camera rather than the dimple.. The Moto E (2nd gen) does not have a removable back like the older model. Instead, Motorola offers colored bands to liven up and personalize your phone. The plastic bands have the metal volume and power buttons built into them, and are easily snapped on and off by placing a fingernail in a small gap in one of the corners.. The base white and black phones come with a matching colored band, although the black band is of a slightly lighter black than the phone itself. Additional bands can be purchased in two packs of three for $20. The first pack includes turquoise, purple, and raspberry (pink), while the second pack contains red, blue, and yellow.. If you would like to add some protection to the phone while adding some color, Motorola sells optional Grip Shells. The shells also have a colored plastic band around the perimeter, but add a color-matched, translucent plastic shell to protect the back of the phone. The Grip Shells attach directly to the sides of the phone in the same way the bands do. They cost $20 each and come in the following colors: blue, yellow, charcoal, turquoise, and raspberry.. The SIM card and microSD slots are located on the left side opposite the power and volume controls. In order to access them, the band or Grip Shell needs to be removed..

Lenovo k30-W for the win all the above + HD ready resolution 720p internal storage 16GB the only con, is there OS, which is good, but not really vanilla android. i bought one and had to return it, it restarts while charging and motorola at this moment hasn't solved the problem, a shame because it is a nice fast phone. The only international variant mentioned is the XT1505 but there are more. I found very interesting the XT1523 which has 16GB, dual sim and digital TV reciever.. There might be an error in the speaker/sound part above. "Plugging in a set of good headphones provides a similar listening experience. Relative to the iPhone 6, bass has less punch and the Moto E lacks clarity; the signal-to-noise ratio seems higher." The S/N ratio on the Moto E should be LOWER, not higher if it sounds like its lacking clarity.. There might be an error in the speaker/sound part above.

The S/N ratio on the Moto E should be LOWER, not higher if it sounds like its lacking clarity.. site posting is not working well...Either nothing or multiples. I must have been thinking of THD, which is expressed as a percent. - Matt Humrick, Mobile Editor, Tom's Hardware. The S/N ratio on the Moto E should be LOWER, not higher if it sounds like its lacking clarity.. I also purchased this phone and experience the restart while charging issue. Also, the performance is on par with a very, very basic Lumia 510 I had the misfortunate of having to use for a short time. And I mean by just hitting the home screen instead of closing out of apps. And even that takes an inordinate amount of time. I'm talking a noticeable 3-4 seconds after you hit home: your background wallpaper shows up, but no icons or app try icon, then another second or 2 later the icons show up. As well is its 1GB of memory. If I'm in the car I use bluetooth and Google Play Music / Google Maps. If I begin navigating to a destination and begin playing music Maps will close. I'm assuming due to lack of sufficient RAM. If I'm at a stop light and open snapchat, Google Play Music, Maps or Waze will close if I view a Snap. It's really rather frustrating the more you use the device. And I don't have many apps on here at all. Essentially just FB, Twitter, Snapchat, Waze, WatchESPN, HBOGo. It's frustrating seeing reviews like these on this phone that don't actually put it through its paces for a decent amount of time.. I'm sorry you had a poor experience, but thanks for taking the time to add your story. This is why we included the HTC Desire Eye in our performance evaluation, so our readers could see the performance delta between some lower-cost devices and last year's flagships running Snapdragon 801 SoCs, which are now considered mid-tier. Our unit did not experience the restart while charging issue, and while this comes as no solace to you, the Moto E handled its 1GB of RAM better than the Lumia 830 did during our testing and evaluation. - Matt Humrick, Mobile Editor, Tom's Hardware. I also purchased this phone and experience the restart while charging issue. Also, the performance is on par with a very, very basic Lumia 510 I had the misfortunate of having to use for a short time. I've experianced BT connectivity problems with both the Moto G and this new Moto E when connected to various cars. I'd be wary purchasing these phones if you rely on BT connectivity in your cars.. Interesting reading and thanks for the review. I bought the original Motorola-E (3G) for an older family member as a replacement for their aging Nokia clamshell phone that barely managed a days life depite having a new battery. The problem was not only living in a relatively weak signal area but more that it was constantly running Bluetooth whilst being paired with a car-stereo for hands-free operation. Therefore I assumed that a more modern cellphone with a newer Bluetooth implementation could last a whole lot longer. After extensive internet research I dicovered that the original Motorola-E had very good battery life (a few day of talk time) and very good call-quality, and seeing as said family member was likely to be using it mainly for calls I could assume that the internet-reviewed (hammered!) battery-life could thus be extended, and indeed this was proven correct. At that time and around 90-100 GBP from the local Argos & SIM free I considered it a cheaper alternative for a mainly calls, minimum data use (unless at home on the WiFi of course - I'm thinking of updates), small-ish, slightly rugged; Gorilla-Glass, removable back-cover and serviceable (replacement batteries). A throw in the bag type mobile that might survive a re-shuffle with other items in said bag (keys, pens, loose-change, etc.). It also uses a (charger not supplied) standard micro-USB connector for charging, so the car-charger and home-charger can be any number of generic cheap types. Thieving was another consideration, hence a cheaper-end phone hopefully providing a less attractive target. A chubby-stylus was added for less that a pound, the type that can be attached with a small line to the headphone socket for safe keeping, as older family members tend to have drier skin and so touch screens aren't always as accessible to them. The only thing missing iirc was the camera light that can be a handy aid on dark nights, however to mitigate that the main-screen illumination can also be sufficient for emergency use. I have to say that I am still pleased with the original Motorola-E purchase and have to wonder how the battery life compares with light useage when the newer model likely required a larger battery due to the faster processing power and extra electronics that it now facilitates, some can be switched off I know but always leaking power.. I have an issue with the Battery Life tests you've done. The new 2015 Moto G uses the same 2390mAh as the new Moto E, and not the 2070 mAh. The 2070 mAh is used in the old Moto G versions. So, while the 4.5in screen of the Moto E would increase battery lifetime over the 5.0in Moto G, the difference should not be that big.. The Moto G (2nd gen) has a 2070 mAh battery according to Motorola, and this is the model we tested. I should have used the generation nomenclature (like in the text) in the chart rather than the year to avoid confusion. - Matt Humrick, Mobile Editor, Tom's Hardware.

So, while the 4.5in screen of the Moto E would increase battery lifetime over the 5.0in Moto G, the difference should not be that big.. There are currently 4 versions of the Moto G: The original, released in Nov 2013, which had 4.5in screen, 5 mpx cam, and 2070 mAh The updated one, released in May 2014, same specs except had storage expansion and LTE, same 2070 mAh. The first 2nd gen, released in Sep 2014, which had 5in screen, 8 mpx cam, no LTE, same 2070 mAh. The updated 2nd gen, released in Feb 2015, same as above, except has LTE and 2390 mAh. This is the one you should have been reviewing, but i guess you mixed them up. Dont believe me, here's the comparison of the last 3 versions (the original excluded cause the site can only compare 3 at a time) http://www.phonearena.com/phones/compare/Motorola-Moto-G-LTE,Motorola-Moto-G-2014,Motorola-Moto-G-LTE-2015/phones/8655,8898,9155 And before you say that site has it wrong, ALL proper reviews comfirm it has 2390 mAh battery, and decent battery life span in tests backs this up. And I even checked at my usual online shop and confirmed it as well.. While a 4G version of the Moto G (2nd gen) with a larger 2390 mAh battery does exist, my understanding is that it was only ever released in Europe. There is no mention of it on Motorola's US website, and when I requested a Moto G review unit from Motorola, they sent me the 3G (2nd gen). Have you actually seen one for sale in North America? Can you buy one unlocked? I checked online and could only find the 4G (1st gen) for sale. - Matt Humrick, Mobile Editor, Tom's Hardware. There are currently 4 versions of the Moto G:. Well, that is the oddest thing I have ever seen. Why wouldn't Motorola sell the best version of their merchandise in the US of all places? That's just bad business in my opinion. Well, at least the confusion is cleared up, but the review is misleading to anyone in Europe..

It's definitely confusing, but not as bad as the Galaxy Note 4, for example. It comes in over 20 different SKUs for different regions and carriers, and they have different combinations of SoCs, baseband processors, audio codecs, camera sensors, etc.! While we have readers from all over the world, the main Tom's site focuses on North America. We do have regional Tom's sites (UK, Germany, France, Italy, etc.) that cover products sold in those areas, though. - Matt Humrick, Mobile Editor, Tom's Hardware.

Rate & review this product and help other customers. Best budget mobile with No Marshmallow update. Mobile is good at this price range. But they failed their promise of delivering updates. No updates were made since the purchase. Seems that 4G variant is getting Marshmallow update only in some places. Since Lollipop 5.0 has memory leak issues, close all the apps and restart the mobile daily to fix the hanging problem.. Reviewed on MySmartPrice. Report spam 0 0. Moto E 2015 version is the successor to Moto E. It is the best of Motorola till now (considering the budget segment). It seems to overrule other smartphones in this range. It comes in two variants-3G and LTE. We will be reviewing the 3G model Let us figure out what makes it everyone's favourite- 1) Design and Display- Its design is similar to that of the Moto G 2nd gen. It spo rts a 4.5 inch IPS LCD display offering a 540 x 960 pixels resulting in a poor 245 ppi pixel density. However, due to the Gorilla Glass 3 and oleophobic coating, it is strong enough. Although, the resolution is not up to the mark, the viewing angles are good and clarity can be observed in text while browsing. You may see colours turning upside down while auto rotation but that's alright. Physically, it is built very well. It is a good rugged device. Weighing 145 grams only, it feels light and comfortable in hand. The looks aren't that great but the quality of hardware used is pretty nice. You have the speakers placed at the top and capacitive buttons at the usual places. You can expect quality components and loud sound which will fill up the room. 2) Performance and RAM- It boasts a Quad core Snapdragon 200 Cortex A7 clocked at 1.2 Ghz clubbed with 1GB RAM. The only problem with the previous model was a dual core processor but now this issue has also been resolved. The performance on Moto E 2nd Gen is similar to Moto G Gen 2. It has an Adreno 302 sitting inside. You can swipe here and there smoothly without any noticeable lags but for gamers, it might be a nightmare. Due to the Snapdragon 200 chip and Adreno 302, gaming is not that great. It can do your daily tasks with ease but HD games might lag a bit. But, considering the price, I would rather not discriminate it. But, I must say that it is majorly meant for daily tasks, games, multitasking, and a good user experience instead of heavy games. 3) Software and Interface- The most exciting part is that it comes with Android 5.0 Lollipop and is further upgradable. Lollipop is surely a sweet upgrade from Kitkat. It brings new innovations and changes in UI. You have a redesigned settings app, better notification centre, screen pinning, faster connectivity, lots and lots of animations, battery saver, enhanced Google Now, Swype keyboard and much more. The performance is also very much smooth without any stutters. Better optimization of apps and play store will make you love this phone. It has negligible bloatware unlike other phones which offer beefy specs with lot of bloatware inside. 4) Camera and Features- There are no upgrades to the camera. It is still a 5MP one. You have a poor VGA secondary camera and no flash. This is quite disappointing for selfie fans. The photos clicked in low light would not be appreciated at all. During the daytime, it still captures somewhat better pictures but overall it lacks that clarity and crispness. Also, it has only 2 sensors-Accelerometer and Proximity sensor to cut down the price. 5) Battery and Storage- Here is something really great done by Motorola. Moto E 2nd Gen comes with a huge battery backup of 2390 maH which is sure to last a day at least after heavy usage. Frequent travellers and lazy people do not have to their phones intermittently due to a huge battery life. On the storage front, you have 8GB of onboard storage but not to worry as it is upgradable to 32GB via micro SD card. You can download apps, games, music, etc blindly as by spending a little on microSD cards, you can expand the storage. Verdict- Moto E 2015 is really a good challenger. It is priced at Rs 6,999. The major difference between Moto E 2nd gen and other phones is the user experience. You have no bloatware and Google software inside. Other phones use their own ROM's and fill the phones with useless things. Also, it offers good specs at this price and after all it's a branded phone too. The compromise you have to make is on the camera, sensors,display and heavy HD games.. Rest seems to be well and good. If you love Nexus and Motorola (or Google) devices, then I recommend it. Overall, considering the brand value, price, features, competition in the market, I rate it 4.5 stars out of 5. Reviewed on MySmartPrice. Report spam 0 0. Motorola mobile price list in India.

Motorola Moto E (2nd Gen) review. Camera, image quality, video recording 8. Motorola Moto E (2nd gen) specification User opinions and reviews Review comments (67). Available as a Dual SIM models on certain markets (HSPA+ XT1506) and (LTE XT1521). 4.5" qHD (540 x 960 pixels) IPS LCD display with 245ppi; Corning Gorilla Glass 3. 4 LTE 150Mbps): 1.2 GHz quad-core Cortex-A53 CPU; Adreno 306 GPU; Snapdragon 410 chipset. 3G model (HSPA+): 1.2 GHz quad-core Cortex-A7 CPU, Adreno 302 GPU; Snapdragon 200 chipset. 5MP auto-focus camera; 720p video capture; 0.3MP front-facing snapper. 8GB of built-in memory; microSD card slot, up to 32GB. Wi-Fi b/g/n; Bluetooth 4.0; GPS/GLONASS; FM radio, USB OTG. Android 5.0 Lollipop OS (5.1 most likely on the way). 3G model comes with a dated chipset. Uses 32-bit Android OS despite 64-bit CPU. Almost a year later we are getting the second generation Moto E, which improves on the basics established by its affordable predecessor. The Motorola Moto E (2nd Gen) continues the legacy of a lag-free Android system provided by a powerful hardware set on a bargain price. This time however, the build quality is noticeably better and the screen size is more adequate.. The new Moto E got a tiny .2" screen bump to 4.5", but keeps the resolution at 540 x 960px presented on an IPS LCD matrix. The Snapdragon 410 chip is in charge of operations on the new Moto E (2nd Gen) for an even better and faster performance. There is LTE connectivity, too, plus the internal storage got doubled to 8 gigs. Finally, camera geeks will be happy to learn the camera has been improved with auto-focus and HD video recording.. Oddly, Motorola will be also offering a slightly less-capable 3G model, which is powered by the rather dated Snapdragon 200 chip, while keeping the rest of the novelties. Let's explore the complete feature list.. The Snapdragon 410 upgrade, which offers LTE connectivity is the most welcome new feature with the Moto E (2nd Gen). We really doubt many people will go for the lesser 3G model, which seems behind the curve, but maybe with a proper pricing it could serve as a good alternative. The build quality on both devices should be identical and it's a huge improvement on the last year's Moto E. The lack of removable battery is probably the biggest flaw of the new Moto E, but then again that's where most of the droids, including the Moto series, are heading today..

http:/ / www.phonescoop.com/ articles/ article.php? a=15369. Hands-On: Motorola Moto E, 2nd Gen. Motorola's new Moto E handset improves specs across the board, including the screen, processor, and storage. Here are our first impressions of Motorola's low-cost smartphone.. Motorola unveiled the Moto E today, a second-generation entry-level Android smartphone. Motorola's last handset was the Nexus 6, a spec monster. The Moto E is the polar opposite. It keeps with the strategy Motorola revealed in mid 2013 with a simpler design, straight-up Android, and no nonsense with respect to features.. Outwardly, there's little to differentiate the new Moto E from the original. It is a compact handset made of mid-grade plastics. The design language mirrors that of Motorola's X, G, and Nexus 6 smartphones and the familial relationship is obvious. For example, there's the chrome-colored bar protecting the earpiece speaker and the familiar indented "M" logo on the back. The phone comes in black or white, but you can spice up its looks a bit with a replaceable band that runs around the outer edge. The unit we received from Motorola was pure white, but I put a red band on it so you can see how it looks. There's a purity to the looks that I find appealing.. The footprint makes the E comfortable to hold and use. The 4.5-inch screen, up from the original's 4.3-incher, allowed Motorola to keep the phone small. It's got a pleasant curve to the back surface to help the phone sit deeper in your palm. The Moto E a little bit on the thick side of things, but that's common for smaller handsets. It fits into pockets no problems.. You can't find fault in the phone's materials or construction, especially given the price point. The plastics have a nice texture and the matte white finish is attractive. The seams are all tight and the phone is put together expertly.. Controls are kept to a minimum. The phone uses the on-screen buttons, so there are no keys below the display. The screen lock button is on the right side, as is the volume toggle. They both have excellent profiles, making them easy to find and use. Travel and feedback is very satisfying. Theres a USB port on the bottom and a stereo headphone jack on top. If you want to add a memory card, you'll need to pull off the colored band. The ports for the memory card and SIM card are buried under the band on the left side of the phone. The back cover cannot be removed.. The display has qHD resolution, or 960 x 540 pixels. At first blush, it looks sharp enough and bright enough for this class of device. It doesn't compare to the amazing quad HD screen of the Nexus 6 nor the full HD screen of the Moto X, but it's far better than the 800 x 480 screens you'll see on similarly priced phones from other manufacturers. Viewing angles are pretty good, but I saw a little bit of blue shift when the screen is tilted side-to-side.. Since mid 2013, most Motorola phones run an unadulterated version of Android. The Moto E ships with Lollipop and no bloatware. Motorola's useful and thoughtful extras, such as the Quick Capture gesture and Glance Screen for notifications, are on board. In the few moments I spent fiddling with the phone this afternoon, the UI looked great and the phone didn't have any trouble running multiple apps at a time.. The camera is solid at 5-megapixels, and Motorola added a VGA user-facing camera (the original didn't have a selfie cam). The biggest addition to the Moto E is of course LTE 4G.. The Moto E went on sale today. The 3G version costs $119 and the LTE 4G version costs $149. That's for an unlocked handset, mind you. The Moto E is a bargain.. Review: Motorola Moto E for Cricket Wireless. Motorola's second-generation entry-level smartphone includes a bigger screen, faster processor, LTE 4G, and the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop operating system from Google. This budget phone is a steal.. Cricket to Sell Motorola Moto E Beginning March 13. Cricket Wireless today announced plans to sell the second-generation Motorola Moto E starting on March 13. The phone features LTE 4G, a 4.5-inch display, 5-megapixel camera, quad-core 1.2GHz processor and runs Android 5.0 Lollipop.. Motorola Updates Moto E with LTE. Motorola today introduced a second-generation Moto E with improved specs. Like its predecessor, the new Moto E is an entry-level handset.. Sprint to Sell Motorola Moto E Across Its Prepaid Brands. Sprint today said it plans to sell the Motorola Moto E from Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, and Sprint Prepaid this month. The Moto E, which has a larger screen and supports LTE 4G, is available in white from Boost Mobile beginning today for $99.99.. Verizon Prepaid Selling Moto E for $99. Verizon Wireless's prepaid business added the Motorola Moto E to its lineup of devices today. The second-generation handset from Motorola sports a 4.5-inch screen, Snapdragon 410 processor, 5-megapixel camera, and 4G LTE.. Motorola Moto E (2nd gen., LTE/CDMA). 1 GB RAM 2,390 mAh battery. Headphone Jack (3.5mm), Water-Resistant, Memory Card Slot. Motorola Moto E (2nd gen., LTE/GSM). 1 GB RAM 2,390 mAh battery. Headphone Jack (3.5mm), Water-Resistant, Memory Card Slot. I'm wanting to buy my brother a new phone. Moto E for $150 or Moto G for $180. Is the G worth paying more? He lives in Peru, but comes back to the states once a year for about 2 months. Budget=Moto E G is mainly bigger now with a slightly better display. The E now is on par perfomance-wise with the G just smaller with the display and display quality. So its almost an even handoff now between the two. The E has 4G and if Peru does n... The hands on stated no bloatware. Google has thrown their proprietary bloatware all over the Moto E, G, and X. Anything and everything a Google app is on the phones unless you root the phones and then you lose the auto-updates for software. When Google bought Motorolas mobile division, this is when all their bloatware appeared on all the phones.. Any info on which LTE bands it has? T-Mobile support?. According to Motorola's website, the US LTE version will have support for LTE bands 2, 4, 5, 7, 12 and 17. Pretty impressive that it supports LTE band 12. This phone will work fine with T-Mobile's network.. Subscribe to news & reviews with RSS. Review: ZTE Avid 4 for MetroPCS. ZTE's latest low-cost handset for MetroPCS offers entry-level specs and performance. It includes a 5-inch screen, 8-megapixel camera, and Android 7 Nougat. MetroPCS customers can score this handset for next to nothing, but there might be better options. Here is Phone Scoop's in-depth review.. Hands On with the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+. Samsung's new flagship handsets, the Galaxy S9 and S9+, are here and they offer lots to be excited about.

Stand-out features include a dual-camera system for capturing bokeh-style portraits, and a fingerprint reader for security. Here is Phone Scoop's in-depth report..
