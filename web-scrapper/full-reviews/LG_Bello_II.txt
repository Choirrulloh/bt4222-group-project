LG Bello II - user opinions and reviews. it says android 5.0.2 in my phone, also no updates, also rooted but nothing else modified, works perfect. The variant in the EU or atleast on the Balkans is with a 5MP rear camera and 2MP front (selfie) camera. No gyro, no way to root, and no way to move apps to the SD card. I have this phone since 24th of December 2015, and I have changed the lockscreen.... I got this cellphone the last week as a work cell just for calls and whatsapp and is perfect, is fast, 0 lag, no heat, great battery, the white model looks awesome. If only the camera was better this would be a great deal device, for work and first....

The LG Bello II includes a 1.3 GHz quad-core CPU, which seems unchanged from that of the original L Bello (pictured above), and there's a reasonable 1-gig of RAM.

Florian Wimmer ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 12/20/2015. Android ARM Touchscreen Smartphone. Not quite a year lies between LG's L Bello and LG's Bello II. The "L" in the name has disappeared; in return, it now features an updated Android OS and new design. However, the rear-facing camera also has a lower resolution, and the Bello II is heavier..

Best Notebooks for University Students Â». Top Windows alternatives to Apple's MacBook series Â». Â» Tablets , Â» Windows Tablets Â» Smartphones. For the original German review, see here .. Users who like the rear-sided controls of LG's phones can actually stop reading here. They have been omitted in LG's Bello II - perhaps for cost reasons. The smartphone is even cheaper than the former. It still has a low-resolution 5-inch panel and 8 GB of internal storage. The casing, cameras, weight and operating system, which is now Android 5.0, have been modified. At first glance, no real progress is obvious, and we will thus now take a detailed look at how LG's Bello II fares.. Test device courtesy of LG Deutschland. Download your licensed rating image as PNG / SVG. 5 inch 16:9, 854 x 480 pixel, capacitive touchscreen, IPS, glossy: yes. 1 USB 2.0, Audio Connections: 3.5 mm combo audio jack, Card Reader: micro-SD max. 32 GB, Sensors: GPS, motion sensor, proximity sensor, compass. 802.11 b/g/n (b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.1, GSM (850/900/1800/1900), UMTS (900/2100), GPS. height x width x depth (in mm): 9.6 x 140.8 x 71.6 ( = 0.38 x 5.54 x 2.82 in). 10 Wh Lithium-Ion, removeable, 2540 mAh, removable, Standby 2G (according to manufacturer): 21. h, Standby 3G (according to manufacturer): 10.

Unlike the predecessor that followed the design of the upper-range LG G3 S, LG's Bello II has received an individual design.. and LG's Bello II hardly have a family resemblance now. The review sample's casing looks a. bit more angular, the color option of our black model with silver design elements is richer in contrast. Gold and white are further color options.. More differences are found on the rear. The surface is no longer brushed but features a subtle pattern and is roughened, the camera is now circular, and the rear-sided controls have been axed. It is again possible to remove the back, making the battery easy to replace.. The casing makes an overall high-quality impression and is plain, yet with a classy design. The stiffness could be higher; the screen can be dented clearly particularly in the center, and the chassis can be warped evidently.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. The SoC is the same as in the predecessor, and the storage capacity has not been modified, either: 8 GB of internal storage and a micro-SD slot that accepts cards of up to 32 GB. Again, a micro-USB 2.0 port and a 3.5 mm jack for headsets are present as physical interfaces.. Android 5.0 is preloaded on LG's Bello II. It is not the latest version of Google's operating system - version 6.0 has been launched. Apart from the usual Google apps and a file manager, no superfluous apps are pre-loaded, giving the user more capacity for personal programs.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

As previously said, LG's Bello, unfortunately, does not feature LTE. However, it supports four frequencies in the GSM network and UMTS network. That should make it possible to find a network fairly reliably at least when travelling in Europe.. Wi-Fi standards 802.11 b/g/n are supported. A signal of three-quarters is received even at a distance of ten meters from the router and through three walls, and pages are opened quite fast.. The GPS module is in fact a small highlight of LG's Bello II. Although localization is not possible indoors, a good signal is available within seconds outdoors. We were tracked with an accuracy of 7 meters.. LG relies on Google's stock phone app software. That is alright because Google's phone app is quite self-explanatory and is not very puzzling.. The clear reproduction is compelling, but the microphone is very noisy and also produces side noises. Consequently, our contact does not perceive a good sound quality while we are quite satisfied..

The front camera takes satisfactory photos in unfavorable conditions. The cameras in the Bello II make it obvious that LG has recognized an important trend: selfies! Thus, the front-facing camera has been furnished with 2 megapixels, which is a considerably higher resolution than that of. The rear-facing camera has been reduced from 8 to 5 megapixels.. The rear-facing camera reproduces colors decently, although the colors are slightly oversaturated. However, blurred color transitions and minor image noise becomes evident even when zoomed lightly, and they are also very visible in good light conditions. The image sharpness is not satisfactory in some situations and bright surfaces quickly look overexposed.. The front-facing camera is now more suitable for snapshots than its predecessor. The color reproduction and image quality are acceptable, but the photos should not be blown up too strongly.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window.

LG has opted for a more conventional design in its Bello II and positions the standby button on the right and volume control on the left. The buttons do not have a first-rate feel, but the pressure point is fairly clear. The user will often be looking for the buttons at first since they barely jut out of the casing, making them difficult to feel.. Inputting via touchscreen and onscreen keyboard functions quite reliably. However, the screen sometimes has too much resistance for the finger. Google's stock keyboard that is clearly arranged and quick to type on is installed.. The resolution has not been increased compared with the predecessor, and thus the 5-inch screen still has a resolution of a low 854x480 pixels. The reproduction is decent, but looks more blurry than on Full HD panels. Other smartphones in this price range have at least a 720p resolution, resulting in a minus point for LG's Bello II.. The average brightness of 333.2 cd/mÂ² is also lower than among the competition. However, the illumination of 90% is relatively homogeneous, and larger colored areas look consistent.. 325 cd/m² 326 cd/m² 344 cd/m² 320 cd/m² 333 cd/m² 355 cd/m² 320 cd/m² 334 cd/m² 342 cd/m². 90 % Center on Battery: 333. cd/m²) ΔE Color 9.41 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 11.15 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.17.

LG's Bello II defeats its rivals in black value and can even outperform some more expensive devices with its 0.23 cd/mÂ². That leads to a good contrast ratio of 1448:1, which could have naturally been higher in conjunction with a better brightness. Besides that, the contrast fluctuations due to unstable viewing angles prevent a consistent reproduction of actually pleasantly dark areas.. Our measurements using the CalMAN tool and spectrophotometer record high shifts to the reference color space in both grayscale levels and colors. Furthermore, a strong bluish tint is visible.. The low maximum brightness and glossy surface is noticed unfavorably outdoors. The smartphone can be used in the open quite comfortably on cloudy days, though.. Although the manufacturer states that an IPS panel is installed, it does not have a positive impact on the viewing angles. The contrast fluctuates strongly depending on the angle the screen is viewed from.. At least LG's Bello II sports a quad-core SoC: The. that clocks at a maximum of 1.3 GHz. the predecessor and does its job sufficiently fast in total. Occasional stutters during use and when starting apps cannot be completely avoided, though. LG's Bello II does not present a stable impression in the benchmarks. It is sometimes much faster than the comparison devices and sometimes slower. Overall, the devices will likely be roughly on the same performance level, particularly since almost all are based on the same SoC.. The graphics card is an ARM Mali-400 MP and clocks at 500 MHz. It is also installed in almost all comparison devices, and thus the results are similar here.. LG's Bello II cannot quite keep up with its rivals in terms of internal storage. They are usually a bit faster in reading and writing data. It is at least much faster than its predecessor.. LG's Bello II is in fact a bit faster in Internet browsing than the other smartphones we use for comparison. However, the differences will unlikely be noticed for the most part in use..

The low resolution in demanding games like Asphalt 8: Airborne usually leads to smooth rendering even using high details. Casual games with less demanding graphics, such as Angry Birds , do not cause problems anyway.. Navigating via position sensor and touchscreen also functions well, but the touchscreen's high resistance is sometimes an issue here as well.. LG does an almost perfect job in temperature management. The maximum load temperature is 36.8 Â°C, which is palpable but not yet unpleasant. Thus, LG's Bello II can be held comfortably in the hand in every situation.

Like in the predecessor, the speaker in LG's Bello II is situated in the casing's lower left. The positioning is not ideal, and especially right-handed users might muffle the speaker's sound unintentionally. The sound is not really compelling even when it is not muffled; basses are non-existent, and the sound is similar to that of a bathroom radio. The volume is not particularly high, but at least nothing overdrives.. Unfortunately, we cannot make comparisons with the power consumption of. rates could be determined from the predecessor. Compared with the other comparison devices, LG's Bello II is a real energy-saving champion. does a marginally better job with a minimum consumption of 0.5 watts, the average idle consumption of 1.1 watts of LG's Bello II is at least much lower than other smartphones from this price range.. The maximum load consumption of just 2.5 watts is even 4 watts lower than that of. Off / Standby 0 / 0.1 Watt Idle 0.6 / 1.1 / 1.3 Watt. LG's Bello II might not have the highest capacity battery in the comparison field with 9.7 watt hours, but it manages second place with the equally sized battery in the predecessor. That alongside the very low consumption rates translates into very good battery runtimes. The user can browse on the Internet via Wi-Fi for over 13 hours without depleting the battery. The precursor also delivered good rates here, but they were outperformed. LG's Bello II is also an endurance runner with over 5 hours under load.. NBC WiFi Websurfing Battery Test 1.3 13h.

Review sample courtesy of LG Germany.. It is very visible to just what extent the smartphone market changes within one year: The price pressure has once again increased clearly, and thus LG was forced to make cutbacks in its Bello entry-level smartphone. The rear-sided controls and high-resolution rear camera have been axed.. LG's Bello II also feels inferior in other aspects: For example, the screen has considerably inferior viewing angles. However, nothing has been modified in most places: The storage is still just as big, LTE is not available, and the screen's low resolution is still a shortcoming.. In return, the buyer still gets a relatively high-quality chassis for this price range; temperature management and power consumption have even been optimized. That is also the reason why LG's Bello II can play its biggest trump card in the battery life tests. The low power consumption leads to first-rate battery runtimes, and the more modern Android 5.0 might also be a decisive purchase factor.. Compared with the predecessor, there are both pros and cons, and the buyer can ponder on whether the high-resolution rear camera or longer battery life is more important. Buyers looking for an HD screen will be disappointed by LG's Bello lineup from the outset and should look around at the competition. Otherwise, LG's Bello II is once again a solid entry-level smartphone that openly displays the price pressure in late 2015.. LG Bello II - 2015-12-15 12/15/2015 v4 (old) Florian Wimmer.

LG Bello II - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 4 ». it says android 5.0.2 in my phone, also no updates, also rooted but nothing else modified, works perfect. The variant in the EU or atleast on the Balkans is with a 5MP rear camera and 2MP front (selfie) camera. No gyro, no way to root, and no way to move apps to the SD card. I have this phone since 24th of December 2015, and I have changed the lockscreen wallpaper TWICE since then - on the day of purchase and around 6 mths later. 5 or 6 factory resets and no way to change it. When I try to change it - it says saved, tried 10 different apps. Even brought it to a phone repair shop. Stuck on those ugly deserts like on the picture. First time - I succeeded, and the next time (it was a 1080p phone wallpaper that I chose) the phone crashed. It started to display the error "System UI stopped working. [OK] [Report [Wait]" every 2 seconds. I barely had the patience to go to Factory reset. Lost all chats (this time), and unbacked up photos (I usually use Google Photos, but I didn't have Wi-Fi that day so I left them for home). I can barely fit 5 apps, and I have to delete other apps so I can update one. The apps I currently have are PayPal, Facebook, Messenger, Snapchat & Google Photos. I have a 32GB memory card. The lack of NFC is bad. So are the speakers - bad. Really quiet and the sound is fuzzy. Battery is kind of okay, I mean, you barely use any apps, 'cause you almost have none of them, what could suck that much battery. I don't recommend this phone to anyone that uses more than 5 apps on a daily basis, or wants a custom lockscreen background. I didn't mean to turn this to a rant, but it happened.. I got this cellphone the last week as a work cell just for calls and whatsapp and is perfect, is fast, 0 lag, no heat, great battery, the white model looks awesome. If only the camera was better this would be a great deal device, for work and first cellphone for kids is really great. This is a good one ! perfect for me!. Good phone i am using it for 9 months. stat Oi, 10 Dec 2016 will not turn on even though the full battery and was not damp or damaged Most likely power button flex problem.Common on this model.. will not turn on even though the full battery and was not damp or damaged. sfawzy, 02 Oct 2016 i have same problem apps are not moving from phn mmry to sd card wtf it is plzzz sum1 gvme the solution of this shitty prblm. sfawzy, 02 Oct 2016 i have same problem u also have same prblm plzzzz sun1 gvme this shitts solution&#128530;&#128530;.

Sistema multitouch con interfaccia LG UI 4.0. Non supporta la rete 4G LTE. Sistema operativo Android OS, v5.1.1 Lollipop. GPS integrato, A-GPS, Bluetooth 4.0 A2DP. Fotocamera principale da 8 megapixel 3264x2448p. Memoria interna 8 giga espandibile fino a 32 giga. Prezzo consigliato al momento dell'uscita : 199,00 € (8 giga). Siti consigliati per l'acquisto : AMAZON - MEDIAWORLD - EBAY - PIXMANIA. Per eventuali altre info sull'oggetto : Sito LG ITALIA. Dopo la prima versione esce la seconda del modello Bello della LG. Uno smarthphone che va a colpire una fascia di prezzo bassa avendo features non eccezionali. Che ne pensate e che giudizi ed opinioni avete di questo nuovo LG Bello II ? Avete già visto sue foto, immagini, il suo video trailer ufficiale su Youtube o online su altri siti ? Questo LG Bello II è uscito con nomi diversi in altri Stati. In Brasile e Cile è uscito con il nome LG Prime II mentre in Messico e in India con il nome di LG Max. Ma quanto è grande il suo schermo, da quanti pollici è ? La sua batteria è abbastanza potente ? Supporta la rete 4G LTE ? Quanto costa, qual è il suo prezzo ? Le due fotocamere da quanti megapixel sono e memoria Ram ed interna da quanti giga sono ? C'è la possibilità di inserire una micro-sim ed è uno smartphone mono sim o dual sim ? Monta micro o nano sim ? Lo schermo è IPS LCD oppure TFT o ancora Super Amoled ? Infine quale chipset, processore e scheda grafica possiede ed il sistema operativo è Android ma in che versione ? Ecco una review, una recensione sullo smartphone LG Bello II con caratteristiche, specifiche e scheda tecnica , immagini, giudizio del team e prezzo finale al pubblico italiano.. CARATTERISTICHE - LG BELLO II. Questo smartphone può essere acquistato con micro sim oppure nel modello con dual sim. Purtroppo non supporta la rete 4G LTE ma quelle più datate come GSM e HSPA. Ha uno schermo da 5 pollici con tecnologia IPS LCD e che raggiunge uan risoluzione di 854x480 p con una densità per pixel pari a 196 ppi, quindi non un grande schermo per la verità anche se possiede un sistema multitouch con interfaccia proprietaria dal nome LG UI 4.0. Il processore, supportato da un sistema operativo Android OS Lollipop in versione 5.1.1 è un quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7 di cui però non conosciamo il chipset ma pensiamo non possa davvero lavorare ad alti livelli anche considerando la sua frequenza di lavoro non eccezionale e nonostante sia a 64 bits. La memoria Ram è da 1 giga mentre quella interna è da 8 giga ma espandibile fino a 32 con l'utilizzo di. una micro-sd e quindi per fortuna esiste lo slot per essa altrimenti 8 giga sarebbero davvero stati pochini. La connettività wifi è affidata ad una scheda wlan non dual band e che quindi gestisce solo le frequenze 2.4 GHz ed i canali da 1 a 14 ma possiede per lo meno la funzione di hotspot ed il Wifi-Direct. È presente il Bluetooth in versione 4.0 A2DP per lo scambio di dati mentre non vi sono NFC e DLNA. Il gps è di tipo A-GPS e naturalmente sono presenti accelerometro e sensore di prossimità , davvero pochi sensori quindi. Le due fotocamere sono discrete con la principale che raggiunge una risoluzione massima di 3264x2448 p ed è di 8 megapixel mentre la secondaria è di soli 5 megapixel. La principale possiede un sistema di autofocus ed un flash al led e funzioni come geo-tagging, touch focus, panorama. Sempre la fotocamera primaria può registrare video in full HD quindi fino a 1080p a 30 frames per secondo. La batteria è da 2540 mAh rimovibile agli ioni di Litio ma non ci è dato sapere quanto possa durare in uso stand by e connessione 3G attiva oppure in uso chiamata sempre con connessione 3G attiva. Non ritroviamo il supporto per Java e nemmeno un browser HTML5 ma abbiamo un lettore interno di documenti ed un editor di foto e video .. SPECIFICHE - LG BELLO II. FOTO 1 - LG BELLO II. FOTO 2 - LG BELLO II. SCHEDA DI VALUTAZIONE - LG BELLO II. Giudizio del team : il Bello in prima versione della LG si trova ad un prezzo intorno ai 140 euro circa e quindi è lecito aspettarsi che la nuova versione si avvicini ma non superi i 200 euro. E speriamo che sia così perchè questo smartphone non ha le giuste features per andare oltre questo prezzo. Uno schermo non eccezionale con una risoluzione molto bassa senza parlare della sua pixel density, un processore non molto potente anche se pensiamo che alla fine sia la cosa migliore di questo LG , due fotocamere anch'esse non eccezionali ma soprattutto solo 1 giga di memoria Ram ed 8 di memoria Rom che per fortuna può essere espansa fino a 32 giga. Questo LG Bello II quindi, secondo noi, non è all'altezza di altri smartphone presenti nella stessa fascia di prezzo e mercato e pensiamo e speriamo che il suo prezzo possa presto scendere..

In effetti il prezzo da quando è uscito è calato moltissimo e mi sembra pure giusto, 199 euro erano troppi. Considera però che il modello indicato nell'articolo e venduto in altra Stati europei ha caratteristiche diverse. In Italia in effetti sembra essere uscito con fotocamere con megapixel inferiori e mi sa che pure la potenza della batteria è inferiore. Ecco anche il motivo di un prezzo basso, condierando poi che siamo a Natale gli sconti sono forti..
