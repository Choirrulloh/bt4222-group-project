Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars Got this at best buy for $149 without any research as I was .... Got this at best buy for $149 without any research as I was looking for a cheap phone while in Austin as my overseas phone could not connect to my careers data network and I needed Google Maps to go around. Big bright screen which is great for GPS use. Good cellular data connection and Wifi connection. I did not make many calls so cannot speak about call quality. After all day use with heavy google map usage and no calls it goes down to ~55%. It is hard to find a case for it at local stores. If you need a cheap unlocked phone cannot do better than this. Update: 08/16/16 After about a month and a half of use I am sorry to say that the phone has failed. It reboots randomly every 10 minutes or so. I use google maps a lot as I am new to the area I live in and phone just reboots as I am trying to drive to where I am going. They asked me to do a factory reset as well as clear the cache. I am going to send the phone to get it fixed but I have to get another phone in the mean time. I used cheap phones before but this is the first one that failed so quickly. Update: 08/19/16 Got a call from Alcatel customer service and they said they will send me a new phone at no cost and asked me to send the defective one back once I received the new one. The gentlemen read my review but could not find my contact however, he checked the customer service database and got my contact from there. I call this good customer service. I will update my review once the new phone comes hopefully with no reboot issue. Update 08/23/16 Got the updated phone and am very happy. I even got a free return label to ship back the old phone. the replacement phone is rebooting now as well :( I think this must be a common problem as I see other are having the same issue now. Update: 11/13/16 The rebooting issue is gone. The phone has not rebooted by itself for about a month now. It has been working quite well. It does have trouble tethering but I rarely do this.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Goodbye Samsung!. I have previously had brand name phones on contract my last one being Samsung Note Edge (5" screen). The screen is clear and the 6" size is awesome. volume is loud, GPS works great, call quality is clear. Photos are adequate with the 5MP camera, battery life is great. The home screen it comes with is nice but I installed Nova Settings app which is even better. I also installed the Swiftkey app to replace the stock Android keyboard. I am using it on Straight Talk AT&T and have a great signal. I had previously tried the Posh E600 and this is far better for about the same price or less..

alcatel Pixi 4 (6) - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 … 11 12 ». Cyco972, 14 Feb 2018 I have searched for an opinion board for this phone. I couldn't wait to say something. I have searched for an opinion board for this phone. I couldn't wait to say something. This is without a doubt the absolute worst phone I have ever had. The apps, browser, hell everything freezes and doesn't work correctly. Its a cheap phone but its not worth a penny. If you have a choice between a dirty penny on the ground in an alley, or this phone. The penny would and should be your choice. Phones this poorly made should be against the law. Do not buy this phone please. I am tempted to collect names and numbers to file a class action lawsuit against this company and the worst phone in the history of humanity.. awesome phone in all never froze and nothing wrong with it only it doesn't have much for data space for apps.. Since the summer 2017 system upgrade, the phone often freezes, like perhaps once a day, It also has connectivity problems (I have to switch from 4G/3G to 3G/2G to reset, and back again). It also had bad battery and became slow until I loaded up an app to spin down background apps and unloaded facebook and facebook messenger. While the connectivity problems and freezing still happens, it's now fastish (though still requires rebooting now and then) and the battery lasts a good while. There was something pretty bad about that update.. This phone is as slow as a week in the jail and completely invisible to Windows. What you might call a "stealth phone", which would be great if you're looking for a communications device that no one else can detect and which will jealously refuse to share any media files contained within. In short, this is the single biggest pile of shite in both the history of piles - and of shite.. Had this phone for 3 weeks. Worst phone I have ever owned. Takes forever to get into any apps if at all. Have to turn off phone tehn back on to receive texts sometimes. Got this model 3 mths ago and since then dying to write about it.MY PIECE OF ADVICE ....."NEVER BUY THIS BRAND".I have other brand before..Nokia,Sony.Samsung but this the worst..The sound quality is bad.it is not loud and even can decrease on its own.it can automatically off.sometime the keyboard ,you have to pressed it many times...it really make my blood rise... The phone is shit,laggy af,freezes every 5 seconds,horrible blurry camera.Worst phone I ever owned by far,Alcatel=shit phones. nsayorbung, 21 Sep 2017 i also hav a problem with internal storage which i saw online as 16gb but its actually 8gb wit... more yeees same thing is happening to me how can we resolve this. This phone is a piece if shit. After 1 month of owning it the soft keys (home, back, recent apps) quit working and the auto rotate quit working, says "binary file error." The 2 year warranty is a joke also, I contacted Alcatel who says they doesn't support this phone anymore. Anonymous, 03 Nov 2017 What problem you faced exactly? Hi! I have just looked off my phone last night and up till now when I am trying to turn it on only thing I saw is the Digicel. I am facing this problem from 2nd week since I bought this phone RFC / rfc keys are not working when holding phone vertically while the are OK in horizontal position can anyone help me. How do you stop AD's coming up all the time. Alcatel Pixi 3 4.5, 09 Sep 2017 You are correct. I don't own this mobile but Alcatel phones are better then they used to be, i... more Its frontal camera is not clear..not work and during video calling the other person on call even can't see your face due to low quality of camera. Frontal camera is really in low quality. Can anyone help me please ?&#128591;&#127995;&#128591;&#12­7995;. Have owned this phone for about 4 months. After about 1 month the bottom soft keys quit working (same thing happened on the ZTE avid trio this replaced) No support from Alcatel. Have been using a soft key app so phone is still usable.. Alcatel Pixi 3 4.5, 06 Sep 2017 If you do a system reset it may give you a little more storage space... how do you do this reset ? (my pixi regularly gets off despite the battery being still 30% or 20%). Rose1946, 30 Oct 2017 DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PHONE. more What problem you faced exactly?. And what about Xiaomi Redmi 4X and Xiaomi Redmi note 4X ?. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PHONE. To late to return to Best Buy for refund or exchange. Referred to Alcatel for manufacturer warranty. I will NEVER purchase another Alcatel product.. Hi, everybody ! I'd just like to know how much SAR (EU) value is for Alcatel One Touch (8050D) Pixi 4 (6.0). Pages: 1 2 3 … 11 12 ».

Hay 83 opiniones del Alcatel Pixi 4 (6) .. hola una pregunta, alguien sabe como activar la luces de las tres figuras de telefono la flecha el circulo y el cuadro. Ola buenas tardes alcatel one touch pixi 4 es una marabilla de telefono pero queria saber si son tan amables de desirme como le activo la luz del led para las notificaciones si son tan amables. Esta información es errónea el Alcatel Pixi 4.4 8050E lleva Android 5.1 y Procesador Mediatek 6850 el que lleva android 6 y procesador Snapdragon es el. yo quiero hacer una pregunta se le puede cambiar la bateria al alcatel pixi 4 modelo 8050g? lo que pasa que lo cargo y me indica que la bateria esta llena al 100% lo desconecto y empiezo a utilizarlo pero no me dura ni 5 min. funcionando, se apaga¡¡ lo vuelvo a preder y me sale una leyenda en donde dice que se esta actualizando pero de rato se apaga nuevamente entonces para podeer utilizarlo es necesario tenerlo conectado por medio de la computadora con su cable para poder utilizarlo, entonces quiero saber si se le puede cambiar la bateria ya que pienso que igual sea eso lo que ya n o funciona por que de hecho el telefono funciona bien ecepto por la bateria jajaja, espero que lean mi comentario y me puedan dar una solucion. A veces no siempre, me llaman se enciende la pantalla sin sonido y aparece -llamada de...- si no quito el bloqueo no suena la llamada. lo q hago es quitar la batería volver a ponerla y, entonces, se soluciona hasta la próxima.. he comprado 2 pixix4 me parecen excelentes para ser de esta gama .....pero igual en uno de ellos la camara trasera dejo de funcionar y no se por que. adquiri este cel pero no le funciona las notificaciones via luces led, unicamente prende al cargar la bateria.. Me parece buen celular lo acabo de rutear para ver como se comporta.. No se xq pero mi alcatel pixi4 "6" tiene un gran rendimiento a mi parecer pero lo malo ay es que lo conecte a mi computador y de la nada se quedo la cámara lo reinicie y no funciona la cámara trasera que coraje.

Evine is unable to accept prepaid cards on ValuePay orders.. Check out ValuePay for more information.. Please see the Unlocked Phones FAQ tab for a video and frequently asked questions!. Please Note: This mobile phone will not come activated with wireless services. End user must contact the carrier directly to select service plan and activate. Evine does not sell or provide customer support for wireless service. For issues arising after 30 days from purchase, you must contact the provider for support or facilitate warranty returns/exchanges with Consumer Certified Repairs (1-866-603-0640) directly. For additional information please contact service provider or the manufacturer directly. Battery power consumption depends on factors such as network configuration, signal strength, operating temperature, features selected, vibrate mode, backlight settings, browser use and data and other application usage patterns.. It's basically a mobile phone that's not tied to a single network or service plan at the time you purchase it. You simply buy the phone and then get it connected to any compatible network and service plan you choose. An unlocked phone needs a SIM card from a communications service provider or carrier before it will work.. Unlocked phones use either CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) or GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) networks with an interchangeable SIM card. The GSM network is used by AT&T and T-Mobile while the CDMA network is used by Sprint and Verizon. When you buy your unlocked phone, make note of which networks it can utilize so you can find the appropriate service provider.. A SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card is a small, removable plastic card with a chip that holds personal information such as your phone number, address book, text messages and more. The SIM card also includes a security key with authentication information that specifically identifies the phone. Typically, an unlocked phone will not include a SIM card. You'll likely receive one through your carrier when you connect your phone to a new or existing service plan. Regardless of the SIM card's origin, the unlocked phone will recognize it and start sending voice and data over the network.. What are the advantages of an unlocked phone?. The first big advantage of an unlocked phone is that you're not limited to the small selection of devices that a particular carrier offers. You get to choose your unlocked phone from any of the available mobile devices that have a SIM card slot and are compatible with your network.. Along those same lines, you can buy an unlocked phone and add it to your current service plan without requiring a new contract. (Note that bringing the unlocked phone to a new carrier will most likely require you to sign a contract with that carrier.) You can take any SIM card from any carrier and put it in your unlocked phone as long as the phone is compatible with the network and bands. So, if you sign up your unlocked phone for service with AT&T and decide later to switch it to T-Mobile, you can still use the unlocked phone you originally purchased.. And with an unlocked phone, you don't need to wait for your contract to expire to upgrade your phone. Instead of waiting for your contract renewal to get a new phone, you can purchase an unlocked phone and use it now on your existing service contract. The added benefit is that when your current contract is up, you'd be free to cancel your plan and switch to any network or carrier you wanted – taking your phone with you to your new plan and carrier! You could also purchase prepaid plans so you'd have no monthly fees.. One last thing for you international travelers: With an unlocked phone, you'd be able to purchase and install a new SIM card from a carrier operating within your destination country so you could avoid paying the astronomical roaming charges associated with using a mobile phone outside the United States. And maybe you just want to purchase a cheaper unlocked phone for your trip and leave your expensive phone at home to keep it from getting lost, stolen or damaged.. What are the disadvantages of an unlocked phone?. When purchasing a new "locked" phone, the carrier often subsidizes the cost of the mobile phone. (They're making money off the service plans and other add-ons, not the device itself.) So an unlocked phone does not benefit from the subsidy offered when bundling the phone with a carrier contracted plan. You're responsible for the entire cost of the phone up front..
