Press enter or click on the search icon. Toshiba TS803 – 3G Music Phone. Page 1 Toshiba TS803 – 3G Music Phone. The race to cram as many features as possible into mobile phones has become a bit like the frantic pursuit of ever faster processor speeds in the late Nineties. No sooner has one new development hit the market, then manufacturers are looking to outdo one another with something else.. It feels a bit like innovation for the sake of it sometimes – for my money phone manufacturers should be concentrating on polishing their communications offerings before venturing forth into the world of entertainment. For now, though, the novelty of being to do everything bar freezing a bag of peas with your phone is shifting units and the latest 3G phone from Toshiba – the TS803 – is right at the forefront of the trend.. It’s a phone that James Bond’s resident eccentric weapons and gadget meister Q would be proud of – on paper at least. There’s no stone left unturned here. Toshiba has managed to squeeze an MP3 music player, music video functions, streaming TV, video calling features and more into one single chunk of silicon and plastic. The only disappointment is that there’s no high-powered laser, tranquilliser dart or instant tripwire built in as well.. Our review sample came preloaded sample tracks and videos from the recent Oasis gig at Cardiff’s Millenium stadium – where the phone was launched – so it’s not hard to see what sort of a market Toshiba is aiming the phone at. With the TS803, Toshiba’s main target is music phones such as Sony Ericsson’s W800i, Nokia’s N Series phones and Motorola’s Rockr.. I was itching to try it out. Could it rival a stand-alone player? Would the sound quality be any good? Is there any point to watching TV and music videos on a mobile?. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. There's very little wrong with this Toshiba, but it also has very little to distinguish itself from the masses. In Europe, Toshiba is a relative newcomer to the mobile phone scene, with the TS803 as its 3G music offering. It's a well equipped multimedia handset with a sharp 2.3-megapixel camera and dedicated music controls. The 2.2-inch high resolution screen is a treat and the buttons are big enough for beefy fingers.. The phone functions as a music player supporting the MP3 and AAC file formats. Files are stored on a mini-SD memory card, which comes in capacities up to 1GB.. Sound quality is respectable, but without the highs and lows you'll get from a dedicated player.. The TS803 has an impressive 2.3-megapixel camera for shots you can print off. However, we found we needed a steady hand to avoid blurry images.. The Toshiba TS803 is larger than your average mobile, but not much bigger than most other 3G handsets, and it's ideal if you want to travel with a single gadget. It lacks the design flair of its competitors, but it's free on contract exclusively from Vodafone.. You can unsubscribe at any time and we'll never share your details without your permission..

I give 4 stars because they send me several code instead of 1 code it's very annoying because I have to try several codes before I get one works other provider only provide one code.. I had a problem but they resolved it quickly. I recommend this website to anybody who wants their phone unlocked. Once again thank you and I have been using this website for over six years. Very simple process which worked first time - received codes within 3 days. Телефон разблокировали очень быстро сервисом очень доволен хотя и чуть-чуть дороговато.

Home ▸ Reviews ▸ Mobile ▸ Cell Phones ▸ Toshiba TS803 Cell Phone Review. Trustedreviews took a look at the Toshiba TS803 cell phone and they were not entirely impressed. They did like its intuitive face front control for MP3 use, but found the TS803’s sound quality poor, and large size a bit cubersome. Furthermore, the phone would not accept VBR encoded MP3s and DRM controlled tracks. Also, don’t plan on a fast music transfer as the phone is only USB 1.1 (eeeeek). For the full review go here ..
