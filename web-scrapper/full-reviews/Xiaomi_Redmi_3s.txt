Octacore 1.1GHz processor gives you good performance. Camera with flash is mediocre under indoor lighting, however it records good photos outside in natural sunlight.. 5 inch screen makes the mobile small and gives you a good grip, while the 3gb ram is more than enough for normal multitasking.. Metal body looks good, however you would need a case to prevent scratches. The display is good, though is 720p (not Full HD like Redmi Note 3) and has got good viewing angles.. I would prefer Redmi note 3 or redmi 3s, depending on your budget or if you dont need a large display.. Officially Available on sale here - https://goo.gl/2vm6RP. Was this review helpful?

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. posted by Luis D.. Android - Android + Xiaomi - Xiaomi +. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction Low-cost Chinese smartphone vendor Xiaomi is at it again, presenting the latest addition to its Redmi line-up of affordable devices, the Redmi 3S. Priced somewhere between $100 – $160 in China (the price ending up a bit higher for global consumers), the handset aims to up people's expectations for affordable phones with a quality build, adequate performance with up-to-date hardware, a decent camera, and a long-lasting battery. Let's put the new pretender through its paces and see how attractive of a proposition it ultimately is! In the box: Xiaomi Redmi 3S Data and charging cable Charger SIM ejector tool Informational pamphlet Design The metal and plastic build is unquestionably generic, but pleasant nonetheless. The Xiaomi Redmi 3S is among the best-looking devices in its price category. While the design is objectively generic, this is still an elegant phone made of metal, with plastic substituting the aluminum for the top and bottom parts to aid signal reception. At 8.5mm thickness and 144 grams, the phone feels light, but sturdy. It has capacitive touch keys below the screen , a standard microUSB port, and the fingerprint sensor is placed on the back. Sold in Silver, Gray, and Gold, the phone leaves no complaints in the design department. Display An okay display whose resolution could have been higher and color temperature warmer. Outfitted with a 5-inch, 720p resolution IPS panel, the Redmi 3S display is certainly nice, but it also shows the corners cut by Xiaomi. A 1080 x 1920 px resolution would have fared better for a screen this size, improving its sharpness. Still, the presence of a night reading mode and a color temperature adjustment slider is quite welcome. While colors appear quite cold by default (at 7942 Kelvin), the screen boasts nice brightness properties and a fairly good contrast ratio. It may be an average panel, but it does the job well enough and it doesn't strain the eyes with odd imperfections and major unpleasantness.. 5.48 x 2.74 x 0.33 inches. 139.3 x 69.6 x 8.5 mm. 5.74 x 2.85 x 0.32 inches. 145.8 x 72.3 x 8.1 mm. 6.02 x 3.02 x 0.39 inches. 153 x 76.6 x 9.8 mm. 5.96 x 3 x 0.32 inches. 151.3 x 76.3 x 8.15 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Xiaomi Redmi 3S Compare.

One question:- which is the best phone in $150 price group?. Why they even try to review any non-american phones??. (Posts: 6747; Member since: 30 Sep 2014). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 23:32. they can't just give it 6.5 score without mentioning any better phone for that price.. (its base price is 140 EUR here, and won't reach $200 even with shipping fee and tax). and its have great battery life (last more than 50% longer than competitors). at least other site is still fair enough, lol. pcadvisor.co.uk - 4/5 "The best £120 you'll spend today". (Posts: 180; Member since: 28 May 2015). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 12:26. Don't pay attention to their reviews. Display : "An okay display whose resolution could have been higher" and here we have a 720p display on a 700$ phone which goes by the name of iPhone 6s. "And colour temperature warmer" while they mention in the very next para that there is a slider to adjust that. (Posts: 88; Member since: 26 Jun 2012). posted on 12 Aug 2016, 12:11. I had a hands on with that mobile in India here. Don't know what they were expecting with such a low cost mobile despite having useful specs(battery especially). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 10:07. It's really sad how poor score Xiaomi's phone get here despite being their phone having the best bang for the buck ratio.. (Posts: 8; Member since: 11 Aug 2016). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 10:23. Its a disgrace how biased the reviews on PA are. A 6.5??? Really??? 8 hours of SOT on your beloved Iphone is excellent, so what is 13 hours then? Also excellent? Wow. This is the king of budget phones for a 100 bucks. How come Samsung can make a "budget phone" for the same amount of money and the screen sucks, the performance sucks and battery sucks. You guys should really reinvent your scoring, because this makes no sense. And also it would not be a bad idea if you rename yourself to applefanarena. Then it would make more sense. If you're making reviews and you've already decided that it will suck cause it's not Apple or Samsung, why are you making it at all. It will be a feast to read your review of the upcoming Redmi 4, if you should dare to make one.. (Posts: 888; Member since: 22 Nov 2014). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 10:35. HD resolution for $120 is perfectly adequate. Snapdragon 430 doesn't suppoert DDR4 RAM. GPU performance is surprisingly decent, it's much better for games than Moto G4.. (Posts: 6747; Member since: 30 Sep 2014). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 23:38. and it doesnt overheat like SD617 inside motoG4 :P. (Posts: 1548; Member since: 04 Jun 2013). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 10:38. The review is not really fair at all. The device is truly a bang for buck no doubt about that. Even cons are not justifying the given score. They always point out non availability of device and take 2 points immediately. Of course it is a con but to really know the value of this device you have to buy it from where it is officially available. Otherwise it's like measuring the value of oxygen on a planet where people breathe nitrogen.. (Posts: 2066; Member since: 23 Jan 2014). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 10:45. 5inch 720p on a super budget device is bad but 4.7in 750p on a high end device is fine?. (Posts: 535; Member since: 20 Nov 2014). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 10:54. exactly, 16gb memory with expandable memory is a con? iphone 16gb with 5x the price will still score 9.5.. (Posts: 4589; Member since: 07 Mar 2012). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 12:02. True! Why are they complaining about the resolution?. Let's look back on a flagship of yesteryear, the note II. Granted it's old but it had an HD arrangement on a screen that spread out 5.5 inch. And it was perfectly fine...these guys are shooting too much.. (Posts: 2066; Member since: 23 Jan 2014). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 10:49. How can no world-wide network support be a con for a budget device aimed at one market?.

(Posts: 544; Member since: 28 Jun 2014). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 17:52. Wow, I think this phone should've gotten at least 7.5 for the battery alone..

(Posts: 639; Member since: 19 Apr 2012). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 19:33. Wow wow wow, chill guys, I think PA did give it a decent score ya know? I mean for a phone which is not belongs to Samsung or Apple, 6.5 would be the 8.5 of Samsung or Apple. We really should accept that the scoring scheme for PA is quite messy, I should give Redmi 3S a score of 5/7.. (Posts: 6794; Member since: 29 Mar 2012). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 21:52. It's a decent phone for those that only want to spend $100 >. (Posts: 639; Member since: 19 Apr 2012). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 22:21. It is a decent phone, I am using it, but too bad it is not Samsung or Apple, so the scoring system for PA for any non Samsung/Apple phone will be different.. (Posts: 444; Member since: 30 Jul 2014). posted on 15 Aug 2016, 04:57. in response to #22 Hide. Shows how inconsistent PA rating system is. They want to review non-American phones, yet they have to lower the score simply because it doesn't support proper cellular bands for the US itself! How silly is that?. (Posts: 3; Member since: 28 Jul 2016). posted on 15 Aug 2016, 09:20. This phone is best in budget catogery ,and even having features which no smartphone have in this catogery you are giving just 6.5. maybe they are jelous that redmi 3s is perform better than their iphone in some department..

Worst review about the Redmi 3s that I've read so far. It contains false information and a wrong estimated price. The phone, actually, starts at 110 bucks (when in very special offer) up to 150 bucks (~normal price). The camera has autofocus (!) and it's pretty fast and da_n good for that price range! (100-150bucks) Additionaly, it has also hdr-sth.. (when there are light and dark zones on a picture. The hardware is better than a simple moto-g4!! Don't believe their stats, 430 sd processor and adreno 5 FTW!. And here you get a very good (!) fingerprint-scanner and an ir-sensor (universal remote control). Also the screen is very nice and readable in sun light conditions!!. Please, absolutely (!), check other reviews before making a decision, like gsm arena and watch videos on youtube! This phone is best bang for the buck!. If very good camera pictures are REALLY important for you, than go for a) Moto g4 plus or b) LeEco LeMax2 (price range 150-250)!. (Posts: 2; Member since: 09 Jan 2017). posted on 09 Jan 2017, 08:08. I forgot, there is also the international version (with MiUi 8.x Global Stable) which supports LTE band 20!!

I think the Mi brand mobiles only works for a year not only mine but my colleague's mobiles also stopped working exactly after one year. The speaker, vibration and heating problem, etc. are common in all the Mi phones and I don't know about Infinix. But I suggest not to buy Mi mobiles, they are just looting us by fake products and we Indians are getting fooled easily by those Chinese companies.. In my opinion, both are better but I have only used 3S.. If you want to go with Infinix then, my suggestion is you can also have a look at Infinix Note 4 which has a higher battery and storage capacity with Android 7 (Nougat) at Rs. 9000 and rest of the features are the same.. For sure Redmi 3S prime is better, but now Redmi has launched one new model at the same price.. That is Redmi Y1; they also have two models at Rs. If you have an additional budget, then go with Redmi Y1.. It will be the best phone.. I think 3S mobile has a rating of 9/10.. It's a perfect phone in all the departments, i.e. But the Redmi phone has one weak point, i.e., camera, its quality is not great.. I think that Redmi 3S Prime is better but after few months, you will face some issues like hanging. The mobile will automatically restart, and also the volume of the mobile will decrease.. Is Redmi 3S, 3S Prime and 3X similar?. Except for RAM, internal storage and fingerprint sensor everything is same. Redmi 3s has 2 GB RAM and 16 GB internal storage, but in 3S Prime, 3 GB RAM, 32 GB internal storage and fingerprint sensor are available.. 3s don't have a fingerprint scanner and has a 2GB RAM with 16 GB internal storage. 3s Prime has a fingerprint scanner with 3GB RAM and 32 GB storage. While 3x is the name of 3s prime in China.. Redmi 3s, 3s prime are low and high versions.. But 3s prime and 3x are the same models. 3x is the name of China version and 3s Prime is the India version.. No, only both devices look similar, and the camera quality is same. But 3s prime has finger touch, 3GB RAM and 32GB ROM, whereas 3s has 16 GB ROM and 2GB RAM.. No, I'm not sure about it regarding looks. But the specifications would be completely different.. How to use 2 sims and a memory card in this phone?. There is no option to do this, rather you can use 2 SIMs or 1 SIM and a memory card. However, there is a solution for using dual SIM and memory card. But there is a lil' bit risk in doing this, you can go to any mobile repairing shop and tell him that you want to use both dual SIM and memory card. He will cut off your SIM from micro to mini and then take out only that network area of the SIM which is in golden colour. And then he will join that golden part to the back side of memory card. It is a very sensitive case, after doing this you will able to use both dual SIM and memory card on your phone. But you will not be able to use that SIM and memory card to another phone.. There is no option to use 2 SIMs and a memory card in Redmi 3S. Because there is a hybrid slot for SIM which is different from traditional type of slots wherein you can use either your second SIM or a memory card.. There are other options to use memory if you have active data pack. You can use Mi cloud or Google photos. There are many other online storage apps where you can use for memory.. There is a way but some say it makes the phone very hot. Just peel off the metal strip of your SIM and align it properly on the memory card and stick it. That's it, now insert it in the hybrid slot. I think there is an external slim slot that converts the hybrid slot to individual slots. You can go with this as this is a safer method.. It's a risky task but basically, we can do it.. We have to export SIM microchip from SIM card. Make sure it's not your personal SIM card. It may be damaged during this process.. So you are advised to see a video tutorial on youtube and complete it carefully.. And we have to merge MMC and SIM card.. You cannot unless you have/purchase adapter for the memory card. Other than that, you have to use just two SIMs or one SIM and a microSD card. There is another way, but it is risky, I tried it but I spoiled my SIM in the process. I tried to stick the chip off my SIM on the back of my SD card.. Does it support 2G, 3G, 4G, VoLTE, OTG, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity?. Redmi 3s Prime is better than any other phone under 9k to 10k. It is VoLTE, 4G, 3G, 2G, and OTG enabled.. It also has Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.. Redmi 3S Prime supports 2G, 3G, 4G, VoLTE, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity as per the specifications. Haven't used 2G and 3G SIM. I am not sure about OTG.. Yes, SIM1 supports all the features.. But SIM2 does not support VolLTE.. But, it supports OTG, Wi-Fi and also Bluetooth.. I guess it only supports 3G and 4G (not sure about 2G and it does support OTG, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity).. Yes, both supports 2G/3G/4G, VoLTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Connectivity and OTG. User Reviews of Xiaomi Redmi 3s. 78 Ratings 22 Reviews. 5 39. 4 15. 3 3. 2 2. 1 18.

Xiaomi Redmi 3S review: Redefining the budget segment all over again. The Redmi 3S proves that $100 phones don't have to be terrible.. Xiaomi redefined the entry-level segment in 2014 with the Redmi 1S. Two years later, the brand is at it once again with the Redmi 3S. The phone offers a metal chassis, Snapdragon 430, and a massive 4100mAh battery that will last at least two days on a full charge. Combine all of the above with a price that's nearly half of that of the budget Moto G4, and you get an inkling of what Xiaomi is trying to achieve with the Redmi 3S.. Xiaomi Redmi 3S Full review. Since the launch of the Redmi 1S, competition has intensified in the entry-level category, with the likes of the Moto E, Android One handsets, and other Chinese companies joining in. Xiaomi was able to successfully hold off other manufacturers in this segment on the merits of its products, which at the time offered unmatched value for money. After a lackluster 2015, Xiaomi is back to its ways of old, offering stellar products at wallet-friendly prices. But the competition has similarly matured, and now we have Lenovo's Vibe K5 Plus and a smaller version of the Moto G4 Plus dubbed the Moto G4 Play available for under ₹10,000 ($150). Then there's Samsung, which was somehow able to convince over 13 million customers to buy its thoroughly underwhelming Galaxy J2 2016 .. The stakes for Xiaomi are higher than ever before in India following a downturn in market share in its home market. This year, we've seen the company succeed in the budget segment with the ₹11,999 ($180) Redmi Note 3 , which became one of the best-selling phones in the country. However, the Mi 5 lost out to the arguably better OnePlus 3 in the mid-tier segment. And the 6.44-inch Mi Max, which is aimed at customers interested in watching multimedia on the go, serves a niche category.. The Redmi 3S is being offered in two variants: a base model with 2GB of RAM and 16GB storage that retails for just ₹6,999 ($105), and a Prime version (which we're testing) that has 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage for ₹8,999 ($135). Let's find out if the phone has what it takes to cement Xiaomi's position in the budget segment.. MIUI 7 based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. 5-inch 720p (1280x720) IPS LCD panel 294 ppi pixel density. Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 Four Cortex A53 at 1.4GHz, four Cortex A53 at 1.2GHz 28nm. Adreno 505 with Vulkan API clocked at 450MHz. 32GB eMMC 5.1 flash storage microSD slot up to 128GB. 13MP with f/2.0 lens PDAF, LED flash 1080p video recording. 5MP with f/2.2 lens 1080p video recording. Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1 (A2DP), GPS, GLONASS, FM radio Micro-USB, 3.5mm audio jack, IR blaster. 4100mAh battery Fast charging (5V/2A). 139.3 x 69.6 x 8.5 mm. I (Harish Jonnalagadda) am writing this review after using the Redmi 3S Prime for three weeks in Hyderabad, India. The phone was running MIUI 7 (stable build 7.5.9.0), and did not receive any updates over the course of the review. I tested the phone's VoLTE capabilities on Jio's network, but primarily used Airtel's 4G network.. Xiaomi Redmi 3S Design and screen. After varying its designs significantly over the last few years, Xiaomi has settled on a design aesthetic for its budget phones. The Redmi Note 3 introduced this new philosophy earlier this year, and the Mi Max and now the Redmi 3S have successfully built on that model. Placed next to each other, it's easy to see that all three phones share a similar design, with subtle changes in the sensor placement.. When it comes to the Redmi 3S, we're looking at a fingerprint sensor at the back (on the Prime version), an aluminum chassis with plastic antenna bands at the top and bottom, power and volume buttons to the right, and a loudspeaker at the back. The placement of the speaker grille isn't ideal, but otherwise the Redmi 3S is a well-designed and well-built handset for its price. The weight distribution of the phone is perfect, and the rounded edges at the back allow the phone to fit snugly in your palm. The massive 4100mAh battery helps to a large extent in this regard, as nearly half of the back portion of the phone is taken up by the battery.. The Redmi 3S has a chrome trim that encircles the front of the phone, albeit one that's more pronounced than the Redmi Note 3. The trim is designed to protect the screen in case of tumbles, but its paint is starting to chip off in less than three weeks' of usage. The power and volume buttons offer decent travel and feedback, and in a way are better than the ones on the Mi 5. The back, recent, and home navigation keys are labeled, but they're not backlit. Round the back, the fingerprint sensor is perfectly positioned for your index finger. There's a Micro-USB port at the bottom for charging the phone, and a 3.5mm jack at the top along with an IR blaster.. If you're in the market for a 5-inch phone that fits comfortably in your hand, look no further.. The dual SIM card slot has a metal base to hold the SIM cards securely in place, much like what we've seen on the HTC 10. The primary SIM takes a micro-SIM, which looks out of place in a nano-SIM world. If you're going to use the phone with a single SIM, you can use your nano-SIM in the secondary SIM slot without any issues, as both slots offer 4G. Note that the secondary SIM slot doubles as a microSD slot, so if you want to expand storage, you'll have to stick to the primary SIM slot.. When it comes to the overall design, Xiaomi has delivered a phone that feels much more upmarket when compared to other handsets in this segment.. The 720p panel on the 5-inch Redmi 3S isn't the most dense in this segment, but with a pixel density of 294 ppi, it is more than adequate. What the screen lacks in resolution it makes up for in brightness and color accuracy. Even though Xiaomi's hardware-based Sunlight Display mode isn't available, you're not going to have any issues with readability in bright conditions. As is the case with all Xiaomi phones, viewing angles are excellent, and colors look punchy without coming across as oversaturated. The colors gravitate to the cooler side, but the phone lets you tweak the color temperature and saturation to your tastes. There's also a Reading Mode that adds a warm filter to the screen, eliminating blue light and making it easier to read text in low-light.. Xiaomi Redmi 3S Hardware and performance. Xiaomi scored several firsts in the Indian market: the company was the first to launch a phone with a Snapdragon 650 SoC in the Redmi Note 3, and the Mi 5 was the first to offer the Snapdragon 820 in the country. The Redmi 3S marks the debut of the Snapdragon 430, which brings a lot of new features previously limited to the mid-tier segment down to the budget category.. The Snapdragon 430 features an octa-core CPU made up of eight Cortex A53 cores (four cores clocked at 1.4GHz, and four clocked at 1.2GHz), and marks the debut of the Adreno 5xx series of GPUs in the entry-level segment. The SoC is built on the same 28nm node as its predecessor, but the introduction of the Adreno 505 makes a difference when it comes to playing games. The GPU includes support for OpenGL ES 3.1, OpenCL 2.0, Direct3D 11.2, and the Vulkan API. What it boils down to is that on the Redmi 3S, visually-intensive games like Modern Combat 5: Blackout , Asphalt 8 , and N.O.V.A. 3 look better and run smoother. For several years now, the tradeoff with budget phones has been underwhelming performance, particularly when playing games, and the Snapdragon 430 addresses that deficiency. If you're looking for even more oomph, the Adreno 510 GPU on the Snapdragon 650 — which powers the Redmi Note 3 — is significantly better.. We've seen companies get away with not including basic sensors on their phones, but that isn't the case on the Redmi 3S. The phone has an ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, gyroscope, digital compass, accelerometer, and even an IR blaster that lets you control your TV, air conditioner, or AV unit (more on that later).. The Redmi 3S offers excellent hardware for its asking price.. For its asking price of ₹8,999, you get a lot of phone. The Redmi 3S Prime has 3GB of LPDDR3 RAM and 32GB eMMC 5.1 flash storage, a hybrid microSD slot, Bluetooth v4.1, GPS, 13MP camera, 5MP front camera, and a massive 4100mAh battery. Wi-Fi connectivity is limited to 2.4GHz, and the Indian SKU only has the three LTE bands that are currently used by carriers in the country: band 3 (1800MHz), band 5 (850MHz), and band 40 (2300MHz). The three bands ensure that the phone works on all 4G providers in India, but you won't be able to use the phone in another region. The Redmi 3S has VoLTE as well, which works just fine on Jio .. Even though the Redmi 3S is a handset aimed at the budget segment, you won't face any lags or slowdowns in everyday usage. The phone is remarkably adept at switching between various apps, but that comes at a cost. The phone's memory management is very aggressive, and background apps are routinely killed to conserve battery life. Even in situations where you have more than 1GB of RAM available, services running in the background are often disabled.. The fingerprint sensor is quick to recognize your fingerprint, and it works even when there's moisture on the finger. Call quality is great, but the loudspeaker's location isn't ideal for carrying out hands-free calls. The speaker itself is loud, but place it on a surface and all incoming notifications and calls will be severely muffled. I missed several calls over the course of the month as a result.. The 4100mAh battery on the Redmi 3S is nothing short of incredulous. The combination of a 720p display, aggressive memory management, energy-efficient Snapdragon 430, and a massive battery has allowed Xiaomi to deliver a handset that offers two days of battery life without any hassles.. The Redmi 3S has an amazing battery life with 6 hours screen-on time on average.. The phone blows every other handset I've used out of the water when it comes to battery life. I regularly saw close to six hours of screen-on time spread over two days of heavy usage, and there were days where I got nine hours of screen on time. During the launch of the phone, Xiaomi global VP Hugo Barra talked about how testers from the Mi community were able to get 15 hours of screen-on time from the handset on a full charge. I was skeptical at first, but after using the phone for three weeks, I'm ready to change my stance. The Redmi 3S sets the benchmark for battery life in this segment.. The Snapdragon 430 supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0, but Xiaomi hasn't implemented it on the phone. You do get fast charging at 5V/2A through the supplied charger, which takes over two hours to fully charge the phone.. The Redmi 3S runs MIUI 7 based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with the July security patch. The OS is much more stable than what I've encountered on the Mi 5 earlier this year, and the upcoming MIUI 8 update will bring a slew of much-needed features. I'm running the latest version of the OS on my Redmi Note 3, and cannot wait for the update to make its way to the Redmi 3S.. Until that time, however, you'll have to live with the niggles. When you set up the device for the first time, there is no option to restore apps from an earlier device, so your only resort is to proceed to the Play Store post initial setup and install apps individually. It isn't a big deal if you use a limited set of apps, but if you're like me and have 192 apps installed on your phone, it becomes a hassle.. Furthermore, there's no way to interact with notifications from the lock screen, and the notification shade itself hasn't undergone any major changes from the KitKat era. The icons are inconsistent, and overall the operating system lacks cohesion. You're also missing out on Google's Now on Tap, and the security permissions need to be reworked.. Until MIUI 8 comes along (which should be by the end of September), your best bet to managing the clunky UI is to install a third-party launcher like Nova and a custom icon pack (I like Dives ).. The issues with the interface are skin-deep, and once you have a third-party launcher, things start to look much better. MIUI offers a ton of customization options, and you can easily spend an hour exploring all the settings. The OS is feature-rich as well, offering Child Mode, Guest Mode, and an App Lock service that lets you secure content behind a password. Don't want anyone prying into your images? Locking the gallery app will ensure that only you have access to it. If you don't want to key in a password all the time, you can also use the feature in conjunction with the fingerprint scanner. App Lock is accessible from the Security app (the shield icon at the top right corner).. The Redmi 3S is a compact device, but should you have difficulty reaching the length of the screen, MIUI's excellent one-handed mode is intact. The feature shrinks the screen size down to 4.0 inches or 3.5 inches, making the phone more manageable. All you need to do to enable one-handed mode is swipe left to right across the navigation buttons.. Xiaomi has put in a lot of effort to offer localize MIUI services, and that is evident with the Mi Remote app. The app works with the infrared sensor to control your AC, A/V unit, TV, and so much more. The feature in itself isn't noteworthy, but the number of devices the app is compatible with is staggering. To give you an idea of just how many brands are listed, it takes about six seconds to continually scroll through the list of TV manufacturers the app supports.. The Redmi 3S offers a rear 13MP camera with f/2.0 lens and PDAF. The camera produces decent images in bright conditions, although dynamic range is very limited. That's easily fixed by enabling HDR, but doing so leads to lengthy shooting and processing times. It takes a few seconds for a photo to save to the phone's gallery, and more often than not I found that the autofocus was too slow to dial in on a subject.. In low-light conditions, you'll find yourself shooting a series of photos in the hope that one of them turns out semi-decent. Lack of OIS and dual-tone LED flash means that you're better off shooting images during the day. After wasting an infuriating amount of time trying to get good images in low-light conditions, the best advice I can give is to not bother with the phone's camera at all when it's dark. Live in the moment, or something to that effect. These are the eight non-blurry photos I managed to take over the course of the review.. The front 5MP camera is also average, and the fixed-focus sensor lets you take wide-angle shots. It also "guesses" your age as soon as you line up your face in front of the camera. According to Xiaomi, I'm either 24 or 47 years old. The camera app offers a slew of features, including 36 beautify effects, ability to shoot in manual mode (don't bother with that one), and 12 filters with live previews.. Xiaomi Redmi 3S Bottom line. Shut up and take my money. Should you buy it? Definitely. With the Redmi 3S, you're getting a wonderful handset, and one of the very few budget phones that delivers on its promises. Featuring an excellent display, metal chassis, powerful hardware, and class-leading battery life, the Redmi 3S stands above all others in the entry-level segment, which is quite a feat considering the sub-₹10,000 category fields excellent products.. The camera isn't as good when compared to the rest of the handset, and you'll have to wait a while to get the much-improved MIUI 8 update. But those are minor niggles in what is an otherwise stellar product. Xiaomi produced a hit in the Redmi Note 3, and the Redmi 3S is a continuation of that success story.. The standard Redmi 3S at ₹6,999 is great in and of itself, but if you're looking for added storage, the convenience and added security of a fingerprint scanner as well as 3GB of RAM, the Redmi 3S Prime at ₹8,999 is an excellent proposition.. That said, the main competitor for the Redmi 3S is the Redmi Note 3, which is priced just ₹1,000 more at ₹9,999 for the model with 2GB of RAM and 16GB storage. The Redmi Note 3 has a 5.5-inch Full HD display, a beefier Snapdragon 650 SoC, a 16MP camera, and a 4000mAh battery. The variant with 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage costs ₹11,999.. Availability is also a factor, as the Redmi 3S is sold via weekly flash sales. Meanwhile, the Redmi Note 3 is available on general sale on Amazon and Flipkart. In the end, it comes down to what you want from a phone. If you're on a tight budget or are looking for a compact handset, the Redmi 3S is a better fit for you. Just know that you'll have to go through the rigmarole of flash sales to get your hands on one (at least for now). If you need a phone right now and don't mind spending an additional ₹3,000, then the Redmi Note 3 is highly recommended.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. posted by Luis D.. Android - Android + Xiaomi - Xiaomi +. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Camera A surprisingly good pair of cameras by low-end phone standards. A 13MP camera on a phone this affordable certainly sounds impressive, especially since it reads like a capable unit with its f/2.0 aperture, phase detection autofocus, and LED flash. While there's no 4K video recording, we take it it's still unrealistic to expect this feature from such affordable devices. Turning to the front, we get a 5MP selfie snapper with f/2.2 aperture and 1080p video recording, more than sufficient for selfies and video chat. We took the Redmi 3S out for a spin on a sunny day and returned with surprisingly good photos. No, they aren't outstanding, but the only gripes we got have to do with over-saturated colors and lack of fine detail. The automatic exposure and overall illumination of objects in the dark also leave something to be desired. But, objectively, all of these are minor shortcomings for an entry-level device. You can feel confident having this 13MP camera with you, and that's what matters. Video recording While 1080p resolution videos look good and crisp, the image stabilization is poor and the recorded sound is too aggressively filtered and unpleasant. There's no automatic autofocus, which means you'll have to tap manually, and getting objects in front of the camera in focus can take a while, potentially missing an important moment. If you aren't recording overly dynamic scenes and don't mind the hissy sound, the Redmi 3S can be a passable camcorder. Multimedia The Redmi 3S is adequate for video watching and music playback with its 5-inch display and reasonable, though still somewhat low headphone output. The bundled video and music players provide all the necesarry functionality, but little bells and whistles. You can realistically hold on to them before reaching for third-party alternatives.. Taking an HDR pic (sec) Lower is better. CamSpeed score Higher is better. CamSpeed score with flash Higher is better. Xiaomi Redmi 3s 720p Sample Video.

(Posts: 6747; Member since: 30 Sep 2014). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 23:32. they can't just give it 6.5 score without mentioning any better phone for that price.. (its base price is 140 EUR here, and won't reach $200 even with shipping fee and tax). and its have great battery life (last more than 50% longer than competitors). at least other site is still fair enough, lol. pcadvisor.co.uk - 4/5 "The best £120 you'll spend today".

Display : "An okay display whose resolution could have been higher" and here we have a 720p display on a 700$ phone which goes by the name of iPhone 6s. "And colour temperature warmer" while they mention in the very next para that there is a slider to adjust that. (Posts: 88; Member since: 26 Jun 2012). posted on 12 Aug 2016, 12:11.

Its a disgrace how biased the reviews on PA are. A 6.5??? Really??? 8 hours of SOT on your beloved Iphone is excellent, so what is 13 hours then? Also excellent? Wow. This is the king of budget phones for a 100 bucks. How come Samsung can make a "budget phone" for the same amount of money and the screen sucks, the performance sucks and battery sucks. You guys should really reinvent your scoring, because this makes no sense. And also it would not be a bad idea if you rename yourself to applefanarena. Then it would make more sense. If you're making reviews and you've already decided that it will suck cause it's not Apple or Samsung, why are you making it at all. It will be a feast to read your review of the upcoming Redmi 4, if you should dare to make one.. (Posts: 888; Member since: 22 Nov 2014). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 10:35. HD resolution for $120 is perfectly adequate. Snapdragon 430 doesn't suppoert DDR4 RAM. GPU performance is surprisingly decent, it's much better for games than Moto G4..

The review is not really fair at all. The device is truly a bang for buck no doubt about that. Even cons are not justifying the given score. They always point out non availability of device and take 2 points immediately. Of course it is a con but to really know the value of this device you have to buy it from where it is officially available. Otherwise it's like measuring the value of oxygen on a planet where people breathe nitrogen..

(Posts: 4589; Member since: 07 Mar 2012). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 12:02. True! Why are they complaining about the resolution?. Let's look back on a flagship of yesteryear, the note II.

I mean for a phone which is not belongs to Samsung or Apple, 6.5 would be the 8.5 of Samsung or Apple. We really should accept that the scoring scheme for PA is quite messy, I should give Redmi 3S a score of 5/7.. (Posts: 6794; Member since: 29 Mar 2012). posted on 11 Aug 2016, 21:52.

Worst review about the Redmi 3s that I've read so far. It contains false information and a wrong estimated price. The phone, actually, starts at 110 bucks (when in very special offer) up to 150 bucks (~normal price). The camera has autofocus (!) and it's pretty fast and da_n good for that price range! (100-150bucks) Additionaly, it has also hdr-sth.. (when there are light and dark zones on a picture. The hardware is better than a simple moto-g4!! Don't believe their stats, 430 sd processor and adreno 5 FTW!. And here you get a very good (!) fingerprint-scanner and an ir-sensor (universal remote control).

Xiaomi Redmi 3S has been launched in India at a price of Rs 6,999 and here's our first impression of the smartphone.. Technology Mobile & Tabs Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime launched: Here’s our first. Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime and Redmi 3S. have been launched at a starting price of Rs 6,999. Here is our quick review of the phone. Redmi 3S Prime looks like a smaller and pared-down version of the Redmi Note 3. The lack of a full HD display is a big disappointing on this phone. Updated: August 9, 2016 6:53 am. Sridevi funeral LIVE UPDATES: Mortal remains to arrive in Mumbai today Sridevi dies at 54, leaves India in shock This video of two Pakistani anchors 'fighting in a newsroom' has gone viral. Xiaomi ’s Redmi 3S Prime and Redmi 3S, the company’s next smartphones for India, have been launched at a price of Rs 8,999 and Rs 6,999 each. Xiaomi’s new Redmi 3S series is the company’s first fully Made-in India one and, according to the company, all of its units for these phones are made in the country, from the box to phone accessories.. Xiaomi Redmi 3S comes with 2GB RAM/16GB storage, while the Redmi 3S Prime has 3GB RAM and 32GB storage. The 2GB Redmi 3S doesn’t have a fingerprint scanner on the back, unlike the Redmi 3S Prime. Given the pricing, the Redmi 3S and its Prime version are a new offering in the budget segment from Xiaomi.. In terms of specifications, Redmi 3S and 3S Prime have a 5-inch HD display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 octa-core processor, 13 MP primary camera and a 5 MP secondary camera. Xiaomi Redmi 3S runs MIUI 7 based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and will come in Gold, Grey and Silver colour options. I’ve been using the Redmi 3S Prime, (the 3GB RAM version), and here’s my first impression of the phone.. If you look at the design of the Redmi 3S phones, you are reminded of the Redmi Note 3. It’s fair to say this is a pared-down version of the Redmi Note 3, with the smaller HD resolution display, the Snapdragon 430 processor. But Xiaomi has kept the metal unibody design as the same, and this price-point it is unusual to find a smartphone that looks so good. However the Redmi 3S Prime costs only Rs 1000 less than the 16GB version of the Note 3. Xiaomi now has smartphones in all price points: Rs 6,999, Rs 8,999, Rs 9,999 and Rs 11,999, and for a user it will be a tough choice to pick the one they need.. What is interesting is the battery in the Redmi 3S phones is slightly bigger than the one in Redmi Note 3 at 4100 mAh. I say interesting, because the phone is incredibly light when you hold it, and it doesn’t feel bulky at all. The battery size means this phone won’t die anytime soon. I have had this phone for five days, and now the battery has come to 11 per cent. This includes setting up the phone, downloading games, watching Netflix and some more. With Redmi 3S Prime, I would say the battery is an impressive USP, especially for cheaper Rs 6,999 version.. Xiaomi’s new phone has a more compact 5-inch display. Yes, the HD resolution feels underwhelming, given that I’m now used to bigger full HD display. I watched two Netflix episodes on this and I could feel the difference. But then again, it is still a very good display from Xiaomi.. On the overall performance front, the Redmi 3S Prime has so far proved to be more than adequate. Games like Asphalt 8 run smoothly on this, with no heating, and I’ve not yet faced any app crashes. But I’m going to spend some more time with the software and the phone, to see how it continues to perform.. The rear camera is 13MP, and I’ve not had a chance to use it in varied lighting conditions. However, the few shots I’ve taken in office are more than acceptable, much better than several other budget smartphones with their 13MP cameras. The camera is fast, with no shutter-lag, and focuses quickly.. Xiaomi has renewed its focus on India with smartphones launching in quick succession. 2016 in a way began with Redmi Note 3, followed by the premium Mi5, and phablet Mi Max. Now Redmi 3S and Redmi 3S Prime are here to shake up the budget segment. Also both are 4G VoLTE smartphone and will support band 5 in India, which is crucial for those looking to run their Reliance Jio 4G SIMs. I have still to use a Jio SIM on this, but will add more in my final review.. Xiaomi has also indicated it wants to bring more of its products to the country as it looks to expand beyond China. Whether we should expect TVs or Mi Water Purifiers to come here is still unknown, but no doubt India is getting maximum attention from the company. Xiaomi recently launched the Mi Notebook Air and Redmi Pro in China, although it doesn’t look like these products are headed here anytime soon.. Xiaomi Redmi 3S/3S Prime are a solid offering, and gives the company an extra boost in this highly competitive budget segment, which has also been Xiaomi’s core strength. Whether the addition of two new Redmi phones, helps Xiaomi dominate this segment remains to be seen..

If you have trouble capturing photos in bright sunlight or with high contrast, then the HDR mode is there to help you. The mode automatically captures three photos with different exposure settings and combine them to deliver detailed and richly colour snaps of your favourite things..

Enhance your selfies so that they truly stand out with the Beautify mode.
