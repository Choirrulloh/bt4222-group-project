The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better!

The Huawei P Smart is Chinese manufacturer Huawei’s latest budget smartphone. There’s a hint of the top end about this phone, though, with an 18:9-ratio, 5.65-inch screen, as well as a body crafted from a single block of aluminium.. The P Smart launched in the UK in February, where it’s available to purchase exclusively through Vodafone for £9 upfront on a 24-month contract, which start at £17 per month for unlimited texts, 250 minutes and 250GB of data, or £229 outright.. But is this handset worth your hard-earned cash? You betcha.. Taking a leaf out of Apple’s design book, the Huawei P Smart is crafted from a single sheet of aluminium – complete with a set of antenna lines on the rear à la the iPhone 6 and iPhone 7. The overall construction is solid and is capable of withstanding the odd knock and bump. I found, however, that the aluminium frame’s matte black coating is prone to chipping on the corners.. Don’t let that deter you, though. Paint chipping is an issue that most aluminium smartphones suffer from.. While the matte finish may look gorgeous and feel great it’s proved to be somewhat of a grease magnet during my two-week testing period, picking up residue from just about every surface I’ve placed the device placed on – and that drove me stir crazy. But that’s probably because I’m a clean freak. The front of the Huawei P Smart is headlined by a 5.65-inch IPS LCD screen. To be more specific, it’s an 18:9 panel like the one found on Samsung’s Galaxy S8 , which essentially means it’s been stretched horizontally. That’s good because it means you can fit even more on the screen than you would on a standard 16:9 screen.. Mounted above the screen is a standard speaker, which is clear but can be a little tinny when amplifying a call using the integrated speakerphone function. Also above the display is an 8-megapixel camera. I was especially impressed by the thinness of the bezel – the display occupies around 76% of the front of the unit and goes right up to the sides, leaving a little bit of space at the top and bottom.. Flip the device over and there’s centre-mounted fingerprint sensor. It’s about as responsive as you’d expect from a budget smartphone and can be used to wake the device from a deep sleep – something I’ve found myself missing a lot since switching back to my trusty Galaxy Note 8. In the upper-left corner you’ll find a dual-camera setup (13-megapixel plus 2-megapixel) and a powerful LED flash.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

On the bottom of the handset is a 3.5mm headphone jack, an antiquated Micro USB slot and a loudspeaker, which won’t be winning any awards for audio quality. The right is home to the power button and volume rocker – both of which are constructed from cheap plastic and make the most horrific, ear-wrenching sound when pressed – while the left houses the microSD/Micro SIM tray.. Truth be told, you’d have a tough time telling the difference between the budget Huawei P Smart and a flagship as far as build quality is concerned. It’s durable, surviving various drop tests from varying heights onto a wooden surface crack- and chip-free, and eye-catching with its 18:9 screen and dual-camera configuration.. The 5.65-inch IPS LCD screen on the Huawei P Smart is a lot better than that of most budget smartphones. It’s an ultra-tall 18:9 panel, which is a bonus in itself, with its HD+ resolution (1080 x 2160 pixels) constantly churning out rich text. Colours are vibrant, though feel superimposed at times – but that can be resolved by playing around with the colour temperature in the Settings menu.. I’m especially fond of the brightness of the display. It’s blindingly bright, so much so I doubt you’d struggle to use it in the middle of the Sahara Desert without an ounce of shade concealing the screen. Okay… Maybe that was a bit of an exaggeration. But it’s really good. That said, the viewing angles aren’t great, so you’ll need to make sure you’re holding it head on to benefit from the intensity of light.. Related: MWC 2018 – All the biggest news. Granted, it isn’t the best screen I’ve come across (I’d award that title to the stunning edge-to-edge Infinity Display on the Galaxy Note 8 or the iPhone X ), but it’s certainly fit for purpose. I often find it hard to describe what a screen is like and that’s because it’s, well, visual. But, the display here is much better than the majority of other phones at this price.. You’ll be pleased to hear that the P Smart ships running Android 8.0 Oreo , but disappointed to learn that Huawei has once again done away with the traditional Android interface in favour of its awful Emotion skin – despite receiving consistent criticism from consumers and the media alike.. I’m usually open-minded when it comes to modified user interfaces, but I had to scrap EMUI after 48 hours.. EMUI has come a long way since we reviewed the Huawei P8 Lite back in 2017. There’s now an option to enable the torch from Quick Settings, for example. But despite the firm’s best efforts, it still feels unpolished and extremely unnatural. It’s almost as if it took the stock build of Android 8.0 Oreo and reworked it, removing the traditional App Drawer, in a failed attempt to make it more like iOS.. The good news is that a quick visit to the Play Store to install an aftermarket launcher will restore some native Android goodness to the handset. After a week toying with the EMUI interface, I downloaded the official Google Now Launcher. The changes weren’t purely cosmetic, either. The unit felt a lot more responsive as a whole.. It would have been nice to see the P Smart included in Google’s Project Treble fast upgrade scheme, but we aren’t going to shoot this gift horse in the mouth. A budget handset leaving the factory running the latest flavour of Android is rare and, while we have no guarantee it will receive future whole number updates ( Android P , for example), the current build should see it through the next two to three years.. I often found myself having to figuratively pinch myself to remind me that the Huawei P Smart is a sub-£250 smartphone and not a £500 high-end titan. The Kirin 659 processor driving the handset is fast. It handled just about every task I threw its way with ease, remaining composed while switching between a handful of day-to-day applications and streaming a song from Spotify.. The only time I noticed a dip in performance was when I played Asphalt 8: Airborne, an intensive 3D game. It started off smooth, but as the unit started to warm up, it started to experience CPU throttling, consequently resulting in the frame rate dropping – and the unit slowing down as a whole. Force-closing the application and leaving the device to rest for a few minutes remedied the situation, however.. In typical Trusted fashion, I ran the P Smart through a Geekbench 4 simulation – a process designed to assess a phone’s performance. It scored 946 in the single-core and 3738 in the multi-core test, putting it on par with the almost two-year-old Galaxy Note 7. Although I was actually expecting it to rack up a few more points, as it feels a lot more responsive than Sammy’s former flagship.. Coming from a Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone X, I’m used to top-of-the-line performance – and I’m pleased to report that the P Smart does not disappoint, even if its Geekbench results tell a different story. It’s silky smooth in next to all real-world scenarios, and at a mere £229 left me wondering why I’m regularly shelling out north of £800 for flagship smartphones.. The Huawei P Smart’s dual-camera setup (13-megapixel plus 2-megapixel) is good, but it certainly isn’t going to be winning any awards.. Shots taken in daylight look crisp, but –. as we saw with the P8 Lite –. shots taken indoors or in low-light environments loose all clarity and detail. The same can be said for the 8-megapixel front-facing shooter, though it’s a little better when it comes to highlighting detail.. My biggest complaint when it comes to the P Smart’s camera isn’t that the hardware is subpar, but rather that the camera application misses the mark.. It’s extremely slow, taking between two to five seconds to capture an image after you hit the shutter button – when it works, that is. And it isn’t a fan of selective focusing, so you’ll have to rely on the mediocre Auto Mode to get the best shots.. The Huawei P Smart sports a 3000mAh cell. That isn’t large by today’s standards, but when paired with modest specifications, it’s enough to see the unit through at least a day of intermediate use. On average, I was unhooking the handset at 7:30 am and using it to scroll through social feeds, respond to messages and stream Spotify throughout the day and had 30% remaining when I plugged it in at 10pm.. My biggest qualm with the P Smart is that it doesn’t support fast charging. I was able to add 13% to the handset in half an hour using the standard charging apparatus. To that end, a full charge took around an hour and a half. That isn’t such a big deal, however. Just make sure you charge the unit every night and you shouldn’t need to plug it in during the day – I didn’t need to once during the testing period.. If you do find yourself running low on juice, you can take advantage of Android’s integrated Power Saving and Extreme Power Saving Mode to throttle processing power and harness background refreshing in a desperate plea to squeeze some additional life out of the battery. I didn’t need to use either of the tools on the P Smart, but I’ve taken advantage of them in the past and found they work surprisingly well.. If you’re in the market for a reliable smartphone that won’t break the bank, the Huawei P Smart is the perfect handset for you. I mean, what more could you want from a £230 smartphone?. But if you’re looking for something a little bit cheaper, the one-year-old Huawei P8 Lite is a fantastic alternative, priced at a measly £129.95 on Amazon. You can’t go wrong with either. There’s also the Moto G5 .. A fantastic budget smartphone that’s bound to impress.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

Huawei P Smart alleged pricing leaked online ahead of its launch. Huawei has an irregular naming strategy when it comes to launching smartphones outside China.. Published: Tuesday, January 2, 2018, 13:31 [IST]. Huawei has an irregular naming strategy when it comes to launching smartphones outside China. Just to recall the Chinese handset maker launched Mate 10 Lite in China and later launched it as Huawei Nova 2i in Malaysia. Similarly, the company unveiled Huawei Maimang 6 as Honor 9i in India. And just recently we heard news from a reliable tipster that Huawei Enjoy 7S which was launched last month would be rebranded as Huawei P Smart for consumers outside China.. While speculations are still going on about this case, the alleged price tag of the upcoming full-screen device Huawei P Smart has now been leaked online. According to reports or rumors as we would like to put it, Huawei will likely launch the smartphone in Germany before any other European countries. Furthermore, the rumor suggests that the device will come with a price tag of 249 euros (roughly Rs. However, the price seems to be on the higher side compared to the Chinese pricing of Huawei Enjoy 7S. Currently in China, the 3GB RAM/ 32GB storage variant is priced at CNY 1,499 (roughly Rs. 14,540) and the 4GB RAM/ 64GB storage variant is priced at CNY 1,699 (roughly Rs. Meanwhile, the handset is expected to be launched by the end of January. Apart from this, the manufacturer is yet to reveal the phone's itinerary as to which markets will get to the Huawei P Smart. But we might not have many things to expect from this device because as noted above it will be a rebranded version of Enjoy 7S.. As far as the specifications go, Huawei Enjoy 7S or Huawei P Smart as it will be called, most probably is coming with a 5.65-inch fullHD+ display having an 18:9 aspect ratio. The smartphone is powered by Huawei's in-house octa-core Kirin 659 processor running at 2.36 GHz. The device is available in two RAM and storage versions and it includes a 3GB RAM + 32GB of native storage variant and a 4GB of RAM + 64GB of native storage model. The internal storage can be expanded up to 256GB via microSD.. Talking about the cameras, the handset is equipped with dual 13MP+ 2MP rear cameras along with LED flash. Up front, there is an 8MP camera for selfies and video calls. The device is backed by a 3000mAh battery and it runs on Android 8.0 out of the box with Huawei's EMUI 8.0 skin on top.. The dual-SIM smartphone offers connectivity options like 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, and GLONASS. Sensors onboard include a Proximity sensor, Accelerometer, and Ambient light sensor. It measures 150.10 x 72.05 x 7.45 (height x width x thickness) and weigh 143.00 grams..

The Huawei P Smart is a smart choice if you're after an affordable handset with a big 18:9 display, but you can get better performance and photos elsewhere.. Smart looks at the right price. Huawei P Smart price and availability Out now in the UK Temporarily a Vodafone exclusive Key features 18:9 screen A good design Design Aluminium rear with plastic caps Low-surround design Slim at 7.5mm thick Screen Trendy 18:9 aspect ratio 1080 x 2160 resolution IPS LCD panel. The Huawei P Smart is part of a wave of new phones that seem similar to those released six months earlier but have an ultra-wide (or long) screen.. It's also very similar to the Honor 9 Lite , but has an aluminium back instead of a glass one.. It doesn't have an ultra-high spec camera or a killer chipset, but is a quality phone sold at the right price. You'll save a lot of money over a 2-year contract with a Huawei P Smart.. At the time of writing, Vodafone has a UK exclusive on the Huawei P Smart and it's not widely available in the US yet. Unusually, you can't buy it outright from Vodafone, just on a 2-year contract with a one-off charge of £9 and monthly fees from £17.. Compared to other Vodafone devices at the price, this makes the Huawei P Smart a killer deal. Competing picks are the Huawei P8 Lite and Vodafone Smart N8. The Huawei P Smart is better than either.. Looking wider, other alternatives include the Samsung Galaxy J5, a conspicuously lesser phone in some respects. The models we'd recommend considering too include the Moto G5S Plus and Honor 9 Lite.. The Huawei P Smart is a relatively low-cost phone, one that competes with models like the Moto G5S Plus and Honor 9 Lite.. Its most important feature is an 18:9 aspect ratio screen, which leaves less blank border above and below the display. You get more screen inch per inch of phone with this now-common design.. It also has a construction style that, like the Moto and Honor, isn't that easily distinguished from a more expensive phone.. The hardware inside is that of a low to mid-range device, though. It has an octa-core chipset without the blistering performance seen in more expensive rivals.. And while the Huawei P Smart has dual rear cameras, the 13MP and 2MP array won’t get you the image quality or level of background blur effect an iPhone X would.. However, almost every little compromise in the Huawei P Smart is easy to accept as long as you keep your expectations in line with the price.. The Huawei P Smart's job isn't to excite you like an iPhone X. It just needs to look and feel good enough to make spending 3-4 times the price seem silly.. Huawei has done a good job of dressing up what is at best a mid-range construction as something high-end. Let's deal with the back first.. The rectangle bordered by the two bright silvery strips is anodised aluminium. But above and below it, the end caps are plastic.. It's the kind of compromise you'll only notice if you go looking for it, but this makes the Honor P9 Lite a higher-end design than the Huawei P Smart. Its outer is all glass and aluminium.. The Huawei P Smart also has a mix of up-to-date and older hardware features. There's a very good fingerprint scanner on the back. It's significantly recessed, so you can't miss it, and works quickly.. However, the Huawei P Smart also has a micro USB charge socket rather than a USB-C. While the main real-world benefits are simply being able to plug it in either way around, and support for future USB accessories like headphones, it does seem dated at this point.. There's a headphone jack too, which some of you may well have traded a USB-C away for anyway.. The Huawei P Smart is not water resistant and doesn't trim down the screen surround as much as some recent, more expensive phones. But it's otherwise very easy to live with. The phone is narrower than a Moto G5S and is easy to handle. At 7.5mm thick it's also slim.. Very wide aspect screen phones like this make you reconsider what a 'big' screen size really is. The Huawei P Smart has a 5.65-inch screen but in handling terms the phone is similar to one with a 16:9 5.2-inch screen.. Its screen uses an IPS LCD panel with a resolution of 1080 x 2160, the same as just about all lower-cost 18:9 aspect phones. Color, contrast, sharpness and brightness are solid. For some reason a couple of apps seem to run at 720p, but that's the software's fault, not the screen.. Ultra-deep color is what you miss compared with a more expensive phone. Tones look fairly natural and well-saturated, but comparing the Huawei P Smart with the 'DCI P3' cinema mode of the recently reviewed HTC U11 Plus , the more expensive HTC's screen is richer still.. You can't fiddle with the Huawei P Smart's saturation or contrast, but there is a color temperature control. Different eyes will prefer different tweaks. We quite like the phone with a slight warm skew.. Next Page Battery life and camera. You can unsubscribe at any time and we'll never share your details without your permission..

FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Huawei P Smart with EMUI 8.0, FullView display launches on Vodafone UK. by Oliver Cragg 4 weeks ago. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. The Huawei P Smart is coming to the UK in partnership with Vodafone. The budget device, which is available on various contract plans or on Pay as you go for £229, is exclusive to the carrier until February 28th.. If the device looks familiar, that’s because it’s technically the Huawei Enjoy 7S that launched last December. It’s also Huawei’s latest phone to offer a “FullView” experience at a low price thanks to its 5.65-inch, 18:9 aspect ratio LCD display with a respectable 1080 x 2160 resolution.. Huawei P20 and P20 Plus: all the rumors in one place (Updated February 19). In this post, which will be updated regularly, we take a closer look at the latest rumors surrounding Huawei's upcoming P20 and P20 Plus smartphones.. Although the Huawei P10 and P10 Plus are great smartphones, they …. Also of note is the P Smart’s 13 MP and 2 MP rear dual-camera and its 8 MP selfie snapper. Both cameras get a boost from Huawei’s AI software which enable Bokeh effects, Face Beauty modes, and other algorithm-based features.. The UK model is powered by the Chinese giant’s octa-core Kirin 659 chipset backed by 3 GB of RAM, 32 GB internal storage (expandable up to 256 GB), and a 3,000 mAh battery. It also packs a 3.5mm headphone jack and has a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor.. As an added bonus, the P Smart runs the latest version of EMUI (8.0) out-of-the-box, making it one of the precious few Huawei devices that already takes advantage of Android 8.0 Oreo .. Contract prices for the P Smart start at £17 a month with a £9 upfront cost. That deal nets you 250 minutes, unlimited texts, and 250 MB of data. If you’re after more data, Vodafone is offering a 16 GB plan for just £29 a month (£9 upfront), which is usually the price you’d have to pay for 4 GB of data.. Do you like the look of the P Smart?

Reviews Huawei P Smart review. By admin - 02/19/2018. 6 0. Twitter Facebook Google+ Linkedin Pinterest Email. Huawei P Smart: Price Huawei P Smart: Features and design Cameras Software Battery life. Huawei traditionally goes for mid-to-high-end smartphones and leaves the more budget versions to its sub-brand Honor. With the P Smart, though, it’s now well into budget territory.. It has an 18:9 screen, a decent processor and dual rear cameras, plus the latest version of Android along with Huawei’s new EMUI 8.0 software.. You can only get the P Smart from Vodafone in the UK (it isn’t available in the US). Until the end of February it’s only available on contract, the cheapest being £17 per month with a £9 upfront cost.. That gives you a paltry 250MB of data, 250 minutes and unlimited texts. For 1GB and unlimited minutes you’ll be paying £23 per month, again with the £9 upfront cost of the handset.. The phone isn’t locked to Vodafone, but is only available in black even though Huawei produces a blue version of it.. If you did opt for the cheapest contract, it would cost you £417 over 24 months. Or, if you want 1GB of data, that brings the total to £561.. For comparison, you could get a 64GB Huawei P10 for around £350, then get a SIM-only deal for £10 per month, which would total £530 over two years.. You will be able to buy the P Smart outright, but it’ll cost you £299. In 2017, 18:9 screens were the new fashion but now it’s clear that you can have one even if your budget won’t stretch to even a mid-range phone such as the. Check the specs and you’ll note that the P Smart is pretty much just a slightly smaller, lower-spec version of the 7X.. Starting with the screen, it’s 5.65 inches across, with a 2160×1080 resolution. That gives it a decent pixel density of 428ppi, which means everything looks nice and sharp. Colours, contrast and brightness are all decent, too.. In the usual Huawei tradition, there’s a factory-applied screen protector to keep the display scratch-free, but there’s no case in the box. Instead you get some basic headphones along with a USB mains charger.. There’s a standard headphone socket on the bottom edge along with a mono speaker and a microUSB port.. The tall screen leaves no room for a fingerprint sensor, so that’s on the back. With many phones taking this approach, it’s becoming the norm and it’s easy to adapt: your finger falls naturally on the sensor when you pick up the phone.. Unlike the extremely similar Honor 9 Lite, the Huawei P Smart is a single-SIM phone rather than dual-SIM but it still has the slot for a microSD card to bolster the 32GB of on-board storage.. RAM is the same at 3GB and the processor is also identical: the Kirin 659. That chip is also used in the Honor 7X, so performance is – as you might expect – largely the same.. This means it’s no speed demon: expect to wait 4-5 seconds for the camera app to load and for there to be a delay when switching between apps. Once an app is running, however, performance is generally fine and you won’t notice any lag or sluggishness.. It’s the same for games: the P Smart will happily run games such as Pokémon GO smoothly with no jerkiness. You’ll never see high frame rates from benchmarks such as GFXBench’s Manhattan test, but that doesn’t mean it can’t run most games at an acceptable speed.. In terms of connectivity, you get GPS, Bluetooth 4.2, 802.11n Wi-Fi (just 2.4GHz single-band) and NFC.. Unsurprisingly at this price, there’s no water resistance.. The dual-camera setup is much like Honor’s: you get a 13Mp main shooter with a secondary 2Mp camera whose only function is to supply depth information: it’s not for taking photos.. It does mean that you can take portrait photos with blurred backgrounds, as well as a ‘wide aperture’ effect which does the same thing when you take landscape pictures.. Around the front there’s a single 8Mp camera: you don’t get the secondary front camera as you do on the Honor 9 Lite. So you can’t take depth-effect selfies on the P Smart. There is a Portait mode when using the front camera, but using it makes no noticeable difference!. Video capabilities are somewhat limited compared to more expensive phones. The maximum resolution is 1080p at 30fps and there’s no stabilisation to speak of.. It can track objects, but that’s about the only extra video feature you’ll find. Oddly, there’s a Pro Video mode that allows you to focus manually, choose the white balance and change exposure settings. We can’t imagine many owners using any of these options, though it’s always nice to have more control.. There’s no slo-mo, but you can select light painting (great for fireworks) and time-lapse. HDR is, sadly, also a dedicated mode and won’t be enabled automatically for photos.. In any case, the cameras aren’t wonderful. Selfies are perfectly acceptable, as are some shots from the rear camera in good light.. This photo shows it’s capable of good-looking images with great colours and reasonable sharpness.. However, zoom in on some photos and you’ll be disappointed at the lack of sharpness. This photo looks fine when zoomed out, but the tree and building are actually quite blurry.. At night, the camera does a decent job of keeping noise at bay: the sky is inky black. However, the lack of detail in the building means there is plenty of noise reduction going on.. Annoyingly, the depth effect doesn’t work on every shot you attempt. Out of five attempts, the P Smart only successfully blurred the background on one: the others had no bokeh at all.. Below is a crop of the image above, taken at dusk:. The video below is a good example of why you shouldn’t assume that just because a phone can record in ‘full HD’ its video isn’t necessarily sharp and detailed. Plus, footage is only usable if you keep the phone nice and still. Begin walking, and it becomes too shaky.. It’s good to see Android 8.0 Oreo, and we also happen to like Huawei’s EMUI 8 overlay. It won’t be to everyone’s tastes as it defaults to an iOS-style home screen. Hunt around in the settings though and you’ll find the option to enable the app drawer so you don’t have to keep all your apps across several home screens.. EMUI adds quite a few useful features, too. You can enable gestures such as double touch to turn the screen on or off and double-press volume down to launch the camera app. Then you can wave (or just hold up your palm) to automatically take a photo.. It also optimises memory use in various ways to keep Android running as smoothly as possible and offers lots of battery-saving options.. The Google Assistant is just a swipe away from the first home screen and you get a fantastic photo on the lock screen which changes each time you wake the phone.. The wider screen lends itself to split screen and you can use this to run two compatible apps side by side in landscape mode.. App twin is a feature we’ve seen on Huawei and Honor phones, and the P Smart gets it, albeit only for Facebook. It means you can sign into two different accounts on the phone at the same time.. The 3000mAh battery is fairly standard for a large-screen phone such as this. Huawei doesn’t quote any usage figures, but we found the P Smart would last a full day with normal use.. You’ll certainly be charging it every night, but unless you’re using GPS heavily or playing a lot of intensive games, you shouldn’t need to carry a power bank around with you for any top-ups..

Huawei P Smart Android Mid-Ranger Out In Europe This Month. January 2, 2018 - Written By Dominik Bosnjak. The Huawei P Smart Android mid-ranger will start retailing in Western Europe later this month, industry insider Roland Quandt reported last week, adding that the handset is set to debut with a price tag of €249, or approximately $299. The device is understood to be a rebranded version of the Huawei Enjoy 7S that debuted in China in mid-December and was already rumored in the context of a global launch. The handset was code-named “Figo” and previously identified as a. member of the “FIG-LXX” lineup which consisted of two devices, with the more premium one featuring 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal flash memory.. Consumers in Europe will only be able to purchase the base model of the Huawei Enjoy 7S, according to recent reports, with the Huawei P Smart supposedly packing 32GB of storage space and 3GB of RAM. Other specs remain unchanged across both models which feature a 5.65-inch display with an FHD+ resolution of 2,160 by 1,080 pixels taking advantage of an 18:9 aspect ratio. The tall image format and relatively small bezels allow the Chinese phone maker to deliver a smartphone that’s part of the phablet category while still being much more compact than traditional devices with 5.5-inch and larger screens. The Huawei P Smart is understood to be powered by the Kirin 659, the Same HiSilicon-made module found inside the popular Honor 7X manufactured by the firm’s subsidiary.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. A 3,000mAh battery is also said to be part of the package and while it won’t be removable, support for some quick charging technology seems likely. The rear camera of the Huawei P Smart consists of a 13-megapixel sensor supported by a 2-megapixel one, though the latter will presumably only be used for adding a somewhat natural bokeh effect to images as it isn’t capable enough to provide more direct support. The main imaging system of the device will also accommodate a regular LED flash, whereas its top bezel is rumored to house an 8-megapixel unit. Besides a microSD card slot, the Huawei P Smart will also boast Android 8.0 Oreo-based EMUI which it’s said to be running out of the box. The Chinese phone maker is rumored to launch the smartphone in black, blue, and gold color options.. Samsung’s Q4 2017 Profits Up 73% To $15 Billion: Report.

Home / SMART PHONES / Huawei P Smart review. Huawei P Smart: Features and design. Huawei traditionally goes for mid-to-high-end smartphones and leaves the more budget versions to its sub-brand Honor. With the P Smart, though, it’s now well into budget territory.. It has an 18:9 screen, a decent processor and dual rear cameras, plus the latest version of Android along with Huawei’s new EMUI 8.0 software.. You can only get the P Smart from Vodafone in the UK (it isn’t available in the US). Until the end of February it’s only available on contract, the cheapest being £17 per month with a £9 upfront cost.. That gives you a paltry 250MB of data, 250 minutes and unlimited texts. For 1GB and unlimited minutes you’ll be paying £23 per month, again with the £9 upfront cost of the handset.. The phone isn’t locked to Vodafone, but is only available in black even though Huawei produces a blue version of it.. If you did opt for the cheapest contract, it would cost you £417 over 24 months. Or, if you want 1GB of data, that brings the total to £561.. For comparison, you could get a 64GB Huawei P10 for around £350, then get a SIM-only deal for £10 per month, which would total £530 over two years.. You will be able to buy the P Smart outright, but it’ll cost you £299. In 2017, 18:9 screens were the new fashion but now it’s clear that you can have one even if your budget won’t stretch to even a mid-range phone such as the. Check the specs and you’ll note that the P Smart is pretty much just a slightly smaller, lower-spec version of the 7X.. Starting with the screen, it’s 5.65 inches across, with a 2160×1080 resolution. That gives it a decent pixel density of 428ppi, which means everything looks nice and sharp. Colours, contrast and brightness are all decent, too.. In the usual Huawei tradition, there’s a factory-applied screen protector to keep the display scratch-free, but there’s no case in the box. Instead you get some basic headphones along with a USB mains charger.. There’s a standard headphone socket on the bottom edge along with a mono speaker and a microUSB port.. The tall screen leaves no room for a fingerprint sensor, so that’s on the back. With many phones taking this approach, it’s becoming the norm and it’s easy to adapt: your finger falls naturally on the sensor when you pick up the phone.. Unlike the extremely similar Honor 9 Lite, the Huawei P Smart is a single-SIM phone rather than dual-SIM but it still has the slot for a microSD card to bolster the 32GB of on-board storage.. RAM is the same at 3GB and the processor is also identical: the Kirin 659. That chip is also used in the Honor 7X, so performance is – as you might expect – largely the same.. This means it’s no speed demon: expect to wait 4-5 seconds for the camera app to load and for there to be a delay when switching between apps. Once an app is running, however, performance is generally fine and you won’t notice any lag or sluggishness.. It’s the same for games: the P Smart will happily run games such as Pokémon GO smoothly with no jerkiness. You’ll never see high frame rates from benchmarks such as GFXBench’s Manhattan test, but that doesn’t mean it can’t run most games at an acceptable speed.. In terms of connectivity, you get GPS, Bluetooth 4.2, 802.11n Wi-Fi (just 2.4GHz single-band) and NFC.. Unsurprisingly at this price, there’s no water resistance.. The dual-camera setup is much like Honor’s: you get a 13Mp main shooter with a secondary 2Mp camera whose only function is to supply depth information: it’s not for taking photos.. It does mean that you can take portrait photos with blurred backgrounds, as well as a ‘wide aperture’ effect which does the same thing when you take landscape pictures.. Around the front there’s a single 8Mp camera: you don’t get the secondary front camera as you do on the Honor 9 Lite. So you can’t take depth-effect selfies on the P Smart. There is a Portait mode when using the front camera, but using it makes no noticeable difference!. Video capabilities are somewhat limited compared to more expensive phones. The maximum resolution is 1080p at 30fps and there’s no stabilisation to speak of.. It can track objects, but that’s about the only extra video feature you’ll find. Oddly, there’s a Pro Video mode that allows you to focus manually, choose the white balance and change exposure settings. We can’t imagine many owners using any of these options, though it’s always nice to have more control.. There’s no slo-mo, but you can select light painting (great for fireworks) and time-lapse. HDR is, sadly, also a dedicated mode and won’t be enabled automatically for photos.. In any case, the cameras aren’t wonderful. Selfies are perfectly acceptable, as are some shots from the rear camera in good light.. This photo shows it’s capable of good-looking images with great colours and reasonable sharpness.. However, zoom in on some photos and you’ll be disappointed at the lack of sharpness. This photo looks fine when zoomed out, but the tree and building are actually quite blurry.. At night, the camera does a decent job of keeping noise at bay: the sky is inky black. However, the lack of detail in the building means there is plenty of noise reduction going on.. Annoyingly, the depth effect doesn’t work on every shot you attempt. Out of five attempts, the P Smart only successfully blurred the background on one: the others had no bokeh at all.. Below is a crop of the image above, taken at dusk:. The video below is a good example of why you shouldn’t assume that just because a phone can record in ‘full HD’ its video isn’t necessarily sharp and detailed. Plus, footage is only usable if you keep the phone nice and still. Begin walking, and it becomes too shaky.. It’s good to see Android 8.0 Oreo, and we also happen to like Huawei’s EMUI 8 overlay. It won’t be to everyone’s tastes as it defaults to an iOS-style home screen. Hunt around in the settings though and you’ll find the option to enable the app drawer so you don’t have to keep all your apps across several home screens.. EMUI adds quite a few useful features, too. You can enable gestures such as double touch to turn the screen on or off and double-press volume down to launch the camera app. Then you can wave (or just hold up your palm) to automatically take a photo.. It also optimises memory use in various ways to keep Android running as smoothly as possible and offers lots of battery-saving options.. The Google Assistant is just a swipe away from the first home screen and you get a fantastic photo on the lock screen which changes each time you wake the phone.. The wider screen lends itself to split screen and you can use this to run two compatible apps side by side in landscape mode.. App twin is a feature we’ve seen on Huawei and Honor phones, and the P Smart gets it, albeit only for Facebook. It means you can sign into two different accounts on the phone at the same time.. The 3000mAh battery is fairly standard for a large-screen phone such as this. Huawei doesn’t quote any usage figures, but we found the P Smart would last a full day with normal use.. You’ll certainly be charging it every night, but unless you’re using GPS heavily or playing a lot of intensive games, you shouldn’t need to carry a power bank around with you for any top-ups..
