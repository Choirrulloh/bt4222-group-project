The Good The Meizu Pro 6's 10-core processor delivers speedy non-gaming performance, the phone has premium touches like USB-C and a fingerprint sensor and its sub $400 price is relatively cheap.. The Bad A jarring copycat iPhone design, poor gaming performance and awkward navigation that makes the Pro 6 clumsy to use.. The Bottom Line The Meizu Pro 6 packs impressive specs into a relatively cheap frame, but it loses key Android functionality in its attempt to look like an iPhone.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. One of these phones is not like the others.. The Meizu Pro 6 looks a lot like an iPhone .. The similarities can be hard to get over, but that's likely by design, given the energy the Chinese vendor has clearly put into making an iClone. And though it houses some respectable tech, the Pro 6 tries too hard to be an Apple product to really excel at being an Android.. The three main areas the Pro 6 is a let down are clumsy navigation, an operating system not fit for western users and, despite having a 10-core processor, surprisingly weak gaming capabilities.. The conspicuous absence of a return (back) button is perhaps most bothersome. With no button, you swipe across the home button panel to go back (or forward). You can also use "smart touch", which puts a small thumbstick on the screen which you can tap to go back, toggle side-to-side to navigate between apps, and so on. Both methods are functional but feel awkward. I never noticed how important the back button of an Android was until I didn't have one.. Meizu's customized software layer, FlyMe 5.6, is a modified version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. It's designed to look a lot like Apple's iOS operating system, with almost identical lock-screens and, as is typical of many Chinese phones, no app drawer -- that means that app icons spread out across multiple home screens. Unlike iOS, though, you can add widgets.. Meizu packs USB-C and other premium touches into this low(ish) cost Android (pictures). FlyMe works well, but is built for the Chinese market. Apps will push notifications in Chinese, even with English set as the default language. There's also no support for Google services, like the Google Play Store. All of this can be fixed by manually installing the Play Store and a custom launcher, but it's bad news for those who want a phone they can unbox and use right away.. One considerable downer is the phone's poor gaming performance. It scored low in our benchmark testing, and 3D games like Sonic Dash didn't feel completely smooth to play.. Meizu's new flagship isn't officially available in the US, UK or Australia, but you can buy it online. It comes in black, gold and silver variations, and retails in China for 2,499 yuan, which converts to roughly $385, AU$510 and £265.. Hot Products. The best iPhone asks you to think different.

Features: Pressure-sensitive, Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 3), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus (Phase detection, Laser). Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. 3840x2160 (4K) (30 fps), 1920x1080 (1080p HD), 1280x720 (720p HD) (100 fps). Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Deca-core, 2500 MHz, ARM Cortex-A72 and ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. posted by Stephen S.. 1 Introduction, Design and Display. 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. Introduction There's a certain contingent of smartphone users that, no matter which new handset you show them, will invariably comment, “Oh, that looks like an iPhone .” Sometimes that just reflects a narrow view of the smartphone market; it's only iPhone or iPhone wannabe, right? And sometimes there really are some pretty glaring similarities, as manufacturers try to take direction from moves where Apple has found success. But then there's Meizu with the new Pro 6 , where even “imitation” feels like too weak of a word: from hardware design, to functionality, to the heavily modified Android -based platform, the Pro 6 is a smartphone that feels like it was created from a singular vision intent on capturing some of that iPhone magic by following as close in Apple's footsteps as humanly possible. And wouldn't you know it, but the Meizu Pro 6 somewhat succeeds in doing just that. In the box: Meizu Pro 6 USB Type-C to standard A cable Fast charging adapter Warranty/safety cards Quick start guide SIM tool Design An iPhone by any other name... Back in March, much as we still are today, the smartphone community was speculating about the design of Apple's next iPhone. And when some imagery surfaced of a metal-backed handset with an interesting, curved antenna stripe, rumors quickly zeroed in on it being a possible iPhone 7 prototype. The next day, though, a Meizu exec burst our bubble by confirming that the image was actually of his company's own Pro 6. The initial leak didn't feel like a hoax, or an attempt by some jokester to pull one over on us; the Meizu Pro 6 really is that easy to mistake for an Apple device. Meizu's Apple-parroting decisions include giving the Pro 6 a single hardware button up front: a fingerprint-scanning home button that may not be round like Apple's but it's similarly all alone up there – no extra capacitive Android buttons waiting in the wings. And while Meizu does side-button placement a little differently, the phone 's bottom edge with headphone jack, mic, reversible USB Type-C connector, and speaker grille is one page pulled right from the iPhone playbook. Display A solid AMOLED screen with pressure-sensitive input Meizu gives its phone a Samsung -made 5.2-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 1080 x 1920. That sounds pretty good: an OLED-based panel from a manufacturer we trust, and one that doesn't try to win any pixel-density-meausring contests for bragging rights. With multiple color-tweaking modes to push that panel to its limits, as well as software options for adjusting white balance, the phone's screen sure comes equipped to impress. In our tests, though, it came up just a little short in terms of brightness, meaning you might be fighting to see this guy on a particularly sunny day. Like the iPhone from which it borrows so many tricks, the Pro 6's screen implements its own version of 3D Touch, letting you hard-press certain icons to pull up shortcuts. Honestly, it works really well, and our only big problem with it is how limited its availability is; only a few key Meizu apps take full advantage of these interactions.. 5.81 x 2.79 x 0.29 inches. 147.7 x 70.8 x 7.25 mm. 5.69 x 2.72 x 0.29 inches. 144.55 x 69.2 x 7.25 mm. 6.17 x 3.07 x 0.3 inches. 156.7 x 78 x 7.5 mm. 6.05 x 2.97 x 0.32 inches. 153.6 x 75.5 x 8.2 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Meizu Pro 6 Compare.

"If you do happen to live somewhere where the Pro 6 can take full advantage of the local carriers, the phone supports dual-SIM operation.". And if you don't it magically becomes single sim? Why is lack of US LTE support always a negative if it wasn't meant for the US market? That's like criticizing a US appliance for being 110V instead of 220V.

Android 6.0 with Meizu FlymeOS 5.2. Android 5.1 with Meizu FlymeOS 5.1. Meizu is hard at work carving out a niche for itself in its increasingly competitive home market. One of the smaller Chinese OEMs based on sales volume, it considers design and build quality as core strengths. Because of this attention to detail, and perhaps a ploy to increase perceived quality, Meizu’s phones generally carry a small price premium relative to its competitors.. Last year the company modified its branding to better differentiate its high-end PRO series from the mainstream MX series of phones. While a good idea, Meizu’s current product lineup still has no clear hierarchy. It currently offers three different phones in three different sizes that overlap in several key areas. The PRO 6 is Meizu’s current flagship, and while it holds a few advantages over the previous generation PRO 5 , which Meizu still sells, it also regresses in some ways. Then there’s the recently announced MX6 whose hardware and design is again similar to the PRO 6, but comes with a lower price.. Meizu historically sources SoCs from either MediaTek or Samsung. The PRO 5 comes with the Exynos 7420, the same SoC Samsung used in its Galaxy S6 family, but the newer PRO 6 uses MediaTek’s deca-core Helio X25, a frequency-bumped, Meizu-exclusive version of the Helio X20. The Helio X20/X25 are notable for being the first SoCs to use a tri-cluster CPU configuration , with two ARM Cortex-A72 CPUs to handle bursts of heavy activity, four lower-power Cortex-A53 CPUs to handle less intense, general workloads, and four more A53 CPUs at a lower frequency for very light loads and background tasks.. The problem is that the performance of the more expensive PRO 6 should be about the same as the mainstream MX6; its A72 cores peak at 2.5GHz versus 2.3GHz for the MX6, giving the PRO 6 only a theoretical 9% advantage—not enough to notice in everyday use—and the difference in frequency between the A53 cores is even smaller. The higher frequency A72 cores in both the PRO 6 and MX6 should give them a noticeable advantage over the PRO 5’s four A57 cores in single-threaded workloads—between 10% to 20% based on frequency plus the gains from architectural improvements—but this depends on how Meizu prioritizes the A72 cores. If the PRO 6 places more emphasis on reducing power consumption by placing more threads on the middle-tier A53 cluster instead of migrating them to the higher performance A72 cluster, then the PRO 6 could perform worse than the older PRO 5.. It’s natural to expect newer, higher-cost phones to have better gaming performance, but again this is not necessarily the case with Meizu’s current lineup. The MediaTek SoCs in both the PRO 6 and MX6 use the same ARM Mali-T880MP4 GPU, giving no clear performance advantage to the flagship PRO 6. Also, we’ve already seen the Mali-T760MP8 GPU in the older PRO 5 outperform the PRO 6’s GPU (the Huawei Mate 8 has the same GPU as the PRO 6).. The RAM and NAND specifications show a similar pattern. The cheaper MX6 comes with the same 4GB LPDDR3 RAM as the flagship PRO 6, while the PRO 5 comes with either 3GB or 4GB of faster LPDDR4 RAM. Both the PRO 6 and PRO 5 come in two different versions with either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage, but like the 32GB-only MX6, the PRO 6 uses eMMC 5.1 NAND instead of UFS 2.0 like the older PRO 5. And while the PRO 5 supports microSD cards for storage expansion, Meizu removed this capability from the PRO 6.. All three phones include a touch-based, capacitive fingerprint sensor using Meizu’s mTouch 2.1 technology; however, Meizu is using a different supplier for the PRO 6, sourcing its fingerprint sensor from GOODiX instead of Fingerprint Cards like it did for the PRO 5. Despite the change, the PRO 6’s sensor works just as well as the PRO 5’s, quickly unlocking the phone regardless of finger position or orientation. It handles mild changes in dampness and temperature as well as other capacitive sensors, but large changes in either render your finger unreadable.. The PRO 6 uses the same rear camera setup as the PRO 5: a 21MP Sony IMX230 Exmor RS sensor with a 6-element, f/2.2 aperture lens and a hybrid autofocus system combining laser, phase detection (PDAF), and traditional contrast detection methods. The PRO 5 generally captures nice looking images with this hardware. It will be interesting to see if Meizu improved its HDR processing for the PRO 6, a weak point for the PRO 5, and if there’s any change in image or video processing performance with the switch to the MediaTek SoC.. The PRO 6 is Meizu’s second-smallest phone with a 5.2-inch 1080p SAMOLED display. This is a big change from the PRO 5, which lands firmly in phablet territory with its 5.7-inch 1080p SAMOLED screen. The MX6, MX5, and M3 note all use 5.5-inch panels. Because of overlapping hardware specifications and similar designs, size and price end up being the most obvious differentiators among Meizu’s phones.. Even though the PRO 6 seems no better, or even worse, than the PRO 5 in some ways, it does add a couple new features. First, it supports USB 3.1 over its Type-C connector, although this feature is turned off by default. To get faster file transfers you’ll need to dive into the settings app and enable this feature, at which point you’re greeted with a warning about possible interference and compatibility issues. Indeed, after enabling USB 3.1, I was no longer able to transfer files with the Windows VM on my laptop, although everything still worked smoothly when connecting the PRO 6 to my Windows desktop.. The second new feature is 3D Press, Meizu’s version of Apple’s 3D Touch pressure-sensitive screen. Improving user interface navigation is a core focus of Meizu’s Flyme OS, and the new interactions 3D Press enables further this goal. We’ll discuss how well this works and whether or not it actually improves the user experience later in the review.. The Helio X25 SoC includes an integrated MediaTek baseband processor supporting Category 6 LTE speeds—up to 300 Mb/s down and 50 Mb/s up with 2x20 MHz carrier aggregation and 64-QAM on the downlink.. This is MediaTek’s first baseband processor with CDMA2000 support. The international version of the PRO 6 supports FDD-LTE/TD-LTE, TD-SCDMA, WCDMA, and GSM networks and 11 frequency bands, while the Chinese model adds CDMA2000 and supports 18 frequency bands. Despite repeated inquiries, I was unable to get specific frequencies from Meizu. The PRO 6 does not support North American LTE frequencies, though, limiting it to HSPA+ operation.. The card tray accepts two NanoSIM cards for Dual SIM Dual Standby (DSDS) operation, which means both SIMs are active for receiving calls or messages, but only one SIM can make a connection at a time. A dual-band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) Wi-Fi radio is also packed inside the Helio X25 SoC. It supports up to 802.11ac with a single spatial stream; however, the PRO 6 is unable to connect to my ASUS router using the 5GHz band. Switching to 802.11n over 2.4GHz works fine except it takes an unusually long time to make the initial connection after turning the radio on.. Over the next several pages, we’ll take a closer look at the PRO 6 and see just how well its hardware and software perform..

What is it about HTC 10 that you don't know yet? This to me is a much more interesting review, a different product. Besides, why don't you use Joshua's Twitter account to ask for an update instead of hijacking a different product's review section?. MrSpadge - Friday, August 26, 2016 - link. +1 I'm really getting tired of all those guys asking (demanding?) a review of some other product. As if the current one was not worth talking about. theduckofdeath - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link. I think it's fair to question a former great review site's inability to produce reviews lately. They do after all have comment sections to hear from the few readers they have left. Arnulf - Friday, August 26, 2016 - link. Notmyusualid - Saturday, August 27, 2016 - link. Hold on to your internet ladies! The guy is likely asking for the review, as Anandtech is THE place for smartphone reviews, and he is obviously interested in making said purchase. Not too difficult to understand, no?. jtang97 - Sunday, August 28, 2016 - link. The phone has been out for several months and still no review. Other newer phones have been released and reviewed and yet the HTC 10 review is still pending. How are people supposed to make in informed choice on which phone to get when Anandtech doesn't release one of the better phones of 2016. You've got all the benchmarks and photo/video comparisons and yet you still withhold releasing the review. Some people might start to think that you are paid to deliberately delay the review so that people will buy other phones instead of the HTC 10. it is perfectly reasonable to ask about the HTC 10 review each time a newer phone is reviewed. There should be no reason the HTC 10 review is delayed by 3 months and counting. Dennis Travis - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link. Where is the iPhone 3GS review? :D Grin I have been waiting for years for it! hahahahhaha. fanofanand - Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - link. Don't be silly, all Apple product reviews are copy and paste jobs from the last review. "Best ever, no reason to buy anything else" etc. Fidelator - Wednesday, September 14, 2016 - link. I agree completely, I seriously feel they got paid off, the 10 is quite honestly a far more important and relevant product than say, this(no offense to Meizu). And quite possibly one of very best phones released this year and here we are waiting for their review. Now just wait for the review talking about how great was Apple's choice on killing the 3.5mm jack. IanCutress : This guy's big mug on a wall @benwood https://t.co/8KavLs4a9W.

Meizu’s Pro 6 walks and talks like an iPhone, but it’s not a real flagship killer. Meizu’s Pro 6 looks slick and performs well, but it can’t beat competitors like OnePlus and ZTE.. Meizu’s Pro 6 looks slick and performs well, but it can’t beat competitors like OnePlus and ZTE.. Meizu’s Pro 6 looks slick and performs well, but it can’t beat competitors like OnePlus and ZTE.. Competition offers more for the same price. The Pro 6 looks like an iPhone. Flyme OS: the iOS of Android. Decent specs for $400, but no U.S. You’ll want to bring your charger. The camera is fine for the day-to-day. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. Meizu is at it once again with yet another reasonably priced phone that boasts relatively decent specs. This year, the company launched the Pro 6, the next installment in the ‘Pro’ lineup, which has always been about offering a solid experience without the premium price tag.. Last year’s Pro 5 was a decent phone, however it failed to live up to the hype, especially following the much-loved MX4 Pro , which was the ‘Pro’ version of the company’s flagship MX4. Does the Pro 6 redeem the Pro lineup and bring anything new to the table? We took the phone for a spin to find out.. Meizu is well known as an iPhone copycat in terms of both hardware and software. The Pro 6 is no different, but Meizu obviously tried to incorporate a few unique ideas into the phone in an attempt to distance itself from its bad reputation.. Let’s start with the obvious similarities – the Pro 6 features a full unibody aluminum body with rounded edges and curves like any iPhone out there. It also shows antenna lines along the back, which curve up towards the top and bottom of the phone, similar to the antenna lines on the iPhone 7. The camera on the back, unlike the iPhone, is centered and has an LED flash, which you’ll find directly below the lens.. On the right side of the phone, you’ll find both the power button and the volume rocker. The SIM tray is on the left side. On the bottom — unlike the iPhone — you’ll see a headphone jack, USB-C port, and speaker grill. Under the screen on the front, you’ll find the home button right where you’d expect. It doubles as a fingerprint sensor that’s very speedy to act, but not altogether accurate. It accurately detected my fingerprint around two thirds of the time. The rest of the time, I had to scan my finger again or enter my PIN code.. The Meizu Pro 6 may look like an iPhone, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing – the iPhone is known for its beautiful design, and copy or not, the Pro 6 is a beautiful device. It’s heavier than expected, but not in a bad way. It feels solid and looks premium.. Hardware isn’t the only design component to keep in mind – the design of the software continues Meizu’s iPhone copying tradition.. Copy or not, the Meizu Pro 6 is a beautiful device.. Not only does the overall look of Flyme – Meizu’s Android overlay – look like iOS, but it functions like iOS in some very interesting ways too. Most notably, Meizu has decided to continue pushing its 3D Press feature, which is more or less Meizu’s version of Apple’s 3D Touch. However, this feature is only supported by Meizu’s self-built apps at this point, probably because of the fact that Android doesn’t officially support a 3D Touch-like feature just yet, so there’s no incentive for third-party developers to incorporate the option unless they’re building specifically for a Meizu phone. It’s not really Meizu’s fault that no apps support 3D Press, but it would still be nice to see.. 3D Press works pretty much exactly the same way as 3D Touch, and does many of the same things. You just press down on home screen icons to quickly access features of a particular app. For example, press down on the Memos app, and you’ll be able to create a ‘New Memo,’ a ‘Photo Memo,’ and more. Press down on the camera app, and you can quickly start shooting a video or use the front-facing camera as a mirror.. Flyme OS, which is in version 5.2, actually comes with some very useful stock apps. For example, the Toolbox app includes shortcuts to do things like turn on the flashlight, check the ‘mirror’ (use the front-facing camera to check yourself out), use the phone as a ruler, and so on. The software also has a security app, which lets you do things like clean up unnecessary files, run an antivirus software, and more.. The operating system also includes a few handy shortcuts. For example, you can swipe up from the bottom of the display to access your recently used apps menu, and a button near the top of the screen will let you close all those apps at once. That’s pretty helpful, especially for those who tend to have a lot of apps open at a time.. First of all, we should point out that the Meizo Pro 6 doesn’t work on U.S. LTE bands, so it’s not an ideal phone for U.S. The phone supports the following bands:. HSDPA 850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100, LTE band 1(2100), 3(1800), 7(2600), 38(2600), 39(1900), 40(2300), 41(2500). With that in mind, we continue on with the specs and performance.. The Meizu Pro 6 isn’t as fast or powerful as the OnePlus 3 or the ZTE Axon 7.. Under the hood the phone features a MediaTek Helio X25 chipset, which is coupled with a cool 4GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of storage. Many will want to get the 64GB option, because the phone does not have a MicroSD card slot, so you won’t be able to add to that storage amount down the road.. The MediaTek Helio X25 isn’t a bad chipset by any means, and includes a fairly high-performance deca-core processor, which should help give it the edge over many other processors out there.. Before we jump into benchmarks, let’s talk about day to day use – in normal use, the phone runs very smoothly indeed. If you’re someone who wants a phone that can do things like make calls, text, browse social media, read emails, and so on, then this phone will be a great option regardless of benchmark results. The device really didn’t show any slowness when it came to things like opening and closing apps, however it did stutter a little in some more processor-heavy gaming situations.. Meizu Pro 6 Compared To. The Meizu Pro 6 scored 93,521 on AnTuTu, which is overall a pretty decent score. No, it’s not ground-breaking by any means, but it represents a very solid effort, especially on a sub-$400 handset. Sure, there are better phones out there, like the OnePlus 3 , which scored 140,288, and the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge , which scored 134,599, but overall the Pro 6 offers relatively decent performance, especially for the price.. Of course, real-world performance is also helped by the amount of RAM a device has, and with 4GB the Pro 6 is no slouch. Most flagship devices these days offer 4GB of RAM, except for the OnePlus 3, which goes a step further and offers 6GB of RAM. The Meizu Pro 6 isn’t as fast or powerful as the OnePlus 3 or the ZTE Axon 7 , which is a shame. It’s hard for Meizu to compete against those phones, especially since they’re in the same price range.. The Pro 6 packs a 5.2-inch Super AMOLED screen with a 1080p resolution, in the end boasting a pixel density of 423ppi. That’s not amazing, but it’s certainly not bad either – the resolution is slightly better than previous Meizu Pro devices, but that’s largely due to the fact that the device uses a 5.2-inch, not a 5.7-inch, display.. Images are clear, crisp, and look great, while the viewing angles on the device are really quite good. panels end up with a slightly pinkish tinge to them at higher brightness levels, but this one doesn’t seem to suffer from that problem at all. Even if it did, the Pro 6 lets you tinker with the color temperature of the display with a slider in the Settings app that goes between ‘warmer’ and ‘colder.’ There’s also a feature that goes into a night mode that pulls out the blues on the screen to help you get to sleep quicker.. For a phone that is supposed to offer flagship specs, you might be wondering why it has a 1080p display. That’s likely to keep costs down, but to be honest it doesn’t really matter. We didn’t ever find ourselves wishing we had a higher resolution display – under normal use, the display on the Pro 6 is more than adequate.. The Meizu Pro 6 has a battery capacity of 2,560mAh, which definitely leaves a little to be desired. While the battery life isn’t terrible, you’ll definitely need to charge it after a day of use, and if you’re a heavy user probably even sooner. Officially, the phone will last around 15 hours of 3G talking time and 10 hours of video playback.. The good news is that the Pro 6 is charged with a USB-C port, and does include fast charging, so if you have a few minutes during the day to charge your device you should get an extra few hours of use out of it.. With a 21-megapixel Sony IMX 230 sensor, at least on paper, the Meizu Pro 6’s camera is no slouch. The sensor boasts an f/2.2 aperture, phase detection and laser autofocus and a 10-LED flash, all of which help achieve some decent shots. The camera is capable of shots with a resolution of up to 5,312 x 3,984 pixels.. The camera is fine for the day-to-day, but you won’t see “Shot on Pro 6” ad campaigns any time soon.. The camera is interesting in a few ways: first of all, it uses a hybrid autofocus system using both phase detection and laser autofocus, which doesn’t just help keep photos nice and crisp, but it also helps improve low-light shots.. When you launch the camera app, by default, you’ll be in auto mode, however, you also have the option of switching to manual mode and a range of other modes in between.. The quality of photos offers by this camera certainly aren’t bad, but they’re nothing to write home about either. Sometimes, the camera will surprise you with a great shot, and other times you’ll be disappointed. Generally, the photos offer decent detail and dynamic range, but the shots aren’t going to blow your mind. Zoom in, even a little, and you’ll notice a fair bit of detail loss.. The camera also has HDR mode, which is aimed at offering a little more exposure, giving the shots a little more detail and light. Sometimes, this can be super helpful and seriously increase the quality of your shots. Be aware that your shots will have a somewhat unrealistic look to them – that’s not necessarily a bad thing, but the shots can look a little overexposed at times.. While a 10-LED flash sounds impressive, it really doesn’t offer much more light than what you would find on your iPhone or flagship Android device. That’s not a bad thing, but if you’re buying a phone specifically for its flash, you might be a little disappointed with the Pro 6.. The front-facing camera on the device boasts a 5-megapixel sensor, which is better than most. Again, this camera is fine for the day-to-day, but you won’t see any “Shot on Pro 6” campaigns any time soon.. Overall, the camera isn’t terrible, but it leaves a little to be desired. If you’re a photographer and want a phone to satisfy your needs, you should probably keep looking.. The Pro 6 comes with Meizu’s one-year warranty, which extends to defective units – you won’t get a replacement if you drop your device into the bath or if some disaster happens and your phone breaks.. Of course, you may be able to get a more comprehensive warranty plan through the retailer or carrier you buy your phone from – just keep in mind that it won’t be through Meizu.. The Meizu Pro 6 isn’t perfect, but for less than $400, it’s a decent nice phone. It would be nice to see a slightly better camera and a better battery, but for 2,499 yuan, which equates to around $375, it has a lot to offer.. If you wish you could get an iPhone but don’t have the cash, or if you like Apple’s design sensibilities but want Android on your phone, the Pro 6 is an excellent choice.. Of course, that doesn’t mean it’s the best choice. In fact, for about $25 more, you could get the OnePlus 3, which boasts a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, a massive 6GB of RAM, and a far better camera. There’s also the gorgeous ZTE Axon 7, which costs $400, has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip, 4GB RAM, and a strong camera. Our recommendation is that if you’re looking for a flagship device with a $400 price tag, check out the OnePlus 3 or the ZTE Axon 7.. Both of these devices are more readily available to U.S. buyers than Meizu’s phones, which you’ll have to buy through sites like Amazon and GearBest. On Amazon, you’ll pay just over $400, but on GearBest, it’s a slightly better deal at $340.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

Meizu Pro 6 review Another great effort that manages to impress in key areas. by Krystal Lora June 15, 2016. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. -USB Type C and fast charging. -Flyme OS will take some getting used to. The Meizu Pro 6 offers a mixed bag when it comes to a great smartphone experience. The device gets a lot right, such as the build quality, the display features, an extremely fast and accurate fingerprint scanner, and a great sounding speaker. However, a mediocre camera and average battery life may be deal breakers for some.. Processor 2.5 GHz deca-core Helio X25 processor. Camera 21 MP rear camera, f/2.2 aperture, laser auto focus, 10 LED flash. 5 MP front-facing camera, f/2.0 aperture. USB Type C 1.0 (USB v3.1). Software Flyme OS based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Dimensions 147.7 x 70.8 x 7.3 mm. Meizu is well known for their mid-range and entry-level smartphones that are surprisingly low-cost, but the Chinese OEM does have some solid high-end phones on offer as well, that continue to be priced quite aggressively.. For Meizu, these high-end devices are seen in the form of “Pro” iterations of their base “MX” flagships. This time around however, the company seems to have done away with the MX line altogether, by jumping directly into the releasing the latest Pro edition smartphone.. What does this device bring to the table? We find out, in this comprehensive Meizu Pro 6 review!. As has been the case with previous Meizu smartphones, the inspiration in terms of design is quite obvious at first glance. However, with the Pro 6, Meizu attempts to do things a little bit different and includes a few unique design elements, that allows for some separation from the design of the iPhone, and previous generation Meizu smartphones as well.. The Pro 6 does come with a full metal unibody construction, with the aluminium used appearing to be of a higher quality grade. There are no sharp or flat edges on this phone, with the back curving in along the sides to meet the front. The antenna bands appear at the top and bottom on the back as well, but with a unique look that certainly hasn’t been seen before. The rear camera is actually HTC 10 -esque in its appearance, below which can be found a 10 LED flash.. The volume rocker and power button are on the right side, and at the bottom is the headphone jack, USB Type C charging port, and single speaker unit, in a design that will be extremely familiar. In fact, the overall design of the Meizu Pro 6 will be rather recognizable, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Helping the well known design language is a high quality build that allows for the device to feel fantastic in the hand, and design is an aspect that most will consider to be a positive.. Unlike previous Pro iterations that featured large 5.7-inch displays, the Pro 6 features a 5.2-inch screen, that allows for a more manageable handling experience, and the AMOLED display comes with a Full HD resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 424 ppi.. This display offers everything you’d expect to see from a high quality AMOLED screen, including vibrant, saturated colors, and deep, inky blacks. While some AMOLED displays tend to have a pinkish tinge when setting the display at the lowest brightness level, that doesn’t seem to be the case here either. It may not boast the highest resolution or pixel density when compared to its flagship brethren, but 1080p is more than enough at this screen size, and the display of Pro 6 proves to be quite impressive.. The display comes with a few interesting software and hardware features as well. On the software side, these features include eye protection, which results in an orange hue to help avoid the harmful effects of blue light, and is especially useful when you are trying to sleep. You can also manually change the color temperature of the display, and there are also various display modes that let you adjust the level of color saturation on this display.. However, the new addition, that will also result in more comparisons with the iPhone, is the availability of Meizu’s take on 3D Touch, called Force Touch. If you’ve used 3D Touch on an iPhone before, you will find the experience to be largely similar here. A force press will display different shortcuts, like video mode or selfie mode with the camera, and there is also a peek and pop gesture, where a bit of pressure will bring up a a preview of an image, and adding more force makes the image larger and larger, until it becomes a full size. Unfortunately, the number of third-party Android apps that support Force Touch is extremely limited, so for now, you are restricted to using these with Meizu’s apps only.. Under the hood, the Meizu Pro 6 comes with a deca-core MediaTek MT6797T Helio X25 processor, clocked at 2.5 GHz, and backed by the Mali-T880MP4 GPU, and 4 GB of RAM. You can see the benchmark scores in the screenshots below, but as far as real world performance is concerned, the device handled everything very well.. The Pro 6 didn’t really slow down in any instance, and everything from opening, closing, and switching apps, to all other everyday tasks is smooth and snappy for the most part. There are some issues as far as gaming is concerned though, with load times being a touch slow, and a few instances of lag and stutter seen when playing processor-intensive games.. 32 GB or 64 GB are the in-built storage options available with the Meizu Pro 6, but users with storage concerns will have to opt for the higher version, with the device not coming with expandable storage. You do get dual SIM capabilities here, which can be useful for some, depending on the market.. Below the display is a lone home button that also doubles as a fingerprint scanner. The performance of the scanner was actually very surprising, and is one of the fastest we’ve seen on a smartphone so far. Granted, you do need to press the home button and turn the screen on before the device can be unlocked, but when the screen is on, just a tap of the home button is enough to unlock the device. Of course, the sensor is very reliable as well but it doesn’t quite compare to other smartphone fingerprint sensors that allow you to unlock your phone without waking the phone first.. There are no on-screen of capacitive navigation keys to be found on this device, and Meizu has quite an unique implementation in place. The back button functionality is actually a part of the home button as well. While a press of the home button works as expected, a simple tap on it will work as a back key. This can take some getting used to, especially when considering that the majority of Android smartphones has a dedicated back and Recent Apps key, but is a nice way to keep the front of the device clean, and avoids using up any additional display real estate.. As far as the Recent Apps page is concerned, this can be opened by a swipe up from the bottom of the display. The app you are currently using will slowly shrink as the Recent Apps list comes up, with a good looking animation, and this works really well, for the most part. It can be a touch frustrating to trigger this action, with only a slow and steady swipe up guaranteeing a result every time, and this can get quite annoying for users who switch between apps often.. The single speaker unit sits at the bottom of the device, and as is always the case, this isn’t the best position for a speaker. Not only is the sound going away from you when watching videos or listening to music, but the speaker is also easy to cover up when holding the device in the landscape orientation. However, Meizu does manage to impress when it comes to audio quality. The sound is clear and loud, and the speaker delivers a good amount of bass as well, and this is easily one of the best bottom-mounted speakers we’ve seen on Android smartphone thus far.. The Meizu Pro 6 comes with a rather small 2,560 mAh non-removable battery, but the battery life is still quite good. You will get around 3 hours and 45 minutes of screen-on time with moderate usage, and for the most part, that may be enough to get you comfortably through a full day of use. Depending on your usage, you may find yourself needing to recharge the phone half way through your day, but the good news is that the Pro 6 does come with a USB Type C port (USB 3.1) and some form of fast charging capabilities, that will allow you to be up and running in no time.. The Meizu Pro 6 comes with a 21 MP rear camera, with a f/2.2 aperture, a laser-guided auto focus system, and a 10 LED dual tone flash, along with a 5 MP front-facing camera with a f/2.0 aperture. There is no optical image stabilization here however, which is quite disappointing to see.. 21 MP does allow for you to zoom in a lot into shots and crop in a good amount, but unfortunately, images don’t appear very sharp, with a lot of detail being lost as well. There is some noise to be seen, even in well-lit conditions, and the color reproduction is lacking as well. The camera is capable of taking some decent shots, but the lack of color is noticeable no matter what. HDR does help a lot in some situations, but sometimes that is often to a point where the shot begins to look unrealistic.. Image quality is definitely a mixed bag when it comes to this camera. The usual issues crop up when taking pictures in low-light conditions, with the loss of a lot of detail, colors being even more lackluster, and the overall image being generally dark and noisy. HDR is also hit and miss in poorly-lit situations. Sometimes, it will brighten the image just enough to create a good shot, but at other times, it will brighten the image way too much, which does bring out more detail in the shadows, but also results in overblown highlights.. You can shoot 4K video with the Pro 6, and while the video quality is decent for the most part, the lack of OIS is very noticeable here, making for some very shaky videos. The camera also sometimes struggles when it comes to focusing on objects when shooting video as well.. The 5 MP front-facing camera has a larger pixel size than most, in order to capture more light, but selfies are also below average. In brightly-lit outdoor situations, you can get a decent selfie, even though the image will often end up quite soft, and with some amount of noise. If you’re taking a selfie in anything other than well-lit conditions however, the images will turn out to be very blurry, or with lots of distracting noise.. On the software side of things, the Meizu Pro 6 is running the latest version of the Flyme OS, based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Past iterations of the Meizu’s custom OS weren’t the best, but the company has been making some useful changes the help make the user experience a lot better.. There’s still no app drawer available though, leaving users dependent of creating folders to keep things organized. Some of the changes include the Recent Apps screen that can be opened with a swipe up from the bottom of the display, and comes with a cool animation and is presented in a nice layout. The pull down menu isn’t divided into two sections anymore, with the quick toggles and notifications all housed in a single page. Finally, Meizu has also added a Settings icon and shortcut at the top of the notification drop down, something that was surprisingly missing from previous iterations of the Flyme OS.. There are some nice features baked in as well, such as a slew of gesture controls, that include double to wake, a gesture input to pull down the notification shade, and up to eight different letter inputs that can be assigned to bring up specific applications. The Flyme OS offers a very different take on Android than what you may be used to, but different doesn’t have to mean bad, and it certainly doesn’t in the case of the Meizu Pro 6.. So there you have it for this in-depth look at the Meizu Pro 6! The latest flagship Meizu managed to impress in more ways than one, and while there may not be anything unique to help this device stand out from the crowd, it does really well with the features it does have to offer. The fingerprint scanner is fast, and while the placement of the bottom-mounted speaker isn’t ideal, the audio quality is surprisingly good. Meizu has also managed to clean up their software experience to some extent, and while it will still take some getting used to, the additional features end up being quite useful.. That said, the camera isn’t particularly impressive, which can be a deal breaker for a lot of users. The Pro 6 isn’t the most affordable when importing the device to the US, but in markets where the phone is officially available, what you do get is a solid smartphone that proves to be dependable for the most part..

The Meizu PRO 5 is a smartphone designed and produced by the Chinese manufacturer Meizu , which runs on Flyme OS, Meizu’s modified Android operating system. It is the company's first model of the flagship PRO series. It was unveiled on September 23, 2015 in Beijing.. 2.2 Hardware and design. First rumors about Meizu releasing a new flagship device featuring a Samsung Exynos SoC appeared in September 2015, after the device was listed on the AnTuTu benchmark, It was also mentioned that the upcoming flagship device would be called “Niux”. On September 9, 2015, Meizu officially announced that it would release a new flagship device on September 23, 2015. On September 11, 2015, Meizu VP Li Nan announced that the name of the new flagship device will be PRO 5. Pre-orders for the PRO 5 began after the launch event on September 23, 2015. The release of the device was delayed until November due to flooding of the factory. The Meizu PRO 5 was released with an updated version of Flyme OS, a modified operating system based on Android Lollipop. It features an alternative, flat design and improved one-handed usability.. The Meizu PRO 5 features a Samsung Exynos 7420 Octa with an array of eight ARM Cortex CPU cores, an ARM Mali-T760 MP8 GPU and 3 GB or 4 GB of RAM , which scores a result of 85,652 points on the AnTuTu benchmark. [7] The PRO 5 was ranked first on the AnTuTu benchmark rating for Q3 2015. [8] Meizu Global Brand Manager Ard Boudeling explained in November 2015 that Meizu decided to use the Samsung Exynos SoC because it is “currently [..] the only option if you want to build a genuine premium device”. The Meizu PRO 5 has a full-metal body, which measures 156.7. It has a slate form factor , being rectangular with rounded corners and has only one central physical button at the front. Unlike most other Android smartphones, the PRO 5 doesn’t have capacitive buttons nor on-screen buttons. The functionality of these keys is implemented using a technology called mBack, which makes use of gestures with the physical button. This button also includes a fingerprint sensor called mTouch.. The PRO 5 is available in four different color variants (grey body with black front, champagne gold body with white front and white body with black or white front) and comes with 32 GB or 64 GB of internal storage.. The PRO 5 features a 5.7-inch AMOLED multi-touch capacitive touchscreen display with a ( FHD resolution of 1080 by 1920 pixels. The pixel density of the display is 387 ppi.. In addition to the touchscreen input and the front key, the device has a volume/zoom control and the power/lock button on the right side and a 3.5mm TRS audio jack , which is powered by a dedicated Hi-Fi amplifier supporting 32-bit audio with a frequency range of up to 192. The PRO 5 uses a USB-C connector for both data connectivity and charging.. The Meizu PRO 5 has two cameras. The rear camera has a resolution of 21.16 MP , a ƒ/2.2 aperture and a 6-element lens. Furthermore, the phase-detection autofocus of the rear camera is laser-supported. The front camera has a resolution of 5 MP , a ƒ/2.0 aperture and a 5-element lens.. The PRO 5 received mostly favorable reviews.. Android Authority gave an overall rating of 8.8 out of 10 points, concluding that the PRO 5 “is easily the best flagship Meizu has released to date [..] and should certainly not be overlooked”. Android Headlines noted that it “is significantly more affordable than other similarly specced offerings out there”, concluding that the “Meizu PRO 5 is one of the best devices [..] reviewed to date”. ^ "Meizu PRO 5 website". ^ "Meizu PRO 5 - Full phone specifications". ^ "Meizu 'NIUX' Pops Up On AnTuTu, Exynos 7420 In Tow". ^ "Meizu's New Flagship Will Launch On September 23rd". ^ "Meizu's VP: New Flagship Will Be Called Meizu Pro 5". ^ Gadgets 360 (October 9, 2015).

May 16, 2016 - Written By Alexander Maxham. In the west, Meizu may not be the most popular Chinese manufacturer, but they definitely put out some great products. Typically when you think of a Chinese manufacturer, the names that come to mind are Xiaomi, ZTE, Huawei and Lenovo (Moto now too). Meizu has been around for quite a while, actually, but really only started to see growth in the past year or so. In 2014, the company sold 4.4 million smartphones. Now in 2015 that number rose to about 20 million. Making for a pretty impressive year-over-year increase. In 2016, they have announced the Meizu M3 Note which is a somewhat mid-range device with a very low-end price. 6, which is what we are here to talk about today.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. When the Meizu PRO 6 was announced last month, many enthusiasts saw it as a step down from the PRO 5 that the company announced in 2015. They swapped out an Exynos chip for MediaTek’s Helio X25, they also dropped the screen size and battery, but kept the same camera. This leads many of us wondering, is the Meizu PRO 6 worth the money? Well let’s find out in our review of the Meizu PRO 6.. Inside the Meizu PRO 6, we have the MediaTek Helio X25 processor, which is a deca-core processor. a dual-core 2.5GHz Cortex-A72, combined with a quad-core 2GHz Cortex-A53 and a quad-core 1.4GHz Cortex-A53 set of cores, which make up for what looks like a powerful processor on paper. We also have the Mali-T880 GPU inside. That’s combined with 4GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of storage. It is not expandable, so you’re stuck with the included storage. Powering all of that is a 2560mAh battery.. The display on the PRO 6 is pretty respectable. It’s a 5.2-inch 1920×1080 resolution Super AMOLED display. Which brings it to about 423 pixels per inch. It’s running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, along with Meizu’s own UI known as Flyme v5.2. Camera-wise, we have a 21MP f/2.2 sensor around back with phase detection and laser auto-focus. But what is unique about this camera is the ten-LED flash, which is a dual-tone flash. The front has a 5MP f/2.0 camera that is capable of 1080p video.. Lastly, the bands supported by the Meizu PRO 6 are listed below.. LTE Band 1 (2100), 3 (1800), 7 (2600), 38 (2600), 39 (1900), 40 (2300), and 41 (2500). Surprisingly, the packaging for the Meizu PRO 6 was quite interesting. Typically the box for most smartphones is cardboard. However the PRO 6 had a plastic box, which is a bit more durable and made for a. unique experience, to say the least. Inside we of course have the Meizu PRO 6 along with a USB Type-A to Type-C cable and a wall adapter (our model came with the EU adapter since it is the worldwide model and not the Chinese model). There is also a SIM ejection tool and a bunch of paperwork telling you how to use the phone, use the SIM card tray and much more.. Just looking at the spec sheet, you’d expect this display to be amazing. It’s a 5.2-inch 1080p Super AMOLED display. Since it’s a smaller display, the PPI is still fairly high, coming in at 423. Like many other Super AMOLED displays, the PRO 6’s display can get very dim. This is especially good for using the phone at night. On the flip side, though, it can also get very bright. Making it perfect for using outdoors in direct sunlight. Meizu does also allow you to adjust the display. So there are four different display modes available which include Adaptive Mode, Standard Mode, Photo Mode and Colorful mode. Additionally, the display mode will automatically optimize the display color range, saturation, and sharpness. This way you get the best-looking display possible, no matter the environment you are in. Some people like warmer displays, some like cooler ones. Meizu also gives you the option to adjust that to your preference. During my time with the Meizu PRO 6, I kept it at the default setting, as I found that worked the best for me. Much like the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, the PRO 6 also has an Eye-Protection Mode. What this does is it protects your eyes from harmful blue lights for long-time use. This is especially important if you like to read at night, or in the dark.. As mentioned the display does get very bright, and it doesn’t seem to affect the battery all that much. We also have to remember that this display isn’t using as many pixels as say. the Samsung Galaxy S7 or even the Xiaomi Mi 5. So battery won’t take that much of a hit, with the brightness being all the way turned up. Colors are very vivid here on the PRO 6. We’ve been using all sorts of very colorful wallpapers on this smartphone, and they all look incredible. Of course, this is a Super AMOLED display, so that’s expected.. This is a high-end smartphone from Meizu, so there shouldn’t be any issues with the digitizer, and there definitely aren’t any here. We’ve been using the PRO 6 for almost two weeks and haven’t had a single issue with the digitizer inside the phone. You don’t need to press the screen hard, either to get it to work.. However, this is a pressure sensitive display. Although I have to say the branding here is pretty inconsistent. Some places it’s called Force Touch, others it’s 3D Press and then it’s also called mPress. It does work a whole lot like the Force Touch on the iPhone, where you can press harder on different apps and even pictures in the Gallery to see them without opening them up. It’s a cool feature, but it’s not one we used terribly often.. As soon as you lay your eyes on the Meizu PRO 6, you’ll realize that it looks a whole lot like another smartphone. A smartphone from a certain company in Cupertino, California. It’s hard to deny that the Meizu PRO 6 doesn’t look like the iPhone 6S, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Sure, OEM’s should have their own unique design. But the design here isn’t bad at all. In fact, I’d say they took the iPhone design and made it better. Just look at the antenna lines on the back. They are still there, and will be until a company figures out a way to get rid of them (without painting the metal on the backside). But they are more minimal, and I quite like them actually. There’s also less bezel on the front of the PRO 6, compared to the iPhone, especially on the left and right sides. So does it look like an iPhone? Yes. Is that a bad thing? Not really.. The Meizu PRO 6 is made of metal and glass which makes for a great feeling smartphone in the hand. My only real issue with the PRO 6, as far as how it feels in the hand, is that it’s a bit tall. It would be nice to have it a few millimeters wider and a few millimeters shorter. The bottom of the PRO 6 is quite busy, we have our 3.5mm headphone jack on the left side, next to a microphone port, with the USB Type-C port in the middle and a speaker on the right side. So Meizu didn’t do like HTC and use the earpiece as a speaker as well. It’s great that Meizu kept with USB Type-C (after all the PRO 5 had Type-C too), and it’s great to see it going more mainstream. USB Type-C is a great port to use because it truly is universal.. The front of the device is pretty minimal really. There’s a home button at the bottom of the display, and at the top we have the earpiece, your cluster of sensors (like the proximity sensor) and then the front-facing camera. Now the chin and forehead are a bit bigger than we’d like, but we aren’t engineers, so we’re not sure how much they could cut it down, really. It’s a nice clean front, on the gold model we have here (a white front). It’ll likely look even cleaner with the black front, since the proximity sensor and front-facing camera will blend in with the black bezel a bit more.. Lately, we’ve seen many smartphones going the way of using the SIM card tray for a microSD card slot and SIM card slot. Meizu has actually done this with a few of their smartphones. But that’s not the case here with the PRO 6. We’re looking at a dual nano SIM card slot. It blends in pretty well on the left side, but you can still tell there is a SIM card slot there.. Meizu was one of the first to put fingerprint sensors on their smartphones (not the first though), and a few years later, the PRO 6’s fingerprint sensor is pretty darn good. Meizu uses a home button on the front, which is the only button you’ll use to interact with the device. The home button is a fingerprint scanner, but it is also your back button. And of course getting to recents is just a gesture away. It’s a unique way to do things in their Flyme UI, and I actually like it. It doesn’t even take that long to get used to it, which is also nice.. Onto the important part of any fingerprint sensor, and that is, how well does it work? It’s lightning quick, and for the most part, it does recognize my fingerprint every time I attempt to unlock the device. There are a few times that it has issues scanning my finger, but I’d say around 98 times out of 100, it’s spot on. The sensor is a bit smaller than the one on the LG G5, and even the Samsung Galaxy S7, which likely contributes to the very rare times it doesn’t recognize your fingerprint.. As mentioned already, the PRO 6 does have Android 6.0 inside. What this means for fingerprint sensors is that they are a whole lot more useful. There are a handful of apps that I use that support Android’s Fingerprint API. Apps like LastPass, PayPal, Bank of America and a few others. LastPass is especially useful for having fingerprint support, since it is a password manager. And on the PRO 6, you are able to login with your fingerprint. Making the fingerprint sensor just that more useful. So instead of just using the fingerprint sensor to unlock your device, you can also use it to login to your apps, and even authorize purchases on Google Play.. This is one of the areas where many felt that the PRO 6 was a downgrade from the PRO 5. Meizu swapped out the Exynos 7420 that is in the PRO 5, and replaced it with the MediaTek Helio X25 deca-core processor. Not to be clear, MediaTek’s processors aren’t bad, it’s quite the contrary actually. However the new Exynos 8890 is a better processor than the Helio X25 which is what most people were hoping Meizu was going to use this time around. Having said that, the Helio X25 is a deca-core processor, and the Meizu PRO 6 is being marketed as the first deca-core smartphone. It’s a quad-core 1.4GHz processor, quad-core 2.0GHz and a dual-core 2.5GHz processor all wrapped into one. Currently the Helio X20 and X25 are the only deca-core processors available (or announced). In theory, the lightweight tasks will keep the quad-core 1.4GHz cluster going, and the other six cores quiet, while tasks like checking Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc will use the middle cluster of 2.0GHz cores and then high-end stuff like gaming will use the 2.5GHz cluster.. Now how does this work in real life? Well it works quite well. A popular topic among SoC’s lately has been heat. With the Snapdragon 810 being so warm, as well as the Snapdragon 808. The Helio X25 stays quite cool. We’ve played all sorts of games on the PRO 6, and it never got too terribly hot. According to System Monitor, which we’ve had installed the entire time we’ve been using the phone, the temperature never went higher than 96 degrees. So while it stays nice and cool, does the performance suffer? Not really. We’ll save the hardcore numbers for the benchmark section below, but in day-to-day tasks, the Helio X25 performed about as well as the Snapdragon 820 in the LG G5 – which is my daily driver and was used side-by-side with the PRO 6.. When playing games, the Helio X25 definitely is up to the task. With 4GB of RAM, the Meizu PRO 6 does not have any trouble playing games at all. In fact, it may be one of the best smartphones for playing mobile games. Partially due to it having a lower-resolution display – which translates to more battery life and more power for the processor to use for graphics and such.. Multi-tasking is not an issue here. With 4GB of RAM, you’d expect it to be smooth sailing. Unlike Samsung, Meizu does not continually close apps quickly when they are left in memory. We have not needed to clear our recent apps during our review period, not even once. On top of that, we have not needed to reboot the PRO 6 because of performance issues. We see that with many devices, even flagships destined for the US like the Galaxy S7 and HTC 10. This means that performance on the Meizu Pro 6 is definitely top notch.. We ran AnTuTu, 3DMark and GeekBench on the Meizu PRO 6, which you can see those results down below. It wasn’t quite as good as what you would get out of a Snapdragon 820 or Exynos 8890-powered smartphone. But they were still quite respectable.. We already talked briefly about the speaker found on the PRO 6 here. It’s not an amazing speaker, but it does perform quite well. As long as you don’t put your fingers over the speaker holes. There’s no system-wide equalizer available here, but there are a few other features available in the Settings. Which includes the ability to have the ringer, or alarm fade in. It’s a nice touch, although most people probably won’t care anyways.. Listening to music and/or watching videos on the PRO 6 is a great experience. Obviously it’s not going to rival the likes of the HTC 10, considering it does have just one speaker while the HTC 10 does have two of them. But the speaker isn’t too shabby at all. As we alluded to already, the only issue we’ve had is covering up the speaker with a finger or two, particularly when playing games. Otherwise, there’s really no complaints here when it comes to the sound.. As usual, we have been using the Meizu PRO 6 on the T-Mobile network for almost two weeks now. While most of the phones we use from China have just EDGE connectivity in the US, the PRO 6 does support HSPA+. Although it does only support the 1900MHz band on T-Mobile. This means that you will likely be on 3G or EDGE while indoors, but can probably get HSPA+ when outside. Having said that, the speeds we saw when connected to HSPA+ were about what you’d normally see. Our tests showed around 10-15Mbps download and around 1-2Mbps upload. That’s about normal for T-Mobile’s HSPA+ network in this area.. We did make some calls with the Meizu PRO 6 and those on the other end sounded nice and clear. On the flip side, those we called said that we sounded clear as well. There’s no HD Voice support here, seeing as this isn’t a T-Mobile branded smartphone. There’s also no VoLTE support (for one it doesn’t support LTE, and two only T-Mobile branded smartphones can use their VoLTE right now). We didn’t experience any dropped calls either. Which is always a good sign.. For the first few days, battery life was pretty rocky. With the battery draining pretty fast, and quite often, standby was pretty bad. However, it seems to be getting better each and every day. Unfortunately, we don’t have any way to show you screen-on time during a specific battery cycle, due to Meizu’s software. You can see the screen-on time for a 3-hour, 6-hour or 12-hour time period, however. But we did run PCMark on the PRO 6, and it got some pretty good results. Better than some smartphones we’ve tested, but not the best. Out of the last few phones we’ve reviewed, the Huawei P9 sported a result of 4 hours and 17 minutes, with the Leagoo Shark 1 at 8 hours and 22 minutes and the HTC 10 at 7 hours and 50 minutes. The PRO 6 managed to squeak past the HTC 10 with a pretty impressive 7 hours and 58 minutes. It’s impressive due to the size of the battery – a 2560mAh battery in here. Although this shows you one of the big advantages of using an FHD display over a QHD display.. In typical use, the PRO 6 did last about a full day. In fact, a lot of the time it would go through the full day and have around 50% left at the end of the day – of course, that depends on what kind of day we had and what we did with the phone. All in all the battery was pretty impressive.. Meizu has a few tricks up its sleeve, though, with power consumption. In the “Security” app there’s a section for Power. Here you can see the estimated time left on the battery – this is based on how you have been using the phone. You can also decide if you want to turn on Low Power Mode, Super Mode or Customize Mode. All of the options in those modes are customizable too. In settings, you can also determine when you want the phone to go into power-saving mode. Which I have set for 15%. You can also schedule when you want low power on. I have it set for when I’m asleep, around 12-midnight to about 7am. This will extend standby, but you’re also asleep so you don’t really need your notifications right away. They can wait until just before you wake up. This also keeps your phone from waking you up if someone sends you a message in the middle of the night.. As mentioned already, the Meizu PRO 6 does run on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, along with their own OS on top. Which is known as Flyme and we have version 5.2 on our PRO 6 here. This is a slightly updated version from what shipped on the PRO 5 last year. Although Flyme 5 saw the biggest improvements. After using Flyme OS for a few weeks, we can say that it is one of the better UI overlays available on Android. But it’s not without its own flaws. The biggest flaw that we’ve seen is in notifications. With Gmail, Flyme shows the subject and the sender of the email in black. This makes the notification almost impossible to read, given the background of the notification shade. Meizu isn’t the only one that does this either, as Huawei does the same thing with EMUI. It’s an annoyance, and should be something simple that Meizu can fix in an OTA.. Meizu also likes to take some settings out of the settings app and put it in their “Security” app. For instance, Data Usage would be in the main settings app on just about every other smartphone. But with Meizu smartphones, it’s in the security app. Although Meizu does give you more granular control over data usage. You can see how much data you used today, this month and when your billing cycle is over. Battery settings are also in the security app and not the settings app. Again you get more controls for the battery in this app, including the ability to use low-power mode, super mode, and a few others. This also shows you the estimated time remaining. Something that, again, the main settings app should show, but it doesn’t.. Don’t get us wrong, the Security app here in Flyme OS is pretty good. Meizu allows you to quickly optimize your phone by clearing RAM, cache, and apps that are using too much energy. This can make a fairly big change in your battery life. You can also clean out your phone. This will scan your phone and find junk files, redundant APK’s, cache and even apps that you haven’t used in a while. A good tool for anyone that may be running out of space on their smartphone. With this, you can also choose which apps are whitelisted, and also have the phone auto clean at certain intervals. We have it set to once a week at 9pm. The Security app also has a way for you to manage permissions, harassment blocking (blocking messages and calls from specific people), and a built-in anti-virus.. When it comes to the home screen, there’s no app drawer. So all of your apps are right there on the home screen for you to use. For a lot of people, rearranging these apps and folders. can be a pretty daunting task. Meizu has built-in a way for you to rearrange multiple apps at the same time. Making it much, much easier to set up your home screen the way you want. Widgets are also available, should you want to use one. Just pinch in on one of the home screens, and you’ll see that option.. The notification shade is rather nice looking, the background is blurred based on what is showing behind it. And you do have a few quick settings in there, with more available if you swipe down again – including a brightness slider. Unfortunate, but it’s tough to complain about these quick settings. because all of the ones you would want are right there. You have WiFi, Network data, Bluetooth, sound, Airplane Mode, rotation, Location Info, Brightness, Flashlight, SmartTouch and DND (Do Not Disturb). Our only issue with the notification shade is the issue with Gmail and it doesn’t appear to happen with other apps – although we didn’t test other email apps.. SmartTouch, which we mentioned already, is a pretty nifty feature on the Meizu PRO 6. It’s not brand new with the PRO 6 either, as it has been on other smartphones from Meizu. Essentially, it’s a dot that can be moved around on the screen to perform different tasks. Tapping on SmartTouch will go back, Slide Up takes you to the home screen, Slide Down opens the notifications, swiping left or right will take you between apps that are open on the device. These are all customizable (Settings > Accessibility > SmartTouch) and there is also a double tap gesture, which is not set by default. Now we didn’t use SmartTouch that often on the PRO 6, but it does work quite well. If for some reason your home button isn’t working, or you don’t want to use it, this is a great alternative.. There’s another app that is pretty popular on the Meizu PRO 6 and that is ‘Toolbox’. This houses a few pretty useful features like the Flashlight, Mirror, Compass, Level, Ruler and Magnifier. The Flashlight uses the LED flash on the back, all ten of them. You can choose the temperature and brightness, or use it as a SOS. The mirror is pretty self-explanatory, it basically uses your front-facing camera so that you have a mirror in your pocket. Now the ruler might be my favorite feature in this app. It’s something simple, but definitely useful. All of these can be made into home screen shortcuts as well. Making it easier to access them quickly.. Flyme OS may not be our favorite overlay, but it is one of the better ones we’ve seen lately. As we always say, this is Android, so if you don’t like the launcher here, just head to the Play Store and pick one up. This is why we don’t get too bent out of shape over the lack of an app drawer – that and it’s a really popular feature in Asia, where this phone will be sold primarily.. The camera is something I was really excited to try out on the Meizu PRO 6. We expected it to be one of the better camera’s we’ve used out of China lately, and it is. It’s a 21-megapixel Sony sensor on the back, which is actually the same sensor as what we had on the Meizu PRO 5 last year. It does also have phase and laser auto-focus (located in the black area inside the ring of LED flashes), so it can focus in pretty quickly, no matter what lighting condition you may be in. With the LED flash ring on the back of the PRO 6, we were really interested to see how the PRO 6 faired with all this extra light. We took a few night shots with the flash set at different settings, which you can see in the Flickr gallery below. It didn’t make a huge difference, and unless you’re a photographer, you probably won’t notice.. The experience you have when actually trying to take a picture is arguably just as important as the pictures that come from the smartphone you’re using. Meizu did a great job with the camera app here. It’s somewhat “simple” but still jam-packed with features, and they are all in the places you’d expect. So on the row on the left or the top, depending on what orientation you are holding the phone in, you see the Settings gear, along with the camera flip button, a film button (something popular on smartphones in 2016), timer and flash. Across from that is your gallery shortcut, shutter button in the middle and the bottom houses all of the different modes included in the Meizu PRO 6. Speaking of modes, we have 9 here. Auto, Manual, Video, Beauty, Panorama, Light Field, Slow-mo, Macro, and GIF. All of which you’ll find in the Flickr album below.. So how do the pictures look? Pretty darn good. I say this with every review of a phone with a great camera, but it won’t replace your DSLR. It’s tough to find a smartphone camera that will. But the PRO 6 camera will allow you to leave your DSLR at home more often. The colors are pretty accurate in this camera. Unlike Samsung’s cameras where the pictures are pretty saturated, the colors look “natural” in just about every shot. The PRO 6 isn’t fantastic at catching movement, but it could do worse (you can see an example in the AMC Theaters picture). When it comes to Zoom, I was actually pretty surprised. The Meizu PRO 6 handled full zoom pretty well. There is a picture in the gallery of a couple of geese, that was completely zoomed in, without any editing. Could it have been better? Of course. But it could have been far worse, and we’ve seen far worse before.. Fingerprint Sensor + Android 6.0 Fingerprint API. By now, you’ve read almost 4500 words about the Meizu PRO 6. So you probably have a good enough idea of what I think about this phone. I really like the Meizu PRO 6. It’s one of my favorite smartphones to come out this year. I was a bit disappointed with the specs at first – particularly that battery – but Meizu proved to have done a great job at optimizing their software to work well with a smaller battery. There are a few issues with Flyme OS, ones that have been around for quite some time, and. hopefully, they get those fixed but they aren’t deal breakers in our opinion.. The Meizu PRO 6 is not a cheap smartphone. when compared to others coming from China. But when compared to other flagships, it’s pretty cheap. The 32GB model – which is what we have – will set you back around. ¥2499, which converts to about $390 USD. The 64GB model is going to be about. ¥2799, and that converts to about $430 USD. You can pick up the Meizu PRO 6 if you don’t live in China, by hitting the GearBest link below. It’s a bit more expensive, but that’s usually the case when buying Chinese phones outside of China (due to taxes, manufacturing price changes, etc).. Should you buy the Meizu PRO 6? To be honest, I can’t think of a reason not to buy it. If you’re looking for a cheap, but high-end smartphone then it’s a great choice. But if you don’t like the design or think it looks too much like an iPhone, just hang tight for a bit. Another beautiful thing about Android is that the “next big thing” is always just a few days away.. NComputing’s CX110 Chromebook Includes Support for Windows.

Telephony, messaging, multimedia, audio quality 8. Meizu Pro 6 specification User opinions and reviews Review comments (44). Meizu Android Dual SIM. 5.2" 1080p AMOLED display of 423ppi; 3D Press. Heavily customized Flyme OS 5.6 on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. MediaTek Helio X25: deca-core processor with 2x 2.5GHz Cortex-A72, 4x 2.0GHz Cortex-A53, and 4x 1.4GHz Cortex-A53; Mali-T880MP4 GPU; 4GB of RAM. 21MP Sony Exmor RS IMX230 camera sensor with two-tone 10-LED ring flash, 2160p video recording @30fps. 5MP front-facing camera with 1080p@30fps video recording. 32GB or 64GB of built-in storage. 6 LTE (300/50Mbps); Dual SIM; Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac; Bluetooth 4.1; NFC; GPS/GLONASS/Beidou; USB Type-C port, USB On-The-Go. mTouch Home button with a fingerprint scanner. Active noise cancellation via a dedicated mic. 2,560mAh battery with 24W mCharge 2.0 (Up to 65% charge in 30min). Meizu's Pro series has always been about the full flagship experience. Big high-res screens, top-notch chipsets and advanced imaging all wrapped in a fancy package with a teasing price tag.. The MX4 Pro was perhaps the pinnacle of the Pro lineup with its 1536p display and high-end camera setup. The Pro 5 got a slight haircut, trading the near-WQXGA screen resolution for an AMOLED panel and a smoother user experience. The Pro 6 chose to pursue 3D Press and boasts the latest 10-core chipset by MediaTek in an attempt to demonstrate some muscle.. Muscle-flexing is probably the right way to go if you're mostly going to compete against big and powerful phablets of all kinds of makes. The Meizu Pro 6 does have the smallest screen of the last three Pro generations but otherwise takes many cues from its Pro 5 sibling, including the design, storage options and camera department. The big news is the Helio X25 chip but we've yet to see how that compares against the Exynos 7420 Octa that powers the Pro 5.. So, we are going to kick off with that - the Meizu Pro 6s is the first mainstream flagship we meet with the latest Helio X25 chipset. The advanced MediaTek engine employs a deca-core processor with a couple of 2.5GHz Cortex-A72 cores, four 2GHz Cortex-A53's and four 1.4GHz Cortex-A53's. There is also a Mali-T880 MP4 GPU and 4GB of RAM. The Pro 6 is also the first popular Android smartphone to give 3D Touch a go after Apple's attempt in iOS 9 didn't quite make a big splash out of it.. Comparing the Meizu Pro 6 to its Pro 5 sibling, the newer generation has a smaller display leading to a higher pixel density but the battery capacity took a hit due to the more compact body. The two camera units are identical, but the quad-core Mali-T880 GPU might raise questions - we're going to pay special attention comparing it to the Meizu Pro 5's previous gen octa-core unit. On the plus side, the Pro 6 offers 3D Press, which the predecessor doesn't and is generally hard to come by in the Android world.. So, is there enough to draw upgraders and lure switchers? We are going to try and find out. But first, let's check the complete feature list.. The sealed battery is far from unexpected coming from a company whose designs are clearly influenced by Apple's. The cap on memory is a downgrade of sorts compared to the preceding Pro 5. At minimum 32GB and a 64GB version as an alternative, this is something most users can probably live with.. To us, the more interesting question is how much of a powerhouse the Pro 6 is. We'll run the benchmarks in the dedicated chapter and analyze the results. The 3D Press will get due attention as well.. Of course, the Pro 6 isn't going to only target upgraders - we bet Meizu is keen to bring new customers in as well. So, let's see if their latest phablet is really up to the task.. Special thanks to HonorBuy.com for providing the review unit.. Telephony, messaging, multimedia, audio quality 8. Meizu Pro 6 specification User opinions and reviews Review comments (44).

Meizu is well known for creating their mid-range and entry-level smartphones that are surprisingly and competitively low-cost, but the Chinese OEM does have some solid high-end phones on offer as well, that continue to be priced quite aggressively. For Meizu, these high-end devices are seen in the form of “Pro” iterations of their base “MX” flagships so basically; it aimed to be at the flagship category. This time around, Meizu seems to have done away with the MX line by jumping directly into the releasing the latest Pro edition smartphone.. Meizu attempts to do things a little differently and includes a few unique design elements, that allows some distictive attributes from the design of the iPhone, and previous generation Meizu smartphones as well. It comes with a 5.2 inches Super AMOLED multi capacitive touchscreen, delivering 1080 x 1920 pixels (~423 ppi pixel density) display resolution, with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 for protection. It also uses 3D Touch display together with its Flyme 5.6 skin on top. The Meizu Pro 6 runs on Android OS, v6.0 (Marshmallow), powered by a powerful Mediatek MT6797T Helio X25 processo clocked with Dual-core 2.5 GHz Cortex-A72 & quad-core 2 GHz Cortex-A53 & quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53, paired with Mali-T880 MP4 GPU. It doesn ‘t have SD card slot for an extended memory storage, however, it ‘s available in 32/64GB of built-in storage and bears 4GB of RAM. It boasts 21MP primary camera with phase detection & laser autofocus, ten-LED (dual tone) flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR, panorama, and 5MP secondary camera. It also features Fast battery charging capability of up 26% in 10 min/ 100% in 60 min, Active noise cancellation with dedicated mic, Fingerprint, accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, and barometer. It also packs with WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, Radio, NFC, and USB for the connectivity options. The Meizu Pro 6 houses a rather small 2,560 mAh non-removable battery, but the battery life is still quite good and can sustain through moderate usage. You will get around 3 hours and 45 minutes of screen-on time with moderate usage, and for the most part, that may be enough to get you comfortably through a full day of use but you may find yourself needing to recharge the phone half way through your day.. When something is needed to be tweaked and fixed, rooting is the ultimate tool that you need.

Bearing an undeniable similarity to the iPhone and carrying the latest version of Flyme OS, the Meizu Pro 6 is the most recent attempt to win over users who want high power at a low price. It’s a device with several virtues, but originality is not among them.. ✕ No 800 MHz LTE band. Meizu Pro 6 release date and price. While the Meizu Pro 6 is unlikely to see an official. the 32 GB version can be ordered online from mid-August for 2,499 CNY, which works out at around $374. There will also be a 64 GB version, which comes in rose gold, but its price has not yet been confirmed.. Meizu Pro 6 design and build quality. The text at the bottom says, "Designed by Meizu". During the week I spent with the Meizu Pro 6, three different people have asked me if I had bought a new iPhone. The similarities between this phone and Apple's flagship are undeniable at first glance, but this is nothing new for Meizu, whose designs have always drawn deep inspiration from the Cupertino company.. Leaving aside obvious comparisons, it is easy to admit that the Pro 6 is a phone with a sleek and slim design. Its dimensions find a perfect balance between ease of use and enjoyment of multimedia.. The front of the device features slimmer bezels than the iPhone, and there’s an oval home button below the screen, while at the top there is the front camera and call speaker, as well as a proximity sensor.. On the back panel, the arrangement is similar to that seen in the leaked images of the iPhone 7, i.e., plastic strips lining the upper and lower edges. The Meizu logo is in the centre, below a 10-LED flash and the main camera lens. The speaker, headphone jack and USB Type-C port are all located along the bottom of the frame.. Meizu is not the only manufacturer to be inspired by the iPhone, but it is the most obvious example. The design of the Pro 6 is far from unpleasant, but if you're thinking of picking one up, you have to be willing to accept suspicious looks and questions every time you pull it out your pocket.. The display is bright enough for any lighting conditions. Up until now, the Meizu Pro line could be understood easily in relation to the Samsung Note line: larger screens and pumped up specs. But not anymore: the 5.2-inch Pro 6 is closer in dimensions to the main 2016 flagships, while it’s the Meizu MX6 that comes with a larger, 5.5-inch display.. The resolution is Full HD, resulting in 423 ppi, which, unless you're thinking of using virtual reality, is more than sufficient to ensure sharp image quality. In addition, the technology used is AMOLED, so color reproduction and contrast are excellent.. The brightness is also more than acceptable, even when used under strong artificial light or direct sunlight.. The Meizu Pro 6 has neither capacitive nor on-screen buttons. Force Touch on the Meizu Pro 6. Alarms in Flyme OS (left) and iOS (right). The Pro 6 comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Pasted over this is Flyme OS 5.2, Meizu’s own UI, which dispenses with the app drawer and features gesture recognition.. The home button is the only navigation button on the phone, meaning there are neither capacitive nor on-screen buttons. Place your finger on the button to use it as a return button, press. home screen, and swipe from the bottom of the screen upwards to open the recent apps drawer.. This configuration sounds more complicated than it is: in a few minutes it is easy to get used to the gestures. Perhaps the only problem is that the recent apps drawer will sometimes open up by mistake, especially when playing games designed for vertical orientation, such as Sonic Dash.. Besides this, Flyme brings a feature called Smart Touch. When enabled in Quick Settings, a small, floating joystick-like button appears, and each movement of the button is used for a different action: press on it to go back, slide it up to return to the home screen, down to open the notification bar, etc. All of these actions are customizable.. The phone also features Force Touch, but it is only compatible with Flyme’s own applications, like Gallery, Notes, etc. By pressing firmly on these apps’ icons, a different actions menu opens up. Force Touch can also be used within each application, such as in the above image, where a firm press has been used to open up a photo from a thumbnail. Force Touch has not proven too popular among manufacturers and Android developers (the only ones that have displayed interest in this feature have been Chinese manufacturers), so it is hard to see it being very useful in the long term.. The amount of preinstalled applications is not overwhelming, and virtually all are relatively useful, but none of them are uninstallable. They have a very similar appearance to their iOS counterparts, using color palettes and designs familiar to even the most casual iOS user.. The international version of the phone comes with Google Maps and Play Store, but no other Google applications. have to be downloaded from the Play Store.. Meizu has used Samsung’s Exynos chips in the past, but the Pro 6 is powered by the MediaTek Helio X25, which runs two Cortex A-72 cores clocked at at 2.5 GHz, four A-53 cores at 2 GHz, and four A-53 cores at 1.4 GHz. There is 4 GB of RAM on board, and there’s the option of 32 or 64 GB of internal storage.. Generally speaking, there is little to complain about when it comes to the Pro 6’s performance. Except for minor and irrelevant exceptions, games work perfectly. The graphics processing may not be as good as the Galaxy S7 Edge, but neither is any other phone’s in this price range.. Multitasking using the recent apps drawer can sometimes slow the device down, but apps can also easily be closed from this window, similarly to how they’re handled in MIUI, Xiaomi’s UI. There is also a Cleaner and an. Accelerator to be found in the Security application that comes preinstalled on the phone, which helps to speed things up a bit.. The Pro 6’s storage is not expandable via microSD. Another disadvantage is the lack of LTE 800 MHz band.. 21 MP and a 10-LED flash. As with most Chinese manufacturers, the camera has never been the main attraction of Meizu phones. The Pro 6 comes with a Sony IMX 230 sensor, which captures images at a maximum resolution of 21 MP, and the lens has an aperture of f / 2.2. Its autofocusing works using a hybrid laser and phase detection system.. Noise management could certainly be improved, and although images usually come out pretty sharp, the white balance needs work, and color reproduction is inaccurate.. The Meizu Pro 6 is capable of taking decent images, especially under favorable light conditions, but, as expected, its results are clumsy in low-light and at night. If you consider a high-quality camera an essential requirement in your next phone, you'll have to look elsewhere. Even the cheaper Moto G4 Plus is capable of taking better pictures than the Meizu Pro 6.. The camera software is simple and intuitive, and its design resembles that of TouchWiz, Samsung’s UI. It also has its own manual mode that, while interesting, rarely produces better results than the automatic mode.. Battery tests don’t place the Meizu Pro 6 in great standing with its competition. In Geekbench 3, it achieved half the score of the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. This isn’t very surprising when you consider that the Pro 6 has a 2560-mAh battery in a year in which 3,000 mAh have become the norm among the high end.. The battery life is not ideal in practice, either, but it is not so far removed from the competition as the benchmarks suggest. Heavy use, including watching films and taking photos will mean the device is unlikely to survive a day, but moderate, everyday use should allow for 24-hours of life.. In addition, the Pro 6 comes with fast charging, which will see the device fully charged in under an hour, and there is also a decent battery-saving mode.. 148 x 71 x 7.3 mm. 1920 x 1080 pixels (424 ppi). Appearance shouldn’t be the most important factor when deciding on a new smartphone. However, the iPhone inspires the Meizu Pro 6. both inside and out, and in the Western market, where derivative iPhone designs are frowned upon,. The Meizu Pro 6 is far from a bad phone and its software, despite a slightly esoteric approach, has its advantages.. Is the Meizu Pro 6 a good buy? It is, but not for all users. For $370 you get a phone with above average performance, but the battery and the camera are often aspects that most users tend to value above the rest, and when it comes to these, the Meizu Pro 6 disappoints..

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. Canon's AI flash moves by itself to make portraits more flattering. Lenovo's Yoga 730 is a cheaper 2-in-1 with Alexa support. The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. Sony will sell its wireless 'open-ear' buds in the US. Meizu's 10-core phone gets a 10-LED camera flash. It's also cloned Apple's 3D Touch.. You may recall that the world's first 10-core mobile chip, the MediaTek Helio X20 series, is expected to hit the market this month. Indeed, today Meizu announced its Pro 6 smartphone which has nabbed exclusivity over the flagship Helio X25, yet it only starts from 2,499 yuan or about $390 off-contract. The specs don't disappoint: You get a gorgeous 5.2-inch 1080p Super AMOLED screen, 2.5D Gorilla Glass 3, 4GB of RAM, internal storage starting at 32GB, front-side fingerprint reader, LTE Cat 6 radio and a USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C port (up to 5 Gbps). The only thing missing here is NFC, if you're a fan of that.. Despite the smaller 2,560 mAh battery (the Pro 5 had 3,050 mAh), it's somewhat compensated by the 24W rapid charging feature that takes just one hour to go from zero to 100 percent. Just to ease our minds, Meizu added that the appropriate thermal and short-circuit protection mechanisms are all there. Depending on your usage behavior, the Helio X25's tri-cluster architecture should also help extend battery life, but we'll see about that when the reviews roll in.. The Pro 6 comes in a smooth aluminum body that's only a tad thinner than the iPhone 6s Plus, and while its general shape, bottom edge layout plus color options -- gold, gray and silver -- will unfortunately remind you of Apple's offerings, Meizu tries to distract you by curving the ends of the two plastic antenna bands on the back, as well as applying a more symmetrical design all over by repositioning the camera parts. Strangely, the result is a nice improvement over the iPhone 6s' aging design.. Alas, the Pro 6 also comes with "3D Press" which, as you can tell by the name, is a cheeky clone of Apple's 3D Touch: Depending on how hard to press the screen, you can toggle a shortcut menu and preview contents such as images, messages, e-mails, URLs and more. Meizu says many popular Chinese apps like WeChat, Weibo, Youku and QQ will be supported at launch. It'll be interesting to see whether Apple will take action (it wouldn't be the first time , anyway), but then again, Huawei already has a similar touch pressure recognition feature on its Mate S and its more recent P9 Plus .. Given the same old mid-range Sony IMX230 sensor featured in this 21.16-megapixel f/2.2 main camera, chances are it won't beat those offered by the mainstream smartphone brands; plus it is now covered by a piece of Gorilla Glass 3 instead of the harder sapphire, which is clearly a cost-cutting move. That said, it does come with an improved laser autofocus, along with a small ring flash consisting of 10 LEDs -- a first for smartphones -- which is quite fitting given the phone's 10-core CPU. On the other side, you have a 5-megapixel f/2.0 selfie camera just like before, and as you'd expect with any Chinese smartphone these days, the Pro 6 comes with beautification features to save you money on cosmetics.. Perhaps the most interesting feature here is "mSound": It's a fancy name for Meizu's combination of NXP's third-generation smart amplifier system and its loudspeaker at the bottom, which not only claims to produce loud audio with little distortion, but it can also use the speaker -- by detecting the vibration on the diaphragm -- for noise suppression while recording audio. As for headphone playback, you can take advantage of the Pro 6's Cirrus Logic CS43L36 DAC chip for supposedly cleaner audio with a wide dynamic range. Naturally, lossless audio formats like FLAC and APE are supported here.. There's no word on global availability yet, but the dual-SIM Pro 6 is already available for pre-ordering in China, starting with 32GB version for 2,499 yuan (about $390). The 64GB version will arrive later for just 2,799 yuan (about $430).. 10-core , china , CS43L36 , gear , heliox25 , meizu , mobile , pro6 , smartphone , tri-cluster.

With a 21MP 1/2.4-inch sensor and F2.2 aperture the Pro 6's main camera specifications have remained the same compared to the PRO 5 but there is one notable change on the new model: the dual-tone flash is now made from 10 LEDs that are arranged in a circular pattern on the back plate. The diameter of the circle is too small for the lights to have a ring-flash effect but we would assume that at least the output power is higher than on more conventional LED-flashes. As before, both phase detection AF and laser-assistance for measuring of subject-distance are on board as well. The front module uses a 5MP sensor with a relatively large pixel size of 1.4 µm and F2.0 aperture.. The new model comes with a relatively modest 5.2-inch 1080p Super AMOLED display compared to the PRO 5's 5.7-inch screen. However, the loss in size is easily made up for by the new 3D Press feature, Meizu's equivalent to Apple's 3D Touch pressure sensitive display technology.
