Just know that the mid-range specs will only get you so far and its entertainment capabilities make this BlackBerry feel as if it clocks out at 5pm sharp when it comes to the fun stuff.. £499 (Silver - 3GB RAM, 32GB) or £549 (Black - 4GB RAM, 64GB) $549 (Silver - 3GB RAM, 32GB), no date for Black Edition BlackBerry's signature keys return, spurning the new all-screen trend Makes for a more precise, but slow typing experience Neat tricks: 52 key shortcuts, trackpad-like movement and suggested word-flicking gestures Two-tone sophisticated look Biometric fingerprint scanner is hidden inside the space bar Ironically named connivence key is more annoying than it is helpful Strangely, no dual-SIM option for international business travelers 4.5-inch Full HD screen feels like a 5.5-inch screen due to bigger width and your thumbs staying put on the keyboard The bright display looks great, but its 3:2 aspect ratio forces 16:9 video to feel small by placing black bars at the top and bottom This is not a multimedia showstopper, it's a workhorse Runs Android 7.1.1 with helpful BlackBerry software and security Great, all-encompassing BlackBerry Hub combines almost all of your message services Gridview of recent apps makes switching apps easier even if the smaller screen makes true multitasking cramped Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 octa-core is a mid-range chipset It's fast enough for multitasking, but isn't mean for heavy gaming 32GB of internal storage and single-SIM are anti-business KeyOne Black Edition bumps storage to 64GB and RAM to 4GB 12MP camera does a better than expected job, even if it's not to Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy S8 standards 8MP front-facing camera is good, but suffers greatly in low light conditions BlackBerry's cumbersome camera app is the biggest issue here 3,505mAh battery last between 26 and 36 hours in our testing Superb battery-saving background tricks whenever the phone is idle Loses only 2% of battery life overnight and recharges very quickly Enterprise phone users Businesses buying in bulk Entertainment seekers Selfie takers. Update: Our BlackBerry KeyOne review has been updated to reflect the recently released premium “Black Edition”, featuring a tweaked design, more RAM and more internal storage.. Move over, Samsung Galaxy S8. The BlackBerry KeyOne is the latest smartphone comeback story of 2017, even if the company behind it is really just China’s TCL Communications.. It’s touted as the most secure Android phone, pre-loaded with smart, enterprise-level mobile software and, at last, delivers an old-school physical keyboard within a modern enough stainless steel and faux-leather design.. For a few pennies more, an all-black model is also available for the discerning executive (dubbed 'Black Edition'), with a little more RAM and internal storage to boot.. This is the reinvented BlackBerry for everyone wholly determined to reclaim a tactile keyboard and BlackBerry Messenger. It works great for typing once you get used to the keys again. We were actually more accurate at typing with it, though we never faster versus using an on-screen keyboard.. ‘CrackBerry’ addicts have something to look forward to here. BlackBerry KeyOne is all business in the front and back, less of a multimedia party anywhere in between.. The screen is bright and colorful, but while its 3:2 aspect ratio is great for viewing emails, it leaves you with unsightly black bars on all 16:9 video. It makes movies look really small. The audio comes out through a single bottom-firing speaker, too. It’s like this phone clocks out at 5pm sharp when it comes to the fun stuff.. It borrows camera specs from other top-tier top phones, with a 12MP sensor right out of the Google Pixel. Photos are good, though the shared specs only go so far: it doesn't have the same backend camera image stabilization software and its front-end camera app is a mess.. BlackBerry KeyOne is clearly an Android phone that has productivity users in mind. It works as an entertainment device, too, but it’s not the best at it. Sure, it doesn’t have the fastest chipset and a fancy new display, yet it’s one of the best phones at helping you manage day-to-day tasks and will last you the entire day with battery life that lasts more than 24 hours.. What it lacks in top-of-the-line internal chip specs it tries to make up for with unique features like sophisticated software and its physical keyboard. It’s a trade-off that makes it slightly cheaper.. Does this new BlackBerry phone have enough of an enterprise advantage to lure you back from your on-screen, makebelieve keyboard? Let’s get down to business and put it to the test.. The BlackBerry KeyOne price is somewhere in between Wall Street and Main Street, costing $549 (£499, AU$729). It’s cheaper than an iPhone 7 or the Samsung Galaxy S8.. In the US, there are two versions: an unlocked edition that’s GSM and CDMA capable across the networks, and a summer-bound CDMA model for Sprint.. In the UK, it was launched early at London's prestigious Selfridges and eventually came to Carphone Warehouse on May 5. More UK retailers and carriers have come on board, including John Lewis and Currys.. For those looking for even more power, the new ‘Black’ Edition is available in certain markets, packing a smart new all-black paint job plus more RAM and double the storage compared to the base model. It's currently retailing for £549 in the UK.. The Blackberry KeyOne is all about its physical keyboard in a world dominated by touchscreen iPhones and Androids. It’s the exact opposite of the Galaxy S8 and LG G6 all-screen trend.. BlackBerry’s signature keyboard is a welcomed change if you miss the tactile feedback of a real smartphone keyboard. There are 35-chiclet-style keys, and each one it properly backlit with no need for an on-screen keyboard to hog your display.. It does take several hours of typing to re-learn how use it. B shares a key with ! and caused us to say “How’s your day goingB” with quickly apologize. We found ourselves making fewer typing mistakes going back to a BlackBerry, but overall slower in our characters-per-minute output. We.e were never faster versus typing on an on-screen keyboard, just more accurate and less autocorrect dependent.. There are several twists to make life easier. It has 52 customizable shortcuts, so every long and short press gets you somewhere faster. Hold down on the ‘I’ key while on the home screen and you instantly get to Instagram.. Blackberry KeyOne has three-word suggestions across the bottom of the touchscreen as part of its contextual next word prediction engine. It’s smart, but doesn't have punctuation predictions or, like iOS 10 ,. That’s too fun for a BlackBerry.. You can, however, select a suggested word without ever lifting your thumbs from the keyboard. Just slide up on the keys and it’ll almost flick the word right onto the screen. It works most of the time and feels faster than tapping one of the on-screen choices.. The entire keyboard also acts as a trackpad, so you can scroll through menus and web pages as you lightly pet the keys. You, again, don’t need to put your fingers on the screen.. Compared to the glory days of full mobile keyboards, it can feel a little cramped, however this is the best hardware keyboard to grace Android in years.. The BlackBerry KeyOne has an air of sophistication, even as it blends the old and the new technology.. It looks like a productivity tool carried by the workforce elite, with the Black Edition in particular looking like the love-child of a Thinkpad and a Rolls Royce.. Its screen-and-keyboard combo is outlined in a silver anodized aluminum frame and backed by a black, soft grip textured rear cover. This stylish, two-toned look is has real character, while the darker Black Edition is still more subtle in its premium look.. No, the rubberized back isn’t really leather, but it gives that impression. The aluminum frame is scratch-resistant and stood up to our minor testing abuse. Not everyone has had such luck, with a few people reporting that the screen pops out rather easily with a little bend.. The good news is that this flaw has been addressed as an issue in the manufacturing process by TCL, and a fix was implemented to ensure new handsets rolling off the production line wouldn't suffer the same fate.. The most clever thing about this new BlackBerry design is that it hides the fingerprint sensor inside the small space bar at the bottom of the phone. It’s an odd shape for a biometric scanner.. The good news is that the blended fingerprint sensor works really well here with a near 0% fail rate (assuming your fingers aren't wet). It’s also easy to access on the front and it can wake the phone from a screen-off state.. There's also a custom 'convenience' button we mapped to the camera app, but found it more annoying than helpful due to its easy-to-mispress location. The inability of this button to also wake the device from sleep further limits its usefulness day-to-day.. During calls, it functions as a mute button, which we found useful. It’s easy to remember this button exists during active calls, not when you’re first picking up your smartphone from a table. For fingers trained to the more common right-side volume rocker then power button layout, it takes a lot of getting used to.. There's no upside to the mono speaker on the bottom frame. It helps no one – on-the-go entertainment seekers and business speakerphone devotees alike.. We’re also surprised the BlackBerry KeyOne doesn’t have a dual nano SIM tray when many unlocked phones out of China now have a second SIM / microSD card tray. This just has the latter, to the chagrin of jet-setting international business travelers.. While the KeyOne Black Edition may be enough to sway finicky executives in the looks department, it does nothing to solve the base design issues of the original, rather the higher price compounds them.. BlackBerry KeyOne Black Edition hands on gallery. The device is razor focused on the tasks of typing and reading text, which doesn't often lend it well to the realities of owning a top-tier smartphone in 2017.. I would have been nice to see the stippled soft touch plastic rear make way for a sheet of matte aluminium, given the higher price point and more premium focus.. The BlackBerry KeyOne display shares the front face of the phone with the keyboard, so it can’t compare to an trendy new all-screen Android phone. You just can't have everything in life.. Its 4.5-inch Full HD screen is misshapen, with one third of the phone real estate taken up by non-screen parts: keyboard, capacitive buttons and front camera.. It feels like a 5.5-inch display thanks to its familiar 3-inch width, and we wouldn’t want it much longer. Anything taller would make this already 180g phone feel top-heavy when holding the very bottom of the keyboard.. We end up with a screen that’s bright, colorful and gives you more usable space thanks to the the keyboard and trackpad-like scrolling. Sadly, not every app adjusts to a 1,620 x 1,080 resolution.. At this price, the inclusion of an LCD rather than a more punchy and colorful AMOLED screen feels a little like unnecessarily cost cutting, especially for the more premium Black Edition.. You’re going to run into problems with the 3:2 aspect ratio on a daily basis. All 16:9 video feels extra small with top and bottom black bars. Snapchats and Instagram Stories are also cut off, but for the type of user the KeyOne is targeting it's unlikely to matter too much,. The good news most productivity apps and interactive games adapt to the size. It’s just movies and fixed-length photo apps that give the BlackBerry KeyOne trouble.. You’ll find split-screen multitasking thanks to Android 7.1 Nougat, but it’s a bit cramped. There are a few sacrifices if you want a keyboard on a smartphone in the modern day.. The KeyOne runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat with a BlackBerry twist. You have access to all of the Google Play Store apps, plus a few enterprise-focused programs and interface tweaks.. BlackBerry Hub is the highlight of the software. It combines your notifications, messages calls, and events into one streamlined location. You can easily sift through almost every account in your hectic work life: BlackBerry Messenger, texts, email, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, Slack, WhatsApp and Twitter.. BlackBerry Hub works because of deep customization. You customize alert rules to effortlessly toggle which accounts show up instead of doing it one-by-one. In our custom 'Vacation Mode,’ we turned off Twitter, Slack and work email alerts, but kept texts and Facebook Messenger enabled. We reserved it in our ‘Daily Work Day’ recipe for a productive day – all done without unticking individual account boxes each time.. BlackBerry Messenger is viable messaging app, but hardly the best. We liked the Time and Retract feature (Snapchat for grown ups), but were less impressed by its sponsored ads and lack of a desktop companion app. This is an enterprise phone, right?. Swiping in from the right brings up a productivity tab, where unread emails, upcoming events, a to do list and more are displayed. This is active by default on every screen, but can be disabled if you wish.. DTEK is the security app that keeps your phone safe. It constantly monitors your device’s security status level and gives you a rating. You can review permissions of every app to understand the information they can access, and keep track of vulnerabilities. DTEK is the one BlackBerry app you never want to really have to use.. BlackBerry KeyOne's has a stock Android vibe, but we found the tweaked recent menu helpful. It opens up your most recent apps in an assorted gridview that's easier to browse through than with the fanned-out look of every other phone.. It tries to pull off a 3D touch shortcuts interface within its homescreen apps, but it’s not fleshed out. Swiping up on apps sometimes get you a mini window of the app’s most important information (helpful), but too many apps don’t support this yet; it’s just option to add widgets to the homescreen (not helpful).. The BlackBerry KeyOne can feel a little ‘untidy’ at times, with dual email apps, dual calendar apps and more all cluttering up the app drawer.. The BlackBerry KeyOne is priced less than a Samsung or LG flagship phone for good reason: it doesn’t have flagship level specs and performance.. Its Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 octa-core chipset is fast enough for most day-to-day work tasks, and its 64-bit capabilities ensure multitasking is fairly smooth.. Occasional slowdown happened when we were playing games; its 3GB of RAM and Adreno 506 graphics chip put the KeyOne a step behind other phones. Don’t expect the smoothest frame rates or performance.. It also starts with 32GB of internal storage, not 64GB, and while it has a microSD card slot, it doesn’t turn into a second nano SIM slot for dual-SIM use.. Its occasional slowdown and single-SIM support shouldn’t turn you off if you love the keyboard, but it is an odd pairing: mid-range specs with high-end phone design and software features.. The story does change a little with the BlackBerry KeyOne Black Edition. With 64GB of internal storage, there is a lot more room to spread out, most people will find it to be enough.. With an extra 1GB of RAM there is a small, but palpable difference in performance, with things running a little more smoothly.. This doesn’t make the KeyOne a gaming powerhouse, but it certainly makes checking email a little quicker.. BlackBerry KeyOne has a main 12MP camera that captures large 1.55um and we found it to do a superb job in daylight and a decent job in low light, too. A lot of this is thanks to multi-frame low light capabilities that try to suss out the best photo from multiple shots.. It has Phase Detect Auto Focus for faster focusing, and electronic image stabilization (EIS) for steady photos and video for reducing camera shake. We found EIS video to be smooth, but not as gimbal-steady as the optical image stabilization (OIS) of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus .. You’re also going to have a better chance at a good photo in low light with the Google Pixel due to both backend and front-end software. It shares the Sony IMX378 camera sensor, but this only does so much for the BlackBerry KeyOne.. Turning on HDR helps, but we found photos to generally be a little darker than we would have liked without editing them first to increase exposure.. Image 1 of 6 BlackBerry KeyOne front-facing camera. Image 2 of 6 BlackBerry KeyOne main camera. Image 3 of 6 BlackBerry KeyOne main camera. Image 4 of 6 BlackBerry KeyOne main camera (low-light test). Image 5 of 6 BlackBerry KeyOne main camera (motion test). Image 6 of 6 Main camBlackBerry KeyOne main camera (food test). BlackBerry's camera app is unfixable nuisance. It has very few modes (Photo, Pano, Video and Slow-Mo) and they’re all hidden in a mode menu. That means you have to dig into a menu to switch between photos and videos instead of having available on the screen at all times. The KeyOne can shoot 4K video at 30 frames per second and 1080p at 60fps. Oddly, switching between all of its various video resolutions and frame rates is right at the top of the camera app. That’s at least easy to access.. The front-facing camera takes 8MP shots with similar results as the main rear camera. Great in daylight, but its f/2.2 lens and 1.125um pixel size can’t stand up to low light.. Moving subjects should still be advised to stay absolutely motionless in less than stellar lighting conditions. "Next person to even say ‘Cheese’ is out of the group selfie.". BlackBerry KeyOne is a smartphone built for today’s workaholics right down to the battery life. It lasted us almost a day and a half in our battery life tests.. Its 3,505mAh battery capacity is rated for 26 hours, but we found lasted longer by draining only 2% when we left it idle at night (testing time: exactly eight hours). So 26 hours turned out to be closer to 36 hours for us. There's no need to bring a power pack on the go when starting a day of constant emailing.. Say what you will about its slower Snapdragon 625 chipset; it's at least battery efficient. Watching an HD video for 90 minutes at full brightness only took the battery down to 89%, losing a very respectable 11%.. Here’s something else to like: It can juice back up to 50% in just 36 minutes and takes 1 hour and 52 minutes total to reach 100%. which suspends some performance for faster charging gains.. BlackBerry KeyOne doesn’t have an always-on screen for anything else, it always lets you know the charging percentage and slowly growing a red and then green bar along the side of the screen whenever it’s plugged in.. BlackBerry KeyOne is the smartphone for anyone who has ever said ‘I miss my old BlackBerry.’ It reinvents the tactical QWERTY keyboard phone for the modern Android era. It's for everyone who has felt exiled to on-screen keyboards over last half decade.. Buying in bulk for employees? You'll appreciate the front-and-center DTEK security app, solid battery life and BlackBerry Hub. There’s no excuse for workers to miss your messages now. It's also cheaper than other top phones.. This is not fit for multimedia due to its misshapen 3:2 screen that puts black bars on the top and bottom of 16:9 video and single speaker. This is far from an all-screen phone. It's all for work and not for play.. You won't get the best selfies from the front-facing camera, even though the rear camera is pretty good. Lowlight causes too much blurring and switching between the two camera in the main app is a confusing mess..

CNET también está disponible en español.. BlackBerry KeyOne: Six things I love/don't love so far (review in progress). Here's what I think after some time with the BlackBerry's ambitious keyboard phone.. by May 4, 2017 6:00 AM PDT. BlackBerry KeyOne wants to make the keyboard cool again. BlackBerry KeyOne has a physical keyboard filled with.... What I like so far This is the most premium BlackBerry I've seen in years Fast, accurate fingerprint reader (integrated into the keyboard) Customizable convenience key opens any app or shortcut You can program 52 keyboard shortcuts (but you probably wouldn't want to) The productivity tab, reminiscent of the Galaxy S8 tab, is useful Software tidbits: Layout of Recents tab, floating phone button lets you pop back into a call when you switch screens What I'm not so into It's heavy and sits uncomfortably on my pinky finger when I hold it The keyboard feels cramped There's a dedicated $ key, but no dedicated period, comma or @ button The convenience key seems to trigger easily in my bag (I set it to the camera and found at least a dozen errant photos) There aren't as many camera options as competing devices (but you can dig around for the manual mode) It isn't water-resistant Size and screen Keyboard and tricks. Galaxy S8, LG G6 and iPhone 7. Weeks after BlackBerry revealed the brand's big comeback phone , to the joy of BlackBerry die-hards and other lovers of physical keyboards, the KeyOne finally landed on my desk. Full disclaimer: I've been given a preproduction unit, and it isn't finished. (It got a software update yesterday, in fact.) Things could still change by the time the phone is fully released at the end of May; therefore, no rated review from me just yet. This is not a phone to judge quickly or lightly.. What the KeyOne is, is an ambitious endeavor to recover the brand's reputation. Once one of the world's top two phonemakers, BlackBerry has dwindled in the past decade. Its last few devices failed to make a positive impression. Now with BlackBerry hardware in the hands of TCL, the company behind Alcatel phones, BlackBerry has an opportunity to wow buyers with something unique: a premium Android phone with a QWERTY -- rather than virtual -- keyboard. And BlackBerry-branded security software too, of course. (There's also support for corporate buyers, but my assessment focuses on individual consumers.). The KeyOne pairs physical buttons with a 4.5-inch touch screen.. Like other Android hopefuls, the KeyOne faces steep competition against more established players, such as Samsung's Galaxy S8 , LG's G6 and Google's Pixel , but in this case, the keyboard will be the deciding factor for most.. So while I simply need to spend more time testing the phone before I know how well the KeyOne has lived up to its promise, I will share what I like so far, and what hasn't connected. Check back for my final assessment of a production device, ratings and all.. The KeyOne goes on sale in the US on May 31 for $549. It'll work on all four major US carriers, but will initially sell from BlackBerryMobile.com and other online retailers. In Canada, it'll roll out through carriers first. Posh London department store Selfridges will have it first in the UK, then it'll go out to the masses in Carphone Warehouse stores on May 5, for £499. Australian details are TBA, but the UK price converts to about AU$870.. BlackBerry KeyOne wants to make the keyboard cool again. Smaller than the iPhone 7 Plus and larger than the Galaxy S8, the BlackBerry KeyOne has a 4.5-inch screen topping off that signature keyboard. At 6.3 ounces (180 grams), the KeyOne is heavier than the Galaxy S8, iPhone 7 and Google Pixel, but it's a bit lighter than the iPhone 7 Plus.. The KeyOne feels heavy, and when I hold it to type, the charger port presses down on my pinky. I tried bracing the phone against my ring finger, but that felt less natural and still uncomfortable. You might not have the same problem if you use a different grip or if the phone falls in a different place on your hands.. I didn't mind the smaller screen overall, and I didn't feel I had to squint to read it. If you're used to an iPhone 6 or 7, this is just a bit smaller. Any larger and the phone would have been too tall and even heavier; this is an adequate trade-off.. The KeyOne's physical keyboard is a BlackBerry trademark. It has rectangular buttons that are wider than they are tall. The "O" actually looks like it was tipped on its side. Unlike the iconic Bold, the KeyOne's buttons have no ridges.. BlackBerry KeyOne, meet iconic BlackBerry Bold.. What it does have are capacitive sensors that mean you can swipe left and right over the top to, say, flip among home screens. You can flick up on the buttons to select predictive text (previous BlackBerry phones have had this too).. And you can map a long or short press of any key to launch an app or shortcut -- up to 52 of them in total (good luck remembering them all). The phone will even suggest apps or contacts to pair to, such as "I" for "Instagram," "Y" for "Yelp" and "M" for "Mom.". The fingerprint reader is built right into the home button.. Typing felt cramped even for my smaller-size fingers, and I made mistakes but I admit I'm still retraining myself after years with virtual keyboards every day (I used to pine for the QWERTY's return). The short keyboard height is clearly part of the trade-off to keep the KeyOne from getting too tall.. I like the keyboard shortcuts, but am not sure I could remember 52 of them. The fingerprint reader is working very well so far.. I like a good convenience key for launching any app I pair with it. On the KeyOne, the button on the phone's right edge can open Google Voice Search, the camera or any other app or shortcut you use a lot.. I love convenience keys and I like that this one's customizable. I'm still deciding what to put here. Since I can trigger the camera by double-pressing the volume button, I don't really need it there. Google Assistant is pretty easy to get to. And the button seems to trigger in my bag, so I hesitate to assign it to a person and call them unintentionally.. Swipe the tab to see upcoming appointments, recent calls, tasks and unread messages.. Taking a cue from Samsung's Edge phones, the KeyOne has a little tab you can pull over on any screen. This opens a module that shows you upcoming appointments and tasks, and lets you view some recent messages. There's also a Settings menu you can access to customize the tab's size, placement and transparency.. I think it's helpful to see my calendar appointments and messages from any screen, but I'd love it more if I could customize what to include and keep out.. The 12-megapixel camera has an automatic mode that's got plenty of filters, auto-HDR and panorama, but not the truckload of features you see on other devices. This might suit you fine, especially if you mostly take photos using automatic mode. There's a pro mode you can turn on in the camera settings, which gives you much finer control over white balance, ISO and all the rest.. An 8-megapixel front-facing camera takes straightforward selfies. You can apply the usual filters.. Image quality was fine, but not as bright or lush as the Galaxy S8, which also has a 12-megapixel lens. Images were a little less detailed on the KeyOne, but so far I'd be happy enough to share them online and with friends.. BlackBerry fans will be glad to see BlackBerry Hub, which is a universal message inbox and BBM (BlackBerry Messenger), as well as the Dtek app for peering into your phone's security protocols. The KeyOne will work with the BES server. In addition to everyday buyers, the folks behind the BlackBerry brand are also reaching out to businesses and government agencies to support the phone.. I've never gotten into the BlackBerry Hub; for me, it was and still is information overload. But I do like BlackBerry's take on the look and feel of its software -- it makes it seem like a distinctly BlackBerry device that happens to run Android. You see elements of this in the square layout of your recent apps (when you tap the Recents button) and a bubble you see floating on the screen when you tap out of the dialer during a call. You just tap it again to get back to the dialer..

With its excellent hardware keyboard, BlackBerry's Android-powered KeyOne phone is a messaging marvel for a niche audience.. There's nothing else like the unlocked BlackBerry KeyOne ($549). It's the first practical, well-functioning keyboarded smartphone we've seen since the BlackBerry Classic. It meets the most important milestone: The KeyOne works the way you expect and want it to, without weird software or hardware compromises. For some people, it'll be like coming home.. What you think about the KeyOne rides entirely on something that can't be measured through tests or benchmarks: It's whether you've moved on from hardware keyboards. Long ago, I wrote about why I hate touch screens , and those arguments still make sense: we're still physical creatures with five senses, and touch screens blind one of them. As screens have gotten bigger and interfaces faster, I find that I'm better on the Samsung Galaxy S7 's touch-screen keyboard than on the KeyOne's hardware keyboard. The KeyOne is for people who haven't or don't want to—and it will make them very happy.. So yeah, let's talk about touch. TCL, which makes this phone for BlackBerry, gets the build and feel right in a way that BlackBerry didn't with the Priv , which was the size of a small boat and felt dangerously overbalanced when you slid down the keyboard.. Priorities here are very, very different from those of a status symbol phone like the Samsung Galaxy S8. The KeyOne has a solid heft to it and a textured, grippy back. It'll stay in your hand, and it's well-balanced so when you shift your hand to focus on the keyboard, it doesn't feel like it's going to tip over. It's big at 5.8 by 2.8 by 0.4 inches (HWD) and a hefty 6.3 ounces, but if you have big hands, you'll have no problem texting with just one of them on the QWERTY keyboard.. View All 9 Photos in Gallery. As far as design goes, it's just such a...BlackBerry look. The four-row keyboard is black and shiny, with metal frets that harken back to the BlackBerry Bold. On top of that, there's a 4.5-inch, portrait-style 1,620-by-1,080 LCD that's sharp (433ppi), but not intensely bright. The layout didn't create trouble for third-party apps, although games meant to run in landscape mode will feel awkward because of the physical design of the phone.. Next to the volume buttons on the side, there's an action key that defaults to opening the Messaging Hub, because with a BlackBerry, you should never be more than one key press away from messaging.. The physical keyboard is full of cool tricks. The fingerprint scanner is in the spacebar. It's fast and accurate, and it's very easy to unlock the phone using it. The keyboard is also touch-sensitive, so you can use it as a cursor pad by swiping back and forth on it, and you can put shortcuts on every single key. Unfortunately, they only work on the home screen, but set it up properly, and you'll never have to use the Android app drawer again. After two days, I had all of my top 10 apps on keyboard shortcuts.. The primary camera on the back has a bit of a protruding metal ring around it, but that doesn't destabilize the phone on a table. The KeyOne also has both a standard headphone jack (on top) and a USB-C port (on the bottom.). The KeyOne is initially being sold for $549 as an unlocked phone , although Sprint has said it'll sell it in the future. There are two versions: one that works better on AT&T and Canadian carriers, and one that works on all four US carriers, but is best on Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. The KeyOne's Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor uses the category 7, X9 modem, with peak LTE speeds of 300Mbps — that may sound fast, but it gets slower network performance than higher-end devices.. In my experience using the KeyOne on T-Mobile for four days, its connectivity isn't quite on par with the Galaxy S7. For instance, as I zipped in and out of dead zones in the New York City subway, the KeyOne would take longer to recover from the dead zones than an S7 on T-Mobile does. But that's to be expected: the S7 and S8 both have 4x4 MIMO, an antenna technology that really squeezes the best out of weaker signals. If you're coming from an iPhone, on the other hand, you won't notice a difference.. BlackBerry has always made good voice phones, with a focus on clarity rather than sheer volume. That's my experience with the KeyOne as well: a sharp, clear earpiece and a very good speakerphone. The speaker port is on the bottom, so it will work well on a conference table. Speakerphone volume is ideal for indoor use. Outdoors, it doesn't quite kick up to construction-worksite levels.. Dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi, GPS, NFC for Android Pay, and an FM radio are all on board as well. I have no performance complaints with any of those.. The phone also has Bluetooth 4.2, which was the most current version until Samsung included Bluetooth 5.0 on the Galaxy S8. I used the KeyOne with a Plantronics Voyager Focus UC headset and got consistent, clear connections.. The KeyOne runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat on a 2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor with 3GB of RAM. Android here has been heavily overlaid with a new launcher and custom apps, most notably BlackBerry's Messaging Hub and DTEK security monitoring software. BlackBerry has made a pledge to push out Android's monthly security updates quickly, although there's no similar pledge for feature updates, such as the upcoming Android O .. BlackBerry's Hub is the company's signature app, a unified messaging solution that draws in email , texting, Facebook, Twitter, and Slack (but not Google Hangouts). If the BlackBerry Classic was built for the Hub and then had Android apps bolted on, the KeyOne is built for Android apps and has the Hub bolted on.. You want to use the Hub. Not only does it unite all of your notifications in a really convenient way (although it hands off to individual apps to write new messages, in some cases), it has a drawer that pops out from the right side of the screen to let you manage your latest emails and calendar appointments. I'm a heavy Gmail user, and the only downside I can find is that it doesn't do the auto-sorting that the real Gmail app does, shunting mailing lists over onto a "promotions" tab so you don't have to triage them.. See How We Test Cell Phones. But it's obvious the Hub is a bolt-on: When you're using it, you have to go through and mute notifications for Messages, Messenger, and other default apps so you don't get duplicate sets of notifications. The Snapdragon 625 gets benchmark scores similar to a quality lower-end phone like the Moto G5 Plus , or about half the score you see on a current flagship phone. Graphics benchmark scores are especially brutal, at a mere 11 frames per second in the GFXBench Manhattan test, which is half or a third of the frame rate you get on other high-end devices. I also experienced lag when zipping through the UI. This is clearly not a gaming phone; it's a messaging phone.. TCL says it chose the 625 for battery life, and combined with a 3,505mAh (non-removable) cell, battery life is just terrific. I easily got a day and a half of regular use before sticking the phone on a charger. It's better than the iPhone or the latest Galaxies, that's for sure.. The 32GB KeyOne has 22.1GB of storage available, plus a slot that fits microSD cards up to 256GB.. The phone has an 8-megapixel front camera and a 12-megapixel main camera. The front camera is capable of 1080p video at 30 frames per second, and the main camera is capable of either 4K video at 30 frames per second, or 1080p at 60 frames per second.. BlackBerry's camera app gets points for putting exposure compensation on the screen by default, and enabling a flexible manual mode. But the cameras themselves are just middling. The main sensor works very well in good light, taking subdued but very clear photos and 4K video at 30fps. You want to keep the video resolution at 1080p, though, because those 4K videos can be shaky; knocking down the resolution allows for stabilization.. The camera does a good job collecting images if held very still, but it pushes the virtual shutter speed low enough to create blur and indistinctness. You'll want to use the powerful flash in dim light.. The front-facing camera is all-around disappointing. It got blurry even in cloudy outdoor conditions, and low light kept pushing the video mode to lower and lower frame rates —it got as low as 8fps in a mostly darkened room. This camera isn't for Snapchatting at the club, that's for sure.. The phone also isn't designed ideally for video playback — no portrait-style, keyboarded phone is. Videos end up with big black bars above and below, and if you turn the phone into landscape mode, it's slightly unbalanced because of the keyboard on the side. That's a price you pay for the messaging focus.. TCL keeps the faith with the BlackBerry KeyOne, and the faithful shall be rewarded. Using this phone for five days, I kept thinking, "I could stick with this." Words are my thing, after all, and this phone really prioritizes them. But then I realized I've moved on, and I personally prefer the Galaxy S8's superior camera and always-on display.. But it's okay if you haven't moved on. The KeyOne doesn't force you to make the painful compromises the Classic and Priv did: It's a mainstream Android phone running all of the latest apps, and it doesn't feel like it weighs a pound and a half. TCL and BlackBerry thought a lot about people who want to have their fingers on the keyboard of life, and you can benefit from that thoughtfulness. Bottom Line: With its excellent hardware keyboard, BlackBerry's Android-powered KeyOne phone is a messaging marvel for a niche audience..

The physical Smart Keyboard mimics the heritage of the BlackBerry trackpad by responding to touch gestures, making web browsing, reading, and writing with flick typing a much easier and more intuitive experience. The keyboard also can be easily programmed to launch up to 52 customizable shortcuts, such as pressing “I” for your inbox or “M” to access maps. In addition, KEYone is the first smartphone to build a fingerprint sensor directly into the keyboard spacebar for added functionality and security.. Back in September last year, we announced our transition from developing handset hardware internally, to licensing third-party partners so that we could focus on putting the “smart” in the phone and other devices. It was a key step in our transformation from a device manufacturer. While BlackBerry began the journey of bringing the strong history of our iconic keyboard-based devices into the Android generation, TCL Communication picked up the mantle and will bring KEYone to market as the first smartphone announced under our newly-signed licensing agreement – and we couldn’t be more excited about it. Our smartphone licensees – TCL, BB Merah Putih, and Optiemus Infracom – take over responsibility for ongoing device development, marketing, and distribution, while we provide security and the BlackBerry experience.. We’re very confident that customers of all stripes, whether they’re on #TeamBlackBerry, Android loyalists, or anyone who values mobile security and productivity, are going to LOVE KEYone (which will sell at or under €599 EUR/£499 GBP/$549 USD once it becomes available in April). Built on the world’s most secure Android software platform (based on Android 7.1 Nougat), KEYone will deliver features curated for the modern user, including:. Ultimately, KEYone pairs the best of BlackBerry software and security with TCL’s commitment to delivering high-quality, reliable smartphones to markets around the world. And we are very enthusiastic about how our long-term partnerships with TCL and our other partners, BB Merah Putih in Indonesia and Optiemus for the Indian sub-continent, will ensure availability of BlackBerry-branded smartphones to every corner of the world .. The Next Web gets it: it calls KEYone a “gorgeous and affordable productivity-focused smartphone,”. while The Verge says KEYone “resurrects the keyboard with style.”. As we’ve previously announced, BlackBerry is now focused on software innovation – aka “putting the smart in the phone” (and the computer, cars, the Internet of Things, and all other endpoints) – and we’re excited to see TCL bring to market a high-quality BlackBerry device that customers expect our brand to deliver.. Our transformation from a device maker into an enterprise software company has not only created a stronger BlackBerry , but has also enabled our partners to grow their markets. It’s also expanded the availability of security-focused mobile devices that users have come to know and trust from BlackBerry. Besides smartphones, our licensing program includes our industrial design expertise and vast trove of intellectual property, and will expand to additional mobile devices, such as tablets, as well as other products that make up the Enterprise of Things, all of which require the secure, mobile connectivity that BlackBerry is well-known for. In a world with growing numbers of devices and mobile threats to our overall security, giving more people confidence in the security of their devices is the most important factor of all..

Qualcomm Snapdragon 625. mAh Li-Ion non-removable battery. Multi-touch touchscreen , physical keyboard with touchpad. 12 MP with f/2.0 aperture, 4K video capture, HDR , phase detection autofocus, EIS. 8 MP, 1080p video capture. JerryRigEverything Durability Test (YouTube video). Original: Android 7.1 "Nougat". 1620x1080 pixels , 434 ppi. Wi-Fi : ( 802.11 a / b / g / n / ac ). The BlackBerry KEYone is a touchscreen -based Android smartphone with a physical QWERTY keyboard that is manufactured by TCL Corporation under the brand name of BlackBerry Mobile. Originally known by its unofficial code name " Mercury ", [1] the KEYone was officially announced at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on February 25, 2017. [2] While there were BlackBerry smartphones running Android before, the KEYone is the first Android-based BlackBerry with the iconic BlackBerry design (having a QWERTY keyboard below the screen and not being a slider phone like the Priv).. KEYone battery projection showing an estimated 59 total hours of life on a single charge. The KEYone features a larger battery capacity than most similar Android smartphones.. The first sale units of the BlackBerry KEYone came pre-loaded with Android 7.1 Nougat, and the BlackBerry Hub and DTEK applications were also preinstalled. [3] It is powered by a 3505 mAh battery and an octa-core, Snapdragon 625 processor , 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage. [4] The hardware has been designed by the Chinese TCL Corporation. [5] It was released in India on 1 August 2017, in a special Limited Edition Black color, and some changes to the specifications, including 4 GB RAM + 64 GB storage, instead of the 3 GB RAM + 32 GB storage international version. The Indian version also features a dual-sim slot, which they claim is the 'first BlackBerry smartphone with dual-sim support', [6] although the BlackBerry Aurora in Indonesia has that title.. The phone measures 149.1 x 72.4 x 9.4 mm (4.5 inches). Its case is made of a silver aluminum frame, with a black rubbery grip in the back. [4] The top of the phone features a headphone jack. [7] The bottom of the phone features an USB-C port and a mono speaker. [4] The phone also features a fully touch-enabled QWERTY physical keyboard which doubles as a trackpad, a fingerprint scanner located in the spacebar, and key-shortcuts facility to speed up the launching of most features. The phone features a 3:2, IPS screen at 1080x1620 pixels, with a pixel density of 434ppi. [4] [8] The phone possesses two cameras: one 8-megapixel at the front and a Sony IMX378, 12-megapixel at the rear. The rear camera can record 4K videos at 30 fps. [9] The front camera can record 1080p videos at 30 frames per seconds. [10] The phone can shoot pictures in 3:2 by default (the screen's ratio) or in the standard 4:3. [4] It also features EIS and phase-detection autofocus. In September 2017, TCL Communications worked with AT&T Mobility to make an AT&T-exclusive version of the KEYone, the BlackBerry KEYone Space Black. The device contains the same specifications of the as the original device, but shares the same colors as the Limited Edition Black. [12] The device will only be available in the United States.. In India, however, Blackberry has launched an upgraded variant, called the Blackberry KEYone Limited Edition. Unlike the regular KEYone model, the Limited Edition has 4GB RAM and 64GB internal memory and it comes with dual sim card support. Blackberry also offered a 1 Year Free Screen Replacement guarantee on the Blackberry KEYone Limited Edition via OnlyMobiles.com. On November 16th, 2017, BB Merah Putih announced that the BlackBerry KEYone will be joining their BlackBerry lineup, alongside their BlackBerry Aurora. The device, like the Indian model, will be branded under Limited Edition Black title. [14] A live event was held on November 23rd. The device is sold in Indonesia through Dino Market. The KEYone originally shipped with Android 7.1 "Nougat," but will be updated to Android 8.0 "Oreo." [16] BlackBerry has promised to provide system security updates for the phone once per month, [17] which contributed to the phone earning official Android Enterprise Recommended status from Google. ^ Heater, Brian (2017-05-04).

Tags: none ( add ). Today, I visited the Blackberry website to see where can I get the newest Blackberry KEYone phone and was surprised to see that starting tomorrow September 1st; AT&T is exclusively will be launching a Blackberry Space Black KEYone version. The silver original color is already available through Sprint.. Ok, with that being said if or when will Verizon carry this model? I have been a loyal Blackberry user for over two decades and am not interested in any other manufacturer. My charger port is not holding the charger cord in properly, I called Asurion for a replacement and was told that they do not carry any Blackberry phones because they were discontinued. I was miffed because I knew that Blackberry still manufactured phone like this Keyone. The representative tried to convince me that Blackberry is out of business...... I said to her that if they were out of business then their website would have said so and that they will not be having phones for sale. She told me that they could only offer me some Motorola phones or I can call Verizonwireless to get a Blackberry phone because there wasn't anything they can do. I was very frustrated and had said that if I'm paying you a monthly fee for service; you should be able to service me with a device that is comparable to what I currently have and a Motorola which is android is not comparable to my Blackberry and what it can do and secure. She just kept saying that all they can do for me and transferred me to a Verizon rep. A long story short, Asurion was willing to reimburse me for another Verizon Blackberry phone if I had paid the retail price from Verizonwirelss and send them a copy of the receipt. After, I spoke with a manager about this ordeal, I asked him a vital question. If Verizonwireless doesn't carry any Blackberry phones, where in the WORLD would I purchase a phone from. If that was just the stupidest solution I told him; obviously you must think that I'm incompetent. So, I asked to be transferred to Blackberry. I spoke with the rep and she told me that the phones were only available from Amazon or Best Buy at this time. I looked on both websites and they are not available.. So, Will Verizon carry this model or will l have to breakup a two decade wireless carrier relationship and move to AT&T. I do have them as a bundle package and have been avoiding the daily advertisements to add a wireless service and save more $$$$$. I have the same question Show 0 Likes (0).

The (silver) BlackBerry Keyone model unlocked & compatible with the Verizon network has been sold for 3 months now, but only directly from Best Buy & Amazon.. The availability has been somewhat sporadic due to sales and issues with the screen hardware separating from the device and software fixes. As of today Amazon shows the Verizon compatible version as out of stock but it is available at Best Buy's for order and shipping again.. The KeyOne isn't made by BlackBerry, as BlackBerry doesn't manufacture devices or hardware since their company restructuring. BlackBerry does make software offer design licensing for products.. The KeyOne is an Android device made by TCL, a Chinese electronics company. They licensed the BlackBerry keyboard design for the phone which is why the model carries the name. 'BlackBerry' devices released since the end of 2015 have been running the Android operating system as the BlackBerry OS like on your Z30 had been retired.. ( in response to deloused ). Like Show 0 Likes (0). Hello, Thank you so much for the clarity of the new Blackberry KeyOne. I had no idea that it was not a Blackberry made phone but was told by a Blackberry representative that it was..... If the KeyOne provides the same security measures as the other Blackberry devices than I will be pacified for now. This will make me have to learn the trick and trades of an Android.. ( in response to Magees ). Like Show 0 Likes (0). Blackberry has licensed their phones to TCL.. I am a loyal Blackberry user also and I am getting frustrated.. Amazon and Best Buy have a Verizon compatible version, I just don't want to shell out $549.00 at the moment.. It would be nice if Verizon hooked up a payment plan with Best Buy.. ( in response to Magees ). Like Show 0 Likes (0). Since the KEYone is only made with GSM radio chip set - (NOT CDMA compatible), I doubt Verizon will carry until they have TCL design a version with CDMA capabilities. is it six months or 18 months after the launch of the GSM version, which is compatible on AT&T and T-Mobile networks as well as international networks across the pond. Guess I will be dropping Verizon after a good run of 15 years.. ( in response to Magees ). Like Show 0 Likes (0). The KeyOne is available in both GSM and CDMA from Best Buy for US $549, and is unlocked, so it can be used on mulitiple carriers, includeing Verizon (CDMA). The hardware is made by TCL. The OS is Android, but many Blackberry apps are preloaded, such as Hub and BB keyboard. It runs the DTEK security software.. ( in response to Magees ). Like Show 1 Likes (1). I've been using the unlocked CDMA version of the Blackberry Keyone since day one and it has been a great phone. I'm also a 20-year veteran of Blackberry devices and this is the best one yet.. There is a very short learning curve to adapt to Android, but the BB hub is there as you are accustomed to.. I have set up the phone to have the same notification tones and same functionality as my previous BB devices.. The keyboard is excellent (it feels better to me than the Q10 I most recently used) and the device is well made - so it does not matter to me whether it was manufactured by TCL or Blackberry itself.. I have had no screen separation issues as some other early adopters have noted. Any Keyones that you buy today would have had the extra adhesive that TCL claimed to use after first identifying potential separation issues in limited devicesI am not a big user of apps, but it is nice to have access to a handful of ones I find useful and that were not available or didn't work well under the BB operating system. The camera is a big step ahead over past BB devices as well... Battery life has been a pleasant surprise - i typically show 3-4 days of battery life remaining, but I do not leave wifi, bluetooth, or location services turned on when I am not using them, so your mileage may vary (right now my battery meter shows that it was charged 23 hours ago and has three days remaining).. ( in response to Magees ). Like Show 0 Likes (0). When I was checking out the specs on the blackberry website, it had 2 version i was looking at. the BBB100-1 (GSM version) and BBB100-3 (Verizon version).. When I received my phone was that it just wasn't working for the first hour or two. After couple of resets, it worked.. When I went to the phone settings > about, this is what I noticed - the model is BBB100-1, not BBB100-3. Is this to say that the BBB100-1 will work with Verizon or that the BBB100-1 is basically the GSM version with CDMA built into it and they're just not stating it?. Let me know what model phone you have! Thanks!. ( in response to GRELAW59 ). Like Show 0 Likes (0). Can you check the model of your phone and let me know if it's the BBB100-1 or the BBB100-3 (Settings > About Phone) Thanks!. ( in response to travietime ). Like Show 0 Likes (0).

BlackBerry KEYone Review - Pushes All The Right Buttons. Ironically, it took not BlackBerry to make a BlackBerry Smartphone that pushes all the right buttons. The KEYone by BlackBerry Mobile (TCL) merges the best of the classic BlackBerry experience with Android Nougat in a package that is undeniably and distinctly BlackBerry.. A New Era of BlackBerry Smartphones. The KEYone got me out of CrackBerry retirement and using a BlackBerry Smartphone again (and loving it!). I have no shortage of phones at my disposal and can reach for an iPhone or Google Pixel or Samsung Galaxy whenever I want. Since picking up the KEYone, I've never felt that urge. What more can be said than that? With battery life that will last you all day and night (and well into the next day) and a smart physical keyboard that makes typing on buttons feel new school again, it's a communication-centric phone that power users will love.. Fingerprint Sensor in Spacebar is Magic. Android brings with it all the apps. Battery life so good, mention it twice! In the photo above that 24% at 4:07pm is on Day 2!. 32GB of memory OK; would gladly pay for 64GB or 128GB. 3GB of RAM OK; a 4th GB may improve zippiness under heavy load. LCD display is really good; OLED could be epic. Integrate BlackBerry Launcher settings like keyboard shortcuts into System settings. Add wireless charging (even though you don't need it). Love to see it in more colors down the road. No, they don't make smartphones anymore. Yes, there are still BlackBerry Smartphones being made and will be for a long time to come. You can read this article to clear up the confusion and listen to this podcast if you really want the full explanation. The long story short is that the company known as BlackBerry , who patented push email and helped pioneer the smartphone industry over 15 years ago is now a software company.. The BlackBerry brand to most of us on planet earth, more than software is better known for hardware, specifically BlackBerry Smartphones. So to ensure BlackBerry Smartphones continue for the long haul, BlackBerry has entered into licensing agreements with select manufacturing partners to design, build, market and support BlackBerry Smartphones. The biggest licensee is TCL Communication, and under the brand BlackBerry Mobile the KEYone is the first BlackBerry Smartphone they are bringing to market.. While BlackBerry supports BlackBerry Mobile in the software and security hardening of the KEYone, it's important to know that this really is a BlackBerry Smartphone being brought to market by another company altogether. Their website is www.blackberrymobile.com (not blackberry.com), you can find them on Instagram , Facebook , Twitter and YouTube under the handles @blackberrymobile or @bbmobile.. BlackBerry Mobile is really being built up as a new team and organization and beyond the KEYone they are committed to bringing more Android-powered BlackBerry Smartphones to market (sorry BlackBerry 10 fans, but that ship has sailed). The KEYone is exciting first phone, and it'll be exciting to see what they offer next.. I (CrackBerry Kevin) have been super lucky to have been using the KEYone for over two months now, since it was first announced at Mobile World Congress. I first went hands-on with the KEYone in January in Las Vegas at CES, and liked the pre-production unit so much that I came out of BlackBerry retirement in February to celebrate CrackBerry's 10th Anniversary .. As part of the celebrations, I even had the honor to get up on stage and help officially unveil the BlackBerry KEYone to the world as MC for the launch event. The KEYone units I've had in my possession to date, including my official review unit, are considered pre-production and have still been receiving software updates - that said, my experiences with the KEYone have been super solid throughout - the one you buy should be even better.. Disclosure: In case you didn't figure it out from the BlackBerry KEYone ads on the CrackBerry, BlackBerry Mobile is an advertising partner with CrackBerry (we often see manufacturers buy advertising for their phones across Mobile Nations sites). You can read here for more info on that if you like.. Why read when you can watch a video? In 13 Minutes I highlight what I love and what can be improved on the KEYone. I think the video does a good job of laying out the real value proposition for the KEYone - this is a phone for power communicators who like a physical keyboard (and those people are going to LOVE it).. USB-C, Quick Charge 3.0 + boost charging. With a name like KEYone, the physical keyboard is clearly the primary story of this phone. When as a phone manufacturer, or as customer, you choose to sacrifice the amount of real estate dedicated to the display to instead have a keyboard there that's always present, you're making a distinct choice to build a phone that's more communication-centric vs. The design of the KEYone is such that you don't feel like you're making a compromise at all. Compared to older QWERTY BlackBerry designs of the past, like the BlackBerry Bold 9900 or even the newer BlackBerry Classic , the KEYone's 4.5" display with 3:2 aspect ratio in portrait orientation feels positively huge. Compared to other popular devices like the standard-sized iPhone 7, Galaxy S7/S8 or Google Pixel, they KEYone's display feels relatively on par. And even compared to large screen devices like the iPhone 7 Plus or Google Pixel XL, which were the two phones I was actively using before upgrading to the KEYone, moving over to the KEYone was easy - I've never yet felt in all my time with the KEYone that the display feels small.. It's a surprising form factor to look at when you first see it -- and photos don't do it justice -- you really need to see the KEYone in person and hold it in your hand to truly appreciate it, but the "form factor" truly works. That the KEYone looks and feels so incredibly premium makes the overall design work that much more. I could see this general device ID working for years to come - I wouldn't be surprised if the KEYtwo (if and when released) would feature a similar hardware design. When you get it right, you get it right.. If you were concerned that not BlackBerry making a BlackBerry Smartphone could result in a phone that feels unBlackBerry-like, those fears are eliminated the moment you pick up the KEYone.. If you were concerned that not BlackBerry making a BlackBerry Smartphone could result in a phone that feels unBlackBerry-like, those fears are eliminated the moment you pick up the KEYone. Clearly, the KEYone looks like a BlackBerry. From the front, the back, the sides, the device is unmistakably a BlackBerry. More importantly though, is the feel of the phone. At 180 grams, the KEYone is a dense phone, in a good way. Picking it up, it has that heft you'd associate with something like an expensive mechanical watch strapped on your wrist. The sizeable battery and BlackBerry's choice of metal frame contribute to the weight and the soft touch rubber backside make it a phone that's comfortable to hold and is easy to grip. The KEYone belongs in your hand.. I find it magical how BlackBerry continues to pack more and more technology into the physical keyboard. It used to be that programmable shortcuts were the one smart feature of a QWERTY phone like the KEYone. Being able to map dialing contacts or opening apps to the push of a button was the additional benefit beyond the accuracy provided by pressing buttons vs. And the KEYone does offer plenty of shortcuts - up to 52 to thanks to the ability to distinguish between short press and long press actions, where one button can now serve as two shortcuts. The shortcuts are getting smarter too. For example, pressing H (for home) can open up the maps app with your home location already programmed in. The KEYone's keyboard is touch capacitive. Beyond pressing buttons you can actually flick auto-suggested words up onto the display while typing. You can also use the keyboard as trackpad, thumb scrolling your way through your inbox, feeds or webpages. This is an innovation that was first introduced on the BlackBerry Passport and also featured on the BlackBerry Priv and I'm happy to see it on the KEYone. We now live in a smartphone world where far more people have experienced a touchscreen smartphone than a phone with physical buttons and most people don't know a keyboard can work this way - whenever I give a demo of the KEYone to someone who is unfamiliar, swiping on the keyboard blows them away. If typing on buttons could be considered old school in 2017, the ability to swipe on the keyboard makes it it feel new school again.. The newest innovation to the keyboard which is unique to the KEYone, is the implementation of a fingerprint sensor in the space bar of the keyboard. This feature allows you to unlock your phone with your fingerprint. It works incredibly well. There's even the surprise flourish of a tiny LED light on either side of the spacebar that will light up to prompt you to use your fingerprint. I've been really happy overall with the typing experience on the KEYone. I've mainly been on touchscreen smartphones the past few years, so it took me a couple days to get used to typing with buttons again and a couple more days to fall in love with it, but I've been rocking the buttons hard ever since and loving it. There are many areas where typing with buttons trumps typing on glass - be sure to check out this video where I dive into the details.. As for the typing experience itself, I'd rank the KEYone's keyboard right up there among my BlackBerry keyboard favorites. The Bold 9900 still ranks supreme as the best physical keyboard ever built for typing experience, but the KEYone isn't too far behind. The buttons have a good feel and bounce rate when pressed, and there's a nice roll to the buttons as you move your thumbs left and right over them which helps your thumbs dance with rhythm as you type. The keyboard is compact without being too tight, which makes the keyboard efficient to use. I know many BlackBerry Passport users love that device's ultra-wide three row keyboard setup. Personally, while comfortable thanks to the wide grip I always found it a bit inefficient to use because you have to move your thumbs so far for every key press. To me, the ultimate compromise is a keyboard that is small but big enough that you can find and press the buttons accurately. And the KEYone delivers on this well. Based on photos I was initially concerned that the KEYone may feel top heavy while typing, since the display is so tall and the keyboard is mounted quite low on the phone. In use, I've never felt an issue here - it's easy to grip and type on the phone.. All Day, All Night (and then some) Battery Life. Bottom line, if you like a physical keyboard on your smartphone phone, you're going to quickly grow to love the KEYone's keyboard.. This is the killer feature of the BlackBerry KEYone. If you haven't yet, be sure to watch my BlackBerry KEYone review video which is effectively a gush fest for the KEYone's battery life.. BlackBerry packed a LARGE 3505mAh battery into the KEYone, which is the biggest battery ever put into a BlackBerry and is large by any standard. Combined with BlackBerry's choice of energy-efficient Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 chipset and you have battery life that's tough to kill before you go to bed. It really is an all day, all night and good chunk of the next day battery, even under HEAVY use.. With the KEYone, you're never going to get stranded with a dead battery.. It doesn't matter what features or specs a phone has, if the battery is dead it's a paperweight. With the KEYone, you're never going to get stranded with a dead battery. There's no need to subconsciously throttle back your device usage to get you through the day either. You can do whatever you want on the KEYone all day long and it's going to take it and you'll still have juice in the tank when you go to bed.. I've been traveling a lot in 2017 and I've always found roaming to be typically hard on batteries (coupled with the fact you end up using your phone more for things like Google Maps, don't have WiFi locations saved, etc.). Even in these demanding situations the KEYone battery lives up. I guarantee every review you read about the KEYone is going to highlight the battery life of the phone. If you ever do need to recharge during the day, the KEYone features Quick Charge 3.0 technology and prompts you to select Boost Mode when you plug it in which enables charging up to 50% in 36 minutes. In over two months, I've never needed to use - the battery outlasts me and I plug it into charge at night.. Over my years of reviewing BlackBerry Smartphones, I've always glossed over the camera section of the review. BlackBerry has never had a great reputation for taking amazing photos.. The KEYone changes that with a camera capable of snapping glorious photos. If you check out @crackberrykevin , or better yet, @blackberrymobile on Instagram, you'll find plenty of examples of #ShotOnKEYone photos that will turn your head.. Saw a poll on @mobilesyrup asking Canadians what smartphone they're buying next - @blackberrymobile #KEYone won by a landslide and received more votes than #GalaxyS8 and #iPhone combined! 🇨🇦. A post shared by CrackBerry Kevin (@crackberrykevin) on May 2, 2017 at 11:57am PDT. The KEYone shares the same 12 megapixel Sony IMX378 sensor that is used in the Google Pixel which receives a lot of rave reviews for its camera. It lacks the electronic optical stabilization goodness of the Pixel while recording video (it's really amazingly smooth on the Pixel), but overall takes really nice photos. In outdoor or optimal lighting situations it's fantastic. In low light it's pretty good - there's some room for improvement here compared to the best low light smartphone cameras out there, but again, for a communication-centric device BlackBerry Mobile did damn good on the KEYone's camera, and I can see it improving overtime with continued software rollouts.. #BlackBerry #Android #BlackBerryMobile #Smartphone #Camera #KEYone. A post shared by BlackBerry Mobile (@blackberrymobile) on Apr 19, 2017 at 12:52pm PDT. The camera app itself is very powerful and easy to use. There is a Pro mode available, so if you know how to take photos you can squeeze every micron of goodness out of the sensor. I'm not that guy though, so I mainly leave the KEYone in auto mode. There are filters you can apply to the camera before you take the photo. With no filter enabled, the colors are quite accurate, if not a little more natural/cooler than compared to the default camera settings on phones like the iPhone, Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel. If you enable the Vivid filter, the colors will get a little more punched up to be more like these three phones. I usually just leave the camera with no filter, but if I'm looking for that better than real life shot, then I enable the Vivid filter.. As for front facing camera, the 8 megapixel sensor does a good job with selfies - that you can tap the spacebar to snap the photo is a nice touch that helps improve your selfie game when your arm is stretched to the max.. For many years, the smartphone race was just that… a race to see who would build the best smartphone, cramming in the latest specs and claiming the title for a few weeks or months until the next competitor crammed even more cutting edge specs in. The smartphone industry is now much more like the automotive industry. It's not about who can build the best vehicle at any expense, but what's the best vehicle for your needs - do you want a $100,000 sports car to rip around in and rack up speeding tickets that runs out of gas in a hurry, or do you need a $35,000 mini-van that can haul the family around to soccer practice back and forth with as minimal trips to the gas station as possible?. With the KEYone, BlackBerry very intentionally picked the specs and hardware components they wanted in this phone based on the target user fitting this power communicator persona. When it comes to chipset, battery size, screen size, and camera, they made all the right choices to deliver a compelling experience for this type of user. This means the KEYone won't be dated in three months - this is a phone that's going to have a long shelf life to it.. Outside of the key hardware specs already highlighted, everything in the KEYone has met or exceeded my expectations through normal use.. The 4.5" LCD display is bright and vibrant, with a pixel density of 443 pixels per inch. The 3:2 aspect ratio means you'll lose a little bit of screen real estate while watching videos in landscape, but it's minimal. Again, if you want a media-centric phone the KEYone may not be for you, but as a phone that puts the priority on communications first this is a tiny compromise compared to the benefits of the design. With their deep blacks and vibrant colors, I do personally love OLED displays - I would put this on my wishlist for the KEYtwo, but overall I have zero complaints about the display.. Many of the BlackBerry faithful were hoping for "stereo speakers" to be present on the KEYone. It doesn't have that, but rather a single downward facing mono speaker. I don't listen to music much on my KEYone, or any smartphone for that matter (tiny smartphone speakers are never going to cut the mustard for my ears). When I do listen to music from my phone it's typically connected to a bluetooth speaker like a UE Boom , my Bose Earbuds or powering my home's Sonos setup, or better yet when I'm putting my audiophile game on I'm plugged into my wired headphones from B&O or Master & Dynamic (yes, the KEYone does have a 3.5 headset jack!). That said, the speaker performance has been pretty solid for when I do watch the odd YouTube video or take calls on speakerphone. Overall telephony and communications with the KEYone have been solid with my time thus far on the KEYone. Calls are crisp whether on the handset or through bluetooth connected in my car (Tesla Model S) and I've had solid bluetooth performance with the variety of bluetooth devices I've used the KEYone with.. I know I'm hardcore teasing with this photo, but the KEYone looks so good mounted in the Tesla I just had to post! :) #blackberry #blackberrymobile #blackberryKEYone #tesla.

The KEYone comes with a 32GB of storage memory and an expandable microSD slot -- in the same tray as the SIM card -- that can handle up to an insanely large 2 terrabyte microSD card. You can't easily find microSD cards that big of course (and I'm assuming they'd probably cost more than the KEYone's $549 price tag itself), but you can pick up a 200GB SanDisk microSD card for about $75. Pretty reasonable, and it's nice to know you can pack a lot of additional storage onto the KEYone. That the Android OS system storage itself consumes nearly 10GB or the 32GB doesn't give you a ton of space if you're the type of person who has a lot of photos and videos on their phone. 32GB is by no means a deal breaker and was a smart call to help keep the KEYone's price tag down -- especially as this will be a phone that makes a lot of inroads into business and enterprises where that extra storage isn't that critical and not something businesses want to pay for if not necessary. That said, I'm the type of person who will always opt for more memory, so I'd happily pay more for the KEYone to ship with 64GB or 128GB of internal memory by default.. The final hardware features I'll mention in this review are much-loved BlackBerry specific features.. The KEYone features the programmable BlackBerry Convenience Key, which used to be ubiquitous on BlackBerry Smartphones but in more recent years disappeared from hardware. Located on the lower right side of the phone, you can customize the Convenience Key like you do a keyboard shortcut, to either open an app or complete an action like speed dialing a contact or viewing today's agenda. Given that the Hub swipe gesture is not present on the KEYone, I think a lot of BlackBerry Hub fans will find themselves setting the Convenience Key to launch the Hub, making it easily accessible regardless of what you're doing on the phone. Other favorites of mine include using it to launch Google Assistant, or to toggle and on off the KEYone's flashlight/torch functionality, for those times when you know you're heading into dark places for the and will be needing a guiding light (which apparently for me happens on a more regular basis than you may think!). When on calls, the Convenience Key also serves as a mute key (note - gone is the play/pause/mute button typically found between the volume up/down keys). It's nice to see the Convenience Key on the KEYone - it further builds into that KEYone name and it's little utility-first features like this that made me a fan of BlackBerry to begin with.. The KEYone also features the infamous LED light, which flashes when you receive notifications. The light is RGB, which in certain apps allows for the color of the light to be customized. To be honest, this feature was one of my favorite features in my early days of BlackBerry, because back then I only received emails or text messages (and the occasional BBM). In 2017, we're so connected and message so much that I have to disable the LED or it would just be constantly. That said, I still love that it's there. Without it, it wouldn't be a BlackBerry!. The BlackBerry KEYone runs Android Nougat, the latest available version of the Android operating system. While many long-term remaining BlackBerry fans would prefer the KEYone run BlackBerry 10, going Android makes the KEYone a far more appealing device to me and many other former and never owned a BlackBerry users.. Most former BlackBerry users, myself included, left BlackBerry due to a lack of apps, or at the least were forced to carry a second iOS or Android phone with them in order to have all the apps they needed or wanted.. The adoption of Android by BlackBerry immediately solved this decade-long app problem that plagued BlackBerry. With the KEYone, I'm back to being a BlackBerry user and not needing to lug around a second device.. I refer to my colleagues at Android Central for their expertise on Android, and they agree BlackBerry has a done a good job of leaving the Android Operating system fairly stock while through the BlackBerry launcher adding in features that truly add value while making the experience more BlackBerry-like. From an Android user perspective, one of my favorite features of the BlackBerry Launcher is that they put the the notification badge (aka the BlackBerry "Spark" or "Splat" on) onto the application icon. Stock Android doesn't do this and it drives me nuts. The BlackBerry Launcher also allows for icon packs to be swapped in and out, so if you want a different look you can modify that without losing functionality. Keyboard shortcuts on the KEYone are tied to the BlackBerry Launcher app though, so if you are an Android tweaker and want to use a different Android launcher altogether on the KEYone you are going to lose some of that functionality.. The KEYone comes pre-loaded with many of BlackBerry's apps, including the BlackBerry Hub and DTEK. The Hub is BlackBerry's unified inbox on steroids, which allows you to pretty much connect all of your email, messaging and social accounts to it so all your communications are in one stream. DTEK is BlackBerry's security app, which gives you insight into how locked down (or not) your KEYone is. Now that BlackBerry BlackBerry (not BlackBerry Mobile) is a software company, you're starting to see them ramp up their efforts in app development. BlackBerry Notable is a new app that allows you to mark up screen captures with ease, and Privacy Shade allows you to get your James Bond, blacking on your screen and only revealing content where you drag your finger.. The nice thing about Android compared to other operating systems like BlackBerry 10 or iOS is its flexibility. If you want to change something, you likely can. For example, as much as so many people love the BlackBerry Hub, I personally am not a fan of it. Between all of my communication and social accounts, I simply receive too many messages a day to want to have everything coming into one location. I use my phone in a much more compartmentalized fashion - I check email when I want to do work. I open Instagram or Twitter when I have a few minutes to kill. When it comes to text messages, I want to be notified immediately. On the KEYone, thanks to Android, I simply chose to remove the Hub altogether - something I could never do on BlackBerry 10. I like having the power to choose.. I've watched Android evolve over the years, having even reviewed here on CrackBerry the original Android-powered T-Mobile G1 , which ironically in true BlackBerry fashion had a physical keyboard and even a trackball!. Android has come a long way since those early days and with Nougat I feel like it's finally there - it's smooth, it's easy enough to figure out even if you've never used Android before and the availability of all the apps in the Google Play store make it worth any nitpicks you may come across (and again, the general flexibility of Android means you can probably fix anything that bugs you if you want to). We're also crushing here on CrackBerry with BlackBerry KEYone User Guides , so if you're moving over to the KEYone from BlackBerry 10 and have questions, we've got you covered.. BlackBerry is of course known for their industry leading security, and on the security front BlackBerry has Android locked down and has kept their word on staying committed to rolling out Android Security updates in a timely fashion.. Having had the KEYone since February on a pre-release model that still featured a software build from early January, I've watched the software experience improve steadily these past couple of months with every update pushed out. Even during the review period with my official KEYone review unit this past week, on the eve of this review going live a software update became available that seems to have further improved the overall speed and smoothness of the device. I expect we'll see software updates continue to rollout for the KEYone relatively often - there's a lot of new tech and functionality packed into the KEYone and I'm sure as more people log time with the KEYone they'll find more ways to optimize the experience. That said, even on my earliest pre-release build of the KEYone there were no showstoppers in the experience - I've been pretty much addicted to the experience since week 1.. My wife is the best observer as to whether or not I like a tech product and if you ask her she'll tell you how much I love the KEYone, not based on what I say or have written here, but based on the fact that since getting one that it's rarely not in my hand. To quote her, "oh, that CrackBerry guy is really back".. The BlackBerry KEYone has brought back the BlackBerry Addict in me, but it's much better than the "good 'ole days of BlackBerry" because the KEYone is such a better phone than what we used a decade ago. There's something about the KEYone experience, between the look and feel of the hardware, the physical keyboard and that insanely good battery life that just make it a phone you want to hold and use, and even when not in use I catch myself staring at it (it's so much more demanding of my eyeball's attention than a boring slab device).. As I said at the start of this review, the story of the KEYone is the physical keyboard. By default that means it's not a device for everybody, but if you're a former or current BlackBerry user and you like the benefits that a physical keyboard provides, this is the phone for you. Buy it as soon as you can. At $549 outright, it's reasonably priced for a premium feeling phone. Even for those who have never used a physical keyboard on a smartphone before, as long as they're willing to commit a week to it to learn it and get comfortable on it, I could see first timers really falling for the KEYone. I wouldn't call the KEYone a nostalgia device - it's much more than that, but there is a nostalgia factor that does feel compelling and very in right now so I wouldn't be surprised to see first time BlackBerry users on the KEYone simply because it's so distinctly different in an era where smartphones have mainly been about sameness.. Coming into 2017 I wasn't expecting to see a new BlackBerry hit the market, never mind a new BlackBerry that kicks ass and I find myself really loving, so for that I'm thankful and excited to see BlackBerry Mobile picking up on what BlackBerry no longer wanted to be in the business of doing. After a lot of years of BlackBerry heartbreak, the KEYone feels like a fresh start for a new, modern era of BlackBerry Smartphones.. View all of our BlackBerry KEYone Help and How-To Guides.

While there are some excellent mid-tier devices, I use my phone as an essential tool for several hours a day, so I can justify paying the high price for flagship phones. However, the BlackBerry KEYone keeps taking my primary SIM and has proven to be an extremely productive device with very few tradeoffs -- while being priced at a reasonable $550, hundreds less than flagships from Samsung and Apple.. My initial experiences focused on the excellent QWERTY keyboard and it continues to impress me with its capability. However, the entire package is proving to be compelling with BlackBerry Hub's efficient communications management, a solid camera experience, stunning battery life, timely software and security updates, and a unique look that stands out from the crowd.. The more I use my phones for work, the more important that battery life becomes. You can use the BlackBerry KEYone as heavily as you want and it will last into the next day. It is refreshing to just use a phone as much as you want or need and not have to worry at all about topping it off to get to the end of the day. As people use their smartphones as their primary computing device, long battery life gets to be an essential feature and the KEYone stands out from the pack.. BlackBerry Hub on Android offers a better experience for me than having Gmail and/or an Exchange client on an Android phone, with options to manage my email being a bit faster than other email clients. The ability to easily swipe through all of the messages in the Hub is also essential for efficiency. Similar to how the iPad makes work enjoyable, the BlackBerry Hub takes away some of the pain of communications with its centralized system and user interface.. I bounce around phones with fingerprint scanners on the front and on the back, but having the scanner included in the space bar where I naturally rest my thumb when using the KEYone means I am able to unlock and start using the KEYone faster than with any other phone I have used in the past couple years with fingerprint scanners.. The BlackBerry KEYone is not your typical black slab smartphone and offers innovation in its hardware keyboard and software. It feels fantastic in your hand and looks like it belongs in the office with smart looks and unique design. To be honest, the BlackBerry KEYone is one of my favorite Android devices of all time and is even more compelling with its reasonable $550 price tag.

BlackBerry KEYone review: Getting stuff done. by Jimmy Westenberg May 4, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Physical keyboard is intuitive and smart. Apps can be slow to launch. Bottom-firing speaker doesn't get very loud. 32 GB is the only storage option. The BlackBerry KEYone is a smartphone that gets stuff done. The physical keyboard is just fantastic, there are tons of useful software features on board, and it's built like a rock. While the rear-facing camera and performance could use some tweaking, this is one of the most interesting and productivity-focused phones we've ever used..

Connectivity Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n 2.4 GHz. Bluetooth 4.2 Low Energy and EDR. Dimensions and weight 149.3 x 72.5 x 9.4 mm. BlackBerry has taken many different forms over the years, the most recent being an Android smartphone manufacturer. the DTEK50 and DTEK60 Â. Now in 2017, the company is bringing something completely different to the table.. Originally known as the BlackBerry ‘Mercury’ , the KEYone is a new productivity-focused smartphone that aims to be different on both the outside and inside. a physical keyboard, solid design, and a slew of BlackBerry’s built-in security features, is KEYone right for you?. This is our full BlackBerry KEYone review.. Both Joshua Vergara and I, Jimmy Westenberg, have been testing the BlackBerry KEYone with model number BBB100-1 on build number AAK831 running Android 7.1.1 Nougat, with the April 5, 2017 security update. We’ve been testing pre-production software, so some of the software and performance issues may be fixed by the time the phone comes to market. We will update this review if anything changes.. BlackBerry returns to its roots with a design that doesnât shy away from its signature keyboard — compared to the more recent and fully-touchscreen DTEK devices and the BlackBerry Priv, the keyboard is the key feature of the KEYone. (I had to get the pun out the way).. Many of the features of this new BlackBerry forego subtlety, showing proudly their capabilities. The camera packages on the front and back are large and obvious, while the thicker aluminum body all around rocks the side buttons prominently. An array of capacitive keys sit plainly in view between the screen and the keyboard, as the backing of the device helps handling via a rubberized plastic material.. We found ourselves enamored with the unique look and feel of the brick-like KEYone. The end result is a phone that can fit under some particular descriptors — industrial, business-oriented — and, when compared to its totally touchscreen competitors, we found ourselves very enamored with the unique look and feel of the brick-like KEYone.. The rear material and the thicker body make this phone fairly comfortable to handle in one hand, but such usage is definitely not a focus of a phone rocking a physical keyboard. We will talk more extensively about the keyboard later, but just know that typing with one hand using the physical keys is about the only part of the phone that is stuck in the past.. Indeed, the pinky balancing act is basically encouraged and will be the main way of interacting with this latest BlackBerry. However, keyboard gestures help to bridge the gap, as swipes up and down or left and right can help with navigation throughout the UI and within applications. It is really nice to have oneâs finger out of the way when reading a web page or scrolling through apps like Instagram.. Capacitive keys are the preferred method of UI navigation for BlackBerry, its middle-path choice between hardware keys and the more common softkeys of current Android Nougat devices. While they are reliable, it took a bit to get used to because the key target doesnât seem to be squarely on the white icons. Instead, they felt a little bit lower of the designated area, closer to the keyboard.. These keys function the same as they would across any typical Android device, and there is no changing their behavior. It would have been nice to program the capacitive keys, gesture keyboard swipes, or even the Convenience Key to the notification dropdown, which is the only tough part of the handling experience.. The Convenience Key is, you know, convenient. TCLâs influence is plainly seen in the inclusion of the Convenience Key, a facet of its more recent Alcatel smartphones. Though keyboard shortcuts may become the main way of opening applications, the Convenience Key allows for access to one app or shortcut from anywhere in the phone, including from standby. Josh had a little trouble trying to figure out what to program to it, since the camera shortcut of pressing power twice is already available. In my case, I found Google Voice Search to be the best way to use the button, which is sitting just below the volume rocker.. And finally, there is the fingerprint reader embedded in aÂ. place that makes an incredible amount of sense for a BlackBerry — the spacebar. A couple of LEDs even pulse to show when it can be used, and unlocking the device is as easy as resting oneâs thumb on the sensor, since pressing down the spacebar while in standby doesnât do anything.. So, despite a slight learning curve and muscle memory reprogramming, the KEYone eventually becomes a very comfortable device to handle on the daily. BlackBerry basically updated their Classic and Bold devices for the current Android era, and to great effect — the KEYone is the only device of its kind in the flagship space, managing to find the best middle ground for every feature splayed on its body. We applaud BlackBerry for putting some real thought into the KEYone without going too far with certain aspects like the phoneâs thickness or the screenâs smaller size to make room for the keyboard.. Smartphone displays have been changing in recent months, and not just in terms of resolution. While most of us are probably used to the standard 16:9 aspect ratios found in most smartphones, the LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8/Plus sport taller and thinner 18:9 and 18.5:9 aspect ratios, respectively.. The KEYone goes in the other direction, largely due to the physical keyboard taking up space on the front of the phone. It comes with a 4.5-inch IPS LCD display with a 3:2 aspect ratio. That might seem pretty small by today’s standards, but the extra width makes it feel much less cramped than it would if it had a 16:9 display.. And because of that 3:2 aspect ratio, that also means watching 16:9 YouTube videos will cause letterboxing. That’s not a make or break observation by any means, but is still worth pointing out.. a 1620 x 1080 resolution, with a pixel density of 433 ppi. No, it’s not as pixel-dense as a Quad HD screen, but it’s certainly sharp enough for enjoying YouTube videos and playing games.. Of course, given that this is an LCD display, it’s not going to be as saturated as most AMOLED panels out there, though it’s not particularly lacking in any sense, either. It’s sharp and vibrant, and should be goodÂ. Screen mode option in the settings menu if you need to make the display cooler or warmer. That’s usually an overlooked feature, but really convenient if you’re particular about your smartphone’s display.. The KEYone's Ambient Display and double tap to wake features really come in handy. The KEYone also comes with an Ambient Display feature, similar to the one found on Nexus and Pixel devices. It only shows the time, date, and your notifications when they show up, and is otherwise off at all times. You can’t raise the phone to bring back the Ambient Display, nor can you press a button on the keyboard to wake it. We don’t want to call this an underbaked feature, solely because it’s simple. Rather, it’s just a set-it-and-forget-it feature that you turn on once in the settings menu.. BlackBerry did, however, include a double tap to wake feature for the KEYone’s display, which is really handy if you need to wake the device’s display when it’s sitting on a desk or table.. Itâs important to remember what kind of user most benefits from this new BlackBerry. The spec sheet makes this phone seem far from the flagships it might be compared to — the Snapdragon 625, Adreno 506, and 3 GB of RAM are all at least one step back from basically any high profile and high-end phone weâve seen recently. It should come as no surprise, then, that this phone wonât be the biggest powerhouse. That doesnât mean that the KEYone is incapable of getting things done — itâs important to remember what kind of user most benefits from this new BlackBerry.. Loading graphics-intensive apps was the main issue, with higher-end games and emulators hanging for a bit before actually launching after a tap. Once in the game, however, the experience was smooth without much slowdown. However, on plenty of occasions both Josh and myself experienced slowdowns when opening up other applications when these games continued running or were pushed to the background (read: in the RAM).. So, the hardcore media consumer or gamer wonât have the best time with the KEYone. And while the combination of lower-end specifications are to blame for this, we feel that the 3 GB of RAM is the most noticeable issue. The settings screen will pretty much always say that the 2.8 GB of usable RAM is maybe 2.3 or 2.5 GB full, so it was easy to point at that as an issue.. As such, Josh found himself doing what he called âClear All Maintenance,â a practice in which he went to the recent apps screen and hit Clear All both randomly and before loading certain apps like emulators. This turned into a subconscious habit — one that Josh felt improved the general daily usage — but one situation constantly frustrated him: Android Auto. About half of the time, the plugged in KEYone would hang for a noticeable amount of time before loading the Android Auto interface in his Volkswagen GTI infotainment system. It never crashed once loaded, but the pause was hard to brush off.. Just donât expect this phone to be able to do everything all at once, all the time. While itâs easy to view the performance as the worst part, we have to remind users that the KEYone is geared toward productivity and enterprise. And in that specific scope, the phone performs swimmingly. Workflows will differ between users, but we didnât feel slowed down in any productivity-centric situation. We were messaging colleagues on Slack while jumping between the Hub for e-mails, sliding over the Productivity Tab to view upcoming tasks or calendar entries, and popping back to the home screen to quickly load any application via keyboard shortcuts — lather, rinse, repeat. Even dual window multitasking is possible, as Josh played YouTube while responding to emails on multiple occasions. Just donât expect this phone to be able to do everything all at once, all the time.. 32 GB is the only built-in storage option available here, butÂ. if that isnât enough for you, expandable storage via microSD is possible for up to an additional 2 TB.Â. There’s no second SIM card slot, though.. Additional connectivity features include Bluetooth 4.2 (LE), NFC, and even an FM radio.. On the bottom of the device there are two speaker grills, though only the right one is a speaker. Speaker quality is pretty poor for the most part; it doesn’t get very loud when listening to music or podcasts, though it should be good enough to use during speakerphone calls in most cases.. Normally when we talk about single bottom-firing speakers, we also gripe about how easy they are to cover up when playing games. That’s actually not the case here, as sound tends to bleed through the physical keyboard on the front of the device. So even if you do cover up the speaker grill by accident, it’s not the end of the world.. One area in which the KEYone excels is in battery life, and that’s thanks to theÂ. We’ve both been able to achieve about 4.5 hours of screen-on time on a regular basis, with average use. But that’s just for everyday use. In some cases, both Josh and I have achieved 6+ hours of screen-on time, and that includes browsing through social media and watching the occasional YouTube video.. The KEYone's battery just won't quit. When you do run low on battery, BlackBerry says you’ll be able to achieve a 50 percent charge in just 36 minutes, and we can absolutely vouch for that claim. When you plug the device in, you’re presented with two different charging options: Charge Only mode, or Boost mode. Charge Only mode is just your standard way of charging the phone with Quick Charge 3.0. Boost mode, however, puts the phone into a sort of power saving mode and shuts down background processes to maximize the charging efficiency of the device. This isn’t really something you’re going to need to use every time you plug in, but it should come in handy if you only have a few minutes to charge up.. And in case you were wondering, the KEYone doesn’t support any form of wireless charging. Some might view a physical keyboard as a frivolous addition to a touchscreen world, but the key feature (the last one, I swear) of this BlackBerry easily gave us some of our favorite experiences in Android this year.. BlackBerry veterans (especially users of the old Bold phones and the more recent BlackBerry Classic) will feel at home with this form factor that is the only one of its kind in todayâs Android landscape. Others, however, may need a little bit of time to get used to the KEYoneâs learning curve.. The physical keyboard takes a while to get used to. Pressing down with force on the different keys for Â. typing took a bit of getting used to for our team members who are used to swipes and light touch typing on virtual keyboards. Josh, a resident Fleksy and NINtype typist, felt this as the slower typing speed on the KEYone somewhat deflated his enthusiasm. But after some time, muscle memory and repetition led to more comfort and speed, even if one handed typing was done less. It seems that the general workflow for the KEYone hinges on typing with two hands and then resorting to voice input when necessary. Even the currency key that has a speaker icon on it only has one function aside from designating monetary denominations — it simply toggles the loudspeaker during calls.. âOh, let me look that up real quick.â. âYelp says that this restaurant has 4 stars. Great, so Iâll see you there!â. This example also shows how the physical keyboard keeps the screen from getting cluttered. Without a virtual keyboard to take up close to half of the available screen real estate, the important bits are unhindered. Think YouTube and then Facebook Messenger in multiwindow mode, where your keyboard typing is simply out of the way.. I bet that many users are looking forward to setting up their keyboard shortcuts — be forewarned, however, that the shortcuts require the BlackBerry Launcher to be in use. The home screens monitor for short or long presses in order to trigger any of the programmed apps or shortcuts, which means tapping home and then the desired shortcut key whenever necessary. Any third party launcher will break this functionality. While that is a bummer, we explain later on how we love the BlackBerry software and find that we didnât really feel the need to change launchers. In other launchers, however, any presses on the keyboard will instantly trigger Device Search, which easily brings up shortcuts to the same apps and shortcuts.. We felt it would be nice for us to share our top 5 most used keyboard shortcuts, so many you can get an idea of what you would choose:Â. The number of shortcuts you can program into the physical keyboard can get overwhelming. With some imagination, there are many possibilities provided by the KEYoneâs physical keyboard. As you may have surmised from earlier statements about the BlackBerry Launcher and shortcuts, the only thing limiting this keyboard is the companyâs own oversight. It would be nice for a swipe down on the keyboard to reveal the notification dropdown, for example. And if long presses on the keys could still do shortcuts no matter what launcher is in use, that would please many users who prefer their third party launchers. But there is definitely a ton to fun to be had with a physical keyboard, so many Josh wasnât so crazy to be such an advocate for it in past Android Authority Podcast episodes.. By far, the most enjoyable part about the keyboard is every moment that either Josh or I found out a new function. Josh found a rather deep setting that could convert one of the shift buttons into a sort of âCtrlâ key, allowing for copy and paste shortcuts like âControl+Aâ for selecting all characters and âControl+Vâ for pasting from the clipboard. For those who use password managers, this is an incredibly useful tool.. Another use for the physical keyboard that Josh has used extensively deals with gaming – with a bevy of buttons at his disposal, Josh went a little old-school and started playing some of his favorite old games via emulators, programming the keys for controller input. The KEYone, then, was like a makeshift Game Boy Advance or a PSP with many of the on-screen controls shifted over to the keyboard.. I, on the other hand, have had daily discoveries. My latest pleasant surprise was in the camera, where the spacebar can be used as the shutter button and swiping up and down it easily changes the exposure compensation. That keeps fingers off the screen and the whole screen/viewfinder in plain sight.. BlackBerry takes cues from some reputable smartphone cameras to make one that is on par with typical needs. While the KEYone is not a particularly amazing shooter, it keeps from being below average. 12MP at 1.55Âµ sizes help this f/2.0 aperture lens capture pictures that are still pleasing enough to the eye despite lacking mainly in sharpness. Details in pretty much any photo are soft and are not as crisp as other shooters in this yearâs competition.. Video modes include 1080p at 60 fps or 4K video recording. A Pro mode is available but it does not provide as much freedom as the Galaxy S8 or the LG G6. And as we mentioned before, the keyboard provides a few different convenient gestures.. Where we do enjoy the camera experience is in self portraits. The front facing camera gets a nice bump up to 8MP, which is actually above the norm in the flagship space. As a result, selfies in good lighting come out looking pretty nice, with an expected sharpness bump compared to the common 5MP shooters.. We reiterate the focus of this phone — getting things done — and the camera is another example of that mentality. Even BlackBerry know this — while the company touts the rear camera for its capabilities (on paper), it clearly makes the point of mentioning video conference calls using the front facing 8MP camera.. In good lighting conditions, it isnât hard to get a good photo for sharing on social media or otherwise — in low light, however, the camera suffers from a lack of optical image stabilization, meaning slower shutter speeds will cause motion blur and hurt the overall picture. We donât think that the camera is terrible in any particular regard, it just doesnât offer as much as pretty much any other high-end device that weâve seen in 2017.. One of the biggest reasons to buy a BlackBerry phone is for the software. Not only is the software on the KEYone refined and a joy to use, the extra security benefits will help keep your information safe and secure. Before we get into that, though, let’s talk about the basics.. The KEYone is running Android 7.1.1 Nougat , which comes with a fair amount of BlackBerry’s own customizations on top. You wouldn’t necessarily know it though, as BlackBerry doesn’t really stray too far from what we know as “vanilla” Android.. The stock BlackBerry launcher comes with a ton of useful features that we have grown very fond of. feature present are pop-up widgets, which are denoted on each application icon with three small white dots. Swiping up or down on an app icon will bring up your widget of choice, which is a super easy way to access information without opening the app. We’d like to give credit to BlackBerry for implementing this featureÂ. in their launcher, but it’s a shameless ripoff of Action Launcher 3’s Shutters. At any rate, they work super well, and we’reÂ. Opening up the app drawer reveals a list of all your applications in alphabetical order, with two rows of recently-used apps on the top. Above that, you’ll find three tabs, which allow you to swipe between your apps, widgets, and shortcuts. We know some users are big fans of this app drawer layout, but on the KEYone, things are cluttered enough as is due to theÂ. We wish BlackBerry would do away with this tabbed layout and instead embrace Google’s method of accessing apps and shortcuts – by long-pressing on the home screen.. awkwardly designed app drawer, most of the other menus on the KEYone are pretty stock. The notification shade, quick settings menu, and even the settings menu (for the most part) are just like you’d find on a Nexus device. Even the recent apps menu can be changed from the default Masonry view to the standard Rolodex view you usually see in Android phones.. DTEK is a must-have for people who want to keep better tabs on their security. As we mentioned, there are a handful of other additions to the software that really make the KEYone stand out. For starters, we have DTEK, which is a preloaded security app that keeps an eye on your OS and apps to make sure nothing is fishy. Once you open the app, you’ll see a rating at the top that tells you how secure your device is. Below that, you’ll find all of the things DTEK keeps an eye on, including app permissions, factory reset protection, operating system integrity, data encryption, and much more. This is certainly a useful tool for people who want to keep better tabs on their security.. There’s also the classic BlackBerry Hub, which is a catch-all app for all the communication apps installed on your phone (well, most of them). Whether you’re using Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Slack, or pretty much any other messaging app you can think of, the BlackBerry Hub lets you see all of your messages in chronological order. If that’s too overwhelming for you, you can also switch between your list of accounts and filter between them.. What makes it most convenient, at least when setting up the phone for the first time, is the fact thatÂ. all of your services will be added to the Hub and logged in automatically.. One other popular feature that’s been available on BlackBerry devices for some time is the productivity tab, which you can access by swiping in from the left or right sides of the screen. It works in a similar fashion to the Edge features on Galaxy devices. The productivity tab gives you quick access to your current calendar events, emails, tasks, and your favorite contacts.. Perhaps one of the only software features that are missing from the KEYone is a blue light filter, which has become an increasingly popular feature in Android phones lately.. Overall, we’re really happy with the KEYone’s software. It’s not perfect, but it certainly helps you get things done quickly. And it looks good while doing it, too.. The BlackBerry KEYone is coming to the US Â. on May 31 for the price of $549.Â. Itâll also make its way to additional carriers, including Sprint , later in the summer, though exact availability details have yet to be revealed. Canada availability is also slated for May 31, while the phone is already on sale in the UK (at just one store, though).. This is a smartphone that gets stuff done. It may not be a phone for heavy gamers or media users, but it’s perfect for those constantly in communication with friends and coworkers, or for productivity-focused users who rely on their phones to keep their lives balanced. The addition of a physical keyboard only makes this point even more true, as the endless amount of keyboard shortcuts and ease of use makesÂ. multitasking and sending quick messages that much easier.. This is a smartphone for people who like different. BlackBerry really thought out of the box with the KEYone, and in doing so, produced a well-built, productivity-focused smartphone that not only looks different, but isn’tÂ. anything like the other phones on the market.. That’s not to say this is a perfect smartphone; performance is lacking in some areas, and the camera could be much better.Â. Still, it’s a completely different experience from what we normally get with Android smartphones, and BlackBerry definitely deserves credit for that.. What are your thoughts on the BlackBerry KEYone?

After the initial announcement of the BlackBerry KEYone at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) earlier this year, BlackBerry fans who have been hanging on to their Passports, Classics (or Privs) once again got excited for two reasons. First, they were happy to know that BlackBerry had not put its smartphone plans to rest and secondly, that there is now another BlackBerry device to look up to, one that should successfully merge Android with the true BlackBerry experience that was once BlackBerry OS.. Last year, I reviewed the BlackBerry Priv. The year prior to that, BlackBerry was still clinging on to BlackBerry OS 10 with the “abnormal” Passport and the “retro” Classic. At the end of my review I came to the conclusion that the Priv was a bit of a confused device. It was neither a BlackBerry in terms of user experience, nor was it a stellar Android flagship because it simply could not do anything better than existing competitors. And then, there was the sky high Rs 62,990 price tag (it's now retailing at Rs 30,000 online).. With the launch of the BlackBerry KEYone Limited Edition Black in India, I was just looking out for two key improvements: The capacitive keyboard and BlackBerry’s integration with Android. Because, frankly speaking, there’s not much that would help BlackBerry differentiate its product from a Samsung, HTC or even a OnePlus smartphone out there; especially when you keep in mind its Rs 39,990 price tag.. Strangely, there were a lot more improvements, but it all boils down to. one essential BlackBerry element, its keyboard.. I fell in love with the design of the BlackBerry KEYone when it was first announced at the MWC earlier this year. The Limited Edition Black launched in India is no different and the unit I received for review comes from TCL as well. So apart from the Black finish, the 4 GB RAM and 64 GB of storage options, there’s really not much of visual difference between the two models.. I came across a couple of smartphone users who said that it looked old and dated. When I asked them why, they simply pointed to the keyboard on the front. “Who uses a keyboard on a smartphone these days?” went the common refrain.. Others, especially BlackBerry fans, drooled over its design and appreciated the finish and quality. Add to this the heft at 180 grams that adds to the premium feel.. The KEYone looks different compared to any smartphone out there.. I felt that the KEYone was a fresh and modern take on. There’s the front face with a 3:2 display and the capacitive navigation keys just below it followed by the physical QWERTY keypad (that is also touch sensitive).. As mentioned in my first impressions, BlackBerry has gone in for a ‘blacked-out’ look. Almost every surface of the body comes with a matte-black finish, save for the polished keys, the camera ring and the BlackBerry logo on the back. The smartphone uses four materials for its construction, glass, plastic, metal and rubber (or silicon) which is one too many for a smartphone these days. But it is how BlackBerry puts it all together that is quite impressive.. The rubberised back on the rear gives it a modern look, apart from providing plenty of grip. On the front, there’s the camera lens at the top with a. Down below is the Gorilla Glass covered display. On the back is camera lens and then a centrally-aligned. BlackBerry logo a little below that.. The glass camera lens, and BlackBerry logo.. Next up is the rubberised back that does a good job at keeping your KEYone in your hand. This is a necessity as the location of keyboard is at the bottom of the phone. Had there been a metal back like on normal smartphones, the KEYone would keep slipping off and flipping out of your hand while typing on the keyboard.. As for every other bit that I have not mentioned above, it uses metal.. All-in-all, the design of the BlackBerry KEYone sure left me impressed, it had a mix of sharp and rounded corners at the right places and the multi-textured surfaces brings back memories of the good old days of creative smartphone design, which is basically the era before Apple showed up .. The Keyboard of the KEYone is good, but BlackBerry or TCL (or Optiemus) could have done better. The keys feature better travel compared to the previous Priv, so they don’t bottom out that easy. In short, they still do not match the physical keyboard of the BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900.. The keyboard is the best you can currently get on an Android smartphone. Typing was a bit of a problem, because the keyboard has a short height, as I often ended up pressing two keys initially, but after a few days I began to find them accurately thanks to muscle memory. The keyboard could have been taller, but BlackBerry wanted a taller display, so they seemed to have compromised on the keyboard to allow for a device that actually works fine with one-handed use.. BlackBerry has also made the keyboard capacitive. Just like the Priv, you can swipe in two directions to switch tabs in an app (if it’s enabled) or scroll through lists (chats, emails, images and more). It sounds like a great idea, but in reality, it’s not well thought out (more about this in Performance).. The keyboard by far is the best one you can get on an Android smartphones these days (there’s really no competition). So if it’s a keyboard you are after, then you have no choice but to look at the KEYone.. The BlackBerry KEYone features a 4.5-inch IPS LCD display with an odd, 3:2 screen ratio covered by Corning’s Gorilla Glass 4. Below it sits the capacitive keys for navigation. Inside, you get an unusual candidate for a flagship smartphone, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 that is clocked at the usual 2 GHz. Flagships are expected to carry an 800-series Snapdragon chip, or its equivalent. There’s 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage that can be expanded using the hybrid SIM tray by inserting microSD cards of up to 2 TB in capacity.. As for the other highlight of KEYone, it is the rear-facing camera. The unit is the Sony IMX378, which is the same camera module that also came in the Google Pixel ( which was pretty good ). The camera includes a 12 MP sensor with Phase Detection Autofocus (PDAF) and a lens with an f/2.0 aperture. It lacks OIS so the camera heavily relies on EIS for both video and still images. The front-facing camera is an 8 MP unit with an f/2.2 aperture but comes with a fixed focus lens setup.. Quite the unique combination of features and hardware. Coming to connectivity you get support for Dual 4G SIMs with VoLTE using a hybrid SIM tray that lets you swap one SIM out for a microSD card. There’s Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n (2.4 GHz), 802.11 a/n and ac for 5 GHz, 4G mobile hotspot, Bluetooth v4.2, NFC, an FM Radio and a USB Type-C connector with OTG support.. Powering it all is a 3,505 mAh battery.. But since this is a BlackBerry, there’s more. The fingerprint reader does not sit on the back, but on the front, and it has been smartly embedded into the spacebar key, which literally makes it invisible.. The fingerprint reader embedded into the space key is a cool move. While unlocking the phone, two tiny lights blink to give you a hint that you need to place your finger on that key. It is a miniscule feature, but rarely do we come across it on smartphones.. Another feature related to the physical keyboard are the shortcuts, where every key can be customised to launch a particular app or feature.. You can assign function to all 52 of them to call on any app (native or third-party). There’s also the 'Convenience' key that can be assigned to open any app, which. is available below the volume rocker on the right side.. The display on the BlackBerry KEYone is a rather odd one. It is a 3:2 ratio IPS LCD display with a 1,620x1,080 pixel array. It still manages to look taller, sitting above what appears to be a shorter keyboard.. The 4.5-inch IPS LCD display is super sharp at 413 PPI. As for the display itself, it is sharp at 434 PPI and it was hard for me to spot a stray pixel anywhere no matter how closely I looked at text or the icons. LCD screen was bright both in outdoors and in direct sunlight conditions. However, the adaptive brightness feature was a bit problematic. It would often dim the display a bit too much. Thankfully, it is something that can be adjusted in Settings, so it wasn’t much of a hindrance.. Colours looked a bit saturated and the display tended to showcase cooler tones overall. But the hue could be changed in the Settings app under Display Settings.. The BlackBerry Priv comes with Android 7.1 and there are plenty of customisations. There are customisations to the user interface and the way the software is handled to deliver the rather aggressive battery life times I have experience during my week-long review period.. Starting with the user interface, it almost looks like stock Android with stock-looking icons, the usual app drawer and a Spartan notifications tray and settings menu.. The BlackBerry KEYone software interface looks almost stock. The software ran fine, but wasn’t buttery smooth. Indeed, you cannot expect things to be this way because of BlackBerry’s customisations (there’s the Hub and the Productivity Tab) and the fact that there is a power efficient Snapdragon 625 chipset inside. The KEYone comes with a Power Center application, found in the app drawer. This is different from the standard Battery settings in the Settings app and will let you customise and control how each app consumes the available power from the battery.. We have seen resolution changes before on the Samsung Galaxy S8 and then on the Huawei Honor 8 Pro as well. They let you run the smartphone at a lower resolution to lower the graphics load that will suck up less power.. The Power Center Application is any Android fan's wet dream. On the KEYone, BlackBerry takes things a step (or may be two) further. You get per app power customisations here. These are usually available upon rooting and tweaking your smartphone to quite an extent, but BlackBerry has conveniently delivered the same in an app.. You can tweak the brightness level when a particular app is launched along with resolution, and even the frame rate! So if you happen to be an extreme WhatsApp user, you can save battery life when using the app by reducing the brightness, reducing the resolution and even dropping the app’s frame rate down to 30 fps (instead of 60). You can do this for not only one, but for every single app you installed or that comes preinstalled, including the BlackBerry launcher (or home) app. I did notice that some games like Real Racing will crash upon changing the default power usage from Balanced to Performance.. The BlackBerry Hub makes little sense after Android 7.1. At the same time, BlackBerry Hub is the same old stuff I used on the Priv, and its sole reason to exist only comes from the fact that it displays a history of your notifications. Its problem lies in the fact that is not well integrated into third-party apps. So if you get a WhatsApp notification all you can do is swipe to delete it from your Hub view or schedule it to appear again in while. You just cannot reply inline, like on. Clearly, the standard Android notifications shade is more practical and time saving as tapping on a WhatsApp message in the Hub will simply open up the app.. The Productivity Tab is buggy and refused to open up at times. As for the Productivity Tab, it is an always available floating tab that will show you recent emails, contacts and calendar updates. Somehow I wished that BlackBerry would do away with the Hub and include everything, including notifications, in the productivity tab, but then again, you have a notifications tray on any Android smartphone for that and it's accessible with a simple swipe from the top.. Indeed this is one area where the BlackBerry KEYone does fall short. The benchmarks scores are strictly on par with budget smartphones. When I say budget, I mean smartphones like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 that come with a similar chipset, RAM and storage bits, but are priced around Rs 12,000 (instead of Rs 40,000).. But as I said in my first impressions , it is not what you have but what you do with it that really matters.. From the software section, it is easy to see that BlackBerry has done plenty of work under the hood.. Then there’s BlackBerry’s promise of delivering one of the most secure Android smartphones out there. It uses a hardware root of trust, which adds security keys to the processor. In short, it makes the data in your smartphone really hard to get to (read impossible) for a thief, if your smartphone is stolen.. BlackBerry KeyOne Performance Benchmarks Infogram. This however does not really slow down the smartphone by any margin. Being a business or productivity focussed smartphone the BlackBerry KEYone can play every single game available on the Google Play Store. There are no slowdowns and no heating issues whatsoever. The games that I tested ( Real Racing 3, Asphalt 8: Xtreme, Dead Trigger 2, Aqueducts, Subway Surfers ) did run with lowered texture settings.. Gaming graphics are not exactly flagship quality. There is the cropped 3:2 view (instead of the usual 16:9), that kind of gives you that claustrophobic feeling while playing games. Add to this the left aligned display thanks to the physical keyboard and it’s not exactly the best smartphone to play games with. So if you are into serious 3D gaming, the KEYone is not the device for you.. Audio quality through the receiver was good but nothing great. Having used the Passport and then the Classic followed by the Priv, the call quality was pretty decent in my opinion. Listening to music using my headphones was a good experience where the KEYone delivered balanced highs and lows without going heavy on the bass notes. The speaker was loud, but it sounded tinny so it is not something you can use during a call unless you are in a quiet place, let alone listen to music. So you have a physical keyboard with a track pad-like keyboard surface that recognises two gesture swipes (top. to bottom and left to right and vice versa), which also means you don’t have to touch the display. That also means you have more viewable screen real-estate without your meddling digits getting in the way. Well, that may have been BlackBerry’s idea behind it, but in reality it is far from the truth.. Only the first three rows are touch sensitive. The touch sensitive keys are limited to the first three rows. The bottom row with the prominent space bar (embedded with a fingerprint reader) and the symbol and shift keys are inactive. In short, unlike the Priv, that had a taller track pad like space (a replacement for the optical trackpad), the area on the KEYone for swiping is reduced to barely an inch. This now means that you have to swipe and swipe and swipe, with limited inertial scrolling. Add to this the jittery detection of your finger (unlike the Priv) and I was better of scrolling using the display. Scrolling by touching the display worked a lot smoother as compared to the capacative keypad.. The touch sensitive area is just too tiny. On older BlackBerry devices when you scrolled though messages, or a menu, you would obviously want to click on a selection at the end of it (it is what normal human beings do). The tiny trackball (or even the side scroll wheel) allowed for this (and was mighty accurate in my opinion) as well. The touch gestures on the KEYone’s keypad only allow for scrolling. So you scroll through a long list and then you have to reach out to the display, (that starts far up) to tap on your selection. You cannot even move a cursor while typing an email on the BlackBerry Hub. To move the cursor, select text, copy text, you have to move to your fingers to the display, which is mounted higher than usual on a smartphone.. In short, navigation is a complete mess and you are better off using the display for interacting with the software. Had BlackBerry provided the ability to select software buttons as you swipe, the implementation of the same would have been a welcome move. But as of now, the touch-happy keyboard on the KEYone is only good for typing.. Camera: 7.5/10 I really had high expectations for the camera on the BlackBerry KEYone ever since it was launched. As mentioned in the Features section, it packs in the same camera module, which is also found on the Google Pixel. But again, as mentioned earlier, that does not really warrant great camera performance.. The BlackBerry KEYone's camera stands on it own and offers impressive video recording. The Google Pixel uses plenty of software trickery (HDR+ included) to deliver photos like no other. Oddly, that also works well because the Pixel features a Snapdragon 821 and a laser assisted focusing system. Clearly, that humbler 625 chipset in the KEYone is nowhere close to the Pixel. But by no means is its camera performance bad. The camera delivered well-exposed photos with well-balanced colours.. This was visible in some dim and extreme low light photos that somehow managed to capture some detail despite that f/2.0 aperture lens.. The HDR Auto mode was pretty good it’s just that there was plenty of ghosting visible in the images, especially with moving objects.. Focusing was instantaneous in daylight and fast in low light as well. My only gripe here is the automatic night mode, which seems to kill some of the details in some low light images.. The lack of optical image stabilisation is indeed a big miss here and the camera could have benefited plenty from it. Low light images could have been crisper as well.. Most of the images shot however lack depth. The photograph of my nephew is a good example of the same problem. It literally looks flat despite the subject being well isolated from the background. The same goes for the landscape images, it’s really hard to tell what object is ahead or behind simply because the focus is a bit too soft.. The interface on the BlackBerry KEYone camera. Video recording too was pretty impressive with options for 4K 30 fps, 1080p 60 fps and 1080p 30 fps with enhanced stabilisation.. Overall, the camera on the BlackBerry KEYone may not beat the Priv, but it stands up well on its own and comes quite close to the Huawei Honor 8 and the OnePlus 5, if not beating them in some areas.. If battery life is your concern, then you really need to look no further, the KEYone is the smartphone for you. The device may not be built for media consumption (like the massive Xiaomi Mi Max 2), but it beats the pants off any flagship smartphone out there by a mile.. The BlackBerry KEYone did well on our standard PC Mark test. While our standard PC Mark 2.0 Battery Life test gave a good 10 hours 42 minutes, with my daily usage, I literally lost track of when I had last charged the smartphone. My daily usage consists of shooting a few photos, downloading apps via Wi-Fi, video steaming for about 2-3 hours on Wi-Fi, three email accounts on push sync with WhatsApp, Slack and Telegram buzzing all day long. Oh and lets not forget about an hour of 3D gaming.. Daily usage times beats the pants off any other smartphone. The device needed to be charged once in two days! I often ended up with figures like 1 day 22 hours since last charge, which sounds unrealistic and abnormal after I just reviewed the OnePlus 5. With the OnePlus 5 and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 inside I would end up with figures like 19 hours since last charged before plugging the device in.. So yes, the KEYone with its combination of a smaller 4.5-inch display, a Snapdragon 625 and a 3,505 mAh battery has delivered the goods when it comes to flagships, with almost two days of battery life.. Back in the day, we had BlackBerry devices for email, and regular Nokia phones for (what was called) multimedia and even the N-gage for gaming.. Then Steve Jobs showed up with the Apple iPhone took down all those categories (altogether in one go). Today, we have Android smartphones that can literally do everything a BlackBerry can.. A fresh new take on a nostalgic piece of tech, but not much has changed really. In this cutthroat crowded market, the BlackBerry KEYone diverts ever so little from the norm. There’s a keyboard for beginners and then there’s the capable camera and finally the battery life, one that has no competition.. But are you ready to deal with a physical keyboard?. At Rs 39,990, customers will find it hard to ignore the LG G6 (at Rs 36,790) and the OnePlus 5 (at Rs. Out of the three competitors, the G6 even offers a taller 18:9 display with IP 68 water and dust resistance. More importantly, it can do everything the BlackBerry can do, save for security, the camera and that impressive battery life.. BlackBerry fans and some brave Android souls who are tired of the boring candy bar designs and virtual keyboards will get something different with the BlackBerry KEYone. The design is a breath of fresh air in the Android world, and so are those battery life times. Both of these should be enough to make the KEYone a worthy buy even at Rs 39,990… for some.. As for the rest, they will simply shy away and either go in for an LG G6 or a OnePlus 5 because nobody today wants to deal with the same old physical keyboard. The one that BlackBerry has been harping about for the past 14 years but has not innovated on since the Quark. It’s about time BlackBerry reinvented the smartphone keyboard!. #Blackberry Keyone Limited Edition Black Performance.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. The BlackBerry KeyOne is the latest handset to carry the BlackBerry name. Thanks to the inclusion of a physical keyboard and two-tone styling it will appeal to the faithfully BlackBerry crowd, but can it reach beyond this hopefully profitable niche audience?. Manufactured and sold under licence by TCL, the KeyOne specifications place the handset in the mid-range bracket. It has 32GB of storage and 3GB of memory coupled with the SnapDragon 625 system on chip. The KeyOne might not play the current crop of graphically intensive games, but it has the chops to run your email and messaging apps, document editing suites and bespoke enterprise apps.. The key benefit in having slightly lower specs is revealed when you note the 3505 mAh battery and the inclusion of USB-C quick charging. The KeyOne is designed for long battery life and productivity throughout the day. The KeyOne comfortably makes it through a working day, and will reach well into a second day. With a little bit of restraint, you have a phone that can stay usefully running for two days between charges.. I’m not so sold on the screen. The inclusion of the physical keyboard cuts back the real estate available for the screen. At 1080x1620 pixels it’s a step back in time to a 3:2 ratio screen and that’s not something modern Android apps are designed for. Most apps are designed to take account for different screen sizes so they do all rescale and work, but that doesn’t mean they are optimised for a 3:2 ratio screen.. If the keyboard had been virtual I suspect we’d be looking at a 1080p HD screen. But I’ll come back to the keyboard in a moment.. There are three major strands at play in the BlackBerry KeyOne that will impact on a purchasing decision. the Android platform, BlackBerry’s custom software, and the keyboard.. Picking Android as your smartphone base is pretty much the only game in town. Apple has iOS, but good luck trying to get that to run on your third-party smartphone. Microsoft’s Windows 10 for Mobile covers the basics but in a connected app-driven world the market for Redmond’s world on your smartphone is minimal (besides, many of the Microsoft apps you need are already available for Android). And yes there are smaller alternatives (Tizen, Sailfish, even custom coded Linux bases), but be honest. If you’re making a smartphone, you’re going to be using Android. Thankfully the KeyOne comes with the latest version of Android (7.1) and the last few handsets have received regular security and software updates.. It’s what you put on top of Android that makes you stand out.. While other manufacturers have decided to be as ‘pure’ as possible (notably HMD Global and the return of the Nokia brand to the smartphone space), BlackBerry’s Android handsets have a number of additions that both add to functionality of Android but also harken back to its handsets of old. You have the Hub application which brings all of your emails, instant messenger accounts and social media alerts into a single ’super notification’ area that not only allows you to view the incoming messages but also act on the, action responses and reply, all from within the app. It’s not perfect - shoehorning in a variety of different styles of message under one UI does lead to some compromises.. BlackBerry’s suite of apps also leans heavily on security, both of the device itself and your personal data. You can triage just how secure your handset is with the DTEK software, and if the handset is not in the best of health you’ll get recommendations on how to secure the handset.. BlackBerry has also provided its own calendar and contacts application. Coupled with its email and messaging clients (and the venerable BBM) anyone looking for the days of pastel colors and lots of text to read in the same font and size will feel right at home. If you believe that an enterprise-focused device needs to be utilitarian and not fun, then the KeyOne is setting the right tone for you. I’m sold on the functionality, but I’m not completely sold on this argument of ‘enterprise is boring’.. I think a lot of this does come down to the aesthetics of the handset. The KeyOne is trying to capture the feel of BlackBerry at the start of the 21st century, when this approach ruled the business world. It has achieved that in software, and thanks to the most visible sign possible, it has managed that in hardware as well.. The keyboard is both essential and superfluous to the package.. In use I found it awkward. Not because of the small size of keys - thanks to the tilted profile of each key it’s easy enough to make sure you hit the right key - but returning to a physical keyboard on a smartphone means a return to requiring accuracy. It means hunting for the right punctuation symbol and which modifier you need to press (shift, uppercase, alt, or symbol). It means saying goodbye to the predictive text inputs, the AI offering you wide margins of error, and the ability to input at speed and let modern computing power sort out the errors. The keyboard may be the biggest marketing move that Blackberry can make, but it feels like the biggest hindrance as well.. With a small market share in the handset space, the BlackBerry brand is right to create handsets that appeal to niche audiences, especially if those audiences are heavily invested in the brand and are looking for a mix of modernity and nostalgia. The KeyOne delivers in this regard. Here’s a modern smartphone that’s coupled with the ‘legendary’ BlackBerry keyboard.. But times have moved on, processing power has improved and on-screen keyboards are far more accurate than ten years ago when the love for a physical keyboard was at its peak. For me the keyboard is a cute addition to the package but it is no longer needed.. Strip away the keyboard from the KeyOne package and you have a solid mid-range Android handset with enough power to work though most online tasks, a handset which is able to handle business work and offers some nice security touches. In actual fact you have something akin to last year’s BlackBerry DTEK 60 handset… and that leads me to the question that lingers over the KeyOne. Do you really need a physical keyboard on a modern smartphone? The simple answer here is no. Technology has solved the input problem.. The BlackBerry faithful will flock to the KeyOne in a haze of nostalgia and I’m not going to stand in their way - this is clearly the handset they want and love. For everyone else, if you are looking for a BlackBerry flavoured Android handset, the KeyOne is not the answer - you should be looking at the DTEK60.. Now read more about the BlackBerry DTEK60….

Come for the keyboard, stay for the battery life. You probably already know if this is your next phone.. Even after months — years — the sounds, the smells, the feelings , are unavoidable.. Even more so than the Priv , which was released 18 months ago, the KEYone is BlackBerry's attempt to appeal to its core audience, as small as it may be, with the best hardware keyboard on the market. With that it succeeds, but falls down in a couple notable areas along the way.. The KEYone is the best phone for those upgrading from BlackBerry 10, or are holding onto a Priv. For everyone else, it's probably not going to move the needle.. Android 7.1.1 on board at launch. Best hardware keyboard on the market. Best security update pedigree outside of Google. Performance is inconsistent (likely from buggy software). Camera has potential but suffers in low light. BlackBerry Mobile, which is actually TCL Communications, which makes Alcatel phones, has done an admirable job furthering the legacy of BlackBerry's transition from BB10 to Android. Not only does the KEYone sport the same security enhancements, including Hardware Root of Trust and Verified Boot as all BlackBerry phones released in the past couple of years, but it runs Android 7.1.1 out of the box, and promises to receive monthly security updates. To say that the KEYone is one of the most secure phones on the market right now would probably not be an overstatement.. But the KEYone is also inherently divisive, willfully limiting its potential customer base with a hardware keyboard that harkens back to a time, between six and 10 years ago, when not only were BlackBerrys essential tools for millions of people, but few could envision typing on anything but that miniaturized version of the desktop keyboard.. Times have changed, and people have adjusted. This phone is for the others , and for them it's almost perfect.. 4.5-inch, 1620x1080 IPS LCD 434ppi.

I (Daniel Bader) am writing this review after spending 10 days with a pre-production version of the BlackBerry KEYone. BB Mobile says that the hardware is near-final but the software is not, meaning that some of the software issues could be fixed in an update. If so, we'll update this review.. The phone was running Android 7.1.1 Nougat on Build AAK831 with the April 5, 2017 security patch. It received an update to Build AAL093, which fixed a number of early bugs and performance problems, on May 3, just a few hours before publishing this review. The phone stayed on the Bell network in Canada throughout its testing.. This is a solid device, as all high-end BlackBerry devices have been over the past few years. Most notably, the aluminum frame joins with the metal frets of the keyboard seamlessly, and while I'm not an enormous fan of the flat top with rounded corners, the phone certainly paints a unique picture.. That fingerprint sensor in the space bar: my goodness, is it awesome.. Indeed, the matte silver finish of the frame honors early BlackBerry models without going too retro, though the black-and-silver color palette definitely gives me the feels. There are modern touches here, though: the symmetrical speaker and microphone grills on the bottom are flanked by a USB-C port, while the sizeable (and distracting, to be honest) front-facing camera sits next to etched holes and a duo of sensors brace against a large 4.5-inch LCD screen.. Back in 2014, when the Passport was released, I remember wondering how BlackBerry would eventually release an Android phone given that its keyboard takes up so much vertical space. The screen is really good — surprisingly good — though not quite as bright as I'd like (though, really, coming from a Galaxy S8 , it's not really a fair comparison). More importantly, though, its 3:2 aspect ratio makes sense: most Android apps can adapt to the reduced vertical real estate, just as they can for the taller counterparts on the Galaxy S8 and LG G6.. What's irritating, and something I don't quite understand, is BlackBerry Mobile's use of capacitive navigation buttons below the screen; for a phone that insists its keyboard is smart, and encourages swiping vertically to scroll through web pages and feeds, it's far too easy to accidentally hit one of the three buttons.. My only other hardware gripe is the placement of the power button, which mirrors BB Mobile's Alcatel counterparts by placing it on the left side of the phone. I'm all for catering to lefties, but I don't think this is the solution. The right side houses a volume rocker and, below it, a programmable convenience key that can be assigned to anything except turning on and off the phone. I think the convenience key is a great idea, but justifying the power button's placement by saying that people will use the fingerprint sensor to turn on the phone and double-tap the display to turn it off again goes against the years of muscle memory most smartphone users have built up.. Speaking of that fingerprint sensor, it's seamlessly integrated into the keyboard's space bar, and my goodness is it awesome. The DTEK60 , a repackaged TCL 950, has its fingerprint sensor on the back, but this one is just perfect: fast, accurate, and well-placed.. Let's talk about the keyboard, because in all likelihood it's a big reason you're considering the phone at all. It's good, probably 90% as good as the one on the BlackBerry Classic, and certainly the best on any modern phone.. The keys are wide and responsive, with excellent travel that return to position instantly. If you're a current BlackBerry user, you're quickly going to feel at ease here, and if you're a lapsed CrackBerry addict, the adjustment period will likely be brief.. While the familiar BlackBerry frets are here, the keys are not quite as contoured and angled as they used to be, which BlackBerry Mobile says comes from a need to optimize for the gestures that were popularized by the Passport and, later, the Priv. It's a fine compromise, and not one I mind, but it doesn't do anything to assuage the cognitive dissonance I feel returning to typing on a physical keyboard.. You won't convince me that physical keys are the future, but this one is damn good.. Yes, like I mentioned before, typing on the KEYone is like coming home. But the home feels smaller, more cramped, and rife with compromise. I'll try my best not to brutalize the metaphor too much, but even after using the KEYone all day, every day, for nearly two weeks, I haven't fallen back in love with the process. Typing on this phone is a chore. It's the reason I kept the slider closed on the Priv for much of its life.. I strongly believe that virtual keyboards in their current form provide a superior and more accurate typing experience than a physical one — but that's just me. Google Keyboard; SwiftKey; even BlackBerry's own superb virtual keyboard: they're all very good at figuring out what you're trying to say, and correcting your mistakes as you type. And while BlackBerry's keyboard does that, too, the satisfying feedback of physical keys doesn't always lead to a better experience.. (Those dismissing my pedigree right now should take into account my history with BlackBerrys. My first smartphone was a BlackBerry Pearl 8100, which a few months later was replaced by a Bold 9000. I used that 9000 for years , eventually replacing it with a Bold 9700 and Bold 9900.. In between, I held onto almost every BlackBerry imaginable, from the chiclet keys of the Curve 8300 to, later, the Tour 9630 and Torch 9800. I loved those phones. When BlackBerry 10 was released, I upgraded not to the Z10 but the Q10. I used the Passport; I gave the Classic a try. Even when I had an Android phone in one pocket, I always had a keyboarded BlackBerry in the other.. I feel I've earned the right to look at the state of BlackBerry, and the need for keyboarded phones, objectively.). Let's remove personal preference for a moment, then. The keyboard, uniformly backlit, is excellent. Once you get the hang of it, the combination of touch typing and on-screen autocorrect works well. There are also a number of gestures that can be utilized to improve the typing experience, though I found myself more concerned with finishing a word than stopping to swipe up in one of three quadrants to extract an autocorrect suggestion.. As on the Priv, swiping to the left over the keys deletes the last word, while double-tapping on it introduces a cursor that can be used to quickly navigate through and edit text. I really like these gestures, and found myself not just using but relying on them as I spent more time with the KEYone.. When you're on the home screen, those keys double as shortcuts to basically anything, too: you can hold down the 'C' button to quickly launch the camera, or short-press the 'M' key to instantly call Mom (hey, it's Mother's Day soon — don't forget!). And when you're typing away, the physical Shift and Alt buttons mean you can quickly cut, copy and paste without digging around for that on-screen cursor. These are all great features, and add tremendous value to the hardware keyboard, especially once you grow used to the keys' nuances.. Typing on the KEYone takes some getting used to, even compared to older BlackBerry keyboards, and that's because BlackBerry Mobile decided to go glossy instead of matte on the buttons themselves. You'll want to make sure there's no oil or sweat on your fingertips, too, because once gunked the keys have a tendency to lose friction, and accuracy, in a hurry. A quick wipe with a microfiber cloth will do the trick, but like any physical keyboard, keep it clean lest you want to clean crumbs from under the frets in a few months' time.. After a few days with the keyboard, using it became second nature, and I returned to the rhythm I'd developed years before. But it's kind of like writing with a pen: you have to rebuild those muscles, physically and mentally.. With the current pre-production software, there is often a tiny but perceptible delay before both the first letter appears in the text box and the first autocorrect option appears at the bottom of the screen. It's almost like the keyboard is waiting for the software to figure out it's typing and, when it does, it snaps to attention and no longer lags. I'm hoping this is a pre-production gremlin and not something endemic to the phone, but software gremlins abound on the KEYone.. Running Android 7.1.1 Nougat is a good thing; promises of monthly security updates are even better. While the Priv is still stuck on Marshmallow, the two phones have remarkably similar software experiences, since BlackBerry has created a consistent aesthetic that leans closely on Google's Nexus and Pixel phones for art direction.. Here's what you get: a custom launcher that does most things right, including giving BlackBerry loyalists notification badges over icons and Android faithful the option of swapping in icon packs and swiping up to quickly access widgets. Practically everything else feels "stock" Android, from Nougat's unmatched notification experience — in-line replies for the win — to the host of pre-installed Google apps.. But BlackBerry (the Canadian company, not BlackBerry Mobile the hardware vendor — with me?) being BlackBerry, it has filled the KEYone with an armada of its own apps and services, punctuated by the Hub, a single place to consolidate all of your emails, texts, calls and social feeds, from Slack to WhatsApp to Twitter.. Hub would be close to perfect if it supported aliases. I can't use Hub as my main email client because it doesn't support aliases (the ability to send or reply to someone from an email different, but associated with, the primary address). It's otherwise so good at what it does, and addresses so many other pain points I have with many email clients today, including my service of choice, Newton. It supports rich formatting, customizable gestures, and has quick access to my calendar.. Everything you need to know about the KEYone's software features. BlackBerry's other apps do a damn fine job replacing Google's own versions, too; from the calendar to an excellent task manager, they're simple and well-designed, and leave no glaring holes compared to what you'd get on a Pixel or a Galaxy. And they sync with Exchange, so they'll work with your existing office setup. You do have to contend with BBM being pre-installed, but if you're going out of your way to buy a KEYone, you may also be one of the people maintaining a presence on BlackBerry's once-ubiquitous messaging service.. Notes and Notable, two similar-sounding apps that do vastly different things — the former is self-explanatory and the latter lets you annotate screenshots and photos — are examples of other value-adds that come pre-loaded on the device, and BlackBerry's DTEK software still keeps you apprised of your phone's security.. BlackBerry's apps are pretty great Google replacements. By default, BlackBerry still shows its so-called Productivity tab, a holdover from the curved edges of the Priv and a welcome addition to the software retinue. It's received a nice makeover here, though, with a full-screen overlay that offers a quick glance at unread emails, upcoming meetings and unfinished tasks.. From the very beginning, BlackBerry's take on Android won me over. Like OnePlus's Oxygen OS , there are just enough useful changes to Android to justify their existence, but they don't get in the way and never bog.. That BlackBerry is able to seamlessly blend its security and enterprise assets into a phone like this is admirable. The company boasts a number of security advantages over its rivals, like a constant check for hardware changes and a verified boot that ensures the software has not been tampered with.. Once booted, the phone is constantly scanning installed apps for traces of malware, and a fast rollout of Google's monthly security updates put it on the same footing as the Nexus and Pixel line.. To say that BlackBerry's phones are the most secure devices on the market may be a stretch — the Pixel will almost certainly benefit from having a newer version of Android, plus monthly security patches, while the KEYone languishes on Nougat for some time — but they are certainly among the most secure, and that counts for a lot in this day and age.. BlackBerry KEYone Performance and Battery. Running on the Snapdragon 625 platform with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, BlackBerry Mobile spent a lot of time at the phone's inception justifying the use of an older mid-range chip on a phone that, at $549, approaches flagship prices.. I've had great experiences with Android phones of similar pedigrees, in particular the excellent Moto Z Play. But when I first received the KEYone, I was shocked to see how much slower it seemed than that highly-optimized Motorola device. Indeed, not only was it occasionally difficult to type without lag, but apps would load slowly, menus would crawl as I scrolled, and the keyboard's smart scrolling would intermittently fail.. The good news is that after an update (the day before the review embargo lifted, natch), much of the grime disappeared, and the phone began running the way I hope it will when it reaches retail. Even on this new software build I'm going to save my definitive thoughts on performance until I received a retail unit with final software, since there are still areas where BlackBerry can tighten things. Still, the Snapdragon 625 chip inside seems to provide sufficient horsepower for the meandering tasks I submitted to it, including the occasional game of PinOut and Super Mario Run (my two mobile game addictions of the moment).. Even better is the battery life which, like the aforementioned Moto Z Play, spans days, not hours. The 3,505mAh battery is half of the equation, the other half being the power-sipping Snapdragon 625 and relatively low-resolution LCD screen. This is a great combination, and is sure to win power users over. Whereas a phone like the Galaxy S8 left with 10-20% at the end of a long work day, the KEYone often leaves me with close to 50%.. Much ado was made about the fact that the KEYone boasts the same 12 megapixel IMX378 rear camera sensor as the Google Pixel. But as we've learned countless times throughout the past couple of years, a smartphone camera is far more than its choice of sensor.. The KEYone can take great photos, and does a good job outdoors and in situations with moderate light. The combination of a sensor with large 1.55 micron pixels and a relatively wide f/2.0 aperture provide the right ingredients, and even on Auto mode I took some remarkable shots, including some photos at dusk that I'll treasure. Same with macros, even though the minimum focus distance is a little far for my liking.. It's indoors, in artificial light, where the Snapdragon 625's aging image signal processor, and the phone's lack of optical image stabilization, rear their combined Hydra heads. A surfeit of grain and poor white balance make barely-usable photos, especially when a moving subject is involved. This isn't unique to the KEYone, but given that the phone has, on paper, the same camera potential as the Google Pixel, it shows just how far the right software tuning goes.. BlackBerry does have a pretty great camera-taking experience on its hands, though, with one of my favorite manual modes of any phone camera I've used. It's also really nice to have the space bar, which is always in reach of the thumb, double up as a shutter button.. The phone takes decent-yet-shaky 4K video at 30fps, too, and the 8MP front camera gets the job done.. BlackBerry KEYone As a phone. BlackBerrys were always known as stellar phones to, you know, make calls, and the KEYone is no exception. Not only is it easy to hold in one hand, the textured plastic back is exceptionally comfortable and grippy. Sound quality from the earpiece is superb, and calls made over Bell's network tended to be clear, sharp and agreeable to the other person.. Agreeable to me was the single downward-facing mono speaker, which to BlackBerry Mobile's credit continues a long line of superior audio experiences on smartphones bearing the brand.. Similarly, network speeds were blazing fast over Bell's network (the carrier will sell the KEYone when it's launched May 31 in Canada), reaching speeds of up to 150Mbps using carrier aggregation.. One of my favorite things about the KEYone is the ability to use the keyboard as a trackpad, to scroll through articles without having to touch the display. This was true of the Passport and Priv and it's true here, too. But the phone isn't otherwise usable in one hand, especially not for typing; my thumb doesn't reach the 'Q', 'A' and 'ALT' buttons when gripping the phone in my right hand, and because the keyboard is permanent there's no shrinking it down as on a virtual keyboard.. Want a keyboard? Buy this phone!. This illustrates a fundamental frustration I have with the KEYone. To some, its inflexibility is a selling point — the selling point — for a phone they've ostensibly waited years for. The long-awaited Android phone with a proper BlackBerry keyboard that yields no real compromises.. If you're that person, this is your phone. If you're curious about the KEYone and want to put aside your big-screen phone for one with a keyboard — to return home for a time — the privilege will cost you $549 and some retraining.. But cast aside the keyboard for a moment and look at the KEYone's other traits: it's not too dissimilar to a phone like the Moto G5 Plus , which in its most powerful configuration is just over half the cost of the KEYone.. Should you buy it? Only if you need a keyboard. On its own, the KEYone is a pretty good phone. It's also the best phone with a keyboard you can buy. The gulf comes from the fact that no one else is doing what BlackBerry Mobile is doing, and no company comes close to offering the combination of features, performance, battery life and a physical keyboard.. If the keyboard is important, you've probably already made up your mind. Buy the KEYone and live a happy life.. If you can live without a physical keyboard but still want that BlackBerry pedigree, skip the DTEK line and go find a Google Pixel. Then go download all of BlackBerry's excellent apps, including the Hub and Launcher, and enjoy your newly-redecorated home.. How does KEYone compare to the Priv?. BlackBerry has two Android phones with physical keyboards, and they're both great. But how does the new KEYone compare to the older Priv slider? Jerry Hildenbrand pits key against key.. Daniel Bader is the Managing Editor of Android Central. As he's writing this, a mountain of old Android phones is about to fall on his head, but his Great Dane will protect him. He drinks way too much coffee and sleeps too little. He wonders if there's a correlation.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

BlackBerry KEYone review: Vintage vibes and a modern OS. At last, an Android-powered BlackBerry that feels like a BlackBerry.. You've got to give BlackBerry credit for refusing to die. After the underwhelming launch and life of BB10, the company pledged allegiance to Android, whipped up a strangely cool slider phone , then farmed out production of all new BlackBerrys to external partners. The journey has been difficult to watch at times, but it seems like the transition is starting to pay off. After a pair of all-touch phones, BlackBerry and partner TCL have released the KEYone , heralding the return of the classic candy-bar-with-keyboard design.. The Priv was an ambitious attempt at a flagship,and the DTEK50 and DTEK60 were barely recognizable as part of the line. The KEYone, however, is the first BlackBerry in years to feel, well, like a BlackBerry. Surprise, surprise: It's a pretty great little phone, too. Fans will be glad to know the KEYone is the best Android-powered BlackBerry to date, but I don't expect this to move the needle for many others.. BlackBerry fans will dig the keyboard. Has the best camera of any BlackBerry. The keyboard doesn’t make sense for some. The third time really is the charm. The earlier Android phones BlackBerry made with partner TCL felt generic, but the KEYone is an impressive device that channels the style and functionality of classic models. Even better, the KEYone is a respectable performer with solid battery life. Throw in an excellent camera plus a satisfying keyboard and you’ve got the best Android-powered BlackBerry out there. Just know it’s not perfect: some shortcomings in software are just puzzling, and the market for a phone with a physical keyboard in 2017 is very limited. Ultimately, the KEYone is a great choice for BlackBerry fans and keyboard nuts, but just about everyone else can look elsewhere.. The KEYone is taller than any traditional BlackBerry, with a four-row physical keyboard scrunched beneath a 4.5-inch IPS LCD screen. It's almost the exact same size as a closed Priv, in case you were curious. There's a fast and functional fingerprint sensor here too, baked into the keyboard's spacebar. It might seem like weird placement at first, but it's actually brilliant -- my only problem was that I kept pressing the spacebar expecting it to act like a home button.. Gallery: BlackBerry KEYone review | 21 Photos. The top is a flat plane where you'll find a headphone jack and, below that, you'll spot the traditional notification LED near the 8-megapixel front-facing camera. All of that is wrapped in an anodized aluminum frame that gives the phone a reassuring feel without adding much weight, and its rounded edges make it comfortable to hold for long periods of time. Flip the phone over and you'll find a soft-touch rubber back speckled with dots and a 12-megapixel camera wedged into the top-left corner. The combination of colors and textures make the KEYone feel classic in a way, sort of like an old camera.. Toss in a re-mappable convenience key, a USB-C port and a microSD slot and you've got the KEYone in a nutshell. I've really got to hand to TCL and BlackBerry on this one: They made a remarkably polished smartphone unlike any other on the market. The KEYone manages to feel professional and productive, and it's proof that you don't need to wedge metal between panes of curved glass to build something that feels premium.. Display and sound Software and security Camera. When we review a device with a keyboard, it's Engadget tradition to write as much of the story as possible on it. I got three or four paragraphs in before giving up. For me, it all boils down to speed. As fast as I used to be on my trusty Tour , I'm orders of magnitude faster punching out text on a touchscreen now. The only way to access a virtual keyboard on the KEYone is to rotate the phone sideways, and even then, you'll then be reaching over physical keys to type on the screen.. If you put in the time, though, the keyboard is mostly excellent. The keys are small and have just the right amount of travel, and silvery bands separate the rows to keep your fingers from mashing multiple keys at once. Even better, every letter key on this keyboard can be mapped to two shortcuts — you can invoke them by tapping a key or holding it down. This just might be my favorite thing about this keyboard: I can just tap "I" to get my Instagram fix or hold "L" to hail a Lyft.. This isn't any regular keyboard, either. For one, it doubles as a capacitive touchpad, just like the keyboards on the Passport and Priv. That means you can swipe on the keyboard to scroll through lists and web pages, but that doesn't mean you should. The keyboard seems less adept at tracking fingers when held vertically since there's less space for your finger to move, so you're usually better off just using the perfectly good touchscreen.. In my experience, the swipeable keyboard only ever really comes in handy in two situations.The first is when you're holding the phone sideways. In that case, one of your thumbs is naturally resting on the keyboard anyway, and swiping up and down on that sideways keyboard seems more accurate. You could do this on the Priv, too, but holding the KEYone horizontally with one hand is infinitely easier than trying to hang on to an open slider. The second, and less silly-looking, is when you're pecking out messages.. A trio of suggestions automatically appear above the keyboard when you're partially through a word, and a quick swipe up throws the correct suggestion into the text field. When you're learning — or re-learning — how to use this kind of physical keyboard, these smart suggestions are crucial for bashing out messages quickly. Within hours of using the KEYone, the keyboard knew to suggest the word "Engadget" instead of "engage" and offered up correct spellings of names in my contact lists.. It's a little weird to be reviewing this after using the G6 and Galaxy S8 — the KEYone's display feels like the antithesis of those long screens. The KEYone's 4.5-inch LCD has a squarish 3:2 aspect ratio to help accommodate that physical keyboard. BlackBerry argues the addition of the keyboard means more screen real estate while pecking out messages, and that's certainly true. Whether that's a worthwhile trade-off is up to you — I'm not bothered by the smaller screen, but bigger is almost always better as far as I'm concerned.. These observations wouldn't matter if the KEYone's display sucked, but it doesn't. It's adequately bright even outdoors, and colors pop nicely. Viewing angles are solid too, no matter if you're holding the phone upright or horizontally. Is it the best screen you've ever seen on a BlackBerry? No (if that's what you're after look at the DTEK60), but it's more than good enough for checking your photos before throwing them on Instagram.. The KEYone's two speakers (one on the bottom next to the USB-C port and one up top) were similarly just alright. I spent the past few days using the KEYone as my primary music and podcast machine, and to my surprise, the phone pumped out respectable sound. The KEYone is roughly on par with the Galaxy S8 — raucous rock tends to get muddy on both but songs with brighter highs come out relatively clear.. This is the fourth time in two years we've seen an Android-powered BlackBerry, and honestly, little is new on the software front. Sure, the requisite updates are in place — the KEYone runs Android 7.1.1 — but just about all of the features and flourishes BlackBerry is so fond of are still here. Being a purist, I'd normally take exception to all the stuff BlackBerry shoehorned into the KEYone's software. The interface looks stock at first blush, but there's some serious customization going on. Firing up the app launcher, for instance, reveals three tabs that offer access to your installed software (duh), widgets and shortcuts to specific actions like "compose text message" and "add task". There are more than just system-level actions, too; with the right apps installed, you can add shortcuts that create new notes in Evernote or kick the KEYone into driving mode. To make things even more fun, you can map any of those shortcuts to the keyboard's letter buttons. Strangely, you can only map BlackBerry's first-party shortcuts to the convenience key that, well, just isn't very convenient. To our friends in Waterloo: Fix this.. The changes only get more pronounced from there. There's a Productivity Tab lurking on the right side of your home screen; tapping it brings up a handy view of upcoming calendar events, incomplete tasks, unread messages and favorite contacts. It's not quite as useful as Google Now, but I grew to rely on it for triaging work-related deadlines and conversations. The BlackBerry Hub is great for that too, mostly. It's basically just a unified inbox that collects messages and updates from across all your mail and social accounts.. Unfortunately, the Hub can get overloaded pretty quickly when you've got Twitter mentions, Instagram likes, emails, texts, BBM messages, missed calls and more occupying a single space. The ability to quickly sift through all your interactions at once is neat, but there's no simple way to clear these events in one shot. The best you can do is prevent certain apps from adding notifications to the Hub or creating a separate "view" that selectively funnels messages from specific apps to you.. At this point, we're mostly left with little tweaks. Swiping up on certain icons lets you view its associated widget in a pop-up window, which is way more useful than it sounds. You can install and manage different icon packs right out of the gate. The only major omission is a virtual assistant — there's no Google Assistant or Alexa or even a crappy proprietary BlackBerry assistant. Here's hoping that changes, and soon.. The list of little touches goes on and on, affirming BlackBerry's love for power users. For the folks who need that extra level of flexibility, the KEYone has you covered. According to the company, each KEYone has a hardware root of trust baked into it during the production process, and the devices are fully encrypted by default. You'd never be able to tell just by looking at the KEYone, though — to wrap your head around the phone's security, you'll have to pop into the DTEK app.. As always, it'll give you a rating that signifies how secure your BlackBerry is. My KEYone mostly hovered in "Excellent" territory and yours will, too... unless you hate PINs and install apps from outside the Play Store. More importantly, DTEK lets the really paranoid see how often apps access things like your contacts, microphone and location. And the results are often not what you'd expect. It's no surprise that Google Maps and Twitter have checked my location more than a thousand times in the past week, but I didn't think the DTEK app itself would have checked my location nearly twice as much. In the event you do find something funky, DTEK makes it dead-simple to manage app permissions. Will the average person ever do this? Probably not, but DTEK is a surprisingly understandable crash-course in mobile security, and it's absolutely worth a look.. Great image quality has never been BlackBerry's forte, but I've been pleasantly surprised by how good the KEYone's 12-megapixel main camera is. We've mostly got BlackBerry and TCL's choice of sensor to thank — it's one of Sony's IMX378s, which got rave reviews when it was included in Google's Pixel smartphones last year. Of course, part of the reason the Pixels' photos look as good as they do is because of some sophisticated image processing. The KEYone lacks those clever tricks, but it doesn't matter much: For the first time in forever, you can feel confident that whipping out a BlackBerry won't mean taking photos that suck.. Under decently lit conditions, the KEYone's main camera captures natural, well-detailed photos with all settings left on Auto. It occasionally struggles with exposing scenes automatically, mostly when you've got a lot of moving subjects on screen, but it's easy to mitigate with the always-there exposure slider. The sensor's 1.55-micron pixels make the KEYone a decent performer when things get dim too, though you'll notice a quite a bit of noise. Exposure aside, there are a few other issues to note.. The phase detection autofocus here locks onto subjects very quickly, but the option to have the camera focus before taking a photo is off by default. The end result? More motion-blurred shots than I wanted. Presumably, the company wanted to keep the camera working as quickly as possible, but the extra wait is definitely worth it. Having the camera pointed at a scene with multiple light sources also makes the focus system act slower than usual. It doesn't seem to happen all the time, though, and hopefully this'll get ironed out in a future software update.. Gallery: BlackBerry KEYone camera samples | 21 Photos. Performance and battery life BlackBerry KEYone Moto Z Play BlackBerry DTEK50 Galaxy S8 AndEBench Pro 6,836 8,347 5,758 15,888 Vellamo 3.0 3,253 3,314 2,741 5,519 3DMark IS Unlimited 13,654 13,514 9,529 36,806 GFXBench 3.0 1080p Manhattan Offscreen (fps) 9.8 9.8 N/A 54 CF-Bench 54,714 54,061 49,170 67,307 SunSpider 1.0.2: Android devices tested in Chrome; lower scores are better. The 8-megapixel front-facing camera is a capable selfie shooter, and its wide-angle lens makes it easy to squeeze multiple people into a single shot. Alas, it too has trouble nailing the exposure, leading to plenty of selfies with blown-out backgrounds. (In fairness, the color of my skin might make this more of a "me" issue.). The KEYone also shoots video in a host of resolutions and bitrates, ranging from 720p at 24fps to 4K quality at 30fps. The resulting footage comes out crisp and clean if a little on the dark side. It's not enough to make me want to give up the Galaxy S8 Plus, but it's damned good for a BlackBerry.. If you're into artsy photos, BlackBerry's camera app offers a handful of photo filters and effects, but serious shooters will get more mileage out of the manual mode. Fiddling with ISO, shutter speed, focus and more is instantaneous and quite helpful; I just hate that the option is hidden in the camera's settings menu rather than being a selectable camera mode.. The BlackBerry KEYone isn't a flagship-level device, so you shouldn't expect it to perform like one. After all, it's a very specific addition to the BlackBerry lineup, and squeezing extra power into a device this niche doesn't make much sense. Instead, BlackBerry and TCL tried to build a phone that doesn't skimp on performance while retaining the battery life of older models. Nestled inside the KEYone is a Snapdragon 625 chipset , an Adreno 506 GPU and 3GB of RAM — together, they helped the phone tackle my daily routine without trouble. This won't come as a surprise to some of you; mid-range chipsets and phones are getting better by the day, and we've seen this combination of components come together really well in devices like the Moto Z Play .. There's the occasional wait for an app to pick up where it left off, but it's never enough to make the phone feel sluggish. Things take a turn when it's time to fire up graphic-intensive games like Asphalt 8, though, where you'll notice frames dropping here and there. This is hardly a surprise; devices like the KEYone lend themselves better to productivity rather than play.. The upside of that modest chipset is excellent longevity. There's a 3,505mAh battery wedged inside the phone; that's just a hair bigger than the one you'll find inside the Galaxy S8 Plus, so there's little chance of being disappointed here. On average, I'd pull the KEYone off its charger at around eight in the morning, and it would often have close to 30 percent battery left by the time I tucked myself into bed. On nights when I neglected to charge the phone, I could squeeze close to another full workday out of the KEYone if I was careful about what I was doing. This is where Qualcomm's QuickCharge 3.0 tech comes into play — it wasn't quite as fast as advertised, but a half-hour charge typically got the KEYone back to 40 percent.. If you're looking for other smartphones with physical keyboards, your choices are limited. BlackBerry's design sensibilities were at their most ambitious with the Priv, which pairs a nice big touchscreen with a slide-out physical keyboard. The phone's build quality still holds up, but you'd have to deal with dated performance — the Snapdragon 808 running the show is years old at this point.. If you're a big fan of old-school BlackBerry battery life but don't actually need physical buttons to mash, there's always Motorola's Moto Z Play ($449). It packs the same Snapdragon 625 chipset and pairs it with a 5.5-inch 1080p screen and a 3,510mAh battery. BlackBerry's software tweaks are nice, but there's plenty to like about the Z Play's almost stock Android experience. And if you're more concerned about power than security but still absolutely need a physical keyboard, you might want to consider something like Samsung's Galaxy S8 ($750) when its official keyboard case ($60) becomes available. I'm honestly not sure why Samsung keeps making these cases, but hey — the S8 and S8 Plus are the best Android phones you can buy right now.. I really, really didn't expect to like the BlackBerry KEYone. Sure, I have a lingering attachment to this once-great mobile brand, and I do like a good underdog story. Putting those highly personal things aside, though, and we're left with an objectively great smartphone. Of course, given the years of experience nearly all of us have when all-touch devices, I have to wonder if anyone accustomed to tapping glass would make the move back.. That's not really BlackBerry and TCL's concern, though. This phone won't make a BlackBerry believer out of anyone who wasn't already. For these two companies, the mission was to build a device that blends the best of Android with the hallmarks of BlackBerry devices long past. And you know what? They did it. If you're hunting for a new smartphone and you've ever loved — and I mean loved — a BlackBerry before, the KEYone is well worth considering.

Jaime Rivera May 17, 2017 8:59 am. This is not just about the Keyboard. The BlackBerry KEYone gets a ton of things right for those looking for a communicator.. Qualcomm MSM8953 Snapdragon 625 Octa-core 2.0GHz Cortex-A53 Adreno 506. 4.5-inches (~55.9% screen-to-body ratio) 1080 x 1620 pixels (~433 ppi pixel density) IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen Corning Gorilla Glass 4. 32GB microSD, up to 256GB. 12MP, f/2.0, phase detection autofocus 1/2.3'' sensor size, 1.55µm pixel size 8MP, f/2.2, 1.12 µm pixel size, 1080p. Hardware Software Camera Performance Pricing and Availability Conclusion Related Videos. By now I think it’s no secret that I’ve been using smartphones since their inception. I’d even rewind that statement another five years or so, as things really began with PDAs for me. Surely today I have the opportunity to discuss my opinion about them, but before joining Pocketnow, mobile devices were the tools that enabled me to get my job done, and they still do today.. That specific turning point where I upgraded from using a PDA I could only connect every now and then, to a truly connected smartphone actually has a name. I know many of you might not remember this, but we have to thank BlackBerry for creating the concept of a fully connected communicator. It wasn’t the first to try it, but it definitely was the first to figure out the essentials just right. It was really the first time that the internet walked with you 24/7, as your phone was not only fully connected, but that thing lasted all day no matter how often you used it.. This alone became so viral that we even had names for people that became addicted to their BlackBerries. It’s the main reason why I’ve carried two phones ever since, starting with my beloved BlackBerry Pearl doing tag team with my old HP iPAQ h1940. I think I would’ve continued using BlackBerry after the Bold 9700 if it wasn’t for how much of a disappointment BlackBerry 10 was.. Fast forward to 2017 and yes, things have changed dramatically. People don’t communicate any less than before, but companies have shifted priorities. Phones have become dramatically larger and more cumbersome to operate, all for the sake of content consumption. I’m not going to sit here and call the shift negative, but we all know that sending a text with one hand is no longer something easy to do.. As a result, BlackBerry has decided to join forces with TCL to change that. Instead of giving you a product that’s cumbersome at one thing and great on another, the BlackBerry KEYone tries to strike a balance in between. A phone that’s designed for communcation, but good enough to help you consume content.. Has BlackBerry achieved its goal in 2017? Read our full BlackBerry KEYone review to find out!. So what things are essential for a communicator? First it has to be easy to handle since you will be handling it a lot, and second, it has to last all day no matter what. The KEYone is actually both, even if taking a step away from your standard Android smartphone.. It’s built of sturdy aluminum that´s met with a grippy texture at the back and a mix of curves and flat finishes at the top and bottom. At a glance it’s definitely unlike any smartphone in the market today, and it doesn’t feel that way either. At 149 mm in height, 72 in width, and 9 and a half in thickness, and 180 grams in weight, the KEYone isn’t out to win any thin and light contest. On the contrary, the texture at the back hints to a device meant to achieve its first goal of being easy to handle, as it definitely is quite comfortable in the hand.. To achieve the second goal, the KEYone pulls on some inspiration from its legacy. The added thickness is most likely to house its large 3505 mAh battery. It’s choice for internals are also more in line with that of a premium midranger, given the added power efficiency of the Snapdragon 625 processor, since again, this device values endurance more than content consumption.. It’s display is actually just a hair smaller than your standard iPhone 7 at 4.5-inches, and brings the same IPS LCD technology at 3×2 aspect ratio. Color is as accurate as LCDs usually are with decent blacks, and it’s also efficient enough to bring an ambient display with your notifications. Bellow it we also have the famous BlackBerry QWERTY keyboard. It was designed different from previous BlackBerry devices, though. Instead of the matte finish of old, it’s now glossy in order to provide a uniformed look with the reflection of the screen. It also has a few genius additions, like a fingerprint scanner on the space bar, and capacitive navigation gestures to allow you to use it as a trackpad.. And as for the second goal, my week of testing has proven that battery life is just epic. My first couple of tests allowed me to go two days without a charge, and bare in mind, my job is to use my phone pretty much all day.. One of the key ingredients to achieve this great endurance is the inclusion of Android 7.1.1, as close to stock as possible. I say close to stock because visually it is, but it is very loaded with a ton of tools that help you communicate more efficiently.. For starters the launcher allows widgets, but you kind of don’t need them. If you see three points at the bottom of any app, swipe it up or down to reveal the app’s widget, and that widget is actually customizable. If you still want regular widgets you can find these in the app tray, in addition to a third tab for programmable short cuts.. And speaking of shortcuts, you can either press or press and hold any keyboard element to launch an extra one, for a total of up to 56 short cuts, though these sadly only work from the home screen. The only one that really works all the time is the one you set on the convenience key on the right. I’ve actually disabled the short press short cuts. I find it more convenient to just start typing and have the KEYone perform a device search.. The BlackBerry Hub continues to play a major role on this phone, as the one place you come to receive all your communication, instead of needing to fumble from one app to the next. This is definitely my favorite feature as you can be selective of which accounts fall on the hub. I just wish it had better Gmail integration for the swiping action when wanting to archive. To complement the Hub, the Productivity tab at the right allows you to view your day from any screen, and act on specifics within it.. I’m sad to report though that BBM is dead. Like seriously the last time any of my old contacts was seen online is two years ago. Sad to see that platform go. And then there is everything else, which pretty much looks like stock Android, and where the Pixel is mimicked, like in the case of the ambient display for notifications, and the launch of the Google Assistant by hard pressing the home button. Missing though are essentials like a Blue light filter, which are no where to be found.. The camera is one of those stories I’m also glad to report on. The KEYone sports the same IMX 378 sensor we find on the Google Pixel, and that’s actually awesome. There isn’t that background work that the Pixel is able to achieve with HDR+, but the Pixel is actually a worthy contender for daylight photography in almost every scenario.. The 1.55 microns on the sensor even allow this camera to perform admirably in low light, though focus can be a challenge. There’s a setting to force the camera to not take the shot until focus is acquired, so you can pick your poison if you’d prefer it to take its time.. Pro tip: disable HDR at night, and watch Juan’s real camera review for more details. I will say I’m shocked at how well this camera stabilizes video even without the inclusion of OIS, something which is again, another very neat trick from its Google competitor.. Now all this bevy of custom software doesn’t seem to like its limited spec sheet. I wouldn’t call performance sluggish, but there is the occasional stutter when launching apps, or navigating within them. Ideas like typing a search from the home screen are great selling points for a persistent keyboard, but lag can hinder the experience as you can’t really tell if the phone is thinking or not. Even audio is not something Juan would consider stellar in his Real Audio review.. And as for that persistent keyboard, there are elements to love, and a sort of wishlist on my behalf. I find it genius to be able to use it for navigating between screens, and this fingerprint scanner is one of the fastest I’ve tested. I also love the swiping action for predictions, since these are on spot most of the time. And then my favorite would be that it’s multi-lingual without needing to switch languages. What I don’t like is more a personal thing, as it can feel kind of crammed compared to legacy blackberries. It’s also quite mushy when pressing if compared these older units. In my time of testing I have started to get used to it, but I do hope the KEYtwo will take over the rest of the chin in providing us with larger keys. Dear BlackBerry: since this is capacitive, how about having it detect typing without the need to press. As regaining muscle memory has been my largest learning curve.. One of the most polarizing arguments for the BlackBerry KEYone is its price tag. When you have devices like the OnePlus 3T rocking the most powerful specifications in the market at $439, and when you have other great premium mid-range alternatives from Honor and OPPO, asking for $549 for the BlackBerry KEYone is kind of much.. If you’re asking yourself the question, then this device is clearly not for you. This means you don’t care about the keyboard, nor the added security benefits behind the software. Endurance is probably not important for you either, since you know the more powerful a phone is, the less the battery lasts. BlackBerry has a defined niche of consumers that are looking for these features as an added value, and I since most of these are in the enterprise, I feel the price is ok.. To conclude, I think it’s important that we remember the main purpose of a communicator. Ergonomics and endurance are essential for someone that doesn’t want to be carrying a battery pack after a long day in the city, and in that respect, the KEYone nails everything.. There is a lot of genius behind the hardware, and a lot more behind the software that powers it all. For those of you who need a phone focused on content consumption more than communication, I can totally understand if you feel this device is not for you, because you’re probably right. And hey, if you still want the software on powerful hardware there’s the BlackBerry DTEK 60.. The BlackBerry KEYone is designed for the rest of us, who did feel nostalgic the moment we saw it for the first time. The die-hard professional in need of a work tool that’s quick to react, and that can last a full day, and then some. To them I say the KEYone is a very good device for the things that matter.. The fact that this phone is already running the latest version of Android is a good indication that my complaints about software will be ironed out soon… Because in absolutely everything else, this is going to be one phone I’ll have a hard time putting away.. + Great build quality + Great in-hand feel + Camera performance exceeded expectations + Software optimized for practical communications + Lots and lots of keyboard shortcuts + Unreal battery life. - Lacks stereo speakers - Software tends to stutter - Some variants are fingerprint magnets - Learning curve with the keyboard - Fingerprint scanner placement makes no logical sense - Specs are not on-par with the price. The BlackBerry KEYone is a unique offering in the sea of flat slabs that we find in 2017. It definitely has a niche, and we're sure that it'll perform well there, but it's interesting to see just how little this phone is about just the keyboard.. A true communicator needs to feel practical, include great software, and provide incredible endurance. The KEYone has really exceeded our expectations. It might just be a great device for anyone to consider, so long as you stop focusing on specs.. Android , BlackBerry , Phones , Reviews.

Updated 11:21 AM ET Thu, 4 May 2017. The BlackBerry KeyOne is the first phone built by TCL after a December licensing agreement. The KeyOne features Android and a full QWERTY keyboard. Fans of BlackBerry may like the return to a hardware keyboard, but we recommend other devices instead.. If you're among the dedicated few still attached to your BlackBerry , then listen up: We've been testing the BlackBerry KeyOne Android smartphone for the last few days, and we think you're going to like it.. One thing you should know: BlackBerry Limited doesn't build its own smartphones anymore. Instead, it licenses its name and hardware patents (including the beloved keyboard) to TCL Communications and provides the software — Android with a BlackBerry skin — while TCL Communications manufactures and handles sales and marketing of BlackBerry Mobile devices.. This is the first device launched by TCL Communications since it agreed to license the BlackBerry brand in December. The deal gave TCL a more primary role in working with the brand and BlackBerry hardware.. The KeyOne was introduced earlier this year and launched recently in Canada and will release in the U.S. next month for $549, completely unlocked, and on Sprint this summer.. Rock solid design and all the basics. The BlackBerry KeyOne feels like it was built by BlackBerry, which means TCL did a good job keeping things familiar. The highlight of the device is its hardware backlit keyboard, which some people apparently still want in a smartphone. The KeyOne also offers a 4.5-inch touchscreen display and a rock-solid aluminum body that gives it a premium feel and look.. I also like the dedicated convenience key, pictured above, which can be programmed to open almost any application. I set it to open my Google Now page, so I can view the weather, my package delivery statuses and other information provided by Google to Android users. Oddly, this button is placed below the volume keys, and I frequently mistook it for the power button.. That aside, there are other niceties, like a new USB-C port that most manufacturers have moved to. It's reversible, so it's easier to plug in if you can't see the port, and supports faster charging to juice up the phone quickly.. Speaking of the battery, I could get through a full work day easily and didn't have to charge until I hit the bed at night. I wasn't really spending my time watching movies or playing games though, and instead focused on emails, checking Twitter and surfing the web.. A few tricks exclusive to BlackBerry. The KeyOne has a few features you won't find on smartphones from competitors.. The spacebar doubles as a fingerprint reader, for example, and you can use the keyboard as a touchpad to scroll through websites. BlackBerry Hub provides an all-in-one home for your text messages, social alerts, emails, calendar events and more, which will be particularly useful to the busy executive or parent.. Todd Haselton | CNBC | Mabel. The camera snapped great pictures during my tests, which was a bit surprising since I don't typically expect much from BlackBerry cameras. It's the same module in the Google Pixel, but I still think that device takes clearer and more accurate pictures, likely thanks to Google's software tuning. The camera is quick though, which is an improvement over the BlackBerry Priv, the last Android smartphone BlackBerry launched with a full keyboard.. BlackBerry has always been known for its emphasis on secure communication — there's a reason it's still used by a lot of government customers — and the company's new plan is to sell you on the security of its software while turning the actual hardware over to TCL.. On the new phone, an app called DTEK monitors your smartphone security at all times and gives you a score on how secured it thinks your phone is. There are a lot of factors, like whether you let your phone automatically install apps from the app store, that can affect this rating. In general, it's easy to make sure you're in the green zone of security approval.. It won't really matter to most consumers, though. Google already protects apps in the Android Play Store to help prevent malware from spreading before you even download them. Competitors are locking down their devices more than ever before, too. Samsung provides similar enterprise-grade security options in its Knox software, some Android phones get monthly security updates and more.. The display is bright, though not as high quality as what you'd find on similarly priced smartphones (the colors don't pop as much, and it isn't as sharp). The processor is also mid-range for what you're paying. The phone seems snappy enough, but it doesn't support next-generation Gigabit LTE networks that will begin rolling out this year and are going to enable faster speeds for when you need to download a big file from the office or stream a video.. The BlackBerry KeyOne isn't water resistant like the latest phones from Apple and Samsung, either. That means you're more prone to damage if you accidentally spill water on it or get caught in a downpour waiting for a cab.. Also, if you're like me, you're probably used to typing on a touchscreen phone by this point. It's actually hard to move back to typing on a QWERTY keyboard. And unlike the BlackBerry Priv, which offered a software keyboard option, you have to stick to the hardware here. There just isn't enough screen space to type on a software keyboard (and the form factor doesn't make sense for one.). Final thoughts: Fine for keyboard die-hards. The good news is there isn't anything inherently wrong with the phone. Keys weren't popping off, for example, and I was able to place phone calls, download apps and go about my business just fine.. It's just that I always found myself turning to another device, like the new Galaxy S8, instead of the BlackBerry KeyOne.. Once upon a time, it would have been unfair to compare a BlackBerry to an Android phone or the iPhone, but now that BlackBerry has switched to Android, and as Samsung and Apple have continued to court the enterprise, the comparison is fair enough.. If you're among the dying breed of folks who long for the days of returning to poke-typing on a full smartphone keyboard, then by all means check out the KeyOne. If you don't look fondly upon that, as I no longer do, then consider a Galaxy S8 or iPhone 7.. 
For a limited time, Best Buy and Amazon are offering the KeyOne for $100 off. BlackBerry’s KeyOne is the best smartphone you can buy if you want a physical keyboard.. BlackBerry’s KeyOne is the best smartphone you can buy if you want a physical keyboard.. BlackBerry’s KeyOne is the best smartphone you can buy if you want a physical keyboard.. 3D Mark Sling Shot Extreme: 457. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. BlackBerry and TCL generated plenty of intrigue when they announced the KeyOne at Mobile World Congress in February. It’s always refreshing to see alternatives to the traditional all-screen smartphone design, and not many phones in this price range are still willing to offer a physical keyboard. There’s certainly a market with people longing for physical keyboards, even if it’s small, and the Android-powered KeyOne is a great choice. TCL is manufacturing the phone, but BlackBerry is in charge of software and updates — it’s all a part of the company’s new mobile strategy. If you’re worried, don’t be — as we found in our BlackBerry KeyOne review, the smartphone has all the qualities of traditional BlackBerry phones, including excellent battery life and a priority on security. But the key selling point here is the keyboard, because,. with its $550 price tag, there’s no other reason to buy the KeyOne.. The BlackBerry KeyOne runs against the current trend of wafer-thin phones with oversized screens. It’s thick, bulky, and has a smaller 4.5-inch display. We wouldn’t call it ugly, but the top edge that houses the front-facing camera and LED indicator looks a little dated, the backlit keyboard is too glossy for our taste, and the two-tone front isn’t especially attractive, either. Still, the phone is clearly designed for enterprise, and it just looks as though it’s meant to be a productivity workhorse. TCL has done a sound job in retaining. the familiar look of previous BlackBerry-made flagships.. We like how the top is flat with sharp corners, but the bottom is more rounded. We haven’t seen a design like this before in a smartphone. The back is minimal, elegant, and the rubbery texture offers extra grip when handling the phone. There have been complaints about the back popping off , which we have yet to encounter, but BlackBerry is offering replacement units for those affected, and is also strengthening the adhesive on the KeyOne’s display.. You’ll find the power button on the top left edge of the KeyOne, and the volume rocker on the right. Below the volume rocker, a Convenience Key acts like a handy trigger for your favorite app or shortcut. We wish Samsung would let us use. the Galaxy S8’s useless Bixby button like this.. A USB Type-C port on the bottom is surrounded by two speaker cutouts, but you wouldn’t know there’s more than one. Sound quality is only OK, and it. doesn’t get loud enough for blasting music.. Typing with a physical keyboard feels more satisfying.. The capacitive navigation buttons above the keyboard are more nuisance than convenience. They’re easy to accidentally press when typing, and hardly offer any haptic feedback. They should have been placed below the keyboard, or TCL should have just opted for on-screen keys.. The exceptionally well-built KeyOne feels like a brick — in a good way — as though it will be able to survive accidental drops easily. But fair warning: The keyboard seems to collect dirt between the key rows, and so does the bezel around the rear camera, so you’ll need to clean them often.. By packing 1,620 x 1,080-pixel resolution into merely 4.5 inches, the KeyOne’s sharp LCD display hits an impressive 433 pixels-per-inch. It doesn’t seem to get as bright as we’d like, but we didn’t have too much trouble reading the screen in broad daylight.. The weird resolution and screen size mean that videos play with giant black borders around them, making the content look really small. It’s watchable, but big-screen phones like the Galaxy S8. are much better devices for TV and movie fans. Playing games is a little awkward as well, because you’re ignoring a quarter of the phone. Heavy mobile gamers will want to look at the same alternatives.. Performance is acceptable on the KeyOne, but we experienced the occasional stutter, and random app freezes.. Switching between the KeyOne and the Google Pixel, we also noticed moving through the Android 7.1.1 operating system is not as fast or smooth on the KeyOne. That’s most definitely due to the less powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor powering the KeyOne, as opposed to the Snapdragon 821 on the Pixel.. As a reference, here are a few benchmark scores.. The Moto G5 Plus , which uses the same processor, scored a 463 in the 3D Mark test, and 63,190 in AnTuTu. The KeyOne scores negligibly lower, but you should expect comparable performance.. We managed to play games like Tiny Archers, and Alto’s Adventure with no problems — and the device hardly got warm. We would have still liked to see a better processor, considering the Moto G5 Plus has the same chipset and costs under $300. There’s 3GB of RAM in the KeyOne, which is on par with many devices in its price range and it should be enough to handle multitasking. You also get 32GB of internal storage, and there’s a MicroSD card slot in case you want to add more.. As of September, TCL is offering the BlackBerry KeyOne Black Edition in select markets. Not to be confused with the Space Black version available exclusively from AT&T, the Black Edition is more than just a color makeover — it sports 1GB of extra RAM, taking it to 4GB, and 64GB of internal storage, instead of 32GB. The bad news is that it’s limited to Europe, Japan, Canada, and parts of the Middle East for now.. The KeyOne runs the latest version of the Android operating system, 7.1.1 Nougat, and it’s fairly close to stock. Like a Motorola phone, there are some design changes, but you’re overall getting a look that’s close to what Google established on its Nexus devices.. One improvement is a Recents button that brings up a grid-layout of recent apps, rather than Rolodex-styled vertical cards (you can change this to whichever you prefer). You can even install icon packs from the Google Play Store with the default launcher.. KeyOne feels like it’s built to withstand the apocalypse.. The KeyOne is all about choice. You can choose what to trigger with the Convenience Key, you can use the LED notification if you want, and best of all, you can customize shortcuts for every key on the keyboard to open any app — there’s hardly a need for the app drawer. These are intuitive, simple to configure, and one of our favorite features of the KeyOne.. Long-press the G key to open Gmail, for example, and you can set a short-press to open Google. There are even more specific shortcuts, like “write a note,” but these seem to only work with BlackBerry-specific apps.. Speaking of which, there are a lot of pre-installed BlackBerry apps, like WorkSpaces, a Google Drive alternative; the famous BlackBerry Messenger; BlackBerry Hub, which shows all your notifications in one place; Password Keeper, which stores your passwords in one secure location; and more. Some of these apps are genuinely useful, and it’ll come down to preference if you want to use these over your traditional favorites. You can disable these apps if you don’t want them, but you can’t uninstall them.. Similar to Samsung’s Edge panel, BlackBerry has a Productivity tab you can drag out from the right edge of the screen, and it offers quick access to. your calendar, Blackberry Hub, Tasks, and contacts. It mostly relies on you to use BlackBerry’s apps, but it’s still useful.. There’s also the DTEK By BlackBerry app, which monitors your device security by continually performing a safety check. It scans every app you install for malware, and recommends certain steps to keep your device safe, such as using a screen lock. You can even see detailed information on what permissions apps are using, and when. Best of all, BlackBerry is promising to deliver on Google’s monthly security updates, and it’s one of the few Android manufacturers following through.. The KeyOne presents an excellent, thoughtful Android experience for BlackBerry fans that are reluctant to hop on the company’s latest smartphone, or just anyone seeking an Android smartphone with a physical keyboard.. The keyboard is the reason you’re buying the KeyOne, and it’s excellent. Typing will take longer than a day or two to get used to, but we found ourselves typing more accurately, especially since the built-in autocorrect is reliable.. We experienced the occasional stutter, and random app freezes.. In most apps, a predictive bar pops up above the capacitive buttons with useful suggestions that make typing quicker. Pro tip: You can swipe up on the left, center, or right side of the keyboard to choose the predicted word, saving you an extra step.. You also don’t need to rely on emoticons over emojis — tap and hold the button left of the spacebar to activate keyboard settings. A bar will pop up above the predictive words, allowing you to choose Android emojis, paste from your clipboard, access the keyboard settings, and trigger voice typing.. Tap Alt to use numbers and symbols, and double tap it to continually use them. The same applies to the Shift key and Caps Lock. You can also use the keyboard to swipe and scroll through screens — it works pretty well, but we prefer the touchscreen.. The spacebar doubles as a fingerprint sensor — you don’t need to press it down, just place your fingerprint over it and it unlocks your device quickly. We prefer fingerprint sensors on the rear, but had no issues with the KeyOne’s placement.. You’ll most certainly need a few days to get used to the keyboard, so don’t dismiss it if you’re first impressions are mixed. After a week, our opinion was far more positive — typing with a physical keyboard feels more satisfying. Does it mean we’ll stick to physical keyboards from here on out? No, touchscreens are definitely faster, but it doesn’t mean the keyboard shouldn’t have a place. Looking for more keyboard tricks? Check out our handy guide .. The 12-megapixel rear camera is surprisingly good. Our photos captured fine detail, and colors were fairly accurate, though the latter suffered in low-light. There’s no optical image stabilization, so you have to be very still when taking photos in low-light environments if you want to avoid blurry shots. The standard camera app offers options for filters, HDR, and slow-motion video. There’s even a manual mode you can trigger in the settings, if you want more granular controls.. The KeyOne’s camera’s only fault is autofocus; it seems take too long trying to focus on certain objects. We hope it’s fixed in an update, but regardless we’re pleasantly surprised by the camera. It’s no Google Pixel or Galaxy S8, but. we believe most people will be more than satisfied with the outcome.. The front-facing 8-megapixel camera is capable, best in broad daylight, but not noteworthy.. The KeyOne’s battery will last longer than a Galaxy S8, and far longer than a Google Pixel , making it another standout feature. It’s all thanks to the 3,505mAh battery, the smaller screen, and the Snapdragon 625, which has excellent battery optimization, allowing for more than a day of battery life.. With medium to heavy usage, we started with a fully charged KeyOne around 8 a.m., and consistently ended with 40 percent remaining by midnight. Most flagships smartphones end up around 30 or 20 percent by 7 or 8 p.m., but not the KeyOne — it’s a trooper. You most definitely can get a full day and a half with heavy to medium use, which includes watching a few videos, streaming music, browsing social media and news, and playing a few games.. The KeyOne also supports fast charging through a specific mode that pops up whenever you plug in a charger. You can choose to charge the device like normal, but Boost Mode will essentially put your phone on airplane mode so it can charge faster.. The BlackBerry KeyOne comes with a standard one-year limited warranty that covers manufacturing defects. Accidental drops and water damage are not included under the warranty.. It’s priced at $550 unlocked in the U.S., and is sold in two unlocked configurations: one for GSM networks like AT&T and T-Mobile, and one for CDMA networks like Verizon.. If you want the phone a little cheaper, you may be able to if you purchase it from Best Buy or Amazon. For a limited time only, BestBuy.com , select Best Buy stores, and Amazon. are offering the GSM and CDMA variants of the phone for $450 — $100 off its regular retail price. sale will run until supplies last but officially ends at 9:59 p.m. At launch, the KeyOne could only be bought in a combination of black with silver trim. AT&T now offers a special Space Black color that’s exclusive to the carrier. Although it looks exactly the same, it’s not to be confused with the higher-spec. Limited Edition Black variant manufactured by Optiemus Infracom and released in India earlier in August, or the TCL-manufactured Black Edition. that hit Europe, Canada, and a few other markets in September. Those devices have an extra gigabyte of RAM for a total of 4GB, as well as double the internal storage, at 64GB.. A bronze version of the KeyOne is also available in select international markets — it was announced at CES 2018 — and it adds Dual-SIM capabilities to the phone.. BlackBerry’s KeyOne offers an excellent keyboard, where every key can act like shortcuts for apps and actions. It has more than a day of battery capacity, and is equipped with a capable rear camera. Our only issues are the KeyOne’s occasional performance hiccups, as well as the high price tag in relation to its specs.. Yes, there are devices with similar specs and lower price tags — such as the Moto G5 Plus. or the Moto Z2 Play. But the reason BlackBerry and TCL can get away with the KeyOne’s $550 price tag is because there are hardly any smartphones with good keyboards.. Anker Astro E1 5200mAh Portable Charger. If you’re worried about durability, the KeyOne feels like it’s built to withstand the apocalypse. BlackBerry is also promising monthly security updates, and we hope that extends to Android version updates. We expect this phone to last two to three years in terms of updates, and longer for durability.. It’s not water-resistant, so be careful to leave it behind before going for a swim.. Want a physical keyboard? The KeyOne is one of few options, but it’s great. The keyboard is chock-full of handy features, the phone will last you more than a day, it has a relatively clean software experience, and it’s secure thanks to the company’s promise of monthly security updates.. Update: Added news about the BlackBerry KeyOne bronze color option that also has a Dual-SIM slot.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.
