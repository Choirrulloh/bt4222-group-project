My family and I just completed a complete kitchen renovation and I got some great new things, but I have to say that this sink may be my favorite (as well as my husband and son's). It's deep, but not too deep. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a larger stainless steel sink. I can fit large pans in it, multiple plates, glasses, etc. I can even polish large silver items in it.. Just got my Toto Neorest 550h. The prices from Kitchen & Bath Authority were unbeatable and considerably less than I was quoted elsewhere.. I've gotten great service and quality from kbauthority for several years now, always friendly customer sales people and fast delivery. Best price on delta products fast delivery !. Me and my husband ordered Delta products for two of the bathroom remodels that we are doing ,products arrived in about a week packaged really well and I got the best price possible on the web so very very happy!!! definitely recommend this company to others for any home remodel project. Great Service, quick delivery time and as described.. We ordered two shower doors both came in about a week, the driver allowed us to inspect the products which was in good condition. Overall good shopping experience would recommend this company.. Got exactly what i needed and came in real fast love this place. Never had a problem on any order.. I was looking for a 12" towel bar and all the stores on town only had 18" bars. I went online and found just what I needed at KBAuthority.com, the towel bar arrived through the mail, in less than 1 week, and is exactly what I was looking for.. We were looking for Robern mirrors. KB Authority had them for half price. Ordering was easy and delivery was on time, within 2 weeks. We spoke with customer service several times to verify the order was moving along as the ability to follow the progress on line was somewhat limited. some time ago I ordered a shower door and asked for help from cust service which worked out well.I ordered a bath/shower door last week and it arrived super fast and well packaged.. I definitely have KBA on my list for future purchases.. Our Franke instant hot gave out on us after 16 years and we had to get a new one. Looked all over for the one we wanted and found it on the KBA website for the best price. Not only was the price right but the service and quick delivery made the difference. I will keep them on my "Favorites" for any future needs.. Excellent customer service, quick order and receiving as promised.. I initially had difficulty actually placing my order, however by using the chat, my issues were quickly resolved. I always do a lot of research on price and shipping before buying. I was very impressed on the packaging. There was no way my sink was going to be damaged by mishandling.. Ordered a Franke sink with inserts. Delivered in less than 2 weeks. I ordered $1000 worth of bath fixtures from KB. Loved the interactive chat to confirm i ordered all the right parts. Post-sales communication was so-so - I ended up having to call to confirm the ship date - but probably slightly better than expected given prices 5% or more below competitors'.. Best Price on Delta Shower Fixtures. Searched and found this to be best price on Delta venetian bronze shower set for bathroom remodel, even with modest handling fee (which was probably less than the actual shipping cost). No issues with packaging or shipping time.. Ordered a bunch of Hansgrohe stuff for our new home. We made a few changes throughout the process and customer service was very accommodating.. Great Communication - Best prices - Quick delivery. I ordered a vanity, sink, faucet and other accessories. They had the best prices of any on line seller and no sales tax on the order due to out of state shipping. I estimate I save at least $300 by using KBAuthority. My only issue was with UPS - The weight of the contents was too much for the contents and the box was split open upon delivery - no damage to the contents but a concern.. I had also sent an email with a question and got a response back the same day. I had forgot to include my coupon code and asked if it could still be used. The representative applied my coupon and adjusted the price. Overall very good shopping experience Thank you!. Second time ordering, same great service. This was my second order with this company, everything arrived on time and packaged well! I have another bathroom remodel and will use kauthority.com for the third time.. I hesitated to make such a large purchase (shower doors) online, but given the same product was available at a handful of retailers I trust for MUCH MORE, I took a breath and trusted this would work out. Being protected by Google helped me make the leap. Arrived quickly, all parts intact, and the final product looks perfect in my bathroom. I'm a believer in KBAuthority, and now a returning customer..

Information about the number of pixels per centimeter (ppcm) or per inch (ppi) of the display. The higher the pixel density, the more detailed and clearer is the information displayed on the screen.. The color depth of the display is also known as bit depth. It shows the number of bits used for the color components of one pixel. Information about the maximum number of colors the screen can display.. The estimated percentage of the screen area from the device's front area.. Information about other functions and features of the display.. Sensors vary in type and purpose. They increase the overall functionality of the device, in which they are integrated.. Digital cameras use image sensors for taking photos. The sensor characteristics are some of the main factors determining the quality of the camera integrated in the mobile device.. Aperture (f-stop number) indicates the size of the lens diaphragm opening, which controls the amount of light reaching the image sensor. The lower the f-stop number, the larger the diaphragm opening is.. Focal length is the distance in millimeters from the focal point of the image sensor to the optical center of the lens. A focal length, which results in the same field of view on a full-frame (35 mm) camera, is also provided.. Cameras of mobile devices use mainly a LED or a Xenon flash. The LED flash has a softer burst of light and in contrast to the much brighter Xenon flash, is used for recording videos as well.. One of the main characteristics of the cameras of mobile devices is their resolution, which shows the number of pixels on the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the image.. Information about the maximum resolution available for shooting a video with the device.. Information about the maximum number of frames per second (fps), supported by the device while recording a video at maximum resolution. Some of the main standard frame rates for recording and playing video are 24p, 25p, 30p, 60p.. Information about additional software and hardware features of the privamery camera, which improve its overall performance.. Information about the maximum image resolution of the secondary camera. Often, the resolution of the secondary camera is lower than the one of the primary camera.. Information about the maximum resolution available for shooting a video by the secondary camera..
