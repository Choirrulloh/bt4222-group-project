Motorola Moto E Dual SIM phone in black. White earphones with microphone for hands-free calls. Instruction manuals in English and Hindi. Travel/Wall charger with non-removable micro USB cable. Cannot install apps directly to the SD card. After the most successful Moto G that was launched in India earlier this year, Motorola released another budget smartphone called Moto E at a price tag of just Rs. 6,999, even cheaper than the Moto G. Unlike the Moto G, the Moto E was launched in India first and is also cheaper compared to some markets. Looking at the specifications, it is clear that Moto E is worth the price. Did it live up to its expectations? Let us find it out in the complete review.. We unboxed the Moto E earlier this month. Check out the unboxing video below.. The Moto E has a similar curved design as the Moto G. It has a 4.3-inch (960 x 540 pixels) IPS display at 256 ppi pixel density with scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. It also has anti-smudge coating that prevents fingerprints. The Moto G’s display was one of the best in the range, and the Moto E doesn’t disappoint either in its price range. It has good viewing angles and the sunlight legibility good too, but it has a slight yellow tint in white backgrounds and the viewing angles are average.. Blacks are deeper on-par to the Moto G’s display. Considering the price tag, this is definitely a pretty good display on a smartphone compared to other smartphones in this range since most other OEMs offer low-resolution display with low pixel density.. On the top there is a earpiece with chrome finish. There is also a LED notification light that glows only in white color, similar to Moto G. On the other side there are the usual set of proximity and ambient light sensors that are hardly visible due to the black bezel. The phone lacks a front-facing camera, so if you looking to capture selfies, you’ll be disappointed.. It has on-screen buttons for controls and there is a large loudspeaker grill below the screen. This too has a chrome finish, similar to the earpiece. Since both these have gaps, these gather dust easily.. The Moto G was wedge shaped with curves on the sides, making it pretty thin on the edge, but the Moto E looks more rounded on the sides. It is 12.3mm thick, bit thicker than the Moto G. The power button and volume rocker placement are similar, and have chrome finish. Between the bezel on the front and the back cover, it has a shiny plastic finish, exactly similar to Moto G.. On the bottom there is a micro USB slot. Since the phone doesn’t come with a micro USB cable separately, you need to get a separate cable to connect the phone to a PC for data transfer.. On the top there is a 3.5mm audio jack and a tiny microphone hole. Motorola has done a great job by offering secondary microphone even at this budget.. The back cover has a matte finish and houses a 5-megapixel fixed-focus camera module. The Moto E also has water repellant coating, similar to Moto G. The phone weighs 142 grams, almost similar to Moto G, but the device feels bulky due to its design. The matte back also offers a nice grip when holding the phone.. Unlike the Moto G’s fingerprint-prone back cover, the back cover in the Moto E better and hardly attracts fingerprints. As you can see it is curved on top almost similar to the Moto G.. The back cover it a bit hard to remove and it loosens up after you remove and replace it for a few times. Removing the back cover reveals the sealed 1980 mAh battery.. Motorola sells rear shells separately in a range of colors. It has dual SIM support with two micro SIM slots on the sides, similar to Indian variant of the Moto G. It also has a microSD card slot that was not present in the Moto G. This is mainly due to low internal memory on the phone. Overall the Moto E has a pretty good build quality.. The 5-megapixel fixed-focus is below average. It has very few features such as HDR, Click to set exposure, Panorama, Geo tagging and option to turn off shutter tone. Daylight shots are decent, but it doesn’t offer much details. Since it is a fixed-focus camera, it is not possible to capture macro shots. Since it lacks LED flash, low-light images are full of noise. Check out some camera samples below.. Check out more Moto E camera samples here .. It can also record videos at a FWVGA (864×480 pixels) resolution at 30fps. The video is surprisingly better compared to the images. It also has a secondary microphone so that the audio is crisp. You can check out the complete review of the Moto E to know more about the camera in detail.. Coming to the software, the phone runs on stock Android 4.4 (KitKat), similar to Moto G, so there is nothing to mention about the software in specific. The Moto G was initially launched on Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean) and received an update to KitKat in a few weeks. Offering stock Android for a Nexus-like experience makes users choose Motorola smartphones over other competitors. Motorola has also promised that the Moto E would get at least one update (Android 4.4.3 likely) in future.. The Moto E has 1GB RAM and about 460 MB of RAM is free when the phone is idle, with only the default services running in the background. Out of 4GB of internal storage, you just get 2GB of usable storage.. The microSD card slot supports cards up to 32GB. You can also move supported apps and media to the SD card easily, but it doesn’t have an option to directly install games to the SD card. This prevent you from installing large games to the memory card. When you try, it shows a warning that memory is full, even though the SD card has a lot of free space.. Motorola has also added Motorola Alert , an exclusive app for Moto E that lets you send periodic notifications with your location to people you have added. This is definitely an useful app, especially for women. The phone also comes pre-loaded with the usual Moto Assist app with Meeting and Sleeping actions. It also has the usual set of Google apps and utility apps.. It has the default Google Play Music for music playback. The front-facing speaker is decent and the bundled headset could be better. It has FM Radio with RDS, similar to Moto G. It lacks FM recording, but it has option to play via speakers. It can play 720p HD videos smoothly, but can’t handle 1080p videos.. It has Dual SIM options in the settings that lets you customize each SIM cards. There is a connection priority option that lets you choose Data or Voice. If you prefer Data, when you receive incoming calls on the non-data enabled SIM, it will go to voicemail when data is active. If you choose voice, then data will be stopped when you are on a call on a non-data enabled SIM. The SIM card is not hot swap, unlike Moto G. You need to restart the phone every time you insert a new SIM card, but removing a SIM doesn’t require a restart.. It has 3G HSPA+ (up to 21Mbps), WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 LE, GPS with GLONASS and BeiDou. It doesn’t have USB OTG support like the Moto G. This is acceptable since this has an expansion slot.. It is powered by a 1.2 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 (MSM8610) processor with Adreno 302 GPU. Compared to the performance of the Moto G with quad-core Snapdragon 200 SoC, this is decent. Thanks to the stock Android and 1GB RAM, multitasking is smooth without any lags. Browsing some websites slows down the phone a bit since the processor is not powerful and the phone gets heated quickly on 3G usage and gaming. Check out some synthetic benchmark scores.. It scored 5296 points in the Quadrant Benchmark.. In the AnTuTu Benchmark 4 it managed to score 12455 points.. It managed to score 1195 points in the Vellamo 2 HTML5 browser benchmark. Check out the complete set of Moto E benchmarks here .. Coming to gaming, the smartphone has a 400 MHz single-core Adreno 302 GPU. Most games were smooth, but some games had occasional frame drops. Graphics was decent, but some games took a lot of time to load. Check out the Riptide GP2 gameplay.. Check out the gaming review to know more about the phone’s gaming performance in detail.. As Motorola promises, the 1980 mAh battery last for more than 24 hours with mixed usage such as video and audio playback, few image captures and some gaming. As you can see, with all these and screen time of close to 5 hours it still has 10% of charge left. This is based on single SIM usage and might vary with dual SIM usage. It also has battery saver option that turns off background data and WiFi when the battery is low that lets you prolong the battery life bit more.. Moto G set a benchmark as one of the best smartphones under Rs. At a price tag of Rs. 6,999, Moto E is definitely one of the best budget smartphones under Rs. The smartphone is already popular and is on huge demand in India, so it is not surprising that other OEMs are competing with Moto E by releasing new smartphones running Android 4.4 in the similar price range. If you are looking to buy an Android smartphone under Rs. 10,000, but can compromise on the camera and the lack of front-facing camera for stock Android experience and the display, go for it..

Home / Blog / The Best Dual SIM Phones. by Dan Forster - June 20, 2015 , Last Updated on April 15, 2015 , Buying Guides. The Motorola Moto G 2 nd Generation Dual SIM. The Motorola Moto E Dual SIM. The Nokia Lumia 630 Dual SIM. The HTC Desire 816 Dual SIM. Dual SIM phones have a lot going for them. They’re pretty much what you would expect: a device that allows you to run two SIM cards simultaneously. And as more and more people are wanting to run business and personal phones, dual SIM models are becoming more and more popular. It used to be that dual SIM hand sets were expensive and low powered, but times are changing, and there are some awesome dual SIM smart phones on today’s shelves. If you’re looking for a great phone that just happens to be able to run two SIM cards, then we’ve collected the best UK available models right here, so check out your best options…. The Motorola Moto G 2nd Generation Dual SIM. The 2 nd generation Moto G from Motorola is one of the best dual SIM phones on the market right now, and just goes to show that you don’t need to make too many compromises if you want a two SIM card phone. With classic Motorola design this is a full featured, 4G capable smart phone that will run both your SIM cards.. What kind of specs are we looking at here? The Moto G 2 nd generation runs a quad core 1.2 GHz processor and 1 GB of RAM, so it’s plenty speedy. You’ll be getting a full five inch display with tons of room for reading, typing and video watching. There’s a 2 MP front facing cam, and an 8 MP rear facing camera. The Moto G comes in two versions, one 8GB and one 16 GB, but both have an SD card slot for up to 32 GB of extra memory. All in all a very solid mid range phone, and one that will please even the most demanding user.. Samsung have long been king of the smart phone, and their flagship models often come in a variety of different incarnations. Last year’s best selling Galaxy S5 model happens to also come in a dual SIM format. Looking and feeling almost exactly like the original S5, the S5 Duos doesn’t come cheap, but it is an awesome phone. Be warned that the Duos is a little tough to find with UK operators, so you might need to hunt it down.. You will be getting a hearty quad core 2.5 GHz processor and 2 GB of RAM though, giving you awesome performance. There’s a 5.1 inch Super AMOLED display with stunning colour resolution. Camera wise you’re looking at a 2 MP front facing camera and a huge 16 MP rear facing cam. The Galaxy S5 Duos comes with 16 GB of internal memory, but an SD card slot lets you bump that up to a massive 128 GB should you need it. Pricey, yes, but this is a top of the line, high end smart phone, and might be worth the extra cash if you’re a big time phone user.. HTC too have been vying for the top end of the market with their One series, most notably the super powerful One M8 and M9 models. The One E8 is their contribution to the dual SIM market, and again this is a high end model with great performance and specs and a price tag to match. Design wise this is one of the slimmest and sleekest of dual SIM models, and is certainly a fashion statement.. The One E8 runs a quad core 2.5 GHz processor alongside 2 GB of RAM, so performance really isn’t an issue here at all. There’s a five inch LCD3 screen. The front facing camera on the E8 is a huge 5 MP, whilst the back is a more expected 13 MP. The One E8 comes with 16 GB of built in memory, and again an SD card slot for up to 128 GB of extra storage.. The Motorola Moto E Dual SIM. If you’re looking for affordability in a dual SIM phone then the Motorola Moto E should be right up your street. A fully touch screened smart phone, the Moto E is basically a budget version of the Moto G, and that means big savings for you.. You’ll be getting a dual core 1.2 GHz processor and 1 GB of RAM, so this isn’t the highest powered of phones, though performance is still pretty snappy. There’s a 4.3 inch screen, making the Moto E nicely portable. There is no front facing camera though, and the rear has only a 5 MP device. You’ll get 4 GB of built in memory, with an SD card slot for up to 32 GB of extra storage should you need it.. The Nokia Lumia 630 Dual SIM. If you’re not looking for an Android then your dual SIM options are a little limited, but Nokia do make a range of dual SIM Lumia phones, though specs aren’t quite as high as we’d really like to see. The Lumia 630 dual SIM is probably the best of the bunch, and it’s a brightly coloured and affordable device that runs Windows 8.1 out of the box.. The Lumia 630 has a quad core 1.2 GHz processor on board and 512 MB of RAM, meaning day to day performance is solid, though there are no lightening fast speeds here. The display is 4.5 inches, and again there’s no front facing cam only a 5 MP rear facing device. The 630 comes with 8 GB of built in storage, but an SD card slot offers the possibility to add up to 128 GB of extra memory.. The HTC Desire 816 Dual SIM. Finally, the HTC Desire 816 dual SIM is maybe one of the best bargains around, packing some impressive specs into a mid range smart phone. You still get that beautiful slim-lined HTC desire, but the Desire 816 is much more affordable than the HTC One E8.. There’s a quad core 1.6 GHz processor and 1.5 GB of RAM, giving you some nice speeds, good responsiveness and excellent multi-tasking. There’s a huge 5.5 inch display, making the 816 more of a phablet than a traditional phone. The front facing camera gets a large 5 MP resolution, whilst the rear facing camera gets 13 MP. And there’s 8 GB of built in memory, with an SD card slot to take that all the way up to 128 GB.. As dual SIM phones become more popular we’re going to be seeing dual SIM options become standard. But right now these are by far your best bets if you’re looking to run two SIM cards on one phone.. Twitter Facebook Google+.

A dual-SIM phone makes it possible to have two different phone numbers without carrying two separate phones, which can be desirable for those who keep separate business and personal lines. Such phones also help those traveling abroad to avoid roaming fees, as a local SIM card can be used to supplement an existing line. The top rated dual-SIM Android phones are commonly variants of popular single-SIM. Available in different models and offering a variety of features, shoppers can easily find the right dual-SIM Android phone to fit their budget and needs.. Like the single-SIM Moto G, the dual-SIM Moto G features a 720p 5-inch display, quad-core Snapdragon processor, and 8 MP camera. Its two SIM slots accept micro-SIMs. One of the few modifications to the Android OS running on the Motorola Moto G is a dedicated dual-SIM setting for managing two different cellular networks.. The dual-SIM Moto E is a budget-friendly Android phone with impressive hardware and features. With a 4.3-inch screen, dual-core Snapdragon processor, and 5 MP camera, the Moto E Dual-SIM is the entry-level Android smartphone to beat.. A well-received flagship smartphone, LG gives the G3 a second look with the LG G3 Dual-LTE. Both phones share the same hardware, including the powerful quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor, 1440p 5.5-inch display, 3 GB RAM, and a 13 MP camera with laser autofocus. The LG G3 Dual-LTE supports two SIMs that connect to 4G LTE networks.. The original HTC One M8 stands out thanks to notable features such as its all-aluminum body design, dual front-facing stereo speakers, and dual 4 MP rear cameras. The HTC One M8 Dual-SIM adds support for a second nano-SIM card to the M8's impressive list of features.. Like the HTC One M8 Dual-SIM, the HTC Desire 816G Dual-SIM also accepts two nano-SIM cards. Although it looks as impressive as the M8, the Desire 816G Dual-SIM features a different design. It packs a 5.5-inch 720p display, quad-core or octa-core processor, and a 13 MP camera with LED flash.. Samsung adds a second micro-SIM slot to the Galaxy S5 to make the Galaxy S5 Duos LTE. Both phones have the same dimensions, chip types, storage capacities, and camera resolution. In addition, the Duos LTE variant is water and dust resistant and comes with a fingerprint sensor.. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Duos features a 5.7-inch 1440p Super AMOLED display, impressive stylus, and a blazing fast Snapdragon 805 processor. It shares the same hardware as the single-SIM Galaxy Note 4 except for its 16 GB internal storage and 3000 mAh battery.. The thin Sony Xperia X3 Dual smartphone houses a long lasting 3100 mAh battery and two nano-SIM cards. Its 1080p 5.2-inch display is bright and beautiful. The phone features a quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor, 3 GB RAM, and a 20.7 MP camera inside its sleek, waterproof body.. Unlike most dual-SIM Android phones, the Lenovo Vibe X2 Pro has no single-SIM variant. It accepts two nano-SIM cards, sports a 1080p 5.3-inch display, and runs an octa-core 64-bit Snapdragon processor. It features a 13 MP camera and works with Lenovo's Vibe Xtension Selfie Flash; a flash ring with eight LED bulbs that plugs into the audio jack..
