It has been developed by the 3GPP and its major advantage is the provision of greater bandwidth and spectral efficiency, due to the W-CDMA technology.. LTE is deemed to be the fourth generation (4G) of mobile communications technology. It has been developed by the 3GPP based on the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies in order to increase the speed and capacity of wireless data networks. A further development of the technology is called LTE Advanced.. There are several network technologies that enhance the performance of mobile networks mainly by increased data bandwidth. Information about the communication technologies supported by the device and their respective uplink and downlink bandwidth.. Information about the operating system used by the device as well as its version.. Name and version of the user interface (UI) used by the operating system (OS).. The SoC integrates different hardware components such as the CPU, GPU, memory, peripherals, interfaces, etc., as well as software for their functioning.. Information about the process technology used in manufacturing the chip. The value in nanometers represents half the distance between elements that make up the CPU.. CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM..

Aperture (f-stop number) indicates the size of the lens diaphragm opening, which controls the amount of light reaching the image sensor. The lower the f-stop number, the larger the diaphragm opening is.. Cameras of mobile devices use mainly a LED or a Xenon flash. The LED flash has a softer burst of light and in contrast to the much brighter Xenon flash, is used for recording videos as well.. One of the main characteristics of the cameras of mobile devices is their resolution, which shows the number of pixels on the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the image.. Information about the maximum resolution available for shooting a video with the device.. Information about the maximum number of frames per second (fps), supported by the device while recording a video at maximum resolution. Some of the main standard frame rates for recording and playing video are 24p, 25p, 30p, 60p.. Information about additional software and hardware features of the privamery camera, which improve its overall performance.. Digital cameras use image sensors for taking photos. The sensor characteristics are some of the main factors determining the quality of the camera integrated in the mobile device.. Aperture (f-stop number) indicates the size of the lens diaphragm opening, which controls the amount of light reaching the image sensor. The lower the f-stop number, the larger the diaphragm opening is.. Information about the maximum image resolution of the secondary camera.

HTC Desire 728 Ultra price, review and specifications. The Taiwanese giant HTC have announced their Ultra Edition of HTC 728. This handset is expected to nourish HTC’s presence in the mid-range market. Talking of its traits, it sports a 5.5-inch HD (720x1280 p) IPS display mounted on a plastic body. It is powered by a 1.5GHz octa-core MediaTek MT6753 SoC mated with 3GB RAM, Mali-T720MP3 GPU and 32GB of onboard Multimedia storage (expandable up to 2TB via microSD card). HTC 728 Ultra Edition uses a 2,800 mAh battery to fuel its components. Also, the chipset supports fast charging to replete the lost battery juice in no time. On the photography front, it flaunts a 13 MP (f/2.2 aperture) rear shooter aided by LED flash. For the sake of Selfies, it exhibits a 5 MP (f/2.8 aperture) front snapper. It comes loaded with a Photo Editor that features Double Exposure, Face Fusion and more. And notably, it packs decent dual frontal Boomsound speakers that support Dolby Audio for an immersive audio experience. The handset runs HTC Sense UI based on Android 5.1(Lollipop) which is upgradable to Android 6.0(Marshmallow). HTC 728 supports dual SIM cards and as connectivity options, it features 4G, Wi-Fi (both Direct and Hotspot), Bluetooth v4.1, GPS, A-GPS, GLONASS and microUSB 2.0. Considering the price, this handset misses out some key ingredients like a metal chassis, full HD screen, and the unavoidable Fingerprint scanner. You can opt for HTC 728 Ultra if you are looking for a reliable brand tag. HTC 728 Ultra Edition price in India is marked at 16,490 INR..

For last 2 years, I have been using an HTC Desire 816 and was quite satisfied with its performance. Before that, I have used Sony, Nokia, LG, and Samsung but was never really happy with those phones the way I was with HTC. Recently when I decided to change my phone, I was quite sure that I will go for HTC again. To be quite honest, it was the only phone that lasted 2 years in my hands, others ones could barely make it past one year. Checked out a few models and finally narrowed down to HTC Desire 728 Ultra edition. Below is a short review after using this phone for about a month now.. HTC Desire 728 Ultra Edition Review. I believe this phone earlier came with a 2GB RAM and 16 GB inbuilt memory. Recently they launched this ultra edition after bumping up the RAM to 3GB and internal memory to 32 GB. The color that I bought it in was cappuccino brown, which actually was the only color available at that time. It did not really matter to me because after putting on the tamper glass and back cover, color of the phone anyways remains hidden.. Design: Nothing with the design that stands out really. One look at it and you will know that it is an HTC phone. It pretty much follows the same design that probably is most common in smartphone these days. It does however have a very neat finishing and looks stylish. Build quality is decent enough but needs to be handled with care. Its quit light weight and as a matter of fact, my VIVO 5 inch display phone feels heavier that this.. Display: Nothing to complain about in this aspect. It offers a 5.5 inch 720p HD display which works quite well for me. Sunlight visibility, contrast and color resolution is average.. Performance: No lags, stutters or hanging problem at all. This phone works perfect even at time of playing heavy games and multitasking. It does start to heat up a little if you keep it in your pocket while talking to someone using earphones for a long duration.. Camera: While the rear camera takes good enough pictures in broad daylight or good lighting conditions, it tends to disappoint in low lighting. The front camera on the other hand is quite impressive and takes good selfies but that too can get difficult in low light as there is no flash on the front.. Sound: This probably is my biggest complain with this phone. For some reason, HTC still continues to offer those old style ear plugs that are very uncomfortable. Use this and your ears will start hurting within 15 mins because of which I had to go buy Sony earphones to go with this phone. The speaker on the phone however has good volume and is quite loud enough.. Battery: It is powered by a 2800mAH battery and can last an entire day easily with mixed usage of internet, gaming and calling. Charging the battery can take up to 2 hours from 0 to 100%.. Connectivity: This phone only takes nano sim cards and is 4G supportd.. Final Verdict: In the end, I would say that I am quite happy with HTC Desire 728 Ultra edition. My use is limited to calling, texting, internet and some light games and this phone serves the purpose very well. I would definitely recommend buying it..
