Motorola Moto E4 (USA) - user opinions and reviews. Rooted and debloated, I got this for the primary function as a pocket wifi tablet. Modded away the 'no sim' and 'high volume' warning nags, there is very little left of anything resembling a phone. It's an awesome little pocket tablet. No service, just $59 bucks on sale and rooted/modded right away. My personal opinion is this is very good phone budget phone superb battery timing tasking is good sound quality is ok front camera better then rear camera every thing i perfect only one disvantage speaker is only one and rear camera quality not good but in this price is okkkkk ... I have my moto e4 us since August and its working fine. I am writing because I would like to let you know today my phone received two updates: September 1, 2017 and November 1, 2017 security patch level. Until today the security patch level was only May 1, 2017. I have an unlocked version, and because of I moved back to my country (Hungary), I use this nice device in Europe. I also tested the mobile network antenna. In German cities even 4G is working fine with T-Mobile, because the phone is compatible with B7 4G network. Unfortunately B7 is not a widely used frequency in EU (B3 and B20 is more frequent), so at most of the places you can achieve only 3G or HSPA/HSDPA+ networks. The speed is about 5-10 Mbit/sec for 3G/HSPA/HSDPA+ and 40-50 Mbit/sec for B7 4G networks, respectively.. Ricardo, 19 Oct 2017 Is the LCD 5.0"? i know its 5.5" IPS Capacitive touchscreen. I think you may be thinking of the Moto E4 Plus. The E4 is 5", the E4 Plus is 5.5". Is the LCD 5.0"? i know its 5.5" IPS Capacitive touchscreen.. Vijaymano, 17 Jul 2017 This phone support for Indian bands???? This will support some Indian cellular hands. It won't support Jio4g as jio is being operated at band 40 of 4G and this device doesn't support band 40. Even 3G (HSDPA/HSUPA) will work with most of the Telecom providers.. Anonymous, 18 Aug 2017 Or if you want a good main phone (I've had smartphones for 10 years and never needed a backup)... more Agree nuts esp when they flogging it off with crappy CPU in other countries...for $220......its insane price 2 gig ram fingerprint I got myself one to cheeeeeeeeeeeeep! if i lose it no big deal.. jojobirdy, 23 Jul 2017 NOPE! If you want a cheap but good backup phone without spending a lot of cash, the Moto E4 is... more Or if you want a good main phone (I've had smartphones for 10 years and never needed a backup) you can't beat the Moto E4. $40 bucks at Walmart for the Verizon version and around $2 for an unlock code on ebay and you're good to go on ANY GSM network.. Fine phone, a bargain with upgrade or number transfer or new customer ($49). Specs should note that the WLAN, WiFi is dual band 2.4 & 5.0. Abhi48, 14 Jun 2017 Instead of this, we should buy the e4 plus or any xiamoi product at this range. NOPE! If you want a cheap but good backup phone without spending a lot of cash, the Moto E4 is it. The moto e4 plus has some problems anyways.Go to the motorola site to find out more about its issues.. This phone support for Indian bands????. Anonymous, 19 Jun 2017 Why is usa getn snapdragon n the rest of the world mediatek. Injustice !! Because the USA still has CDMA networks (Verizon, Sprint) that is only supported by Snapdragon chipsets.. Why is usa getn snapdragon n the rest of the world mediatek. I have had Moto E2 for a couple of years now and if the new E4 performance is comparative to the E2, with updated improvements of course, it should be an excellent phone. My Moto E2 is a great phone, reliable and well built.. This phone has comparable price with Wiko Harry, this phone advantage over Harry is that this phone using new Snapdragon chipset at 1.4GHz, fingerprint (on some region), Gorilla Glass protection and larger 300mAh batter however Harry has also advantage over E4 and that is being large RAM with 3GB and higher resolution camera at 13MP and metal design. Instead of this, we should buy the e4 plus or any xiamoi product at this range. With price of 140 eur or less shoulld be good otherwise i wont reccomend it.. If priced competitively,the phone is not half bad... Total of 18 user reviews and opinions for Motorola Moto E4 (USA) ..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great protection and easy button action. Color: 2# Rose | Verified Purchase. I tried several cases for the Moto E4, and like this one the best. The buttons, rather than just being soft bumps, have a precise action and are easy to use. The dual-layer plastic protects the phone well, and it was easy to install. The surface adds a lot of grip to the phone.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Good purchase and the price is right. Color: 4# Black | Verified Purchase. Fits perfectly! It does what I wanted a case to do. It offers some protection from drops and makes the phone easier to hold. I do not know why the phone manufactures cannot make a phone less slippery. Good purchase and the price is right.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Just received this today and it is awful. Color: 4# Black | Verified Purchase. Just received this today and it is awful. Extremely slippery to hold and Amazon says it's not returnable. I am just throwing it away. I wanted a silicone like case that is not slippery. This case was also very hard to get off the phone. * EDIT * I took off the hard plastic outside and the rest is soft silicone rubber with buttons still there so much better.

Can the FM radio chip in RW’s Moto E4 be activated without interfering with RW’s proprietary software/firmware? If so, what is the safest way to activate the chip?. There is no Republic proprietary firmware on the Moto E4 or any other 3.0 phone. Republic’s blended WiFi/cell service is implemented entirely in the Republic 3.0 app.. The above said, there was never any conflict between Republic’s service and FM radio chips said to be in various Republic supported phones. It’s always been solely the manufacturer’s choice to enable (or not to) that chip. For what it’s worth, according to GSM Arena , the Moto E4’s FM radio chip is already enabled. Is that not the case for your E4?. For what it’s worth, according to GSM Arena, the Moto E4’s FM radio chip is already enabled.. Have you checked your app drawer for the FM Radio? That’s all I’ve need to do with my phones. I have an E4 in my hand right now, and the FM radio is enabled and functional.. I don’t yet have a Moto E4, but I notice that MANY GSMarena.com specs for cell phones list the presence of an FM chip. From what I’ve read, it’s up to the carrier that sells it to specify to the manufacturer whether to supply the FM chip as activated or not, and virtually all cell phones sold by carriers until this year don’t have the chip activated. T-Mobil, for instance, announced last Fall that the new model cell phones that it would sell in 2017 would have the chip activated. But that hasn’t started, yet, for some unknown reason. It’s good to hear that the Moto E4, at least the version sold by RW, has the FM chip activated.. Did you buy your Moto E4 from RepublicWiress?. @southpaw is a Republic staffer. I’m quite confident she acquired her E4 from Republic directly.. I’m unable to speak to what you’ve read about carriers specifying to manufacturers whether or not to enable the FM radio chip. I can say no phones currently sold by Republic including the Moto E4 is specifically manufactured for Republic. They are North American factory unlocked variants unmodified by Republic in any way. An E4 purchased from Republic is no different than an E4 purchased from Motorola directly or other 3rd party merchant. I am using the E4 that RW sells and it is activated on RW’s service. Unlike our legacy phones, the phones we now sell do not have proprietary operating systems.. Here’s the app in the app drawer, first row, 2nd column:. When you launch, it explains that quality will be better with a wired headset plugged in:. When you’re tuned into a station, there’s some info on the screen about the station you are listening to, or the song playing, (depending on what info the station provides).. I turned off Wi-Fi, and as you can see, I don’t have a cellular signal at my house. When you launch, it explains that quality will be better with a wired headset plugged in:. No reception unless headphones plugged in and I’m unable to use phone’s or a BT speaker. Do you know of any setting to disable the headphones or a workaround. Plug in the headset so it can work as an antenna.. Tap the speaker icon shown at the bottom left of the 94.7 screenshot I posted above. Audio will play on the phone’s speaker phone.. I turned on my previously-paired Bluetooth headset and audio moved from the phone’s speakerphone to the Bluetooth headset.. And now, I’m turning it off. I can only take so much of Today’s Best Country.. Now I can find some thing laying around here to use as a nice shorter antenna and take real advantage of my FM Radio…. Thank you, southpaw and rolandh for the info, and especially to southpaw for the screen shots and the reply about switching to speaker mode.. Oh, BTW, here is just one reason why I, and perhaps others, had to ask:. Motorola Moto E4 price, specifications, features, comparison. It lists in the Moto E4’s specifications (under “Connectivity”) that there is no FM.. Motorola Moto E4 smartphone with 5.00-inch 720x1280 display powered by 1.3GHz quad-core processor alongside 2GB of RAM and 8-megapixel rear camera. Motorola Moto E4 price, specs, NDTV's Rating, Motorola mobile phone review at NDTV Gadgets360.com.. And as was pointed out, this conflicts with GSMarena:. both of which say that there is “FM radio”.. Thanks, very similar to what I’ll likely use. I wonder if something like this would work. My headphones I use with my laptop do not work with the FM radio on Moto E4. I can use them as an antenna, but I actually want to hear the radio on my headphones. Do you have a case on the E4 that may be preventing the plug from going all the way in?. And BTW, they are not really headphones, just some earbuds, but I don’t think that should matter, right?. Powered by Discourse , best viewed with JavaScript enabled.
