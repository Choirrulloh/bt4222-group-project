I bought this mobile as I wanted to buy desi brand.The mobile is very good for the looks. But the mobile sometimes shows a blank screen. It is when we play games. So restart it after playing games. 2.It has dual camera and dual flash too.I could take beautiful selfies. 3.The piece of mobile that I have bought had to be replaced as the first piece had a problem with blue tooth. The blue tooth was always connected. When ever we tried to switch off the blue tooth the mobile used to reboot. But this one is working well. If you want the dual sim to work for 4g+4g then this will not. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Value for money.. The product came with a bug where it's bluetooth is always on and when you turn it off, the phone restarts. Essentially, you just can't turn the blurtooth off.

Making both, feature phones as well as smartphones, their focus always has been to make affordable phones for the masses. Lava is now recognized as a brand to be reckoned with in the mobile market.. The Lava X19 is a mid-range phone with specifications to match. It is a perfect phone for those who are looking to buy their first smartphone. That means no Gorilla Glass, no fingerprint scanner, and no 4G. But Lava Mobile does support 3G, supports dual SIMs and is available at an attractive price. The phone is available for Rs. Let us take a review of this phone.. The Lava X19 is a beautiful looking phone with curved edges giving it a clean, cohesive look. The back panel is removable and gives access to the battery, the dual SIMs, and the memory card slot. The back panel wraps around the edges of the phone. This creates the illusion of a unibody device and gives it a premium, sophisticated look. There is Lava branding in the center of the back panel.. The speaker grill which is made up of drilled holes arranged in a rectangular pattern sits at the bottom. The round camera cut-out sits at the top and dual - tone LED flash is located below it. The camera cut-out is surrounded by a ring which is colour-coordinated to match the colour of the back panel and protrudes slightly from the back.. On the front, the three capacitive Android navigation keys sit below the 5.0 inch IPS LCD display. The selfie camera and the accompanying selfie flash are located on the left side of the earpiece. The volume rocker and the power button sit on the right edge of the phone. This is a good looking phone.. The Lava X19 has a 5.0 inch IPS LCD display sporting a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels with a pixel density of 294 PPI. The display is bright, with well-saturated colours and good viewing angles. Sunlight legibility is good and the display is easily visible outdoors.. Overall Lava X19 3G Smartphone is a good display at this price-point.. The primary camera on the Lava X19 is an 8.0 megapixels autofocus camera with dual-tone LED flash. This helps in rendering the skin tone correctly while lighting the whole scene. Pictures clicked under ideal lighting conditions and in ample light turn out good, with a decent amount of fine details captured. Photos clicked in low-light conditions display noise but are decent and usable.. The selfie camera has a resolution of 5.0 megapixels and has its own flash. This will definitely interest all those selfie-clickers out there. The same camera is used for video calls.. The Lava X19 runs on a quad-core Spreadtrum SC7731G processor clocked at 1.3 GHz. It is paired with 2 GB RAM and 8 GB of storage which can be extended up to 32 GB via the microSD card slot. The phone runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow right out of the box.. The phone breezes through the day-to-day tasks with nary a lag or hiccup, thanks to the 2 GB RAM. The 2200 mAh battery keeps the phone going for longer duration between two charges. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi, A-GPS, Bluetooth, FM radio and 3G network support. Sensors on the phone include Accelerometer.. 5.0 inch IPS LCD multi-touch display.. Bluetooth V4.0 and Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n with A-GPS support.. The Lava X19 is a mid-range affordable smart phone which runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow, features two high-resolution cameras, both with LED flash, and big display. All this is powered by a big battery. At the price which it is available, it is a good buy with excellent value for money.. Lava X19 Full Specifications.
