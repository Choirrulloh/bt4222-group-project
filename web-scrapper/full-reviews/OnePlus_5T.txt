Original: OxygenOS 4.7 (Based on Android 7.1.1 "Nougat" ). The OnePlus 5T is an Android smartphone designed, developed and marketed by OnePlus. It was unveiled on 16 November 2017 [4] via a live streamed press event which aired on YouTube , [5] and directly succeeds the OnePlus 5. It went on sale on 21 November 2017. You can help by adding to it. The OnePlus 5T features a redesigned 6.01" Full Optic 1080x2160 AMOLED display, which the company calls the "Sunlight display" and claims to provide a crisp and bright experience even when used in a sunny environment, such as when outdoors. The display uses the 18:9 (2:1) aspect ratio instead of the 16:9 aspect ratio found in most smartphones, and supports the DCI-P3 wide color gamut standard. It also has a pixel density of 401ppi, [8] and features smaller bezels than found in previous OnePlus smartphones such as the OnePlus 5 and 3T. The 5T's body is made entirely from anodized aluminum, uses 2.5D Gorilla Glass 5 as protection for the display, and uses a ceramic coating for the fingerprint sensor. [9] It also features an "Alert Slider" located on the left side of the device, a feature that is also available on its predecessors, the 5, the 3T, and the 3 , which allows users to set their notifications to silent. The 5T is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 and comes with the choice of either 6 or 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM, depending on the storage configuration. Similar to its predecessor, the phone is available in either a 64GB or 128GB configuration.. Unlike OnePlus devices released in the past, the phone does not feature any physical hardware buttons on the front of the device, electing to use virtual navigation keys instead. It features a non-removable 3,300 mAh battery, capable of fast charging by OnePlus' proprietary Dash Charge through its USB-C port. The phone retains the 3.5mm headphone jack , but lacks stereo speakers, instead opting for a mono speaker located on the bottom of the device. The device features a combination of a 16. MP main lens ( Sony Exmor IMX398 ) and a 20. MP secondary lens ( Sony Exmor IMX376K ) located on the device's rear, both of which have an aperture of f/1.7. They are capable of shooting 4K video and " Portrait mode " shots, like many other flagship devices. The front (selfie) camera is also a 16. MP sensor, with an aperture of f/2.0. The 5T features a "Face Unlock" facial recognition feature that can be used to unlock the device, however it lacks the ability to authenticate purchases. Since it uses 2D scanning, it is relatively faster than some other competitors , but doesn't work in particular lighting conditions and is not as secure. The OnePlus 5T has become available in multiple limited edition variants over time, such as a Star Wars edition promoting Star Wars: The Last Jedi , which came with a special case and a new color scheme; a "Sandstone White" variant which was released on 5 January 2018 and featured a white color scheme and a red "Alert Slider", which sold out in under 2 hours; [11] and a "Lava Red" variant which was released on 11 January 2018 initially in India, [12] [13] and became available in Europe and North America on 6 February. The OnePlus 5T ships with Android 7.1.1 "Nougat" and uses the OxygenOS user interface, OnePlus' proprietary custom skin built on top of Android, adding various features not found in the stock Android operating system, such as a night mode, a reading mode, which both change the color temperature of the device's screen, and the ability to change the Bluetooth audio codec. [15] The night mode reduces the screen's color temperature to reduce blue light levels, while the reading mode applies a monochrome-like effect to the screen. [16] Unlike the OnePlus 5, the 5T no longer uses performance scaling in benchmarks, and makes benchmarks being run on the 5T more accurate. OnePlus promised an update to Android 8 "Oreo" (OxygenOS 5.0) in early 2018. [18] The first beta for this version was released on 29 December 2017, but was pulled a couple days later due to issues with regards to unstability that were present. OnePlus fixed the issues and reuploaded the beta version on 3 January 2018. The first stable Android 8 "Oreo" based version of OxygenOS (OxygenOS 5.0.2) for the OnePlus 5T was released on 31 January 2018, introducing Android Oreo features such as Picture-in-Picture, Autofill, and Notification Dots, as well as a faster boot time. The update also introduces a redesigned Quick Settings menu, introduces a security patch for CVE-2017-13218, and updates a few system applications.

Update: OnePlus has released a special edition “Lava Red” version of the OnePlus 5T. You can buy the Lava Red OnePlus 5T here, while stocks last. Check out the pictures of the lovely looking Valentine themed device below.. This is the first time OnePlus has done a red phone and it looks great. Sadly the back isn’t the same grippy, sandstone finish as the previous limited white model. Everything else is the same as the regular OnePlus 5T: 8GB RAM, 128GB storage, Snapdragon 835 and two cameras. It might have only been released a few months after the OnePlus 5, but the 5T managed to stand up on its own and demonstrate why it was worth the quick turnaround. The biggest change for the 5T is the 18:9 display, which elevates the device to enable it to sit alongside more expensive flagships such as the Pixel 2 XL and Note 8.. Related: OnePlus 6 news and rumours. Since its launch, the 5T has stood the test of time well; although the update to Oreo was halted following reports that it resulted in issues with older devices. From what I’ve seen, Oreo works well on the 5T. Alongside basic Android 8.0 features – such as floating windows for video and notification dots – the UI has had a spruce up, with the Face Unlock function brought to older devices.. Battery life remains decent – although I’d expect nothing less after a few months of use – and there have been plenty of bug fixes from OnePlus to iron out previously annoying issues.. The OnePlus 5T remains one of the best phones on the market, and for the £449 starting price I don’t think there’s a better option out there. Of course, you could hold out for the OnePlus 6, but it’s unlikely we’ll see this before summer at the earliest. Other decent options include the Honor V10 and Nokia 8, but even among these, it’s the 5T that stands out for me.. Keep reading for a look at the now sold-out Sandstone White version (let’s hope that comes back soon) and the full OnePlus 5T review.. The OnePlus 5T is one of the best deals in tech, offering fantastic features for a great price. But it does come only a few months after the OnePlus 5 was released.. This quick release cycle shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone familiar with OnePlus, but it’s still a bit of a kick in the teeth to anyone who recently picked up a OnePlus 5. I think I’d be OK with the move if it was simply a phone to go alongside the 5, but the 5T completely replaces its now out-of-stock predecessor.. Timing aside, the OnePlus 5T is a predictably great phone. That’s because it takes everything that made the OnePlus 5 one of my favourites of 2017 and adds in an 18:9 display, reduced bezel and slightly improved secondary camera..

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. The OnePlus 5T is one of the best phones you can buy right now, made even better by the seriously competitive price. Initially it was only available in a fairly standard black hue, but that’s not the case anymore.. OnePlus has just announced a ‘Sandstone White’ version of the 5T, and it’s very nice. Not only is the white back a lovely contrast to the still black front, but the ‘Sandstone’ texture adds a hit more grip to a phone that could be quite slippery to hold.. The texture isn’t as coarse as the older OnePlus One and 2, but it’s still noticeable and certainly welcome. Other differences include a splash of colour in the form of a red alert-slider, and black volume and power buttons.. OnePlus says this is the most expensive phone it has ever produced, but it’ll still retail for the same price as the black version. It’ll only come in the 128GB storage/8GB RAM variety, though, so will set you back £499. Read on for our full OnePlus 5T review.. I really like the 5T’s industrial aluminium unibody design, even if it’s basically the same as the OnePlus 5’s. The edges are nicely curved, it’s not too big and it’s really thin.. Unlike with the 5, the 5T is only available in the Midnight Black hue, though I wouldn’t put it past OnePlus to release a gold or slightly lighter black variant later down the line. There’ll also probably be a partnership with some obscure fashion house at some point.. The biggest design change is that the fingerprint scanner now sits below the rear camera sensor, rather than on the phone’s front. OnePlus told me it went through multiple variations of this scanner to get it right and even tried colour matching it completely to the device, but in the end it stuck with the same ceramic construction as previous phones. The scanner itself is a tad on the small side for my liking, but it’s perfectly positioned just where your finger naturally rests.. The fingerprint scanner has been moved to the back because the front of the phone has been completely redesigned. Gone is the chunky bezel around the display, gone is the home button and gone are those capacitive keys that flanked it. Instead, you’ve got an 18:9 aspect ratio, 6-inch design running nearly edge-to-edge.. Having a 6-inch display in a body that’s only a hair taller than the 5.5-inch OnePlus 5 is an impressive achievement and real selling point for the 5T.. Screen changes aside, the rest of the OnePlus 5T is very familiar. You’ve still got that handy alert-slider on the left for quickly switching the phone to silent and the other buttons are as clicky and tactile as ever. The increasingly rare headphone jack remains on the phone’s bottom next to the middling downward-firing speaker and Dash Charge enabled USB-C port. You’ll also find a dual-Nano SIM tray on the 5T’s side. I’d have preferred a microSD slot, or a hybrid slot, but at least there’s a decent amount of base storage here.. Related: OnePlus 5T vs OnePlus 5. My biggest criticism is the lack of any official IP-rating for the phone. The majority of flagships these days are at least IP67 rated for that extra peace of mind. Obviously some corners have to be cut to allow OnePlus to sell these phones at such competitive price-points, but I just wish this wasn’t one.. For the price, you won’t find a better display. The OnePlus 5T uses a Samsung OLED. It’s a big, bright 6-inch panel with a slightly odd 2160 x 1080 resolution. This is classed as FHD+, but really it just adds extra pixels to the top so you don’t lose any sharpness with the elongated screen. This resolution doesn’t match the quad-HD panels used by some of the competition, even at this price-point, but the OnePlus 5T’s screen is sharp enough so you won’t be able to distinguish individual pixels. There’s also no support for HDR or Dolby Vision.. Unlike the OLED panels used in the LG V30 and Google Pixel 2 XL , the OnePlus 5T’s doesn’t suffer from wild oversaturation or terrible viewing angles. Yes; there is a mild shift to blue if you tilt off axis, but it’s only noticeable if you really go looking for it.. OnePlus lets you fiddle about with the screen calibration if you’re not a fan of the vivid default setting. I switched it to the DCI-P3 option and this levels out colours a bit without washing anything out. There’s an sRGB mode too, plus a custom setting with a slider for making the panel warmer or cooler.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network. 
CNET también está disponible en español.. A stellar phone gets an even larger screen. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The OnePlus 5T has a bigger screen and its camera takes better low-light photos than the 5. Its few software tweaks are useful in small ways.. The Bad The phone's face unlock doesn't authorize payments and its dual camera's digital rather than telephoto zoom is a step back. There's no expandable storage, and it's not rated for water resistance.. The Bottom Line The OnePlus 5T is a superb, affordable phone for new buyers, despite only minor changes from the OnePlus 5.. OnePlus 5T versus OnePlus 5: What's different?. Face unlock is new, but not secure. Better low-light camera at the expense of optical zooming. Editors' Note : This review was originally published on Nov. 20, 2017 and was updated on Nov. 29, 2017 with additional battery information and an Editors' Choice Award.. Its latest phone, the OnePlus 5T, pairs the right high-end hardware and software with the right price, making it one of the best value phones you can buy anywhere. It remains one of those rare devices that can take on phones with slightly brawnier specs and higher price tags like the Galaxy Note 8 ( $900.00 at Amazon.com ) and LG V30 ( $749.99 at Best Buy ). That price-to-value ratio is exactly the reason why the 5T, like the last OnePlus phones before it, is one of the best mid-priced phones you can buy and earned CNET's Editor's Choice Award.. It's not perfect, of course -- no phone is. One of the OnePlus 5T's biggest warts is that it's only an incremental hop from the OnePlus 5 ( $949.98 at Amazon.com ) we saw just five months ago. So, while the 5T is genuinely impressive for new buyers, anyone who already owns a OnePlus 5 can join me in a big shrug.. In fact, OnePlus 5 owners have a right to be annoyed that their phone is now "old news." (And OnePlus no longer sells the 5, so unless you're buying it through another channel, this is your only option.). OnePlus 5T: Bigger screen, same design. The 5T keeps much of the 5's internal hardware, including the processor, battery and headphone jack, which is becoming so endangered these days. But the screen and camera are what changed most. The 5T's 6-inch AMOLED display now takes up most of the phone face and OnePlus swapped out the 20-megapixel telephoto lens on its dual camera, replacing it with a lens for low light.. Incremental updates have quickly become the OnePlus way. In just four years, this Chinese brand has whipped up a fervent global cult following , based on undercutting the costlier competition. And while the OnePlus 5T isn't as cheap as the first OnePlus flagship in 2014 (when it was $299, or about £180 and AU$320 converted), it's still affordable.. (Keep in mind, however, that the OnePlus 5T launched during the holidays, when. and season in the US and elsewhere are underway. All of the best phones of the year will go through fluctuating sales and discounts during this time, and many older-but-still-great flagship phones can be bought at even bigger discounts, sometimes at even two-for-one offers. For a head start on deal-digging, check out CNET's Holiday Gift Guide for phones .). A few things, but not a lot. The most noticeable and really only envy-inciting difference between the OnePlus 5 and 5T is the 5T's larger display, which now measures 6 inches instead of 5.5. Because the bezels are thinner, the 5T's physical size remains relatively the same. On paper, it is a few millimeters taller and thicker, and about 0.3 ounces (9 grams) heavier, but I didn't notice a difference in my hand.. With the new size, the display's resolution is still just as sharp (pixels per inch hold steady at 401ppi), but the aspect ratio has gone from 16:9 to 18:9, the same ratio you see in Samsung's Galaxy S8 ( $597.42 at Amazon.com ) and S8 Plus, LG's V30 and G6, and the Google Pixel 2 XL ( $849.99 at Best Buy ). Some argue that this ratio offers a better, more comfortable viewing experience. But I like it because it gives you a larger canvas for doing all the things you usually do on a phone..

Using the OnePlus 5T's face unlock.. But not all face unlocking is created equally, and OnePlus 5T admits that its new feature isn't all that secure -- at least not secure enough for mobile payments. Samsung's Galaxy S8, S8 Plus and Note 8 have face unlock too, and they're not secure enough to authorize purchases through Samsung Pay either.. Still, face unlock does give you another way to unlock your phone, and ease some of that iPhone X FOMO. It works incredibly fast and recognizes over "100 facial identifiers" to unlock the phone, according to OnePlus. ( Read more : How to set up face unlock on the OnePlus 5T .). The feature worked when I wore glasses and sunglasses, and it was able to discern my real-life face from a 8.5x11-inch print out. It's a useful, time-saving method to unlock your phone, but that's pretty much it. OnePlus made some interesting changes to its dual-camera setup. There's still a 16-megapixel main camera, but what used to be a 20-megapixel telephoto lens now is a lens designed to take better low-light shots.. For camera fans, this secondary lens has the same focal length as the main camera, which means that you can still capture bokeh-style portrait photos, and there won't be any auto-cropping when you take them (something that the OnePlus 5 did). But because OnePlus widened the aperture on the second lens, night-time and lowlight photos look a lot more detailed. The downside though is that telephoto or "optical' zoom is gone, so all the zooming you do on the phone will be carried out digitally.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

more ... more .... more ... more .... by John Velasco. Android - Android + OnePlus - OnePlus +. 2017 can be argued as the year of the trends: from stretched-out 18:9 displays to dual-camera implementations to facial recognition security, all adopted by many of the flagships released this year. And you know what else they adopted? This crazy idea of ultra-premium pricing around the neighborhood of $1,000. However, there's a new phone that adopts all of these newfound qualities, and then some, but without the $1,000 price tag. Enter the OnePlus 5T : the latest high-end smartphone from the Chinese company. At first glance, it could be perceived as a minuscule update, coming only a few short months after the company's previous flagship – the OnePlus 5. But don't be fooled because if you look at the larger picture, it might astound you to know how the OnePlus 5T stacks up against the giants in the flagship space. In the box: Dash Power Adapter Dash Type-C Cable Silicone protective case OnePlus decals Safety Information Users Guide Design Being released so soon after the OnePlus 5 before it, it's no surprise that the OnePlus 5T doesn't deviate a whole lot from the design language that we're familiar with already. In fact, you could say that it's an exact facsimile, since it sports the same smooth metal construction and sloping edges. However, in order for it to fit a larger screen within only a marginally bigger footprint, its fingerprint sensor has been repositioned to the back – just a smidgen beneath the camera. The construction of the phone feels solid, suggesting that it doesn't have the fragileness of all these glass-meets-metal phones. In an era where many flagships implement the latter construction, the all-metal design approach of the OnePlus 5T feels refreshing. And it is just as much of a good-looker as most of the other phones it's competing against. Generally speaking, it's a recycled design with a few minor changes to the recipe, but in a sea of metal-and-glass phones, this all-metal one still commands attention. While the OnePlus 5T adopts many of the trends we spoke of earlier, there are two in particular it's missing. For starters, it lacks any sort of water resistance, which is something that many of today's flagships offer. In addition, sticking to an all-metal design means the 5T doesn't offer wireless charging. Nevertheless, OnePlus remains to be a proponent of the headphone jack, so we're grateful that it still sees and acknowledges its purpose. Display Competing on the same playing field as many of its high-end rivals, the OnePlus 5T jumps on the 18:9 screen aspect ratio trend. In this case, OnePlus has thrown in a 6.01-inch 1080 x 2160 Full Optic AMOLED display protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5. While the OnePlus 5T certainly makes for an impression with its all-screen looks and minimal bezels around its display, screen resolution is lower than what Quad HD displays, such as the one on the Galaxy Note 8 or the LG V30, deliver. On the other hand, the pixel density of 401ppi on the OnePlus 5T is respectable and more than plenty for normal usage, unless you're a die-hard mobile VR enthusiast. Beyond resolution, this AMOLED panel runs cooler with its color temperature by default, evident in the bluish tint with the color white. However, this can be easily remedied by adjusting the calibration in the display settings. Lastly, both its viewing angles and brightness output are decent, showing little distortion at wide angles and ample visibility outdoors with the sun present. AMOLEDs typically exhibit this vibrancy, but strangely here with the OnePlus 5T, there's a dullness to the way it looks. Overall, we're not entirely blown away by the display, seeing that there are plenty more out there that command attention, but we're at least content by what it delivers. Interface and functionality The beauty of OnePlus is its budding community, where users provide feedback based on their experience. This helps shape the handset's software, named Oxygen OS, both visually and functionally. Oxygen OS refines the core Android experience without throwing in unnecessary extras. The results in a clean interface – one that doesn't stray too far from stock Android. Many of OxygenOS's features we're familiar with are still present: Reading Mode that filters out blue light, Expanded Screenshot that allows you to capture a screenshot of an entire vertical web site, a Gaming Do Not Disturb mode, and much more. With this latest version, however, they're including this useful Parallel Apps feature, which essentially clones an app so that you can run two accounts simultaneously. So far, the supported apps include things like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Skype. It's useful if you want to separate work from personal, and we hope that this feature will be extended to more apps. For the most part, OxygenOS 4.7.2 suffices in delivering tangible experience that make operating a phone simple and intuitive. But there's an asterisk next to that because it's running on top of Android 7.1.1 Nougat at the moment instead of the latest 8.0 Oreo. For some folks, this might be a deal breaker, but like most flagships around, it's only a matter of time before an update arrives. Face Unlock Another trendy feature adopted by the OnePlus 5T is this advanced facial unlocking implementation. While the fingerprint sensor is undeniably swift with its response rate, this new face recognition feature adds another layer to the mix. From the looks of it, there doesn't seem to be any additional hardware in play here, so it's left to software and algorithms that are used to identify a face through the front-facing camera. In our experience, Face Unlock worked really fast – a quick tap of the power button, with the phone being directly in front of us, is all it takes to unlock the OnePlus 5T almost instantly. And you know what? It even manages to work in the dark too! Though Face Unlock won't trigger if the phone is tilted even slightly. Its front-facing camera has to be aimed straight at the user for the feature to work. Processor and performance Just like its sibling from a few months back, the OnePlus 5T leverages the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. The base model is supported by a generous 6GB LPDDR4X RAM, while the other option boasts an even more monstrous 8GB of RAM. Is it overboard? Maybe, but it surely will turn spec-conscious individuals because of the unprecedented amounts. It's worth noting that the tallies are identical to the OnePlus 5, so while they're higher than most other phones, it's been done already. Regardless, we can attest that the OnePlus 5T runs smoothly – as you'd expect from a phone of its caliber. Even though it exhibits a response we'd classify as smooth and quick, we wouldn't go far to say that it feels snappier in performance than the Google Pixel 2 XL, the gold standard amongst Android smartphones. Nonetheless, it's no slouch either, as it attains some considerable marks in the various processing and graphics benchmarking departments. Available in either 64GB or 128GB capacities, the price difference of $60 between the two is far more comforting than what most other phones command. Camera OnePlus is no stranger when it comes to dual-camera implementations, having already established that with the OnePlus 5 from not too long ago. This time, however, they've changed one thing – the secondary camera, which is now a 20MP Sony IMX 376K sensor with an f/1.7 aperture. It's not a telephoto one like what's found with the OnePlus 5, but rather, it activates for low light shots and utilizes this Intelligent Pixel Technology that “combines” the sensor's individual pixels into groups of 4 and merges their data. The whole thing smells a lot like HTC's UltraPixel concept, the main intent being to give the 5T a boost when taking low-light shots. Meanwhile, the primary camera is still based on the same 16MP Sony IMX 398 sensor, with an aperture of f/1.7. Naturally, the dual-camera system is also there for portrait shots – wherein subjects are isolated and the background is blurred out. Before we get into the nitty-gritty about the camera's performance, we'll quickly graze through the camera interface. It's an intuitive interface that allows us to quickly switch between its modes by swiping to the left. For the most part, it's fashioned together to appease both novice users and enthusiasts – evident in the "Pro Mode" that dishes up features like a histogram, level gauge, and the ability to shoot in RAW. Image Quality Having been spoiled by the splendid performance of the Google Pixel 2 XL's camera, we'd say that the quality here with the OnePlus 5T is fine at best, but definitely not something we'd classify as class-leading. Most situations are handled well by the OnePlus 5T's camera, producing sufficient details and slightly warmer toned colors – just as long as lighting is abundant. All told, its performance mirrors to what we saw previously in the OnePlus 5. When photos are snapped under low light, they tend to exhibit a grainy tone and softer details, meaning that the secondary camera made specifically for such situations may not be as great as OnePlus wants us to believe. Using the dual-LED flash to combat those deficiencies tends to produce unwanted, unnatural colors – like the same greenish hues found with the OnePlus 5's performance. As for the front-facing camera for selfies, it's capable of producing nice shots – though, the best results are found with natural lighting. When the lighting is plentiful, details come out extremely sharp, but indoors or shots taken under artificial lighting, shots tend to become softer in tone. Portrait Mode Even with the dual-camera implementation, the OnePlus 5T's portrait shots aren’t entirely the most reliable. Not only do you have to be mindful about the distance, since it'll only work when your subject is within a certain proximity from the camera, but you also need to ensure there's enough lighting in the scene. After experiencing first-hand how the Google Pixel 2 XL is able to deliver amazing portrait shots using only a single camera, the performance here out of the OnePlus 5T's dual-camera setup isn't as convincing. Frankly, its performance is a toss-up because sometimes it nicely identifies and separates background elements from the subject. And in other times, it does a poor job of it – especially under low-light situations. Video Quality The OnePlus 5T is capable of shooting video in 720p at 30 FPS, 1080p at both 30 and 60 FPS, and 4K at 30 FPS. Equally so, we're not particularly sold by its video capturing performance either. Sure, it does nicely for most occasions, but there's some evidence of noise and graininess even with video shot under ideal conditions, not to mention the distracting jello effect introduced by the image stabilization algorithms. Speaking of which, since the OnePlus 5T lacks OIS, it instead relies on its Electronic Image Stabilization to stabilize footage. It does nicely to combat against minor shakes, but it's not effective when there's just an intense amount of movement. In particular, it exhibits this somewhat robotic movement. As for its quality, you're naturally going to achieve the best results shooting in 4K, but 1080p quality isn't bad either. Oddly enough, it seems as though that the EIS might be causing a little bit of havoc when recording video under low light. Not only are we greeted to significantly softer-toned footage, but the EIS seems to be affecting the camera's focus – resulting in this jarring appearance with videos. It's undeniably distracting, which makes us less likely to shoot with it. Multimedia The display's 18:9 screen aspect ratio makes the OnePlus 5T ideal for watching those new movies and TV shows recorded specifically in these proportions. Most YouTube videos, however, are shot in a ratio of 16 by 9, so if you choose to fill out the entire screen by pinch zooming, you'll be effectively cropping out a portion of the frame. It is also worth pointing out that the OnePlus 5T doesn't offer the same kind of HDR video support we find in other phones. When it comes to music, we have to applaud OnePlus for continuing to believe in the importance of the headphone jack. Its presence here with the OnePlus 5T offers us the convenience of connecting our favorite pair of headphones, without having to worry about carrying an adapter or dongle of some kind. If that's not enough for you, we're happy to report that the OnePlus 5T's single speaker, which is situated next to its USB Type-C port, delivers phenomenal audio filled with rich and robust tones. It's also extremely powerful with its output, easily capable of covering smaller, confined areas with its richness. Call Quality Having no major glaring issues, the OnePlus 5T gets the job done in the call quality department. The only hiccup to its performance stems with the slightly muffled toned voices heard through the earpiece. It's not terrible, but it just lacks depth and clarity. Thankfully, it's all smooth sailing for the speakerphone's performance and the other end of the line. Our callers mention having zero issues discerning our voice, even in noisy environments. Battery Life You'd think that OnePlus would include a battery of larger capacity this time around, especially being dealt with more real estate and a larger screen, but the 5T is still boasting a 3300 mAh battery cell – identical to the one in OnePlus 5 before it. Luckily, it doesn't seem like battery life is affected in a negative way, seeing that its performance is above average. Even though it doesn't break any records, we found the phone continuing to work well into a second day of normal usage. Paired with the same Dash Charge technology as before, it's mentioned by the company to achieve a mark of 58% after charging for only 30 minutes. In our testing, it managed to get through 56% in that span of time, which is still more than respectable after clocking in at 93 minutes for a full charge. Conclusion Collectively speaking, there is nothing dramatically groundbreaking about the OnePlus 5T , which, instead of introducing novelties, adopts many of the trends we observed throughout the year. Despite that, there is a singular aspect about the phone that makes it one of the most compelling devices released in 2017 – its hard-to-beat price point of $499! Considering that the majority of ultra-premium phones hover closely to the $1,000 range, the cost of the OnePlus 5T is a remarkable defiance that shouldn't go unnoticed. Seriously, it matches most of its competitors in the specs department – all the while being a fraction of the cost! That's absolutely impressive on so many levels, making the OnePlus 5T a valiant offering if you're looking for that flagship-grade, top-bang-for-the-buck smartphone, but are on a tight budget. However, as much as we're impressed by its low cost, The OnePlus 5T is not a surefire winner that can topple the greats in the high-end space right now – more so if you're willing to spend the extra money on getting a comparably spec'd smartphone without the compromises. Phones like the Google Pixel 2 XL , Samsung Galaxy Note 8 , and LG V30 will cost you a whole lot more to pick up, but they do offer a lot more in terms of features over the OnePlus 5T. If you're able to overlook some of its deficiencies, however, namely its underwhelming camera performance, lack of wireless charging and absence of water resistance, the OnePlus 5T would be an excellent choice.. 6.15 x 2.95 x 0.29 inches. 156.1 x 75 x 7.3 mm. 6.07 x 2.92 x 0.29 inches. 154.2 x 74.1 x 7.25 mm. 6.4 x 2.94 x 0.34 inches. 162.5 x 74.8 x 8.6 mm. 6.24 x 3.07 x 0.3 inches. 158.4 x 78.1 x 7.5 mm.

"That's weird" - yes it is, I think it's inaccurate. I've been round the phone shops looking at the latest models recently and was really impressed by the screen on the OnePlus 5T. It was initially set to sRGB colour profile, and still looked great. When I set it to DCI P3 it looked amazing. There's nothing wrong with the screen on this phone, it's superb. It's a surprise this review is so lukewarm - it's a fantastic phone and apart from camera quality this would be a great phone at twice the price. I own an iPhone 7 Plus so have no bias towards Oneplus.. (Posts: 260; Member since: 31 Mar 2017). posted on 27 Nov 2017, 07:44. I think the OnePlus 5T deserves a 9.5.

The OnePlus 5T is the best midrange phone out there, but it's too expensive to be an American midrange phone. This creates a quandary in the US market.. The OnePlus 5T ($499 for 64GB; $559 for 128GB) is the best phone you can get for $500, but that's slicing the phone market pretty thinly. The latest from the cult unlocked smartphone maker is beautifully built and has the processor power and RAM of phones that cost $300 more. But its modem and main camera are thoroughly midrange , landing it in an awkward zone between less-expensive and more-capable devices on the US market.. To properly understand the OnePlus 5T, you have to shake off its old "flagship killer" reputation. The 5T doesn't measure up to actual 2017 flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S8, Samsung Galaxy Note 8, or the iPhone X. Rather, this is a midrange-killer, assassinating devices like the Moto X4, the LG G6 , the Essential PH-1 , and the HTC U11 Life.. The 5T comes hot on the heels of the OnePlus 5 , in OnePlus's second year of a six-month cadence. (Last year, we saw the 3 and the 3T; there was no OnePlus 4.) It shares a processor and modem with the 5, but the screen is upgraded and the camera is changed.. From Apple, you'd consider that an "S" release. OnePlus founder Pete Lau joked that S, plus one, is T, and so here we are. Don't assume that OnePlus will have a new phone every six months, he cautioned us. This one just has a screen that he couldn't pass up.. The OnePlus 5T is very well built. It has a very slim, matte black aluminum unibody, at 6.15 by 2.95 by 0.29 inches (HWD) and 5.7 ounces. It isn't slippery, but you'll still want to put a case on it. The single speaker is on the bottom, along with the USB-C port and standard headphone jack. On the left side, you'll find OnePlus's excellent physical mute slider. The front of the phone is mostly screen.. View All 7 Photos in Gallery. The screen is why the OnePlus 5T exists. According to OnePlus execs, they saw the trend towards bigger screens and smaller bezels, so when a 6-inch, 18:9 Samsung AMOLED panel became available, they jumped at the chance to grab it. The 2160-by-1080 panel is 401ppi, which is less dense than other competing phones. They tend to be either higher-resolution, at the same size, or smaller in size, at the same resolution. The result is that icons and UX elements appear physically larger here than on a Galaxy S8 or Moto X4, although you get about the same Web browsing real estate as on the S8, because the physical size of text is the same. The one place you lose is in VR, where the OnePlus 5T isn't compatible with VR headsets, but OnePlus makes the correct point that VR isn't that frequently used nowadays.. The phone has the brightness, rich colors and wide viewing angles we associate with Samsung AMOLED, as opposed to the lower-quality LG P-OLED we've seen on the Google Pixel 2 XL. If that's too saturated for you, though, you can tune it down to DCI-P3 (like the iPhone) or sRGB (like the Pixel.) Screen images are perfectly viewable outdoors.. The phone's fingerprint scanner is on the back now, like on LG phones. That's good, because the phone's face-unlock feature does not work reliably. OnePlus says that it created a proprietary, 2D face-unlock system that is faster and more secure than Google's default face unlock. I found that it didn't work very well off-angle (on a table), or with my eyes closed, or when I was backlit, or sometimes just in general. Most of the time it worked, but it didn't work enough that (unlike with Apple's Face ID) it got on my nerves. Having the fingerprint scanner as a reliable backup was essential.. Many smaller Android brands, such as ZTE, don't have a broad set of reliable cases. That's a OnePlus strength: the company offers $19.95 screen protectors and $19.95-$29.95 cases in various styles, including silicone, carbon-fiber, and natural woods.. Unfortunately, the OnePlus 5T is not IP-rated for water resistance. I got very mixed messages on water resistance from OnePlus; I was told that it could be dropped in puddles or handled in the rain, but not dunked. We did not test water resistance because we needed the phone to remain functioning .. OnePlus, unfortunately, cut some corners with the cellular modem. The 5T supports all of AT&T's and T-Mobile's frequency bands except T-Mobile's new rural Band 71. It also supports some Sprint and Verizon LTE bands (including Sprint's band 41, but not Verizon's band 13), but those carriers won't authenticate this phone.. The phone supports 3x carrier aggregation but lacks 4x4 MIMO antennas, so it tops out at 600Mbps down. That's similar to the latest iPhones and most midrange phones, but outpaced by higher-end Android phones.. The phone takes up to two nano-SIMs, but I was disappointed to see that the second slot couldn't be used for a MicroSD card. Dual SIM phones are rare here in the states, but additional storage would have been welcome.. Call quality is good here, but voice coverage will depend on your carrier. The phone supports both Wi-Fi and VoLTE on T-Mobile. Neither option appeared with AT&T or Cricket SIMs. Using the AT&T 3G network, the earpiece was loud, and the speakerphone was sharp and clear. The speakerphone mix doesn't kill all the background noise, but my voice was nicely detected and pushed far forward of any background noise.. See How We Test Cell Phones. The 5T supports Bluetooth 5.0 and had no trouble pairing with my Plantronics Voyager Focus UC. If you play high-quality music files, though, make sure to delve into the settings and switch the codec from SBC to the higher-quality AptX HD. The single speaker isn't amazing, but at least it doesn't distort at high volumes the way the Moto X4's does.. Battery life was very good, at 7 hours, 10 minutes of LTE video streaming with the screen on full brightness. Unfortunately, that's two hours less than the OnePlus 5's runtime (9 hours, 15 minutes), likely due to the increased screen size. It'll still last longer than the S8 though (5 hours, 45 minutes). OnePlus's quick "Dash Charging" lives up to its billing, too. I got from 0 to 40% in 20 minutes, and to 79% in 45 minutes, with the phone off. If you have other phones around, be aware that OnePlus's dash charger, included with the phone, is just an ordinary non-quick charger when used with other phones, and non -OnePlus chargers won't quick-charge the phone.. The phone also doesn't have wireless charging, but honestly, after six months of using a Galaxy S8 with wireless charging, I still see it as a disposable frill. I'm okay with leaving it out on this midrange phone.. OnePlus's Oxygen OS skin over Android 7.1.1 Nougat focuses on speed and customizability. (The company says that an Android Oreo update will come during the first quarter of 2018.) Its benchmarks tend to match other Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 phones, especially if they're in 1080P resolution mode: its 169,703 score on Antutu, for instance, it very similar to the Moto Z2 Force and the Google Pixel 2, and just a bit behind the Galaxy Note 8 and LG V30 .. On-screen gaming frame rates are also on par with high-end peers at the same resolution. The Galaxy Note 8 only scores 13 fps in the GFXBench Car Crash test, compared to the OnePlus's 23 fps, but knock the Note 8 down to 1080p and it's on par.. The thing is, though, this is the least expensive Snapdragon 835 phone out there. At its price level, the OnePlus 5T is competing with the Moto X4 and HTC U11 Life , both of which manage around 70,000 on Antutu, and the LG G6, which gets 135,000. The OnePlus 5T's GPU has at least double the performance of any of those phones, which you definitely feel in action and driving games; the game Breakneck, for instance, had more sensitive controls on the OnePlus 5T than on the Moto X4. So you're getting a heck of a lot of processor for your money.. The 5T comes in two models, with 6GB and 8GB of RAM, and 64GB or 128GB of storage. That means more flipping in and out of apps without watching them restart than on other phones, which is especially relevant if you do a lot of gaming. Our 128GB test phone has 111GB free.. Oxygen OS, itself, doesn't get in your way. It looks and feels like stock Android, with a bunch of little customizations that you can use or ignore. The most useful is "parallel apps," which lets you create a second, virtual installation of some popular apps so you can have two accounts available. It works with Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook Messenger, Twitter, Skype, and Whatsapp.. OnePlus has a vibrant user community, a vigorous beta program, and an invasive data collection system telling the company what people are doing with their phones. After some controversy, the "user experience program" is still opt-in, although you can opt out in the Settings menu.. And if you don't like Oxygen OS at all, OnePlus is probably the most hacker-friendly mainstream Android brand; the company confirmed that the phone's bootloader is unlocked, and you can install whatever ROM you like.. OnePlus does some odd things with the cameras this time around. On the back of the phone, there's a main 16-megapixel, f/1.7 camera but also a 20-megapixel, f/1.7 camera that's supposed to be for low light. The front camera is an excellent 16-megapixel, f/2 selfie shooter.. The philosophy around the camera is a little perplexing. The secondary camera is supposed to kick in for scenes below 10 lux, using 4:1 pixel binning to provide a brighter, 5-megapixel image. That's totally not what it does in practice.. First of all, 10 lux is really dim. Indoor scenes are far more than 10 lux; even a darkened bowling alley, where we tested the camera, was at about 30 lux. So it can be hard to get the secondary camera to trigger in the first place, especially because you can't turn it on manually.. The secondary camera also delivers 20MP files. OnePlus says it bins the image down to 5MP and then re-expands the file to 20MP, which introduces a lot of visible artifacting. And because of software which prioritizes higher shutter speeds over viewable images, the photos can still look very dim, especially compared to the latest Galaxies or the Pixel 2 .. Here's where "what you're comparing it with" matters a lot. Against the $649 Pixel 2 and $720 Galaxy S8 the 5T has unimpressive low light performance. But the 5T crushes the $400 Moto X4 in low light. In our super-low-light test, we could make out details in the 5T's image that were swallowed up in dimness on the X4.. In good light, the main camera also falls between the Moto X4 and the Galaxy S8/Note 8. Yes, there are more pixels than on the 12-megapixel Samsung phones, but that didn't result in more sharpness and detail, just more artifacting. The software bias towards higher shutter speeds didn't necessarily help here either, as some outdoor HDR photos turned out a little darker than I'd like.. The 16-megapixel, f/2.0 front camera destroys the X4's front shooter. It delivers richer color, more realistic detail, and collects considerably more light. It takes flashless, low-light shots in darkened rooms that just get swallowed up in mud on the X4.. The dual cameras enable the usual gimmicky bokeh 'portrait mode' in its most basic form, without the after-the-fact focus editing of the Galaxy Note 8 or the iPhone's range of lighting effects. Using the second camera slot for the 'low light' camera also means you don't get wide-angle (like on the X4 and LG G6) or 2x zoom (like on the Note 8 and iPhone) options. There's a confusing '2X' button in the camera UI, but it just activates digital zoom, with all the usual digital zoom artifacting .. OnePlus's "electronic image stabilization" stays with the theme of "not as good as a flagship, but better than nothing." When recording 4K video, you can see the EIS smoothing out video through a slight pulsing as it constantly corrects the video. It's nowhere near as smooth, calm or fluid as the OIS on a Galaxy Note 8, but it's less jittery than no stabilization at all.. None of this should be too shocking; it's just reality. The OnePlus 5T has the best camera you can get in a $500 phone, but it doesn't measure up to phones that cost more.. There's an 'uncanny valley' in phone pricing in the US. We buy a lot of phones that cost less than $400, but if we're going to spend $500, pretty often we spend $700, especially if that $700 phone comes with a monthly payment plan.. The OnePlus 5T falls smack into that uncanny valley. If you're looking for a big screen at a reasonable price, there's nothing quite like it. But OnePlus's price creep has made its phones steadily less attractive compared with higher-end competitors. The OnePlus 3 cost $399; the OnePlus 5 cost $479, and now we're up to $499 and $559.. The $649 Google Pixel 2 and the $720 Samsung Galaxy S8 both have better cameras and modems (although they offer less storage and RAM), and they support all four major US carriers. If you intend to spend more than the $400 for a Moto X4, you're likely to be picking up one of those on a monthly payment plan from a carrier or major retailer. There's no payment plan for the OnePlus 5T; you have to buy it up front.. The 5T sets the bar for a $500 phone, to be sure. There's no $500 phone that performs like this. But not many Americans are looking for a $500 phone, per se. Unless the screen size here calls out to you, the superior camera and network performance on the Pixel 2 or Galaxy S8 will probably do you better.. Bottom Line: The OnePlus 5T is the best midrange phone out there, but it's too expensive to be an American midrange phone. This creates a quandary in the US market..

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. The flagship killer returns in style. While there are a few small compromises to consider - no QHD display, stereo speakers, expandable storage or standout camera - the OnePlus 5T represents some of the best value for money in the market. OnePlus 5T price and availability OnePlus 5T launch price: from £449, $499, AU$599 OnePlus 5T release date: November 21 Display Biggest-ever screen on a OnePlus phone 6.01-inch Full HD, AMOLED display with 18:9 aspect ratio Design Premium metal unibody looks and feels great Fingerprint scanner on rear with smaller bezels up front Face recognition Fast, easy and effective Not as accomplished as iPhone X. The OnePlus 5T, as the name suggests, isn't a completely new handset – rather, it's an incremental upgrade of the OnePlus 5 .. [Update: The OnePlus 5T is now available in a limited edition Red Lava finish. We've been hands on the new color variant and have added pictures and our thoughts on the finish in this review. An update to Android Oreo is also nearly ready.]. It's not just an upgrade though; it's also a replacement, as OnePlus has ceased production and sales of the phone it launched just six months prior to the arrival of the OnePlus 5T.. This isn't a surprising move, as OnePlus did exactly the same thing in 2016 when it introduced the OnePlus 3T half a year after launching the OnePlus 3 .. So what do you get with OnePlus' second generation 'T'? The main talking points include the biggest screen the firm has ever put on a phone, a tweaked design, improved rear camera and face recognition.. In short, there's enough new stuff to justify its existence without it offering a radically new smartphone experience.. Check out our video below outlining the design and screen of the OnePlus 5T. Weight : 162g Dimensions : 156.1 x 75 x 7.3mm OS : Android 7.1.1 Screen size : 6.01 inches Resolution : 1080 x 2160 CPU : Snapdragon 835 RAM : 6GB/8GB Storage : 64GB/128GB Battery : 3,300mAh Rear camera : 16MP + 20MP Front camera : 16MP. The good news is that the OnePlus 5T price is exactly the same as the OnePlus 5's, which means SIM-free you're looking at £449 ($499, AU$599) for the 6GB/64GB model, and £499 ($559, AU$699) for the 8GB/128GB variant.. This makes the OnePlus 5T cheaper than pretty much all of its flagship rivals – but significantly the difference in spec between them is the smallest it's ever been.. As far as a OnePlus 5T release date goes, the handset will be available from November 21 in North America, UK and Europe, with China, Hong Kong and India getting the phone soon after.. In the UK, OnePlus has signed an exclusive deal with O2, with the network offering the handset on a range of tariffs for those who don’t fancy buying the 5T outright. You can see the best OnePlus 5T deals O2 has to offer by clicking here .. The 6-inch full HD display on the 5T is bright and clear. The single biggest change on the OnePus 5T is the display, with the handset boasting a 6.01-inch Full HD AMOLED panel with a 18:9 aspect ratio that follows this year's trend of elongated screens on the iPhone X , Google Pixel 2 XL , Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG V30 .. It's the first time OnePlus has increased the size of the display on its core handset (the smaller OnePlus X aside), making this the biggest screen we've ever seen on a handset from the Chinese firm.. While its size and aspect ratio may see the OnePlus 5T pull inline with the flagship handsets it's looking to topple, there is still one spec which denies it full membership of the high-end display club: resolution.. OnePlus has once again opted to stick with a Full HD resolution, at 1080 x 2160 with a 401ppi pixel density, while rivals all boast QHD (2K) displays.. It doesn't mean the screen on the OnePlus 5T is poor, and thanks to the AMOLED panel colors are bright and punchy, but when you slide it alongside the competition you can see it's not as sharp. In isolation though, it’s difficult to pick any real fault with it.. OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei also revealed on Twitter that he fooled a fan into thinking it did have a QHD display, when actually it’s stuck with Full HD.. Alongside QHD rivals it doesn't look as good, but it's by no means a bad display. The default color balance does seem to be a little blue, and if that doesn't suit your eyes you can change this in the settings menu.. The screen calibration options enable you to switch to SRBG, DCI-P3, adaptive mode or customize your own settings, although the default mode does give you the punchier colors.. Selecting another mode mutes the vibrancy, but does give a more natural look to colors, especially when viewing images. The choice is yours, but we opted to stick with the default setting for the majority of our OnePlus 5T review.. OnePlus has also included a feature it calls Sunlight Display, which automatically detects harsh light and adapts the display for the best viewability; it's basically an auto brightness mode, but it also knows what you’re doing on screen (whether it's a game, movie or general navigation) and will optimize the display accordingly.. We didn't notice the OnePlus 5T adapting the screen during our review period, but we also didn't experience any viewability issues, which suggests that Sunlight Display does work, if only subtly.. The bigger display has had a knock-on effect in terms of the design of the OnePlus 5T, with the bezels above and below the screen getting slimmed down to provide a sleeker look and an 80.5% screen-to-body ratio.. That reduction in bezel has necessitated another design change too, with the fingerprint scanner and physical navigation keys disappearing from the front of the phone.. Biometric fans needn't worry though, as the digit reader has been relocated to the rear of the device, and its centralized position means it's easy to hit with your forefinger – and of course there's now face recognition too, of which more in a moment.. The OnePlus 5T continues with the premium metal unibody design of the phone it's replacing, which makes it look good and feel great in the hand, with the gently-curving rear helping it nestle nicely into the palm.. At 156.1 x 75 x 7.3mm and 162g the OnePlus 5T is wider, taller and heavier than the OnePlus 5, but remains the same thickness, making it similar in size and weight to the LG V30 and iPhone 8 Plus .. OnePlus 5T Midnight Black hands on gallery. Something the design doesn't offer, though, is much grip, so you may want to invest in a material or silicone case to give you a little extra purchase – although it will add to the phone's size in your hand.. You'll find that the power/lock key on the right, and the volume rocker on the left, fall easily under thumb and finger when you're holding the phone in portrait, and OnePlus continues with its notification slider on the side of the handset, allowing you to easily switch between silent, do not disturb and loud modes.. At launch it was available in just one color (Midnight Black), but in January 2018, OnePlus launched a new color variant of the OnePlus 5T, the limited edition Sandstone White finish.. First of all it's white (duh), but only on the back. The front of the handset remains black, as does the rear camera bump. While we would have liked a white surround on the front too, we do like the black camera bulge.. The Sandstone White OnePlus 5T uses the same black volume rocker, power switch and SIM tray, providing more contrast against the white finish. Then there's the alert slider, which is an eye-catching red.. OnePlus 5T Sandstone White hands on gallery. If this looks familiar, it's because it's exactly the same color composition OnePlus used for the Star Wars Edition of the handset (launched in just a handful of countries) minus the famous franchise's logo on the back.. What the white finish does provide is more grip, with a textured finished which more closely resembles the original OnePlus One. The trade-off is the white version doesn't feel as premium in the hand, and if the OnePlus One is anything to go by it could end up getting quite dirty relatively quickly.. The white variant sold out in a few weeks, and it was swiftly followed by the introduction of the Lava Red OnePlus 5T in February 2018. Again, it's a strictly "while stocks last" type of deal, and is only available on the more expensive 128GB model. Like the Midnight Black version, Lava Red is fully metal, meaning a slippery body front and back.. OnePlus 5T Lava Red hands on gallery. It's worth noting that OnePlus provides a clear plastic case in the box with both the Midnight Black, Sandstone White and Lava Red models, which should keep it looking smarter for longer.. Another plus point on the OnePlus 5T is that the headphone jack has also been retained, allowing you to plug in your headphones without the need for a clunky adapter.. The camera bump from the OnePlus 5 remains on the 5T, but this time around the edges of the protrusion have been more lovingly sculpted into the main body of the device for a more uniform and slick look.. OnePlus claims it has added an anti-fingerprint layer to the finish on the OnePlus 5T, but we found that it still got grubby pretty easily, although marks and prints are easy enough to wipe off.. From the back, it looks like the OnePlus 5, only with a fingerprint scanner. Another key feature, and a first for OnePlus, is the inclusion of face recognition tech as the brand attempts to ride the coattails of the iPhone X.. Face recognition on the OnePlus 5T isn't as advanced as Apple’s offering, but it's still surprisingly good, using over 100 facial identifiers to check it's you.. It's used only for unlocking the handset, and you'll need to double-tap the screen or press the power key to utilize it.. The good news is that it's really easy to setup, with the phone requiring only a matter of seconds to lock in your look.. Face unlock is surprisingly quick and easy to setup on the OnePlus 5T. It's incredibly fast, with almost no delay between you tapping the screen or button and your home screen appearing before you. OnePlus claims the tech can identify you and unlock the handset in just 0.4 seconds, and we’re inclined to agree.. This does mean it’s a touch slower than the fingerprint scanner (0.2 seconds), and it requires you to be looking almost directly at the phone for it to work.. However, we did find that face unlock worked at some impressive angles, which means you don't have to hold the OnePlus 5T directly in front of your face for it to work.. Something it can't do, but which the iPhone X can, is see you in the dark. That's because, unlike Apple, OnePlus hasn't used an infrared camera to spy you in the dark.. Face unlock on the 5T requires a light source – street lights at night are enough, but the screen brightness itself isn't – to check your face.. The OnePlus 5T can handle glasses and no glasses, so whether or not you’re wearing them the phone will know it’s still you, as long as your eyes are still visible. Where it struggles is when the eyes are covered.. The OnePlus 5T unlocked for us in the top row, but the disguises worn in the bottom row saw the 5T lock us out.. We tried face unlock in several different scenarios (as you can see above), but when we wore a low slung hat, and then blinkered goggles, the 5T wouldn’t unlock.. We also passed it around the office, friends and family to see if anyone else’s face unlocked the handset, and the good news is they didn’t. The likelihood is that the technology may be fooled on rare occasions – as it has been on the iPhone X – but it feels secure..

OnePlus 5T: Details, Specs, Problems, and Price!. This is everything you need to know about the OnePlus 5T!. OnePlus has settled into a six-month cycle for its phones: in the summer, its flagship gets a new design language and number, while in the winter that same phone gets tweaked and the letter "T" added to stand out from its predecessor. OnePlus continued this tradition in late 2017 with the OnePlus 5T replacing the OnePlus 5. This is everything you need to know about the OnePlus 5T!. We've had our hands on the OnePlus 5T since its unveiling, and we've spilled plenty of digital ink to cover it. Check out our video review above, and read our written reviews linked below:. OnePlus 5T review: Come for the value, not the excitement. OnePlus 5T India review: Hitting all the right notes. OnePlus's mantra has always been offering flagship-level internals coupled with minimalist software, all for significantly less than similarly-specced devices. The OnePlus 5T has all the right stuff you'd expect for late 2017: a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, a 6-inch, 18:9 screen, and a dual-camera. Check out the full spec sheet below!. 6-inch Optic AMOLED, 2160x1080 (18:9 aspect ratio). Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 octa-core Adreno 540 GPU. 16MP (IMX 398), 1.12-micron pixels, f/1.7 Dual LED flash, 4K 30 fps, 1080p 60 fps, 720p 120 fps video. 20MP (IMX 376k), 1-micron pixels, f/1.7. 16MP (IMX 371), 1-micron pixels, f/2.0 1080p 30 fps video. 802.11ac Wi-Fi, 2x2 MIMO, Bluetooth 5.0, aptX HD USB-C (2.0), NFC GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo. 3xCA, 256QAM, DL Cat 12, UL Cat 13 FDD-LTE Band 1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/17/18/ 19/20/25/26/28/29/30/66 TDD-LTE Band 34/38/39/40/41 TD-SCDMA Band 34/39 HSPA Band 1/2/4/5/8. 156.1 x 75 x 7.3 mm 162 g. More: OnePlus 5T: Should you pay extra for 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage?. You can unlock it with your face. LG has used a secondary lens for wide-angle shots , Huawei uses its second lens for black-and-white shots , while OnePlus is using the second lens in the 5T to better capture low-light shots. Under 10 lux, which is is where most phone cameras start to struggle. The user doesn't need to do anything to change which lens is in use; the camera software will automatically pick based on the ambient light.. Unfortunately, low-light photos from the 5T aren't particularly good. Andrew noted his photos had a good bit of grain and strange artifacts from the camera software trying to smooth things out. In fact, the main camera took better low-light shots than the secondary lens. There's no OIS in either lens, which would have gone a long way towards making those low-light shots better. The OnePlus 5T takes great shots when there's ample light, but don't count on it for your concert photos.. More: OnePlus 5T gets numerous camera improvements and December security patch. Android phones have been able to unlock with the user's face since the Ice Cream Sandwich era, but the feature was never particularly consistent or secure. OnePlus has solved the first problem with the 5T, with a face unlock system that is ridiculously fast. There aren't special camera sensors like on the Galaxy Note 8 or the iPhone X , and the face unlock on the 5T isn't as secure as it is on those phones. But it can't be fooled with a photograph, which should be secure enough for most users. Even better: OnePlus has started rolling this feature out to its older devices, back to the OnePlus 3.. More: OnePlus 5 now has Face Unlock with OxygenOS Open Beta 3. There's also a Sandstone White version. The Force is strong with OnePlus fans, at least in India. The company released a special edition of the 5T in India for ₹38,999 ($600), and it looks gorgeous. Rather than the matte black used on most 5T's, the Star Wars edition has an all-white color scheme with a sandstone finish. Accenting the white paint job are the Star Wars and OnePlus logos, Alert Slider, power button, and volume rocker all in red.. More: OnePlus 5T Star Wars Limited Edition launches in India for ₹38,999 ($600). For those of you outside India, don't fret: OnePlus now makes mostly the same device, just without the Star Wars branding. You get the same sandstone texture, the same pure white color, and the same red accents. Be careful with it though: Alex found the device got dirty after only a few days. The phone regularly picked up black and blue coloring from being in his jeans pocket. While it's not difficult to clean for now, be wary of the long-term durability of this coating. The Sandstone White OnePlus 5T is available for the same $499 that the black version is.. More: The OnePlus 5T in Sandstone White is gorgeous, and probably won't stay that way for long. One oddity ( or maybe not ) with the OnePlus 5T is that it launched with Android 7.1.1 Nougat , rather than the more recent Android 8.0 Oreo. That'll change soon, though: the company has already started fielding beta builds of Oreo through its Open Beta program, with a stable launch in the coming weeks. The OnePlus 5 began receiving its Oreo update before the update was paused, so hopefully the 5T will receive the update once OnePlus gets things figured out.. More: Oreo update cancelled for OnePlus 5 due to unnamed bug. The OnePlus 5T's main selling point is its lower price for mostly the same experience compared to the big names in the Android world, and it holds up favorably. Against the Pixel 2, you get a larger screen and battery size, similar light software experience with some genuinely useful additions to vanilla Android, and (most importantly) a headphone jack. Things look even more favorable when comparing the 5T against the Pixel 2 XL, which has the same screen size and dimensions but costs $350 more. Where the 5T is lacking is water resistance — there isn't any — and the camera. Again, the 5T has a good camera, but the Pixel 2 crushes it in low-light photography. If those are important to you, it may be worth the extra money for Google's flagship.. The 5T is also a great phone for Windows 10 Mobile converts. The lighter software will be easier to adjust to than heavier versions of Android that come from Samsung and LG, OnePlus's features don't get in your way if you live in Microsoft's ecosystem, and the lower price is also welcome..

Day-long battery life, and a headphone jack. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. OnePlus is back with the OnePlus 5T , a revised version of its excellent OnePlus 5. Much like Apple’s “S” revisions, like the iPhone 6S , OnePlus’ “T” phones largely stick with the same hardware and design as the original, with minor changes that make the phone a more attractive purchase in the latter half of the year. It’s the same approach the company took in 2016 with the OnePlus 3. and 3T , despite saying future T-versions of its smartphones weren’t certain .. The changes with the 5T make a dramatic difference to the way the phone looks. In our OnePlus 5T review, we found a smartphone that’s impossible not to recommend. It offers a brilliant, bezel-less smartphone experience at an amazing price. OnePlus proves again you don’t need to break the bank for a flagship phone.. The OnePlus 5T is the phone the OnePlus 5. The most visual change is on the front — the 5T swaps the. chunky edges around the screen, and the 16:9 aspect ratio screen for a modern 18:9 screen, with skimpy bezels at the top and bottom.. It transforms the way the OnePlus 5T looks, making it truly a peer alongside other bezel-less smartphones. like the Samsung Galaxy S8 , the Huawei Mate 10 Pro , and the LG V30. It’s taller and slimmer than the OnePlus 5’s screen, and now measures 6.01-inches rather than 5.5-inches. Despite the larger screen, the phone’s body is almost exactly the same size, though a little heavier at 163 grams. The weight is different enough to notice when you compare the two together, but not in everyday use.. The anodized aluminum body is curved at the sides and smooth to the touch. The back is comfortable and ergonomic, but the sides have a sharp edge to them, which slightly improves grip but isn’t especially pleasing to hold. It’s slippery too, forcing you to hold on tight and further emphasizing the sharp line. We wrapped it in a OnePlus case. — the new red silicone one is our favorite — which cured both problems.. The OnePlus 5T is the phone the OnePlus 5 should have been.. Minimizing the edges around the screen also meant getting rid of capacitive buttons and the home button, which doubled as a fingerprint sensor. The sensor has now relocated to the back of the phone, and you can only use on-screen navigation buttons on the 5T. OnePlus has used the outgoing format since the OnePlus 2 , and some hardcore fans may find this change controversial. Fingerprint sensors on the rear are almost standard across the Android world now, with LG, Samsung, Google, and others all adopting it. It’s natural and convenient, largely because the sensor is well-placed. It also helps that it’s beyond lightning fast.. Changing the design like this has made the OnePlus 5T look less like an iPhone, and we really adore the minimalist approach throughout. Just look at the back: A OnePlus logo, neatly blended in antenna lines, and that’s all.. It’s not all great news though. The camera lens bulge has got bigger, and it’s a shame the fingerprint sensor looks like an afterthought — we would have liked to see it a little more indented or have chamfered edges to make it a little more distinguishable.. None of these tiny issues spoil the OnePlus 5T.. All this talk about 18:9 aspect ratio screens, and the continued adoption of them by the smartphone industry, may make you wonder if they’re worth the hype. How does the OnePlus 5T’s new screen look? It’s still a gorgeous Full Optic AMOLED panel, just like the one of the OnePlus 5 , only with a slightly adjusted Full HD+ resolution, reaching 2,160 x 1,080 pixels spread over the 6.01-inch panel. It’s crisp, has a beautiful color spread with deep blacks, and its high brightness level makes it easy to read in direct sunlight. The OnePlus 5T’s screen really is wonderful.. What’s the difference between looking at a OnePlus 5 (or any other 16:9 aspect ratio screen) and the OnePlus 5T? Let’s take a Twitter feed as an example. On the OnePlus 5T’s screen you see almost an entire tweet more than on the OnePlus 5. The same effect will be seen in most social networking apps, browsing the web, and in other text-based activities in portrait orientation.. In landscape mode, you can pinch out to expand YouTube videos so they take up the whole screen. It crops the image, so videos look cut off sometimes. Does this make it pointless? No. Some Netflix content is made in 18:9 and will fill the screen now, with more to come in the future. Selected games also stretch across the landscape screen, look great, and provide a genuinely more immersive experience.. The OnePlus 5T’s screen really is wonderful to look at.. We hesitate to call the 18:9 aspect ratio screen larger or better than its 16:9 counterpart; but it certainly shows more content in the right situation, which means less scrolling and more reading. We didn’t notice any difference in performance between the AMOLED on the OnePlus 5 and the OnePlus 5T. Viewing angles are excellent, and you can hide the Android navigation keys away from sight to make the most of the edge-to-edge screen.. In addition to a Reading Mode, where color temperature is altered and the screen calibrated based on ambient light to improve reading conditions, OnePlus added Sunlight Display to its adaptive brightness mode. OnePlus said this “changes the contrast of the display to automatically reduce glare in situations where it’s needed,” such as outdoors on a bright day. It kicks in when it’s needed, but is it effective? We have no complaints regarding the screen’s visibility outdoors, so we assume the silent feature is doing its job effectively.. OnePlus has retained the dual-lens, 16-megapixel and 20-megapixel cameras from the OnePlus 5 on the T model, but has made some changes to the lenses. Gone is the telephoto lens and in comes a standard lens with an f/1.7 aperture. The intention is to improve low-light performance. Without a telephoto lens, there’s no optical zoom — though you can still quickly jump to 2x digital zoom — and Portrait Mode photos aren’t as close up.. How does Portrait Mode work without the telephoto lens? OnePlus told Digital Trends “the sensors work like your eyes: One is optimized to bring the subject matter to the forefront and one is able to achieve the background blur. You do not need a telephoto lens to achieve bokeh-effect images.”. So how do they look? Results vary, just like all artificial bokeh modes on smartphones. What the OnePlus 5T does well is pick out edges, whether it’s an object or someone’s face, and the shots aren’t cropped down to achieve the portrait effect.. It reminded us more of the Galaxy Note 8’s camera. than the iPhone or the OnePlus 5. The low-light performance of the OnePlus 5T’s camera when using Portrait Mode is better than the 5, with less grain and more detail. Taking shots at night outside didn’t reveal the OnePlus 5T to be overly adept at handling poor lighting, despite both lenses having an f/1.7 aperture, and it certainly can’t match the Huawei Mate 10 Pro. The camera is relatively feature-sparse and has a Pro mode, a panorama mode, plus a time-lapse and slow motion video mode.. The camera app is dead simple to use: Swipe left or right on the viewfinder screen to access video or Portrait Mode. A recent OxygenOS update has changed the user interface slightly, adding text below the viewfinder to show which mode you’re using, plus it has refined the options menu that’s now accessed with a swipe up on the screen. It hasn’t changed the way some of the less often-used features, like the grid, are altered. They’re still hidden under a settings mode at the top right of the menu screen.. One new feature we did like works with the rear fingerprint sensor — you can long press the sensor to take a photo. This works with both rear and selfie cameras, and it’s handy. The 16-megapixel selfie cam doesn’t have a portrait mode, but takes good pictures. Its only feature is a simple beauty mode. A software update says it includes “improvements for photo quality,” but we have yet to notice any major differences.. The OnePlus 5T’s camera is very good, but it’s not spectacular. It’s missing some of the excitement we feel when using the Huawei Mate 10 Pro, the LG V30, or the Google Pixel 2. Regardless, we’re confident the OnePlus 5T will do everything we ask without fuss, and we’ll be happy with the end results.. Knowing it may face some backlash to for moving the fingerprint sensor to the rear, OnePlus has added another way to unlock the phone on the front. Face Unlock works with the selfie camera to identify and unlock your face, and it works exceptionally well. Glance at a locked screen and the phone quickly springs to life. It’s incredibly fast, and in our experience beats the iPhone X. and the Galaxy Note 8. Face Unlock works with the selfie camera, and it works exceptionally well.. How has OnePlus managed such a feat? It’s not used for security, so the requirements aren’t as stringent as they are on the iPhone or the Note 8. OnePlus said it’s for convenience, and to emphasize this, you can’t use Face Unlock with Android Pay or with any secure app.. It works superbly, and it is indeed convenient. If you’re worried about it not being secure, you can turn it off, and stick with the fingerprint sensor. In its Oxygen OS 4.7.4 update, OnePlus optimized the system even more, but as it worked consistently for us before, it hasn’t changed the experience.. OnePlus has left the internal specifications alone for the 5T, keeping the Snapdragon 835 processor and offering a choice of 6GB of RAM with 64GB of storage space, and 8GB of RAM with 128GB of storage space. Don’t be fooled into thinking 8GB of RAM makes the OnePlus 5T perform differently. We tried both OnePlus 5 models and couldn’t tell the difference, and we expect it’s the same with the OnePlus 5T. It’s worth paying extra for the 128GB of storage space if you download a lot of media, as the 5T doesn’t offer a MicroSD card slot.. Running some benchmarks, we got the following results:. The OnePlus 5’s AnTuTu score (181,599) was marginally higher than the OnePlus 5T, which makes sense because the same processor is powering a slightly larger, and higher-resolution screen. But the OnePlus 5T still beats out some of the other competition — the Samsung Galaxy S8, for example, scored 155,253 on AnTuTu, and 2,052 on 3DMark.. The software experience is the same as the OnePlus 5. Android 7.1.1 is installed, disguised as OnePlus’s OxygenOS, and it’s relatively close to standard Android with a few simple changes. What’s frustrating is it’s not Android 8.0 Oreo underneath. Yes, OnePlus said it’s coming in the first quarter of 2018, but for a company that told us its software department was working harder to bring out more timely updates, we’re disappointed not to see the latest version on a brand-new phone.. This means you miss out on Notification Dots on app icons, picture-in-picture mode, and a few other great new features in Android 8.0 Oreo , along with the latest security and performance enhancements. None of this means OxygenOS is slow or annoying. It’s hands down one of the better Android user interfaces out there, due to its similarity to untouched Android. We like the pull-up app drawer, the notification shade’s simplicity, and the various gestures including a double tap to wake screen. There are so many things you can customize to your liking, allowing you to make your phone look exactly how you want.. Turn on the ambient display and messages pop up on the black sleep screen in a subtle, and really stylish way. It’s eye-catching when the phone is on a desk, but the notifications don’t stay around for too long, avoiding prying eyes.. It’s a 3,300mAh battery inside the OnePlus 5T, and it’s charged using the proprietary Dash Charge system, which zips it to 60 percent in 30 minutes, and to a full charge in less than 90 minutes. It’s consistently reliable, and a genuinely helpful feature. The 60 percent is supposed to last a full day — hence the company’s “A day’s worth of power in half an hour” tagline — and in our experience this is accurate. If you don’t have the chance to give the battery a boost, a full charge has typically lasted us a day and a half. Turn the phone off overnight, and this will mean two working days should be achievable.. Rejoice, for the OnePlus 5T still has a headphone jack, despite the thinner screen bezels. It’s still a great experience for those using a wireless set up, thanks to Bluetooth 5 and support for AptX HD. While the AptX HD performance can’t quite match LG’s phones, wired headphones sound excellent, especially when using the built-in presets and tuning. OnePlus hides this away in the general settings, because it doesn’t have its own music app.. How much extra is OnePlus charging for the OnePlus 5T, over the now discontinued OnePlus 5? The very good news is it isn’t much at all. the phone is $500 for the 64GB model, and $560 for the 128GB. It’s sold through the OnePlus website. The 64GB version is 450 British pounds in the U.K., and the 128GB is 500 British pounds. OnePlus also continues its relationship with the O2 network , where it will be sold with a various contract options.. There are at least two special edition OnePlus 5T phones available too. In China, you can buy a lava red version of the phone, while in India, there’s a Star Wars branded OnePlus 5T available. It has a Star Wars logo on the back, and a selection of custom wallpapers and themes installed. Currently, neither of these are sold outside their respective countries.. OnePlus has a one-year warranty on its devices in the U.S., and two-years in the U.K. Phones with any manufacturing defects will be repaired or replaced free of charge, with shipping and handling costs included. Unless you mistreat the device, or it gets damaged through daily wear and tear, when it won’t be covered. Alternatively, OnePlus offers an extended warranty plan though Assurant Solutions called On-Guard. You can pay for a year, 18 months, or two years. The advantage is claims are dealt with in the U.S, so things should move quicker. Prices range between $20 and $110 extra.. OnePlus continues to make it difficult to justify spending more on a smartphone. The OnePlus 5T is really all you need.. We’ve talked about the specs already, so it’s clear the OnePlus 5T can take on more expensive hyper phones like the Galaxy S8, LG V30, and the iPhone 8. in terms of power and ability. Its feature list isn’t as extensive, but we don’t really consider this to be a negative aspect. OnePlus wants to play with the big boys, except it’s not charging big-boy prices.. The 380 British pound Honor 9 , which is only available in the U.K. , comes close with its stunning design and its strong processor and camera, as does the larger 480 British pound Honor 8 Pro. Honor has also released the Honor 7X , which while not as technically impressive as the OnePlus 5T, is considerably less expensive — just $200 in the United States — and is a phone worth considering if you’re already stretching your budget. Additionally, the Honor View 10 will directly compete with the OnePlus 5T when it’s released in January 2018.. Otherwise, you’ll have to dig a little deeper to get a comparable phone. We’d recommend the Google Pixel 2 , or Google Pixel 2 XL. The camera is better, you get regular software updates, a water-resistant phone, and a similar joy of using stock Android. The Pixel 2 XL’s the only one of the two that can take on the OnePlus 5’s style though, and it’s $750. Beginning to see just what great value the OnePlus 5T really is? There’s also the Essential Phone , which costs the same $500, but it’s major downside is the camera isn’t as good.. One advantage most other flagship smartphones have over the OnePlus is water-resistance — you’ll find none on the 5T. If you get the OnePlus 5T wet, you run the risk of it not working again. It’s not a tough body either, although because it’s metal it won’t be fragile in the same way as an iPhone 8 or Galaxy S8.. Software updates are also another concern. Android 8.0 Oreo is coming, but what comes after that is another matter. OnePlus’s track record here isn’t the best. The only way to guarantee timely software updates is to buy a Google Pixel 2. or Pixel 2 XL .. All this said, the phone is internally up to date, and the phone’s style will keep it looking fresh for a good few years. You’ll get two years strong use out of the OnePlus 5T before you even need to consider changing it for a more modern device, and even then you’ll have to be very keen to do so.. In a year where at least one smartphone has topped $1,000, the $500 OnePlus 5T is astonishingly good value given the hardware specification and style. OnePlus has ignored the temptation to add in many extra features, keeping the phone simple, accessible, and laser-focused. Buy one, and you’ll smugly chuckle at others who feel the need to spend more on a smartphone this year..

OnePlus 5T review: it’s all about that screen The OnePlus 5T is a wonderful update to an already premium affordable handset. by Joshua Vergara David Imel November 27, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Dash charging is still the fastest on the market. OxygenOS is a breath of fresh air. The OnePlus 5T is a wonderful update to an already premium affordable handset. Though the only obvious updates are a bigger screen, re-positioned fingerprint reader and different camera, the software improvements and overall experience make this one of the best phones you can buy in its price range.. Processor 2.45 GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, 10nm. Main sensor: 16 MP Sony IMX 398 sensor, 1.12 Âµm, f/1.7 aperture, 27.22 mm focal length. Secondary sensor: 20 MP IMX 376K sensor, 1.0 Âµm, f/1.7 aperture, 27.22 mm focal length. Front camera: 16 MP Sony IMX 371 sensor, 1.0 Âµm, f/2.0 aperture. Supports up to DL CAT 12 (600 Mbps) /. UL CAT 13 (150 Mbps) depending on carrier support. Connectivity Wi-Fi: MIMO 2x2, 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, 2.4/5 GHz. Bluetooth 5.0, supports aptX & aptX HD. Dimensions and weight 156.1 x 75 x 7.3 mm. With the OnePlus 3T , we got virtually the same body as the OnePlus 3 , but packed with a new processor, more RAM, and a bigger battery. This year though, there isn’t a new processor available from Qualcomm yet, and the 6-8 GB of RAM offered in the OnePlus 5 was already the highest the industry had ever seen. So many naturally wondered what OnePlus would do this time to entice customers to buy a new device just five months after the previous one. This time around, it’s all about the display.. Right out of the box, the OnePlus 5T just screams premium.. Right out of the box, the OnePlus 5T just screams premium. OnePlus knows how to make a statement and the company has gone all out on packaging design. Pulling off the lid we find the full-screened device up front, with the iconic red and white Dash Charger and cable nestled underneath.. There aren’t any additional dongles, cables or earbuds included, but the inclusion of a headphone jack is a more than welcome trade-off. While most companies seem to be moving away from the headphone jack in favor of USB Type-C and Bluetooth audio, OnePlus sticks to the basics to give consumers what they actually want. While it might be nice to offer a USB Type-A to USB Type-C adapter for data transfer as Google does, it’s not the end of the world since account-based backups have become so good.. Turning to design, the OnePlus 5T is essentially the same as its predecessor, but still recognizably new. The new 6-inch screen occupies a much larger amount of the front of the device, which is a welcome change for 2017. Because of this, the fingerprint reader has now been moved to the back. This will almost certainly be a controversial move, but it was necessary in order to maintain the form factor OnePlus wanted to utilize.. Even though OnePlus is packing a huge display in a body that isn’t much larger than the display itself, the device doesn’t feel too big. Everything in Oxygen OS scales nicely to the new 18:9 aspect ratio, and you probably wouldn’t notice a difference in content unless you booted up a video and saw the option to expand it to cover the whole display.. The camera bump is now slightly more pronounced, since the company no longer had room to fit all the components behind the top bezel. While this change is definitely noticeable, it isn’t a deterrent by any means, and the edges are now rounded as opposed to the sharper angles housing the OnePlus 5 camera.. While the rest of the specs might make you think this camera is exactly the same as before, it’s actually one of the major changes in this iteration. OnePlus has replaced the 1.6x optical telephoto lens with a 1x 20 MP shooter that uses groups of four pixels to capture more light and apparently do better in low light circumstances.. Besides these changes, the body is almost exactly the same. It uses the same aluminum alloy shell and has the same antenna lines as the 5, but the body is just a tiny bit bigger. You’ve still got the same tactile power button and volume rockers, and the hardware-based notification switch returns with the same satisfying clicky feel.. If you haven’t held a OnePlus 5 or OnePlus 5T before, I really suggest you do. While most affordable phones settle for plastic housings and cheap materials, the OnePlus 5T feels every bit if not more premium than other flagships on the market. The 5T retains the ultra-slim and polished chassis of the OnePlus 5 as well as the 3,300 mAh battery that fared well in the OnePlus 5.. OnePlus 5T vs OnePlus 5: Worth the upgrade?. The new OnePlus 5T builds upon the original OnePlus 5 with a new screen, a new camera, and updated software. But is it enough to justify an upgrade, especially for those who already have the â¦. We wanted to give a special mention to OnePlus’ dedication to first party accessories – we were lucky enough to have a number of cases included with the phone and each one has a high quality feel while adding a bit of texture to the phone’s smooth metal housing. One particularly flashy red silicone cover makes the phone really stand out, but our unit has been clad in the Sandstone case that serves as a bit of a throwback to OnePlus’ previous, arguably more unique, smartphone designs.. As I mentioned earlier, the specs are the same as the OnePlus 5 from earlier this year, because Qualcomm still has not announced their new flagship mobile processor. Nevertheless, the Snapdragon 835 and 6-8 GB of RAM tear through just about anything you can throw at them.. ..the Snapdragon 835 and 6 GB of RAM tear through just about anything you can throw at the OnePlus 5T. It did seem a bit curious that OnePlus would release a new phone just to update the aspect ratio of the screen, but for many people on the fence about purchasing a OnePlus 5 this might just be the tipping point they needed.. The biggest selling point of this device over the OnePlus 5 is obviously the display, so it only seems fair that we cover that in a bit more detail.. The OnePlus 5T is using a 6″ 1080p Optic AMOLED panel from Samsung with a Diamond Pentile arrangement, and I have had very few problems with it. The lowest brightness setting gets down to just 2.1 nits, which is dark enough that I can’t see it at all outside, but I’m happy the setting exists since I love to read in bed at night.. Display specs: the good, the bad, and the completely irrelevant. I don't mean which screen has the biggest brightness or contrast numbers, or which is the latest and greatest technology; I want to talk about the specifications themselves. You don’t have to worry about using the OnePlus 5T outside either, since this is one of the most contrasty displays on the market. The maximum brightness caps out at around 440 nits, which is pretty average, but the sunlight contrast ratio is where it really shines, only being beat out by the iPhone X in lab testing done by GSM Arena .. Some features of the display will be familiar, while others have been updated to align with the updated OxygenOS look. For example, the 5T’s version of an Ambient Display is really easy on the eyes and brings up an elegant readout of any notification that comes through. The one gripe that could be leveled against this feature is that it wasn’t converted into an Always on Display, a la Samsung – after all, this is an AMOLED screen.. Another feature that has been a favorite is the Reading Mode, returning once again from the OnePlus 5. It makes the display black and white, but with a color temperature that makes for comfortable reading of websites, apps, and even e-books. It’s the best companion for the Amazon Kindle application, allowing me to leave my actual Kindle behind once in a while.. I'll happily take the ultra-competitive price and battery life over higher resolution.. I’m honestly really pleased with this display. You might say that OnePlus should have included a 2K display since the technology is now pretty standard in flagships, but I’ll happily take the ultra-competitive price and battery life over the higher resolution. You probably shouldn’t do mobile VR on this thing, but for people not incredibly interested in that, this display works just beautifully.. If you’re not satisfied with the display in it’s default state, OnePlus gives users a variety of options to tune it to your liking. You can use the sRGB mode to get a more color-accurate experience, or use the color temperature sliders to find a warmth that works for you. It’s this kind of customization that makes us love OnePlus devices, along with the ultra-customizable but still very simplistic Oxygen OS.. In case you’re in need of a reminder, the OnePlus 5T is packing a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, 6/8 GB of RAM, and 64/128 GB of storage. These are still top of the line components, even six months after the release of the OnePlus 5, so you’re not missing out on the cutting edge this time around either. Naturally, the OnePlus 5T is incredibly snappy for a phone in this price range, and is possibly the best bang-for-your-buck available.. I never saw any slowdowns on this phone in my two weeks using it, which is really a sight to behold. Apps launch lightning fast, and multitasking is a dream. This is probably due to the lightweight nature of Oxygen OS, abundant RAM and the Snapdragon 835, but OnePlus is likely defaulting to a faster animation speed as well. I couldn’t find any settings allowing me to change the animation speed, but they feel about twice as fast as something like the Pixel 2.. There aren't many better spec'd phones on the market right now. There aren’t many better spec’d phones on the market right now, save something like the Razer Phone which has the same 8 GB of RAM as the $559 5T, a 1440p display, and a bigger 4,000 mAh battery. Still, at almost $150 cheaper it is hard to compare these devices head to head. If you want raw power you’re not going to find something better in the Android space unless you wait a few months for the next Qualcomm-powered devices to arrive.. As mentioned before, the headphone jack is still a thing in the OnePlus ecosystem, which most users will be happy to hear – using headphones on this device is a good but standard affair. One bright spot is the built-in speaker, which gets pleasantly loud without overdoing it in any one aspect. There’s no official IP certification, so just be careful if using the 5T to play music near the pool or sink. Nonetheless, this phone did a better job than most, providing loud audio that was still clear enough.. One aspect of this device we were especially concerned about is battery life. The 5T uses the same 3,300 mAh battery as the OnePlus 5, and we were worried the larger display would use more juice. Thankfully, our results have turned out pretty great, resulting in about five and a half hours of screen-on time on average. Josh, in particular, was able to get a few days of 7.5 hours SoT, which is a bit rare for a constant user like him.. While this isn’t ground-breaking power efficiency by any means, it is quite a satisfying result for a screen this large, especially with no change in battery capacity. Sticking with 1080p definitely helped in this case, and the quality of this AMOLED display is good enough that I wasn’t left longing for higher resolution either. This just goes to show that you don’t have to have all the most cutting-edge features to make a great device.. For the OnePlus 5T, OnePlus removed the telephoto 1.6x secondary camera in favor of a 20 MP 1x camera that uses groups of four pixels to perform better in low light. They’ve retained the quick-jump 2x zoom button from the OnePlus 5, though this time it is all being handled via software as opposed to the mix of optical and software-assisted zoom in the OnePlus 5. This change is a trade-off you’re seriously going to have to consider for yourself, since low light performance vs optical zoom is a very personal preference.. affects a couple of the modes too, primarily portrait mode. Background bokeh is still possible on the OnePlus 5T and we found that there was plenty more behind the subject when compared to similar modes in the original OnePlus 5 and the Pixel 2. The front facing camera has also changed, resulting in a tighter frame that required us to really reach out with the phone to put more into the frame while taking selfies or live streaming.. Without using portrait mode, hitting the 2X button on the OnePlus 5T still zooms into the frame, but the image is obviously a crop of the original sensor. We didn’t notice too much of a difference in quality between the actual zoom lens on the OnePlus 5 and the digitally achieved zoom of the 5T. If you go looking for it though, 5T photos have some obvious post-processing compared to the sharper optically zoomed images taken with the original OnePlus 5.. Despite a dedicated low light camera, the 5T left quite a bit to be desired in ultra low-light circumstances. We tested this new camera in quite a variety of low light situations, and while it is certainly decent for what it is, it often gets trounced by the algorithmic processing of phones like the Google Pixel 2. However, the new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL cost substantially more than the OnePlus 5T.. The 5T left quite a bit to be desired in ultra low-light circumstances, though it did quite well in regular light. It seems that the secondary lens only activates and backs up the main shooter in only the darkest of situations, which most users with even a little bit of photography knowledge would probably avoid in the first place. Ultimately, the promises of the 20 MP backup camera are technically sound, but prove to be largely unrealized, which is a shame because the camera does pretty well in other situations.. Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL review (Updated: addressing some issues). This review is brought to you by MNML Case, an ultra-thin case that showcases the beauty of your new phone and fits like a glove! Get 15% OFF your Google Pixel 2 case or. One such situation is 4K video recording, which has been given EIS for better stabilized footage. The video itself is pretty clear and the shakiness has improved from the previous generation camera, so we can call that a win in the camera column. One thing we did notice was pretty good quality audio capture, so if you are a vlogger or one who enjoys doing Facebook or Instagram live streams, your voice will sound loud and adequately clear to your audience.. Based on the high expectations even OnePlus themselves puts forward, I’m honestly a bit disappointed in the quality of the OnePlus 5T camera. In our testing the quality proves just a bit sub-par across the board, and I really didn’t see a substantial difference in low light capabilities. I personally would have preferred the company kept the telephoto lens for clearer zoom, but some may have a different opinion on this subject. It will be interesting to see if OnePlus keeps this setup for the OnePlus 6 or tries something else.. The UI remains quite similar to the OnePlus 5, with a few changes that help set it apart. It’s still running Oxygen OS based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat , but there will be an 8.0 Oreo beta out by the end of 2017, with an official release coming in Q1 of 2018.. I’m quite fond of Oxygen OS, as it takes many of the features of stock Android and adds some extra settings and features which help to enhance the experience. OnePlus’ software has evolved quite admirably since the OnePlus One, and it is currently one of my favorite Android skins to date. The only “bloatware” present on the device out of the box is the OnePlus Community app, but it can be uninstalled if you want to get a truly bloat-free experience.. There are a couple of new features worth discussing. Face Unlock allows you to unlock your device just by looking at it, and it works much faster than many of the other devices we’ve tested. While the feature worked a majority of the time, there were instances in which the camera did not recognize me for some unknown reason. A software update released between our initial review and now seems to have largely addressed the issue.. I’m still a bit worried about the security of Face Unlock, but I did test it against multiple photos of myself and it didn’t unlock with those, so I’m remaining hopeful for now. The fingerprint reader on the rear is also extremely fast if you would rather use that (OnePlus says it unlocks within one fifth of a second), so you’ve got quite a selection of different security options available to you. And a final note on security – Face Unlock is mainly used for unlocking the device whereas OxygenOS will often default to more secure options when necessary (eg registering security features in apps).. While Parallel Apps are useful for those that run personal and public accounts on apps like Instagram and Snapchat, most users won't find it exceptionally helpful.. A new feature which has made its way to the 5T is Parallel Apps. This feature essentially creates cloned instances of apps that require a login, allowing you to be signed in to multiple accounts at once. While Parallel Apps are useful for those that run personal and public accounts on apps like Instagram and Snapchat, most users won’t find it exceptionally helpful. Still, having the option is much better that omitting it.. One other change made to the software is an updated reading and gaming mode. While we saw these features in the OnePlus 5, the company has expanded upon them to apply different levels of contrast to help enhance the experience. The addition of adjustable contrast levels for text against the background are definitely appreciated.. How to use Reading Mode and Night Mode on the OnePlus 5. OnePlus's OxygenOS takes a lot of the best parts of stock Android and iterates on it to include a number of useful additions. One of these additions is the ability to use both Reading Mode â¦. What really stands out about OxygenOS is that it doesn’t try too hard. For the most part, using this interface yields an experience not far from stock vanilla Android; however, OnePlus has added in just enough to make the experience feel fresh. The Shelf is still a good place to stash some widgets so that they are not covering up any glorious background you may be using. These backgrounds can be drawn from a gallery of photos actually taken on OnePlus phones.. Customizing the look of the interface isn’t quite as robust as options found in third party launchers, for example, but they are equally as subtle as they are powerful. Dark and light modes can completely change the way you look at OxygenOS, while accent color options show that OnePlus pays attention to the small details that can give users a personalized experience. And for any users that need further convenience and accessibility, the gestures setting helps get users there fast from standby and the softbar can be customized to trigger functions or applications based on double taps or long. There is no over-abundance of features or many redundancies to OxygenOS – and for an interface that has come of age fairly quickly in the last couple of generations, we find Oxygen to be just that: a welcome breath of fresh air.. Overall, the 5T is a healthy addition to the OnePlus family. It takes what we already loved about the OnePlus 5 and refines the design and software a bit, while maintaining a similar sub-$500 price point. The 6-inch 18:9 display really does make for a richer experience, and for those looking to get a premium Android device on a budget, the 5T may just be the phone to beat, even if its new camera promise doesn’t quite pan out..

OnePlus 5T review: Come for the value, not the excitement. This company never stops moving, and that means we get a fresh look at the latest hardware twice a year.. OnePlus isn't interested in holding back on specs, features or capabilities to make a big reveal of a new phone just once a year. The scrappy company has settled in on a refresh cycle every six months, with a big release followed by a mid-cycle bump to bring in the latest things it's been working on. The OnePlus 5T isn't meant to be an innovative leap of technology that blows your socks off — and honestly, none of its predecessors have been particularly groundbreaking, either.. Nope, the 5T is still about value, simplicity and being tuned for what the Android enthusiast crowd craves from its phones. At $479 there wasn't much about the OnePlus 5 you could find a flaw with. Now six months later with a bigger screen, new secondary camera, neat Face Unlock feature and a $20 price bump, it's a pretty easy equation to figure out.. But while the OnePlus 5T hasn't changed much from its six-month-old predecessor, the rest of the phone market has continued to evolve. Here's how well the OnePlus 5T holds its ground against an ever-changing Android market in price brackets both above and below.. I'm writing this review after one week with the OnePlus 5T. It's a Midnight Black model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, being used on the T-Mobile network both in New York, NY and Seattle, WA. After an initial software update to version 43_171110 it was not updated over the course of the review. The phone was provided to Android Central for review by OnePlus.. Seeing a phone in action is a great way to get a feeling for it as a complete product. For an overview of the OnePlus 5T, be sure to watch our full video review above. After the video, read on for our full take with all of the details!. OnePlus 5T Hardware, display and specs. The best way to describe OnePlus hardware design is "generic, with a little extra." There's nothing particularly wonderful, awe-inspiring, attention-grabbing or special about the OnePlus 5T, but the execution of the design is oh-so-good.. There's nothing awe-inspiring about this hardware, but the materials and execution are excellent.. The slab-like bar of aluminum is pieced together with fantastic tolerance levels, and everything set into the body — buttons, switches, speakers, ports, glass — comes together exactly as you want. This may not be expensive fine-tuned design, but it sure is painstakingly great build quality. The new taller display, smaller bezels and rear-mounted fingerprint sensor just feel a bit more modern as well, befitting a late-2017 phone — even if the one casualty of the move is the removal of capacitive buttons below the screen.. The only complaint to be had here is just how slippery the body is, which is just a little worse than the OnePlus 5 because it's slightly taller and heavier. It's flat across the back with very little texture in the metal, and the edge of the transition to the flat sides isn't stark enough to get your fingers on. Thankfully OnePlus makes a handful of great thin cases for the 5T, but running this thing naked can be an unsettling experience — it reminds me very much of using an iPhone 6 or 7.. A few corners are cut to hit $499, but none of them are major — plus, you keep a headphone jack.. I still love the physical Alert Slider switch to toggle between three different notification modes, despite the fact that I've come to terms with using the software DND modes on my Google Pixel 2. I also like having the 3.5 mm headphone jack, even as I use Bluetooth headphones more and more every month. OnePlus still isn't willing to pony up the cost of adding a proper water resistance rating to the 5T, which is very unfortunate as we see other cheaper phones, like the Moto X4 , include the feature. The same sort of disappointment surrounds the speaker, which is a single down-firing unit that just doesn't sound great compared to what you get on true flagship phones. It's these sort of fringe shortcomings that remind you that cost had to be shaved somewhere to get this thing down to $499 retail.. At the same time, OnePlus continues to overdeliver in the spec sheet. A Snapdragon 835 in a sub-$700 phone is still great, and the default configuration of 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage is plenty for now and into the future. Nobody needs to spend the extra $60 to get 8GB of RAM (the highest average RAM usage I saw was 5.1GB), but the extra money is worth it for some people just for the bump to 128GB of storage considering the lack of SD card slot. Then again, with the expedience of the upgrade cycle of the typical OnePlus buyer, maybe you're fine with 64GB considering you plan on moving to a new model in six or 12 months.. This is a display that outperforms the price point.. That processor and RAM becomes even more powerful when you consider that the OnePlus 5T is only pushing a 1080p display. Though the 6-inch 2:1 aspect ratio (2160x1080 resolution) screen is a different size and shape, it looks near-identical to the 5.5-incher on the OnePlus 5. This is still an "Optic AMOLED" screen, which is made by Samsung, and OnePlus isn't really making any claims of improvement over the predecessor. That's totally fine with me, particularly at a sub-$500 price point. This display is crisp, colorful and has pretty minimal off-axis color shifting. While it's not up to the level of the displays in the Galaxy S8+ and Note 8 , it wouldn't look out of place on any $700+ phone.. The one thing I find it's missing is visibility in direct sunlight, where it lacks the high-contrast mode that kicks in on some other phones for a short period. I also find it reluctant to ramp up the brightness above about 25% when indoors, even when there's enough ambient light to warrant more from the display. On the other end of the spectrum the display does impress me with how dim it gets in dark rooms — when I move that brightness slider all the way down, it's very comfortable for my eyes at night (especially when paired with Night Mode).. OnePlus 5T Software, battery life and cameras. This section, where we typically dive deep into the quality of the software and the performance of the phone, is going to be a short one. That's because as we know the OnePlus 5T is identical internally to the OnePlus 5, and the Android 7.1.2 Nougat software has changed only marginally from its predecessor as well.. So in the name of brevity, please allow me to pull a quote from my OnePlus 5 review:. Instead of changing the basic interface paradigm of Android, OnePlus continues to add value by giving you customization options and just a handful of neat features. Offering simple things like themes, a customizable status bar, new gestures and a couple tweaks throughout the interface all enhance the experience without taking away from Google's vision of Android in any way. Most importantly, you can ignore them entirely and just use the phone as it comes out of the box, too.. OnePlus 5 review: Keep doing what you do best. OxygenOS is one of my favorite manufacturer "customizations" of Android — and I put that in quotes because OnePlus hasn't exactly added as much as it's just tweaked things. There are just some visual, transition and color changes throughout the system, plus a few nice features like Reading Mode, and then some typically unseen customization options throughout the interface. I'm not in love with its choice to go with a primarily white status bar, and its ambient lock screen needs some work, but the most important part about OxygenOS is I can't find anything that's annoying or in my way — that definitely isn't the case on every phone I've used this year.. Exactly as was the case with the OnePlus 3T in 2016, this review comes out in the shadow of a big impending software update. We know OnePlus [already has an Android 8.0 Oreo build for OnePlus 3 and 3T owners , and that beta program will open up to the 5 and 5T by the end of 2017. Unfortunately, that means we're still looking at "early 2018" for a stable Oreo release. And while it'll certainly be released ahead of most manufacturers, OnePlus definitely won't be the first with Oreo and it's a bit disappointing as other companies like Sony, HTC , Samsung and Essential either have phones already with Oreo or in open beta testing.. This isn't Face ID, and it sure isn't high security, but damn it works well.. The only exciting software addition on the OnePlus 5T is Face Unlock. Unlike more advanced versions of this feature, Face Unlock on the 5T simply uses a little software and the regular 16MP front-facing camera (the same unit as the OnePlus 5). After a quick scan of your face, the software identifies 100 data points that make your face unique and each time the screen turns on it attempts to match those up with whoever is holding the phone. This is absolutely the fastest implementation of a front-facing camera-based unlocking method, easily beating what Samsung and Google have on their latest phones. It unlocks the phone before you have a chance to think about unlocking the phone — it's great. Even with the fingerprint sensor being in a very comfortable place to reach, Face Unlock is so fast it can easily open your phone before your finger can get back there.. The system is obviously far less secure than what Apple is doing with Face ID , and definitely less secure than the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. I certainly wouldn't use this method if you're traveling or in other situations where your phone could be easily stolen. But it's secure enough for most people in most situations, and because it's so lightning quick I expect more than a few people will turn it on and stick with it most of the time.. OxygenOS flies on the OnePlus 5T ... but then the same software flies on the OnePlus 3T as well. It's very clear that this software isn't exactly taxing the Snapdragon 835 and 6 (or 8, in my case) gigabytes of RAM. Jumping between apps all day doesn't produce a single hiccup, and app performance has been great as well. I haven't noticed any excessive amount of background apps being killed off, nor have I had any unusual crashes or hangs from apps or the operating system itself.. The way OxygenOS does its transitional animations you can feel like things are a tad slower than, say, a Pixel 2 — but they're simply slow on purpose. If you're the type of person that cares about transition animation speed, you can freely change it in the developer settings — but it's more of just an acquired taste than an actual problem with the system.. Battery life remains unchanged from what I saw in the OnePlus 5. A 3300mAh battery is right on average with what we'd expect to see for a phone with a 6-inch display run by a Snapdragon 835 processor, and with the slim OxygenOS software it all equates to solid — but not spectacular — battery life. A typical full weekday left me with about 20% battery in the tank when heading to bed after 17 hours with 3-4 hours of "screen on" time. That's nearly on par with what I get out of the Pixel 2 XL , though I have found the OnePlus 5T hitting "Battery saver" (15%) in the evenings of some heavier usage days more frequently than Google's phone.. You'll get through a full day, and probably have a bit left in the tank when you're done.. The OnePlus 5T does a darn good job at conserving power when it's just sitting there with the screen off, which is once again a testament to OxygenOS being relatively light and simple. I can only imagine that the Oreo update will help further.. Dash Charge remains a fantastically quick charging solution, provided you buy another wall charger and perhaps a car charger to complete your set and know you have the fast charging everywhere you go. It's still a bit annoying that OnePlus hasn't managed to get this technology into its own mobile battery packs, or get some cross-compatibility with Qualcomm Quick Charge, but if you plan to stick with OnePlus it's worth getting its proprietary chargers.. Not a single thing about the main 16MP camera on the OnePlus 5T has changed from the 5. But OnePlus knows what it can get out of it, and thought it was good enough to hold onto — to counteract that, it put its effort into switching up the secondary camera. The new 20MP sensor sits behind the same focal length and f/1.7 aperture as the main camera now, putting a quick end to the telephoto lens idea from before.. The camera is one part of the experience befitting the 5T's price.. Camera performance is the one area where the OnePlus 5T feels spot on with its price: better than the cheap phones out there, but not as good as the top-tier flagships. In decent-to-good lighting, the 5T exhibits all of the same characteristics we've seen before: solid but unspectacular dynamic range, accurate colors and some areas where details get a bit over-smoothed by the image processing. The 5T tends to be accurate rather than punchy, which is fine with most of us, but when that's paired with questionable metering, weak dynamic range and an HDR mode that doesn't feel like it adds enough to the scene it leads to some photos coming out bland.. In anything resembling good lighting I never got a bad shot, and I even got a few great ones that could convince you they were from an $800+ phone, but the average shot out of the 5T is just ... They didn't "wow" me in the same way that the Pixel 2 XL does with just about every photo I take.. If you would like to download the original full-resolution versions of these camera samples, you can do so with this Dropbox link !. Why bother with this secondary camera if the main camera so often does a better job with low light photos?. Now let's talk about low-light photos. OnePlus tuned this secondary camera for very low light (under 10 lux, which is quite dark), and so the camera only engages automatically in those situations — you can't switch to it manually. I found it really hard to take a photo that was dark enough to engage that secondary camera, which honestly makes sense. A 20MP sensor with 1-micron pixels and no OIS supporting the lens just isn't a recipe for success in bad lighting, even if you do some processing that combines adjacent pixels to cut down on grain. And so, many of the photos both I and our own Daniel Bader caught with that second sensor were as bad as we expected them to be. Grainy, with some odd colors and weird artifacts where the software attempted to smooth things out. I actually took some solid low-light shots with the main camera — in fact, none of the camera samples above were taken with the secondary camera, because each time I took a shot with it I chose to reposition a bit for some more light and take it with the main camera instead for a better result.. It begs the question — why would OnePlus bother with this secondary camera at all if the main camera so often does a better job with low light photos? Some 90% of the shots you take with this phone will make no use of the secondary lens, turning it into this vestigial thing hanging around reminding you that its inclusion took away from potential improvements to the main camera. Yes, it enables a Portrait Mode — which doesn't seem to have improved since its introduction, and is worse than the Pixel 2 XL's — but I don't think that this software-based bokeh and what end up being relatively poor low-light shots are worth what we had to give up in the main camera. If the removal of those two features could free up resources to make any improvement in photos from the main camera thanks to a larger sensor or OIS, it'd be immediately worth it.. With a few price increases, OnePlus has worked itself up into a somewhat odd price level. At $499 the OnePlus 5T sits about $200 above the "budget" phones people so often look at when they're trying to save some money, but also $2-300 underneath the true flagship phones of the same size. It seems unlikely that someone considering buying a Moto G5 Plus for $299 outright will all of a sudden choose to spend $200 more for a OnePlus 5T; so the market instead consists of potential flagship phone buyers who are enticed by the call of a top-of-the-line phone for hundreds of dollars less.. The OnePlus 5T offers an exceptional value at $499, or even at $559 for the top-end model.. For this potential buyer, the OnePlus 5T delivers just as its predecessors did. It has the same type of hardware, build, form factor and screen quality as the top-end phones today, and a slate of specs to match. Sure it doesn't have the nice-to-have whizz-bang hardware features or extras like waterproofing or great speakers, but something had to be trimmed somewhere and these are great non-critical areas to cut costs. The camera won't blow you away, but it's good enough for this money and it's capable of a fantastic shot now and then. And even at this lower price, you get excellent software that's in many ways better than what Samsung, LG, HTC and Huawei are doing — and it all flows at a breakneck pace.. The OnePlus 5T isn't an industry-leading phone with the latest features that other companies will have to scramble to match. But it's still an exceptional value in an Android market that's getting surprisingly expensive at the top-end. The OnePlus 5T is a wonderful phone at $499, or even at $559 for the higher-spec model. At that price you can look past a couple hardware shortcomings and less-than-stellar cameras, because you just saved $200, $300 or even $400 off of leading phones from the "big name" companies while getting what is mostly the same — or in a couple cases, a better — daily experience..

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Dual-camera (20-megapixel, F1.7 aperture), Autofocus. Software Features: Manual focus, RAW image capture, Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets, Shutter speed control. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. 3840x2160 (4K) (30 fps), 1920x1080 (1080p HD) (60 fps), 1280x720 (720p HD) (120 fps). Features: Time-lapse video, Picture-taking during video recording, Digital image stabilization, Video calling, Video sharing. Features: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR). Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 2450 MHz, Kryo 280, 64-bit, 10 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

OnePlus 5T is official: 18:9 display, updated cameras, and a headphone jack!. by Williams Pelegrin November 16, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. The specs are mostly the same as the OnePlus 5’s. The fingerprint sensor is on the back now. You can unlock it with your face. There’s still no water resistance rating. The full list of OnePlus 5T specs. â There are quite a few specs we didn’t mention in this article, so you’ll want to head here for the full list. Weâll continually update this page as more deals and pricing information arises. â Take a closer look at OnePlus’ latest flagship smartphone.. 2016 saw an interesting shift in OnePlus ‘ smartphone strategy, in that the company chose to release a follow-up to the OnePlus 3 , the OnePlus 3T , a mere six months after the former. It was an iterative update, for sure, but an iterative update to arguably the most popular OnePlus smartphone since the original OnePlus One would be a beloved one regardless.. Fast forward to 2017, and OnePlus is adopting the same strategy by announcing the OnePlus 5T, the iterative successor to the OnePlus 5 released back in June. The OnePlus 5T has all the makings to go up against the best of them, such as a stretched-out display, facial recognition, and a new camera system, all in a package that promises to deliver a similar experience to that of a high-tier smartphone for a little over half the price.. Here’s what you need to know about the OnePlus 5T .. The first thing that people will notice regarding the OnePlus 5T is that new 18:9 aspect ratio display, which takes up most of the phone’s front. The new aspect ratio better guards the OnePlus 5T against its higher-priced competitors, which mostly feature stretched-out displays of their own, and it gives people more display area to work with while not increasing the footprint of the phone by much.. That being said, the taller display will make it tougher for folks looking for a one-handed experience with their smartphones. OnePlus also continues to insist on using a 1080p resolution for the display, which will grate those spoiled by Quad HD displays and those who like to consume content in VR.. The counter is that a 1080p screen won’t make the processor work as hard as a Quad HD panel, which should result in the former exhibiting better battery life by comparison. The debate will continue onward, but with most mid-tier smartphones now featuring 1080p resolution displays, OnePlus might do well to open up to Quad HD.. Thankfully, the OnePlus 5T’s changes are backed up by the same internals that made the OnePlus 5 an all-around solid performer. We’re looking at Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 paired with either 6 GB or 8 GB of RAM, with either 64 GB or 128 GB of native storage. Remember that there is no microSD card slot, so choose your storage configuration wisely.. OnePlus has retained the headphone jack for the OnePlus 5T, as well as the company’s proprietary Dash Charge technology that allows the phone to charge up the 3,300 mAh battery in a relatively short amount of time.. Read: Full OnePlus 5T specs. The OnePlus 5T’s stretched-out display might give the phone a solid aesthetic on the front, but it forced the fingerprint sensor to be moved to the back. This is a first for any OnePlus smartphone, which, apart from the OnePlus One and OnePlus X, have featured fingerprint sensors below the display.. The shift to the back allows OnePlus to incorporate gesture control, such as swiping to bring down the notification and quick settings dropdown and holding it to trigger the camera shutter when taking a selfie. Because the ceramic fingerprint sensor is located where your index finger might naturally rest anyway, these gestures feel intuitive and goes a long way to smoothing out the transition to a larger display.. Not only is the 16 MP front-facing shooter pretty weighty in the megapixel department, but OnePlus says it can also recognize your face, even when the display is off. This means that all you need to do is hit the power button and the OnePlus 5T should take you straight to the homescreen.. Interestingly, OnePlus stresses that this method of getting into your phone is less secure than the other available security options, so keep that in mind if you are skeptical about facial recognition security on smartphones. Even so, with the Galaxy S8 and iPhone X featuring their own takes on iris and facial recognition, the input method is bound to increase in popularity as time passes, so in that aspect, the OnePlus 5T is well-positioned for the future.. The OnePlus 5T’s face scanner and 18:9 aspect ratio display are nice to see, but arguably the most significant change is the new camera system. Whereas the OnePlus 5 used the second main camera as a telephoto lens, the OnePlus 5T implements something OnePlus calls “Intelligent Pixel Technology.”. In short, when taking low-light shots with the regular 16 MP camera, the secondary 20 MP camera is used to group pixels together in order for the original sensor to capture enough light and dark data. The result should be cleaner low-light shots, but the change also means that the secondary camera is no longer used for zoom and portrait images – they are now achieved through software.. Most flagship smartphones in 2017 come with some form of ingress protection. Google , HTC , LG , Samsung , and others all have IP67- or 68-rated smartphones, but unfortunately that’s not the case for OnePlus. Obviously including an IP rating on the 5T would have hiked the price up even more, but it still would have been nice to see this time around.. The OnePlus 5T doesn’t even feature splash resistance, so those looking to not worry about using their phones in the rain, while taking a shower, or while sitting by the pool might either look elsewhere or pick up a case.. Unlike Google’s latest Pixel phones and even Sony’s Xperia XZ1 and XZ1 Compact , the OnePlus 5T does not ship with Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box. Instead, we get a subtly-improved version of OxygenOS on top of Android 7.0 Nougat.. The changes OnePlus made to OxygenOS are welcome, such as its scalable Slate font to improve the viewing experience. It’s also nice to see display options like Night Mode and Reading Mode brought over from the OnePlus 5, and, combined with OxygenOS’ powerful underlays and outer simplicity, OnePlus has done a great job in further refining its take on Android.. Even so, the sting of an older Android version running the show is strongly felt. Oreo has been available to the public since late August, and to see a new phone released in November with Android Nougat is a bit depressing. Also worrisome is OnePlus’ software support, with the OnePlus 3T, a phone released last November, no longer receiving major Android updates past Oreo.. The OnePlus 5T should get updated to Oreo by year’s end, if OnePlus’ track record is anything to go by, but there is cause for a bit of concern for those who prioritize Android updates.. You can pre-order the OnePlus 5T through OnePlus’ official website starting 9am EST for either $499 with 6 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage or $559 for 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. There are no carrier deals for the OnePlus 5T in the US, though you can opt to pay for the phone over time if you opt for PayPal Credit as your payment option.. As for elsewhere, the phone will be available for pre-order through O2 in the UK, Three in Denmark, and Elisa in Finland starting today. For the US and Europe, the OnePlus 5T goes on sale November 21, with India and China needing to wait until November 21 and November 28, respectively.. Want to learn more about the OnePlus 5T?

This is a BETA experience. You may opt-out by clicking here. I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. OnePlus 5T's 6-inch OLED panel on display.. When I reviewed the OnePlus 5. this past June, I kicked off the article with a rather blunt. statement: " Let's just get this out of the way: The OnePlus 5. that ticks every box except for cutting-edge looks.". Well, OnePlus has went ahead and mostly fixed that last problem too with the 5T.. has dramatically chopped off the dated bezels of the 5, now sporting that near border-less screen look that gadget geeks have dreamed about for decades. With less dead space on top and below the display (and a switch to that narrower 18:9 aspect ratio pioneered by LG), OnePlus was able to bump the T's OLED display up. to 6-inches while keeping the phone roughly the same size as the previous 5.5-inch device.. After using the device for more than five days now, allow me to be direct again: the OnePlus 5T is the absolute best value in the smartphone market. Take it from someone who got his hands on like 30-plus smartphones this year, from the biggest of the big names (iPhone X) to most obscure brands you can think of (Oukitel, Vernee, Bluboo, etc). The big flagships from Samsung, LG, Huawei and Apple are still slightly better than the 5T in various ways (which I'll get to later) but the difference is not worth the extra $300-$400 for most people; and the 5T is a much better performer than all the other phones at its price point ($500 for the 64GB variant, $550 for the 128GB) or below.. The matte metal back feels and looks nice.. Because of the 5T's elongated screen that spans almost the entire face of the device, the fingerprint reader has been moved to the back, and the phone uses software buttons exclusively. Neither of these changes are radical departures to anyone familiar with Android phones, but even those who've used OnePlus phones exclusively for the past three years should be able to adapt to the new changes within half a day.. Other than that, the 5T is almost exactly the same as the 5: Snapdragon 835 processor with an insane 8GB of RAM (there is also a 6GB variant); a matte black aluminum back that feels every bit as polished and well-constructed as the iPhone 7 Plus' body; the same 16MP+20MP dual camera set-up from the 5 is back.. Due to its smaller bezels, the 5T uses software buttons exclusively.. The dual 16-megapixel and 20-megapixel set-up from the 5 returns.. As the processor and RAM combo suggests, the 5T is absolutely in the top one or two fastest/smoothest phone on the market. Helping things undoubtedly is OnePlus' OxygenOS, a. clean-looking skin that resembles stock Android but with a lot more customization options. I've said it time and time again -- OxygenOS is my favorite version of Android, and the experience on the 5T is a delight. Fancy assigning app launch shortcuts to button long presses? Want to the look of individual icons? Or the color scheme of the notification shade and settings page? You can do all of that in OyxgenOS.. The only area of the 5T that falls short of top-of-the-line flagship phones is photography, and even then the 5T is no slouch. In daylight, photos come out every bit as good as what you'd get from the iPhone X or Samsung Galaxy Note 8. It's only in night shots or low light situations do you see a difference between the A+ phones like Huawei Mate 10 Pro and iPhone X and a "mere" A phone like OnePlus 5T. Again, it's worth mentioning: the A+ phones cost at least $300 more than the OnePlus 5T.. But enough with the talk, let the photos do the talking. The first trio of photos you see below are all taken by the 5T, iPhone X and Galaxy Note 8 respectively, all using each phone's dedicated 2X zoom telephoto lens.. dynamic range, and color accuracy, all three images are very close. It's only when I viewed the photos at full size on a large monitor did I see that Samsung's image is the best, capturing the most minor of details such as building wall texture.. In this next set of images stitched side-by-side, the Huawei Mate 10 Pro's shot (right) captured a shot with more accurate colors, but otherwise the 5T's photo is every bit as crisp and aesthetically-pleasing.. 5T (left); Mate 10 Pro (right)..

How to disable an ad blocker on Business Insider. Tech Insider REVIEW: The O.... REVIEW: The OnePlus 5T is not only a bargain — it’s the best Android phone you can buy at any price. Antonio Villas-Boas , Business Insider US. The 5T’s screen is great, especially considering the device’s price. The 5T has a facial-recognition feature — and it works almost too well. But the phone’s fingerprint sensor can be finicky and frustrating to use. It has a very good camera. And its portrait mode works well, too. The 5T’s fast-charging feature works better than those of its rivals. And look! A headphone jack in 2017!. For less than $600, something’s got to give …. But because of the low price, I’m willing to make an exception for the 5T. The new OnePlus 5T is an excellent smartphone, but one thing about it stands out from the rest: its $500 price.. That amount is near the top of what OnePlus has charged for its past smartphones. But it’s hundreds of dollars cheaper than other top-of-the-line devices – many of the latest flagship smartphones, including Apple’s iPhone X and Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8, cost more than $900.. Given that, you could be forgiven for thinking OnePlus made some serious compromises with the 5T to get its price so comparatively low. While the 5T has some trade-offs, they aren’t meaningful. And I’d recommend the new phone even if it were to cost as much as its rivals.. Designwise, the 5T doesn’t stand out. It has most of the latest features of other contemporary phones, including narrow top and bottom borders around its screen, as well as a metallic back. Those elements make for a minimalistic, almost generic design. What is noticeable, though, is the thinness of the 5T compared with that of other top Android phones. On paper, the 7.3-mm-thick 5T may not seem that much thinner than Google’s 7.9-mm Pixel 2 XL or Samsung’s 8.6-mm Galaxy Note 8. But those fractions of a millimeter make a difference.. That thinness combined with its light weight make the 5T supremely comfortable to use.. The 5T’s display is on par with those of other top Android smartphones. It has a 6-inch Amoled screen with an 18:9 aspect ratio. That’s more elongated than the typical smartphone screen from as recently as last year.. Some spec-scrutinizers may think the 1080p resolution on the 5T’s display doesn’t match up well with the 1440p resolution offered on most other flagship Android devices. But you’d be hard-pressed to notice much of a difference when comparing the phones side by side.. Its vibrant colors and brightness and contrast levels equal those of displays of phones that cost $350 more.. Hiding underneath the 5T’s minimalist outer shell are specs that are as good or better than those of most of its rivals.. Like many of its newest competitors, the 5T includes Qualcomm’s powerful Snapdragon 835 processor. But it has more memory than most of its rivals. Most top Android smartphones come with 4 GB of RAM, whereas the base model of the 5T has 6 GB and the top model has a whopping 8 GB.. Typically, the more memory a device has, the faster it can switch among apps. And the 5T’s extra RAM may make a difference if you customize your phone with software that offers a greater range of Android design and setting options.. I’ve been testing the higher-end model of the 5T, which costs $560 and comes with 128 GB of storage and 8 GB of RAM. I haven’t noticed much of a difference in performance from the Pixel 2 XL, which has the same processor and half the RAM.. But I’m not going to complain about the extra memory, especially given that it’s included in the 5T’s sub-$600 price.. The 5T is the first OnePlus phone that comes with facial-recognition technology. The company nailed the feature, but it works almost too well.. When I press the power button on the 5T, the phone immediately unlocks and goes straight to my home screen. There’s no indication that it’s trying to recognize my face first. It works so quickly that it’s almost disconcerting. It feels as if the feature isn’t even turned on, and I don’t have any security measures in place.. In fact, I hardly ever see the lock screen on the 5T or the notifications it displays there. The only time is when I’m in a very dark area and the phone has trouble recognizing my face.. Because the feature works so well, I had to change how I check notifications. At first, I started angling the 5T away from my face so it wouldn’t unlock while I was going through my lock-screen alerts. Realizing that was ridiculous, I now check my alerts by pulling down the Android notifications shade after my phone unlocks and view them there.. But as good as the 5T’s facial-recognition system is, it’s not on par with Face ID on Apple’s iPhone X. The 5T didn’t recognize my face when I was wearing sunglasses, for example. That made me doubt whether it would recognize users when they got haircuts or were wearing makeup.. Still, the 5T has a big advantage over the iPhone X: It also has a fingerprint sensor. So if its facial-recognition system doesn’t work for you, you can always use your fingers to unlock it.. To make room for the 5T’s larger display and offer thinner borders around its screen, OnePlus moved the fingerprint sensor to the phone’s back. Unfortunately, that makes it hard to use.. The sensor is flush with the case, so it can be difficult to find without looking at it. And it’s not very forgiving – it wouldn’t unlock my phone unless I put my finger squarely on it right from the start. It didn’t like it when, while blindly hunting for the sensor, I slid my finger over to the middle after discovering its edge.. In this way, the 5T’s fingerprint sensor is like the Samsung’s Galaxy S8’s.. By contrast, the fingerprint sensor on the Pixel 2 XL is a lot less picky, and those on previous OnePlus phones were easier to use because they were on the front.. Overall, it’s much easier to unlock the 5T with the facial-recognition system.. The 5T’s camera compares favorably with those of other top phones.. The pictures it makes are ike those of Apple’s iPhones, and the color palette is warmer than that of Google’s Pixel 2 devices, which yield photos with more neutral tones.. Its HDR – high dynamic range – feature works very well, bringing out great details in the shadows of brightly lit shots.. The 5T has a 16-megapixel primary camera. That’s superior to the cameras in other top Android phones, which typically are 12-megapixel shooters. But I didn’t see much better sharpness from those additional pixels.. Like many other recent phones, the 5T has a dual-lens camera system. Its secondary camera is a 20-megapixel one. Instead of using the secondary camera to offer an optical zoom feature, as the latest iPhones do and the previous OnePlus phone did, the 5T uses it to improve photos shot in dim light.. Low-light photos shot with the 5T are sharper than those taken with previous OnePlus phones. However, both Samsung’s Galaxy phones and the Pixel 2 do a better job in low light.. A low-light photo taken with the OnePlus 5T.. The 5T’s portrait mode, which blurs out the background of a subject, is very good.. Like the Pixel 2’s portrait mode – but unlike that of the latest iPhones – the 5T’s does a great job of keeping the entire subject in focus.. OnePlus’ Dash Charge fast-charging feature should be the standard for all smartphones. It essentially keeps all the heat-emitting charging elements in the adapter, so the phone doesn’t get hot when it’s plugged in.. In addition to keeping the 5T cool, the feature allows it to charge faster than rival devices. Other Android phones with fast charging will slow down when they get hot to prevent overheating.. Additionally, I have no complaints about the 5T’s battery life.. There are at least two notable features you’ll find on other top devices but not on the 5T: wireless charging and water-resistance.. For me, the lack of those features isn’t a deal-breaker, especially because of the 5T’s relatively low price. Wireless charging is slow and is more of an extra convenience than a necessity. Fast charging – via OnePlus’ Dash Charge system – is much more important.. And while the 5T isn’t officially water-resistant, OnePlus says it can handle light sprinkles. It might be able to withstand a lot more – some courageous OnePlus owners have posted YouTube videos showing that previous OnePlus phones can handle water pretty darn well .. For me, the two features an Android phone needs to have are an unmodified version of the operating system and the ability to get Android updates as soon as Google releases them.. Those requirements have always limited me to Google’s devices – first its Nexus line and now its Pixel phones. Good thing, then, that those were or are among the best Android phones you could buy.. The 5T essentially meets my first requirement. Its version of Android is about 99% similar to what you’ll find on the Pixel phones. The only notable thing missing is the Pixel Launcher, an extra layer of features that Google reserves for its phones.. But the 5T doesn’t meet my second requirement – OnePlus devices generally don’t get the latest versions of Android as soon as Google releases them. As a case in point, the 5T runs Android 7.1, while Google’s new Pixel 2 devices run Android 8.0.. However, for the 5T, I’m willing to bend my rules. It is just such a good smartphone for such a good price that I’m not going to rule it out because of that.. In fact, I’d go further and say that if you’re in the market for an Android phone, you should buy the 5T. There’s little reason to get any other device unless you absolutely have to have the latest Android updates immediately – or you enjoy spending more money than you need to.. There is one big caveat, though: The 5T doesn’t work on Verizon’s network. So if you’re wedded to Verizon, as I am, you’ll have to get a different phone.. The OnePlus 5T went on sale on Wednesday, and it’s available from OnePlus’ site .. TAGS Android BI Graphics Features OnePlus OnePlus 5T Reviews Smartphones. Antonio Villas-Boas , Business Insider US.

OnePlus 5T review: The best smartphone under Rs 35,000 in India. After using the phone for three weeks, it’s easy to conclude, that the OnePlus 5T is now a proper flagship.. Despite its borrowed design (which comes from Oppo), the new taller display brings it shoulder to shoulder with current day flagships.. The tweaked camera hardware delivers better Portrait photos but still falls short in terms of quality.. Facial unlock is fun, fast and almost accurate but is only available for unlocking your smartphone (which makes it purpose-built in a way). While these subtle improvements will appeal to new OnePlus adopters, fans who purchased the OnePlus 5 will be left fuming at the Chinese brand.. But at the end of it all, it does make the OnePlus 5T more appealing and worthwhile than the OnePlus 5. Which finally, makes it… a good buy!. Honestly, there are no noticeable differences on the OnePlus 5T when you compare it to the OnePlus 5; save for the missing fingerprint reader that now sits on the back. The smartphone is all about that taller and bigger display and how OnePlus has managed to fit it in the same footprint as the older smartphone.. With that said, it’s no biggie, the company’s sibling’s Vivo and Oppo have done the same and Xiaomi has done a better job with the Mi Mix 2 , so there’s nothing revolutionary and anything worth bragging about the design either.. Those fancy covers are totally worth their price tags as well.. The fingerprint reader has moved to the rear and now sits below the camera. This may be a welcome move for some and a not so great move for those (like me) who prefer its placement on the front of the device. Still, it is not a deal breaker as OnePlus has included a handy facial unlock feature, which seems purpose-built as it does not do anything else. More on this in the Software section.. Thanks to the new 18:9 display, this OnePlus looks like it was designed in 2017.. With display turned off, the smartphone may still look the same as the OnePlus 5 (save for the missing fingerprint reader on the front). But the fit and finish have improved (I said improved, not polished to perfection) to an extent and in my opinion, it makes the device feel a bit more premium-looking than the first iteration.. That raised dual camera looks cool but also hides the NFC antenna in the ridge above it.. The dual camera setup on the back of the device feels better finished and the glossy ring around the lens lends to the premium minimalist look. The tiny notch above the camera ring is actually the antenna for the NFC feature.. The 5T feels better overall, but it's no HTC U11.. Overall, it’s a drastic improvement over the OnePlus 5’s camera setup which felt abnormally sharp. The same goes for the bottom end where the USB port now feels smoother (read not as sharp as the OnePlus 5) and won’t scratch your pinky when you place it there to support the phone. It’s really about these tiny improvements that make for a better overall product.. At the end of it all, the OnePlus 5T now looks and feels like a device that you would spend your hard-earned money on, even though it quite does not match the level of polish of the premium flagship smartphones (the volume and power buttons rattle a bit). Then again, the Samsung Note 8 , HTC U11 , and Apple iPhones are priced that way as well.. The OnePlus 5T right about packs in the same hardware as the OnePlus 5 with a few improvements. There’s a new 6.01-inch Full HD+ (2160x1080 pixels) Optic AMOLED display which cuts down on the bezels and manages to fit the bigger display in the same footprint as the previous smartphone.. Inside, we get the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset paired with 6 GB / 8 GB RAM and 64 GB / 128 GB internal storage variants. You still cannot expand your storage because there is no microSD card slot, like every other OnePlus handset before the 5T.. The camera setup is different from the OnePlus 5.. The cameras have seen a slight change. Gone is the telephoto lens with 1.6x optical zoom from the setup. OnePlus has now opted for a standard lens with the same 20 MP sensor with the same parameters as the 16 MP camera. So why would OnePlus do this? More on this in detail in the Camera section of the review.. Connectivity options remain the same as before. And so does the battery which remains at 3,300 mAh meaning that it has some heavy lifting to do with the increased display size.. If the display on the OnePlus 5 annoyed you, you will be happy to know that there is quite an improvement offered by the 5T. The Optic AMOLED unit has been tuned quite well and is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5 which is as scratch resistant as the one on the OnePlus 5.. The 5T now features additional Screen Calibration modes to the mix and offers a total of 5 modes as compared to the past 3 modes, which felt a bit limited.. The 18:9 display looks great and performs leagues better than the one on the OnePlus 5.. There’s a Default mode that showcases higher saturation, an sRGB mode for more muted tones and even a DCI-P3 mode for the most accurate colour tones. Seeing the DCI-P3 setting felt a bit gimmicky as Android Oreo is the first software update to define colour spaces and as we all know, Oreo is not too popular among Android smartphone manufacturers these days. There’s also an Adaptive mode, which does what it says and even a Custom colour mode that lets you adjust the tone to your liking.. The new display was leagues better to begin with as it did not showcase that annoying jelly effect when scrolling through content within apps. There’s minimal colour shifting when viewing the display off centre, but the usual AMOLED red tinge was present. The display cannot be mistaken for an LCD, nor does it even come close to the one on the Note 8 or the Pixel 2, but it’s a good one nonetheless and is a perfect fit for a smartphone priced in this segment.. I can imagine this conversation between a Nokia 8 fan and a OnePlus 5T fan.. "Aaj mere paas Snapdragon 835 hai, 8 GB RAM hai, 128 GB internal storage hai, Dash charging hai, dual camera hai..kya hai kya hai tumhare pass?". Nokia 8 fan: "Mere paas Android Oreo hai.". While I was happy to see almost stock Android with Nougat on the OnePlus 5, plenty has happened in past 5 months. Google launched the Pixel 2 , Sony also launched its Xperia XZ1. Next up we have the Nokia 8 , which sits in the same price bracket and it too was recently upgraded to Android 8.0 Oreo.. Same old stuff, but its gets the job done.. So it was a bit of a shock when OnePlus unveiled a new smartphone on-stage without the latest Android software out of the box. To make things worse, OnePlus just has 3 smartphones to develop Android ROMs for (even Apple has more phones to worry about) so there is no excuse to show up with an older generation OS at launch. At the time of writing this review, there is no confirmed date for a rollout in sight either. And software is a big deal. since performance and numbers (bragging rights) are usually considered important for OnePlus fans.. How to get to the Reading Mode of the OnePlus 5T.. Apart from having the same old stuff (or the features that others already have on offer), there is a new Reading mode present on the 5T.. It can be accessed in the toggles or you can head to Display Settings. appears to be quite handy for those who read a lot on their smartphones. Turning it on will mute the colours and turn on a black and white mode. This can be switched on manually or even set to turn on when certain apps are opened. It’s purely to reduce stress on your eyes when reading for long periods, but it’s not designed to save battery life if that’s what you were expecting it to do.. Another interesting feature is Face Unlock. It works quite well in most of the decent lighting conditions you will ever encounter, cannot be fooled with photographs, and needs you to be awake when you unlock it. It does not work well, in dimly lit environments and definitely not in a completely dark environment. And that’s that because all it will ever be used for is unlocking your smartphone and nothing else, it’s just not secure enough like Apple’s Face ID or Huawei’s Point Cloud Depth Camera.. OnePlus smartphones have always focused on the performance factor and the 5T is no different. The unit we received for review came with 8 GB RAM so I did not come across any lag or performance issues whatsoever. Since the OnePlus is still stuck with Android Nougat, I expected it to be polished to perfection and expected no hiccups. Thankfully, there were none since the software is almost stock with minimal bloatware that comes pre-installed.. Software aside, the gaming experience was similar to the OnePlus 5. The 5T’s wider 18:9 display does deliver a more immersive gaming experience, letting you see more on the display than you normally would on a 16:9 display. There’s no heating issues, and the games ran smoothly without any hiccups or drop in frame rates.. OnePlus 5T Performance Benchmarks Infogram. OnePlus still offers a headphone jack! (But so does, Sony, Samsung and LG this year) The audio sounds as good as on the OnePlus 5, which is rich and is good enough for you to chuck that MP3 player out the window. At the same time, there is nothing exclusive here, especially no major leap for Bluetooth audio unlike what we have been seeing on the Sony Xperia XZ1, which is the only smartphone apart from the Pixel 2 to support high-resolution audio formats (aptX HD is still only half as good as LDAC). But hey, they do offer you an audio jack!. The single speaker is loud and clear and with the recent software update is good enough for you to throw your headphones in the bag, while binge-watching Netflix shows in bed on a lazy weekend. But these will not be seen in high definition resolution. Neither Netflix, Amazon Prime Video nor Hotstar shows you content in HD. OnePlus 5T lacks the Widevine Level 1 DRM which is required to stream HD content. OnePlus has said that it is working on a fix for that, so you will have to wait and watch.. Call quality too is great and I faced no problems placing and answering calls.. While the camera setup on the OnePlus 5T may look similar to the OnePlus 5. The technology behind it is a lot different. OnePlus replaced its telephoto lens with a standard one and now both cameras offer wide apertures of f/1.7. OnePlus went with pixel binning on the 20 MP unit, which basically combines four pixels into one. But this camera and technology kicks in only when the light is lower than 10 lux. Theoretically, all of the above improvements should deliver low light images that are brighter and with less noise.. While the images turned out great in well-lit indoor situations and in bright daylight, the results were average in low light. The noise levels when shooting in the standard auto mode, has reduced drastically. This was a problem on the OnePlus 5. But with the noise, the details too seem to disappear, especially in dimly lit conditions like street lighting.. Next, I tried out plenty of shots using the Portrait mode, which should work better considering that annoying telephoto lens is now out of sight. The results as expected were drastically better, but again, only in the comparison to the OnePlus 5. The focussing system was fast, but you will really need your subject to hit a pose (and stay that way) to get a great shot. Else the lack of OIS makes it absence felt with blurry edges.. There is quite an improvement when you compare Portrait mode samples between the OnePlus 5 (left) and the 5T (right).. The Portrait mode’s feathering and masking were a lot more accurate than the OnePlus 5, but there’s still a lot left to be desired in this day and age when smartphones like the Google Pixel 2 can do a lot more using just one camera. I may be comparing apples to oranges here, but I would expect something better at Rs 37,999. Rs 32,999 sounds a lot better given the 5T’s camera performance.. The lack of a telephoto lens means you don't have to stand a mile away from your subject like the OnePlus 5 (left). The results are better too (right 5T).. Selfies look great, provided they are shot in good lighting conditions. Disappointed with the camera performance, I was surprised to see such impressive Full HD 60 fps video capture on the OnePlus 5T. EIS certainly works well out here and delivers smooth frame rates and this works well even while panning the camera. Low light video recording too looked decent. The 4k recording did feel a bit lacking.. Just like the OnePlus 5, the OnePlus 5T with its choice of an AMOLED display, 10 nm chipset and right software tuning, managed to get a lot out of the same 3,300 mAh battery despite the increase in screen size.. I managed to get a full work day and more, out of a single charge. And even when the battery drained, with a lot of heavy gaming, Dash Charge always came to the rescue.. I have been using the OnePlus 5T for almost three weeks now. While my review of the OnePlus 5 was critical , I can justify it by the fact that the 5 was a badly crafted smartphone with a problematic display and an average camera.. With the OnePlus 5T, things haven’t changed much in terms of construction and build quality, what has changed is the display that now makes for an attractive package, despite its average camera performance.. Five months after the OnePlus 5, the OnePlus 5T does not come with a core hardware upgrades like the 3T did with an upgraded chipset and battery, but simply improves on the stuff it messed up on the OnePlus 5.. The OnePlus 5T is now a complete package and will rule the sub Rs 35,000 segment until a worthy challenger arrives.. In short, the OnePlus 5T still isn’t worth spending Rs 37,999 on, if a good camera is all you are seeking. You will find a better one on the Samsung Galaxy S7 at Rs 33,000 (it also comes with an IP 68 rating). However, the 6 GB RAM and 64 GB storage option at Rs 32,999 sounds a lot more appealing when you consider that 18:9 display.. At Rs 32,999 it is hard to recommend anything else at the moment, but Huawei’s upcoming AI-powered Honor V10 (or View 10) may turn out be a competitor. Buyers, however, will have to wait until January for it to launch in India. Talk about being late to a party, Honor!. While I feel bad for every OnePlus 5 owner out there, it is the way things are expected to be with OnePlus. And with buyers learning OnePlus’ product refresh cycle, it’s easy to say that nobody (including OnePlus fans) in their right mind, would buy the next OnePlus 6, but would wait for a slightly polished 6T instead.. The OnePlus 5T (128GB, 8GB) features a 6.0-inch Full Optic AMOLED display with a resolution of 1080 x 2160 pixels and is powered by a 2.45GHz octa core processor and has 8GB of RAM. It comes with 128GB of inbuilt storage and has a 20.0+16.0 megapixel rear camera and 16.0-megapixel front camera. It comes with Android 7.1 Nougat OS and support a 3300mAh battery capacity with 3G & 4G.. 5.0, supports aptX & aptX HD. 75 x 7.3 x 156.1 mm.

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. OnePlus 5T hands-on: A slightly bigger, slightly better flagship. This is what the OnePlus 5 should’ve been to start with.. The OnePlus 5 isn't that old, but it's already been replaced. The company just unveiled its new flagship smartphone at a launch event in Brooklyn, and it's understandably pumped about its new, almost-all-screen design. I've been playing with the 5T for a few days already, and it's a shaping up to be a powerful, pretty machine that's sure to make existing OnePlus 5 owners feel a little envious. If that's you, well, you don't need to feel too left out: In many ways, the 5T is still the same phone from earlier this year.. Frankly, it's a little strange that the OnePlus 5T exists at all. The company set a precedent last year when it released the OnePlus 3 in June, and quickly followed up with the improved OnePlus 3T just months later. That's essentially what happened here, but company representatives were quick to point out in conversation that the original plan was to focus solely on one phone -- the OnePlus 5 -- this year. You know what they say about best-laid plans. Note that this doesn't mean OnePlus is committed to a two-phones-per-year strategy — it has never publicly committed to that. In this case, it just seemed like the company found the right big screen for the right price and said, "Eh, why not?". Gallery: OnePlus 5T hands-on photos | 18 Photos. And what a lovely screen it is. OnePlus went with a 6-inch, Samsung-made AMOLED panel surrounded by narrow bezels below it and on the sides. The amount of empty space around the panel is roughly the same as on the LG V30 , so it's no surprise that both are easy to grip. More importantly, the screen is bright and vivid enough that it's easy to forget it runs at 1080p — for those keeping count, that works out to a 401-ppi pixel density. That's a lower pixel density than what you'd get out of, say, a Galaxy S8 Plus , but the screen's still crisp enough that you can't spot individual pixels so the trade-off hasn't left me wanting. Still, OnePlus says the decision to stay at 1080p mostly came down to power and performance considerations, though it's worth noting devices like the S8 Plus handled the jump to 2K just fine. The screen is definitely the biggest change to the OnePlus formula, but the tweaks don't end there. Because there's no longer room for a fingerprint sensor under the screen, OnePlus moved it to the back. This won't sit well with some people, but I actually prefer this setup, even if it requires you to pick up the phone to unlock it. (It helps that the fingerprint sensor is still superfast.) To mitigate some of the potential blowback surrounding this decision, OnePlus also whipped up a handy "Face Unlock" feature.. Just to make it absolutely clear, this is a much less secure way to unlock the 5T. There's no clever technical trickery here, and no iPhone X -style infrared camera. Instead, the setup process has you staring at the screen while the phone uses its front-facing camera to spot "over 100" facial points it'll use to identify you going forward. I haven't been able to fool the feature with a picture of myself (yet), but it's at least theoretically possible. And beyond that, the lack of any additional hardware to power Face Unlock means the feature doesn't really work in the dark.. This isn't exactly an ideal solution, but it is a very fast one. Unlocking the 5T with my face was essentially instantaneous; most of the time, it felt like I was unlocking a phone with no security measures at all. Face Unlock's performance is as impressive as it is convenient, and that's exactly what the company was going for. You can't use your face to authenticate Play Store purchases or anything; situations like that still require you to use the more secure fingerprint sensor.. OnePlus also made some tweaks to its dual camera, though it's sometimes hard to tell. Once again, the 5T combines a 16-megapixel main camera and a 20-megapixel secondary camera, and that latter sensor got most of the attention. It now has an f/1.7 aperture to match the main shooter and is meant mainly to improve the phone's low-light camera performance. When things around you get dark, the phone switches into that second camera that combines multiple pixels into one, all in an attempt to make pictures look brighter than they otherwise would have. The difference is noticeable, but I wouldn't call it a game-changer.. So far, the photos I've taken with the 5T have been pretty good — I'm especially fond of some of the blurry-background portraits I've shot — but many shots are soundly outclassed by those captured with rival smartphones. Don't get me wrong, improved low-light performance is always a good thing and the 5T is occasionally capable of excellent photos. It's just that we've seen some truly incredible smartphone cameras this year. I'll need a little more time with the phone to see how well it stacks up against the competition.. Other than that, the 5T is almost identical to the phone it replaces. It's just a hair thicker, longer and wider than the 5, but these gains are so incremental they're completely unnoticeable. And yes, those eagle-eyed phone fiends were right: The 5T bears a striking resemblance to other devices, especially Oppo's R11S. OnePlus admits that it "leverages" the Oppo supply chain when it benefits the company, but insists that any similarities are purely coincidental. I'll let you be the judge of that.. Unlike last year's 3T, which boasted a faster chipset than the 3, the OnePlus 5T uses the same Snapdragon 835 chipset as its predecessor. It's available in the exact same configurations, too: 6GB of RAM with 64GB of storage, or 8GB of RAM with 128GB of storage. I've been working with the latter, and there's no difference in performance between the OnePlus 5 and 5T. That's mostly a good thing, because the original 5 was already super-snappy, and the reliably clean version of OxygenOS (based on Android 7.1.1) definitely helps keep everything moving remarkably smoothly. While it's sort of a bummer that a phone launching this late in the year doesn't run Android 8.0 Oreo, OnePlus says a beta build of OxygenOS running on Oreo will be available by the end of 2017. Also unchanged is the 5T's battery -- it's the same 3,300mAh cell that was used in the 5, and in general I've easily been getting more than a full day's use out of it before needing a recharge. That the 5T's battery life is seemingly very close to the 5 is a pleasant surprise; I thought for sure I'd see the runtime take a bigger hit thanks to that bigger screen. That said, I haven't put the phone through the full review wringer yet, so it'll be a little while before the real differences in power consumption become apparent. If nothing else, OnePlus's Dash Charging system still works well. Ten minutes of charging typically netted me an extra 15 and 20 percent of battery life, while fully charging a bone-dry 5T took about an hour.. I have a lot more testing to do before rendering a final verdict on the OnePlus 5T, but it feels like this is the device OnePlus 5 should've been in the first place. There's nothing to be done about the past, though, and the 5T feels like a worthy successor to the 5 in just about every way that matters. Basically, your holiday smartphone-shopping decision just got a little harder. That said, OnePlus still has its work cut out for it: There's some lingering distrust among some users from when the company seemingly meddled with benchmark results, not to mention recent concerns about software snooping. We'll soon see if the OnePlus 5T is enough to get smartphone fans feeling the faith again.. android , gear , hands-on , mobile , oneplus , oneplus5 , oneplus5t , preview , smartphone.

OnePlus 5T review: Because OnePlus couldn’t settle with just OnePlus 5. Featuring an 18:9 bezel-less display, OnePlus 5T scores high on design and performance. Updated: Nov 28, 2017 09:33 IST. OnePlus 5T: Is it the best value for money smartphone?(OnePlus). OnePlus has travelled a long from way from just being an enthusiasts-only brand to the top selling brand in the premium segment in India. The company debuted in India almost three years ago with “the flagship killer” moniker – a direct dig at then premium smartphones that were simply too expensive.. The idea was very simple – to deliver a phone that has premium smartphone-like specifications and features and price that’s almost half of that the premium phones. The strategy has clearly worked for the company.. With its latest OnePlus 5T , the company is banking on its tried and tested formula to work. But this is certainly not negative for a company that has 62.2% market share in the premium smartphone market. The erstwhile ‘flagship killer’ OnePlus 5 was the highest-selling phone in the third quarter of this year, according to the latest report by research firm IDC.. That said, OnePlus’ emphasis on launching a ‘T’-version of its flagship phone in smaller span of time has received a mixed response. For instance, my former colleague was little baffled that the company had launched the last year’s OnePlus 3T had minor upgrades, though enough to make his OnePlus 3 obsolete soon enough.. With OnePlus 5T, the company has made it clear that the T series is going to stay. I’ve been using OnePlus 5T as my primary smartphone for approximately two weeks. The smartphone may be an incremental upgrade over OnePlus 5, but as a standalone phone, it’s quite impressive.. We have talked about the design and overall form-factor of OnePlus 5T in lenth in our detailed first impressions. If you are too lazy to click the hyperlink, let us briefly explain what’s changed. OnePlus 5T comes with an 18:9 full-screen 6.01-inch full HD+ full Optic AMOLED display.. The key thing to note is that the screen has been crammed into almost same dimensions as OnePlus 5. The new phone, however, is marginally taller, thicker and heavier than the predecessor. The inclusion of an 18:9 display brings OnePlus on par with the hot trend of bezel-less phones and in our opinion, the company has done good job at it. OnePlus 5T display isn’t mind-blowing like iPhone X or Note 8, but looking at the price point, it’s fairly close.. 6.01-inch 18:9 Display with 1080 x 2160 pixels resolution Snapdragon 835 processor + 6GB/8GB RAM 64GB/128GB built-in storage 16+20 MP Dual Rear Camera 16MP Front Camera 3300 mAh battery. While the improvement in design is certainly a welcome addition, OnePlus 5T doesn’t disappoint with its performance either. The smartphone handles almost everything with ease. And, I have thrown at it almost everything – prolonged sessions of multimedia streaming, playing graphic-intensive games such as Marvel: Clash of Champions, South Park: Phone Destroyer, and run a number of apps without killing anyone of them in the background.. That said, I am skeptical about OnePlus’ custom OxygenOS, which isn’t completely glitch-free. Except for one occasion I didn’t come across any noticeable lag during my usage. That one occasion wherein the phone stopped recognising my passcode to unlock the device got fixed with a simple turn on/off.. The near-excellent performance is complemented by a great battery life. The smartphone can easily see a day on medium to heavy usage on single charge. Light users can easily draw juice for more than 24 hours. OnePlus’ propriety fast charging technology “Dash Charging” is pretty good as well. It will fully charge your phone in less than 40 minutes (of course, if you use the original bundled charger).. Rs 32,999 for 6GB RAM + 64 GB storage variant Rs 37,999 for 8GB RAM + 128GB storage variant. Another major upgrade that OnePlus 5T brings is photography. The smartphone camera thrives when there’s abundant ambient light but don’t expect Galaxy Note 8 or iPhone X photo quality from the phone. It takes good photos for its price point. OnePlus 5T isn’t really the phone I’d recommend for low-light photography. However, this could be temporary as the company’s next major update to the phone focuses on selfies and low-light photography. As far as selfies go, OnePlus 5T is fine. I have used better selfie phones, but looking at the overall proposition, we can easily ignore this element.. OnePlus also features an iPhone X-like facial recognition technology for biometric authentication. As mentioned in our first impressions, the facial recognition works well and is quite fast .. All said and done, OnePlus 5T is a value for money smartphone. We are not sure if it’s still aiming to sink the flagships, but as a standalone smartphone, it’s quite good and worth considering under Rs 40,000. A combination of contemporary design and trusted performance really works in favour of OnePlus 5T.. MWC 2018: Vivo APEX concept smartphone with world’s first half-screen fingerprint scanner launched.

The Guardian - Back to home. What term do you want to search?. The OnePlus 5T offers great performance, excellent battery life and big screen for significantly less than the competition.. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian. OnePlus 5T review: premium full-screen experience at half cost of iPhone X. OnePlus has done it again, producing a smartphone with almost its rivals’ high-end features, including 36-hour battery life, at an affordable price. Mon 20 Nov 2017 14.00. Last modified on Mon 20 Nov 2017 15.35. The fingerprint scanner on the back is one of the best in the business. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian. Screen: 6in full HD AMOLED (401ppi). Processor: octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. RAM: 6 or 8GB of RAM. Operating system: Oxygen OS based on Android 7.1.1. Camera: 16MP + 20MP rear dual camera, 16MP front-facing camera. Connectivity: LTE, dual sim, Wi-Fiac, NFC, Bluetooth 5 and GPS. Dimensions: 156.1 x 75 x 7.3mm. Smooth performance and long battery life. The OnePlus 5T has great battery life and charges really fast, thanks to the company’s Dash Charge technology. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian. Oxygen OS comes with lots of little customisation options and gestures. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian. The OnePlus Camera app is much improved since last year, and is now one of the best in the business. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian. The optional ambient screen is clear and easy to read even in direct sunlight and didn’t appear to have much of an effect on the excellent battery life. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian. The USB-C port has quite sharp edges that are uncomfortable on my little finger when held at certain angles. It comes with a screen protection pre-installed and a soft plastic case in the box. Dash Charge works great, but the 5T requires OnePlus’s power adapter and cable to fast-charge. Dual-sim support means you can have two mobile phone numbers and plans at the same time in one phone. The alert slider that switches between ring, silent and do not disturb modes is great. OnePlus has had its support issues in the past but co-founder Carl Pei has pledged to improve support and software updates for current and new customers. The 6in screen is brilliant for watching video. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian. Samsung Galaxy S8+ review: the best plus-sized screen you can buy.

Huawei Mate 10 Pro review: say hello to two-day battery life. iPhone 8 Plus review: still massive – but not in a good way. iPhone X review: Apple finally knocks it out of the park. The OnePlus 5T propels the Chinese company into the brave new era of full-screen smartphones, with a new 6in minimal bezel display squeezed into the body of a 5.5in device.. The 5T is OnePlus’s fourth phone in two years. Unlike the OnePlus 3 to 3T upgrade in 2016, the internal components for the 5T have mostly stayed the same as those of the OnePlus 5 , with the screen and camera the biggest differences.. The 6in full HD+ AMOLED screen takes priority, stretching to fill the front of the device, bar the slim bezels at the sides and the relatively small top and bottom panels. It doesn’t look quite as impressively “full screen” as Apple’s iPhone X or Samsung’s Galaxy S8 , but the 5T has visibly smaller bezels than most, including the Google Pixel 2 XL .. The screen isn’t as high resolution as some competitors, sticking with full HD+ as Huawei did for its Mate 10 Pro , but most won’t care because it clearly benefits battery life. It looks great with good contrast, solid viewing angles and your choice of colour calibration including sRGB and DCI-P3. It looks particularly good with full-screen video.. The back of the device has a gentle curve, making it feel great to hold, and a minimalist aesthetic in all black, with only the etched logo, fingerprint scanner, dual camera and flash visible. The antenna lines bend round the top and bottom edges in the same way they do on the OnePlus 5.. The fingerprint scanner on the back is genuinely great – up there with the best of them in speed and accuracy.. The OnePlus 5T feels solid in the hand, but weighing only 162g it is relatively light for a 6in smartphone. Most devices of that size weigh over 170g, including the 174g iPhone X , the 173g Samsung Galaxy S8+ , the 175g Google Pixel 2 XL and the 178g Huawei Mate 10 Pro .. The 5T is also thinner than most at 7.3mm thick, and is 1.7mm narrower than the Pixel 2 XL, meaning you’re losing nothing in the design despite the phone’s reduced cost. You even get a headphone socket at the bottom, which makes the OnePlus one of the last top-end smartphones to still have one.. The only thing missing is water resistance. Where most flagship smartphones have a water resistance rating of IP67 or greater, the 5T lacks such assurances.. The OnePlus 5T has the same specifications as the OnePlus 5 and therefore the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor as used in the majority of top-end smartphones , but with more RAM than most, and options of either 6GB or 8GB.. Performance is excellent all round, with a level of sprightliness only seen on Android with the new Pixel 2 XL and Mate 10 Pro with Android Oreo. It’s testament to how much optimisation OnePlus clearly performs with its software, meaning I’m expecting great things once the 5T is updated to Oreo in the first quarter of 2018.. If you want Pixel-level smoothness, the 5T is as close as you can get without buying a Google phone.. One thing that has improved since the OnePlus 5 is battery life. Despite the larger screen the OnePlus 5T lasted more than 34 hours between charges, meaning I could start using it at 7am and it would make it all way the way through to gone 5pm on the next day.. That was while using the OnePlus 5T as my primary device with two sims loaded in it, browsing and using apps for six hours with hundreds of push emails and messages, watching 90 minutes of Netflix, taking around 30 photos and listening to around six hours of music via Bluetooth headphones. Most users will easily be able to go two days between charges.. The OnePlus 5T also charges really fast using the company’s proprietary Dash Charge system. Going from zero to 70% charge took just over 33 minutes, which means you’ll get around a day’s charge in well under 30 minutes.. The OnePlus 5T runs Oxygen OS 4.7, the company’s customised version of Android 7.1.1 Nougat, not the latest Android 8 Oreo that is available on a variety of new top-end smartphones.. Overall, Oxygen OS is a refined experience, which is only slightly tweaked from what is considered the standard Android experience. Small additions include the ability to run two versions of the same app side by side, such as two instances of WhatsApp for two phone numbers, which works very well, and more customisation options. Users can switch the order of the navigation keys, change status icons and use a variety of gestures to launch apps or features.. Oxygen OS is a very smooth and well implemented version of Android, it’s just a shame the OnePlus 5T isn’t launching with a version based on the improved Android 8 Oreo.. The OnePlus 5T’s dual-camera system is slightly different to that fitted to the 5. Instead of having one camera with a wide-angle lens and another with a telephoto lens, allowing users to get a 2x optical zoom, the 5T’s two cameras both have f/1.7 lenses.. The main 12-megapixel camera takes care of most duties, with help from the 20-megapixel secondary camera, which is great for depth effects such as portrait mode. But in low light conditions the phone switches over to the 20-megapixel camera, which combines four pixels into one to improve low-light performance, and for the most part it appears to work.. Low light shots were better than the OnePlus 5, with relatively good detail even in photos taken in dim street lighting. It wasn’t quite as good as the Pixel 2 XL at preserving fine detail and minimising blur, but it was fairly close.. The camera was also capable of producing excellent shots in better lighting, but the 2x “clear zoom” wasn’t very good, particularly on an overcast day. Pictures looked fine on the phone, but viewed at full resolution on a PC the images lost their crisp detail, an unfortunate consequence of digital zoom.. Portrait mode worked well at producing the pleasingly shallow depth of field effect, but it isn’t as good as the best of rival’s implementation, coming unstuck around fine detail such as hair.. The 16-megapixel selfie camera is also very good, although it looks a little soft when viewed at full resolution. The camera app is great, with plenty of options including lots of manual control and RAW output.. The OnePlus 5T comes only in “midnight black” and costs £449 for 64GB of storage and 6GB of RAM ( buy here) or £499 for 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM.. For comparison, the 5.8in Galaxy S8 with 64GB of storage costs £689 ( buy here ), the 6.2in Galaxy S8+ with 64GB costs £779 ( buy here ), the the 6in Pixel 2 XL with 64GB costs £799 ( buy here ), the 5.5in Apple iPhone 8 Plus with 64GB costs £799 ( buy here ) and the 5.8in iPhone X with 64GB costs £999 ( buy here ).. The OnePlus 5T is a brilliant phone. The large, good-looking 6in screen corrects one of the only flaws with the previous OnePlus 5 to produce a device that is thoroughly on-trend.. Its performance is top-notch, the cameras are good, the phone feels great and there’s even a headphone socket. If that wasn’t enough the 34-hour battery life is excellent. All it is missing are wireless charging, water resistance and the latest version of Android.. It would be a really good phone costing £600, but priced at just £449 makes the OnePlus 5T an absolute bargain, offering a top-notch experience for considerably less than the competition - you could buy two 5Ts and still have £100 spare for the cost of one iPhone X.. Pros: great battery life, good screen, good build, great performance, dual-Sim, good camera, Bluetooth 5. Cons: old version of Android, no IP water resistance rating, screen only FHD+, no wireless charging, no expandable storage, questions around support.

CRITIC REVIEW OnePlus 5T review: The worthy heir apparent. In a relatively short period of time, OnePlus has steadily built a stream of loyalists. So much so that when the brand launches a new phone, there is a considerable amount of buzz and anticipation. It was no different when recently OnePlus finally took wraps off its much teased smartphone the OnePlus 5T. This is a device which boasts of many firsts -- OnePlus 5T is the first smartphone from the Chinese manufacturer to sport a bezel less display with 18:9 aspect ratio, face unlock feature and a rear mounted fingerprint sensor. That’s not all as to go with these new features, the smartphone offers all the high-end specifications, which makes it a worthy competitor to take on the other flagship smartphones available in the market. Priced on the same lines as the OnePlus 5, the smartphone promises to offer a better user experience as compared to its predecessor. We tested the OnePlus 5T for some time and here is our complete review of the device. Reduce the bezel area and position the fingerprint sensor differently in OnePlus 5 and you will find yourself holding the new OnePlus 5T. The major design difference in both the devices is the larger display and a rear mounted fingerprint sensor. The all-new OnePlus 5T comes with a seamless aluminium unibody with rounded edges, just like its predecessor. The smartphone is available in Black colour option and its rear panel comes with an anti-fingerprint coating layer which makes it smudge-free. Despite being slightly heavier than the OnePlus 5, the smartphone looks pretty sleek and its slightly contoured sides offer a firm grip to the user. One of the major design changes and the USP of the device is its bezel-less display. The OnePlus 5T features a 6.01-inch AMOLED display with 18:9 aspect ratio. The front panel of the smartphone only consists of the screen and the 16MP front camera. With this new smartphone, the company has ditched its pill shaped fingerprint sensor placed on the display. Now the rear of the device consists of a circular fingerprint senor along with dual rear camera setup and OnePlus branding. Other than this, the placement of all the buttons remains the same. The power button is located on the right with the SIM card tray, while the volume rockers are there on the left. The bottom of the smartphone is home to the USB Type C, speaker grille and the 3.5mm audio jack. We were already impressed with the design on the OnePlus 5 and we can say the same is the case with 5T. *Bezel-less display *Improved camera *Excellent performer. OnePlus 5T User Reviews & Rating.

Hi Guys, Have been using it for a little over two weeks now and I can''t get enough of it already. 😍 Here''s my take so far.#OnePlus5T#firsthandexperience Things to rave about 😉 Fastest face unlock I have ever encountered. So much so you wouldn''t even notice it happened. 😱 The processor speed at 8 GB is unreal, meaning apps opening at a pretty amazing speed and the browsing too is the speediest ever. Clicks amazing pictures during daylight with great detailing. Dash charger - charges your phone to 💯 in around an hour. The video shooting in 4k mode shoots some awesome smooth videos, which makes up for the shaky hands/just plain walking. I personally like the expanded screenshot and the three finger swipe to capture the screenshot too. 😀 Dual sim, something I missed while using iPhone. This is hands down the best specifications you can get at this value. The only thing, which I wish was better is the picture quality in low light. This is something that even the best of phones struggle with though. Portrait mode too could be better.
