HTC One M9s Debuts With MediaTek Helio X10 Octa-Core Processor. 19 November 2015, 8:51 am EST By Menchie Mendoza Tech Times. HTC just launched a new variant of its One M9 flagship, introducing the One M9s in its home country of Taiwan.. The One M9s mid-range handset is also a separate version of the One M9e smartphone the Taiwan-based company announced in China last month. The new device seems to have inherited the One M9 flagship's metal classic design, including the texture and color range.. The 5-inch 1080p HTC One M9s features. a 2.2 GHz Octa-Core MediaTek Helio X10 (MT6795T) 64-bit processor and runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. It has 16 GB internal storage that can be expanded by up to 2 TB using a microSD card. Other exciting features include a 2 GB of RAM, a pair of front-facing BoomSound stereo speakers with Dolby audio, a 2,840 mAh battery, 4G LTE connectivity, a 4-megapixel UltraPixel front camera (f/2.0 aperture, 26.8 millimeter lens), and a 13-megapixel OIS rear camera (f/2.0 aperture, 27.8 millimeter lens) that has a dual-LED and dual tone flash.. "HTC is with telecommunications partners to accelerate the promotion of pluralism [in] 4G services and tariff schemes," said. Dongjun Liang, general manager of HTC North Asia. "HTC One M9s [continues] the classic features and visual effects from [the] HTC One series of re-evolution.". The company further believes that the great price of its new One M9s will increase customer satisfaction, as HTC fans are now able to experience the company's 4G flagship phone series features on a budget.. The handset will reportedly retail at NT$12,900 ($394) across the stores in Taiwan. Compared to its older sibling, the One M9 that launched in March and was priced at $649 in the U.S. with no subsidy, the latest variant from HTC is definitely more pocket-friendly while still boasting a premium build.. Consumers can also choose from three color options available for the One M9s: silver, gold and gray.. HTC said that consumers can even get. their hands on the so-called HTC Dot View second generation protective sleeve, which they can use to provide a protective cover to their handset. With color options such as pink, gray and blue, the protective cover also allows consumers to perform basic tasks on their handset without the need to open the cover. These include checking the time, the weather and other notifications.. It remains to be seen whether the new HTC One M9s will also make it to the stores in the U.S. and in other markets, but for now it only launched in Taiwan..

This article is about the smartphone series. For other phones with this name, see HTC One .. HTC One is a series of Android and Windows Phone smartphones designed and manufactured by HTC. All products in the One series were designed to be touchscreen -based and slate -sized, and to initially run the Android mobile operating system ( Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich or subsequent Android releases) with the HTC Sense graphical user interface. The one exception to this is the HTC One (M8) , which came in a Windows Phone variant in addition to several Android variants. From 2010 to 2013, all HTC products starting from the HTC Sensation XE to the HTC One Mini were equipped with a Beats Audio equalizer. Later HTC devices beginning with the HTC One Max no longer ship with Beats Audio following the buyback of HTC's stake in Beats Electronics .. While critically acclaimed, the 2012 One series had not received much consumer attention and sales were disappointing. For one, HTC has been outspent on marketing by Samsung and Apple , as HTC instead had relied heavily on carriers to promote its products. [1] Also, while HTC made many carrier-specific devices, Samsung and Apple were able to concentrate their resources on single flagship handsets such as the Samsung Galaxy S III and iPhone 4S to attract the attention of the consumers. Lastly, while HTC handsets were seen as better quality than Samsung's plastic devices, Samsung was able to successfully distinguish itself from other Android manufacturers with manufacturer-specific software tweaks (as well as marketing to promote its brand) while HTC could not. The "One" devices released in 2012 consist of the following, with devices in similar price segments usually sold by different carriers:. The 2013 One series was reduced to focus on only three versions of one main design. Three devices had been announced as of October 2013: the HTC One (M7) in February 2013, the One Mini in July 2013, and the One Max in October 2013. Following the previous year's setbacks, the HTC One was critically acclaimed for its design, and was commercially successful.. The last flagship phone in the HTC One series was the HTC One M9 , which was announced and released in 2015. Its successor, the HTC 10 , is HTC's 2016 flagship phone; however, it did not use the "One" branding in the name. Its successor, the 2017 HTC U11 , did not use the "One" branding either.. This table is primarily intended to show the differences between the models of the One series:. 1080p HD video recording, video stabilization, slow motion video capture (768 x 432 pixels), HDR video recording.. 1080p HD video recording, video stabilization, slow motion video capture (768 x 432 pixels), HDR video recording. 1080x1920 (1080p HD) (30 fps), 1280x720 (720p HD) (60 fps) video recording, video stabilization, slow motion video capture, HDR video recording,. 1080x1920 (1080p HD) (30 fps), 1280x720 (720p HD) (60 fps) video recording, video stabilization, slow motion video capture, HDR video recording.

User ratings and reviews for HTC One M9. 4 Out of 5. 5 Star 4 Star 1 3 Star 2 Star 1 Star. Displaying review(s) 1- 1 of 1 Sort by: Most Helpful Most Recent. Owner of HTC One M9 for 3 months now. By Rebel Saint | 16 Jun 2015. I originally was searching all over going crazy, looking for a Moto X 2nd generation, then i finally decided since nobody near me had one that ill just get my second choice, then I picked the HTC One M9 after holding one and playing with it for a good 10 minutes. I am very surprised, i didn't know I was going to love this phone as much as I do.. Speakers: the frequency response could really do better. Love the sound though, but i still say "it's amazing speakers for a phone to have." But, i don't really complain all too much about it, the dual front facing speakers makes so much sense and they are quite accurate and full. The speakers don't go down below 70hz.. Hardware: This phone has the strongest GPU (as tested) out of any smartphone ever (as of June 2015) tested with 3dMark IceStorm Unlimited and scored higher than the S6 Edge. The PCMark for Android performance test for CPU (a real phone test, real time tests, no stupid lame algorithm tests) scored around 4255 and 4596 with Maximize CPU Performance option on (developer option). Reliability: This phone is indestructible, a definite plus for those accident prone smartphone users. The corning gorilla glass 4 and aluminum body keep everything intact very well. (i have not dropped my phone, (yet) i have seen many M9 drop tests on youtube) Haven't noticed any performance drops or slowing, still as fast as it was the day I got it. I've never had problems with this phone yet.. Screen: Touch response i found to be below 35ms (which is better than most phones and very fast and sleek) the 1920x1080p display is quite enough for a good display, and strikingly beautiful, even though the thing to have now it those 1440x2560 phones like in the S6. i held the two phones next to eachother and didnt see a difference in resolution. the blacks are dark and the whites are bright, and the colors look beautiful.. Design: A definite beauty of a phone, a one of a kind look. Definitely a very mature looking phone, kind of like a Rolex watch, but in the phone world. Camera: The camera isnt that good when you pull the M9 out of the box, you will need to tweak some camera settings, then you will find the cameras on both sides to be quite phenomenal.. Overall speed: Hardware specs and more ram doesn't always ensure the fastest speeds. The weight of the software, the display, the battery, GPU, CPU and much more come into play when it comes to a phone's true speed. The phone can carry it's own weight (as in it doesn't stutter or lag or load to do simple functions that the phone is meant to do) only sometimes it stutters, not enough to be a problem. web browsing is quite fast and snappy, and gaming... playing games is great on that phone. The phone i think was built more for gaming since it packs a stronger gpu than most other phones.. Wrap-Up: This phone is plenty enough to keep me happy, and I am very surprised at what this phone can do, and all of it's fancy features are amazing. but i still find myself dreaming about getting another Moto X someday, Dreams will be dreams though, i have an HTC One M9, a very good phone that i am in love with. it's hard to put this phone down, and i find myself staring at this phone's aluminum back, a gorgeous phone..
