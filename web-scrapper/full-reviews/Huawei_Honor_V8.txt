First, phone is beautiful,well built, fast really fast, awesome camera amazing,delivery was super fast (2 days?) ,excellent seller. I highly recommend it, I had two Huaweis before ,but this one is great.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars It is beautiful and good.. I was very amazed by the phone. The battery last long,the system worked fluence, also the stability is good. I haven't experienced any stuck problem, I only used it like a month when I was in China, now I am completely in Huawei. I personally would say if iPhone 7 was the same price as this I would by iPhone, but if it is the same price as Samsung note 7 (if it wasnt have the exploding problem) I would still buy v8. Very good price for this quality!. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Four Stars.

The V8 is Huawei's flagship in the Honor series of devices. Consumers can choose from different display and processor options but the camera module is the same on all variants. The Honor V8 features a dual-camera setup that looks very similar in terms of specifications to the one found on the Huawei P9, but has to make do without the P9's Leica branding.. Both 12MP sensors are coupled with a 6-element lens with F2.2 aperture. There is also a dual-LED flash and the AF-system is laser-assisted. As on the P9, the front camera offers an 8MP sensor and F2.4 aperture. In terms of display resolution customers get to choose from Full-HD or Quad-HD but all displays measure 5.7-inches and come with 2.5HD curved glass. The Android 6.0 operating system with Huawei EMUI 4.1 skin is powered by an octa-Core Kirin 950 or 955 chipset. RAM is 4GB on all models but the model with the higher-resolution screen comes with 64GB of storage while the Full-HD variant has to make do with 32GB..

Huawei Honor v8 vs Huawei P9 First let’s look at the design of both the handsets. Surprisingly, Huawei decided to use the same design as the Huawei P9 series on the new Honor V8 as well. While companies try to differentiate two different series with its own unique design, it looks like Huawei felt that both the phones should have the same design, which in my opinion looks pretty good. But if you had to differentiate between the two models, you would find the fingerprint sensor at the back to be slightly different. And of course, the logos are different, with the P9 coming with ‘Huawei’ branding while V8 coming with ‘Honor’ branding at the back. The only major difference between the two models is the Leica certification on the Huawei P9 and its absence on the V8’s dual cameras. Let’s take a look at the setup in detail. Huawei P9 vs Honor V8 Dual Cameras: Huawei P9 comes with a 12MP dual camera setup with the components being developed to meet’s Leica’s strict standards. The company reportedly collaborated with Leica to co-engineer the structure of the camera module. Plus, the phone comes with Huawei’s digital image processing. Then there are Laser Autofocus and dual tone LED flash to assist the dual cameras in photography. honor v8 vs huawei p9 dual cameras Coming to the Honor V8, even this particular device features 12MP dual camera setup. But Lecia was not involved in the development of V8’s dual camera module. But the basic idea remains the same as the P9’s setup. The phone features 1 RGB sensor which collects colour information and another black and white sensor. These two work together to take pictures. The module supports depth of field, laser autofocus and larger aperture ranging from f/0.95 to f/16. As you can see, on paper, the V8’s dual cameras also looks like a powerful setup, but only when we have real camera samples from both the P9 and the V8 can we ascertain how better the P9 Leica branded camera is as compared to the V8’s setup. Since we have seen that the major difference in the camera department was the Leica branding, let’s look at what specs both phones bring to the table. Huawei P9 vs Honor V8 Specs: The Huawei P9 comes with the Kirin 955 octa-core chipset which is very capable as seen in the earlier benchmarks. There will be 4GB of RAM on board along with 64GB memory, and 1080p 5.2-inch display. On the other hand, the Huawei V8 comes with Kirin 950 (slightly under clocked) with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, 5.7-inch 2K display and NFC. However, although there are subtle differences, the flagships have similar features and designs. Aside from the different chipset and storage versions, both flagships have almost the same build and profile, as well as other features and options. Both the P9 lineup and the Honor V8 editions come in premium metal builds and have infrared, and fingerprint sensors. Being recent releases, the two flagships also come with Android Marshmallow onboard, layered with Huawei's new EMUI 4.1 platform..

Pros: It\'s surpisingly light in weight (it\'s weird !) , well design and gold color is very nice (suit perfectly for my wife). All functionalities are present as NFC, hotspot wif and so on, A new switch under the power button to assign Hivoice or other fucntionality chosen ( i prefer assign it to the flash to use as flashlight). Playstore is installed and OTA update is activated afetr opening the phone. Update successively to Android 7.0 (Nougat : Bulid KNT-AL10C00B377 with EMUI 5.0). New feature available to enable or disable application to prevent them to start a boot, so it\'s so cool to optimize battery and CPU usage and RAM (normally i need to root the phone to have this function, so now i don\'t need to root the phone anymore). We can reduce display resolution to 720P to save battery if needed. With EMUI we can choose to have Apps tray or not (i prefer with apps tray). In extreme sunlight, the very bright display is excellent.GPS and Bluetooth are great, no disconnection noticed.4GB of RAM is so cool (i think i can\'t go back with phones under this amount). Some chinese apps remain and i unstillalled most of them. Some cannot be unstalled, i disabled them (cool function present in the OS). The battery is top for 3500Mah, it perform verry, very well ( more than 1,5 days in normal usage) and is quick charge.Sincerelly, i was afraid about the batery because i used to have 4000mah in my phones since now but i\'m now at ease even with 3450mah. Sound is good but not exceptional as distorsion is noticed in maximum volume (The speaker of leagoo M8 or M8 pro is much better , but Leagoo is much better than ANY phone i had that i can say Leagoo is exceptional!!!). Cameras are a massaccre ! In daylight, it\'s perfect as fast focus and colors are accurate, nice. In artificial light, it\'s excellent (that what i need). In low light it is too good as focus works well , with good result. Pro mode is a massacre to play with aperture speed and so on...This camera phone is more than enough to replace occasionally my Panasonic LX7 with aperture f 1.4 that i use in low light when needed. I would recommand this phone to whom who can afford the price. In summary, this phone is a succes for it\'s price. Cameras are top range category especially in low light and artificial light with fast focus. Battery is more than sufficent to more and day use... Cons: In charging, if play game at same time, i can feel the phone warm near the finger print sensor, but not hot. I was afraid about this detail but it\'s ok. I have to use and backup software to restore my contacts. i had problem to set email like yahoo or Gmail (don\'t know why) so i use Gmail app and Yahoo mail app instead.. Is this helpful? Yes ( 0 ) No ( 0 ). Pros: Esse celular é uma máquina, aproveitei a promoção e não mim arrependo, sensor de digitais não erra uma, duração da bateria ta boa, recomendo sem duvidas Cons: Nada.

Sony Xperia XZ2 embraces curves, haptics and 4K HDR. Galaxy S9 price details: Verizon, T-Mobile, unlocked, more [Updated]. Huawei MateBook X Pro hides pop-up webcam in svelte 3k laptop. How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. Huawei honor v8 puts a lot of focus on its dual camera. JC Torres - May 11, 2016. Huawei ‘s Honor sub-brand may not exactly be known, especially in the West, for premium grade smartphones, but it is changing that perception with the newly unveiled honor V8. For one, it flaunts some of the highest specs you’d see in an early 2016 flagship. Yes, including at least one variant with a QHD screen. But not only that, it takes after its more high profile Huawei P9 cousin when it comes to cameras. In fact, it seems to use the same dual cameras, with an added trick of its own.. While dual lens cameras on smartphones isn’t exactly new, the Huawei P9 put a different spin on the still uncommon trend. It paired a regular colored sensor with a monochrome sensor, the latter more concerned about capturing depth information in order to increase the detail and quality of the resulting images. The honor V8 inherits that feature, in fact the same 12 megapixel 1.25 micropixel sensor it seems. Interestingly, it makes no mention of Leica this time. On the front is also an 8 megapixel camera, similar to the Huawei P9 as well.. In addition to improvements in image quality, honor is also advertising a new feature that takes advantage of the dual cameras. It calls it “3D Dynamic Panorama”, it is as it sounds. Or perhaps “reverse panorama” might be more appropriate. Whereas regular panoramas let you take sweeping images of a scene, this feature, instead, almost literally revolves around a single object, usually a person. You basically try to walk around a person/object to take a 360-degree shot, even with the subject moving a bit. The result is almost like an animated GIF that you can swipe left and right like scrubbing through a video. The dual cameras properly capture depth information so you end up with something like a parallax effect, with the background moving/panning slower than the foreground.. The result is perhaps best seen in action on this sample page .. The smartphone’s specs aren’t exactly shabby either. Inside is either a Kirin 950 or 955, Huawei’s octa-core CPU clocked at 2.3 GHz or 2.5 GHz, respectively. All available configurations immediately start with 4 GB of RAM, which is definitely the highest sane offering this year. Internal storage choices include 32 or 64 GB, with an expansion option via a SIM and microSD card tray combo. The honor v8 has a 5.7-inch screen with either 1920×1080 FHD or 2560×1440 WQHD resolutions, depending on the model. Battery is rated at 3,500 mAh, which is still on the large side. The device runs Android 6.0 and Huawei’s EMUI 4.1 custom experience.. Despite those high end specs, the honor V8 isn’t going for a high end price. The KNT-AL10 configuration, which has the Kirin 950, FHD screen, and 32 GB of storage, goes for 2,499 RMB, roughly $385. The KNT-AL20 which bumps things up to Kirin 955, WQHD resolution, and 64 GB of storage, isn’t that much higher at 2,799 RMB, or $430. Those are usually mid-range prices from other OEMs.. The launch of the honor V8 also coincides with Huawei’s foray into the virtual reality space with an Honor VR headset of its own. But in case you’re not that yet sold on VR, you won’t have to worry about buying a headset just to test it out. Fortunately, honor’s box for the honor V8 actually transforms into a Google Cardboard headest for your viewing pleasure.. – OS: Android 6.0 Marshmallow (Huawei EMUI 4.1). – Size: 157 x 77.6 x 7.75 mm. – Display: 5.7″ FHD LCD 386ppi (KNT-AL10) / 5.7″ WQHD LCD 515ppi (KNT-AL20). – Processor: Huawei Kirin 950 (KNT-AL10) / Kirin 955 (KNT-AL20). – Internal Storage: 32GB (KNT-AL10) / 64GB (KNT-AL20). – Camera (rear): Dual 12MP (F2.2). – Connectivity: WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac (2.4/5GHz), Bluetooth v4.2 LE, NFC, IR blaster. – IP rating: IP68 water and dust resistrance.

The Honor V8’s dual-lens camera is different from the Huawei P9’s in one important way. Big 5.7-inch screen Honor’s new fitness tracker really does look fantastic No, Huawei hasn’t forgotten about the P9 Lite, as rumors of the phone continue How to use the Huawei P9’s superb dual-lens camera. Huawei has been dropping huge hints regarding its next smartphone to wear the Honor brand name for several weeks, and now it’s here. It’s the Honor V8 , and like the. Huawei P9 , it also has a dual-lens camera setup on the rear. However, it’s also quite a lot larger than the P9, and even the 5.5-inch P9 Plus. Here’s everything you need to know about it.. There’s another difference, because the Honor V8’s camera doesn’t have Leica branding, meaning it’s lacking the camera company’s input into the software, tuning, and lens development. It’s impossible to say how this will affect picture quality without testing the phone, but Honor has added at least one new feature to make up for the lack of Leica’s name on the 12-megapixel cameras.. Related: Our review of the superb Huawei P9. While the adjustable depth-of-field mode seen on the P9 is still present, the Honor V8 has a cool 3D picture mode, where unusual, almost GIF-style photos can be taken. Honor has some examples on its website here , where the views can be explored by clicking and dragging the photo left or right. It’s not 360 degrees, it’s more like a panoramic image but with a tighter viewpoint.. To make it easier and more immersive to view these ultra-wide, scrolling pictures, Honor has made. a Google Cardboard-style viewer that doubles as the box in which a product is sold. It’s an unusual approach we’ve not seen before, but it’s not that clear from the launch event whether the VR box will be sold separately, or if the V8 will come packaged inside one.. The camera is accompanied by a dual-tone LED flash, laser autofocus, and it has an f2.2 aperture just like the P9.. Moving on to the size of the V8. It has a 5.7-inch screen, larger than both the P9 and P9 Plus, and there is a choice of either a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution model, or one with a 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution. Which ever you choose, it’ll be wrapped in a 2.5D piece of curved glass, and a similar shaped 7.7mm thick metal body. If you just want the 1080p model, it comes with a Kirin 950 octa-core processor and 4GB of RAM, plus 32GB of storage space. The 1440p model has the Kirin 955 octa-core chip seen in the P9, also with 4GB of RAM, but an additional 32GB of storage, taking the total to 64GB.. The V8 has dual-SIM card support with the option of using a MicroSD card in the second slot, a fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone, a 3,500mAh battery with USB-Type-C fast charging, and an 8-megapixel selfie camera. Android 6.0 Marshmallow is the operating system, covered with Huawei’s own EMUI user interface. There are six colors to choose from, including white and rose gold, with prices starting at around $350 for the 1080p model to $430 for the higher-specced model with the 1440p screen.. If you’re not familiar with the Honor brand name, it’s a spin-off of Huawei, offering fun, funky, and competitively priced smartphones for the younger generation. It’s a global brand, and launched in the U.S. earlier this year with the Honor 5X , a close relation to Huawei’s Honor 7. The Honor V8 has only been announced in China for now, but there’s a chance it’ll be sold elsewhere in the future.

Huawei Honor V8 Max apparently incoming too with 6.6-inch screen, 4,400 mAh battery. Adrian Diaconescu July 4, 2016 7:07 am. One of the busiest bees in the Chinese if not global smartphone landscape has flooded the market lately with various models ranging from ultra-low-cost and low-end to mid-range to premium , still cooking up a high-end (-ish) Honor 8 , as well as Note 7-rivaling Mate S and Mate 8 sequels .. You can also add a jumbo-sized Kirin 950 powerhouse to the list of upcoming Huawei devices now, which Tenaa refers to by a cryptic EDI-DL00 model number. There’s every reason to believe this big guy will have a very close family connection to the Honor V8 (emphasize on V), likely adjoining a Max or Plus suffix to the name.. Probably Max, though, given the 6.6-inch display in tow here, with Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440 pixels) resolution, which sounds like quite the energy hog. Then again, the purported Huawei Honor V8 Max should squeeze a fittingly huge 4,400 mAh cell inside a 219-gram, 7.2mm-thin package, so the phablet is able to get you through the day sans hugging a wall.. What’s interesting (read bizarre) is the V8 Max looks to settle for just one humdrum 13MP rear-facing camera, paired with an 8-megapixel selfie snapper, plus 3 instead of 4GB RAM, and 32GB expandable storage..

Adrian has had an insatiable passion for writing since he was in school and found himself writing philosophical essays about the meaning of life and the differences between light and dark beer. Later, he realized this was pretty much his only marketable skill, so he first created a personal blog (in Romanian) and then discovered his true calling, which is writing about all things tech (in English)..
