CRITIC REVIEW Xiaomi Redmi 5A review: Bang for your bucks. Xiaomi’s Redmi 4 and Redmi 4A have been a big shot in the arm for the Chinese brand in India. Both devices have done very well and it came as no surprise when the huge success of the Xiaomi Redmi 4A compelled the company to launch Redmi 5A. The company claimed that it sold about eight million units of the smartphone and in order to oblige its customers the company will be giving a discount of Rs 1,000 on first five million units of Redmi 5A. So, at the price of Rs 4,999, the smartphone becomes quite a good deal. The device offers a metal body design and comes with three card slots which are not found in many smartphones. We played around with the entry-level smartphone for a few days, and here's the rest of our review. Design and Display There is nothing extraordinary about the looks of Xiaomi Redmi 5A. The smartphone comes with a metallic design unlike its predecessor the Redmi 4A which came with a plastic body. The smartphone looks like any other entry level device. The matte finished metallic rear panel consists of the 13MP rear camera with LED flash and a Xiaomi branding. The bottom of the back panel also has the speaker grille. The smartphone doesn’t come with a fingerprint sensor just like the Redmi 4A, which can be a turn off for many as brands are slowly integrating it in lesser-priced device as well. Other than this, like all Xiaomi smartphones this one also comes with an infrared sensor located on the top along with the 3.5mm audio jack. The other interesting feature of the device is the card slots. The smartphone comes with three card slots, this means that the users can use two SIM card and one microSD card at the same time. All the card slots are placed on the right side of the device. The left side offers the volume rockers and the power buttons. The front of the device is dominated by a 5-inch HD display, 5MP selfie camera and three capacitive keys placed on the bottom. *Good built quality *Triple card slots *Decent performance.

Jamshed Avari , 07 December 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Xiaomi Redmi 5A will be sold at Rs. It is virtually identical to the Redmi 4A in terms of specifications. Battery life is good, but camera quality is only just about acceptable. Xiaomi Redmi 5A design Xiaomi Redmi 5A specifications and software Xiaomi Redmi 5A performance, cameras, and battery life. Xiaomi has been crowding the budget smartphone market with multiple models and variants at overlapping price points, all with impressive specifications that the competition has struggled to match. At the lowest end, the Redmi 4A ( Review ) has been a compelling phone ever since its launch in India eight months ago , and we have recommended it to anyone on a water-tight budget. Now, Xiaomi is replacing its entry-level Redmi 4A with the Redmi 5A and making a really big deal about this launch even though there's very little difference between the two models .. In a sea of patriotically named phones such as Micromax's Bharat line and the Karbonn A40 Indian ( Review ), Xiaomi is positioning the Redmi 5A as a desh ka smartphone. What exactly qualifies it for that title is unclear - it might be its low price, the fact that it's made in India, or its promise of exceptional battery life. Perhaps the most interesting thing about this launch is Xiaomi's limited-time Rs. 1,000 discount on the lower-end model, which brings the price down to a very tempting Rs. We're curious to see what exactly has changed, and what buyers stand to gain. There isn't much to say about the Redmi 5A's looks if you've used any entry-level Android smartphone over the past year or two. It's all plastic, though the rear has a slightly metallic finish. Xiaomi says it will be sold in Dark Grey, Gold, and Rose Gold, though only the first two are listed as options for the first sale. Our Gold unit had a white front face, and we feel that the Dark Grey option with a black front would be more to our tastes.. The Redmi 5A has a 5-inch screen and there's quite a lot of plastic above and below it. Still, it's well suited to one-handed use. Grip is pretty good despite the 8.35mm thickness, and weight is quite manageable at 137g. When compared to the Redmi 4A, the differences are purely cosmetic. The two models vary by less than 1mm in terms of height and width.. There are capacitive navigation buttons below the screen which aren't backlit, but that's only to be expected at this price level. In a familiar Xiaomi touch, there's a status indicator right below the Home button which is completely invisible until it lights up when you're charging the phone.. The power and volume buttons are on the right, and there are two trays on the left - one for a single Nano-SIM, and another for a microSD card as well as another SIM. The camera at the back has a single-LED flash next to it, and the phone's speaker grille runs along the entire lower back. There's a Micro-USB port on the bottom and a 3.5mm audio socket on the top. One interesting touch is the presence of an IR emitter on the top, which you can use to control household appliances.. You get a charger and a Micro-USB cable in the box, but as usual, no headset. Interestingly, the company seems to be moving towards using Redmi as more than just a name for one product line - the box screams "Redmi 5A" on the front, sides and back, while the Xiaomi name and logo are much smaller and are almost tucked away out of sight.. It's a bit surprising that the Redmi 5A's specifications are pretty much identical to those of the Redmi 4A, which it replaces. You get the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processor, with four cores clocked at 1.4GHz. The screen measures 5 inches diagonally and has a resolution of 720x1280. There's a 13-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front camera. Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, FM radio, and GPS are supported. You can choose between a base variant with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, and a more expensive one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.. The changes, if you can even spot them, are extremely subtle. The Redmi 5A actually has a slightly smaller battery, at 3000mAh down from 3120mAh. It also has a dedicated microSD card slot rather than the Redmi 4A's hybrid dual-SIM arrangement. It uses Nano-SIMs rather than Micro-SIMS, and the maximum supported microSD capacity has gone up from 128GB to 256GB. That's pretty much it - one feature that's slightly worse, and one that's a bit better.. Unsurprisingly, with the exception of the IR emitter, the Redmi 5A has no extras compared to its predecessor. Rather than spotlighting one particular feature such as a fingerprint reader, a front flash, a huge battery, secondary rear camera or an 18:9 screen, Xiaomi has chosen to stick with pushing out a workhorse all-rounder at this price level.. At least things are a bit fresher on the software side. Xiaomi ships the Redmi 5A with Android 7.1.2, and version 9 of its custom MIUI skin running on top. This is single-layered UI with no way to enable an app drawer, which might not be a bad thing for first-time Android users. We noticed a few unnecessary animations on the home screen icons and when scrolling through long lists. There are a few themes you can choose from and hundreds more that you can download through the Themes app. You can also download individual wallpapers, fonts, and ringtones. These all appear to be free for now, but Xiaomi could start making money off downloads like this in the future.. If you dig through the Settings app, you'll find options for splitting the quick toggles out into a separate panel within the notifications shade; configuring a "Second Space" user profile for privacy; setting up gesture shortcuts; and assigning extra functions to the Android navigation keys. There's also Dual Apps functionality which lets you run a second instance of any app for use with a second account; and App Lock which lets you restrict app access - since there's no fingerprint reader, you have to use an unlock pattern to use this feature.. Xiaomi preloads a few Microsoft Office apps, Skype Lite, Amazon Shopping, WPS Office, and UC news. There's a spammy ticker of "Promoted apps" within an ordinary-looking home screen folder to encourage you to download them. Other Xiaomi features include the Mi Apps app store, Mi Store for Xiaomi products, Mi Community forum app, Mi Drop (an Apple AirDrop clone), and assorted custom apps that replace the default Android ones.. As far as entry-level phones go, Xiaomi has done well in balancing cost and performance. The Redmi 5A is capable of handling everyday tasks such as Web browsing, social apps, and messaging. We were even able to play a few heavy games, though performance wasn’t perfectly smooth. There was usually less than 500MB of free RAM out of our review unit's 2GB. We found the phone stuttering slightly when switching apps sometimes, but only really struggling when we ran heavy tests or games. Things also definitely took a turn for the worse with the Second Space feature enabled.. We got 36,421 in AnTuTu; 683 and 1,887 in Geekbench 4's single-core and multi-core tests respectively; 3,719 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme; and 14fps in GFXBench. Our test phone was the variant with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage - it stands to reason that the more expensive variant's additional RAM will make performance smoother.. The screen is pretty sharp, and even fine text looks good. Viewing angles are great, and brightness is high enough for outdoor use. However, colours don't really pop and we found that videos and games looked a bit dull. Although the speaker grille runs across the back of the phone, there's only one spot that sound actually comes out of, and the Redmi 5A is muffled easily when lying face-up on a soft surface such as a bed. Sound is pretty weak and distorts badly at high volumes.. If you swipe to the right from the Redmi 5A's lock screen, you'll see a menu with shortcuts to the Mi Remote app and something called Mi Home. The remote app is basic and unfortunately the process of figuring out how to control your TVs and other appliances requires some trial and error. There are IR profiles for Indian TV, set-top box, and AC brands including private-label store brands. Unlike with some other low-end phones, third-party apps can use the IR emitter.. The Redmi 5A's cameras are quite mediocre, but once again we have to balance our expectations against this phone's low price. Photos don't have a lot of detail - objects often have fuzzy borders, and textures aren't reproduced very well. We found that colours were pretty dull, and not just when checking photos on the phone's own screen. We were able to take some decent close-ups but anything at a distance suffered. At night, there was a serious drop in quality, and it was hard to capture anything that didn't have artificial light falling directly on it. On the plus side, autofocus was usually quick to lock during the daytime. Video recording goes up to 1080p, but we found that clips looked quite artificial and weren't very smooth.. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi 5A camera samples. The front camera applies pretty aggressive beautification by default, making faces look extremely artificial. There's a Pro beauty mode and a Smart beauty mode, the difference being that Pro mode gives you individual "Slim" and "Skin" sliders while Smart tries to guess your age and gender. When disabled, it's clear that the front camera is pretty weak.. The camera app isn't very well laid out, for example it takes two taps to get to the options menu from the default mode, but in some modes you can't get to it at all.. Xiaomi has boasted about the Redmi 5A's battery life as part of its "desh ka smartphone" pitch, and we were pleased to note that we could in fact get through a full day of casual use with up to 20 percent left over. Our HD video loop test went on for 11 hours, 9 minutes which is quite impressive.. Verdict Xiaomi continues to impress us with its low prices, and even though the Redmi 5A doesn't give us anything new or different compared to the Redmi 4A, it still delivers excellent value. If you can grab the 2GB/16GB version at the introductory offer price of Rs. Even at its regular retail price of Rs. 5,999, there aren't many phones that could compete with it. If you're a first-time smartphone user, or are only concerned with basic communications, the Redmi 5A would be quite a good choice. Camera quality is really the only major downside, and if that's important to you, you'll have to spend a bit more.. For the same reasons, the 3GB/32GB version of the Redmi 5A is less compelling. There are other options to consider that let you trade the additional RAM and storage for features such as a larger screen and fingerprint reader, most notably Xiaomi's own Redmi 4 ( Review ) and Redmi Y1 Lite. We're also not too far from the launch of the Redmi 5 with its fashionable 18:9 display , though that model is likely to cost a little more.. Is Xiaomi Redmi 5A truly 'desh ka smartphone'?

The brand recently trumped Samsung to be on the top of the smartphone sales list , based on data gathered from the top 50 cities of the country. But that certainly has not slowed down the pace at which the brand has been introducing smartphones in the sub-Rs 10,000 segment.. Redmi 5A is Xiaomi's entry-level smartphone and the successor to the Redmi 4A. While the sub-Rs 10,000 price segment has been Xiaomi's stronghold, the company dared to reduce the price of its entry-level offering, the Redmi 5A down to just under Rs 5,000 this time. While that may not sound like a massive cut, but in the entry-level space, it could be just the right price for feature phone users to jump ship to smartphones. Xiaomi is calling this 'Desh ka Smartphone' and the price point ends to justify it to some extent.. The best thing about the device is its good build quality, a decent overall feature set and bundled software at the Rs 4,999 price point. Battery life seems to be disappointing, when compared with its predecessor, but that is something that can be optimised in future updates. days worth on regular usage, but since the Redmi 4A gave almost a day and half of battery life, the expectations from the 5A will also be to match that.. When we reviewed Xiaomi’s previous entry-level Redmi 4A , back in April, we concluded that it was ‘one of the best entry-level smartphones’ in the market at the time. Here's why I think that the Redmi 5A will set the bar for entry-level smartphones in the coming year.. Very much like the Redmi 4A, their's not much at fault with Xiaomi's preference for polycarbonate in the Redmi 5A. The 5A comes in a little heavier than its predecessor though at 137 grams. Overall, the phone feels light, grippy and sturdy to hold as well.. The Xiaomi Redmi 5A does not feature a 2.5D curve on the glass seen on more premium Xiaomi smartphones. The design here almost resembles its predecessor with the placement of the backward-firing speakers being one of the few changes. The front looks almost identical and unlike Xiaomi's other devices, theirs no 2.5D glass on its entry-level smartphone. That does not hamper usability in any way.. The volume rocker and power button placement is on the right-hand side and provide the right amount of feedback while also being adequately clicky. The left-hand side sees a rather odd hybrid SIM card tray along with another regular single-SIM tray on top. The Redmi 5A comes with a thickness of 8.4 mm and a width of 70.1 mm.. The back of the smartphone resembles its predecessor except that the speaker grille is now lower than earlier. There's not much that stands apart when compared with the Redmi 4A here. The camera on the back has a metallic ring around it and the back has been curved towards the sides to assist with the grip. The top houses the 3.5 mm headphone jack and an IR blaster, while the bottom has a micro USB port for charging and data transfer.. The Xiaomi Redmi 5A comes with a 5-inch HD display and houses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 SoC with a quad-core Cortex A53 processor clocked at 1.4 GHz. The graphics department is handled by an Adreno 308 GPU. The use of a Qualcomm chipset at this price is a notable inclusion since a majority of entry-level devices pack lower-end MediaTek chipsets which is a major trade-off in performance in most cases.. The button placement is familiar with the power button and volume rockers on the right side and the SIM trays on the left. The chipset is paired with 2 GB RAM and comes with 16 GB of storage. While this is based on the device we were reviewing, there is also a 32 GB storage variant with 3 GB RAM alongside the base variant. The Redmi 5A comes with 8.58 GB of usable space at first boot and can be expanded up to 256 GB using the dedicated microSD card slot.. On the camera end, you get a 13 MP rear camera, along with a 5 MP selfie camera. All this is powered by a non-removable 3,000 mAh Li-ion battery.. The speaker output on the Redmi 5A is poor and the speaker itself is easily blocked because of its placement on the back. The Redmi 5A comes in a hybrid dual SIM slot (micro SIM + nano SIM) as well as an added separate micro SIM slot which was absent in the Redmi 4A. The phone supports Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS with A-GPS, GLONASS and BDS. It comes with a micro USB port for charging and data transfer but there is no support for fast charging.. Xiaomi has also thrown on an FM Radio and an IR blaster which are both small yet notable additions.. On paper, Xiaomi has packed the Redmi 5A with exactly the same display as its predecessor. This means that we get a 5-inch HD IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels and a pixel density of 296 PPI.. The Redmi 5A features a 5-inch HD IPS LCD display with good colour saturation and wide viewing angles. The display here is adequately bright with no issues in terms of viewing angles or viewing it under bright conditions. There is no visible shift in colour tones while viewing the phone at acute angles but brightness levels do see a minimal dip.. One thing to note here though is the adaptive brightness which has been pretty poorly implemented on the phone. The ambient light sensor failed to read the lighting in most conditions and also renders the brightness slider almost unusable when it requires manual intervention.. On the bottom we get a micro USB port for charging and data transfers. Colour reproduction was on point and watching videos or viewing social media posts should be a pleasing experience. Sharpness levels are also not an issue which could be attributed to the smaller size of the display. Overall, I had little to no qualms about the display apart from the adaptive brightness issue which forced me to turn it off after a few days.. I reviewed the Redmi Y1 before this which happened to give me a heads-up (although beta) on MIUI 9 with all of Xiaomi's claims of a much faster overall experience. While that was on a smartphone priced considerably higher, it was surprising to see Xiaomi pack in MIUI 9, even with their entry-level smartphone in such a short time.. The Xiaomi Redmi 5A runs a Global stable build of MIUI 9, based on Android Nougat 7.1.2. The Redmi 5A comes with a global, stable build of MIUI 9 which runs on Android Nougat 7.1.2. I was not being too optimistic about Android Oreo arriving anytime soon, knowing Xiaomi's usual timeline of updates, but I did expect the phone's Android Security patch to be updated. Now I did receive two minor software updates while reviewing the phone, but that did not bring any noticeable optimisations to the user experience or an update to the Android Security patch.. MIUI 9 on the Redmi 5A was a bit of a hit and miss at times in my experience as software can only be as good as the hardware components inside the smartphone. Animations were zippy, the themes looked tidier and there were no stutters in regular UI elements. The OnePlus-like widget drawer that was spotted on the Redmi Y1 was also absent here.. MIUI 9 on the Redmi 5A is fast and breaks away from the dull design language of MIUI 8.. The problems with the software though were more performance related. There were several instances when the animations were snappy but the Snapdragon 425 inside just would not have the app fired up on time, forcing the user to wait for the app to load. While this was not too bad with regular chat applications like Telegram and WhatsApp, the wait times were noticeably long with apps such as Facebook and Twitter.. Another issue that can be easily resolved through a software update is the presence of two app stores, which does make app updates unnecessarily confusing.. The Redmi 5A comes with an identical SoC and processor as its predecessor. That is not necessarily a downside by any means since the Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 is still adequate enough to deal with regular day-to-day tasks.. Morphite, a lightweight casual FPS game on the Redmi 5A.. Browsing through social media and regular video and music playback were handled with relative ease. The inclusion of just 2 GB of RAM, however, does feel like a little low in late 2017. But then one also has to keep an eye on the price here. Multitasking between two applications was alright but attempting to switch between more than two or three applications immediately caused apps to reload and also freeze for a second or two more than expected. Being an entry-level device which caters to mostly first-time smartphone users, there. is not much to find fault with the performance of the device.. In terms of gaming performance, the Snapdragon 425 and Adreno 308 GPU do fine when it comes to less intensive games like Angry Birds: Star Wars (getting my share of the Star Wars frenzy),. Morphite and Clash Royale. More heavy games like Modern Warfare and Asphalt 8: Airborne did show a low of frame drops when played in medium settings. This was expected but given the phone's price tag, there can be absolutely no complaints here.. Xiaomi Redmi 5A Benchmark Comparison Infogram. For benchmark scores, it performed as expected, with scores being neck-to-neck with the Redmi 4A. Call quality was excellent but you would not want to take calls on loudspeaker which does get tinny and is also not adequately loud. I'd pick a bottom firing speaker over a backwards-firing one any day since leaving the phone on any flat surface would result in missed calls and notification alerts. Camera: 6/10 The Xiaomi Redmi 5A comes with a 13 MP rear camera with a f/2.2 aperture and a 5 MP front-facing camera with an aperture of f/2.0. There is no change in the camera interface and is intuitive from the word go. The 5A gets phase-detection autofocus which does help slightly with focusing speeds. There are plenty of filters to choose from with some interesting ones like mirror, fish-eye, etc which are different than the regular colour filters on most smartphones. The manual mode here only lets you adjust white balance and ISO but is certainly advisable in low light where the auto mode fails to get the job done. In terms of video, you only get the time-lapse mode and no slow motion recording. In terms of image quality, the rear camera does a good job in getting the colour right. There is a decent amount of post-processing saturation boosting which does well. For sharing on social media websites, the images are good enough. The HDR mode when on takes a couple of seconds to process the image but does result in few shadows.. Also, over processing of images is noticeable in low light conditions, thereby giving them an odd plasticky feeling. Shooting in low-light is a challenge and the Redmi 5A is not really able to handle it well. The only downside is the front camera which produces soft images in even reasonably well-lit conditions.. If there is one area where you can pick faults with the Redmi 5A, then that has to be battery life. Xiaomi cut on the capacity this time round to 3000 mAh from the previous 3120 mAh. While that may not be much on paper, in real-time usage, the 5A got nowhere close to how efficient the battery on the 4A was.. It did last me up to a day of normal use with about 13-15 percent of battery left, this was with 4G LTE on throughout. On a typical day, I charged the Redmi 5A at 8 am in the morning and the phone lasted me till 8 am the following day with the said battery percentage. In terms of charging time, it took the phone about an hour and twenty minutes to charge beyond the 85 percent mark which is the point at which I usually found myself disconnecting the phone from the charger.. On days with heavier usage with prolonged gaming sessions and Netflix viewing, I found myself looking for the charger within 8-9 hours approximately. We also ran PC Mark's Work Performance 2.0 which returned with just 7 hours and 29 minutes which is well below par, considering the Redmi 4A has managed more than 12 hours on the same test. The battery performance could be a MIUI 9 optimisation problem since it's still new, but it is certainly an area that Xiaomi should improve upon.. The Xiaomi Redmi 5A is a steal at its introductory price tag of Rs 4,999 for the first 5 million buyers. The regular price is Rs 5,999. Its predecessor which was a true value for money purchase with a price tag of Rs 5,999, set a bar for entry-level devices in 2017 and the 5A only raises the bar, if you overlook the battery life. Considering its introduction in December, the Redmi 5A should easily be the phone to beat for any new entry-level smartphone in 2018.. In summation, the Redmi 5A manages to check all the boxes, a first-time smartphone adopter could wish for. The phone packs a sturdy build, a good display, an able processor and GPU combination as well as a good rear camera in good lighting conditions. The formula for making a good overall package at enticing price points. This has also held it in good stead in the fast-evolving smartphone market in India. The only section where it failed to better its predecessor was in the battery life department, which could be improved on with better software optimisation.. Xiaomi Redmi 5A comes with a 13 MP f/2.2 rear camera which includes phase-detection autofocus. If you have made it this far in the review, everything must be sounding too good to be true. However, the biggest problem with getting your hands on Xiaomi’s entry-level phone is the dreaded flash sale that every potential buyer of the Redmi 5A has to be accustomed to. We have mentioned this in our earlier reviews as well but Xiaomi seems to stick with the old system of flash sales which has been a kick in its heels for a while now. The company did mention that it would make the smartphone available on its Mi Home offline chain as well as other partner stores in time but will it be able to keep production numbers up is something only time will tell.. Nonetheless, in terms of being the best phone in its price segment and one without any competition in its radar, the Redmi 5A is surely a phone to consider if you are a feature phone user planning to advance to a smartphone. It even makes for a good secondary phone if you already have a higher end device.. The Xiaomi Redmi 5A (16GB, 2GB RAM) features a 5.0-inch HD IPS display with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels and is powered by a 1.4GHz quad core processor and has 2GB of RAM. It comes with 16GB of inbuilt storage, expandable upto 128GB and has a 13.0-megapixel rear camera and 5.0-megapixel front camera. It comes with Android 7.1 Nougat OS and support a 3000mAh battery capacity with 3G & 4G..

Xiaomi Mi Mix 2s to feature Snapdragon 845 SoC, launch set for March. 27 Microsoft, Xiaomi to make AI-powered speakers,. smartphones Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro gets Face Unlock with latest OTA. Xiaomi is doing very well in India, even better than the company’s own expectations. For a brand that came into the market only three years ago to outrank well entrenched rivals like Samsung is no small feat. Sales of its Redmi Note 4, as well as the Redmi 4 have helped the company become a household brand.. It’s not just the affordable price of the Redmi 4A that made the phone so admirable in the market. Steady performance coupled with excellent cameras have helped the Redmi 4A to raise the bar. But the success of the Redmi 4A is such that the company thought of launching its sequel in the same year itself: the Redmi 5A. While the Redmi 5A might not be totally different from the Redmi 4A, it does offer small improvements. You will be able to pick up the Redmi 5A for a starting price of Rs 4,999. on December 7 at 12:00PM via Flipkart and Mi.com/in.. Here is our review of the Xiaomi Redmi 5A.. Xiaomi Redmi 5A specifications : 5-inch HD 1280 x 720 resolution display| Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processor|2GB RAM +16GB storage/3GB RAM +32GB storage|microSD card slot option (up to 128GB) |13MP rear +5MP front camera|3000mAh battery|MIUI 9.1, Android 7.1 Nougat. Xiaomi Redmi 5A price in India : Rs 4,999 (2GB RAM +16GB storage), Rs 6,999 (3GB RAM + 32GB storage). Xiaomi Redmi 5A review: Design and display. At first glance you’ll wonder what has changed, it looks pretty much the same as the Redmi 4A. If you have used the Redmi 4A, you will not see a major improvement in the design department. Its all plastic body has been jazzed up with a metal finish. My review unit came in ‘Gold’, but the phone can be purchased in several other colour options including Dark Grey and Rose Gold. Coupled with a rounded, smooth design, Redmi 5A looks and feels comfortable in your hand. To my surprise, it doesn’t feel slippery, which is a big relief. The device weighs only 137g so this device feels light compared to some of the other phones on offer in this same segment.. The Redmi 5A retains those chunky top and bottom areas of its bezel, like the Redmi 4A. And underneath the display are three capacitive buttons that are not backlit. The power button and a pair of volume rockers can be found on to the right side. The other side houses a dual sim tray and a dedicated microSD slot. There’s a standard microUSB port on the bottom of the phone and a headphone jack and an Infrared port on the top. The Infrared blaster can help users to control other devices in their home.. At the back is a single camera setup with a flash on the top-left. The mono speaker is at the bottom. The Redmi 5A doesn’t offer a fingerprint scanner for added security, unlike the Redmi 4. This is a ‘Made in India’ phone.. The Redmi 5A’s screen is the same 5-inches in size as the one on the Redmi 4A and doesn’t pack any more pixels. So essentially, it has a resolution of 1280 x 720p and a pixel density of 296 ppi. I’m totally fine with the quality of the display; images are sharp, and videos look impressive. It’s perfect for a Netflix craving. If you’re coming from a feature phone background, the Redmi 5A’s 5-inch screen will be a huge upgrade. I can’t ask for more at this price point.. Xiaomi Redmi 5A review: Hardware and software. Xiaomi Redmi 5A has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processor under its hood and it performs reasonably well. For everyday tasks the Redmi 5A shows no sign of lag. Browsing the web and running apps should be of no concern on the phone. Even with dozens of Chrome tabs open at once, the Redmi 5A never stuttered. In my testing, I loaded both Shadow Fight 3 and Sonic Forces Speed Battle to check the gaming performance on the Redmi 5A. But this device is not meant to handle heavy graphics intensive games like Real Racing 3 and Asphalt 8.. My review unit had 2GB RAM and 16GB storage. On the AnTuTu benchmark test, Redmi 5A scored 36,626. I believe the 3GB RAM (it has a built-in 32GB storage) variant might be a slightly faster in performance, but honestly, I haven’t tested that model. Though both models come with an expandable storage (up to 128GB).. In the sound department, Xiaomi Redmi 5A has cracked the code by managing to cram a mono speaker. The Redmi 5A is loud enough, even when a bunch of people around in the room. It’s not quite as bass[y), though.. Redmi 5A’s 3000mAh battery lasted close to 27 hours on a single charge. On a typical day, I make lots of calls, browse the web, check emails on a regular basis, with WhatsApp running constantly and Facebook app running in the background, watching YouTube videos while commuting to office, and streaming music through Saavn. It’s good to see that the phone’s battery lasted more than a day. I suspect if you are an average user the Redmi 5A’s battery might last close to two days.. Xiaomi Redmi 5A runs on MIUI 9, which is based on Android 7.1 Nougat. MIUI 9 brings with it a ton of big and small features, as well as typical Google features like split-screen multitasking and even Google Assistant. What I like about Xiaomi’s native MIUI is that it’s simple to operate and easy on the eyes. The phone didn’t feel sluggish, even though it is not running a pure version of Android. Xiaomi has also preloaded a slew of third-party apps like Amazon Shopping, UC News, and the Microsoft Office and Skype apps.. It’s hard to expect a great camera experience on a phone in this price segment. The Redmi 5A, however, is an exception. In fact, the camera is the most fascinating aspect of the Redmi 5A. The primary camera has a 13MP sensor with an f/2.2 aperture, along with PDAF ability. The front shooter is a 5MP one with an f/2.0 aperture with smart and beautification modes.. I tested the back camera in a number of conditions including in a bright day light. The images it produced were full of detail, sharp and the colours were just right. In very low light, it flatters though. The back camera can also record 1080p video. The recorded video looked crisp when played on my desktop.. The Redmi 5A is not targeted at those who already bought the Redmi 4A. Instead, Xiaomi says it is targeting first-time smartphone buyers, especially those who are looking to upgrade their “dumb” feature phones. At Rs 4,999, Redmi 5A is the most affordable Xiaomi smartphone in India. And it tells a lot about the company’s expectations from the Redmi 5A. When you look at the Redmi 5A, its design, specifications, 4G LTE connectivity and cameras, all this makes the phone stand out in the competition.. While less expensive than the Redmi 4, the Redmi 5A isn’t that cheap, as you can pick up the JioPhone for free and Bharat 1 for as little as Rs 2200. The latter phone even support WhatsApp and Facebook on the device. But the Redmi 5A is a complete smartphone, boasting faster performance and a superior camera, making this a phone well above the notch..

Snapdragon 425, Quad Core Cortex-A53, 4x 1.4GHz, Adreno 308 GPU. microUSB 2.0, Dual SIM tray, 3.5mm audio jack, IR Blaster. 140.4 x 70.1 x 8.4 cm (~69.1% screen-to-body). The year 2017 saw flagships push boundaries of both hardware and price. New releases from OEMs got better, but they also became much more expensive. What if you can’t afford to spend upwards of $800 on a smartphone, though, and don’t need the processing power and features that come at those prices? What if you just want a smartphone that works reliably, and doesn’t cost an arm and a leg? Enter Xiaomi, the not-so-little OEM that can.. Xiaomi’s smartphones deliver great bang for your buck. Yes, the company’s portfolio includes cutting-edge devices such as the Xiaomi Mi MIX and the Mi MIX 2, which are departures from conventional smartphone design and have relatively high asking prices. But in countries like India and other Southeast Asian nations, the Redmi lineup resonates much more deeply than Xiaomi’s own flagship Mi phones for a reason: It’s inexpensive and it works.. With the Redmi 5A, Xiaomi’s taking aim at the early budget end of the smartphone spectrum. With its starting price of just ~$80, the Redmi 5A targets first-time smartphone buyers and those looking for an affordable smartphone that delivers a great overall experience.. So how does the humble Redmi 5A compare to the the competition?. In this hands-on and first impressions piece, we’ll be taking a look at the Redmi 5A through a practical lens Instead of pitting it against flagship smartphones that cost hundreds of dollars more than it, we’ll keep the phone’s price point and target audience in mind.. The Redmi 5A’s humble appearance belies its capable hardware.. The phone’s shell is made of. plastic, though the polycarbonate employed here has a nice metallic finish to it. and just about the same as that of its predecessor, Redmi 4A. In fact, there are only a handful of differences between the Redmi 4A and the Redmi 5A overall, the metallic finish being one of the differences on the outside.. The front of the Redmi 5A, just like the Redmi 4A, is dominated by a 5-inch 720p IPS LCD display. The phone maintains a semblance of symmetry, with a centered earpiece and the front camera and proximity sensor flanking either side. Below the display are non-backlit capacitive keys for Android’s traditional Recents, Home, and Back navigation buttons, and a white LED.. The top of the device has the secondary microphone, an IR blaster (a. surprising feature rarely found on flagships, let alone one at the Redmi 5A’s price tag, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The bottom of the device bears a microphone hole and a microUSB port. USB Type-C has still to make its way to the Redmi Note lineup, so the Redmi line will have to wait its turn.. The left of the device has two slots, one for a single nano SIM and another for a microSD card, as well as another nano-SIM. Unlike the Redmi 4A and other Xiaomi devices, the Redmi 5A does away with the hybrid SIM tray and gives users the option to use two SIM cards alongside expandable storage up to 128GB.. On the right side is a power button and a volume rocker. They’re both are plastic, but they have a decent clickiness to them (surprisingly better than the Xiaomi Mi A1’s, which is about three times the price of the Redmi 5A), but they also have a very slight wiggle to them.. On the back of the device is a rear camera setup a single LED flash. There’s a speaker grille at the bottom, and a small raised lip below the speaker to prevent it from becoming muffled by flat surfaces.. There’s no fingerprint sensor on the Redmi 5A which is a bit of a shame. It’s easier to ignore when you consider the price, but considering it came out in 2017, that doesn’t make it any less disappointing.. doesn’t try to be style icon, which is a good thing. By focusing on a simplistic and safe design, Xiaomi could focus more of its resources on the internals. That’s not to suggest it’s cartoonish or ugly, but it also doesn’t compete against the all-metal devices that have become increasingly popular in the budget smartphone segment.. The use of polycarbonate also helps keep the weight of the device in check. Combined with the smaller device profile, the phone feels solid and easy to handle. One-handed usage was very comfortable for someone like me, who’s used to handling larger 5.5-inch phones. And holding the phone for long periods of times didn’t cause wrist fatigue either.. The Xiaomi Redmi 5A has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 system-on-chip (SoC), an budget, entry-level processor, and it comes in two storage and RAM combinations: 2GB RAM with 16GB storage, and 3GB RAM with 32GB of internal storage.. The Snapdragon 425 is a 64-bit CPU with 4x Cortex A53 processors. Cortex A53 cores usually form a part of the efficiency cluster in big.LITTLE setups, so using them exclusively in a single cluster setup places a limit on what you can achieve in terms of raw performance (though this also results in stellar power efficiency, in most cases).. Even so, Cortex A53 cores are sufficient for routine, low-intensity tasks that an average smartphone user might phone for (which is why they are so popularly used as efficiency clusters). Everyday use scenarios like calling, texting, social media apps, instant messaging, light games, productivity apps and more had no issues running on the Snapdragon 425. The official Facebook and Snapchat apps in particular experienced lag and skipped frames, but even then, the Snapdragon 425 is not the one to bear the blame here.. Downgrading from my daily driver OnePlus 3 (Snapdragon 820) to the Redmi 5A for a few days, it was easy to spot the small delays in tasks that would otherwise happen instantly on a flagship. Splashscreens stayed on for a few seconds longer in several cases, animations would stick around to hide the delay in processing, and so on.. So measuring the Redmi 5A with the same scale as we would a flagship would be stupid — after all, this phone costs 1/10th of a 2017 flagship. Benchmark scores are nothing to write home about, and the general experience of the device obviously does not compare to a flagship. It would be imperative for future buyers of this device to keep their expectations grounded. With the Redmi 5A and its Snapdragon 425, you certainly get much more than what you are paying for, but you aren’t paying all that much in the first place.. The 2GB of RAM in our review unit also constrained how far we could push the device for multitasking, a limitation compounded by the aggressive RAM management found in MIUI. Free RAM as displayed in the Recents panel right after boot never exceeded 700 MB, while the average during use hovered closer to 300-350 MB. Simple app switching scenarios like between IM apps worked perfectly though, and there were no scenarios where essential apps like the Launcher would redraw. Gaming scenarios did lead to closure and reset of apps that were swapped to the background (like Reddit Sync), and it was in such situations do you notice that the phone has a limit on how many apps it can keep open. If you prefer using the Home button and are used to returning back to your old positions in apps, you should definitely pick up the 3GB RAM variant over the 2GB variant, though do keep in mind the bottleneck the budget SoC will create in the multitasking experience anyway.. For software, the Xiaomi Redmi 5A comes with Android 7.1.2 underneath Xiaomi’s own MIUI 9 skin. This is another differentiating point between the Redmi 5A and 4A, as the Redmi 4A was launched with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and MIUI 8 ( and later upgraded to MIUI 9 ). There is no word if the device will receive Android 8.0 /8.1 Oreo, and we wouldn’t hold our breath on it either.. Xiaomi does have a good track record in keeping the MIUI version of several of its devices updated, and this is something that the phone could realistically expect for the future. The phone was on the 1st October 2017 security patch level, but frequent MIUI updates will likely bump it up every now and then.. MIUI 9 is an iterative upgrade. over MIUI 8 that we have extensively covered in our Redmi Note 4 review , and the software experience is largely similar. Several of the headlining features of MIUI 9 like the Xiaomi Smart Assistant were not present on the Global ROM, and even smaller features like the App Vault and Lunar Calendar feature were nowhere to be found despite being launched specifically for India .. MIUI as a whole invites polarizing opinions. Some users like the experience and the extra functionality that it brings over and above stock Android, while others detest the far-reaching changes it does to the stock Android experience. Android Go devices are still a few months away from becoming a viable alternative in the early-budget segment, so there aren’t a whole lot of options in this space.. The Xiaomi Redmi 5A provides an experience that is better than what you can find in this price segment. But owing to its entry level specifications, the bar itself is not too high.. Budget devices from Xiaomi are known for their battery life, and the Xiaomi 5A has large shoes to fill in. To help with that, the phone comes with a 3,000 mAh battery, which should theoretically complement its small 5” HD display and energy-efficient SoC very well.. While the Redmi 5A is unable to compete against the efficiency-kings like the Redmi Note 4, it does manage to get impressive results. PCMark’s Work 2.0 Battery Life test gives it a score of 5h 50m of battery life at full brightness and with wifi and sync active, and a score of 11h 29m of battery life at minimum brightness. This means that you can expect practical results anywhere in between these numbers for your daily screen on-time. Practical usage of the phone allows it to be used heavily for a full day, and beyond with lower usage levels. I personally do miss the battery prowess of Xiaomi’s budget devices when I go back to my daily drivers, because of the confidence of lasting through the entire day irrespective of how often and how heavily I use the device.. When it comes to charging, though, the device is once again a typical Xiaomi device from 2017. There is no fast charging on the phone, so charging the device from 0 to 100 takes close to 3 hours. Across the three sets of data that we collected for charging, the phone shows a surprisingly linear rate of charging, gaining about 3% charge for every 5 minutes of being plugged in with the stock charger.. Owing to its entry level nature, the Xiaomi Redmi 5A is unlikely to attract a large group of experienced developers. Instead, this device will very likely be the first step into the world of Android for budding enthusiasts. And that may not be a bad thing after all.. The Redmi 5A currently does not have its own development forum at XDA, but one can still find a couple of threads for the device .. Notably, there is an unofficial build of TWRP. Unlocking the bootloader of the phone would be similar to other Xiaomi devices, meaning that you will have to utilize the official tool from the company and go through the standard steps.. Because the Redmi 5A is very similar to the Redmi 4A, there is a chance that developers could figure out easier routes for porting third-party development resources between the two phones. ROMs like unofficial Lineage OS 14.1. and others are up and running on the 4A, and the 5A would greatly benefit if the development work had the possibility of being carried over like it does with OnePlus “T” variants.. The Redmi 5A is an entry level device, and there is no running away from this fact. There is nothing in the device that is likely to appeal to anyone running a current generation mid-range or flagship device, and that is absolutely alright, for the Redmi 5A does not aim to win over existing Android users.. What the Redmi 5A aims to do for Xiaomi is provide a device that first-time smartphone users can purchase without hesitation. The 5A extends Xiaomi’s product portfolio to a price segment which, after the failed attempt of the first generation Android One, has seen little action in terms of value purchases. Products in this category tended to be vessels of sub-par specifications and poor user experiences — and the Xiaomi Redmi 5A is Xiaomi’s attempt at fixing this in their own style.. Redmi 5A Color Options: Pink, Gold, Dark Grey. The real deal with the Redmi 5A is its price tag. For just ₹4,999 (~$79) , you can get your hands on the 2GB + 16GB variant of the Redmi 5A. This is a discounted price that is being made available to the first 5 million purchasers, after which, the price jumps up to ₹5,999 (~$95). The 3GB + 32GB variant costs ₹6,999 (~$110), and there’s no discount available on this variant.. The discounted pricing of the base variant makes it an excellent contender for someone looking for a low cost device that still manages to get a lot of things right. For its (discounted) price tag, there is very little fault to be found with the base variant. Perhaps the only thing that a consumer in 2018 would miss would be a fingerprint sensor. But outside of this, Xiaomi has managed to create a wholesome package that will be appreciated by those looking for their first smartphone, or simply a secondary burner phone.. The price tag after discount, and for the higher model make it a little tricky for recommendation. Again, the major selling point of this entry level device is its price, so if you take that away, you are not left with a whole lot to work with. The higher price point starts coming closer to other offerings from Xiaomi, and with some more flexibility in the purchaser’s budget, they can land a significantly better deal with products like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 or other Snapdragon 625 SoC devices. Not to mention, the Redmi Note 4 itself is a year old, so a newer variant for the Indian market should be around the corner too.. As far as competition goes, the most noteworthy competitor comes (surprisingly) from none other than Amazon India. As part of its “Crafted for Amazon” program, Amazon India has tied up with OEM partner 10.or (pronounced Tenor) to manufacture smartphones for selling exclusively on its online platform.. The 10.or D (Tenor D) is the smartphone that competes directly against the Redmi 5A. For the same price tag of ₹4,999 (~$79) as the discounted Redmi 5A, the 10.or D has no “limitation” on its pricing, which means that it will continue to sell at the same price irrespective of the quantity of units sold. And for that price, you get a 5.2” HD display, the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 SoC coupled with 2GB RAM and 16GB internal storage (with expandability options through a dedicated slot), a larger 3,500 mAh battery and a fingerprint sensor. Further, the 10.or D runs a lighter and closer-to-stock UX on Android 7.1 Nougat, and which Amazon claims is “upgradeable to Android 8.0”. The higher variant bumps up the RAM and storage to 3GB + 32GB, but is priced at ₹5,999 (~$95), lower than the competing Xiaomi Redmi 5A.. The 10.or D smartphone does suffer from its own cons. For one, it is purchasable exclusively through the online store, which will pose a difficulty when it comes to buyers looking for their first smartphone. 10.or loses out against Xiaomi’s expanding offline presence, and also loses out sorely against the brand recognition that Xiaomi has managed to build over the past few years in India. Further, reviews on Amazon India for other 10.or smartphones like the 10.or E and 10.or G do not speak too highly of the quality of the products, so consumers would be taking a gamble on that end too. You also lose out on the IR Blaster, which is a feature that isn’t commonly found in current generation smartphones. The camera experience on the Redmi 5A was nothing to talk about, and we do not expect the 10.or D to fare any better either.. The Xiaomi Redmi 5A is a good iterative product from Xiaomi that will help it attract consumers from a price segment it was not touching before. If you are looking for an entry level device on a sensitive budget, our recommendation goes out for the base variant with its discounted price tag. If you can stretch your budget or have higher expectations, you are better off opting for devices with the Snapdragon 62x SoC.. Want more posts like this delivered to your inbox?

Review Xiaomi Redmi 5A Review: Entry-level, but capable. Xiaomi Redmi 5A Review: Entry-level, but capable. The ‘desh ka smartphone’ from Xiaomi doesn’t have any flash or pizzazz to it, but that’s alright. We review the Xiaomi Redmi 5A to tell you if it’s worth the price.. Updated: December 7, 2017 9:17 AM IST. Xiaomi Redmi 5A Design and Specifications. Xiaomi Redmi 5A Software and Performance. The Xiaomi Redmi 5A is priced from Rs 5,999 for the 2GB RAM/16GB storage variant.. The phone features small changes over the Redmi 4A.. The Redmi 5A has a dedicated microSD slot, along with two SIM slots.. Smartphone makers in India may employ all kinds of product and marketing strategies to win over customers, and different brands have enjoyed different kinds of success based on how they take on the market. While Samsung can credit its success to a strong dealership network, years of presence and manufacturing in India before ‘Make in India’ became a fashionable statement, Oppo and Vivo have used brute force visibility and high dealer commissions to achieve a similar level of success. Present in India since 2014, Xiaomi has achieved a lot in the three years since it set up operations in India. All of it has culminated in the Chinese smartphone maker becoming the leading smartphone vendor in the top 50 cities of India , thereby narrowing the gap on traditional market leader Samsung. And there’s been a unique strategy behind this success – affordability and value for money.. Despite having a much smaller offline network than the competition, Xiaomi has managed to overcome the challenges of running an online-first sales model in India to become the runaway leader in the online segment. As more and more people grow comfortable with buying online, they turn to brands like Xiaomi for the sheer value on offer.. Today, we’re reviewing Xiaomi’s most affordable product in India – something that Xiaomi calls the ‘ desh ka smartphone ’. is the follow-up to the Redmi 4A that was launched earlier this year. Not much has changed, but the small changes will help in keeping the phone current. Thanks to its price tag of Rs 5,999, it’s aimed squarely at the masses; it’s the company’s most affordable device available today. Find out if it’s a good bet in our review.. Xiaomi Redmi 4A Review: The new king of affordable smartphones. If you aren’t considering Xiaomi’s high-end offerings, the rest of the product range has a tendency to look, well, the same. There’s a certain uniformity to the design language of Xiaomi’s budget phones, and it shows even in the Redmi 5A. With a plastic unibody design, distinct front and compact feel, the Xiaomi Redmi 5A looks undeniably Xiaomi. Fortunately, it doesn’t feel too cheap; the company has struck the right balance between price and build quality. While the Redmi 4A sports a more square look, the Redmi 5A goes with gentle curves at the edges.. The layout is fairly standard, with the micro-USB port at the bottom, 3.5mm jack and IR emitter at the top, SIM and microSD trays on the left side, and power and volume buttons on the right. Xiaomi is one of the few manufacturers that continues to offer IM emitters on its phones, and even the affordable Redmi 5A gets this niche but useful feature. Additionally, the company has taken user feedback and gone with a non-hybrid SIM tray design. There are separate slots for a microSD card and both SIMs, therefore not forcing users to have to forego one or the other.. The phone has a 5-inch HD IPS LCD screen, which is decent enough considering the price of the device. There is no fingerprint sensor, which is forgivable considering that the technology behind fingerprint scanning on smartphones is still perhaps a bit too expensive for smartphones in this price range. You also get a 5W charger in the box to charge the phone’s 3,000mAh battery.. The specifications of the Xiaomi Redmi 5A are very similar to those of the Xiaomi Redmi 4A, with the phone running the Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 SoC, along with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. There is also a higher variant with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, which is priced at Rs 6,999. The chipset is popular on budget smartphones, but is over a year old now. You do of course have the basics in place, including 4G connectivity with VoLTE support, Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1 with A2DP support and FM radio.. A notable change in the specification sheet comes in the software. The Xiaomi Redmi 5A runs Android 7.1.2 out-of-the-box with MIUI 9 on top. The newest iteration of Xiaomi’s homegrown user interface is cleaner, more efficient and better laid out than MIUI 8. There’s no official word on when the Redmi 5A will receive Android Oreo, but it is likely to see the update in the coming months.. Xiaomi Redmi Y1 Review: Embracing the selfie. On the Redmi 5A, you get the expected set of features and apps, including Mi Drop, Security, Mi Remote and the Google Suite pre-installed. You’ll also find WPS Office, Amazon Shopping, UC News and the Microsoft suite of productivity apps on the device, although the latter lot can be uninstalled. If you’re familiar with MIUI, you’ll find it to be as efficient and comfortable as always. Unique touches include the security app, which lets you set passcodes on individual apps, set up dual apps or a second space on the device, block SMS senders and more.. With the same SoC as that on the Xiaomi Redmi 4A, the Redmi 5A has similar performance as well. Multi-tasking isn’t quite as good thanks to just 2GB of RAM, and frame drops too can be expected considering the limited graphical capability of the device. Additionally, 16GB of storage is very little today, and beyond a handful of key apps and some media, you won’t be able to store too much on the device. However, the price of the Redmi 5A should be kept in mind, and considering that, you’re getting a decent level of performance. The Redmi 5A is good for basic use, and won’t let you down if your usage is simple enough.. Battery life on the Xiaomi Redmi 5A is also predictably similar to that on the Redmi 4A. Charging is a bit slow and once again, it might have made sense to include at least a 7.5W charger. With the low power usage of the Snapdragon 425 and the frugal HD screen, you can easily get a full day’s use out of the smartphone before needing to charge.. The Xiaomi Redmi 5A sports a 13-megapixel primary camera and 5-megapixel secondary camera. The rear camera supports video recording at up to 1080p at 30fps, while the front camera supports 720p video. It isn’t the best-specified camera you can get and indeed the recently launched Xiaomi Redmi Y1 might be a better bet if you want better selfies.. (Camera samples shot on the Xiaomi Redmi 5A). The phone does take acceptable shots in good light, while low-light images tend to suffer a bit of wash-out. Video recording is also basic at best. Once again, with the price of the Redmi 5A in mind, it’s hard to complain about the quality of the camera and images. You will get an acceptable level of quality in most cases, and single-tone LED flash at the back will certainly help you get a little more visibility in low light conditions.. The Xiaomi Redmi 5A is priced aggressively at Rs 5,999, and with the current discount scheme for the first five million buyers bringing the effective price down to Rs 4,999. It’s clearly a mass-market product, aimed at bringing first-time users, low-income buyers and people looking to upgrade from a feature phone to the Xiaomi family. What you get for not a lot of money is a capable beginner smartphone that ticks all the boxes and offers a reliable smartphone experience.. It’s thanks to products like this that Xiaomi has enjoyed all of this success. The Redmi 5A is pure value-for-money and represents the very philosophy that has made Xiaomi the successful enterprise it is today. And at its effective price of Rs 4,999, there’s simply no better smartphone you can buy for this kind of money.. Android 6.0 Marshmallow with MIUI 8.

Xiaomi Redmi 5A review: At Rs. 4,999, this phone is a steal. by Abhishek Baxi January 5, 2018. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Nothing new compared to Redmi 4A. Xiaomi continues to impress with its budget smartphones, and although the Redmi 5A doesnât offer anything extra than 4A, it is an excellent value-for-money smartphone.. Display 5-inch HD (720 x 1280) IPS LCD. Expandable up to 256 GB with microSD card. Rear Camera 13 MP with LED flash. Dimensions 140.4 x 70.1 x 8.4 mm. Xiaomi has been on a roll in markets like India and is steadily outranking well-entrenched market leaders like Samsung. The budget segment, the driving force in developing markets, is where Xiaomi has a strong portfolio.. Xiaomi offers value-for-money smartphones that boast of best-in-class specifications. In last three years in India, Xiaomi has launched several bestselling budget smartphones. The success has also meant Xiaomi going all in crowding the segment with multiple models at overlapping price points.. Early in 2017, Xiaomi launched the Redmi 4A , an entry-level smartphone for first-time smartphone buyers and those on a tight budget. The Redmi 5A is the next in the series, although youâd be hard-pressed to find any difference between the two. I used the Redmi 5A for a couple of weeks, and here are my thoughts on the device.. For this review, I took the low specâd Indian variant of the Redmi 5A, the one with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage, for a spin. In India, Xiaomi has discounted the price of the same to â¹4,999 ($78) from â¹5,999 for the first five million units to be sold, and since thatâs the current price, my opinion of the phone is basis the discounted price.. The Redmi 5A looks just like any other entry-level Android smartphone and is not much of a departure from the Redmi 4A. Itâs all plastic, although the faux metallic finish at the back makes for a fair design choice.. The smartphone sports chunky bezels at top and bottom, but since it only has a 5-inch display, it still is a compact phone that is comfortable to grip and in one-handed usage. The Redmi 5A weighs only 137 grams with a thickness of 8.35 mm, and definitely feels lighter than some of the other phones in the segment.. Just like the Redmi 4A, the Redmi 5A too sports a 5-inch HD display with a pixel density of 296 ppi. For a budget smartphone, the display does a fair job. The images are sharp, and the text looks crisp enough. The viewing angles are great too.. The colors donât really overwhelm you, but thatâs understandable for a phone at this price. I like vivid and saturated displays, but you get what you pay for.. Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processor, the Redmi 5A packs in 2 GB of RAM with 16 GB of internal storage. The higher specâd variant, which I havenât tested, comes with 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB internal storage.. The Redmi 5A isnât an upgrade from the 4A, as is evident in the choice of innards which are identical to the predecessor. But thatâs okay since Xiaomi does well to balance cost and performance for this budget workhorse.. The Redmi 5A is a decent performer for everyday tasks but only for casual users, mind you. If you push it, youâd hit some lags or stuttering when youâre multitasking. You can play graphic-intensive games, but the performance isnât that smooth. Thatâs expected in this price range, really. Xiaomi does well to squeeze in the best it can.. The 3,000 mAh battery lasts for a full day easily with heavy usage. The battery is slightly smaller than Redmi 4A (3,120 mAh), but for most users, over a day of battery life is pretty good.. Unlike the hybrid tray setup that we saw on Redmi 4A and most Xiaomi smartphones in the past, the Redmi 5A offers a dedicated microSD card slot along with the ability to use two nano SIMs.. Like other Xiaomi devices, the Redmi 5A too packs in an IR emitter that allows you to use your smartphone as a remote to control household appliances. Itâs a nifty addition, and while Xiaomi has backed it all along, itâs a shame we donât see it far and wide in the market.. The Redmi 5A doesnât sport a fingerprint scanner which is a fair omission for an entry-level smartphone.. When we look at the camera performance of the Redmi 5A, weâd have to keep its price in consideration. Till recently, most budget smartphones could only manage to offer a passable camera, but the Xiaomi line-up sometimes surprises with sub-â¹10,000 devices that manage to take some good shots.. The 13 MP primary camera on the Redmi 5A is one of those. In bright daylight, I managed to take some great shots with good details and enough sharpness. The camera also manages to lock focus very quickly. The color reproduction is a hit-and-miss though â itâs mostly good in close-up shots.. In low light, thereâs quite a drop in quality, but thatâs expected. The camera can record 1080p videos that are strictly okay.. The 5 MP front shooter is weak and the aggressive beautification by default makes faces look extremely artificial.. The Redmi 5A runs on MIUI 9 , the latest version of companyâs proprietary UI layer based on Android 7.1 Nougat. Xiaomi devices are notorious for not keeping up with the latest Android versions since the company instead focuses on MIUI upgrades over time.. MIUI 9 is one of the better Android skins out there and has a lot of fans. Thereâs evident attention to detail and the user experience is polished and quite cohesive. If youâve used a Xiaomi phone in the past, MIUI is a comfortable territory for you. However, if this is your first one, getting comfortable with MIUI is not much of a task since itâs quite intuitive.. While thereâs a big camp of Android users that prefer stock Android experience, there are also fans of customized UI layers that several OEMs ship their phones with.. Xiaomiâs MIUI is one of the more popular â¦. That said, MIUI is not known as the lightest skin out there, and hence 2 GB RAM is just enough to get you going with almost half a gig of RAM free available at any point. The company claims, not incorrectly, that the latest iteration MIUI 9 improves performance, but it still cannot match what a similarly specâd phone can manage with stock Android over time.. There are nifty tools and utilities baked in â most of them quite handy â including features like Second Space for privacy and Dual Apps to run a second instance of any apps and apps like Mi Remote to use in conjunction with the IR emitter and Mi Drop to transfer files between two smartphones. Thereâs also a security app which bundles a lot of maintenance and optimization tools.. The base variant of Redmi 5A is an excellent value-for-money smartphone.. Xiaomi continues to impress with its budget smartphones, and although the Redmi 5A doesnât offer anything extra than 4A, it is an excellent value-for-money smartphone at its original price of â¹5,999 ($94).. At the discounted price of â¹4,999 ($78), it is a steal, really. But like with all Xiaomi devices, availability will remain a challenge despite company’s major push in the offline market .. The 3 GB + 32 GB variant at â¹6,999 ($110) is a less compelling option as other Xiaomi devices like the Redmi 4 and Redmi Y1 Lite could be better options for most people at that price.. The Redmi 5A is a great option for first-time smartphone users and for anyone looking for a basic Android smartphone on a budget.. Xiaomi , Xiaomi Redmi 5A. Your source for all things Android!.
