Also runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which is pretty neat for a budget phone.. 5 inches, HD (720 x 1280). 3G, 4G (LTE), 2G, 8GB, 16... Please feel free to post your review on this product.. I bought acer zest last may2016 , magaling na phone kahit kaka fb at COC nagagamit ko xa sa 10accounts ko, dahil babae na a adjust ko ung lights sa camera gandang ganda kahit dark to light captured. Pero dahil madali akong magsawa ng phone and since Inaagaw ng anak ko kaya try ko binasag para mapalitan , nabasag ung screen pero ung performance ganun pa rin kahit maraming beses ung mahulog. Until now gamit pa rin ng kaibigan ko.. Plan to buy again acer phone. Its best feature, for me, is its camera. But hindi ko maroot at accelerometer lang ang meron. Have bought my Acer Zest 3G last monday and I have to choose between KATA C2 or ZEST 3G but I choose to buy Acer Zest 3G though they both have the same price.. Ang masasabi ko lang sa zest 3G OKAY SIYA SA OKAY. Design- CLASSY, why? dahil sa lahat ng unit ng smartphones Acer lang ang may ibang uri ng design ng phone di tulad ng iba naiiba nalang sa brand. Portability- Handy kahit medyo mahaba at malapad dahil sa screen na 5.0" at magaan siya and manipis, medyo madulas kasi matte style ang back cover so suggest to buy a case.. Response- FASTER, considering na 10 apps ang na install ko na may kalakihang size. Siguro depende sa external sd card mo yan kasi given na may 8GB na internal storage ang zest 3G but you have to buy an external sd card para mamaximize yung performance.. Listenability- BRAVO! Hindi lang Sony XPERIA ang may good quality sound ng phone pati din Acer dahil may installed DTS Sound sa System UI na lalong nagpaganda sa quality ng sound.. Batter- since 3 days palang siya at 2 beses ko palang nacharge nung bumili ako at kanina lang, 2000 mAh ang battery, pwede na BUT HINDI AKO NAINFORM NA BUILT-in-BATTERY pala, so dagdag ingat sa phone.. ALL IN ALL GOOD! I recommend you to buy this phone dahil affordable na P3999.00 lang. I really the design and display of this phone its very elegant looking so nice to have it much. It was portable also I can bring it always. Easy for me to used it and I have a good time using this phone. All the applications that downloaded on this smartphone has very response quickly so much great.. The battery life has a problem cause it will not take long time to used in it.. 6 days palang sakin pero ang bilis ma lowbat...1st bili ko nag charge ako 4-5 hours ..nagit q xa ng mga 11 hours ngaun 4 hours q nalang xa na gagamit..d naman ako nalalaro tsaka pinapatay q kada charge q ang fon... Pwd q ba xang mapalitan ng battery at saan??. At nakakainis ung mag download ka taz d mo ma open kc sinasabe turn off overlay screen eh kahit san ko na tiningnan wala namang overlay dito..wala din developer kc nag google ako sa developer daw e off.... I bought my new acer last Wednesday. This phone is good in terms in accessibility, speed ,display,and the response. This phone is light in weight apps are customable you can uninstall the person loaded apps if you like unlike other phone you cannot uninstall it. It runs 6.0 Marshmallow OS and widescreen.Good for me and for those acer brand lover.. its very good display and very beautiful... Acer Mobile Phones > Acer Liquid > Liquid Z530 8GB.

View All results for " ". Acer Liquid Zest 3G Review: A budget-friendly, feature-packed smartphone. Acer recently released its newest line-up of value smartphones and for this review it's the Liquid Zest 3G version. So let's check if this smartphone by Acer is worth our money. The Acer Liquid Zest 3G lies in between entry-level and mid-range smartphone, considering the price tag of Php3,999 it's a real budget smartphone for starters and yet it packs a whole lot of features. The box of the Acer Liquid Zest 3G contains the following:. 1 x Acer Liquid Zest 3G. The Acer Liquid Zest 3G comes in Midnight Black (the one in this review) or in Daylight White and it's pretty slim and very compact to carry. The phone has a full front glass, the body is rounded rectangle plastic-built with a curve matte design plus the Acer logo in the back. The phone is easy to hold in the hand, it's neither too small or too big, but it's a bit slippery to hold, so be careful. It's rather is simple looking smartphone which is a bit similar design in the some of the Android One line-ups. The display is clear and nice to look at, thanks to its 5-inch HD IPS @ 1280 x 720 resolution display, you won't see any pixels in the screen. The text and images are crisp and sharp with the display, this is one of the goodies in this smartphone. Another screen feature it boasts is the Zero-Gap display which you cannot see any gap in the display as the screen is attached in the glass. The back part contains the camera, LED flash and the Acer logo. The top part has the audio jack port and the bottom part has the micro-USB port for charging or data transfer. The side has the volume rocker and the power button. The back part has the rear camera, LED flash, Acer logo and the speaker. Inside the Liquid Zest 3G are the following: 2 sim card slots and 1 micro-SD slot. As for the UI and the OS, I'd like to congratulate Acer for keeping the OS or the Home UI as simple as much as possible and is similar to the stock Android look, it is fast and fluid. Only the icons and some pre-installed apps were included, nonetheless there are not much bloatwares that can slow the phone. Also I'm happy to say its already an Android Marshmallow so you get all the benefits of the latest Android OS. The app drawer is from the stock Android Home UI, some system app icons were replaced and there are some pre-installed apps and games that maybe useful, if you don't want them, you can always uninstall or disable. Overall it feels like the stock Android and its a big plus in my view. As for the camera, it has a pretty good quality for the 8MP it offer for the price. The pictures that I took are nicely captured in the camera, its has a focus feature and but sometimes it is slow in focusing. The camera is good taking pictures outdoors but on indoors it starts to produce image noises (or image dots) that you can see when zooming. You can see the sample shots below:. Indoors, good lighting in the room. Indoors, good lighting in the room. Indoor, low-light, Normal mode with Flash. As for the images above, the camera is good especially with its price, the image quality will vary if there is a better source of light. The 5MP front camera is quite good too, it has a wide angle lens so you can better capture your face, body and the background even in close range. (We'll add more pictures soon, so always check this article!). Multi-touch test: 5 touch points. As for the benchmarks results, the Geekbench scored 358 for the for single-core test and 1139 in the multi-core test. Antutu scores about 23343 in its overall phone test and 5825 for the Quadrant standard. It scored 56.4 fps in the Nenamark 2 test which is pretty good for gaming & multimedia. To translate these scores, the Liquid Zest 3G is capable of running low to mid 3D games, those who won't need much processing & graphics power, nonetheless it can run most games except the new 3D apps and games that requires more power. As for our experience with the phone, there is no noticeable lags, the usage is smooth and works the way it should be. Speaking for the DTS Studio Sound feature, it provides a larger sound field with higher vocal clarity and more natural details. Display: 5.0-inch HD IPS @ 1280 x 720 resolution, Zero-Gap display. Processor: 1.3GHz Mediatek MT6580 quad-core processor. Storage: 8GB internal storage, expandable up to 32GB via microSD. Rear camera: 8MP rear camera with F2.0 aperture. Front camera: 5MP wide selfie front camera. Audio: High quality audio with DTS® Studio Sound. The Acer Liquid Zest 3G is a featured-packed smartphone for the very affordable price of Php3,999 that will surely entice people looking for budget phones.. It has a quad-core processor, 1GB RAM a very clear and solid screen and a promising audio output and best of all it's an Android Marshmallow out of the box which is very reasonable for the price. Has a high-quality audio with DTS Studio Sound. The internal storage could have been bigger than 8GB. While the sound details is good, the internal speakers lacks volume. acer liquid zest where to buy,. Geeky Pinas is a Tech News, Reviews and a Lifestyle Site.
