Micromax Canvas 1 has been introduced by Grameenphone in Bangladesh as an attractive 4G smartphone offer. In less than 8K price, you are not only getting 4G, but also a performance master and fine feature smartphone. This kind of combination has been rare in the past from Micromax. 16 GB ROM, 2 GB RAM, 8 MP autofocus dual flash black camera, 5 MP front camera with flash, FHD video recording, 5" IPS HD display are some great specs. Like almost all other low priced Micromax phones, Canvas 1 also comes with a pretty low-performance battery. 7 hours talk-time may not be considered satisfactory by many consumers. There is also no fast charging technology. So, bear that in mind before finalizing your decision.. User Rating: 4.02 ( 4 votes). Micromax Canvas 1 Rating by MobileDokan.

Do Micromax mobiles have high SAR value or emit high radiation?. Department of Telecom (DoT) has set a maximum permissible SAR value in India at 1.6 W/kg. It is a misconception that Micromax mobiles emit radiation above the permissible SAR value. DoT sees that only those mobile handsets that meet the SAR standards would be permitted to import or manufacture in India. Hence Micromax has SAR value below 1.6 W/kg.. Which Micromax phones support 4G and VoLTE (Jio)?. VoLTE feature has been in the frontline category when it comes to buying a smartphone. Much of this can be attributed to the free calling offered by Reliance Jio on VoLTE technology. VoLTE feature depends on the hardware (Processor) and not on the software. Many Snapdragon and MediaTek processors offer VoLTE feature on Micromax phones. All the VDEO series of phones, BOLT Selfie, Spark 4G, Amaze 4G, Canvas Mega 2. Canvas Evok, Canvas Blaze 4G, Canvas 6, Canvas 5 LITE, Unite 4 Plus, Unite 4 Pro, Canvas Silver 5, Canvas Lite Special edition and Canvas Xpress 4G Anniversary edition support VoLTE feature and can be used on Reliance Jio network.. How to fix battery drain issue in Micromax phones?. Battery drain issue is a cumulative effect of several factors. Micromax mobile itself cannot be blamed for draining of the batter. It depends on how you use the phone, what apps you run on the device and also on several network activities like GPS, WIFI, Bluetooth. Make sure you turn off the network activities when not in use, restrict the apps running on background by going to Settings > Battery > Tap the three vertical dots on the top right corner > select the apps to be optimized.. Do Micromax mobiles have overheating issues?. Overheating of the device arises due to the heavy processor. The problem especially arises on a budget phone with mediocre hardware when you use high-end or more power consuming apps. Keep a check on apps installed on the phone and see that the apps are supportive to the hardware. As a precautionary measure, do not use the phone when kept on charging.. How is the user interface (UI) of Micromax Mobiles?. Micromax uses the latest Android for its smartphones which is developed by Google. Micromax has customized the OS to a little extent for its native users to have a sleek experience..

No Expert reviews found for this mobile.. I have purchased micromax canvas 1 recently, i liked its design first, then once i got to know about its configuration got impressed too. I have seen other Chinese brands in to almost similar price range but decided to opt indian brand only.. it has 8/5 mp camera with both side flash. 2 gb ram good display latest android stylish design to check its performance played asfalt 8 game which is smooth. over all a good phone to use. seen 1 issue that my bluetooth is getting on automatically regularly, i spoke to micromax customer care help line for this they said to do factory reset but then also not fixed, now i will go to service center hope it will be solved.. It is costly mobile according to specification. It's price should be Rs 5500. Single variant is big weakness of this company. Indian brand Looks Android v7.0 Front flash camera. No gorilla glass protection Battery capacity very low Only Quad core No sensor Single variant. I am still waiting For a Good Micromax Mobile. Nice Look But Price Few High. It should be Octacore and 1.4 GHz Processor. * Nice look * Android, v7.0. 2500 mAh Battery very less Quad Core 16 GB internal Memory. Enter each Pro in new line.. Enter each Con in new line..
