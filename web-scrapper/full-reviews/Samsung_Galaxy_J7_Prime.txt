The expandable storage, meanwhile, doubles from 16 GB to 32 GB, and there's 3 gigs of RAM as opposed to 2. The 13-megapixel camera, which can actually churn out some decent snaps for a mid-tier handset, also makes a return along with a seemingly improved 8-megapixel selfie shooter. There's also a fingerprint scanner on board, along with a respectable 3300 mAh battery.. Dimensions: 5.97 x 2.95 x 0.31 inches (151.7 x 75 x 8 mm).

It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus, CMOS image sensor.

Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 21.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

Availability Officially announced: 01 Sep 2016. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 3.0 out of 5 stars Great features but freezes at times.. Color: White Gold | Verified Purchase. The phone looks as advertised and come with a charger (110V), a key to open the slots and headphones. HOWEVER, within a few days of using it, the screen has started freezing when tapping on it. It started with the camera app while taking phones. You keep touching the screen but the phone does not respond. Sometimes it takes more than a minute and I have to close the camera and reopen it. It has now started happening in other apps. I find this very strange since I have had the phone about 2 weeks now if so much... It uses the micro sim cards and has two slots and a space for adding more storage space. The photo quality is very good, both front and back and it has a built in flashlight app. Feel free to ask me any questions... I'm considering returning it for a replacement however.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Loving the phone. Color: pink gold | Verified Purchase. I got this phone as a replacement for my Samsung Galaxy j7. It's an excellent full of loving the largest screen and the increased storage. It is also very user-friendly and syncs easily with all of my devices. I love it! The phone also shipped quickly arrived properly packaged. I would also recommend purchasing from this seller.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Love this phone out of the box. Color: White Gold | Verified Purchase. Love this phone out of the box. This was a replacement for my original samsung note. The note was very very reliable and it serve me very well but i have broke the sim card holder..did try to have fix but it only lasted amonth. So i found this j7 when i visit the philippines and most of my relative uses this phone. I almost bought one out there for 13k pesos. I search right in amazon and there it is...i keep searching and found this j7 prime... First out the box experience was smooth without any problem.turn on the phone as suppose to and connect to wifi rigth away again with no issues. Of couse after all the right setting was set. This phone have two sim cards holder....sim1 and sim2 with the sd cad. Sim1 have a dedicated slot and sim2 is together with your sd...external storage....expandable to 256...huh Im very impressed how fast the phone is...wifi handle very well...already tried alot of hot spot. Take pictures and video very good. Use this phone alot in facebook messenger...very happy. I bough this phone mainly for my relative in the philippinez....all us are well connected now. Not to mention my new friend .... we get connected too by this phone. Love it....even though this not the s7 or s8..but they are close. No iphone for me by the way. I will update my rrview later...

Use it to open w/0 pushing the side button.. Just the touching the home button... Added pivtures with new cover and glass protector. So far phone still works as expected. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Won't get 4G/LTE on AT&T in the USA. Update: The firm selling this phone claims the label was applied by Samsung at an overseas distribution point, after they removed the phone to activate it on the local national network. I gave the phone a shot despite my concerns and it does not work on AT&T 4g in the USA. It'll get a lower speed network, but not full 4G or LTE. AT&T worked a while trying to make it happen, but said that internally they found notes saying it is not compatible. The seller processed a return and I bumped the review up two stars. I wish Samsung would sell these in the USA. The reason they do not is pretty obvious: nobody would pay for the Samsung S8 if they could have a phone with these specs. There are several features on this phone not even offered on flagship phones in the USA (FM radio, sual-sim, etc.). The S* is more flashy, but it's not worth the money for what I (and most people) do. Original Review: Bought this "factory new" Samsung phone and it arrives with a fake tamper-evident label over the original factory tamper-evident label, which was previously cut open. The label they put on top is a smudged printed copy of the original Samsung tamper-proof label, only made larger so that it can cover the original. So this is not a one-off mistake. That label was crafted by someone specifically to cover over the factory Samsung label in order to hide tamper seals being disturbed, and I guarantee Samsung did not do it (the printing is bad, and Samsung would not cover a tamper seal with a second one after having opened the original). Again, this is not a one-off. That kind of industry - making fake tamper-proof labels - suggests to me that Mobiles International does this as routine. Either the phone was used or the seller opened the phone to load apps or malicious code on it. Either way these guys are not legit. I processed a return, but Amazon really needs to police these sellers better an make guys like this go away. Oh, and isn't counterfeiting tamper-evident labels using someone's graphics and copyright a federal felony?. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Works great! No problems with phone. Color: White Gold | Verified Purchase. Works great! No problems with phone. International version doesn't display 4G ... However, it does display H+ which is equivalent to 4G.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Defective merchandise, no warranty offered in US. No warranty, after a week it broke, would not recognize a simm card, useless except for internet in a wifi spot Lots of bells and whistles but it just won't work as a phone.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars DONT BUY THIS PHONE IT DOESNT WORK ON TMOBILE........A VERY GOOD PHONE BUT VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE NOT 4G ;LTE ON T-MOBILE. Color: White Gold | Verified Purchase. This phone has frequency which doesn't detect Tmobile network. I spoke with tmobile we were trying to set the configuration this phone but phone has not internet and very bad service. My oldest phone works great on tmobile network with 4G LTE internet and amazing service, and I don't know why this phone does't want to detect the service even i spoke with t-mobile technicians for than 2 hours. we did the configuration many times but not internet not service. We tried even AT&T and doesn’t work at all. Don’t buy this phone and shame on Amazon which allows this kids of phones to be sold on amazon.com I like the phone but it seems it doesn't work in the USA or at least on tmobile.. Was this review helpful to you?. Phone would not turn on after two charges. 1.0 out of 5 stars Waste of money. great phone that arrived on time and in new condition. It is basically the same as a galaxy for half the price. 5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Value. Wasn't a j7 prime when I checked imei...it was Samsung On7....

The metal look at the back and the moulded edge on the front of the device make it much more appealing to eyes.. The display on the Galaxy J7 Prime now comes with Full HD resolution although there is no AMOLED technology, it still uses PLS TFT LCD which is much cheaper, making the device affordable. The 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4 on the device makes it look premium and distinguishable from Galaxy J7 2016. Similar to the new Galaxy A9 Pro’s selfie camera , the Galaxy J7 Prime also now comes with the 8-megapixel secondary camera for sharp selfies. The primary camera though is the tried and tested 13-megapixel unit that has an aperture of f/1.9.. On the software side, the device is loaded with Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system. The OS is tweaked with Samsung’s TouchWiz UI. The new UI looks clean and feels fast during the operation. The octa-core processor and 3GB of RAM handles the performance and multitasking.

Also, the expandable storage comes handy in case you run out of storage..

Please ask the question in above box. Which phone is better between Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime and Galaxy On Max?. I have not used On Max, but I'm much satisfied with J7 Prime. There are no issues with J7 except that it doesn't get software updates overwritten on previous one resulting in full internal memory at regular intervals. It depends on updates, and it's common for Samsung phone, rest all processing is good. After 1 and 1/4 year, the battery still gives the same output. The camera and brightness resolution are unmatched with any other set. It's the value for the price.. Samsung J7 Prime is much better than On Max. Only the major difference is that On Max has a better selfie camera than J7 Prime. On Max has a front camera of 13-megapixel with a front flash LED whereas J7 Prime has an 8-megapixel camera with no front flash. If selfie camera doesn't matter, then go for a Samsung J7 Prime.. Because it's the latest version of Samsung. And it's feature is more than J7 prime. So I would like to suggest that you purchase On Max.. Samsung J7 Nxt is the better mobile in the world.. Samsung Galaxy On Max is better.. What is the difference between Samsung j7 prime 2016 and j7 prime 2017?. No fingerprint sensor, 16 GB internal memory and 2 GB RAM, front flash, super AMOLED display, 720 pixel screen. Fingerprint sensor (pathetic and very slow). No front flash, 32 GB internal memory in new version and 3 GB RAM, 1080 pixel screen, no front flash, LCD display ( super AMOLED is much better), poor gaming performance heavy games lag horribly, there are some Galaxy Note apps which are good.. Overall J7 2016 is much better in everything.. I advice you not to go for J7 prime, it's a pathetic handset because i'm using it and I have been using J7 2016 from last 8 months before getting Prime.. If you don't want Samsung, then go for F1s that is great phone.. J7 2016 has no fingerprint sensor, it has 2 GB RAM and 16 GB internal memory, but J7 Prime has 3 GB RAM and 16 GB internal memory. J7 2016 and J7 Prime have different processors.. Samsung j7 prime 2016 has 16 GB internal and has high price.. Samsung j7 prime 2017 has 32 GB internal and price is low.. 2016 version have 16GB INTERNAL & 2017 Have 32GB.. There is no j7 prime 2016.. Does it have a non-removable battery?. Yes, it has a non-removable battery.. Which one is a better mobile between Samsung J7 Prime and iPhone SE 32GB?. So, if you want Android, then go for J7 or if you want iOS then go for SE.. Both are good at their own place.. SE is better than J7 Prime.. Which one is better between Samsung J7 Prime and Oppo A57?. If you want a better after-sales service then go for Samsung. If you want better selfies and wish to own the phone for a year or two then go for Oppo. Other than that, there is not much difference. Albeit the processor of J7 Prime is better.. Of course, J7 Prime is better than Oppo A57. It has a good build quality, the latest Android version, a decent camera and a good battery life. You can use it one day on a full charge.. Don't think about Oppo and Vivo, just go for Samsung J7 Prime. It has the better camera, display, user interface and more. It also has the brand warranty and Samsung is the best.. Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime is better than Oppo A57.. Samsung J7 Prime is better than Oppo.. User Reviews of Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime. 70 Ratings 25 Reviews. 5 29. 4 16. 3 2. 2 4. 1 19.

Many were looking forward to owning one due to its innovative technology and advanced features. Too bad, looks like we'll have to wait for the next offering. Samsung literally suffered a 2-hit combo from that snafu, first is the PR fall-out, that they might just prove to be incapable of producing safe devices, and second is the financial aspect, where they suffered billions of dollars' worth of losses. Fortunately for them that they have managed to save enough money that there's really no immediate danger of them going bankrupt over a single failed model. Lesson learned for everyone, time to move on.. Moving forward has a name, and this is the Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime, which we hope will be less combustible than it's big brother. It sports a 5.5-inch full HD display, a 1.6GHz octa-core processor paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of flash storage, expandable to 256GB, a 13MP camera, and has LTE-internet capabilities. A 3300mAh battery powers it, and providing an additional layer of security is a fingerprint sensor. It runs on Android Marshmallow out of the box and is skinned with the TouchWiz UI.. Fortunately for everyone, Samsung has a sterling record when it comes to developing mid-range phones, and the Galaxy J7 prime seems poised to continue that tradition. Pundits have even gone far enough as to say that this model is the best in its class, and is definitely provides value for the money.. Right now, the Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime still in pre-order status as we speak, and you can go through online retailer Lazada in case you want to avoid traffic, or if you like going to the mall, you can place preorders though Abenson and Lazada. Take note that this is time-bound, and you have until October 23 to place your pre-order, or else you risk being left out in the cold..

Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime has been priced at Rs. The Galaxy J7 Prime is now available to buy in India. Gadgets 360 rates the phone 8 out of 10. Samsung's high-end smartphones have managed to impress us with their performance in recent times. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the mid-range handsets from the company, which have been unable match the competition in their respective price bands. One of the reasons has been the entry of new Chinese vendors who are offering better features at each price level.. For Samsung, the arrival of the Galaxy J-series was a turning point. According to an IDC data released in August, the Galaxy J-series has been received well in the Indian market and has driven a large proportion of Samsung's smartphone shipments in Q2 2016. Samsung has launched a number of smartphones in this series in the last quarter including the Galaxy J2 (2016) , Galaxy J3 (6) , Galaxy J5 (2016) and Galaxy J7 (2016). Capitalising their popularity, the company also recently launched the Galaxy J5 Prime and Galaxy J7 Prime smartphones. Of the two, we received the Galaxy J7 Prime for review.. The new Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime features a metal body, supports 4G, packs a large battery, and has a fingerprint scanner. The company is also heavily marketing India-specific "smart" features called S Power Planning, S bike mode and S Secure, which have been developed by its R&D centres in India. In our first impressions, the Galaxy J7 Prime looked like a solid competitor in its price segment, but will it be able to live up to our expectations? Let's find out in our full review.. Look and feel Samsung users have been complaining for years about the lack of variety in designs across the Galaxy range. The South Korean company has made a few changes in terms of design in the premium segment, though its budget and mid-range models largely still bear the same old Samsung styling. The Galaxy J7 Prime is also part of that same crowd.. It sports a physical home button just below the display, with capacitive Recents and Back buttons placed on either side. With the addition of metal rear panel, the new J7 Prime looks solidly built, and its rounded sides make it easier to hold the device. At 8mm, the Galaxy J7 Prime is slightly thick, though it feels light for a 5.5-inch phone at 167 grams. The 3.5mm audio jack and Micro-USB port are on the bottom. A Samsung logo is embossed above the phone's display, plus there's more branding at the back.. The metal body definitely gives this phone an edge over others in the same price range. There's also 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass spread across the front, giving it a premium feel. With a screen size of 5.5-inches, the J7 Prime isn't ideal for one-handed use, and during our review period, we preferred using both our hands. The metal rear panel also made the handset slightly slippery, especially with sweaty hands. The power button is placed on the right and is accompanied by a single speaker grille. On the left you'll find the two distinct volume buttons as well as the SIM and microSD card slots. Samsung has emphasised that the J7 Prime features separate SIM and microSD card slots, which is an advantage over hybrid slots which force users to choose between using two SIMs or one SIM and a microSD card.. The rear panel of the J7 Prime sports a minimalistic design and houses the primary camera accompanied by an LED flash. It's worth pointing out that the back panel isn't entirely metal; there are plasticky panels at the top and bottom, though the paint job gives them a metallic feel.. The Galaxy J7 Prime's fingerprint scanner is embedded in the home button and was always easy to use. Fingerprint recognition was quick for unlocking the device. Double-tapping the home button launches the camera instantaneously, and this even worked with the phone locked.. The Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime features a 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920-pixel) display, which is quite bright and vivid with no legibility issues even under sunlight. Colours look good, and black levels are also decent. The 480ppi pixel density means that even text looks sharp. The J7 Prime is great for watching videos and games.. Specifications and software The new Galaxy J7 Prime is powered by an octa-core Samsung Exynos 7870 processor clocked at 1.6GHz coupled with 3GB of RAM. There is 16GB of inbuilt storage, while microSD cards of up to 256GB are also supported. This dual-SIM phone supports two Nano-SIMs with 4G connectivity on both, though only one can connect to 4G at a time. There's a 13-megapixel rear autofocus camera with f/1.9 aperture and an LED flash. There is also an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. The phone has a non-removable 3300mAh battery. Connectivity options on the Galaxy J7 Prime include GPRS/ EDGE, 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n/ac, GPS/A-GPS, Bluetooth, and Glonass.. Running Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the Galaxy J7 Prime comes with Samsung's own TouchWiz UI layered on top. Over the years, Samsung has worked on its TouchWiz UI and it is now much lighter than it used to be a few years ago. One of the biggest changes is the reduction in the amount of bloatware. Much like current high-end Samsung smartphones, the J7 Prime also comes preloaded with a number of Microsoft apps including Word, Excel, OneDrive, OneNote, PowerPoint, and Skype. The home screen also features a Google folder which includes Google apps such as Gmail, Chrome, Google Search, YouTube, Drive, Play Music, Play Movies and TV, Hangouts, and Photos. Apart from Google and Microsoft, the J7 Prime also comes with a folder packing a variety of Samsung apps including the phone's default mail app and Web browser, S Health, Galaxy Apps, and S Planner.. On the software front, the biggest highlights of the Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime are the new S Power Planning and S Secure features. There is also an ultra-data saving mode and S bike mode, though both these features have been seen on previous models. During the India launch, Samsung's Manu Sharma, Vice President, Mobiles Business, had said that the new "smart" features were inspired by insights from the company's wide range of consumers and are 'Make for India' innovations.. S Power Planning basically offers consumers three ways to get more out of the remaining battery life. The three options include Reserve Battery For Calls, which allocates a certain percentage of the battery for calls and messages; Extend Battery Time, which offers three power-saving levels to users to choose from; and Forward Calls, which as the name suggests, forwards calls to another number when the phone runs out of power.. S Power Planning is a different take by Samsung to extend battery life on the J7 Prime, compared to the usual Ultra Power Saving mode we've seen before. To compare, the Ultra Power Saving mode restricts use of apps on the handset and turns off mobile data when the screen is off. It also shuts off battery-hungry functions such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and GPS. There's also a way to limit the use of Wi-Fi and mobile data in the background.. Another highlight feature of the software on the J7 Prime is the Secure Folder which focuses on security and privacy. The feature lets users lock and hide apps with a fingerprint. It's worth mentioning that in order to access the Secure Folder feature users will have to lock the device with a fingerprint. The Galaxy J7 Prime also offers what Samsung is calling Secure Wi-Fi, which encrypts data being transferred over public Wi-Fi hotspots. The S bike mode feature on the J7 Prime smartphone was earlier seen on the Galaxy J3 (6). It is based around the core idea that two-wheeler riders should not be distracted by incoming calls while on the road. Before starting on a journey, a user can enable the S bike mode from the quick settings menu. Once the mode is activated, callers will hear a prerecorded message informing that the person they are trying to reach is currently riding. If the call is urgent, the caller can press 1 to pass it through, and only then will the phone ring to alert the rider. Even so, there's a motion lock feature which will prevent the user from picking up a call until he or she comes to a stop.. For user convenience, Samsung has placed the S Power Planning, S Secure, Secure Wi-Fi, and S Bike mode toggles in the Quick Settings panel by default.. Camera The Galaxy J7 Prime sports a 13-megapixel rear camera with a decently large f/1.9 aperture and an LED flash. The large aperture lets the handset capture more light per shot, resulting in detailed photos during the daytime. Most of the shots taken by the smartphone have good colours and are crisp. We noticed that the handset was able to lock focus quickly, which is an advantage.. In artificial light or low light, the shots taken with the Galaxy J7 Prime still look crisp, though slight graininess can be seen when checking out images at full size. Overall, the rear camera on the J7 Prime performed well in varied conditions. We however wish that Samsung could have offered few more options for video. The phone can record videos at full-HD resolution, but that's about it.. Tap to see full-sized Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime camera sample. The 8-megapixel front camera also sports an f/1.9 aperture which means selfies were detailed. In low-light conditions, the front camera took some shots with a lot of noise and we wish this had been better. The camera app on the J7 Prime was easy to use and launched really quickly.. Performance During the review period, the Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime was able to handle almost everything we threw at it. The octa-core processor performed really well and we had no complaints. It handles games like Dead Trigger 2 with ease. Multi-tasking on the J7 Prime was fine and apps launched quickly.. While using the device, we noticed that there was almost 1.3GB of memory free at any time which was impressive. The 5.5-inch screen is ideal for watching videos and playing games. The sound quality from speakers was surprisingly good and we didn't notice any distortion at higher volumes. Samsung didn't send us headphones with the box so we tested audio quality through our own headphones, and we were impressed.. We were however slightly disappointed with the fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy J7 Prime. It worked really well most of the time but occasionally gave us a hard time, requiring us to press down on the home button for several seconds. We have seen better and quicker implementation on smartphones priced below the J7 Prime.. During our review, the Galaxy J7 Prime was able latch up to 4G connectivity decently and we were able to use a 4G Vodafone SIM at all times.. In our standard benchmark tests, the Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime performed well with scores of 45,795 in AnTuTu and 23,955 in Quadrant. In 3D Mark Ice Storm Extreme, the J7 Prime returned a score of 5019. However in GFXBench, the phone managed just 11fps.. Battery Life The Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime is backed by a non-removable 3300mAh battery. In our video loop test, the handset ran for 14 hours and 50 minutes, which is not bad for a phone at this price. With medium usage, the Galaxy J7 Prime lasted for almost 36 hours after which we had to reach for a charger.. Apart from regular calls, we used Telegram, Outlook, Gmail, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter which remained open in the background almost all throughout. We also used the camera occasionally and streamed music while performing other everyday tasks. When we added graphics-intensive games and streaming YouTube videos, the battery life came down to less than 12 hours but this is still pretty much standard.. We have to commend Samsung for the new S Power Planning feature which came in handy during the review period. The Reserve Battery For Calls feature was one of our favourite power saving options and was of help a few times when we were unable to charge the phone. It's worth mentioning that on selecting the Extend Battery Time option, users will be left with limited phone functionality as it kills a lot of features. Users can see how much useful time they'll have at the current charge level for each of the three levels available. The option is claimed to give users up to twice the usual amount of battery life.. Samsung is not touting any kind of fast charging support for the J7 Prime but we noticed that it went to 40 percent from zero in just about 30 minutes which isn't bad at all. The phone took slightly less than two hours to charge fully from zero.. Verdict The Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime has been launched in India at a price of Rs. 18,790 and is now available at various retail stores. It has a lot of features such as a metal body, large 3300mAh battery, S Power Planning, and superb screen. S Power Planning and Secure Folder are both neat value additions in software. Despite featuring a large 5.5-inch screen, the J7 Prime is easy to manage. At this price point, the phone is pleasure to use.. The new Samsung J-series handset will easily compete with current favourites such as the Motorola Moto X Play and Lenovo Vibe X3. The Galaxy J7 Prime however faces its biggest challenge with the launch of the Lenovo Z2 Plus which packs a flagship-grade Snapdragon 820 processor and starts at a price of Rs.

The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device.

Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 40.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards.

Share your thoughts with other customers. There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Its an AWESOME mobile under 11K category !!. I'm writing this review on J7 Prime after​using this mobile for one month! So let's get started.. First of all, I'll say that the design of the phone looks very premium and classy golden metallic colour gives it a fabulous look.. It's having a 5.5 inches​ full HD display with a curved glass protection. This phone is very lightweight and easy to hold.. It has a curved back and curved glass on the front.. Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime is powered by 1.6GHz octa-core Exynos 7870 processor and it comes with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. So I'll suggest to use a micro-SD card because nowadays 16GB of internal storage is not sufficient for many users. Have to mention that it has a dedicated memory card slot and two nano sim slots. The battery is of 3300mAh and it easily lasts for a typical working day. But if you are a heavy user then you might have to charge it in the evening. Camera performance is excellent while shooting in the daylight and artificial lighting conditions. Let's talk about the pros and cons: Pros: √ Excellent design √ 2.5D curved display √ Awesome calling performance √ Excellent camera √ Good processor √ Fingerprint sensor √ Very good speaker output Cons: × Less internal storage × No NFC × No automatic light sensor Bought it at Rs.10590 during Amazon Great Indian Festival and it was a great deal. Now it's your decision! 😁 Thanks Amazon!. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars ONLY FOR INDIAN SIM?. It written FOR INDIAN SIM CARD ONLY.

Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars everything on this phone is far better than mi or other Chinese brands. Simply a full paisa vasool deal,everything on this phone is far better than mi or other Chinese brands... I prefer it on mi note 4 and honor 6x and I m totally satisfied with my decision.i saw many videos on YouTube for better decision and every YouTuber says mi is best because it has more ram,more sensors and other lots of stuff but they don't tell that mi has worst service centres and mostly know it So hears positive about this Samsung divice.. 1 camera- I think best in this price aperture is low so it's take great picture in low light conditions 2 Display- it has tft display but believe me it's far better than mi or other.samsung display always top class 3 Battery lost long a hole day with semi heavy use and with moderate use it's works upto one and half day 4 Nogout update makes it invincible Cons- in my opinion nothing So it's up to you that you wants a brand or cheap Chinese one Thanks for reading if like gives a thumsup.
