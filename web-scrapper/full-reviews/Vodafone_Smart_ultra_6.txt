It offers specs that might cost you £300 in a Samsung handset, but only costs £125. That’s without a contract, with no obligation beyond the phone being locked to Vodafone.. If you don’t mind being on Vodafone, this is the highest-spec budget phone you can get without importing something from China. Something bearing a name no-one’s heard of from a retailer some people wouldn’t be too comfortable sharing their card details with. Vodafone can’t be making much money off the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 directly, and reassurances you’re getting good return on your money don’t get much better than that. It makes the Motorola Moto G look overpriced. In return, you just have to live with a phone about as anonymous as they come. A status symbol it is not.. SEE ALSO: Best Budget Phones. The Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 is probably the best-value large-screen phone around right now. But we’re going to start with its weakest element: design.. There are no serious practical issues with the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6’s blueprint, but it is a total style vacuum. It’s as if this was the template from which to start designing a phone, then Vodafone simply said “yep, that’ll do” to ZTE, the company that actually produces the hardware.. The Vodafone Smart Ultra 6’s back is metallic plastic that couldn’t even pass for metal at arm’s length. And despite being a unibody design, there is a contour around the side mimicking where a backplate seam would lie. Normally that’s what unibody phones to their best to avoid: seams.. Then there’s the volume buttons, which are just a slightly different colour to the shell, but not enough to appear deliberate. And the one part that really does seem deliberate, the blue light-up soft keys, come across as a little juvenile.. The Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 seems a design without all that much attention to detail, with external elements that simply fit the mission statement “make sure it fits the budget”. Sounds damning? Stick with us because this is probably the worst part of the phone.. It’s probably not a phone whose looks you’ll ever be proud of, or something that’ll make friends jealous unless they’re bargain hunters.. SEE ALSO: 13 Best Smartphones and Mobile Phones. However, the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6’s build quality is perfectly sound. It’s plastic and fairly large, but doesn’t flex or creak. You may not have owned a ZTE phone before, but it knows how to make the things.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

It does seem to take pressure a little less confidently than Gorilla Glass 3 but as yet we’ve not been able to find out the exact glass used. And while the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 is fairly large, it’s not unduly chunky at 8.35mm thick.. Like all the best giant-screen phones, it puts the power button right under your thumb, dropping it half-way down one side. The soft keys aren’t a Nexus 6 -like stretch to reach either.. The Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 may be about as spiced-up as an unseasoned block of tofu, but it certainly does work. And while we may have been a little mean about the phone’s design, it’s not offensive. SEE ALSO: 10 Best Android Phones. One way to look at this is that the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 puts its budget elsewhere. For example, its connectivity and features are a league above what the price suggests. It has 4G, likely to be some buyers’ first experience with super-fast mobile internet, and NFC. These are dead common nowadays, but help keep parity with more expensive phones.. The really impressive stat, though, is its 16GB storage. We’d expect a phone this price to have just 8GB, even one with a smaller, lower-res screen. This should mean most people really don’t have to worry about getting hold of a microSD card, although there’s a tray to accommodate one on the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6.. There’s no IR transmitter, but it’s unrealistic to expect one at the price.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 review - a bargain phablet. facebook twitter google+ email Comments. inc VAT on PAYG (as of 4th May). Page 1 of 2 Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 review - a bargain phablet 1. Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 review - a bargain phablet 2. Battery Life, Camera, Design, Conclusion & Specifications. The excellent £130 Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 sets a new benchmark for budget smartphones. Processor : Octa-core 1.7GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 615, Screen Size : 5.5in, Screen resolution : 1,920x1,080, Rear camera : 13 megapixels, Storage (free) : 16GB (11GB), Wireless data : 3G, 4G, Size : 154x77x8.4mm, Weight : 159g, Operating system : Android 5.0.2. The super-sized Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 was something of a budget miracle when it first launched last July, but eight months on and it's not quite the bargain it once was. Whereas its main competitors have all dropped in price over the last year, the Smart Ultra 6 continues to maintain its £17-per-month contract price, and its Pay-As-You-Go price has actually increased, taking it up to £130 minus your initial top-up.. That's still pretty good for its specification, though, as you're still getting a large 5.5in, 1,920x1,080 display, a 13-megapixel camera, 16GB of storage, a sizable 3,000mAh battery and a powerful Snapdragon 615 processor. However, other phones like the 3rd Gen Moto G , and even the. are now equally competitive, as you can pick up a Moto G for just £110 on Pay-As-You-Go or £11.50-per-month from Carphone Warehouse, while the M4 Aqua costs £170 on pre-pay or £13.50-per-month.. That's a long way from £17-per-month, but if a large phablet is what you're looking for, then the Smart Ultra 6 is still worth a look if you don't mind joining Vodafone in the process, as this is still arguably one of the best value own-brand handsets I've seen in quite some time.. The phone's performance, for instance, is truly astonishing for such a cheap handset. Powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chipset and 2GB of RAM, the Smart Ultra 6 is leagues ahead of anything else in this price range, putting our current budget favourite, the 3rd Gen Moto G,. For instance, in Geekbench 3's single and multicore tests, the Smart Ultra 6 scored 636 and 2,148 respectively, which is miles in front of the Moto G's scores of 531 and 1,625. As a result, navigating through Android 5.0.2 feels much faster on the Smart Ultra 6 than it does on the Moto G, and web browsing is similarly nippy.. Web pages load quickly and it takes image-heavy sites in its stride. When browsing through news sites such as The Guardian, for instance, we only had to wait around two seconds before we could scroll up and down and pan round the home page smoothly without any hitches in performance whatsoever. Likewise, with a Peacekeeper browser test score of 741, the Smart Ultra 6 isn't that far behind last year's LG G4, which scored 841 overall and is five times as expensive.. While its score of 346 in the offscreen Manhattan test in GFX Bench GL 3.0 only equates to around 5.6fps, it's still much better than what we managed with the Moto G, which only produced 103 frames, or 1.7fps. As a result, its GPU is much better equipped to deal with more demanding titles like Blizzard's Hearthstone card game, as battle animations were smooth and fluid and text bubbles didn't stutter at all.. Of course, its large 5.5in display, with a. 1,920x1,080 resolution, makes playing any sort of game an absolute delight, as a much smaller proportion of it is covered by your fingers. Admittedly, the screen's picture quality wasn't quite as good as we were hoping, as our colour calibrator showed it was only displaying a somewhat disappointing 84.7% of the sRGB colour gamut. This is pretty low even for a budget phone, but when we compared it side by side with the Moto G (which has 85.4% coverage), we were hard-pressed to tell the difference between them. Colours looked almost identical in terms of tone and saturation and both looked equally pleasing to the eye.. If anything, the Smart Ultra 6's higher peak brightness level of 498.44cd/m2 gives colours a little bit of extra punch compared to the Moto G, as Motorola's handset can only reach a maximum brightness of 339.38cd/m2. We were also pleased to see the Smart Ultra 6's high brightness levels didn't impact the screen's black levels too much either, as our reading of 0.42cd/m2 is still roughly around average. Meanwhile, its high contrast level of 1,179:1 means there's plenty of detail present and viewing angles are lovely and wide.. Page 1 of 2 Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 review - a bargain phablet 1.

The Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 is a premium smartphone with a budget price. SHOULD I BUY VODAFONE SMART ULTRA 6?. The Smart Ultra 6 is a £125 budget smartphone with a full HD 5.5in IPS display, an octa-core Snapdragon 615 chipset that boasts 13mp (rear facing) and 5mp (front facing) cameras and weighs only 159g.

Vodafone, like other carriers, has started to manufacture its own line of smartphones – namely the Smart Ultra 6 and Smart Prime 6 , two budget 4G smartphones that aren’t quite as budget as the price tag suggests. The Smart Ultra 6 is a 5.5in smartphone with an octa-core Snapdragon 615 chipset that boasts 13mp (rear facing) and 5mp (front facing) cameras and weighs only 159g. But is it better than its smaller brother, the Smart Prime 6? Read on and find out.. See also: The best Android phones of 2016. Also see: Best Black Friday Phone Deals. Vodafone has marketed the Smart Ultra 6 as a budget 4G phone available for only £125, but this isn’t evident by the design of the handset. Similar in design to the smaller Smart Prime 6, the Smart Ultra 6 is available in both grey and silver and boasts curved edges that provide a comfortable in-hand experience. We’re not quite sure why Vodafone only offers grey and silver variations of the handset as we think it’d benefit from an injection of colour and make it stand out from a sea of dark-coloured handsets.. What surprises us the most is that the Smart Ultra 6 is only 8.4mm thin, which is thinner than its little brother, the Smart Prime 6 which measures in at 9mm. It also weighs 159g, which is only 4g heavier than the Smart Prime 6 but boasts a bigger display to compensate for this fact. Though it’s bulkier than premium phablets like the iPhone 6 Plus, it doesn’t make it any less comfortable to hold or use – and again, that’s down to the premium design of the device.. See also: The 25 best Android smartphones of 2015. The VodafoneSmart Ultra 6’s 5.5in IPS multi-touch display is housed within a 154x77mm housing, which gives the device a 70 percent screen-to-body ratio. It boasts a Full HD resolution (1080x1920), which equates to around 401ppi, that provides great viewing angles, vibrant colours and an overall crisp display. That’s not bad for a ‘budget’ phone that costs a fraction of the price of an iPhone 6 Plus or Galaxy Note 4. Most budget handsets max out at 720p.. Let’s talk storage; the Smart Ultra 6 boasts 16GB of internal memory, with no other models with larger storage options currently available. This may seem like a relatively small amount of storage, but many other (similarly priced) budget smartphones only offer 8GB of storage, half of what the Smart Ultra 6 provides. However, before you’re filled with disappointment, it’s worth noting that the handset boasts a Micro-SD card slot, which can boost your phones storage by up to 128GB.. The Smart Ultra 6 boasts an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chipset, which comprises of four 1.5GHz Cortex-A53 cores as well as four 1.0GHz Cortex-A53 cores, a jump up from the Smart Prime 6’s quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 chipset and not what we'd expect to find in a sub-£150 phone.. It also boasts 2GB of RAM, double the amount provided by many other budget smartphones (including the second generation Moto E 4G and Smart Prime 6). However even though the Smart Ultra 6’s processor has had an upgrade, its GPU is slightly better than it’s smaller brother, using an Adreno 405.. Using an Adreno 405 GPU means that the Smart Ultra 6 is fine for casual gaming, but may not give the best experience for the latest processor-hungry 3D games. Nevertheless, we’ve not had any issues with visible lag when using the phone during our testing – this may also have something to do with the upgraded Snapdragon 615 chipset.. When we ran our benchmarks, we were quite surprised by the results we got – especially in Geekbench 3. The Geekbench 3 results showed that the Smart Ultra 6 achieved a score of 2469 in its multi-core mode, and 649 in single core mode. Now, to give that some context, the multi-core score puts the Smart Ultra 6 in line with the LG’s 2014 flagship phone, the LG G3. The single core score of 649 isn’t as impressive as the multi-core score, but still aligns the handset with the likes of the ZTE Blade S6 Plus .. Its score also beat its smaller brother, the Smart Prime 6. The Smart Prime 6 managed to score 1401 in its multi-core mode, almost 1000 points less than the Smart Ultra 6. It also couldn’t match the Smart Ultra 6’s single core score of 949, managing only 464 – which is still a great score for a phone that costs £75, but if performance is high on your list of priorities, we’d opt for the £50 more expensive Smart Ultra 6 rather than the Smart Prime 6.. So how did the Smart Ultra 6 perform in our GFXBench tests? Even though the Smart Ultra 6 the same GPU as the Smart Prime 6, it has a faster processor, which has resulted in an improved score. The Smart Ultra 6 scored 14fps in our T-Rex test and 5.7fps in our Manhattan test, compared to the Smart Prime 6’s scores of 9.4fps and 3.8fps respectively. This makes the Smart Ultra 6 the better option for those of you that are keen on mobile gaming.. In the AnTuTu benchmark test, the Smart Ultra 6 came back with a score of 26,572 and marked both the general performance and game performance of the device as “high performance” that surpasses 60% of devices on the market. It also measured the battery performance as average, with it surpassing 50% of devices on the market. Compared to the score of the Smart Prime 6 (21,842) it’s clear that the Smart Ultra 6 is the winner out of the two budget handsets.. However, there was one surprise – the Smart Ultra 6 scored 1545ms in our Sunspider benchmark test, but the Smart Prime 6 was faster at 1301ms. Sunspider is a Javascript benchmark that is used to compare browsers with each other, and judging by these results, it seems that web browsing is faster on the Smart Prime 6. It's worth noting that in our experience, we didn't have any issues with the browser - it was fast and responsive.. We’ve got some bad news, though. We quickly realised that the back plate (and subsequently the battery) is non-removable, which is something of a pet hate for many Android users. Some users prefer to have a second (fully charged) battery that they can swap with once the first battery has ran out, which is a great idea, especially for those long days. Alas, it seems that the 3,000 mAh lithium-ion battery will have to suffice.. Although with this being said, we’ve noticed no real issues with the Smart Ultra 6’s battery life. We’ve used it pretty heavily in our testing, playing games and testing the camera, and we’ve found that it’d get us through the day without needing a top-up.. See also: Fastest smartphones available in 2015. One of the Smart Ultra 6’s biggest selling points is, like the Smart Prime 6, 4G connectivity. It enables users to have access to the fast 4G network on a budget without having to compromise on the quality of the handset. However, the Smart Prime is branded as Vodafone throughout the handset and software, and as you might expect the Smart Ultra 6 is locked to that network.. Along with 4G connectivity, the handset boasts Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC, GPS and FM radio. It can also be used as a Wi-Fi hotspot, enabling you to access 4G speeds on a Wi-Fi only device.. The Smart Ultra 6 boasts a 13Mp rear facing camera with a maximum resolution of 4128x3096. It boasts standard smartphone camera features including autofocus and an LED flash, and general photography is quite impressive. Don’t get us wrong – it’s never going to compete with the camera of the LG G4 , but it produces photographs with decent levels of exposure and detail, and the noise issue present with the Smart Prime 6 doesn’t seem to effect the Smart Ultra 6.. Standard photo on the left, HDR photo on the right.. The stock camera app boasts several different shooting modes for the rear facing camera that includes panorama, multi-exposure, HDR, interval capture, smile detection and, for those of you that are interested in photography, a fully manual mode. Most are self explanatory and do what’s said on the tin, but we noticed that when using the HDR mode, photos would seem washed out compared to an identical photo taken in auto mode (see above photo for comparison).. The rear facing camera can also support full 1920x1080p HD video at 30fps, though due to the lack of any digital or optical image stabilisation, the videos we recorded were quite shaky when played back – even when we were conscious of not shaking the handset.. What about the front facing camera? The front facing camera isn’t as impressive as the 13Mp rear facing camera, but still offers a 5Mp camera with a maximum resolution of 2592x1944. It also offers video recording, but can only handle 720p HD video.. It doesn’t boast as many shooting modes as the rear facing camera, offering only smile detection (which kept taking photos when we weren’t smiling). It provides a much crisper photo than we were initially expecting, based on past experiences with front facing cameras on budget smartphones, with a balanced exposure and vibrant photos – perfect for selfie taking, anyway.. One point we want to make is that the camera is extremely responsive – more so than some premium handsets we’ve used in the past. It really is a point and shoot experience, as the camera app opens almost instantly and as soon as you tap the shutter, the photo is taken and saved. That’s down to the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chipset and makes the Smart Ultra 6 perfect for capturing those unplanned moments. Great stuff from such a cheap phone.. You’ll be glad to know that even though this is a Vodafone branded handset, the branding doesn’t take over as the company has been conscious of not filling it with bloatware. As a result, there’s only a handful of Vodafone branded apps and one single Vodafone branded discovery widget – apart from that, it’s a rather vanilla implementation of 32-bit Android Lollipop 5.0.2.. This almost Nexus-like user experience is a real plus point for us, keeping things easy and simply. You'll quickly get to grips with Lollipop even if you've never used Android before.. It's worth pointing out that Vodafone has decided on touch sensitive buttons below the screen instead of the currently more common on-screen. This makes them a little harder to reach but also frees up real estate on the display for other content so it's swings and roundabouts..

The Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 is worth its £125 price tag without a doubt. It's one of the best experiences we've had with a budget smartphone, and nothing about this phone suggests that it's budget apart from its price tag. Compared to the Smart Prime 6, this is definitely the better option to go for and we'd definitely pay the extra £50 for it – it's more powerful, has better cameras and a larger, higher quality display. It won't run the latest 3D mobile games but for every day use, it's a great phone and the fact that you can add up to 128GB of external storage means that there’s more storage than you can shake a stick at.

Come, take a seat my friends, because something is happening again in the mobile industry.. When I was young kid (when) started a little website called Coolsmartphone. It was all about a network-branded smartphone called the SPV. For years after we saw networks branding their logo onto phones made by (then) little-known companies such as HTC. As time went on, companies such as Huawei, HTC and others got to the point where they wanted their own brand on the front of phones – not a network logo.. Now things seem to be tipping back the other way. I’m seeing more and more network-branded phones coming out. This one is actually made by ZTE, but you’ll know it as the Smart ultra 6 on Vodafone. It’s basically the ZTE Blade S6 Plus from what I can see.. Perhaps the best bit? As I write, this is £125 on Vodafone Pay As You Go. If you want it on contract then it’s just £17 per month. I’ve got to be honest, it looks a lot like the iPhone 6 Plus when you get it out of the box. There’s no removable back (or battery) and the edges are rounded. It seems pretty light at 159g and well designed. It has some nice style tweaks such as the blue capacitive buttons under the screen. The central one acts as a notification system, softly glowing to let you know if there’s emails or texts you need to look at. I know it sounds daft, but this glowing ring really made the phone stand out from the crowd a bit.. There’s a lot of on-screen pointers to help you through the first few hours with the phone. They’ll guide you around the handset and will tell you where everything is. It also has the “double-tap to wake” function that my usual LG G3 has. This is great for turning the screen on and means you don’t have to fiddle around with the power button all the time. That screen, by the way, is very bright and vivid, even on the default setting, and full HD too.. It is a tad big, and when I compared it directly with an actual iPhone 6 Plus it was noticeable longer.. Measuring in at 154 x 77 x 8.35 mm, it runs on a Qualcomm MSM8939 octa-core 1.5GHz CPU with 2GB RAM and 16GB of storage and a microSD card slot for further space. The screen is a 5.5″ 1080×1920 Full HD display with a DPI of 480.. Around back is a 13 megapixel shooter with a flash and, up front, a 5 megapixel unit. It runs Android 5.0.2 and pretty quickly too.. A bit of a surprise here, as the rear camera performed very well indeed. The zoom function was very natty, and showed you just how far you’ve zoomed in via an on-screen display with “2.0X, 2.1X” and so on. For the camera buffs there’s even a “manual” mode which lets you tweak all manner of bits that I’ve never understood or seen before (if you’re into camera technology, you’ll probably know more than me). What I can tell you is that I was able to change the exposure, ISO, WB and there was even a level guide too. You could also alter the storage location (microSD or on-board storage), plus you can choose whether to have the review image after you’ve snapped something.. You can add interval capture, smile detection, HDR, panorama, multi-exposure (to create a collage) and a stack of filters.. Taking shots does require a tiny bit of waiting. The focus time is a little longer than I’m used to but photos are admirable and came out well. Click on the thumbnails for the original shots.. The phone seems to be made from a lightweight plastic and has a ridge around the rounded edges so you can get a better grip. The front, which has the screen surrounded by a polished black plastic, has a silver frame around the edge.. The right-side of the device has the volume controls, power and the SIM-tray, which pops out should you need to add a new one.. Up top, the 3.5mm audio port.. On the left there’s the microSD card slot which again needs a pin to pop out.. Down the bottom, just the microUSB port.. On the back, and this model is “anthracite” with a new silver model coming soon, there’s the 13 megapixel camera with the flash in the top-left corner. On the lower-right edge is the external speaker (which, I must say, is really rather deep and loud).. I’ve used this phone as my daily driver for quite some time and, as you’ll see from the video and screenshots, it’s got a raft of my own applications on it. Compared to my usual device (an LG G3) I found the screen to be much brighter and the speed of the OS to be just as good.. Out of the box there’s a “Smart Tips” system which helps you find your feet with the phone itself. It’s a useful and appreciated system, especially when you’re using a new Android phone which could have settings and options in a slightly different place.. The notification system, which flashes that lovely blue ring up front, is easy to use and you can pull the tray down from up top to quickly turn your WiFi, torch, NFC, hotspot and much more on and off. In the settings there’s even more options – you can of course alter ringtones, wallpapers, the brightness level and which app you’d like to add as your favourite when you right-swipe on the home screen.. I like how granular these settings go. You can alter when notifications appear, whether to flash the notification “ring”, what notification content to show on the lock screen and more. There’s a data usage monitoring system (ideal if you’re on Pay As You Go), battery monitoring and much more.. Meanwhile, the main apps include the usual Google Apps (and if you have a GMail / Google account it’ll sync everything onto this phone automatically). These include Maps, YouTube, Play Movies, Calendar, Chrome, Drive etc and you can also add a standard mail account if you have one of those too. There’s also a clock app (this will also be your alarm, timer and stopwatch), a deeply detailed contacts system, gallery and the Google keyboard that’ll let you swipe around to write messages.. The home screen, like all Android devices, has the ability to host your widgets and folders and you get the Google Now functionality too.. The messaging system includes emoji and it has va friendly threaded conversation system. Here you can see the Google keyboard which also allows voice input.. Overall the OS is clean, fuss-free and (although there’s a few Vodafone apps) they really don’t get in the way at all – those icons are chunky but clean and everything is simple and easy to use. Plus, as is normal now, you can install apps like Twitter and Facebook to share images directly through the OS.. Earlier I said out felt as quick as my LG G3, but according to the benchmarks it’s actually running a tad slower. Not by much, and it actually matches the HTC One, which is really rather good indeed.. The border at the top and bottom of this phone does make it a two-handed device, plus the design could’ve been a little sharper and perhaps a tad smaller (with a bit less border around that 5.5″ screen) but, that said, for the little amount you’re paying for this ZTE-built phone it’s a really good offer.. Worked well in low-light even if it was a tad slower than I’d anticipated to focus (just take second to setup your shots and you’ll be good). Audio quality? Again, very good indeed – both through the supplied headphones and the external speaker. Other concerns such as the battery life and OS performance were washed away as the handset performed well in both areas.. If I’m honest the specs of this phone are very decent considering the price-point. It’s a quality device which will actually perform and there’s a very good screen which will impress.. Come, take a seat my friends, because something is happening again in the mobile industry. When I was young kid (when) started a little website called Coolsmartphone. It was all about a network-branded smartphone called the SPV. For years after we saw networks branding their logo onto phones made by (then) little-known companies such as HTC.

Now things seem to be tipping back the other way. I'm seeing more and more network-branded phones coming out. This one is actually made by ZTE, but you'll know it as the Smart ultra 6 on Vodafone. It's basically the ZTE Blade S6 Plus from what I can see. Perhaps the best bit? As I write, this is £125 on Vodafone Pay As You Go. If you want it on contract then it's just £17 per month. First impressions I've got to be honest, it looks a lot like the iPhone 6 Plus when you get it out of the box. There's no removable back (or battery) and the edges are rounded. It seems pretty light at 159g and well designed. It has some nice style tweaks such as the blue capacitive buttons under the screen. The central one acts as a notification system, softly glowing to let you know if there's emails or texts you need to look at. I know it sounds daft, but this glowing ring really made the phone stand out from the crowd a bit. There's a lot of on-screen pointers to help you through the first few hours with the phone. They'll guide you around the handset and will tell you where everything is. It also has the "double-tap to wake" function that my usual LG G3 has. This is great for turning the screen on and means you don't have to fiddle around with the power button all the time. That screen, by the way, is very bright and vivid, even on the default setting, and full HD too. It is a tad big, and when I compared it directly with an actual iPhone 6 Plus it was noticeable longer. Specs Measuring in at 154 x 77 x 8.35 mm, it runs on a Qualcomm MSM8939 octa-core 1.5GHz CPU with 2GB RAM and 16GB of storage and a microSD card slot for further space. The screen is a 5.5" 1080x1920 Full HD display with a DPI of 480. Around back is a 13 megapixel shooter with a flash and, up front, a 5 megapixel unit. It runs Android 5.0.2 and pretty quickly too. Video overview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claneyVMlYI Camera A bit of a surprise here, as the rear camera performed very well indeed. The zoom function was very natty, and showed you just how far you've zoomed in via an on-screen display with "2.0X, 2.1X" and so on. For the camera buffs there's even a "manual"….

With a beautiful screen, great performance and excellent internet capabilities, the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 is a revelation for the price. Yet, dogged with a poor camera, average battery life and excessive bloatware, it isn't quite a perfect budget hero.. As recently as one year ago, there wasn't a great deal to say about the budget smartphone market. Aside from hero devices such as the original Moto G , consumers who bought into lower-end handsets would find often find themselves frustrated by mediocre screens and battery life. Manufacturers operated under a maxim of frugality, and even the most bone-scraping of cuts would be made.. Fast-forward to the present, and things have changed considerably. China has awoken, and with it a highly competitive domestic smartphone market. Devices manufactured by the likes of Xiaomi, Huawei and OnePlus are now positioned to flood Western markets, and the established players are beginning to catch on.. Enter the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6, designed by Vodafone and manufactured by telecoms giant ZTE. With a 5.5-inch Full HD screen, 3000mAh battery, Snapdragon 615 processor and 13MP rear-facing camera, the device has formidable specifications. For £125 on Pay As You Go (locked to Vodafone), it presents itself as something of a game-changer, certainly to a British public only just getting used to the idea of a 720p screen at less than £150.. So can the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 really live up to the hype?. The first thing that's apparent when picking up the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 is its impeccable balance. When creating a device that is intended to be both thin and long, while still remaining usable with one hand, balance becomes a considerable priority.. Coming in at a mere 159g, the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 is light without being insubstantial. It feels as though it could take a knock with some confidence, without being so brick-like as to feel clunky.. As for design however, that is another story altogether. Upon first viewing, the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 doesn't make a great impression. As the rear of the device attests, it was manufactured by Chinese giant ZTE and designed by Vodafone. And yet, it leaves the distinct impression that design was not a priority, beyond weight and balance.. It's a nondescript grey slab with the look of having been designed by committee. However, it is pleasingly svelte, measuring in at 8.35mm – making it thinner than the portly Nokia Lumia 930 .. It isn't as though the phone is exactly ugly, rather that it's eminently forgettable. Made from a grey matte plastic, the device has no features to distinguish it, save for a small chrome-effect Vodafone logo positioned carefully on the rear.. One odd feature that further suggests design-by-committee is the simulated rear back-plate. That is to say, around the device runs a raised line that very much resembles a seam, and yet it's impossible to remove the back. Many phones at this price point have a removable backplate, so the decision to fake it here is surprising. On the top of the device is a 3.5mm headphone jack.. The left side of the Vodafone Smart Ultra Six is free from any buttons, instead offering a removable tray for a MicroSD card to supplement the generous 16GB of internal flash memory.. Moving to the right side, you'll find the power button at the bottom, and the volume controls above this. The buttons are sensibly placed given the size of the device, which is something that could easily have gone wrong. The bottom of the phone holds only a micro-USB slot, for charging and connecting to a PC.. On the back is the 13MP rear-facing camera, along with a single bulb LED flash and a small microphone port. Moving down, there is the Vodafone logo picked out in chrome-effect plastic. At the bottom sits the single rear-firing speaker, an inconspicuous 4G logo, and device information to the bottom left.. Lastly, on the front of the device there is the call speaker, a 5MP selfie camera and, the main attraction, the 5.5 inch Full HD screen, covered with "toughened glass" (no Gorilla Glass here).. Around the rim there is a small strip of yet more chrome-effect plastic, which looks as though it will be the first part of the phone to suffer wear and tear. At the bottom are three capacitive keys, laid out in the same manner as on Android Lollipop .. Although it isn't exactly inspiring, the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 must be commended for keeping things simple. It doesn't wow, but nor is it an ugly brick like so many budget devices..

Press enter or click on the search icon. Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 - Screen and Software. Page 1 Vodafone Smart Ultra 6. If you’re not interested in the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 just because it offers 4G at a reasonable price, it’s a fair bet that the screen has lured you here. This is the best screen we’ve seen in a £125 phone to date.. Where other phones at the price use 720p panels, this one is 1080p, meaning there’s no sense of sharpness compromise despite the display’s large 5.5-inch size. It’s big, it’s sharp and its colours are pretty good too.. The best likely have better colour calibration, but there’s no obvious bias or cast, a fairly neutral white balance and natural-looking saturation. No over-saturation, and if there’s any undersaturation it’s not obvious.. Turning on the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 we were expecting to see an obvious reason why Vodafone/ZTE managed to get this 1080p panel in at £125. But we can’t find one: this is a pretty lovely screen.. It doesn’t have a super-effective anti-reflective coating, but taking it out on a sunny day it’s not difficult to see what’s going on. The crucial part here is that the display doesn’t appear appear recessed, which is often the contrast-reducing, reflection-boosting killer when it comes to higher-spec screens in budget phones.. It almost goes without saying at this point, but the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 uses an IPS LCD screen. The ubiquity of this tech more-or-less explains why a phone this cheap can have a screen this capable. And it is the best screen you currently get at the price.. Seems ambitious? Spend a bit more time with the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 and you realise it’s not ambition that has led to this phone, but pure pragmatism.. The Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 runs a virtually untouched version of Android Lollipop, currently 5.0.2. Even the preinstalled wallpapers are the same default ones we saw in the Nexus 6. Of course, this creates less work for Vodafone, meaning it doesn’t have a custom UI to constantly maintain and provide fixes for.. You don’t get away bloat-free, though. The Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 comes with a bunch of Vodafone crapware apps installed, and they’re pinned to the very top of the apps menu. It’s a red stain no amount of scrubbing will get rid of.. If that’s going to drive you up the wall, maybe it’s time to move on. But there’s nothing you can’t simply ignore by living mostly on your homescreens rather than the apps menu.. There are seven of these apps. Direct Access: A link to Vodafone’s accessories store. Discover: Provides info about Vodafone services. Message: A free messenger for Vodafone users. My Web: A web shortcut to a Vodafone page. Smart Flow: A home screen style that cycles through selected images. But it crashed too much for us to use it. Smart Tips: Loads of little tutorials on how to use your phone. Handy for beginners, but underpopulated at the time of writing (there were no ‘Expert’ tips, but there should be by the time you get hold of one). Updates: Lets you install more Vodafone apps..

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. Install more Vodafone apps and, thankfully, they don’t stick to the very top of your apps menu. Some are kinda handy, like Net Perform, which monitors downtime and data usage, and lets you do a speed test.. We tested the phone with a Vodafone 4G SIM and got very strong speeds of 30-odd Mb download, and once even recorded 131Mbit download and 25Mbit upload. That’s no doubt attached to a ‘VIP’ plan we mere mortals don’t usually get to experience. But it’s nice to see how the other half live, eh?. The crucial thing here is that while these extra Vodafone apps are annoying, they don’t really affect the inner workings of the system. The one bolt-on that does is that the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 loads Flipboard when you flick to the left of your left-most home screen. Flipboard is a popular news stream app.. This replaces the news feed homescreens used by HTC and Samsung. But this one isn’t actually a homescreen, it simply loads the Flipboard app proper. Vodafone clearly knows trying anything too ambitious on the software side could easily backfire.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. This case turns your iPhone into a modular device. Samsung's updated DeX desktop experience uses the S9 as a trackpad. The Nokia 8 Sirocco edition is 95-percent glass. Vodafone's Smart Ultra 6 is great value at £125. Own-brand devices appear to be all the rage at the moment, or at least for two of the UK's major carriers, they are. EE's recently launched new smartphones , a tablet and a 4G action cam , while Vodafone too is yielding a steady stream of bespoke handsets and slates. And now, just as EE's dipped its toe into the mid-range with its Harrier smartphone , Vodafone wades into the same waters with the Smart Ultra 6, its "most powerful" own-brander to date. Available from today, the mouthful of a phone is fronted by a 5.5-inch, 1080p display, with a 1.5GHz octa-core Snapdragon 615 humming away inside. For landscapes and selfies you've got 13- and 5-megapixel cameras, and in other key specs you're looking at 2GB of RAM, 16GB of expandable storage, a 3,000mAh battery and Android 5.0 Lollipop running the show. Not too shabby, considering the £125 pay-as-you-go price.. Gallery: Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 | 13 Photos. Vodafone's really stepped up its game since releasing its first own-brand 4G phones. Last year's Smart 4 Power , for example, was chunky and overpriced, whereas both the new Smart Ultra 6 and smaller Smart Prime 6 are more refined and attractively inexpensive. Now, the Ultra 6 isn't the prettiest handset I've ever come across, but it's not without its merits. The uniform, grey plastic that dominates the back and sides of the handset doesn't come off as cheap, and in fact looks well suited to the device. The placement of the main camera lens and companion flash give the rear panel an iPhone 6 vibe, to the Ultra 6's benefit, and the mirrored Vodafone logo fits nicely with the colour scheme. It's also better executed than the mirrored logos EE's coincidentally used on its latest phones. The blue glow emitted by the Android soft keys is also a nice visual touch, and is the calling card of Chinese manufacturer ZTE, which built the Ultra 6 for Vodafone using its own Blade S6 Plus handset as a reference point.. There's more to be said about the design of the Smart Ultra 6 than its visual attributes. It's a well-constructed, sturdy device, with a level of build quality that defies its bargain price. With microSD and nano-SIM trays tucked away on either side of the handset, there's no need for a removable back panel, which means there's one less seam to croak and warp under pressure. At 154 x 77 x 8.35mm, the Ultra 6 is a little big for my liking, and I find it slightly clumsy to use one-handed. It's not uncomfortable to wield in general, thanks to its relatively slim profile, and those wanting 5.5 inches of screen real estate won't feel like there's an excess of phone ballooning around the large display.. The Smart Ultra 6 runs Android 5.0 Lollipop , and while there's a handful of Vodafone bloatware apps pre-installed, you're getting more or less the stock experience. The only real differences from pure Android are the odd rogue app, like the camera, which usurps Google's version. The device's 1.5GHz octa-core Snapdragon 615 kicks out as much power as you realistically need. A few laps in Asphalt 8: Airborne and Real Racing 3 with no noticeable performance issues is testament to that, and in general usage, navigating the menus and jumping in and out of apps is just as fluid as on any Lollipop phone I've poked at.. Needless to say, the Smart Ultra 6 makes a good first impression, and at its price point, I can't think of another handset that offers the same kind of value for money. EE's Harrier, for example, is matched or bested by the Ultra 6 in every column on the spec sheet. And yet, the Harrier is £200 on pay-as-you-go, while the Ultra 6 is only £125. Vodafone will also give you a Smart Ultra 6 for free on contracts starting from £17. For comparison, the Harrier is free on contracts from £19 per month, and that plan includes double the amount of 4G data and minutes as Vodafone's £17 per month tariff. So, there's not much in it if you're taking the contract route, but it's hard to ignore the £75 discrepancy in pay-as-you-go pricing, especially when the Ultra 6 is better on paper in every area. With the Kestrel , EE showed Vodafone how affordable, own-brand phones should be done.

Tags Phones Smart Ultra 6 Vodafone Branded Devices. We chat to Vodafone's Peter Becker-Pennrich about the awesome power of the Smart ultra 6, and how Vodafone packs top-end tech into affordable packages.... If you’re browsing in one of our stores, or through the pages of vodafone.co.uk , you’ll no doubt notice Vodafone devices sitting proudly alongside those from other big name manufacturers. Truth is, we’ve been making our own devices for some time now, and our latest creation is our best yet. But you needn’t just take our word for it…. As Vodafone’s Product Management Director, Peter Becker-Pennrich is a busy man, but we’ve recently managed to grab some time with him for an exclusive chat about the brand new Vodafone Smart ultra 6, in which he was keen to explain exactly what makes it such a landmark device for Vodafone.. But first up: how exactly does Vodafone go about building its own devices, and why?. “We wanted to provide a powerful, 4G-ready smartphone for those with a budget under £100.”. “The idea behind Vodafone devices has always been to provide people with mobile technology and features at prices where they wouldn’t normally be able to get them,” explains Peter. “If you look at the Smart prime 6 for example, we wanted to provide a powerful, 4G-ready smartphone for a budget of under £100.. “The aim for the Smart ultra 6 was to build the best phone we possibly could, whilst maintaining that emphasis on value for money.”. The latter has certainly been achieved. At just £125 on Pay. as you go , the Smart ultra 6 is astonishing value, but don’t be fooled by the low price – Peter and his team have packed the device with top-quality tech:. “Think of building a mobile device like building a car,” says Peter. “Let’s say you’re buying a Mercedes. Most of the individual parts of the car – the tires, electronics, sound system and other parts – aren’t built by Mercedes, they’re built by specialists. It’s the same story for mobile devices – specialist companies build all the individual components.. “That’s how we’ve put together the Smart ultra 6 – we’ve taken some of the most advanced technology in the world and built it into a package that we think is incredibly powerful – in every area. We haven’t made any compromises here; this is absolutely the most powerful smartphone we’ve ever built.”. Those are bold claims, but the specs certainly back them up. The beefy octa-core Qualcomm chipset gives you slick performance and multitasking power, but Vodafone has equally high-quality parts installed all over the phone:. “With the camera for example, we’ve gone with Sony’s 13-Megapixel, industry-leading module,” explains Peter. “It’s the camera that every manufacturer wants in their phones right now, so it’s actually in quite short supply, but it’s the best there is and it means the Smart ultra 6 has similar camera performance to some of the top end smartphones”. “That camera quality translates really well to the screen, which is a 5.5-inch, Full HD display – that’s the same as you’d have on your HDTV at home. And at 400ppi (pixels per square inch), the pixel density is the same as you get on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.. “There’s also a 3000mAh battery in there, which will give you more than a day’s full use,” he adds. “For comparison, that’s almost twice the capacity of the battery in the iPhone 6, and 500mAh larger than the battery in the Samsung Galaxy S6.”. It’s not all about the specs though. As Peter rightly asserts, design is no less important, assuring us that it’s absolutely crucial that Vodafone devices look and feel as good on the outside as they are powerful on the inside…. “Industrial design is incredibly important in any consumer product now, I think,” says Peter. “Think of any desirable object that someone would buy, and it has to have a certain design component doesn’t it?. “When it comes to phones, we look at the specific design trends that are considered hallmarks of a premium device – things like thinness, a metallic feel to the handset, or a thin bezel around the display. Think about your TV at home: if you have a thin frame around the screen it looks very modern, but if you have a thick frame around the screen it looks like it’s from the 80s.. “The Smart ultra 6 has all those modern hallmarks – it’s compact, thin and minimalist. Our industrial design team in Dusseldorf has really done an unbelievable job on the Smart ultra 6 – it’s a beautiful piece of engineering.”. “The message we really want to get across to everyone,” says Peter, summing things up, “is that what when Vodafone builds a smartphone, what we’re actually doing is creating a strong package of components that provide amazing performance and value above all else.. “For the price you’re paying for the Smart Ultra 6, no other device at that price is going to come anywhere close.”. “The Smart ultra 6 compares favourably to other high-end devices out there right now, but the point is that for the price you’re paying for the Smart Ultra 6, no other device at that price is going to come anywhere close. If you wanted an equivalent device from another manufacturer you’d have to pay a lot more money.. “The same thing is happening in the phone industry that happened to the PC industry in the early 90s,” he explains in closing. “Originally people just wanted to buy standalone PCs, but then they started to become more conscious of individual components. Only recently, people are starting to understand and care more about the components inside their phones as well.. “That’s what the Smart ultra 6 is all about – it’s a customised package of all the best technology on the market right now. We’ve taken a brilliant hi-res display, industry-leading cameras, a high-powered chipset and battery, and Android 5.0 Lollipop and wrapped it all up into a great all-round package.”.

Share your thoughts with other customers. There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars Does everything you need your £650 Iphone to do but without the ridiculous price tag.. I previously owned a Samsung Note 4 which at the time cost around £650 before I dropped it in a river by accident (don't ask). I paid £115 including VAT and delivery for this phone through amazon for what I think is essentially the same phone. Pros THE PRICE Looks like a £700 Samsung/Apple phone Excellent almost vanilla and very slick android OS Big bright screen My Samsung chargers compatible Good camera Good battery life Cons Only works on Vodafone network - Fine by me. Branded Vodafone - so what? not bothered Frame feels light and cheaper - It is a phone not a piece of jewellery. They had to save money somewhere. Lots of clever but unnecessary functions you get on Samsung and Iphone are not in this phone - Never used them anyway Conclusion: Samsung and even dare I say Apple are going to really struggle to persuade most of their followers to part with £600 or a large monthly contract when their current one expires. Wealthy folk who don't care might happily ignore this comment and waste their money on the latest and greatest, but for most I suspect these low cost phones will become the norm, almost throw away items. People will start saying again: "it's just a phone". The hardware is just not that relevant to most people, it is the software on it that matters. For example if I so wish I can still use the NFC function to turn this phone into a digital wallet just the same as an Iphone or a samsung that costs 6 times the price. The price difference is now so immense it completely kills any argument of I love apple. Well I certainly liked the look of my bank balance on this phone afterwards.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Had it for 19 months and for the money it's fantastic value. I didn't want a super-expensive rocketship. Had it for 19 months and for the money it's fantastic value. I didn't want a super-expensive rocketship, just a big screen, decent performance / quality Android phone with all the normal features. Never had a single issue with it. I got it unlocked via ebay and it's working just fine with a £11 a month pay-as-you-go 3 SIM. Dropped in a decent memory card and it's perfect for watching films / storing music etc. One thing, it's a bit slippery to hold so I bought a slim gel case (via Amazon seller) which works a treat. An absolute bargain in my eyes.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great phone, great price.. Have only had it a short time but it has a very clear screen and seems to take great pictures. You wouldn't be disappointed if you'd paid twice as much.Why anyone would want to buy an Apple phone when you can have one of these for close to £100 amazes me. This should be the biggest selling phone ever if phone sales were based on value for money. It was an upgrade for the other half as he Moto G (1st gen) was starting to get a bit slow and kept filling up with the amount of photos she was taking and only 8MB total memory. This has a much better camera and also takes an SD card if required. It is though a LOT bigger, so if you're ordering it online and haven't seen it in the flesh you need to be aware that it is just about as big as the iphone 6 plus. Be prepared, but it is lovely.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Just buy it. Would have given this six stars if I could. Bought it after researching 'budget' smartphones and finding this one top of the list - was a little skeptical (having never heard of it before), but honestly this is one of the best phones I have ever had. Physically perfect (big, but not so big you need to use two hands), and Android 5 is an absolute delight - something I never imagined I would say, being an iOS native. I unlocked the phone to use with another service provider, and again, that was almost laughably straightforward. Bought a code from eBay (£1.99), and within minutes it was unlocked. If you're looking for a great experience and don't want to pay through the nose, this is the phone for you. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars A Great Phone. This was my first move into the 'large' smartphone market having had a couple of small, cheap smartphones previously. I'm not a huge user of the phone for calls or texts, but do use it for browsing and, increasingly, was getting frustrated by the camera capabilities of my previous phone. As someone who isn't attached biologically at the hip to my phone, I wasn't interested in paying the kind of money demanded by Apple, Samsung, Sony etc for their phones with decent screens and cameras, so started reading the reviews on this next tier down (oh, OK, several tiers down !). This Vodafone seemed to be getting good reviews all round, so I decided to give it a try as it wouldn't be a disastrous mistake at the price if it didn't live up to the review hype. There was also the potential issue that it said it was locked into Vodafone, but again, I didn't want to pay their charges so looked for ways around this. So, the actual results? The network lock turned out to be a non-issue. I'd already read that you can get an unlock code off ebay, so bought one of those for less than £2. However, when I came to turn the phone on with my new network provider (TalkTalk Mobile), hey presto, it worked straight out of the box. Does this mean that the network lock doesn't actually exist? Does it mean that TalkTalk use Vodafone as their carrier so the phone couldn't tell the difference? Was I just lucky? I really don't know, I just know that the phone attached to TalkTalk without any issues at all. And the phone itself? My previous standards were, I must admit, pretty low (a Samsung Ace and a Huawei Ascend), but this Vodafone Smart Ultra is so far ahead in terms of ease of operation, functionality, screen resolution, performance that there is absolutely no comparison - this phone is simply excellent. The camera, one of my main drivers? Does it match the performance of my Canon 7D Mk II DSLR? No, of course not. But in reasonable light, taking pictures of stationary objects, I can say that it's only a smidgen behind. Of course, once you start to stretch it a bit you don't have the control over shutter speed etc so moving objects are more of a challenge. But overall I am much more than satisfied with the camera capabilities of the phone. Why not 5 stars? There was the issue that without a bit of research and knowledge I'd have been tied in to the expensive Vodafone network. There's one or two things that frustratingly don't work consistently, e.g. the double tap to unlock the screen. If I could give it 4.5, or 4.75 stars I would, but generally, I would recommend this phone to anyone who feels that buying into the latest Apple/Samsung/Sony latest phone hype is a bit of a rip off.. Was this review helpful to you?. Was fine until it got the latest OS update now the WIFI is pretty much useless - I wouldn't want this phone on my worst enemy. 1.0 out of 5 stars Was fine until it got the latest OS update now the WIFI is pretty much useless - I wouldn't want this phone on my worst enemy..

CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. Some processors have a level 0 cache memory, which is accessed quicker than the L1, L2, L3, and so one cache memories. Besides achieving better performance, it also consumes less power.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors. They increase the performance of the device allowing the execution of multiple instructions in parallel.. The frequency of the processor describes its clock rate in cycles per second. It is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. GPU is a graphical processing unit, which handles computation for 2D/3D graphics applications. In mobile devices GPU is usually utilized by games, UI, video playback, etc. GPU can also perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the CPU..

All these obscure version numbers, build number etc are very confusing and don't seem to make much sense, and, as usual, no one has thought to explain them in a sufficient amount of clarity. Remember, assumption is the mother of all cock ups.. Every country has its own official update path. ZTE's internal version numbers might be somewhat obscure but this still shouldn't be too difficult for anyone who knows numbers and alphabets to know what's the newest one. There's only been a few updates anyway.. KonstaT please update with PT_MR02b. Added Greece, Ireland, and Portugal full 5.1.1 firmware packages to the OP. Didn't add stock recovery images for these because it's exactly the same as on Turkish firmware (that can't be right!). Identifiers in recovery.img's default.prop are for Turkish firmware (e.g. :o Also boot.img is identical in all four MR02b 'builds'. WTF ZTE?! Are you using winzip to put these together? :P. Edited December 16, 2015 by KonstaT. I was saying that Greece, Ireland, and Portugal 5.1.1 firmware actually ship with Turkish recovery files (ro.build.display.id=VDF-995NB01- TR _MR02b). There's another set of recovery patch files in /system as usual (vs. ones in recovery directory which is not even extracted during installation BTW) but those don't match the boot.img that comes with the firmware (boot.img is again identical in all four 'builds'). That's also the reason why stock recovery isn't updating even when you update to 5.1.1.. All previous stock recoveries have been unique.. Create an account or sign in to comment.

Share your thoughts with other customers. There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars Does everything you need your £650 Iphone to do but without the ridiculous price tag.. I previously owned a Samsung Note 4 which at the time cost around £650 before I dropped it in a river by accident (don't ask). I paid £115 including VAT and delivery for this phone through amazon for what I think is essentially the same phone. Pros THE PRICE Looks like a £700 Samsung/Apple phone Excellent almost vanilla and very slick android OS Big bright screen My Samsung chargers compatible Good camera Good battery life Cons Only works on Vodafone network - Fine by me. Branded Vodafone - so what? not bothered Frame feels light and cheaper - It is a phone not a piece of jewellery. They had to save money somewhere. Lots of clever but unnecessary functions you get on Samsung and Iphone are not in this phone - Never used them anyway Conclusion: Samsung and even dare I say Apple are going to really struggle to persuade most of their followers to part with £600 or a large monthly contract when their current one expires. Wealthy folk who don't care might happily ignore this comment and waste their money on the latest and greatest, but for most I suspect these low cost phones will become the norm, almost throw away items. People will start saying again: "it's just a phone". The hardware is just not that relevant to most people, it is the software on it that matters. For example if I so wish I can still use the NFC function to turn this phone into a digital wallet just the same as an Iphone or a samsung that costs 6 times the price. The price difference is now so immense it completely kills any argument of I love apple. Well I certainly liked the look of my bank balance on this phone afterwards.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Had it for 19 months and for the money it's fantastic value. I didn't want a super-expensive rocketship. Had it for 19 months and for the money it's fantastic value. I didn't want a super-expensive rocketship, just a big screen, decent performance / quality Android phone with all the normal features. Never had a single issue with it. I got it unlocked via ebay and it's working just fine with a £11 a month pay-as-you-go 3 SIM. Dropped in a decent memory card and it's perfect for watching films / storing music etc. One thing, it's a bit slippery to hold so I bought a slim gel case (via Amazon seller) which works a treat. An absolute bargain in my eyes.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great phone, great price.. Have only had it a short time but it has a very clear screen and seems to take great pictures. You wouldn't be disappointed if you'd paid twice as much.Why anyone would want to buy an Apple phone when you can have one of these for close to £100 amazes me. This should be the biggest selling phone ever if phone sales were based on value for money. It was an upgrade for the other half as he Moto G (1st gen) was starting to get a bit slow and kept filling up with the amount of photos she was taking and only 8MB total memory. This has a much better camera and also takes an SD card if required. It is though a LOT bigger, so if you're ordering it online and haven't seen it in the flesh you need to be aware that it is just about as big as the iphone 6 plus. Be prepared, but it is lovely.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Just buy it. Would have given this six stars if I could. Bought it after researching 'budget' smartphones and finding this one top of the list - was a little skeptical (having never heard of it before), but honestly this is one of the best phones I have ever had. Physically perfect (big, but not so big you need to use two hands), and Android 5 is an absolute delight - something I never imagined I would say, being an iOS native. I unlocked the phone to use with another service provider, and again, that was almost laughably straightforward. Bought a code from eBay (£1.99), and within minutes it was unlocked. If you're looking for a great experience and don't want to pay through the nose, this is the phone for you. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars A Great Phone. This was my first move into the 'large' smartphone market having had a couple of small, cheap smartphones previously. I'm not a huge user of the phone for calls or texts, but do use it for browsing and, increasingly, was getting frustrated by the camera capabilities of my previous phone. As someone who isn't attached biologically at the hip to my phone, I wasn't interested in paying the kind of money demanded by Apple, Samsung, Sony etc for their phones with decent screens and cameras, so started reading the reviews on this next tier down (oh, OK, several tiers down !). This Vodafone seemed to be getting good reviews all round, so I decided to give it a try as it wouldn't be a disastrous mistake at the price if it didn't live up to the review hype. There was also the potential issue that it said it was locked into Vodafone, but again, I didn't want to pay their charges so looked for ways around this. So, the actual results? The network lock turned out to be a non-issue. I'd already read that you can get an unlock code off ebay, so bought one of those for less than £2. However, when I came to turn the phone on with my new network provider (TalkTalk Mobile), hey presto, it worked straight out of the box. Does this mean that the network lock doesn't actually exist? Does it mean that TalkTalk use Vodafone as their carrier so the phone couldn't tell the difference? Was I just lucky? I really don't know, I just know that the phone attached to TalkTalk without any issues at all. And the phone itself? My previous standards were, I must admit, pretty low (a Samsung Ace and a Huawei Ascend), but this Vodafone Smart Ultra is so far ahead in terms of ease of operation, functionality, screen resolution, performance that there is absolutely no comparison - this phone is simply excellent. The camera, one of my main drivers? Does it match the performance of my Canon 7D Mk II DSLR? No, of course not. But in reasonable light, taking pictures of stationary objects, I can say that it's only a smidgen behind. Of course, once you start to stretch it a bit you don't have the control over shutter speed etc so moving objects are more of a challenge. But overall I am much more than satisfied with the camera capabilities of the phone. Why not 5 stars? There was the issue that without a bit of research and knowledge I'd have been tied in to the expensive Vodafone network. There's one or two things that frustratingly don't work consistently, e.g. the double tap to unlock the screen. If I could give it 4.5, or 4.75 stars I would, but generally, I would recommend this phone to anyone who feels that buying into the latest Apple/Samsung/Sony latest phone hype is a bit of a rip off.. Was this review helpful to you?. Was fine until it got the latest OS update now the WIFI is pretty much useless - I wouldn't want this phone on my worst enemy. 1.0 out of 5 stars Was fine until it got the latest OS update now the WIFI is pretty much useless - I wouldn't want this phone on my worst enemy.. Had it quite a while now, and still going strong, no complaints at all.. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Works perfectly and comes at a bargain price.. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Started crashing and turning off after a year or so, doing factory reset did not help. Now it just won't turn on at all, so that's that. 2.0 out of 5 stars Been fine up until these issues hence 2 stars. Bought one that had to be replaced after a few months due to screen detecting touches that weren't happening. The replacement has started to do nearly the same thing. 1.0 out of 5 stars Screen issues with original and replacement. This phone worked reasonably well for about a year. Shortly after, the edges of the screen began to become unresponsive. 1.0 out of 5 stars This phone worked reasonably well for about a year. Nice phone but the screen stopped responding to touch after just 3 months I had repaired under warranty but now it has gone again at about 18 months old As it's no... 2.0 out of 5 stars Disappointing. it is alright good for the price but the camera has just suddenly stooped working and is not saving the pictures, so if possible i would like a replacement if you cannot tell me... 3.0 out of 5 stars it is alright good for the price but the camera has just suddenly .... Great phone, good camera, feels good to hold, nice big screen, but has stopped working properly after 1 year even though it has never been dropped and always kept in a case.. 2.0 out of 5 stars Good but doesn't last long. Truly awful after 8 months first fault is battery, replaced it second fault camera stopped working third fault screen won't work DO NOT BUY THIS VODAFONE ARE USELESS WENT TO... 1.0 out of 5 stars Do not buy this heap of crap.

Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 – review. Autor: Darius Pană , Data: 29.10.2015, 19:48. Specificații pentru Vodafone Smart Ultra 6:. Hardware, sistem de operare și aplicații. Digi Mobil este singurul operator telecom ce a câştigat clienţi prin portarea numărului de telefon mobil în 2017. Încă de când v-am prezentat primele informații referitoare la Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 ne-am arătat interesul față de acest phablet cu un raport optim preț/specificații. Emil Dragotă a încercat să facă rost de o unitate pentru review din momentul în care acest smartphone a ajuns în țara noastră, dar până acum câteva săptămâni nu a avut succes.. Asta până când Vodafone România a decis că modelul Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 trebuie să ajungă și la gadget.ro. Iar atunci când a făcut-o, nu am primit doar o unitate pentru review, ci două. Una dintre ele a ajuns la mine spre a fi testată pe îndelete, iar cealaltă a rămas la Emil Dragotă, care probabil va așterne câteva impresii cât de curând.. Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 a ajuns la noi în cutia de retail, una realizată din carton reciclat și deci prietenoasă cu mediul înconjurător. În pachet, alături de smartphone, am mai găsit un încărcător, un cablu microUSB – USB 2.0, căști, o agrafă pentru accesul la cartela nano sim și la cardul microSD, manual de utilizare și certificat de garanție.. Varianta primită de mine este cea Antracit, Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 putând fi cumpărată și în versiunea de culoare albă.. Fiind un dispozitiv cu ecran de 5.5 inci în diagonală, Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 nu este tocmai compact. De aceea, pe alocuri va mai primi și apelativul de phablet. Raportul ecran/corp de circa 70% nu este tocmai cel mai bun, dar am întâlnit și mai rău.. Aspectul pentru Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 poate fi considerat clasic, fără elemente de design spectaculoase. Colțuri și margini rotunjite și o bandă cromată despre care îmi este greu să-mi dau seama dacă-i chiar din metal sau e din plastic. Și în jurul camerei foto principale găsim o mostră din aproximativ același material.. Partea din față a phablet-ului nu propune niciun logo sau denumirea producătorului, acestea regăsindu-se doar pe spatele dispozitivului: în centru logo-ul, iar jos, cu caractere destul de mici aflăm denumirea modelului și faptul că este produs de ZTE.. Tastele capacitive cu rol de Înapoi, Ieșire pe ecranul de start și Aplicații recente (de la stânga la dreapta) nu pot fi zărite decât atunci când sunt iluminate din spate. Culoarea luminii ce dezvaluie aceste butoane tactile este plăcută (cel puțin din punctul meu de vedere) fiind vorba de un albastru, să-i spunem, intens.. Mi-a plăcut cum tasta Home, cea din centru, în formă de cerc, preia rolul unui LED de notificare atunci când este cazul. Un apel pierdut, un SMS, mail sau orice altă notificare fac tasta Home să se aprindă intermitent. Aveți cel puțin o imagine care exemplifică acest fapt în galeria foto de la sfârșit.. Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 nu arată deloc rău ca aspect. Este un smartphone cu corp unibody, ce nu-ți dă acces la bateria de 3000 mAh. Ai putea să crezi altceva la o primă privire, întrucât există o muchie ce pare că face legătura între spatele dispozitivului și marginile sale. Nu este cazul de un capac, singura îmbinare fiind în dreptul fâșiei cromate.. Materialele sunt reprezentate în cea mai mare parte de plastic, care însă nu mi-a lăsat tocmai impresia că ar fi de calitate ridicată. Nu este rău, doar că pare ușor cam ieftin.. Finisările sunt bune, nu există lufturi sau margini care să agațe, dar construcția generală putea fi mai solidă. Părea destul de rigid, dar după circa două săptămâni a început să mai scoată zgomote neplăcute dacă-l strângeam mai tare în mână. Iarăși, nu ceva foarte grav și nemaiîntâlnit, mai ales în zona de preț în care se luptă Vodafone Smart Ultra 6.. Ecranul lui Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 este un IPS de 5.5 inci cu rezoluție Full HD. De la prima analiză a specificațiilor nu are cum să nu te mire că un astfel de panel poate fi integrat într-un smartphone ce costă sub 200 de euro la liber.. Când display-ul se aprinde, ești uimit din nou. Nu-i nici pe departe vorba de un panel de calitate îndoielnică. Pentru asta stau mărturie culorile aprinse, totuși nu supărătoare, luminozitatea suficientă și unghiurile foarte largi de vizualizare. Ecranul este cu siguranță unul dintre punctele forte ale lui Vodafone Smart Ultra 6.. Mai mult, în bătaia directă a soarelui acest display reușește să-ți facă viața mai ușoară decât te-ai aștepta. Nu este perfect, dar la mai puțin de 200 de euro se descurcă și aici foarte bine.. Sunetul din difuzorul extern, aflat pe spatele dispozitivului, în colțul din dreapta-jos, este foarte echilibrat. Fără un volum maxim care să te dea pe spate, totuși suficient de puternic, acesta își face foarte bine treaba. Prezintă chiar și destul bass pentru o bună experiență multimedia.. Odată conectate căștile la Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 ai parte din nou de o surpriză plăcută. Sunetul este bun, fiind redate corect toate frecvențele. Intensitatea este și ea suficientă, asta dacă nu cauți cumva să le faci rău propriilor timpane.. La începutul acestui capitol trebuie să fac din nou referire la prețul lui Vodafone Smart Ultra 6. Pare greu de crezut că poți avea cu mai puțin de 200 de euro un smartphone cu procesor Snapdragon 615 de tip octa-core și 2 GB de RAM, plus 16 GB spațiu de stocare (11.16 GB real) ce poate fi extins cu un card microSD de până la 128 GB. Acesta a fost și motivul pentru care ne-am dorit foarte tare să testăm acest smartphone. Specificațiile tehnice raportate la prețul de comercializare păreau prea bune.. Poate că experiența în utilizare ne va face să ne schimbăm opinia despre Vodafone Smart Ultra 6. Vă spun că nu este cazul.. Phablet-ul rulează un Android 5.0.2 stock, nativ, fără vreo interfață grafică adăugată de Vodafone. În majoritatea timpului sistemul de operare rulează fluent, tranzițiile se efectuează rapid, nu agață, iar lag-ul este aproape inexistent. Spun aproape, pentru că mai apar scenarii în care Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 te enervează. Nu multe sau dese, dar există.. Mi s-a întâmplat și să se blocheze complet, urmând apăsarea butonului power continuu timp de mai multe secunde spre a închide complet smartphone-ul. Mi s-a întâmplat și să se restarteze singur, din proprie inițiativă și mi-a ieșit de câteva ori din diferite aplicații, fără ca măcar să mă întrebe dacă eu vreau :).. Totuși au fost destul de rare situațiile descrise mai sus. De fapt primele două scenarii s-au întâmplat decât câte o singură dată fiecare în decurs de aproape o lună de când folosesc Vodafone Smart Ultra 6.. Jocurile complexe rulează bine, deși mai există momente când apare lag-ul. Ele nu persistă, ci doar apar și dispar în câteva secunde la intervale nedefinite, fără ca eu să-mi pot da seama din ce cauză.. Aplicațiile preinstalate pe Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 sunt câteva la număr, dar cele mai multe de la Vodafone pot fi dezinstalate. Avem de la operatorul de telefonie mobilă soft-uri precum Cinemagia, Message+, MyVodafone, Protect, Smart Flow, Smart Tips, Updates și Zonga. Pe lângă acestea mai întâlnim Seenow, Dropbox, Flipboard, Keep, Twitter, dar și întreaga suita de la Google.. În tabelul de mai jos aveți toate rezultatele din testele de benchmark la care a fost supus Vodafone Smart Ultra 6:. Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 etse un smartphone ce acceptă o singură cartelă sim, iar aceea trebuie să fie una de tip nano sim. Vitezele de download/upload oferite prin conexiunea 4G LTE sunt de până la 150/50 Mbps, iar în 3G HSPA+ poate atinge maximum 42/5.76 Mbps.. Pe lângă suportul 4G LTE, Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 mai aduce conectivitate fără fir prin Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, NFC, bluetooth 4.0, GPS cu A-GPS, radio FM, iar în contact direct îl putem conecta prin microUSB și jack de 3.5 mm.. Elementele de conectivitate sunt așezate astfel: portul microUSB este pe marginea de jos, sus este jack-ul de 3.5 mm, pe partea dreaptă este locașul pentru cartela nano sim (accesibil cu ajutorul agrafei din pachet), butoanele pentru reglarea volumului și cel power, iar marginea din stânga adăpostește slotul pentru cardul microSD (la fel poate fi accesat cu agrafa din pachet).. Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 nu mi-a cauzat niciun fel de probleme cu elementele de conectivitate, dar mă așteptam la mai mult de la recepția semnalului GSM. Nu știu de ce, poate fiindcă vorbim de un terminal ce poartă denumirea operatorului de telefonie mobilă. Semnalul GSM este prins cam greu și ușor instabil. Fără să mă deplasez vreun metru treceam de la H+, la H și chiar 2G, iar liniuțele de semnal apăreau și dispăreau la doar câteva secunde. Nu am ratat apeluri sau să mi se întâmple să rămân fără semnal în locuri unde știam că ar trebui să fie, dar totuși este ciudat acest comportament.. În apelurile de voce Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 s-a descurcat normal. Calitatea în difuzor este bună, iar volumul maxim suficient cât să auzi și în medii mai zgomotoase.. Camera de 13 Megapixeli de pe Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 se descurcă destul de bine. Nu sunt cele mai grozave poze de la un senzor de 13 Megapixeli, dar să ne reamintim prețul smartphone-ului în discuție.. Detaliile sunt suficient de bine redate, culorile corect reprezentate și doar ușoare ezitări în mediile puternic contrastante. Pentru asta însă putem apela la modul HDR, care însă nu poate face nici el minuni. De asemena, ca majoritatea camerelor foto de pe smartphone-uri, odată cu scăderea intensității luminii își face apariția din ce în ce mai mult și zgomotul de imagine.. Clipurile video la rezoluție Full HD sunt în aceeași temă cu pozele. Detalii destul de bune, culori vii, bine redate, dar cam mult zgomot de imagine odată cu lăsarea întunericului.. Mai jos aveți câteva fotografii făcute cu Vodafone Smart Ultra 6. Prima din galerie este la rezoluția maximă suportată în formatul 16:9.. Clip video facut cu Vodafone Smart 6 Ultra;. Am ajuns la un capitol ce devine din ce în ce mai interesant pentru noi toți, în condițiile în care am ajuns să ne dorim o autonomie care să ne permită măcar să ajungem seara acasă cu ceva energie în acumulator. Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 a reprezentat o surpriză plăcută și din acest punct de vedere. Cu luminozitatea ecranului la 50% sau setată pe Auto, este destul de greu să epuizezi bateria în mai puțin de 12 – 14 ore. Cu o utilizare medie, poți trece destul de ușor și în cea de-a doua zi fără să ajungi la priză.. În testul în care redăm continuu clipuri video pe YouTube prin conexiune Wi-Fi, cu luminozitatea ecranului la 100% și cu sonorul oprit, Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 a rezistat aproape 6 ore. Mai exact, 5 ore și vreo 40 de minute s-au scurs de la un acumulator încărcat la maximum, până ca el să ajungă la 9%.. Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 – 189 Euro preț fără abonament pe Vodafone.ro sau. gratuit cu abonament Vodafone RED 25 pe 2 ani.. ecran de bună calitate ce oferă culori vii, plăcute, luminozitate ridicată și unghiuri largi de vizualizare;. sunet bun atât prin difuzorul extern, cât și prin jack-ul de 3.5 mm;. ansamblu hardware performant (cel puțin pentru moment și raportat la prețul smartphone-ului);. Android Lollipop în stadiu nativ, cu aplicații Vodafone preinstalate ce pot fi șterse, deci bloatware aproape inexistent;. raport optim preț/specificații și experiență în utilizare.. bug-uri software ce restartează smartphone-ul, îl blochează sau care fac anumite aplicații să se închidă spontan;. unele probleme în recepția semnalului GSM.. Dacă atunci când am aflat prima dată specificațiile și prețul pentru Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 ne întrebam unde anume s-au făcut compromisuri, acum, după test, încă ne întrebăm. Nu zic că este un smartphone ideal, perfect, dar la mai puțin de 200 de euro nu știu ce am mai putea găsi. Da, există Meizu M2 Note sau Xiaomi Redmi Note 2, dar acestea două nu sunt prezente în mod oficial în țara noastră. Plus că ambele utilizează soluții MediaTek, pe care unii dintre voi le consideră inferioare celor de la Qualcomm.. Cert este că dacă doriți un phablet cu ecran de 5.5 inci și țineți la partea de garanție, în sensul prezenței oficiale pe piața din România, Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 reprezintă poate cea mai bună soluție.. În afară de câteva bug-uri software, nu am găsit motive întemeiate spre a nu recomanda acest smartphone. Poate că și acestea vor fi rezolvate printr-un update de firmware. În decursul perioadei de testare am primit un update, fără să treacă la o altă versiune a sistemului de operare. Ar trebui ca Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 să treacă și în România către Android 5.1 Lollipop, așa cum s-a întâmplat deja în alte țări. Poate că atunci micile inconveniente software vor dispărea de-a binelea.. Categorii: recomandari reviews telefoane-mobile vodafone. Tag-uri: review vodafone Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 ZTE.

He always gets the error that no server connection is available or registering isn't allowed. He tried it several times at home with full WLAN connection. Thank you! How can we get in contact?. I sent it to email registered for kirschmond account. PhoneCopy support team , 01/06/2017. according to available information, HTC Legend contains Android 2.1 Eclair (upgradable to 2.2 Froyo). So I suppose, your husband's HTC contains Android 2.2 Froyo and he is try to use PhoneCopy Legacy version, which is ready for this Android version. The problem is probably due to an outdated root certificate for SSL communication. It is common for older devices. I will try to help you via private mail. PhoneCopy support team , 01/06/2017.

Hi, I recently uploaded contacts to sync to another device and i deleted all contacts from my account.

PhoneCopy support team , 02/05/2017. Immediately after installing your application on my phone (Android 7.1.1), I log in without problems and download all the contacts from my account on the phone. However, after the second run of the application, I see the message 'Android System WebView not installed'. What happens, really I need to install WebView?. Hello, since version 5 Android Lollipop, WebView is a separate system component (and it is also available on Google Play). In Your case, WebView probably had been updated and therefore it was unavailable in the phone. Due to this situation, warning message was showed (the application without WebView can not run). You really do not need to install WebView (at the first run it was ok, so it was already installed). If the warning message appears at every launch of app, please contact us again. PhoneCopy support team , 10/04/2017. Dear, also on the Nougat 7.1.2 the message "WebView Error" appears at every second and subsequent launch of your app. This is very frustrating for me.

Hi, I reinstalled the app and it now works. I have phone copy premium and when I press synchronise it won't work. I have wifi and mobile data on and still nothing. I've restarted the phone and it hasn't helped. We have 2 Samsung phones registered, both are the same make and model. The one that isn't working was last synchronise on Tuesday 12th at 14.59. Hello, does the app show any error message after pressing Synchronize button?. Have you tried to re-install the app?. PhoneCopy support team , 22/07/2016. No error message, it says checking items on phone copy.com server then nothing happens. No I haven't tried to re install the app, will it work if I do this? I'm confused about why the other phone linked to phone copy works fine?. Hello, maybe the app got into some unusual state. Try to re-install it to avoid this possibility. If is does not help, we will forward this problem to our Android staff. PhoneCopy support team , 22/07/2016. Hi I reinstalled the app and it works, thanks for all the help. You are correct, it should work correctly. Which phone doesn't work for you? We can see last synchronization from Samsung two days ago. Is it that Samsung which doesn't work now?

Want to give my old phone to my Personal Assistant, with the hope that if we both continue to synchronise and update BOTH phones to the account, we will they be able to maintain and update the SAME set of contacts. Really hope so, and if so Phone Copy is even better than expected!. as long as you both sync the phones against the same account, the contacts will be synchronized. The system is also able to handle collisions - changes of the same contact from both phones. You can easily review all changes on PhoneCopy website. As premium user, you can show all changes of each contact (look for the clock icon on contact edit screen).. You can also use our Groups feature which is intended for advanced users and hidden by default (see Settings -> Groups, there is a short help for it). Using that, users are able to assign only part of their data to the other phone (e.g. only business contacts, not the personal ones etc.).

Just download our app from Google Play store. PhoneCopy support team , 08/10/2014. Please, I have Nokia x, I have been using Phonecopy for sometime on it. I just log out and now want to login but this message pops up "please select at least one of writable Android accounts with contacts to sync". Hello, we slightly changed the login screen in recent version of our application.. Now you have to check at least one local contact database to sync the contacts with. The most common choice is "Local Contacts" or simply "contacts".. If you do not see anything on the login screen, try to create one contact in the phone (choose the proper database) and repeat the login process. Sometimes app cannot detect empty contact database. PhoneCopy support team , 15/09/2014. Phone copy is syncing my gmail a/c contacts but not my local phonebook contacts from device and sim.

Would it be somewhere else? I looked under each and see nothing... Sorry, you have to user Account and Settings button in the android application. PhoneCopy support team , 02/09/2014. I recently "upgraded" to the latest version 2.4.10, but now it takes several minutes instead of less than one minute to sync. It seems to be trying to recreaate every text and contact every time I sync instead of just updating the ones that have changed. This is not really an acceptable performance degradation. The older version worked perfectly, and also told me what contacts/texts were added/deleted, which the latest version doesn't seem to do either. the thing you describe is "slow sync". This type of sync occurs only after login to app, it transfers all contacts and sms from phone and server and merges them. Because it transfers all items it takes a longer time. Next time, after the "slow sync" will be "fast sync" and it transfers only changes from phone or server, therefore it is faster then the previous one.. This behavior is the same as in previous versions of PhoneCopy.. We know that your last five synchronizations were "slow sync". But unfortunately, since you are the first user who this issue reports, currently we don't know the reason. We tested it, but for us it works on all devices.. Please, try to re-login ("Advanced & Account" > "Use existing account" > Select an account you want to sync and then press Login. First time sync will be "slow sync" and another one should be already "fast sync".. If your issue persists or not, please, send us your feedback. PhoneCopy support team , 01/09/2014. I somehow also synced that to phonecopy. So I have lost all contacts. How can I restore them from say.. visit deleted contacts page at https://www.phonecopy.com/en/contact/deleted. All removed contacts are shown, sorted by the time of deletion.. Just select all the contacts you want to restore. You can use the check-box in the upper-left corner of the list to change selection of all displayed contacts, also clicking with Shift or Ctrl works as expected.. Once all contacts are restored, sync your phone and they will be transferred back to the phone. PhoneCopy support team , 25/08/2014. I Wonder if i Upgrade to Premium, will that restore deleted and sendt sms before 30 days?.

The problem that occurred was caused by the version PhoneCopy that you are currently using. The actual stable version 2.2.13 is not able to write SMS on phones with Android KitKat (4.4.x / your version is 4.4.2) because new restrictions were added in KitKat that were not in previous versions of Android. We have prepared a new beta version 2.4.9 which is ready for Android KitKat and already fully supports synchronization of SMS.. - from blue link on main screen (above the synchronize button in the PhoneCopy app). - or directly from https://www.phonecopy.com/android/download/PhoneCopy.apk. After install of the beta do relogin in app ("Advanced & Account" > "Use existing account" > Add an account you want to sync and then press Login button). PhoneCopy support team , 21/08/2014.

FOR PRO | FOR RETAIL. Buy & Sell Cell Phone (2). Locked or Unlocked Smartphones (1). Mobile Device Unlock App (2). Unlock your Vodafone Smart Ultra 6. Great Phones We Unlock: Vodafone Smart Ultra 6. IMEI Unlock , UK Network , ZTE. This is an occasional series that reviews some exceptional cellphones that represent either the latest in cutting edge features, or all round great value for money. Available in the UK, the 4G Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 falls into the latter category. In fact, it offers specs that might cost you £300 or more in a Samsung handset, but costs £125. That’s without a contract, with no obligation beyond the phone being locked to Vodafone – but more about that later.. Designed by Vodafone and manufactured by telecoms giant ZTE, one of the top five largest smartphone manufacturers in its home market,and in the top ten, worldwide. The cellphone features a 5.5-inch Full HD screen, 3000mAh battery, Snapdragon 615 processor and a 13MP rear-facing camera, the device has formidable specifications. At 5.5” it’s a big phone and it’s quite simply the highest-spec budget phone you can get without importing something cheap and dubious from China.. With the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 you have a well-known name, with a phone made by a cellphone world leader.. Some of the major players such as Samsung, LG and HTC do offer handsets in the same price range but these are usually with significantly lower specs than the Smart Ultra 6. Alternatively carriers often offer better specs but then add large amounts of bloatware resulting in a poorer experience. Vodafone has avoided this and as a result, delivers the Android experience as Google designed it to be enjoyed.. The Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 has very little bloatware, and a generous 16GB. The internal storage is 16GB of which around 10 GB is available to use, plus there’s a microSD card slot so you can expand the storage up to 64GB.. Sprightly performance includes speeds of up to 150Mbps and upload speeds of up to 50Mbps when connected to a compatible network. The handset remains lost locked to. well and has a strong antenna. The handset offers rich sound while on a call or listening to music.. The handset sports a 13MP rear camera and uses the stock camera app to deliver an easy-to-use feature-rich interface. With a simple swipe next to the shutter button, you can switch between Manual, Auto and the various modes, which include the useful Filters, Multi-Exposure and HDR modes.. The overall look of the phone isn’t really going to scoop any design awards, with no really distinguishing style features that you would find on the likes of a Samsung Edge, an Apple iPhone 6 + or just about any top spec Blackberry, but then it is literally two thirds less expensive than these premium priced cellphones.. When you buy the cell phone it comes locked to – no prizes for guessing – Vodafone, and this can be a disadvantage. Vodafone’s service can leave a lot to be desired, you nearly always have to pay to speak to a customer service advisor, even if the problem is Voadafone’s, and their Pay As You Go rates are somewhat uninspiring, starting at £10 a month for 300 minutes of calls (Giff Gaff offers 250 minutes for just £7.50) unlimited texts and 250 MB of data. Fortunately UnlockBase , the web’s largest remote cellphone unlock website can quickly and efficiently unlock the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6, and with our Price Match Promise we will unlock it for less than the £20 charged by Vodafone for the same service..

Helpful hints on how to use the Smart Ultra 6, and its features. When you are on a budget, one of the biggest questions you must answer is which features you are willing. Whether it’s a lower resolution display, less RAM, less capable cameras, poor build quality, or perhaps an underpowered processor, these are all things you must consider. There’s a host of budget smartphones to choose from, and most tend to compromise at least one area. Here in the United Kingdom, the Moto G (2015). is often viewed as the go-to device for people with limited budgets, but perhaps there’s an alternative, the Smart Ultra 6 that is available from Vodafone UK for just £115.. The Smart Ultra 6 has a unibody design. But, before you get your hopes up with thoughts of the HTC One M9 and its beautiful aesthetics, without being too blunt about it, the Smart Ultra 6 is fairly bland. While many unibody designs will strive for a smooth, sleek appearance without a noticeable seam along the length of the device, the Smart Ultra 6 has gone the other way.. For some reason, the designers went out of their way to put a fake seam on the Smart Ultra 6 that makes it appear as if its has a removable rear panel, except it doesn’t. It isn’t the worst thing you’ve ever seen on a smartphone, it’s just a little odd. On to the dimensions, and the Smart Ultra 6 is 154 x 77 x 8.35mm and weighs 159 grams. For a 5.5-inch handset, it’s quite pocketable, being a couple of millimeters narrower than my Samsung Galaxy Note 4. The bezels aren’t the thinnest you’ve every seen, but then again, they aren’t the biggest either with the handset having a screen-to-body ratio of 70.3%.. The silver volume and power buttons are both on the right-hand-side of the display. The power button is in the middle of the phone, which is far too low for my personal liking but that’s just my preference. The buttons themselves are responsive, easy to find, and reward each press with a satisfying clicking sound. Navigation achieved by way of the on-screen buttons, and there’s a neat blue LED light for notifications that also serves as the Home button.. There’s a speaker on the rear of the handset, along with the Vodafone logo. Up top is the 3.5mm audio socket, with a microSD card slot on the left-hand side of the phone. On the right-hand-side is the SIM slot, just above the volume buttons. As you might expect, the micro-USB port is present on the bottom end of the handset.. When I say the Smart Ultra 6 is bland and inoffensive, don’t get me wrong. The build quality is good, the handset doesn’t creak or bend, and the glass feels sturdy enough. The Smart ultra 6 isn’t a terrible looking handset either, unlike some budget devices that are around. But it is bland, albeit inoffensive. The grey metallic plastic is not unpleasant to hold, the material isn’t terribly slippy in the hand, and it serves its purpose. Thankfully, a case can definitely smarten it up and add some. If grey isn’t your thing, the Smart Ultra 6 is also available in silver.. The Smart Ultra 6 features a 5.5-inch Full HD (1920×1080) IPS LCD display, Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor, Adreno 405, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, a 13MP rear camera, a 5MP front camera, a 3000mAh battery, WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n, and Bluetooth 4.0.. The Smart Ultra 6 is nippy.. The Snapdragon 615 is a mid-range processor with 8 Cortex A53 cores providing enough grunt to play the high-end games such as Asphalt 8 with acceptable frame rates. While the Smart Ultra 6 isn’t going to set new benchmark records, it will do the job, without noticeable strain. The rear of the handset doesn’t become overly hot, but it does get warm after playing Asphalt 8 for around 30mins. Although the Snapdragon 615 does its job well, it is possible to make it stutter now and again. For reference, the Smart Ultra 6 scores 2359 on Geekbench 3, and 31192 on Antutu.. Where some affordable handsets fall down when it comes to the display, here the Smart Ultra 6 carries on going. It’s 5.5-inch Full HD LCD display, with In-Plane-Switching (IPS) technology allows for impressive viewing angles and vibrant colours. I think it’s safe to say that you won’t find a better display on a similarly priced handset. Possibly the only letdown with the display is the lack of an automatic brightness option.. The speaker on the rear of the handset offers a rather middling performance. Its single driver sounds a little thin and isn’t anything to write home about, but, it is acceptable and delivers its top volume without distorting. Call quality is also at a good level, with callers able to hear you talk clearly. You won’t be scratching your ears off, but you also won’t want to be using the Smart Ultra as a portable speaker for any length of time.. While the handset is naturally locked to the Vodafone network, it is possible to unlock the Smart Ultra 6 with a minimum of fuss thanks to the unlock codes found on Ebay, which only around £4.. On to the battery and here the 3000mAh battery really helps the Smart Ultra 6 stand out. Despite having to provide the juice for a large 5.5-inch Full HD display, the battery manages to hold out for around 2 days with light usage. For normal usage, most users should manage to get through the day without having to charge. I found that by 9 PM, I had around 15% left, after the usual notifications, calls and texts, social media, checking accounts and emails, 20-30 mins gaming, and around 20 minutes of YouTube. As with pretty everything else about the Smart Ultra 6, it’s a good result. Not fantastic, not terrible, but firmly in the middle. On average I managed around 4 and a half hours of screen-on time.. Quite often we see these overbearing custom UI’s on Android handsets, whether they are cheap or expensive. Thankfully, Vodafone has refrained from putting its stamp on proceedings, leaving an almost stock Android 5.1.1 Lollipop experience. On that topic, there’s no word as yet when, or if, an update to Marshmallow is forthcoming.. While there are a few pre-installed apps present, that would appear to be the extent of Vodafone’s meddling. Even the wallpapers are stock Android, which is no bad thing. One feature that is missing, however, in common with stock Android, is the ability to see the battery percentage in the status bar. One way to get around it is by installing an app such as. Let’s get to the pre-installed apps. While the apps themselves are no blight on the handset, Vodafone has somehow decided that these apps are to be front and centre when opening the app drawer. There are seven apps pre-installed, and luckily you can uninstall 5 of them. while the other two can be disabled. Other than possibly the Smart Tips and Smart Flow apps, you’ll probably find the pre-installed apps to be fairly pointless.. It would seem that almost all the mid-range budget phones are using a 13MP sensor for the rear camera, and here the Smart Ultra 6 is no different. Features such as HDR, Panorama, Smile Detection, Multi-Exposure as well as the option to add a filter to your masterpiece are present. You can choose between three modes: Manual, Automatic or Mode which gives you access to the features previously mentioned.. As to the quality of the images, that can be a bit of a mixed bag, but for the most part, the sensor copes adequately when taking pictures in good lighting. In low-light conditions, however, the sensor does struggle to give sharp, detailed results, and can look a little washed out. For a £125, the camera is more than acceptable, so long as you are okay with chucking out the odd photo here and there. You can check out the sample shots I took with the Smart Ultra 6 below.. Vodafone partnered up with ZTE to develop the Smart Ultra 6, and the result is a handset boasting an impressive array of components for a very affordable price. Yes, the design is somewhat uninspired and nondescript, but it isn’t terribly offensive, and you can always put a case on it to add a bit of excitement. No, the camera is not going to compete with the Galaxy Note 5 , and yes, the Snapdragon 615 can. stutter at times when you are racing through the apps. But for a handset with a Full HD display, a beefy battery, and competent cameras that usually costs just £115, it’s downright appealing.. I would say that the Smart Ultra 6 is the definitive budget smartphone in the UK at the moment.. If you are on a tight budget, this is the mobile phone you should be looking at. For £115, you just can’t go wrong.. About the Author: Peter Holden. He's been an Android fan ever since owning an HTC Hero, with the Dell Streak being his first phablet.
