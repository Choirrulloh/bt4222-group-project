Gionee Marathon M5 Plus and M5 Enjoy launched. Gionee's Marathon series of big-battery-packing smartphones was just expanded with the addition of the Marathon M5 Plus and the Marathon M5 Enjoy. Launched today in China, the two smartphones address one notable omission from the original Marathon M5 's specsheet - the fingerprint sensor.. The Gionee M5 Plus sits on top of the series and leans towards a higher segment of the midrange. The smartphone comes with a significantly more powerful (though not record breaking) Mediatek MT6753 chipset with an octa-core CPU. There is 3GB of RAM on board, same as the M5, but built-in storage has been doubled to 64GB, and you can further expand it by up to 128GB via microSD.. Gionee Marathon M5 Plus in Gold. Trading-off cell capacity for screen size, the new Plus-size model comes with a 6-inch FullHD AMOLED display and "only" 5,020mAh worth of juice, where the M5s specsheet reads 5.5 inches, 720p, and 6,020mAh. The smartphone measures 160.9 x 81.2 x 8.4mm, which is reasonably compact for the screen and battery size, and weighs in at 208g  3g lighter than the 5.5-inch M5.. The 13MP primary camera on the back comes with phase detection autofocus and a single LED flash, while the front-facer is a 5MP unit. Theres a fingerprint sensor on the front in place of the capacitive home key of other Gionee models. Fast charging is supported and is done via a reversible Type-C connector, though it only adheres to the USB 2.0 standard.. Gionee Marathon M5 Plus in Silver. The smartphone supports multi-band 2G/3G and LTE, as well as Bluetooth 4.0 and runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop with the companys Amigo OS overlay on top, in its 3.1 incarnation. Priced at CNY 2,499 ($385), the Gionee Marathon M5 Plus is available for purchase right now.. Alongside the M5 Plus, Gionee announced the Marathon M5 Enjoy  a smartphone similarly specced to the original M5. However, you better be careful when choosing between the two, as different compromises have been made, potentially affecting user experience.. For starters, the M5 Enjoys display is a TFT unit, whereas the M5 had an AMOLED panel, though both are 5.5-inch 720p units. Battery capacity is in favor of the M5, as the M5 Enjoy comes with a 5,000mAh power pack, and not 6,020mAh. And instead of the 13MP primary camera, the M5 Enjoy only comes with an 8MP snapper. Where the new model trumps the old one is the inclusion of a fingerprint scanner.. There rest is mostly the same  a Mediatek MT6735 chipset with a quad-core CPU, 3GB of RAM and Android 5.1 Lollipop. Internal storage has been sliced halved to 16GB, but is still expandable. The Marathon M5 Enjoy is more modestly priced, compared to the Plus, and goes for CNY 1,999 ($310)..

Gionee, besides the Marathon M5 Plus smartphone, launched another handset dubbed Marathon M5 Enjoy at an event in China on Monday. The smartphone is priced at CNY 1,999 (roughly Rs. 20,400) and is available to buy from company's shopping website.. The Gionee Marathon M5 Enjoy shares almost identical specifications with the original Marathon M5 handset except a lower battery capacity and rear camera resolution. The smartphone also misses the fingerprint sensor at the back panel and instead places it on the physical home button at the front. It is said to unlock the smartphone in 0.5 seconds. The metal-clad smartphone is backed by a 5000mAh Li-Po battery, which the company claims can deliver 52 hours of talk time and 775 hours of standby time.. The Marathon M5 Enjoy runs Amigo 3.1 based on Android 5.1 Lollipop, and is a dual-SIM dual standby smartphone with 4G LTE functionality. It features a 5.5-inch HD (720x1280 pixel) 2.5D TFT IPS display with pixel density of 267ppi, and is powered by a 64-bit 1.5GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6735 SoC, clubbed with 3GB RAM and Mali-T720 GPU.. Featuring 16GB of inbuilt storage, the Marathon M5 Enjoy can also support microSD card (up to 128GB). It features an 8-megapixel autofocus rear camera with CMOS sensor and LED flash, and a 5-megapixel front camera. It measures 155x76x9mm and weighs 200 grams and is available in Gold colour variant.. Gionee at the same event launched its Marathon M5 Plus , which it has been teasing from past few weeks. Readers should note that this product has been launched in China and its India variant may have slightly different hardware and software specifications, according to Gionee .. The big selling point of the Gionee Marathon M5 Plus touted by the company is the smartphone's long battery life. While the Marathon M5 Plus features a smaller 5020mAh battery when compared to the Marathon M5, Gionee claims that it has optimised the battery to reduce the drop in its capacity over time. The company claims that the Marathon M5 Plus' battery retains 90 percent (4500mAh) of its original capacity after 600 charging cycles. Gionee says this translates to roughly 2 years of use..

The Smartphone was launched in China on Monday and it has been hit with a CNY 1,999 ($309) price tag. The Smartphone is now available on the company’s shopping website for any who may want to get one of it directly from the maker.. The newly released Smartphone has some features that make it identical to the Gionee Marathon M5 Plus; the only real difference is the battery capacity and the rear camera resolutions on each of the Smartphones. The new Smartphone does not come with a fingerprint sensor on the back like of some of the newly launched Smartphones; instead, the Gionee Marathon M5 Enjoy has its own fingerprint sensor on the physical home button at the front of the device. The fingerprint sensor has been touted to be one of the fastest after it was discovered that the sensor can unlock your phones in just 0.5 seconds. The Smartphone comes clothed with a metal case, it has a 5000mAh Li-Po battery capacity that has been found to deliver 52 hours talk time and 775 hours standby time.. The Gionee Marathon M5 Enjoy runs Amigo 3.1 based on Android 5.1 Lollipop. The Smartphone comes with a dual-SIM capability and connectivity features that include the Bluetooth, 4G LTE network and USB 2.0 port. The Gionee Marathon M5 Enjoy also has a 5.5-inch HD (720×1280 pixels) 2.5D TFT screen that comes with pixel density of 267ppi. The Smartphone is powered by a 64-bit 1.5 GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6735 SoC and it also comes with a 3GB RAM capacity and MALI-T720 GPU.. The sleek Smartphone sports a large 16GB internal storage capacity and it also supports microSD cards of 128GB. The Gionee Marathon M5 Enjoy comes with an 8MP autofocus camera on the rear, the camera also comes with CMOS sensor and LED flash. The front-facing camera has been clocked at 5MP. Talking of its weight, the Smartphone weighs 200 grams and it is available in Gold color variant for now.. Gionee stated that Chinese and Indian customers may be experiencing a slight difference in hardware and software specs; nevertheless, it assured that each of the devices will be of top quality features, and it also claimed that its customers will enjoy using the newly released Gionee Marathon M5 Enjoy.. Talking of its biggest selling point, the Gionee Marathon’s M5’s long battery life may be one of its top selling points because not many Smartphones in market have that battery capacity. The company has claimed that it optimized the battery to ensure that it doesn’t experience a drop in its capacity after some time. the company also claimed that the Marathon M5 Enjoy will still retain 90 percent of its original capacity even after being charged 600 times, making it possible to enjoy the long battery life for over 2 years without needing to make changes..

Gionee Marathon M5 Enjoy: 5.5-inch device with quad-core, 3GB RAM, fingerprint sensor, 5000 mAh battery but TFT screen; yours for $309. When Gionee Marathon M5 first came out, it catches the attention of everyone on the planet as where on earth can you find a smartphone with a whopping 6020 mAh battery. Now a new variant is out and it is called Marathon M5 Enjoy.. If there’s one thing that the Marathon series are good at – it is to solve the issue of having poor battery life in a smartphone. Remember back in the good old days of "dumb phones" where this issue never existed? Of course with the advent of smart devices with power-hungry hardware, powerful camera, always-on internet connection either via WiFi or 3G/4G – this problem starts to crop up. But with this kind of battery level, you are bound to have a couple of days, heck it can even reach almost a week of battery life if you are a casual user.. The Marathon M5 Enjoy comes in a body that measures at 155 x 76 x 9 mm (6.10 x 2.99 x 0.35 in) and weighs 200 g (7.05 oz). At best, it is averagely sized but weighs quite a handful. Then there’s the fingerprint sensor that is useful for biometric purpose as well as for taking pictures using the camera.. But if there’s one area of concern, it is on the screen part. This device has a 5.5-inch HD TFT capacitive touchscreen with 720 x 1280 pixels or ~267 ppi pixel density. Just when we thought the minimum these days are IPS, here comes Gionee to surprise us all. It is as we turn back the clock to 5 years ago. Is it some cost-cutting measure? Surely there are other ways to keep cost down, rather than providing users with TFT screen?. Under the hood of the Marathon, M5 Enjoy is the Mediatek MT6735 chipset with a Quad-core processor and 3GB RAM. Pretty decent performance although others is now moving to Octa-core and 4GB RAM. You can expect it to run most apps and games quite smooth. It won’t be that taxing as well, as it is only equipped with an HD screen, not even Full HD.. Camera-wise, there’s the 8MP-5MP camera setup that is just average. You will be able to capture good photos, and your selfies should look good as well. Regarding storage, the Marathon M5 Enjoy is having 16GB of internal storage that is sufficient enough to install your favorite apps and games. You can also further expand it up to 128GB via the microSD slot. Now you should be able to store all your videos, songs and much more in it.. On the operating system side of things, the Marathon M5 Enjoy is still on Android Lollipop 5.1. With Gionee not having a good reputation for coming up with updates, do not keep your hopes up high that this device will get an update to the latest Marshmallow 6.0.. As mentioned earlier, poor battery life should be a thing of the past as it has a highly capable Li-Po 5000 mAh battery. Do expect a couple of days or even close to a week before you need to start plugging it into recharge.. To round it up, this device does have 4G LTE connectivity and dual sim capability which adds a bit more to its value.. In summary, Gionee Marathon M5 Enjoy does what the Marathon series does best which is to provide users with great battery life. Other than that, things don’t seem to be too rosy. Poor TFT screen with HD-only resolution, a mismatch of Quad-core and 3GB RAM, 8MP primary camera are just some of the drawbacks. If you start to compare it with others in the same price range; pretty sure you will get better recommendation elsewhere.. The Gionee Marathon M5 Enjoy is currently available for approximately $309 USD. It is available in White and Gold..
