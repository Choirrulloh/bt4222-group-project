I bought this phone for my father. I charged it for 3 hours and then turned it on. And then navigated to camera to take selfie. The phone immediately crashed and would not turn on. And the phone started heating up. Luckily my dealer agreed to exchange the phone with a Samsung one! I did a big mistake by going for this phone by looking at the specs. But quality wise it is a big no!. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful. By Koppisetti Tarunsai | 30 Nov 2017.

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 16 GB + MicroSD. Low pixel density screen (282 ppi). The Gionee X1s comes with a 5.2-inch 720p display, 1.5 GHz quad-core processor, 3 GB of RAM, 16 GB of storage, a 13-megapixel main camera and a 16-megapixel front facing unit.. Dimensions: 5.92 x 2.89 x 0.35 inches (150.4 x 73.5 x 8.8 mm). Weight: 5.86 oz (166 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Features: Fingerprint (touch), Touch sensitive control keys. Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Quad-core, 1500 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video.

Good phones are getting cheaper and cheap phones are getting better. This is all credits to the Chinese manufacturers who have made drastic leaps forward. Today we have another Chinese mid-range smartphone, the Gionee X1S, with us which is bound to prove itself as an example of how cheap phones are getting better. Lets find out if this Rs. 19,999 smartphone is worth your money.. The Gionee X1S features a full metal body design. However, considering a metal body, the build isn’t the best I have seen in a budget smartphone. The phone suffers from the usual squeaks and creeks, hinting at a not so good build quality.. However, with slightly smaller display (5.2-inch), it feels right in hand for single hand use.. The Gionee X1S comes with a 5.2″ IPS LCD display. The resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your preference. If you prefer battery life and performance, you will love it. But if you prefer a sharper and crispier display, this might disappoint you, especially when comparing it with other smartphones of the same price range.. The display of the Gionee X1S is by no means bad or dull. The colors are decent, the viewing angles are good, and the brightness is acceptable. However, the minimum brightness doesn’t really suit night time users. They will be better off using apps like twilight or screen dimmer. There is a built-in smart eye protection option in the settings menu but it doesn’t dim the screen. It, however, blocks harmful blue light .. The Gionee X1S rocks a Quad-core MediaTek MT6735 SoC with a clock speed of 1.44GHz. The bad part here is it’s based on a power hogging 28nm architecture, which doesn’t help its battery life or the heat. The device’s processor is supported by 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage.. The phone is decently snappy and fast.. The HD display of the X1s also helps with the performance. All of the basic and social media apps run smoothly without hiccups. Even graphically demanding games run reasonably well. You will, however, end up with a really hot phone after gaming for some time. The 3GB of RAM helps with a little bit of multitasking and helps with a smooth experience altogether, although power users will end up with a salty experience.. I have never really been a fan of any Chinese smartphone’s UI. They are basically cluttered with their own set of half-baked apps and a lot of bloatware, and the Gionee X1S is no exception. But with a quick uninstallation of all the bloatware made me feel right at home. Again, if you happen to like the Chinese UI then you are all set to go, right out of the box.. The phone runs Android 7.0 Nougat with Amigo OS 4.0 on top. It comes with pre-installed apps like Gstore, theme park, mood wallpaper, mobile Anti-theft, child mode etc. which are pretty useless for me personally. The notification shade only shows you the notification. For quick shortcuts, you will have to swipe up to just like on the iPhones.. The lock screen is quite special as you get a set of 5 wallpapers that change every day. The fingerprint sensor on this phone is pretty fast but disappointingly enough, it doesn’t double as a multifunction button.. The front portion of the Gionee X1S is covered by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 that ends with a 2.5D curve. There are three capacitive keys at the bottom. There is also an LED notification alongside the 16MP front-facing camera.. The headphone jack of the device is located at the top and there is a microUSB port at the bottom. The right side consists of volume controls and the power button. All of your SIM and Micro SD slots sit at the left. Finally, at the back, you get the rear camera, dual-tone flash, and a fingerprint sensor.. Gionee claims its cameras to do wonders with the “super selfie” tagline and this device is no exception. The front camera of the Gionee X1S is a 16MP shooter which is accompanied by a front flash. It has an aperture of f/2.0 and a 1/3.1-inch sensor size to replicate plenty of details of the subject into the image. The primary camera takes some extraordinary pictures even in low light. The rear houses a 13MP camera placed right above the fingerprint sensor. It’s aided by dual tone LED flash. The secondary camera’s video recording caps out at 1080p.. The rear camera is okay-ish with good colors and details, and I have seen better camera lenses at the same price range. Low light images are a “meh” for me, with lots of noise and a loss in details.. The Gionee X1S comes with a dual SIM tray and a dedicated microSD expansion slot. It supports 4G along with other connectivity options like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB OTG. Sensor wise, it has compass, light, accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope.. The battery is probably Gionee X1S’ second best feature. This phone houses a huge 4,000 mAh battery which paired with a low 720p screen is a good combination for a better battery life. The downside here is the 28nm non-efficient SoC inside. The lack of optimization options has also hurt the battery. But all-in-all the battery life is still great.. The screen-on-time is around 5 hours under heavy usage. It takes me about 2 hours – 2 hours and 30 minutes to fully charge the battery. With the built-in battery saving modes, you will probably be able to gain more battery life. The standby time is, however, disappointing in this device. In some cases, the phone completely died on me overnight, even when I left it with 30% charge the night before. The Gionee X1S is priced at Rs 19,999, which makes it a budget-oriented smartphone. Considering the price, this device is one of the best I have used. The display, the camera, the battery, and the specifications of the device all together are decent considering the price. I have to say it offers a better selfie experience than what its competitors offer. The main downside is the build of the phone, although we have seen far worse in this price range.. This phone is overall a good value for the money if you want a good camera or a great battery life. But it might disappoint the heavy users and buyers with a keen eye for a sharp display..

Gionee X1 and Gionee X1s Specs and Price. By: NaijaTechGuide Team | In: Mobile Phones | Last Updated: 27th September 2017. Gionee X1 and X1s are affordable smartphones for users who desire features such as 4G LTE support, decent cameras and a fingerprint scanner. As one can easily guess, the X1s variant brings better specs to the table, including a faster processor and higher RAM.. Jumia Nigeria – See Offers | Jumia Kenya – See Offers. Gionee X1 & X1s Key Specs & Features. 5.0-inch or 5.2-inch IPS Display, 720 x 1280 pixels.

These phones do not digress from what you’d expect of a budget device in terms of build quality. While they are not shabby, they are nowhere near the most elegant. A measurement of 8.8 mm puts them somewhat on the thicker side. But then, you may not really complain, knowing how much you are paying.. Both the Gionee X1 and X1s come with HD (720 x 1,280 pixel) displays. While the standard variant rocks a 5-inch IPS panel, the latter sports a 5.2-incher. This means the X1 should offer slightly sharper images.. The Gionee X1s looks to provide better image quality. This is because it features a 13MP rear and 16MP front camera combo. It is safe to assume that the target segment for this one is that of selfie enthusiasts.. In its own case, the X1 offers 8MP sensors on both its front and back. It should perform well for an entry-level phone, judging by this setup.. Both devices come with quad-core MediaTek processors. But you can expect better performance from the Gionee X1s in that its CPU runs at 1.5 GHz and it features 3GB RAM. The regular model packs a 1.3GHz chip and 2GB RAM.. Internal storage for the two stands at 16 GB, expandable via a dedicated microSD card slot. The phones run on Android 7.0 Nougat operating system, which has Gionee’s Amigo 4.0 skin on top.. If you need an affordable phone you can lock with your fingerprint, these ones may not be a bad choice. You will find the scanner on the rear, below the main camera.. Gionee equips the X1 with a 3,000mAh battery, while the juicer on the X1s has a bigger 4,000mAh capacity. The phones support super fast 4G LTE with Voice over LTE (VoLTE) feature.. The Gionee X1 and X1s is targeted at the Indian market and is likely to sell in Nigeria, Kenya, or Ghana. The Price of the Gionee X1 in India is 8999 INR while Gionee X1s goes for 12999 INR..

My experience with this Gionee X1 is very bad. When you open the camera the display is having lots of dots in it. I just did a great mistake buying this X1. And sometimes the application I download gets automatically uninstall after I switched off the phone. I can't even exchange this X1 also in Flipkart or Amazon as this phone name option is not added in exchange list. I'm just regretting now why I brought this shit.
