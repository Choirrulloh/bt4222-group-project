ZenFone 3 is an agile, exquisite design inspired by the beauty of nature. A glass-and-metal wonder that captures the world with absolute clarity. An extraordinary smartphone for a life less ordinary. You’ve never felt diamond-like natural beauty with your whole hand. You’ve never felt precision-sculpted glass on both sides. You’ve never felt the aesthetic joy of Zen’s signature concentric-circle pattern, or the tactile excitement of spun-cut etchings. All this because you’ve never felt ZenFone 3. It’s time your senses felt exquisite design. ZenFone 3 is the definition of refined craftsmanship. Encased in contoured Corning Gorilla Glass and tapering to a thin 6.16mm edge, ZenFone 3 has a fluid, multi-dimensional design that’s finished with a diamond-cut chamfer. To hold ZenFone 3 is to appreciate a contemporary work of art — the passion of imagination realized.. 5.8 x 2.9 x 0.3 inches. 1.15 pounds ( View shipping rates and policies ). #17,007 in Cell Phones & Accessories ( See Top 100 in Cell Phones & Accessories ). #340 in Cell Phones & Accessories > Unlocked Cell Phones.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars Good, while it lasts... I love the Asus Zenfone series and just upgraded to the Zenfone 3 ULTRA (6.8") edition for better speakers and bigger screen. The Zenfone 3 5.2" ZE520KL is a good phone, if a bit small for my likes. THE GOOD: It is FAST, has amazing reliability, takes awesomely hi-res photos, and fits in your pocket. THE BAD: less than 1 year after buying the phone, it began to slow down, then the top right corner (clock area) of the screen started to turn yellow. It more frequently required a full reboot of the phone daily to speed it up. DISCLAIMER: I initially wanted the 6.8" ULTRA, but the price was too high at the time. I thought I was getting the 5.5" Zenfone 3 when I ordered this and - since no returns are allowed - I kept the smaller one just because it would be a major hassle to try and return the 5.2: for a 5.5" and then start all over again with a new phone so soon.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars and I love its sound quality and volume. I have used it for a week, and I love its sound quality and volume, camera, fingerprint sensor, screen, design and how fast it gets charge. On the other side, the battery could survive until the end of the day if you don't play a lot of games. Also, the charger and the earbuds are very good. I totally recommend this product, because it is affordable and has a great quality and performance.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great budget phone with flagsship phone qualities.. The phone quality is top notch, everything about it screams premium phone. It can handle everything you throw at it. It has really great cameras, pictures are crisp and vibrant, also takes 4k video. Battery life is fair after heavy use, video streaming, social networking and heavy gaming. The phone does not over heat like previous ones I have owned. It is upgradeable to android 7.0. I came from Sony Xperia Z3 plus to this phone, pretty much same specs and quality. As I previously wrote, this is a great phone for the price. One year up date: The phone still works how it should. Even bought my wife one 5 months ago she also loves the phone. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Asus is a great company and always have fantastic quality products. Have had this phone for about 5 months now. The reason I bought it was because of the brand, Asus is a great company and always have fantastic quality products. Everything is great about this phone for the price; great cameras, build quality and look. I trusted Asus because I've bought motherboards from them before. Also one of the biggest things for me about this phone is that there is NO BLOATWARE, unlike Samsung phones. There are a few preinstalled apps but nothing that really gets in your face and pisses you off like other brands. The UI looks nice as well. Makes you feel kinda unique because you're using a phone brand that barely anyone else uses, but I am so glad that I found this brand of phones. I will be sticking with Asus for phones from now on because of this phone.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent phone, very high quality and bright screen. Excellent phone, very high quality and bright screen, camera shoots in 4k is a huge plus, expandable memory and internal 32GB means I will never have to worry! Only down side is no Name Brand phone protectors yet so you'll have to trust some other company. 5.2'' screen is nice, hardly noticeable from my 5.5'' zenfone 2 i had before. The all glass / metal design makes me much more confident in its durability and it has proven true the past few months I've had it. Very quick phone as well, would highly recommend. Definitely worth the few extra dollars over the zenfone 2.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars ... it for about 2 months now and it is great. I have used it for about 2 months now and it is great. My preferred characteristic is that the battery will last me through a whole day (about 18 hours) with normal web, camera and texting use.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars HOLY SMACKARUNEZ.... All I can say is wow! It's in a class all to itself! Like the iPhone Samsung galaxy it's the ASUS ZENFONE HOLY SMACKERONIES... GET THE PHONE YOU WONT BE DISAPOINTED!. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Solid phone, well-executed features, good price,. I love how well this phone holds on to a signal whenever I am in a call. Once I get connected to a call, I seem to be locked onto it. Call clarity is better than my old iPhone 6s. Texting, using the phone's messaging app, is simple but functional though a tad boring. Battery life is very good and can last the whole day from 100% charge at 7AM with heavy wifi and data use, streaming videos, phone calls (2-3 hours total) and heavy texting and Ill still have around 55%-63% battery by 9PM. Camera is just ok and nothing special though the manual mode is fun to use! The ASUS ZenUi is actually pretty interesting and the so-called "bloatware" can easily be disabled or uninstalled. What I am nervous about is the glass on the back of the phone which is cool to look at but in my opinion, an unnecessary embellishment. Overall a solid phone if you're after speed, stability, and signal.. Was this review helpful to you?. Lol..n for the price..you can't beat it..all my friends keep asking me. What kinda phone is that😂😂😂😂its my kinda Phone 😊😊. 5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome!!. Bad phone, I don't recommend it. Everything comes in Chinese, some applications that come with the phone are Chinese only. 1.0 out of 5 stars Bad phone, I don't recommend it. Very good phone and tough build quality even compared to more expensive flagship and it games well, I'm able to run asphalt extreme comfortably but mine came with an issue,... 5.0 out of 5 stars Best bang for buck. I use on US AT&T network and works perfect.. 5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent. Phone was not compatible with 4G or LTE on Cricket. 3.0 out of 5 stars Phone was not compatible with 4G or LTE on Cricket .... i love it but you have to check compatible bands for mobile carrier i had some issue with supported bands and i switched to another carrier. 5.0 out of 5 stars really good phone. i love it but you have to .... Have it for a week now and Battery life is great so far .. Features on point camera on point Great buy. 4.0 out of 5 stars ... it for a week now and Battery life is great so far.

I would certainly tell that if Zenfone 3 used an AMOLED display, the results would even more surprising. And well, it could be gone even better if the battery capacity had been increased to 3000 mAh at least. Nevertheless, Zenfone 3 battery life is much satisfying as compared to other smartphones offering a 3000 mAh battery. Single Review, online available, Short, Date: 09/05/2016. ASUS Zenfone 3 (ZE520KL) Hands-on Images Source: Mobygyaan If we talk about the pricing, Zenfone 3 is available at â¹21,999 while the Chinese flagships such as Xiaomi Mi 5 and LeEco Le Max 2 are very close competitors offering more performance and features with similar price. Having said that specifications is not the only thing to see while seeing the prices, itâs the overall experience with the device that matters at the end. Single Review, online available, Very Short, Date: 09/01/2016. 70% Asus ZenFone 3 ZE520KL Review Source: Think Digit At Rs. 27,999, the Asus Zenfone 3 is not the best smartphone to buy for those looking for a whole package. You can consider this smartphone for its battery, and even the camera is above average, but as a complete smartphone, the Zenfone 3 is well behind the OnePlus 3 and LeEco Le Max 2.

So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. In the notebook sector, Asus had a global market share of about 11% from 2014-2016, making it the fourth largest laptop manufacturer. In the smartphone sector, Asus is not among the Top 5 and has only a small market share (as of 2016).. Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro ZD552KL Adreno 506. Asus ZenFone Zoom S ZE553KL Adreno 506.

ASUS ZenFone 3 (ZE520KL/ZE552KL): Pricing and Specs in the Philippines. Following the ASUS Philippines Zenvolution event, the much-anticipated ZenFone 3 is now on the market and ready for purchase.. The ASUS ZenFone 3 is now available in the Philippines. The official launch has confirmed the pricing as well for the much-anticipated line of ZenFone phones coming from ASUS' Zenvolution event.. ASUS has come a long way since the original ZenFone, which came out just a scant two years ago. The ZenFone was an entry-level smartphone and ASUS' first foray into the smartphone market, but it was not too well-received due to an overall lack of performance, poor quality components like a bad battery and overheating. Since then, the Taiwanese company struck back with the much more attractive and capable ZenFone 2, and now the successor is here the ZenFone 3.. The ZenFone 3 comes in two variants: a 5.2-inch version and a 5.5-inch one, both with Full HD 1080p Super IPS+ displays covered by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. They come equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, LTE Cat.6 connectivity, a 16-megapixel f/2.0 main camera and an 8-megapixel f/2.0 front camera with laser autofocus, and a 3,000mAh battery. The ZenFone 3 also comes with a fingerprint reader, and they run Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow.. As is becoming more standard these days, the phones support Dual SIM capability (one micro, one nano), come with USB Type-C, and have the usual fixtures such as USB OTG support, gyroscope, e-compass, accelerometer, proximity sensor, light sensor, 3.5mm jack, 5-magnet loudspeaker and ASUS' sound-enhancing ZonicMaster 3.0 technology.. The smaller version with the smaller specs starts at PHP16,995, while the larger phablet-sized variant is PHP18,995. They come in Moonlight White, Shimmer Gold, Aqua blue and Sapphire Black color options. The phone has a spun metal finish on its metallic back plate, but it's covered by a glass back for further aesthetics.. Although the ZenFone 3 is considerably more expensive than its predecessors the ZenFone and the ZenFone 2, ASUS managed to pack a lot more into this package in addition to creating a really fine-looking body. The design is very impressive and quite elegant, although some people will be put off by the fragile-looking glass. Still, ASUS managed to put together a mid-range phone that has some incredible hardware inside for a ridiculously good price.. ASUS ZenFone 3 ZE520KL: Top-end Features a Budget Pricing.

Asus Zenfone 3 Price, Review and Spe scifications. The Zenfone 3 lies at the base of the new Zenfone Stack. The new Zenfone family gets a design refresh and steer clear of Intel's Atom processors. The Zenfone 3 is powered by Snapdragon 625 octa core processor, which is perhaps the first mid-range SoC based on power efficient FinFet 14nm process node. The performance cores are clocked at 2.0 GHz, which means it's faster than Snapdragon 617 which it aims to replace. It will be available in two variants with 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage and 4GB RAM, 64GB storage - Both of which will flaunt metal sandwitched between 2.5D Gorilla Glass front glass front and glass back. On the rear, you will find a 16MP rear camera sensor protruding beyond the 7.7 mm thick casing, and flanked by Laser AF and dual tone flash modules. The camera also includes 4-axis optical image stabilization, phase detection AF and F2.0 aperture lens. The front 8MP camera too has a F2.0 aperture lens. Camera specifications feel mighty, but as is the thing with camera specs, they say very little about the actual camera experience at user end. The Zen UI on new Zenfones is based on Android Marshmallow and benefits from a design overhaul as well. Other features include 4G LTE with VoLTE, Hybrid Dual SIM card tray, USB Type C port and 3000 mAh battery. Of course the Zenfone 3 isn't skimping on specs, but how much value it offers for your money shall be discernible only after its India launch. I am sure it's being desperately awaited by many. Asus Zenfone 3 India availability and price is merely a subject of speculation as of today.. Premium metal - glass construction Powerful chipset Good camera hardware Full HD IPS+ display.

Connectivity Battery Light Weight Craftsmanship Design Standard Fast Fingerprint Scanner Faster Charging Time Camera with 4K Recording Touch is Smooth and Fast Bloatware Slippery in Hands Average Battery Verdict. Asus – The name is popular for categories like motherboards, laptops, tablets, Displays, Networking products is leaping into the smartphone market with stylish and photography oriented devices. In May 2016 the company launched Asus Zenfone Max which is a battery monster making possible 2 days continuous use of the device without charging the battery.. But well, have to accept everything. The Asus Zenfone Max is average at camera performance since every brand is focussing on the DSLR-like image snappers in their phones. Recently, Oppo and Huawei launched photography oriented handsets, both of these are worthy of their design and features. Now coming to the Asus, the company is launched 3 devices with next-generation photography features. Meet, the Asus Zenfone 3, one of the three smartphones which are Deluxe and Ultra. Here is a detailed review of the Zenfone 3 ZE520KL from my 4 days continuous usage.. I think Asus has now turned a massive design change with the Zenfone 3 series. Coming to the Zenfone 3 it has superior build quality comparing with the similar price range of devices. The device builds with All-Metal and Glass body with sleek looks. Zenfone 3 is easy for single handed operation with a 2.1mm slim bezel body.. Coming to the design part, the device has sleek bezels and a steel metal line running through the edge of the panel. It is similar to the Apple 6 series, but the designer is managed to change its looks completely from both front and back sides.. The device holds a premium look in the hand; it is one of the beautiful device available in the market. With the design, Asus kept it simple and you can say simply WOW. The company is also introduced a term ‘invisible antenna’ with Zenfone 3 series. The antenna is almost invisible when you see the skeleton of the device inside. Technically it is a step towards new technology.. Build Quality of the device is strong, and the company hasn’t compromised on the design. The front side of the device consists of a speaker at the top followed by proximity sensors and front camera. The display of the device is 5.2-inch FHD screen with contoured Corning Gorilla Glass protection, at the bottom, you will see physical buttons for navigation. On the rear side, the device has a Camera bump, LED Flash, and a fingerprint scanner. At the rear bottom, you will see Asus logo for branding.. The foremost attraction of the new Asus Zenfone 3 is primarily the design and build quality. Perhaps, the user needs to take care about the device when operating single handed. The device is too slippery in hands; I strongly suggest a good bumper or rugged case protect this beauty from bumps and scratches.. The display of the Asus Zenfone 3 is bright and packed with 1920×1080 full high definition FHD and 600nits brightness technology. The display is built with Super IPS+ display, the quality of the display is closer to the Amoled.. It has excellent color reproduction, great viewing angles and brightness levels are good even in daylight. I tested the display in various lighting conditions and results are pretty good in all. It has a 77.3% screen to body ratio, which means you will feel big display and less body experience.. For display, Asus used Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. We have no complaints with the quality of the display used in Zenfone 3 and we appreciate the efforts done by the company for crafting beautiful device at a budget friendly price.. While coming to the hardware section of the Zenfone 3, the. Snapdragon 625 Octa-core Processor holding the device with a clock speed of. The eight core processor is far enough to run the Pokemon Go and Asphalt games as we have tested earlier. Without heating too much, the device manages to provide a great gaming experience on high-graphic games. 3GB RAM joins the CPU to empower multi-tasking performance of the Zenfone 3. The combination is well known for its ability to provide good performance as well as the uninterrupted multi-tasking.. The gaming capabilities of the smartphone are enhanced by the Adreno. It will be a great experience to have a gaming session on the Zenfone 3 which is also equipped with a 1920 x 1080 HD display. After having an Asphalt session on the smartphone, we can really recommend this to you if you are a hard-core gamer. The 2600mAh battery surprised us by letting us playback an outstanding 16 hours of videos. We had enjoyed multiple movies and animations in all this testing period.. To store all of your important data, there is a 32GB ROM available on Zenfone 3 which could be later upgraded up to 256GB via micro SD card. But, for a smartphone worth $300+ the Asus should’ve included a little more internal storage. We may expect it in the upcoming variants.. As we mentioned before, the camera of the Asus Zenfone 3 is average. Even it is saying the back camera is of. while having some shoot in high brightness conditions, we don’t feel like so. For a company which produced great camera smartphones like Zenfone Zoom , we expected a little more clarity in the camera. But, they made sure to include all other essential features like Laser Phase Detection Autofocus, Optical Image Stabilization with 4 axis, dual LED and dual tone flash. Here are some back camera examples to have a visual examination. The next generation PixelMaster 3.0 feature is added in the device, it captures the images really fast and steady in just 0.03 seconds.. The front shooter is comparatively good with an. 8.0 MP sensors, aperture f/2.0 and 1080p resolution. There is a bunch of options available to enhance the selfie without depending an extra photo editor. Have a look at the front camera samples.. While talking about the video capturing of the product, it can record 4K videos and 1080p high definition clips @ 30fps which are not too bad in performance. After a couple of hours of the testing process, we found that the video taking capability of the Zenfone 3 is good but not too average. Especially in shaky conditions, the sensor failed to capture stabilized videos. Even smaller and cheaper devices have a better video stabilization feature, a company like Asus should’ve included an even better camera on a flagship device. For you, here is a video sample was taken from the Asus Zenfone 3.. The User Interface of the Asus Zenfone 3 is average when compared to the other Zenfone series. Another good feature to notice on this smartphone is Zen UI shortcuts to access the camera and directly have a picture. Users could double tap the fingerprint sensor to open the camera and single tap to take a picture. All in all, regarding the camera, the Zenfone 3 is average but not too bad. When comparing with the previous Asus models, you could feel a little disappointed with this camera features provided in Zenfone 3.. Zenfone 3 is running on the. Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow overlayed by the Zen UI 3.0 with a couple more features than the previous Zen UI releases. There is a lot of small improvements in the OS alongside some big ones. For example, double tapping the home screen will activate the Single Hand mode, customizable gestures, and a couple more camera shortcuts as mentioned before. At the first look to the improvements, we could see Asus have mostly concentrated on improving the User-experience of the Zen UI. As far as my personal experience the Zen UI has its pros and cons, if you are a pure Android fanboy, you may disappoint with the Bloatware comes with Zen. But the company is managed to tweak the Android in a decent way; the average user will get satisfaction with the tweaked OS. I found few apps which are pre-loaded with the device; we commonly name as bloatware. Here are the apps which I found in Zenfone 3. Mobile Manager feature lets you clean up the Zenfone very fast, and we found it as a good replacement for many third party applications. It can replace the apps like Power Saver, Cleaning apps, and a security app. Using the same app, users could. clean up apps that spam their notifications, apps. that start on boot, apps that take too many permissions, or apps that eat too much mobile data. The Easy mode and Kids mode are also noticeable among the improvements.. The Zen UI got many performance improvements also. From our tests the device performs very well and the apps get installed even faster when compared to the previous devices. Internet surfing also good even on slower connections. The previous models had a little heating issue. which is also solved in Zenfone 3.. The connectivity of the Zenfone 3 is horse powered by the 4G LTE. As mentioned before, the internet browsing seems to be improved in this device where the video streaming is blazing fast. We couldn’t find the buffering icon other than the beginning of the video. All other connectivity solutions including Wifi, Bluetooth is there on this. I tested the call connectivity and signal strength for 3 days. The device is good to grasp signal in any place as far the least tower signal is available. I went to a place where the signal is hardly reached by the phone. Even at single bar signal strength, the device holds the connectivity with the signal tower and connectivity and quality of the call is good. The invisible antenna is performing well even in a bad signal condition.. Sweetening the security features, a Fingerprint reader is there on the smartphone which provides an extra layer of security to the users. As we found in many other devices, it is placed on the backside this time. The phone also supports, PIN lock, pattern lock along with fingerprint scanner to unlock the device. If you still want more, the Laser included for the autofocus can also measure the distance in critical conditions. The fingerprint scanner is fast and unlocks your device is less than second. Type-C connector also joins the connectivity section.. Last but not the least the Battery performance. The Zenfone 3 is packed with a 2600mAh which is an average performer.. The device is managed to give a full day usage under normal usage conditions. If you are a gaming maniac, expect less backup time from the device. For a full charge, the device is taking 50-60 minutes, you can improve the charging time. by enabling the Aeroplane mode while charging.. As always, there are no defects in this Asus product also other than some small cons. If you are going to buy the Zenfone 3 for the image taking purposes, we are not that confident to recommend this product to you. Even it managed to deliver good camera, it is not enough for a real shooter. Regarding performance, the Asus Zenfone 3 is a rock star. The solid hardware including a Snapdragon processor and 3GB. RAM never failed to satisfy us in our long and continuous testing sessions. The gaming experience also made a great impression in our mind.. Connectivity also looks good as it comes with a Hybrid sim slot. Super IPS+ technology with the protection of Gorilla Glass 3. All in all, the Asus Zenfone 3 which currently priced Rs. 21999 ($328) is a good choice you can make in the mid-range category.. Asus Zenfone 3 ZE520KL Review – Decent Mid-Range Performer.

Ketan Pratap , 30 August 2016. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Asus ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) has been priced at Rs. It will directly take on the OnePlus 3. Gadgets 360 rates the phone 8 out of 10. Asus unveiled its first ZenFone range of smartphones back in 2014 ,. the budget and mid-range segments in India. With the second-generation of models , Asus followed the same strategy but didn't quite achieve the same level of success in India thanks to stronger competition.. In 2016, Asus has a different plan for the ZenFone 3 range. This time around, the Taiwanese company wants to compete with brands such as Apple and Samsung in the high-end segment. Peter Chang, Region Head, South Asia and Country Manager for Asus India has confirmed to Gadgets 360 that the company is looking to increase its market share in the premium segment.. Asus has launched multiple models in the ZenFone 3 generation , namely the 5.2-inch ZenFone 3 (ZE520KL) priced at Rs. 21,999; the 5.5-inch ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) at Rs. 27,999; the ZenFone 3 Ultra (ZU680KL) at Rs. 49,999; the ZenFone 3 Laser (ZC551KL) at Rs. The most premium model, named ZenFone 3 Deluxe (ZS570KL) , is available priced at Rs. 49,999 with a Special Edition variant priced at Rs. We got the 5.5-inch Asus ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) for review in Shimmer Gold. The smartphone will also be available in Moonlight White, Aqua Blue, and Sapphire Black.. The ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) sports an all-new design which is different from its predecessors, as well as impressive innards. But will it be enough to allow Asus to break free of its "budget brand" tag and break into a different league, where it will have to take on some heavyweights? We try to find out in our review.. Look and feel At a time when almost every second smartphone launched in India sports an all-metal design, the ZenFone 3 is a refreshing change. Asus has used 2.5D curved Corning Gorilla Glass both on the front and rear, which makes the device look elegant. The Taiwanese company's signature concentric-circle pattern at the rear dubbed "Zen design" looks classy and we like it a lot. During our review period, we received several questions from people about the handset, because of its interesting look.. The glass on the front and rear are held by a metal frame which feels sturdy. The rounded sides made gripping the handset easy. We have to commend Asus for its attention to detail. The rear has no visible antenna bands; instead they run along the bottom and top.. The 5.5-inch display dominates the front, and you'll also see the earpiece, standard sensors, and a front camera. Asus has used capacitive Back, Home, and Recents buttons which are placed right below the display. They responded well at all times, and our only complaint is that they are not backlit, which meant that we were often fumbling to find them in the dark.. At 7.69mm thick and 155 grams in weight, the ZenFone 3 is not the slimmest or lightest smartphone available in the market. Due to the use of glass on both the front and rear, the ZenFone 3 is slightly slippery and we preferred using it with both hands for a better grip, but we were never too uncomfortable with it. We also wish that the protruding rear camera had been flush with the back panel as we were afraid during our entire review period that the lens might get scratched. Asus however claims that a sapphire lens on the ZenFone 3 will provide protection from any type of scratch.. The rear sports the primary camera accompanied by an LED flash, and also the fingerprint scanner which is placed just below the camera. There is an Asus logo near the bottom. The right packs power as well as volume buttons while the left side is where you'll find the hybrid SIM slot. The bottom has the USB Type-C port as well as a speaker grille and microphone. The 3.5mm audio jack is on top.. Asus says that the handset has a 77.3 percent screen-to-body ratio. The 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920-pixel) IPS display on the ZenFone 3 is incredibly sharp, and it's a treat to watch videos and play games on this display. At 401ppi and with a brightness rating of 600nits, the display is vibrant and offers rich colours. During our review, we were completely satisfied with its performance. We had no issues with sunlight legibility, and viewing angles impressed us too. A blue light filter makes the display more comfortable to use at night.. Display settings can be controlled using Asus's Splendid app. The display also supports touch recognition through gloves. We tested the feature during our review and the display responded well even when used with gloves on, which is good for people in areas where winters get really cold.. Specifications The Asus ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) packs a 64-bit octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor clocked at 2GHz with integrated Adreno 506 graphics, as well as 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM. There is 64GB of inbuilt storage and support for microSD cards of up to 2TB for expansion. Asus is also offering 100GB of free cloud storage space for two years, in collaboration with Google.. The hybrid SIM slot supports one Nano-SIM and one Micro-SIM or microSD card. Asus notes that both SIM cards support 3G and 4G networks but only one SIM card can connect to 3G/4G networks at a time.. The phone is powered by a non-removable 3000mAh battery, which supports fast charging. There's a 16-megapixel rear camera with f/2.0 aperture, 6P Largan lens, and dual-LED real tone flash. Asus has used Sony's IMX298 camera sensor on the ZenFone 3. There is also an 8-megapixel front-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture. The rear camera uses Asus' new TriTech auto-focus technology which Asus dedscribes as a combination of laser, phase detection and continuous auto-focus modes.. The handset sports a 5-magnet speaker at the bottom which Asus says can deliver up to 40 percent better performance than previous ZenFone models. Connectivity options include Bluetooth, Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n/ac, GPS/A-GPS, and Glonass.. The Asus ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) runs the company's new ZenUI 3.0 which looks like a complete makeover compared to the first generation ZenFones. The new interface looks clean and sports real-time animated weather and clock widgets; new wallpaper motion effects, and an all-new Theme Store from which users can download free as well as paid themes, wallpapers, icons, and ringtones.. Some of the neat additions to the interface include ZenMotion, which consists of various touch and motion gestures. There's also a one-handed mode that basically shrinks the display to one corner of the screen for easy access. Users have to first enable the One Hand Mode. Once done, double-tapping the home key triggers the mode. We found the feature functional and it came in handy when we were on the move.. To customise the home screen, you can swipe upwards from the bottom of the display to launch the Manage Home. page which includes several options such as Apps & Widgets (to add new apps or widgets to home screen), Home edit (for changing the icon size, scroll effect, and font), Wallpapers, Icon Packs, ZenUI Theme and Lock Apps (which allows you to lock certain apps). The dropdown notifications shade packs the standard toggles for various settings.. An app called Mobile Manager offers to free RAM and storage space as well as check performance and app permissions. We especially liked some animations added for minor functions like the in-built RAM cleaner that showed a meter with the amount of RAM. While setting up the phone, Asus offered a really handy way to download commonly used apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat. This feature definitely saved us some time.. Overall, the new ZenUI version looks clean and comes with some nice utility functions. But we wish Asus had reduced the number of preloaded apps on the phone. There is still a plethora of Asus branded apps some of which might never be used, including PhotoCollage, Do It Later, Share Link, ZenFone Care, ZenTalk, Laser Ruler, Quick Memo, Splendid, Puffin, ZenCircle, ZenFlash camera, and MyAsus Service Centre. Camera The camera app on the ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) is quick and really easy to use. The 16-megapixel rear camera has an f/2.0 aperture and 6P Largan lens, and uses the company's TriTech auto-focus technology which combines laser, phase detection and continuous autofocus. Asus claims that the device can focus in just 0.03 seconds in all conditions, and during our usage, we did find that the camera focused really quickly.. Some other camera features like optical image stabilisation (OIS) and electronic image stabilisation (EIS) are nice features and come in handy for taking still shots and videos respectively. We were however surprised to see the default camera resolution set at 12 megapixels rather than 16 megapixels. One can however change the resolution from the camera app's settings.. Pictures taken indoors were excellent, with a great amount of detail and accuracy, thanks to the second-generation laser autofocus technology which comes into play. Outdoor shots were also decent with vibrant colours, and didn't lose detail when zoomed in. The low-light shots from the primary camera were decent as well though we noticed some noise at the edges. As we kept taking more shots at night, we realised that the ZenFone 3 isn't the best choice for low-light shots. In some shots, we saw grain and loss of detail.. (Tap to see full-sized Asus ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) camera samples). The dual-LED real-tone flash managed to light objects well in pitch-dark situations. One of the biggest highlights of the ZenFone 3 has to be the support for 4K videos. The camera can also record videos at full-HD and HD resolutions.. The 8-megapixel front camera on the ZenFone 3 took sharp images and definitely surprised us with its quality. Selfies were clean with a decent amount of detail. The low-light results were also not bad. There are several tweaking options including Beautification for enhanced selfies. The front camera can record videos at full-HD resolution.. There are a plethora of camera modes to choose from. HDR mode expands the dynamic range and enhances detail from high-contrast scenes; Low Light mode enhances light sensitivity for clearer and brighter low-light shots; Manual mode offer DSLR-like camera settings; Real Time Beautification mode applies multiple facial enhancements even before you press the shutter button; Super Resolution mode is claimed to take composite images at up to 4X resolution, and Night mode slows the shutter speed allowing clearer still shots.. At its launch event, Asus claimed that Super Resolution mode is a unique feature of the ZenFone 3. The images we took in this mode had a bit more detail and less noise than regular ones. We were impressed with shots that were taken with HDR mode enabled as well.. We had fun using the GIF animation mode which basically captures a series of images and converts them into a GIF animation. The ZenFone 3 also supports Timelapse and Slow Motion videos.. Performance The ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) handled multi-tasking with ease. The octa-core Snapdragon 625 processor didn't give us any reason to complain regarding performance in daily usage. Apps launched with ease and jumping from one to another was amazingly fast. We had a great time playing games on the ZenFone 3 and never faced frame rate drops while playing games like Need for Speed: No Limits. The 5.5-inch screen is also great for photos, videos and games.. We were definitely impressed with the quick response of the fingerprint sensor. The best part was that it recognised our fingerprints even with wet fingers and we never had to try more than once to unlock the handset.. During our usage, we didn't face any call drops because of handset issues. The network connectivity on the ZenFone 3 was particularly good, and with 4G, it managed to offer decent download speeds. We were impressed with its capability to hold on to weak Wi-Fi signals. With the inclusion of USB Type-C, the ZenFone 3 supports fast file transfers.. The single speaker placed on the bottom was loud and offered less distortion compared to other smartphones. We however preferred to use headphones, and the bundled ones offered decent bass with clear reproduction.. AnTuTu returned a score of 38,250, while Quadrant produced 36,818. GFXBench and 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme produced 24fps and 8,143 points respectively.. Battery Life The ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) packs a non-removable 3000mAh battery that ran for 13 hours and 45 minutes in our video loop test, which is good. With light to medium usage, the ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) easily managed to last through a day with over 40 percent left at the end. We made some calls as well as used apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Twitter, and streamed music while running other everyday tasks. We also used the camera occasionally.. Things however got worse with heavy usage when we tried gaming, watching videos on YouTube and recording 4K videos, and we had to charge our unit twice in a day. While recording 4K videos, we noticed a considerable amount of heat around the back. Both of these are in line with expectations.. This was mitigated to some extent thanks to the quick-charging support. Asus claims that with just 5 minutes of charging, the handset can deliver up to 2 hours of talk time. We noticed that the ZenFone 3 took around 90 minutes to charge fully from zero, and we easily got to the 30-40 percent charge level in just 20 minutes, which is handy.. 27,999, the Asus ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) smartphone directly competes with the OnePlus 3 ( Review ), which has received rave reviews and is one of our current recommendations. The ZenFone 3 will have a tough fight ahead of it in the Indian market, but this phone scores a lot in terms of design and display quality.. Considering that the ZenFone 3 will be available online and offline, Asus can reach a broader audience than before. For those who are looking for a phone that offers great design, and who would prefer ZenUI over stock Android, the ZenFone 3 definitely is a contender.. For those looking for alternatives apart from the OnePlus 3 , the Xiaomi Mi 5 ( Review ) is also an option and is now available at a lower price..

They have given us a vast majority of good smartphones that always brought something new to the table like the Zenfone 2, Zenfone Zoom and Zenfone Max. Their phone always had well balanced specs with good design and a specific focus area for a particular phone. This was they case for all their phones until recently when they brought the Zenfone 3 to the Indian market. This time the major focus was on design and user experience with high end material and major focus on design and build quality. This resulted in Higher prices than your usual phone and lets find out if its worth your money with our Asus Zenfone 3 ZE520KL Review.. Asus released multiple variants of the Zenfone 3 this year, there are two variants of Zenfone 3, then another two of Zenfone 3 Deluxe and then there is Zenfone 3 Ultra. You get a vast number of devices to chose from which on you want to buy. The One I have with me is the Zenfone 3 ZE520KL which is the 5.2 inch variant of the device and comes with 3 GB Ram and 32 GB of internal storage.. Earlier all the Zenfone that we have seen has either been made out of plastic, leather, metal or a mix of all three. Asus took a different approach this time with the Zenfone 3 and its a beauty to look at. The Glass and Metal Body of the Phone with its new design looks excellent and its a major improvement in terms of build quality of the phone.. The Front and Rear of the Zenfone 3 is covered with Gorilla Glass 3 underneath which Asus has added a hairline spun metal concentric circle pattern which they called is a reminiscent of the water ripples of a pond, indicating the focus on the Zen Design elements of the device. It looks great under certain lighting and is quite different from what we have seen in any other phones yet. Both front and back have a curved glass panel that blends in with the frame of the device giving it nice smooth finish.. The Frame of the device is made out of aluminum alloy and has finely sandblasted surface finish with the Gorilla Glass edges blending in with the curve of the frame. On the front, there is a 5.2-inch 1080p display which gives the screen a Screen to body ratio of 77.3 %. The phone is compact and easy to hold and I didn’t think at first if the 5.2-inch screen would suite my style but after a while, I felt more comfortable with its size.. Just above the screen of the Zenfone 3, their is a 8 MP front facing camera along with the proximity sensor. Just like earlier Zenfone, there are 3 capacitive buttons at the bottom of the phone for controlling the phone, and just like older models they are not backlit. I really wished that the buttons were backlit but its not a deal breaker any way. The volume rocker and the power buttons are placed on the right hand side and offer a great feedback while using them. They also have a nice texture to them which helps with the overall design of the phone and improves the buttons usability.. On the left side of the device, their is a hybrid sim card tray that can take either two sim card or a micro SD card along with a sim card. On the bottom of the device, their is a USB C port for charging and data syncing. This is the first Zenfone to come with a USB C port and it is good that Asus jumped on board with the upgraded USB standard.. The only down side of the design is the glossy back of the phone with is Zen design. Its is no doubtly one of the best-designed smartphones we have ever seen but there is a downside of its glossy glass back and that is the phone is a fingerprint magnet. You can easily see fingerprints on the back of the phone with a few minutes of use in your hand. The other thing on the back of the phone is its primary 16 MP camera. The camera sits on the top of the phone and is coved with Sapphire glass. Alongside the camera, there are LED flash and the laser autofocus and just underneath it is the Fingerprint sensor.. The phone measures at 146.87 x 73.98 x 7.69 making it a slim phone for its segment. The phone weights in at 144 gram which along with its design and build quality makes the phone both look and fell premium and well built.. Asus Zenfone 3 ZE520KL comes with Asus ZenUI 3.0 which runs on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow and features many custom Asus features over the vanilla version of Android. Some might like the added feature and UI changes and some might not, it really depends on how you use the device. I personally did enjoy most part of ZenUI and like some of its added features such as Touch gestures and Asus Mobile Manager. Its makes using the device easy for most people.. The phone does come with some bloat ware installed which can easily be removed if you want to. Asus added a bunch of features to change the look of UI according to what you might prefer with custom icon packs , wallpapers, themes and much more all of which can be downloaded from their store. There is a full range of gestures and shortcuts built into the device that includes drawing letters to quickly launch apps to double tapping to go into one hand mode.. Asus added a new app this time with the Zenfone 3 called Game Genie which as the name suggest is designed to help while you are playing games.It allows you to boost the game you are playing and even record the screen to capture the gameplay, you can even live stream the gameplay to your YouTube or Twitch accounts.. Overall the software of phone adds more and more features that some people might not need or there might be a google alternative of it, but for most of the people these features makes it easier to use the device and the overall UI doesn’t feel heavy at all.. The Asus Zenfone 3 ZE520KL is packed with a Snapdragon 625 Octa-core processor running at 2 GHz along with Adreno 506 GPU. Asus took a more balanced approach with the processor this time and instead of going with the much more powerfull Snapdragon 820 they went with the 625 which consumes less battery and doesn’t heat up compared to 820. The processor is paired with 3 GB of Ram and it does very well on regular use. The phone feels nice and responsive for the most part and I haven’t had any lag while using the device, multitasking app switching all were great and Zenfone 3 handled it very well.. We ran a couple of benchmark on the device and noticed that the phone didn’t scored well and the benchmark was similar to the Redmi Note 3 and other phones in the category.On Antutu the Zenfone 3 ZE520KL score around 62000, while in the Vellamo Multicore benchmark it scored around 2240.. We than ran the Geekbench test to see if the processor of the phone is really lacking the much needed performance it should have shown in the benchmark and were surprised to see that while the phone scored just around 800 in single core performance but a good 4055 in multi-core. Comparing that to LeEco Le2 which scored 1465 in Single core but just 2564 in Multicore, proves one thing with this phone and that is its have a good multicore performance when you need it while it will save battery while you are not using it.. All games and apps that I tested with this device ran great and there were no issues in terms of performance of the device. It did not heat while playing games for longer hours although you might find the phone a little slippery for a prolonged period of gaming.. Asus Primary advertised the Phone as ” Built for Photography ” making the camera a major highlight of the device. The Zenfone 3 ZE520KL is equipped with 16 MP Sony Exmor RS IMX298 sensor with 6 elements Largan Lens along with Sapphire glass cover. The Pixel size is at 1.12 um and the sensor size comes in at 1/2.8″.. The camera has a maximum aperture of f2.0 and comes with both OIS for Photos and ESI for Video. There is a laser auto focus along the side of the camera which a response time of 0.03 sec and has both Phase detection as well as Contrast Detection for autofocus. The Field of View of the Camera is at 77 degrees. We would be doing a separate in depth camera review of the phone so do check that out.. The overall camera performance will not only depend on its well-packed camera hardware but the Asus camera software that is used to capture those images. Images that came out of the camera are excellent most of the times but some times the camera prefers to shoot into a cooler tone. Although Asus do provide a full manual mode for the camera, we tried using it in Auto most of the times just to see how it performs.. One thing that really impressed me in the camera was the Autofocus speeds this phone is about to pull. The phone almost never lost focus of the subject and the time it takes to get them is excellent and a great job from Asus end. Low lights shots aren’t too bad with the Zenfone 3 camera.. Asus Zenfone 3 has one the best display I have used in any phones yet, specially outdoors. The phone comes with a 5.2 inch 1920 X 1080p screen which gives it a pixel density of around 424 ppi. The panel is extremely sharp and vivid. It is one of brightest displays you can find in any smartphone. The viewing angles and colours are excellent and I didn’t had any issues with the phones display what so ever.. Being a 5.2 inch device means that using the phone with one hand is pretty easy and comfortable.Its easier to slip into pockets and much more easier to hold and use.If you want a bigger size then you can go with the 5.5 inch variant of the device.. The Zenfone 3 come well equipped with the latest connectivity hardware inside the device. It has 4G LTE support with VoLTE, Wifi 802.11 ac(2.4 and 5GHz) MU-MIMO as well as Bluetooth 4.2 and GPS. It also has USB type C port and a headphone/mic in port on the top. The phone also has a hybrid sim slot and can support micro SD card up to 2 TB.. In terms of battery life the phone surprises a lot as I wasent expecting much from the built in 3000 mAh battery. The phone lasted a full day on my use of testing and casual gaming and 2 days while using the phone on regular basis. This is all done from Asus choice of going with the Snapdragon 625 processor which gives the phone a good overall battery life. If you still run out of juice you can easily charge the device as it support fast charging that can give you 2 hrs of talktime in just 5 min of charging.. The Zenfone 3 ZE520KL is one of the best phone we have seen from Asus in their Zenfone series so far. Its great that the company focused more toward design and making premium device and rather than focusing on just putting the latest and greatest processor inside the phones body. Although most people will still make their decision on what processor the phone has and how much it scores it the benchmark, we should sometime admire the beauty and design of the device and how premium it feels while using it. The Zenfone 3 is a excellent phone with a great battery life and a wonder full camera.. If you want a premium device under the 23000 price bracket you should definitely check this one out. It not only features the latest hardware but packs it in a well-crafted body that makes it a premium device that will stand out of the crowd..
