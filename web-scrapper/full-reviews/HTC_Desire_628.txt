All the features are excellent beside camera using flash light .It gives mirror Image like oil is placed on face .So it is not better camera phone.

So this is a budget oriented smartphone from HTC with many greater specs. This is none-other than the beautiful HTC Desire 628 4G LTE with unibody design language. Let’s go through the specs sheet quickly before jumping into the detailed HTC Desire 628 4G LTE Review. The HTC Desire 628 Review will surely cover all your queries about the phone.. The HTC desire 628 4g LTE sports 5” HD IPS display in unibody frame, the front and back has 5MP and 13MP lens respectively, while innards includes 3GB RAM, 32GB ROM, the multitasking is no more an issue with 1.3 GHz octa-core processor. Basically the Desire series is combination of entry level to upper mid-range smartphones, while the Desire 628 4G LTE sit in premium category due to 3GB RAM. The battery inside HTC Desire 628 is 2200 mAh and is fixed.. The actual price of HTC Desire 628 is PKR 23,999 Only.. The HTC Desire 628 is equipped with 5-inch HD IPS capacitive display having 720p resolution, the pixel density is 294 ppi. The HD IPS is a quite standard display for given prices range. It offers decent color saturation, while the display looks sharp and warm too. There is no as such viewing issue from different angles.. The light ambient sensor controls the brightness of screen. what I have personally noticed while testing the display of HTC Desire 628 is a kind of over saturation in color which lost the natural feels in colors.. The HTC Desire 628 is entirely made of polycarbonate plastic body which unibody structure, so that you would have no access to battery. The phone comes with contrast color combination, the edges and back cover has totally the contrast color that looks great. Though glossy finishing of color makes it bit slippery too.. The Desire 628 is 5 incher device that spreads on 146.9 x 70.9 x 8.1 mm with weight of just 142 grams, this makes it handier and compact smartphone and can be operated single handedly.. The front is completely covered with Glass though it isnot kind of Gorilla Glass. The top and bottom has two sound speakers and they are not boom sound speaker. The dual speakers at front disturbed the screen-to-body ratio which is just 66.2% that shows the body is bigger than the screen size.. On upper front is boomed with 5MP selfies shooter and couple of sensor that are bang on below the earpiece. The LED notification is great addition at front. The bottom has nothing except sound speaker.. Let’s talk about the HTC Desire 628 4G LTE four edges, starting from the top edge, it has just 3.5mm audio jack with boomsound feature. The power button and volume rocker are flanked from bumps on right edge and a bit lazy to be pressed quickly.. The 13MP lens with LED flash is on the back cover and placed on top left corner. In addition, the noise cancellation is also placed with back camera unit.. The HTC Desire 628 is giving 3GB RAM and 32GB ROM (internal storage) out of box and entirely out of the way. This is the point where HTC Desire 628 stands out giving 3GB of RAM and 32GB internal storage and with that micro-SD card support upto 256GB (Wow).. The HTC Desire 628 is using 13MP camera sensor and 5MP shooter on back and front respectively. The aperture configuration for back camera is f/2.2, quite standard for given price bracket. The camera picks colors in a good way, the pictures are sharp enough in a good light situation, however; in low light photography needs some improvement to handle noise in picture. HTC Desire 628 is quite responsive to autofocus the objects. The shallow depth in field is of average quality.. The camera application allows us to use camera with some professional touch, providing Pro Mode with range of setting including shutter speed, ISO, and Aperture.. HTC’s camera application is quite healthy while talking about the features and settings, having few shooting modes which include manual control with settings ISO, exposure, and white balance. You can also save your modified settings as a shooting mode for future use, which is a very pleasant touch.. The rear camera can make 1080p video so as front shooter. The front camera has 5MP lens, the camera is good enough and serviceable though, we can’t expect too much from the given price range.. The HTC desire 628 is 4G enabled smart phone. It has connectivity of LTE/3G in all bands. The speed limit over LTE network or 3G network is cat.4 150/50 Mbps. The smart phone is having some more connectivity such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and FM Radio. Wi-Fi has connectivity of 802.11 b/g/n whereas Bluetooth is available with version 4.1. The Desire 628 is packed with dual SIM accessibility furthermore dual stand by options is available which enables both SIM card to receive calls at the same time.. The HTC Desire 628 comes with a 2200 mAh non-removable battery which is better than the desire 626. As the device is carried with octa core processor so it will not make any issue in video section. HD resolutions with full brightness can drain the battery quickly as well as excessive use of mobile data can also decrease the battery power. There are couple of power saving modes that are available but still it’s difficult to get a full day of use from this smart phone.. Let’s look at software side of the device, the HTC desire 628 is featured with Android version 5.1 (Lollipop) with the HTC sense 7 UI on top. HTC has sense 7 UI which has better and clear focus on design and it keeps things smooth. The desire 628 is featured with Blinkfeed that has powerful multi-tasking menu and quick toggles. You can adjust everything according to your own liking.. Many bloatware applications are installed such as Digital Life, Wild Tangent Games, Keeper, Key VPN, Lookout, Uber, Yellow Pages, and a whole collection of redundant HTC apps are pre-installed, including three separate email clients.. Wild Tangent has several games in it for users to play and enjoy while Key VPN is security based application via which you can protect some features. Look out is totally your security based application which is used for high security purpose.. The HTC desire 628 is equipped with same processor used in QMobile Noir Z12 and Infinix Hot S. It has octa core Media tek MT6753 processor clocked at 1.3 GHZ moreover backed with 3GB of RAM.. If we look at this processing package, performance is on the satisfactory side. There were less delays and lags during games, animations and video. The device has worked efficiently in multi-tasking and games have smooth run time.. So finally we are able to make conclusion about HTC Desire 628, the phone has some attractive features like unibody structure, 3G RAM coupled with Octa-core chipset that surely speed up your work. The camera quality is average though not at top of list but still good for it category. The battery capacity remains an issue that needs some serious attention to be paid from HTC side.. If you want a fast and quick phone in range of 20K to 24K, keep HTC Desire 628 4G LTE in your wish list for high configuration. I would recommend the device for those who need more performance or for real gamers because it has great specs with 3GB and octa-core processor along with Mali-T720..

Review: HTC Desire 628 is a Feel Good Phone, But a Bit Overpriced. HTC Desire 628 works well in the budget, but fails to beat competition. Review: HTC Desire 628 is a Feel Good Phone, But a Bit Overpriced. Tech News 3 min read. HTC, the Taiwanese smartphone maker, is grappling with the rise of its Chinese counterparts, not just in India, but globally too. To stay relevant, the brand has launched a slew of new models across various price ranges. Targeting the mid-budget segment is the new HTC Desire 628 dual SIM. The phone is priced at Rs 13,990, but did it impress us? Read on.. Pros: Premium build Decent cameras 3 GB RAM Cons: Battery life Price. The first thing you notice is the compact form factor of the device, which has a 5-inch HD display on the front and a non-removable, glossy panel at the back. The phone is quite thin and light, but straight edges give it a very solid feel. An accented strip runs along the sides which gives the smartphone a dual-tone look.. HTC Desire 628 Dual SIM hasd a 5-inch display. Two speaker grilles on either side of the screen give it a very symmetric, aesthetic look, which come with HTC’s proprietary ‘BoomSound’ technology.. The HTC Desire 628 comes with ‘BoomSound’ Technology. The dual SIM 4G phone is snappy with a 3GB RAM and a 1.3 GHz MediaTek octa-core processor, and zipped through multiple tabs and apps I threw at it. It comes with 32GB on-board which can be expanded upto 2TB via microSD.. HTC Desire 628 comes with 1.3 GHz MediaTek octa-core processor.. Things are quite decent on the camera front, with the13-megapixel rear snapper producing sharp, quickly focused images. The 5-megapixel selfie camera has a Live Makeup feature which although clicks well-lit photos, gives a pastel appearance while hiding the blemishes. Both the cameras record 1080p videos.. Primary camera sample on HTC Desire 628 Dual SIM. The smartphone strives to pack a punch with its performance but falters on the juice to make it possible. HTC Desire 628 comes with a 2200mAh battery which may need a recharge after about 6-7 hours if you are an active user.. The phone has a 2200mAh battery. Also, for the price, one would expect more. For example, it comes with a 1280x720 screen, when competing models have established 1920x1080 Full HD resolution as a standard.. HTC Desire 628 has a 1280x720 screen.. The smartphone makes you feel good because it offers pretty much everything that an average smartphone user may need. But if you compare it to other phones in the same price-range, such as Xiaomi Redmi Note 3, Motorola G4, and even the latest LeEco Le 2, the HTC Desire 628 doesn’t stack up quite well. It would have been a perfect buy if it was priced a few thousands lower.. Go for this if you are an HTC fan looking for a desirable device that doesn’t pinch your pocket..

Please ask the question in above box. Yes, it supports, but not completely as it doesn't have a separate 4G LTE mode and because of which it will give you less speed as it has a 2G/3G/4G auto mode. So, it will definitely support your Jio SIM but you will not feel like using 4G.. Yes, but you can't ues it for calls only for internet.. Yes, but it does not support LTE.. Yeah , it support Jio 4G .. Voice over Long-Term Evolution (VoLTE) is a standard for high-speed wireless communication for mobile phones and data terminals. It is based on the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) network, with specific profiles for control and media planes of voice service on LTE defined by GSMA.. Voice over LTE (Long Term Evolution) is a standard for high-speed wireless communication for mobile phones and data terminals. In simple terms, it means, Voice calls are made through data Network.. Voice over Long-Term Evolution (Volte) is a standard for high-speed wireless communication for mobile phones and data terminals.. Without data connection, no calls can be done or received.. VoLTE is a feature of phone which allow you to call on 4G, but it can't support it.. Does it have fast charging option?. No, since the processor is a MediaTek chipset, it does not support fast charging. The only option for fast charging is to either use the supplied cable or to use 2.4 Amp USB cable from outside market.. no normal charging time 2.5 h.....it isn't support VoLTE. It does not have a built-in VoLTE. But if you are a Reliance Jio customer, then you can simply download Jio Voice app which will help you to make calls similar to VoLTE.. How is the battery of this mobile, is it good or not?. This phone comes with a 2,200 mAh battery and it is certainly not that reliable. I would recommend you to look for a phone with at least 3000mAh battery.. Very, very bad, within 3hrs the battery will drain. In a day, it needs to be charged 3 to 4 times if the internet is used.. It is good for normal calls, lasts up to 5 - 6 hrs a day.. User Reviews of HTC Desire 628. 2 Ratings 2 Reviews. 5 1. 4 0. 3 0. 2 0. 1 1. Rate & review this product and help other customers.

Make sure you go to the XDA kingroot page and Download the latest release. Don't use the version on Google Play because you may end up with kingoroot or kingroot pro which are not the real kingroot. Also make sure you have Allow unknown apps checked in security settings on your phone and USB debugging and switch off oem checked in developer options. I gained root that way a month or so ago but still haven't gotten to switch to a proper root with supersu or a custom recovery. I'm waiting for someone with more know how to get involved and get a way for that to happen but while Twrp and cwm don't support the Desire 628 it may be some time.

Run it and it will install SuperSu in the place of Kingroot and remove all the Kingroot files. You can also uninstall the Kingroot app once the SuperSUME app is done but it doesn't automatically remove the Kingroot files. I hope this helps you in replacing Kingroot with SuperSu. Flashing the latest SuperSU package through TWRP recovery works.. Make sure you go to the XDA kingroot page and Download the latest release. Don't use the version on Google Play because you may end up with kingoroot or kingroot pro which are not the real kingroot. Also make sure you have Allow unknown apps checked in security settings on your phone and USB debugging and switch off oem checked in developer options. I gained root that way a month or so ago but still haven't gotten to switch to a proper root with supersu or a custom recovery. I'm waiting for someone with more know how to get involved and get a way for that to happen but while Twrp and cwm don't support the Desire 628 it may be some time..
