First shown off at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the BlackBerry Priv — Priv standing for Privacy and Privilege — is a new BlackBerry device from the manufacturer of the same name, featuring a slide-out portrait keyboard and running Google's Android OS (in this case 5.1.1 Lollipop) — the first device from BlackBerry to do so.. The BlackBerry Priv has all of the leading specs for a high-end Android phone in 2015 — a Snapdragon 808 processor, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, a 5.4-inch curved 2560x1440 touchscreen and a slider-style keyboard along with an 18MP camera on the back.

CNET también está disponible en español.. Slick Android slider with niche appeal. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The BlackBerry Priv delivers strong performance in a sleek, solid package. The subtle tweaks to Android are useful, and the compact keyboard packs in useful functionality. It's also fun to slide open, over and over again.. The Bad The keyboard is a bit narrow for large hands, and the device feels top heavy when fully extended. This security-focused phone is missing a few modern protection options, like a fingerprint reader or iris scanner.. The Bottom Line Android and an awesome keyboard make the Priv the best BlackBerry in years, but if you're not a keyboard lover and aren't much of a security seeker, you'll find phones that are cheaper, or offer better features than the Priv.. 5.4-inch AMOLED display, 2,560x1,440 pixel resolution. 5.7 (7.2 when open) by 3.04 by 0.37 inches (147/184 when open by 77.2 by 9.4 mm). Gesture controls BlackBerry's DTEK security software. Once the darling of the smartphone world, these days the company has been long displaced by upstarts like Apple and Google. The new BlackBerry Priv won't change that, but it's aimed at bringing the BlackBerry brand back into the limelight. And for BlackBerry apostates and the physical keyboard-curious, it'll have to. Dalliances with the Amazon app store's subset of the Android ecosystem failed to light a fire for BlackBerry, so there's a chance this might be the last gasp for the storied smartphone manufacturer.. Take a closer look at the BlackBerry Priv (pictures). Short for "privacy" and" privilege" (as in, privacy is your privilege), the Priv ditches BlackBerry 10 OS to run Android Lollipop, but still promises to deliver the secure experience you'd expect from the BlackBerry pedigree. Remember BlackBerry 10 OS? Most developers don't.. Inside BlackBerry's last-ditch plan to win you back with Android. ZDNet: BlackBerry Priv has a big flaw: It's a privacy flop. ZDNet: BlackBerry Priv review: A passable Android phone, poor on privacy. ZDNet: BlackBerry promises monthly Android patches; can override carriers for critical hotfixes. BlackBerry's insistence on sticking to its vision of a secure, productivity-and-enterprise focused OS proved near fatal, as the mobile hegemony it once enjoyed was gobbled up by Android and iOS, buoyed by consumers hungry for apps. The company has seen its market reach dwindle. It sold just 800,000 smartphones last quarter, less than half as many as it sold a year ago. , and the move to Android could do just that.. The BlackBerry Priv is an attractive device, thicker than the competition on Android, but sporting a backlit QWERTY keyboard that slides out from behind the 5.4-inch quad HD display. If you're a lapsed BlackBerry acolyte, come for the uncompromising physical keyboard and security pedigree, but stay for the access to the full Android app store.. The BlackBerry Priv is available unlocked for $699, directly from BlackBerry's website. AT&T will be the first carrier to launch with the Priv, and if you opt for a two-year contract, it'll be available for $250. Verizon has confirmed that the BlackBerry Priv is "coming soon ," though there's no word on a release date. Carphone Warehouse in the UK has the phone unlocked for £560. If you're in Canada, you can get the phone for $400 on a two-year contract or $800 unlocked at Bell, Telus, Rogers, SaskTel, Eastlink and Wind Mobile.. The BlackBerry Priv runs Android Lollipop 5.1.1.. The BlackBerry Priv's best feature is probably that authoritative slap when you slide the phone open or closed.. OK, that's a bit of an exaggeration.. Some would say it's the 5.4-inch screen. Coated in Corning Gorilla Glass 4, it has a relatively high pixel density paired with a 1440p resolution, leaving text sharp and crisp and images looking attractive. Others might call out the signature professional BlackBerry styling. Whenever I handle a BlackBerry phone I get the distinct impression that stuff is about to get done.. Most would make an obvious nod to the keyboard itself. It's vintage BlackBerry style, backlit with a layout identical to the BlackBerry Classic. This keyboard feels a bit narrower than BlackBerry's previous efforts. Because it's a slider, the keys can't roam right up to the edge of the frame. I have fairly large hands, which means my thumbs can get a little tangled once I get up to speed while I'm typing.. I imagine spending a lot of time with the Priv's keyboard will make typing faster, and it only took a few hours before I was touch-typing with minimal effort. But I can also touch-type fairly capably on my Motorola Nexus 6 , and I find I'm actually faster there (and on the Priv's touchscreen) than I am with the keyboard (with generous assistance from autocorrect, of course). Beyond the occasional review, my day-to-day phone experience revolves around touchscreens. I suspect it's the same for most of us.. The keyboard might be a bit cramped for large hands.. Don't get me wrong, the keyboard's great. And the Priv's capacitive keys know the same awesome tricks I saw on the BlackBerry Passport , albeit in a package that's much easier to hold. Double tap lightly on the keyboard and it'll serve as a trackpad, so you can quickly move a cursor around a document or message you're editing. And if you see autocorrect suggestions on your display, just swipe up underneath the suggestion on the keyboard, and the word will be inserted. Reaching up and touching the screen isn't so arduous, but it'd be nice not to break up the flow.. It's still mostly about that solid clap on the slider, for me. The Priv's top half slides along aircraft-grade aluminium and it feels springy and responsive, but rigid enough that you won't find yourself doing it accidentally. While the phone gets a bit tall when it's fully extended, you'll only pop it out when you're typing. My hands naturally propped the phone up at a comfortable angle while my thumbs were on the keys. That said, my small-handed colleagues gave the phone a spin and found it feels a bit top-heavy, when it's open. I never worried about dropping it, but your mileage may vary.. The Priv also has a curved display. The phone's sliding mechanism means the screen doesn't wrap around quite as completely as. Samsung's Galaxy S6 Edge+ , and it isn't as useful. Samsung's curved displays let you store app shortcuts, or serve up notifications, or keep tabs on missed calls. The Priv's curved sides host a fairly mundane productivity app (more on that in a bit), and a neat little battery status indicator when you're charging.. The phone offers NFC connectivity file sharing or shopping with. Android Pay , and there's a single microUSB 2.0 connector at the bottom that's SlimPort enabled -- with the right adapters, you can get HDMI, DVI and DisplayPort connectivity, as well as pipe out 4K video at 30 frames per second.. Android, with that BlackBerry security pedigree.. BlackBerry's in-house operating system couldn't woo developers away from iOS and Android, and with the Priv, the company is officially adopting the "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em" approach. It runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, and will eventually make the move to Android 6.0 Marshmallow .. Before you shed tears for the end of an era, take note that an Android-powered BlackBerry means access to the Google Play Store, and all of the apps therein. A lack of apps has been BlackBerry's Achilles heel for years, so this is already a great step.. But tales persist of Android malware and data leeched off of phones and over to unscrupulous foes, and BlackBerry is well aware of Android's less than savory security reputation. The company has pledged to keep the Priv secure, and will encrypt the files and sensitive information on the Priv -- anything that's encrypted never leaves your device.. BlackBerry has also committed to rolling out monthly security updates as Google discovers and addresses vulnerabilities. In cases where a vulnerability can't wait for a monthly update, BlackBerry will also be able to roll out hotfixes directly to the Priv -- the company has pledged to work with carriers on delivering updates, but also has the ability to circumvent them, and directly patch the Priv if necessary. On the enterprise level, you can turn to BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) to manage software and security deployments.. BlackBerry has also added a few light touches to the Android operating system. While I generally prefer the stock Android experience, I like the extras added here.. Turn on pop up widgets, and an ellipsis will show up under the icons of any apps with widgets. Swipe up on the icon, and the widget will show up in a temporary overlay on your screen. It'll behave like a normal widget, and then disappear when you're done with it. You're still free to use normal widgets, of course. But I find that apps like Google Keep are handy to have around, but don't necessarily need to take over an entire homescreen. This feature is a neat compromise.. The curved screen doesn't get much use.. Plug the phone in and you'll see a little line darting along the border of the screen. It's the Battery Edge, and it'll glow red, yellow, or green, depending on the Priv's power level. You'll also see a little percentage readout, as well as an estimate of the remaining charging time, so you can keep tabs on your phone while it's charging. It runs along the curve, which keeps it out of the way, so you can use your phone while it's plugged in without obscuring the screen. I'm a bit embarrassed about how much I like this, but it's an inconsequential extra that makes the screen's sometimes superfluous curves a bit more useful.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

The BlackBerry Priv is the mullet of the smartphone world. It's still business in the front, but now there's a party in the back too. It will divide opinion, but this is the best BlackBerry in years.. Update: BlackBerry has now released its Android 6 Marshmallow update for the Priv and it comes with a selection of new BB specific features as well as the tweaks Google provides. You can download the update right now.. Well this is a turn-up for the books. After almost four years of banging the BlackBerry 10 drum it seems the Canadian firm has finally admitted defeat, launching its first Android smartphone in the BlackBerry Priv.. It's not entirely a surprise – the Priv was rumored for months under the codename Venice, and a move to the Android platform makes sense.. BlackBerry 10 suffered from a severe lack of top-flight applications, and an interface which wasn't quite as intuitive for the general public as the now familiar Android and iOS.. That's all been addressed, with the BlackBerry Priv sporting Google's stock Android platform, and with it access to the app-packed Play Store. In fact, it recently received an update to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, which brought with it a number of further tweaks and improvements.. Coupled with a tasty sounding display, some handy BB apps and BlackBerry's legendary keyboard the Priv is finally helping the Canadian firm to make some positive strides in the market. But is it all a little too late again from the firm that was left behind by the original smartphone revolution?. BlackBerry is evidently convinced that it's done a good thing with its decision to switch to a new OS, as it's planning three more Android-powered handsets for 2016.. The BlackBerry Priv's 5.4-inch QHD display, Snapdragon 808 processor, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage and 18MP rear camera means it stands up against the flagship competition of 2015 – the problem is, it arrived around six months later, and 2016 has seen a new batch of pumped-up competitors like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and the HTC 10 .. One thing the Priv has on its side compared to those newer models is price. If you shop around, you can pick one up SIM-free for around £450 in the UK (roughly AU$779), or for around $400 in the US. It's the same benefit/curse of every Android flagship more than three months old, but it's still a bonus.. Of course there's another related problem here, in that the Priv's contemporaries have also dropped in price since launch - in many cases by a good deal more.. You can pick up a brand new Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge , HTC One M9 , LG G4 , Nexus 6P or Sony Xperia Z3+ for less than the Priv – and these remain some of the best phones in the world , irrespective of the fact that most have since been superseded.. The BlackBerry Priv has its work cut out then, if it's going to convince people to part with more cash and shun the established names in the Android market.. The 'Priv' name stands for Privacy, but on the box it also says Privilege, so things are a little confusing from the outset. But it's not all bad news, as BlackBerry has managed to make a surprisingly good handset.. The BlackBerry Priv is a smartphone I've been genuinely excited to see, as it brings something different to the Android market, and I was pretty content when I got it in my hands.. It's been years since I had a slider phone – I loved my Nokia N95 – and the satisfying sound and action as you pop open and close the BlackBerry Priv will no doubt transport you back to the early noughties, when slider phones were big business.. There's a slight metal ridge towards the bottom of the Priv, between the screen glass and front-facing speaker, enabling you to get your thumb under and push the handset up to reveal the keyboard.. Push the screen two-thirds of the way up the keyboard and the Priv will complete the sliding pop action for you. I found myself idly playing with the slider throughout the day – there's something comforting about flicking the Priv open and closed.. Satisfying slide action aside, the BlackBerry Priv isn't exactly small, and nor is it lightweight. At 147 x 77.2 x 9.4mm the Priv is sizeable in the hand, although not completely dominating.. I was able to hold it one-handed and perform basic tasks, but for intensive periods of writing you'll want to hold on with both mitts, especially when you consider that the Priv tips the scales at 192g. Just to place that in context, the Nexus 6 , which many have derided for its excessive bulk, weighs 'just' 184g.. Flip the phone's display up to reveal the keyboard and the height extends to 184mm, which feels very top-heavy when you're tapping away on the keys – but more on that in the next section.. BlackBerry has followed in Samsung's footsteps when it comes to the screen, as the Priv sports dual-curved sides just like the Galaxy S7 Edge and Galaxy S6 Edge before it. The edges aren't quite as pronounced as Samsung's implementation, but it still generates an eye-catching effect which draws the eye in.. The glass front surrounded by a metal rim, which is raised at the top and bottom to protect the screen when it's face-down, makes the Priv appear suitably premium. Pick it up, though, and the illusion is somewhat shattered.. BlackBerry has clad the back and sides of the Priv in what it calls a tensile weave, which basically means it's not metal or glass, but what feels like rubbery plastic.. It's the same finish as found on the Q10 and Z30 , and while it does have a nicer finish than the plastic Samsung used to insist on splashing on its flagships it's certainly no match for the elegance of the iPhone 6S , One M9 or Galaxy S6 .. The plus side here is that the material is extremely grippy, and the rounded edges of the BlackBerry Priv means it can be held securely in hand.. I found the plastic covering to be a little creaky in places too, and applying just a small amount of pressure on the side below the power/lock key generated a squeaking noise from my launch handset. The second handset we got in for testing further down the line doesn't have this issue, however, so it may just have been a one-off or an issue with the initial batch.. The rear of the Priv is dominated by a sizeable, protruding Schneider Kreuznach camera sensor, with a dual-LED flash to its side. These, plus the iconic BlackBerry logo, are the only features on the flat rear of the handset.. On top you'll find trays for the nanoSIM and microSD card, while on the base a centralized microUSB port resides next to a headphone jack.. All in all, the BlackBerry Priv is a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to design. I love the slider action and the dual-curved display, but it's let down by a weighty construction and creaky plastic..

Wi-Fi : 802.11 a / b / g / n 2.4/5 GHz. The BlackBerry Priv is a slider smartphone developed by BlackBerry Limited. Following a series of leaks, it was officially announced by BlackBerry CEO John Chen on September 25, 2015, with pre-orders opening on October 23, 2015, for a release on November 6, 2015. The Priv is the first BlackBerry -branded smartphone that does not run the company's proprietary BlackBerry OS or BlackBerry 10 (BB10) platforms. It instead uses Android , customized with features inspired by those on BlackBerry phones, and security enhancements. With its use of Android—one of two smartphone platforms that significantly impacted BlackBerry's early dominance in the smartphone industry—the company sought to leverage access to the larger ecosystem of software available through the Google Play Store (as opposed to BlackBerry 10 devices, which were limited to native BB10 apps from BlackBerry World and Android apps from the third-party Amazon Appstore running in a compatibility subsystem), in combination with a slide-out physical keyboard and privacy-focused features. The BlackBerry Priv received mixed reviews. Critics praised the Priv's user experience for incorporating BlackBerry's traditional, productivity-oriented features on top of the standard Android experience, including a notifications feed and custom e-mail client. Some critics felt that the device's physical keyboard did not perform as well as those on previous BlackBerry devices, and that the Priv's performance was not up to par with other devices using the same system-on-chip. The Priv was also criticized for being more expensive than similarly-equipped devices in its class. While BlackBerry was dominant in the early smartphone market, partially due to a large market share within the enterprise and governmental markets, the company had struggled in recent years due to the dominance of Apple Inc. and its iPhone line, and Android devices—primarily by Samsung Electronics. [6] By June 2015, the company's market share in the U.S. consumer market had fallen to 1.2%. [7] Facing a struggling ecosystem for native, third-party software on BlackBerry 10 , BlackBerry added a compatibility layer for Android software to the OS, and allowed developers to repackage their Android apps for distribution on BlackBerry World. Later versions added the ability for users to manually install Android app packages. Beginning with the BlackBerry Passport , Amazon Appstore was bundled with BlackBerry 10 to provide an additional source of third-party Android software. [8] [9] [10] BlackBerry CEO John S. Chen hoped that Amazon's own smartphone, the Fire Phone , would bolster the adoption of the Amazon store and attract more major developers to it, and in turn, BlackBerry's ecosystem. However, the Fire Phone was a commercial failure, which led to BlackBerry's decision to develop an Android phone of its own. In early 2014, BlackBerry's device head Ron Louks proposed that the company construct an Android device. Company officials, including Chen, showed concerns over the project, as they believed the platform was not secure enough. However, Louks gained support for the project after outlining plans for hardware-based security. [11] At Mobile World Congress 2015, BlackBerry's device head Ron Louks briefly presented a non-functioning prototype of a new, BlackBerry 10 phone that featured a sliding keyboard and a screen curved across both sides, similar to the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge that was unveiled during the same convention. [11] [12] [13] In July 2015, new images of the curved device leaked under the codename "Venice"; unlike the version presented at MWC, it was now shown to be running Android 5.0 "Lollipop" rather than BlackBerry 10. [14] Information about the device's software leaked in August 2015, showing a "stock" Android experience augmented with ports of features and apps from BB10, such as BlackBerry Hub. In response to the leaks, Chen officially confirmed during a September 2015 earnings call that BlackBerry would release a high-end Android-based device, now known as the Priv (standing for both "privilege" and "privacy"), in late 2015. [16] Chen felt that the decision to produce an Android phone was to help BlackBerry's device business sustain itself, saying that "we have some really committed diehards. I respect that there's a lot of heritage here, a lot of pride. If the math doesn't add up, the math doesn't add up. We could keep the pride and die hungry or we can eat well and not so proud, maybe. So I chose to eat well. It’s good for the company to continue to have a shot at building handsets." [2] He also argued that the decision was meant to "[take] advantage of what the industry can offer", whilst continuing to leverage BlackBerry's "core strength". BlackBerry promoted certain security enhancements made to the build of Android bundled with the Priv, which include utilizing features of its SoC to embed unchangeable cryptographic keys in the device hardware which are used to validate critical boot components, thus establishing a "root of trust" designed to foil attempts to tamper with the OS. [18] [19] Additionally, kernel security enhancements are mentioned. (Provided by grsecurity ) [20] BlackBerry also promoted that storage encryption would be enabled by default on the Priv, as well as a general company commitment to timely patch releases for known Android security vulnerabilities, subject to carrier approval. The company stated that BlackBerry 10 devices would continue to co-exist alongside Android-based devices; BlackBerry COO Marty Beard explained that BlackBerry 10 is able to meet "very high-end security needs" that cannot currently be met by Android, while Chen reported that the platform has seen adoption in enterprise and governmental markets. Chen stated that he would consider dropping BlackBerry 10 if his company were able to port all of its security features to Android. [17] [23] However, BlackBerry has not released any new BlackBerry 10-powered devices since, and discontinued its BlackBerry Classic in July 2016. mm), 1440p AMOLED display, which is slightly curved around the horizontal sides of the device. The rear of the device is coated in a "glass weave" material. [3] The screen can be slid up to reveal a hardware keyboard; similarly to the BlackBerry Passport , the keyboard is touch-sensitive and can register sliding gestures across its keys for scrolling, text selection, and autocomplete suggestions. [26] The device's bezel also features dedicated camera and Convenience buttons. The Priv utilizes a hexa-core Snapdragon 808 system-on-chip with 3. GB of RAM, consisting of four low-power Cortex-A53 cores and two Cortex-A57 cores, and includes a non-removable 3420. mAh battery which BlackBerry claims can last for 22-and-a-half hours of "mixed use". [3] The Priv includes 32. GB of internal storage, with the option to expand the amount of available storage using a microSD card up to 2. The device features an 18-megapixel rear-facing camera with phase detection autofocus and optical image stabilization , and a 2-megapixel front camera. The Priv shipped with Android 5.1.1 "Lollipop" a month after Android Marshmallow was launched, using a "stock" user experience customized with additional features and BlackBerry-developed apps. BlackBerry Hub (which originates from BlackBerry 10) [15] aggregates notifications and content from multiple sources and allows for granular management of messages and "snoozing" based off time, location or network availability. Hub can also be accessed alongside BlackBerry Search and Google Search options when swiping from the bottom of the screen. [26] The "Productivity Edge" feature allows a tab to be shown on either the left or right curve of the display, which can be dragged out to display an agenda screen. A progress bar can also be displayed on an edge when the device is charging. [28] An application's home screen widget can be made available from its respective shortcut icon by swiping, which displays the widget as a pop-up window. [29] The DTEK app allows users to view an overview of the security and privacy status of the device based on best practices, and provide notifications when apps attempt to access sensitive information or permissions. [3] The Priv also integrates with the pre-existing Android for Work suite, which allows personal and work-oriented data on a device to be segregated (similarly to the BlackBerry Balance features on BB10). In late-April 2016, BlackBerry began to release an upgrade to Android 6.0 "Marshmallow" ; [33] along with features added to the core Android platform (which includes a new permissions system, and systems to reduce background activity when the device is not being physically handled to conserve battery power), [34] it adds S/MIME , Slack , Skype , and Pinterest support to BlackBerry Hub, slide input on the physical keyboard, faster autofocus, and 24. On September 11, 2017, Alex Thurber, the General Manager of Blackberry Mobility Solutions; told Android Authority, the Priv wouldn’t be receiving the Android Nougat update. The Verge felt that the Priv's design was "quite good", noting that the thinness of the device's two halves averted it from feeling "top-heavy" when its keyboard was in use. [3] The Wall Street Journal described the frame and curved screen as being "a pleasure to hold and look at." [4] Ars Technica was critical of the device's overall build quality, with its back cover described as feeling "spongy" its sliding mechanism described as being "scratchy" and "friction-filled", while its curved screen was considered a "rather useless gimmick" that was inappropriate for the device's target market. [5] Ars Technica also panned the hardware mute button for being "counterintuitive", as it does not mute the device unless it is already playing audio, otherwise triggering the system volume controls. [5] The hardware keyboard received mixed reviews. The Wall Street Journal described the keyboard as being the "smartphone equivalent of a Colonial butter churn ", noting that, although it was faster to type on in comparison to virtual keyboards, the BlackBerry Classic had a larger and wider keyboard. [4] Ars Technica felt it was "unpleasant" to use due to its size, flat keys and how it interacts with the OS. [5] PC Magazine described its display as being "beautiful", [37] while Ars Technica felt that it had a "grainy" color reproduction. In regards to performance, PC Magazine described the Priv as having "[benchmarked] like [an LG G4 ] that's been throttled down after some gaming", noting that its AnTuTu scores were lower than those of the Nexus 6P and Samsung Galaxy S6. It also noted that while it wasn't "technically" unresponsive, "there are some complex animations and missed touch or typing inputs that might make you feel like it is". [37] The Wall Street Journal felt that the Priv felt "inexcusably slow" at times, reporting instances of slow or unresponsive apps. [4] The battery life was praised, with The Wall Street Journal remarking that it "outran" the Nexus 5X , 6P and iPhone 6S , [4] while PC Magazine credited its aggressive suppression of background activity as improving its standby battery life, stating that it survived a weekend of use with 25% capacity still remaining. [37] In contrast, The Verge and Ars Technica claimed they were unable to reach the device's advertised battery life. [3] PC Magazine praised the Priv's call quality, noting that it had a clear microphone and "delivers very loud maximum speakerphone and earpiece volume with zero distortion or wobble." [37] The Priv's rear-facing camera was criticized for having autofocus issues and for producing washed-out images with poor contrast and low-light performance. Ars Technica approved of the phone's software for staying close to Android's default user experience while providing optional enhancements, but noted that it did not ship with the latest version of Android. BlackBerry Hub was also praised by The Verge allowing users to "filter all of [their notifications] in a million different ways to get super productive views of what you need to get done really quickly", but criticized for not supporting all services and for not allowing users to archive messages from Gmail within the interface. PC Magazine noted that some of the features BlackBerry added to Android could be accomplished with widgets on other devices. [37] The Wall Street Journal felt that most of the enhancements to the OS were useful and the email interface was "[trumping] all others when it comes to formatting options", although it was slower than the Gmail app. The focus on user privacy was described as "not running very deep"; although the DTEK app and its privacy suggestions were well received, it was noted that most of the improvements to privacy and security were not exclusive to the Priv and that the hardened kernel, while making the phone more secure in theory, had not been externally audited. [4] PC Magazine similarly questioned the security features, noting that Android "Marshmallow" allows app permissions to be revoked individually (a function not implemented by DTEK) and supports device encryption, and that using Google services requires users to agree to data collection by the company to begin with. The Priv was also criticized for its high price in comparison to other recent "flagship" phones with better specifications. [3] [4] [5] In conclusion, while commending BlackBerry for being in "way better shape with the Priv than it was with any of its BB10 devices", the Priv was ultimately described by Ars Technica as being "passable" and recommended the Nexus 6P as a cheaper alternative. [5] The Wall Street Journal felt that the Priv was "a really good phone for people who want a [hardware] keyboard and a more secure Android experience", but that it "isn't going to put BlackBerry back on top again". [4] The Verge felt that the Priv was a "remarkable" debut for Android on BlackBerry hardware, albeit marred by its performance issues. BlackBerry did not provide specific sales numbers for the Priv, only stating in April 2016 that it had sold a total of 650,000 devices during the fiscal quarter ending February 29, 2016, and that these numbers were down from its original projection of 800,000. An unnamed AT&T executive stated to CNET that a large number of customers were returning the device, and that the company believed BlackBerry had priced the Priv too high. ^ "Priv, The Android Phone With A Physical Keyboard, Goes Up For Pre-Order".

Press enter or click on the search icon. Android operating system with BlackBerry services. BlackBerry Priv – Design & Keyboard. At MWC , Blackberry will officially unveil the new Mercury. A keyboard toting Android phone that harks back to the brand’s glory days. Will it be a success? Blackberry fans will certainly hope so.. The BlackBerry Priv is a Hail Mary pass by the former tech powerhouse, hoping to revive its fortunes by adopting the Android operating system, resurrecting the slidable physical keyboard, and pushing a wealth of BlackBerry security and productivity services.. It follows the release of several BlackBerry OS 10 smartphones that were great for enterprise, but not so hot for Joe Bloggs, like the squarely business-minded Passport .. This complete rethink of strategy not only makes the Priv the best BlackBerry smartphone in over half a decade, but also one of 2015’s most interesting Android handsets. Related: 13 best smartphones in 2015. BlackBerry’s never shied away from experimenting with its designs. It’s done everything from pure touchscreen devices like the Z10 , to old-school keyboard phones like the Classic, to outright bizarre handsets like the Passport .. As a result it’s no surprise the Priv’s design is a little different to most handsets, chiefly because it’s a slider phone, with a physical keyboard hidden beneath its main display that can be accessed by sliding the screen up. They were all the rage before Apple’s first iPhone hit the scene in 2007, remember?. The keyboard seen on the Priv isn’t a traditional BlackBerry QWERTY keyboard. It’s an updated version of the capacitive keyboard that debuted on the Passport, which means you can, in theory, use it as a touchpad as well.. The keyboard will be a boon for older buyers and BlackBerry fans, and does undeniably make it easier to edit spreadsheets and text documents. However, to people who’ve grown up on purely touchscreens and those unconcerned with using their phone for work, the addition will feel a little bizarre or unnecessary. This is largely because the Priv’s keyboard is a little too small for my liking.. It’s keys are reactive and well built, but they’re a too close together. Unless you have outright dainty hands you’ll regularly find yourself mashing the wrong key. Within days I found myself using the on screen keyboard by default out of sheer frustration.. This is a little sad as the trackpad functionality works very well, and makes it easy to move the onscreen cursor to the exact point of text you want to edit or highlight without having to awkwardly prod the Priv’s screen.. I’d forgive all of this were it not for the extra weight and thickness the keyboard adds to the Priv. When I picked up the Priv from BlackBerry, a spokesperson on hand made a big song and dance about how competing smartphone companies’ designs are too focused on “making things thin” and that in reality for most consumers “bigger is better”..

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. After a few seconds suppressing an immature giggle, I realised he wasn’t joking. There’s no getting around the fact that the Priv is giant. Measuring in at 9.4mm thick and weighing 192g, this phone will feel giant unless you’re used to phablets like the Galaxy S6 Edge Plus or iPhone 6S Plus .. Despite its hefty weight, I did find plenty to like about the Priv’s design. With the keyboard hidden the Priv feels a little like a BlackBerry-Samsung hybrid.. The Samsung design comparison begins the moment you see the Priv’s screen, which wraps around the first couple of millimeters of the phone’s long sides – like smaller versions of Samsung’s custom “Edge” displays.. However, flip it over and the design becomes pure BlackBerry. The phone has a “woven” carbon fibre back emblazoned with BlackBerry’s logo.. The combination may sound odd, but I found it gives the Priv a unique and luxurious feel. The carbon fibre’s lightly textured finish proved noticeably more scratch and dirt resistant than competing glass-backed handsets like the Galaxy S6 or Xperia Z5, and also made it easy for me to get a solid grip on the Priv, despite its chunky dimensions.. When I did lose my grip and accidentally dropped the Priv onto a carpeted floor, the handset survived chip and scratch free. The sliding keyboard hinge also feels solid and is smooth to use.. However, the back has a lot of flex and noticeably bends when met with even moderate force. This left me concerned about its ability to survive more serious drops or bumps with hard surfaces.. I was pleased to see BlackBerry’s loaded the Priv with a microSD card slot, meaning those that wish to can upgrade the phone’s built-in 32GB of storage. The only potential shortcomings with the Priv’s design are its lack of a fingerprint scanner or USB Type-C port.. USB Type-C is rapidly becoming the new standard in mobile and tablet designs. It promises to offer significantly faster charging and data transfer speeds than the older Micro USB standard.. Fingerprint scanners are en vogue in smartphones at the moment, designed to make it easier for users to secure their handsets. They’ve appeared on numerous other top-end Android smartphones, such as the Galaxy S6 , Xperia Z5 , OnePlus 2 , Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P .. Given how useful I’ve found the scanners on those phones, I’m a little perplexed as to why security-minded BlackBerry hasn’t cooked one into the Priv.. The lack of a fingerprint scanner is partially made up for via the addition of a picture password option. The picture password options make it so you have to drag a chosen number on a randomised grid displayed over a picture to a preset point. The grid changes each time you try to unlock the phone, so people can’t guess it by looking at smudge patterns on the glass.. Thankfully, the Priv doesn’t come with a square screen, as the Passport did. BlackBerry has instead loaded it with a rectangular 5.4-inch, 2560 x 1440 WQH curved screen.. People may accuse BlackBerry of ripping off Samsung on the curved part, but for the majority of the time the curves are little more than a clever aesthetic element, and the main display’s performance is great.. Featuring a 540ppi density, the screen is as sharp as most competing top-end Android handsets, such as the LG G4 and Samsung Galaxy S6. The high resolution means images and text are constantly sharp and you’ll never once struggle to read web pages, documents or ebooks on the phone.. Thanks to the use of AMOLED screen technology, increasingly being used by numerous Android phone makers, the Priv also has vibrant colours and deep blacks.. Related: 10 Best Android Phones in 2015 It creates colours by electrically charging each individual pixel when generating colours, letting them create deeper, richer blacks simply by turning off the relevant pixels. The deeper blacks in theory help colours to pop out more.. The tech works a treat on the Priv. Blacks are uniformly deep and don’t have the grey tinge seen on competing IPS displays, like the iPhone 6S’s. Colours also look wonderfully rich without being overcooked.. Brightness levels don’t match some handsets, like the Samsung Galaxy S6 or Moto X Style , but are still more than good enough for everyday use – though like 99% of the phones I review, the screen does become difficult to read when hit with direct sunlight.. The only downside to the display is that whites aren’t quite as clean as I’d like. Comparing the Priv to the Nexus 5X , whites have a slightly greyish tone, though they’re far from the worst I’ve seen.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

Trending iPhone X Nintendo Switch OnePlus 5T Tesla Model 3 Xbox One X. BlackBerry Priv REVIEW – I’m in love with a BlackBerry again. by Todd Haselton | November 17, 2015. I was in the audience when BlackBerry announced the BlackBerry Z10. The CEO at the time, Thorsten Heins, proclaimed “BlackBerry is back!” Of course, that was just the start of BlackBerry 10, which didn’t do much to change the company’s fortunes in the face of competition from iOS and Android. BlackBerry wasn’t “back” and while it’s still sticking with that operating system, it’s also finally and rightly, trying something new.. That’s where the Priv comes in. It’s the company’s first foray into a smartphone that runs a full version of Android. But it doesn’t compromise on what some of us still love about BlackBerry – the hardware keyboard, the dedication to security, and top-notch hardware design.. Jon Rettinger and I have been testing two BlackBerry Priv units, both on AT&T, for the past couple of weeks. One is a review unit and the second I bought on my personal AT&T account. Yes, like others out there, I’ve been antsy for a BlackBerry that runs Android.. We’re not here to report back on whether or not this device will “save the company “ as so many people have asked, but rather to report back on how well the phone executes on BlackBerry’s attempt to build a good Android phone.. There are aspects of the hardware that I love and some that I don’t. The large Quad HD display is pretty good. The viewing angles are solid, and the curved edges create an almost bezel-less look. It doesn’t get as bright as competing devices, which bothered me but not Jon, but is otherwise crisp and colorful.. There’s a large speaker along the bottom of the phone that gets pretty loud, though not as loud as one might think given the size of it. I do like that it’s forward-facing, though, which was great for gaming, watching movies or taking a speakerphone phone call on my desk.. The button placement is a bit awkward, I don’t like how the power button is on one side far away from the volume keys, and that there’s an additional key between the volume buttons. That’s supposed to be for toggling the silent mode on and off, but it pulls up a menu that requires you to do it. I wish it just turned the option on and off.. I love the soft touch back. BlackBerry described it as a glass weave. It feels grippy enough that you don’t feel like you’re going to drop it, but not overly gummy like it has residue on it. It’s nice and soft and, even after more than a week in my pocket, still looks brand new without any scratches.. The keyboard is great, and I got used to typing on it for almost every task from emails to participating in GroupMe and Slack texts. I wish there was a way to squeeze in a dedicated number row, but BlackBerry has those doubled up on some keys, or available through software keyboards that can be accessed by swiping up on the hardware keyboard. There’s a good amount of travel for each key, and while typing felt cramped at first, I was flying away after a couple of days.. The sliding mechanism feels solid and I suspect it will easily hold up for use. BlackBerry said it specifically tested this so that users don’t have to worry about deterioration over time. I did notice, however, that the phone creaks a bit when the keyboard is stowed away. I suspect this is because of the extra parts needed for this all to work, and it doesn’t feel cheap, it just gives a bit when you press on the back or front of the device, as if something is wobbling.. You’ll find a USB port on the bottom of the phone, next to a 3.5mm headphone jack, and an 18-megapixel Schneider-Kreusnach camera on the back with dual-LED flash. The top of the phone is home to a nanoSIM tray and a microSD card slot. The latter is a must-have for me, so I’m glad it’s an option.. Finally, the BlackBerry Priv also supports wireless charging in the U.S. if you buy it from ShopBlackBerry or AT&T. It’s slow to charge this way, and the charging seems to be somewhere near the butt of the phone, so it doesn’t sit well on my charging pads. But Qi is there if you want to use it. I wasn’t able to test PMA support.. In general, I think the BlackBerry Priv looks and operates like an expensive, first-class smartphone. It’ll be right at home in suit pockets, but still offers a unique and playful curved design.. The BlackBerry Priv runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. Don’t expect to jump to Marshmallow anytime soon – the company says it’s working on it, but you likely won’t get the update until 2016. That’s OK by us, because BlackBerry keeps the experience pretty close to stock.. There are some neat BlackBerry features laid on top of Lollipop, though it doesn’t feel as wallpapered as something like TouchWiz does. You can hold the circle menu button – the home button – to bring up Google Now, Blackberry Device Search application or BlackBerry Hub. The first two are self-explanatory, and the third will be familiar to BlackBerry 10 users.. BlackBerry Hub provides an all-encompassing space for most notifications, such as email and calendar alerts, Facebook and Twitter notifications and more. It can feel like information overload at times, and while it’s convenient to have a home for everything, I was receiving duplicate notifications for Gmail and other apps. Sure, I can turn off one, but then BlackBerry Hub starts to feel less convenient. Also, with two email accounts, several calendars, Twitter and Facebook coming in, the experience got sluggish at times. I suspect BlackBerry can improve this with future updates.. There are some other unique functions that BlackBerry added. The notification shade is tweaked to show apps that have activity – like a notification in Periscope or a breaking news story in CNN. Each just has a red star on it to let you know something is up. Additionally, there’s a function for apps on the home screen that lets you view widgets by swiping down across them. It’s the same batch of widgets that you can apply to your home screen, and they pop up with each swipe. It’s convenient and a nice touch I’d like to see incorporated by other launchers.. BlackBerry’s software also takes advantage of the curved display. A swipe from the side of the screen, where there’s a small customizable bar, will show you a peak at the calendar, BlackBerry Hub, a To-Do list or your favorite contacts. It’s clean and fast, and I mostly used it for quickly peaking at my upcoming calendar appointments. Of all the features BlackBerry loaded on the phone, this is the one I liked most.. BlackBerry takes advantage of the curved display to show a small charging indicator as the phone charges. A line that runs along the edge will increase in size and change from red to yellow to green as the battery juices up. I really enjoyed this feature, but it’s not groundbreaking by any means.. I enjoyed the software in general but will note once again that it’s not all perfect. The system got a bit sluggish at times with a lot of apps running. There were also some bugs that I noticed but Jon didn’t. My system would hang at times and become unresponsive for about 5 seconds. I also ran into an issue where my phone would crash every single time I tried to change the default calendar. I worked with BlackBerry tech support and filed an official bug report, but still don’t have a solution.. Jon never ran into this bug, though he was running slightly newer software that wasn’t available for my AT&T-branded unit. That raises another point worth making: BlackBerry will issue updates faster to phones purchased through ShopBlackBerry.com, so you might want to consider that before buying a carrier-branded unit.. BlackBerry says that the name “Priv” stands for Privacy and Privilege. The latter seems more like marketing speak, but the former is important to most of us in an age where it seems like everyone’s vulnerable to prying eyes. BlackBerry says it bolstered the Android kernel with additional security features like “Hardware Root of Trust,” which the company describes “a hardware-based root of trust is established during processor manufacturing by injecting cryptographic material that’s later used for device authentication and secure boot.” The secure boot sequence guarantees only a BlackBerry signed OS can be booted and constantly analyzes the hardware and software for any tampering.. Most users won’t run into these features, which is sort of the point. BlackBerry wants to offer a secure phone without getting in your hair. There is a compelling application called DTEK that lets you know how secure your device is, and which apps have access to what permissions. An indicator points to red for an insecure phone, yellow for a moderately secure one and green for an excellent security rating. I let Facebook have access to my location, for example, but can prevent other random third-party apps that don’t need my location to function from accessing it. With a device lock screen code active, data encryption active, and factory reset protection on, I had an excellent rating. Leaving developer options on and allowing some apps that I didn’t download from the Google Play Store to run decreased my score a bit.. Sure, there are third party applications that offer what DTEK does, but I have a hard time believing a lot of consumers think about that naturally. It’s nice that BlackBerry puts this front and center.. The BlackBerry Priv features two cameras, a 2-megapixel front-facing camera and an 18-megapixel rear-facing shooter. The primary camera is slow, but churns out some pretty solid pictures in all lighting conditions. I actually went into this review not expecting much from it, considering that BlackBerry’s cameras of late haven’t really wowed me at all. But, turns out, I was wrong.. The camera was reliable and took solid pictures out at dinner in low-light situations, in gray skies out on the golf course, and on sunny days around town. I noticed that it takes about a second to capture, which is slower than most phones these days, and my camera seemed to be slower than Jon’s which was running newer software. That suggests that performance can be tweaked in the future.. I don’t do a lot of filming, but I shot some 4K video using the Priv and it turned out pretty solid when I played it back on the screen. I wish there were other options, like Time Lapse, which I’ve enjoyed using on other devices recently, but it doesn’t have that option natively.. The front-facing camera is pretty laughably bad. The resolution isn’t up to snuff and the colors are all wrong. I often had a blue hue to my face unless the lighting was perfect. Outside on a really bright day, during a football game, the camera was OK. Otherwise, it wasn’t worth using at all. So don’t buy this phone if you’re after really great selfies.. It’s funny, the TechnoBuffalo team was just joking about how we really don’t need a section for “call quality” any longer, since most phones these days are more than capable of performing admirably without frequent dropped calls. I won’t bring back the section yet, but I do want to bring up one issue I had. The BlackBerry Priv had a harder time maintaining a signal inside my apartment than other phones. It typically had about 1 bar or less (no signal at all), while others usually maintain 2-3 bars of service. It didn’t seem to be an issue in any other area than my apartment, but I just wanted to mention it.. As for performance, the Snapdragon 808 processor handled most tasks and gaming just fine. With a bunch of apps running, however, I did notice a slowdown as I moved through the operating system. It was never too bogged down to handle, but there’s a noticeable difference between the Priv and the LG V10, which has the same processor but 4GB of RAM.. I ran an Antutu benchmark for the folks who prefer to hear the raw numbers. It scored a 42,583, which is lower than last year’s Galaxy Note 4, the ZenFone 2, the G4, the MX5, the Moto X Style, the Nexus 6, the M9 and several other phones. In other words, the performance seems to be on a par with last year’s handsets. But, again, this is just a benchmark and didn’t seem to reflect real world performance, which I thought was just fine.. Finally, I was usually able to get through a full day of use out of the BlackBerry Priv. Sometimes I needed to charge at my desk to give myself an extra boost toward the end of the day, just in case I felt I was running low before dinner or something, and that’s when the Quick Charge 2.0 support was appreciated. It’s supported, though the Priv doesn’t ship with a Quick Charge 2.0 charger in the box, so I had to use one I have on hand.. “It’s easily one of the top phones of the year and earns our “Buy” rating.”. I’m not going to beat around the bush, you should buy the BlackBerry Priv. I think many of the folks who are asking whether or not they should buy it are the ones who, for years, have been saying they wished that BlackBerry would just make an Android phone. Well, it’s here now, and you should show your support by buying it.. The BlackBerry Priv performs really well and I dig its focus on security in an age where I feel I can’t be too careful. I really, really like the physical keyboard, which I’m more than accustomed to. I also dig that the camera is good enough, if a bit slow. Pair that with a solid AMOLED Quad HD display and expandable storage, and I really have a phone that checks all the boxes for me.. I think the BlackBerry Priv is a treat – BlackBerry fans are going to love it, and so will Android users. It’s easily one of the top phones of the year and earns our “Buy” rating. As the title says – yep, I’m in love with a BlackBerry again.. I used a BlackBerry Priv I bought from AT&T for 10 days before writing this review.

BlackBerry Priv review: Android alone can't save the company. Sports fans often say that their team could pull itself out of a losing streak if only it'd play that exciting but untested, kid who's usually consigned to the bench. Gadgets fans sing a similar hymn about BlackBerry, opining that it would have remained relevant if it'd adopted Android to run on its phones. Now, several years too late, we're going to see what the long-deposed world champion can do with the world's most popular operating system. The result is the Priv , a premium Android smartphone-cum-hail-Mary that's offering two things other companies can't: Privilege and Privacy. It's also packing a slide-out physical keyboard, a 5.4-inch curved display and, naturally, the company's famous security software. But the device has something else that we've not seen in a BlackBerry phone since the launch of the Q10 : the expectation that the device might actually be worth buying.. Gallery: BlackBerry Priv review | 25 Photos. Mixes the best of BlackBerry and Android. For physical keyboard devotees, there’s not much choice in the smartphone world right now, but BlackBerry does a decent job with the Priv. The high price will deter fair-weather buyers, but if you can’t stand typing on glass, this is your only option.. Hardware "The Priv is probably the best-looking BlackBerry device ever." Display and sound Software. BlackBerry's focus on business customers meant that the firm devoted all of its energies toward making austere smartphones look sexy. Unfortunately, its designers fell into something of a rut, knocking out devices from a rote list that included a matte black body with silver buttons and little else. The adoption of a sliding, physical keyboard has forced those atrophied creative muscles to spring into life, and that can only be a good thing. That's because the Priv is probably the best-looking BlackBerry device that has ever been made. Yes, the matte black and silver buttons are still there, but the phone's curved screen adds a much-needed dose of humanity. Then there's the way that it feels in the hand, since the 9.4mm thickness makes it a heifer compared to the 7mm-thick Galaxy S6 Edge. BlackBerry, however, cannily tapered the edges of the phone to mirror the display, making it feel a lot thinner than it actually is.. BlackBerry's legendary reputation for making devices that feel as if they can take a beating remains intact, too. I had expected the Priv to feel flimsy given that sliders, by definition, have several more points of mechanical failure compared to a regular bar smartphone. It may be made of two separate parts, but I couldn't find any bend or flex in my review unit -- at least at the limits I was prepared to try and twist it. The Priv has a woven glass fiber back and a Gorilla Glass 4 display coating, so I'm expecting it to last well beyond the two years that most people's phone contracts run to.. Starting with the front of the device, you'll see the BlackBerry logo nestled below the earpiece, ambient light sensor, forward-facing camera and notification light. Just beneath that is the 5.43-inch screen, while in the chin of the device you'll find the forward-facing speaker array and primary microphone. On the top side you'll find the microSD slot that can accept cards up to 2TB, as well as the SIM tray -- the opposite end houses the micro-USB 2.0 port. You'll find the sleep/wake button on the left hand side, with the trio of volume and mute buttons on the opposite edge.. The phone stands 147mm tall au naturel , but if you slide out the keyboard, that measurement increases to 184mm. If you weren't looking too closely at the publicity stills, you might have missed that the Priv's keyboard isn't the fretted sort you'll find on the company's other handsets. Instead, it's a custom affair that, like the BlackBerry Passport, is also capable of recognizing simple gestures. Each key is tightly spaced and if, like me, you have fat fingers, it'll take a while to get your eye in, but there's a surprising amount of travel given its size. Like the Passport, if a word hits the autocomplete suggestion bar, a hard swipe up on the keyboard will add it to your message.. I don't think that it's unfair to say that BlackBerry really only has two strengths anymore: its mobile keyboard know-how and its device security. Why, then, did it not give some serious consideration to just cramming in a Classic keyboard into this device? I mean, this variation is generally fine and after some practice, you'll be using it like it's 2008 all over again, it's just a shame , you know?. BlackBerry saw fit to equip the Priv with a 5.43-inch plastic AMOLED display with a 2,560 x 1,440 resolution and a pixel density of 540 ppi. That puts it just behind the Galaxy S6 Edge (577 ppi) and just ahead of the LG G4 (538 ppi). Using AMOLED means brighter, warmer colors and enables BlackBerry to add a slight curve to the Priv's display, at the expense of accurate color reproduction. Then again, if you're buying a BlackBerry phone, surely you're not clamoring for a faithful and accurate representation of a true color landscape, right? Suffice it to say, if you're watching a 1080p movie on this thing, you'll find high-definition videos look stunning with deep blacks and vivid colors.. Unlike, say, the Android app launcher you'll find on Samsung's Note Edge, BlackBerry hasn't seen fit to do much with the sloping sides of its curved screen. The only really worthwhile use, so far, is that when the display is off and charging, a green power indicator bar runs up the right-hand curve. It's rather sweet, since it creeps towards the top of the device the fuller your battery gets. Again, not a groundbreaking piece of work, but it's a cute touch from a company that's rarely known for such fripperies.. Audio-wise, the bottom of the chin is given over to a short, but wide speaker hidden behind a band of laser-drilled holes. It's no HTC BoomSound (what is?) but the setup is clear enough to provide mono sound for a whole room. In one of my weirder tests, I put the device under two pillows at the other end of my home office and found that the sound, while muffled, was still enough to kick off an impromptu dance party.. There's some good / bad news for BlackBerry 10 devotees whose muscle memory means that they insta-swipe right to get to the BlackBerry hub. It may be on the device, but it's been removed from its normal resting place on the left of the home screen. In its place, however, is the Productivity Hub, a breakdown of your schedule and any important messages that can be accessed by pulling a small white tab on the left-sided curve of the screen.. The Priv uses a slightly customized version of Android 5.1.1 (Lollipop), although the biggest changes are all under the hood. In order to make the operating system secure enough for BlackBerry to slap its logo on it, the firm had to add a cryptographic key at the hardware level, harden the Linux kernel and create the Dtek security app to monitor user activity. If you're curious about Lollipop, please point your browsers to our review from a year ago , although the company has confirmed to us that a Marshmallow update is in the works and should be made available within the next six months.. The rest of the most noticeable changes are cosmetic rather than functional, like the inclusion of the BlackBerry splat on an icon to highlight when you have an unread notification. Aping BlackBerry 10's design, the default home screen is no longer at the center of a carousel, but on the left-most pane, forcing you to push additional shortcuts further out to the right. In addition, the app tray is now one continuously scrolling-selection, because if you swipe to the side, you'll be given access to customizable widgets and shortcuts.. Gallery: BlackBerry Priv screenshots | 21 Photos. BlackBerry is clearly preaching to the choir here, ditching some of Android's more unique navigation features to impose its own system. It's personal preference, but I think that it's more elegant, and I'm one of a minority that backs Huawei's controversial decision to eliminate the app tray from its own versions of Android. I'm also sure that this move is likely to rankle Android devotees, and it's weird how you get such easy access to widget options and shortcuts at the expense of a more easily-navigable app tray.. As mentioned, the other big addition is Dtek, the company's security suite that sits on top of Android and nannies you into making sure your device is difficult to hack and steal. When I was setting up the device, I skipped the option to add a security pin, and Dtek quickly started nagging me to change that situation. After a while, I gave in, and wanted to see if it could tell I was being deliberately lax by choosing 1234 as my code. Unfortunately, the app didn't push back, and with the addition of that one code, my security level went from being "weak" to "excellent.". BlackBerry has never really been too fussed with smartphone imaging, with the Passport being the first of its devices to even get a double-digit camera sensor. As if to overcompensate, the Priv comes with an 18-megapixel Schneider-Kreuznach-certified imaging sensor. In addition, the firm is throwing the usual bundle of features that high-end smartphones get in order to claim that they can operate on equal footing with a DSLR. In this case, that means optical image stabilization (OIS), phase-detect auto focus and the ability to record 4K video at 30fps as well as the software-based live image filters we've already seen in older BlackBerry 10 devices. The front-facer, meanwhile, is a garden-variety 2-megapixel affair with 720p video capture and 2x digital zoom that can do panoramic selfies, should you need it.. Gallery: BlackBerry Priv camera samples | 46 Photos. "Claims of it being able to replace your DSLR are, as usual, bull."

Paw through the sample images and you should be reasonably impressed at the quality of pictures this device can produce. I say "can" because there's no guarantee that the image that you see pop up on that AMOLED screen is the one you're going to find when viewing it on alternative display. In addition, there can be some inconsistency in the color between two shots taken at exactly the same location. Take a look at the last two shots in this gallery (the shot of the railway lines) and you'll see a pair of images snapped one after the other. Except one has a blueish tint and the other has more faithful reproduction.. The pictures taken at night (during a particularly foggy week) are a little nosier than I'd prefer, but a little tweaking of the on-screen exposure wheel can improve that slightly. There's at least a few shots in near pitch-darkness (in the woods close to my home) that I was expecting not to come out at all that had some measure of detail in them. Overall, while any claims of it being able to replace your DSLR are, as usual, bull, it's not a bad camera to have in your pocket.. In recent years, BlackBerry excused itself from the spec wars, preferring instead to rely upon outdated chipsets to run inside its smartphones. Part of that was because BB10 wasn't particularly resource-hungry and, you know, because it had to cut costs somewhere. By comparison, the Priv has been created with a "spare no expense" mantra that's worthy of the fictional creator of Jurassic Park, John Hammond. The device has a 1.8GHz hexa-core 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 chip paired with 3GB RAM and 32GB of built-in storage.. It's important to remember that while BlackBerry produces smartphones, it's never made a pure Android device before. As such, the device's staggeringly quick real-world performance is worthy of comment, given that it's produced it from a standing start. Naturally, this is partly due to the sledgehammer that is the chip-and-RAM combo here, but BlackBerry has clearly done some work behind the scenes as well. I much prefer to compare the real-world performance of the device, too, because if you went by its benchmarks alone, you'd think that the Priv was about as fast as an agricultural vehicle.. You see, at the time that I was reviewing the BlackBerry Priv, I was also testing Sony's Xperia Z5, and had assumed that the latter would probably stand ahead of the former in the real world. As such, I did some side-by-side loading tests to see which of the pair could crank demanding apps like Asphalt 8 and Dead Trigger 2 the fastest. As it turned out, both devices managed to load levels within a second of each other -- Sony winning the first heat, the Priv returning the favor in the second, and so forth. It's an unscientific test, sure, but you can rest assured that this device can stand side-by-side with the big boys.. One thing that BlackBerry 10 phones have historically struggled with is call quality, and the firm's much-hyped Paratek Adaptive aerial technology never really amounted to much. The company claims that the Priv is even more call-friendly, since it packs in 11 antennas inside its svelte frame. As such, I had a few long, romantic chats with my fellow Engadget editors on Three's network here in the UK. As far as they were concerned, my audio was tinny and somehow choked-off, as if the full gamut of my speech was being erased from the chat by the phone's secondary, sound-canceling microphones.. The Priv ships with a non-removable, 3,410mAh battery, which is more capacious than both the Galaxy Note 5 (3,000mAh) and the S6 Edge (2,600mAh). Despite this massive battery, the company only rated it for 22 hours of mixed use which, to me, felt a little suspect. In my experience of reviewing BlackBerry phones, you can normally divide that figure in half and get close to what it's going to get in test conditions. In our standard rundown test, we loop a HD video with brightness set to 50 percent and the Priv managed to last 12 hours and 23 minutes.. If I'm honest, that surprised me, since it never seemed to be capable of lasting that long during my day-to-day use. For instance, the day I received the handset, I charged it fully and then began the setup process, which took about an hour. Unfortunately, just an hour of use managed to eat away 20 percent of the device's battery life, so while video playback will do for the duration of most long-haul flights, you'll struggle to achieve similar results day to day.. At this point it's probably safe to say that BlackBerry doesn't have a lot of competition, since no other major firm produces an Android smartphone with a keyboard. The only reasonably new device that comes close to the Priv's hardware would be a Galaxy S6 Edge paired with one of the Korean firm's bolt-on keyboards .. If you're looking for a secure Android phone, meanwhile, the only other mainstream alternative would be a Samsung Knox device -- again, leading you back to the Galaxy S6 Edge ( amongst others ). The only other device that readily comes to mind is Silent Circle's BlackPhone 2 , which makes similar claims to be able to protect your privacy.. Otherwise, the field of competition is pretty barren, and if you're just looking for a physical keyboard, the only other option is BlackBerry 10 devices. Right now you have a choice of two: the wide-framed Passport or the Classic , both of which come with the firm's trademark frets.. BlackBerry is probably done as a phone manufacturer, and John Chen has pledged to shut down the division if it doesn't turn a profit by 2016. That's not going to be possible, not through any fault of BlackBerry, but because almost no Android manufacturer seems to be able to turn a decent profit on smartphones these days. As much as it makes sense that BlackBerry could, or should, have adopted Android four years ago, there's no guarantee that it would have prolonged its life much beyond now anyway.. The BlackBerry Priv, then, is one part hail Mary and one part fan service, and that $699 price tag is going to scare off fair-weather customers. Despite spending this time with the BlackBerry Priv, I'm still not sure if that's a good thing or not, because there are plenty of things that I like about it. I like how it looks, how it feels and how well-built it is. The tweaks to Android are sensible too, regardless of how you feel about BlackBerry Hub.. But then there's that slightly lackluster keyboard, which isn't bad, but isn't as glorious as what you'd expect from a BlackBerry device. Since a physical input mechanism is the phone's raison d'etre , surely the company would have been better off just cramming a full-sized one in, somehow? After all, if you've gone to the trouble of cleaving the phone in two and building a, frankly killer, sliding mechanism, better to go the whole hog, right?. I guess the final test is to ask myself if I could, with a straight face, recommend this to my friends and loved ones. The only person who I know would like this is the one that scours eBay whenever his Motorola Pro+ breaks, which it does, frequently. The fact that a company in 2015 is making a pretty decent Android smartphone with a keyboard deserves plenty of praise, because people do still crave them. I just can't imagine anyone who has become inured to using an on-screen keyboard will consider dropping seven hundred big ones to go back to how it was..

It turns out BlackBerry can make one hell of an Android phone.. A quality mobile experience means different things to different people, but a universal core to those experiences is the ability to enjoy using your phone without it feeling like work, even when you are using it specifically for work. BlackBerry has a long history of making people more productive through mobile experiences, but in an age where smartphones are used for play significantly more often than they are used for work, a new kind of balance needs to be struck without sacrificing those things that make us productive on smartphones. The Priv may not be the answer for everyone, but it's an answer no one else has come up with recently.. BlackBerry has assembled a thoroughly enjoyable piece of hardware, and while the BlackBerry/Android software mashup isn't perfect it's a solid first attempt.. BlackBerry software occasionally gets in the way. Front-facing camera is a little weak. One hell of an Android phone. Remember when a physical keyboard was a must on a smartphone? The act of typing more than 140 characters on a software keyboard was downright frustrating for many. Times have changed quite a bit, as not only have touch screens gotten really good but the software driving those keyboards has improved dramatically as well. Some rely on tracing and algorithms to predict your language and make it seem like typing is easier on glass, and for the hardware manufacturers that's a really good thing.. Keyboards on smartphones are expensive, especially if phones are supposed to keep getting thinner and lighter and cheaper and more powerful all at the same time. Cutting out the keyboard made this a lot less complicated, and made focusing on the commodity pricing to carve out market share while competing in design fairly trivial in comparison.. Are there still people out there who love a physical keyboard? Absolutely. Is there a company out there still making great keyboards? Absolutely. Are those phones running an OS that grants us access to the latest apps and features we Android fans love so much? Absolutely not. BlackBerry, the All-Father of smartphones, has decided to take a step left of its BB10 platform and give Android a shot. This means doing a lot more than just slapping Google's OS on something with the BlackBerry logo on it, though. For this to work, BlackBerry needs to take the things that make its phones special and integrate it with Android in a way that appeals to a new group of users without walking away from its loyal and loving audience. The first attempt is called the BlackBerry Priv, and it's the start of something new and exciting by resurrecting things that are neither new nor particularly exciting, which is kind of fantastic.. I (Russell Holly) am writing this review after one week with the BlackBerry Priv. This 32GB BlackBerry Priv, which is running Android 5.1.1 (Build AAC826) was used primarily in Glen Burnie, Md on AT&T, an area which is mostly powered by an LTE network.. A Moto 360 2015 was paired to the phone for most of the review.. 5.43-inch dual curve Quad HD display. ƒ/2.2, optical image stabilization, dual-LED dual-color flash, BSI sensor. 4K 30fps and 1080p 60fps video. Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 hexa-core 64-bit processor. 2x1.8GHz Cortex-A57 cores + 4x1.44Ghz Cortex-A53 cores. Contextual auto-correct, word prediction, and learning engine. In a world where everyone wants phones to be almost all screen on the front with a battery big enough to get you through the day while simultaneously being thin and powerful, it's not easy to find room for a physical keyboard. Throw in the ability to comfortably use the phone with one hand and not have the entire experience feel cheap, and you've got a list of things most of the companies working without keyboards are struggling to functionally accomplish. The BlackBerry Priv hits all of these marks with ease, which is nothing short of impressive.. The soft-touch back of the phone is standard BlackBerry fare, and it's the good stuff. In fact, it might be a little too grippy for some. The material absorbs everything nearby, including fingerprints, stray hairs and whatever is in the bottom of your pocket right now. I found a dime once, just below the seven identical shapes that make up the BlackBerry logo, which is also covered in this soft-touch material. It covers everything that is matte black, wrapping with a sharp curve around to the sides where the metal trim starts and all around the speaker grille on the front of the phone.. The only thing not soft-touch in this matte black space are the four buttons that live on the sides of the phone. These polished metal buttons are for power, volume up, volume down, and a quick mute button when audio is playing, which is fairly standard for a BlackBerry phone but a little different for Android users. The power button sits alone on the left side of the phone, high enough that you're unlikely to press it accidentally but low enough that your thumb rests just below it when holding the phone with your left hand. These buttons stick out just enough to be tactile, and offer a satisfying click when pressed.. A slightly less polished version of the metal that comprises these buttons makes up the frame of the display, which you can feel along every edge just above the glass so as to protect the phone when set face down. Similar to Samsung's Galaxy S6 edge and edge+ , the glass front to the BlackBerry Priv is curved. This curve is longer and more gradual than the soft-touch curve on the back, because the 5.43-inch AMOLED display is also curved on this phone. The only break in this curved glass is at the very top, where a small speaker grill lives for phone calls.. The end result is a phone that feels remarkably good when held with a single hand. Reaching across the display is comfortable thanks to the curves on the front and back, and although there are two speaker grilles on the front of this phone it is clear your primary audio source for music and the like is the much larger speaker on the bottom of the phone. The BlackBerry Priv is easily the most comfortable to hold plastic phone to have been made this year, and despite being on the larger end when looking at the screen size it feels a lot more like you're holding something like the Nexus 5X thanks to the design.. Oh right, and when you apply pressure on the display with both of your thumbs you find a full qwerty keyboard.. Sliding the display up is buttery smooth, requiring little force and gliding flawlessly up the track. At around the halfway point, the slider mechanism takes hold and guides the display up the rest of the way, so there's no loud clack as the two sides collide. It's a gentle, smooth transition that feels like a well-made piece of equipment. With the display fully extended, you'll notice the back of the display has the same metal from the trim across the back, along with the grooves that make up part of the slider mechanism.. BlackBerry has crafted an exceptional little computer.. The plastic bed to the keyboard lacks the soft-touch coating, but matches the color of the rest of the phone nicely. The backlit keys that pulse to life as the keyboard is revealed is unmistakably BlackBerry. Each key has a raised angle to it so you can press without mashing multiple keys, and with both thumbs over the keyboard you can reach everything with ease. Each key press feels like its own individual key on the board, with just the right amount of tactile response to confirm the key has been pressed. It's everything a four-row keyboard needs to be, and it's the kind of thing BlackBerry has gotten very good at building.. BlackBerry has crafted an exceptional little computer. It looks great, feels solid, and the design works hard to make this phone feel smaller than it is. The only thing about this experience that doesn't scream quality is a slight squish you get by pushing just below the BlackBerry logo, where there's a little gap between the plastic back and the battery compartment underneath. This could have something to do with our review models lacking wireless charging, since BlackBerry assures us all models sold through ShopBlackBerry and all US carrier versions will include this feature. Running BlackBerry 10, this would be an amazing little powerhouse not many people would use. Fortunately for us this is the BlackBerry Priv, powered by Android.. Lots and lots of optional options. While a combination of leaks and BlackBerry's slow promotional drip has made this phone one of the worst kept secrets of all time, there's a lot to talk about when it comes to the software powering the Priv. At first glance, this phone appears to be an almost Nexus-style Android experience. BlackBerry did this on purpose to make Android users feel more at home on this phone, but it doesn't take too many taps and swipes to see there's a whole lot of BlackBerry under this Material smokescreen.. BlackBerry's take on Android 5.1.1 starts with a homescreen with buttons and icons similar to the Google Now Launcher, but opening the actual launcher reveals three tabs and some sort options for your apps. This launcher holds your widgets like a lot of other Android 5.0+ launchers, but also has a tab for BlackBerry Shortcuts. These icons are meant to be placed on the homescreen like apps, but instead of opening the app to the landing screen or whatever you were just doing in that app, shortcuts take you to a specific activity. Most of these shortcuts are for BlackBerry functions, like messaging someone on BlackBerry Messenger or adding a calendar entry. If you scroll down far enough, you see shortcuts for quick settings functions and eventually support for Google apps like Inbox, Slides, and Maps. There are currently no third party apps in this Shortcuts menu, but if you're using BlackBerry or Google apps there's a reasonable chance you'll find something useful in there to try out.. Next up is the notification tray. At first glance this is a standard Google notification tray, complete with two swipes for quick settings and expandable notifications. Once you get a bunch of notifications, however, you see things are a little different. There's a gap in between your notifications and the settings panel where icons for supported apps will show up. If you tap on that icon, all of the notifications related to that app will appear and everything else will hide for a moment. It'd be cool idea for a quick glance if the app supported everything, but currently that's not the case. Third party apps that aren't supported show up in the regular notification lineup but nowhere else, and the notification icon doesn't distinguish between actual notifications and status messages. This means you occasionally get extra notification space for things like file upload confirmation, which doesn't help anyone.. You notifications also live on your homescreen now, thanks to the BlackBerry asterisk. This red icon sits in the top right corner of your app icon on the homescreen when there's any kind of notification for that app, so you know there's something to check out. You already know there's something to check out, because there's already an icon in your notification tray, but that is another matter entirely. This asterisk icon becomes even less useful when your app is in a folder, as the asterisk moves to the top right corner of the folder. Since the folder UI shows you the first four things you have in that folder on the homescreen, it frequently looks like there is activity on one app when reality is a little different. Ultimately this is a legacy BlackBerry thing that will make existing BB10 users who are making the switch feel more at home, but the less-than-helpful redundancy is likely to send veteran Android users looking for a replacement launcher.. This may seem strange, but one of the biggest parts of the software experience on the BlackBerry Priv is the physical keyboard.. A large part of the rest of the BlackBerry software experience is catering to BlackBerry users, which is a good thing. It's a necessary thing, and it's something that can either be done really well or absolutely horribly. Fortunately for everyone involved, BlackBerry chose the former. Every other part of the BlackBerry experience is opt-in. This includes BlackBerry Messenger, BlackBerry Hub, and something called the Productivity Tab. BlackBerry Messenger is something everyone knows about already, it's the messaging client BlackBerry has championed for years now, and you either love it or can't stand it. BlackBerry Hub is a clever way to organize all of your communication mechanisms in a single place, all in a single timeline to sort through and interact with. This includes social networking apps, messaging apps, and of course email. This is also one of those things you either love or cant stand, but as a workflow management system BlackBerry Hub is unparalleled. You have to give it everything in order to be totally functional, but if you actually do that there's a good chance you'll find the workflow compelling.. Productivity Tab is another monster entirely. It's this unassuming little tab that floats to the right of everything on all of your screens, and when you swipe across it you're taken to a quick glance at your calendar, task list, BlackBerry Hub, and contacts list. It's a great tool for quickly grabbing information when sending a message and you need to confirm something like a schedule or a phone number, and BlackBerry gives you a lot of control over where it lives on the screen and how obtrusive it is. Perhaps most important, it looks nice and it highly functional. BlackBerry did a great job making it work so well with the curved screen on the Priv, so you can swipe in from the side and quickly take advantage of these features when you want them.. This may seem like a strange sentence to read, but one of the biggest parts of the software experience on the BlackBerry Priv is the physical keyboard. This keyboard is a whole lot more than four rows of buttons for text input, which is important because with the screen slid up this phone is really tall. For starters the entire keyboard is capacitive, which means you can swipe your finger across the keyboard itself and the swipe is registered on the screen. This includes swiping left and right on the homescreen to jump from one page to another and scrolling up and down on websites and in apps. When typing on the keyboard, a row of word suggestions appears on the screen just like it would for a software keyboard. Swiping up on the keyboard under those words will set them in your existing sentence as though you had tapped on the screen, so your thumbs never have to leave the keyboard when typing.. Accessing your ALT keyboard happens on screen as well. Swiping down on the keyboard causes a virtual keyboard to appear on the screen, but instead of showing you what you already have on your keyboard you get secondary options like punctuation and the number pad. You can access these things with the ALT key on the keyboard, but sometimes it's faster to move up to the glass for those quick punctuation grabs. The only downside to this feature is it requires the BlackBerry software keyboard to be set as the active keyboard in order to work properly, and while the BlackBerry physical keyboard is awesome its software keyboard isn't quite as capable as many of the Android software keyboards.. The rest of this software experience is quite similar to Google's vision for Android, which BlackBerry says was on purpose. This is a setup Android veterans and BlackBerry faithful can set up to create the experience they are most comfortable with, and there's very little about this setup that forces either side of that equation to delve to deep into the other side of things unless they want to. Also, and we can't stress enough just how amazing this really is, despite this being an AT&T version of the BlackBerry Priv there are no carrier-fed bloatware apps to be found on this phone. It's a worthy compromise, and outside of a few bugs we found where BlackBerry Hub ate notifications so they didn't appear in the notification tray, it's a solid setup that is both fast and capable.. Naturally the big question asked as soon as we sat down with BlackBerry was when this phone would expect to see Android 6.0, but the closest thing we got to a solid answer was "sometime after the new year." While it doesn't look like BlackBerry made a ton of changes to the software, which would suggest updating would be quick and mostly painless, there's a lot going on under the hood here that will cause some delays on BlackBerry's end. Fortunately for everyone, BlackBerry is assuring everyone there's going to be very little delay in things like security patches, which will be rolling out no later than one month after Google makes them public.. As secure as you choose to be. BlackBerry Priv Security and privacy. A big focus for BlackBerry with the Priv is going to be how secure and safe this phone is compared to the other experiences out there, that requires both a careful explanation and a deep look at how accurate those claims actually are. For BlackBerry, Priv stands for Privilege and Privacy. It says so right on the box, but what does that actually mean?. For starters, the BlackBerry Priv is certified for FIPS 140-2 Data at Rest and Data in Transit. This means there's a certified cryptographic module being used to keep data encrypted on the phone, and there's a physical tamper seal in the phone to let you know if the hardware portion has been tampered with or compromised. BlackBerry attributes part of this to a proprietary mechanism for encrypting the data on the Priv, and while that sounds exciting it means there are big parts of this experience that are just about as far from open source as you can get.. BlackBerry also claims to have hardened the linux kernel that powers the Android OS, but isn't currently going into specifics. The promise here is it would be a lot more complicated for low level exploits to happen on the Priv, and it's the kind of promise we will undoubtedly see tested sooner rather than later.. The end result of all this is a series of tools that could make you more secure if you choose to use them.. This is BlackBerry working to keep the data on your phone encrypted at all times, and they are doing so in a way that is functionally different from the way Google is currently doing it on its Nexus products. This difference has been certified for use in places that don't usually let you wander in with any phone you'd find on the street, which is BlackBerry's bread and butter.. In userspace, BlackBerry has added the DTEK app to keep an eye on you as a user. It's a fairly standard security app, themed with BlackBerry stylings and built to let you know when things are either potential risks or misbehaving. If you leave Developer Options on and ADB enabled, for example, DTEK will lower you security rating and tell you why. If you use a less secure lockscreen, or you aren't using a lockscreen at all, your overall security rating will drop even further. It's not something you'll be using particularly often, and it's not going to keep you safe from anything that would attempt to access your data under the UI, but it's a good way to encourage users to be more aware and secure in their personal lives.. BlackBerry has also moved its picture lockscreen to Android, and if you've never used it before it might become your new favorite thing. Rather than a pattern or pin someone could see by glancing over your shoulder, picture lock places a grid of random numbers on the screen for you to interact with. You choose a number and a destination when creating the lock, and when you go to unlock the phone you pull the entire page of numbers around until one of the iterations of the number you chose lines up in the location you designated. It's hard to imagine how anyone could figure out your lock by looking over your shoulder with this, but the flip side is it becomes a little more challenging to unlock the phone in direct sunlight.. The end result of all this is a series of tools that could make you more secure if you choose to use them, and coupled with BlackBerry's promise to work with Google to get security patches on the Priv within a month of its release, it means this is going to be among the more secure phones on the market today. It's an important thing to think about, whether you're looking at a smartphone as an entertainment vehicle or a business appliance, and BlackBerry has all the pieces in place for a great experience for both kinds of users.. Business in the front, party in the back. You don't hear many people talk about how excited they are to use the camera on a BlackBerry, and while a good bit of that has to do with the current core audience it's clear smartphone photography and camera features have never really been a focus for this company. Cameras on BlackBerry phones have always been good enough, but never really exceptional or packed with a ton of features. The BlackBerry Priv is in a different ecosystem, and its potential audience has watched a year of truly exceptional smartphone cameras paraded before them in spectacular fashion. This means something more than just a decent sensor and a simple app are needed to help this camera stand out. The rear camera on this phone manages this with little problem. The front camera, not so much.. An 18MP camera bulges out from the back of the BlackBerry Priv, with a metal ring around the glass to protect the lens from fingers or laying the phone on its back. This Optical Image Stabilization-enhanced camera works with a simple BlackBerry camera app to ensure taking photos is quick and easy, with results that will satisfy all but the most serious of phonetographers.. Color reproduction is great, and taking the shot even with shaky hands or a moving scene more often than not ends with a decent photo. Even in low light, this camera performs above average. The only real downfall here is the time it takes to capture an image. While a single snap isn't usually more than a quarter second away from the moment you tapped the button, HDR shots often take noticeably longer and if you're using BlackBerry's live filters the normal capture can lag a little as well.. BlackBerry offers an additional Enhanced Video Stabilization when recording video, but only when shooting in 1080p at 30fps. If you make the jump to 60fps or you increase the resolution to 4K, this feature is automatically disabled. The stabilization difference is noticeable enough that you'll miss it if you lack steady hands or you're recording in a moving car, and because the resolution settings are inside a separate menu in the camera app there's a good chance you won't think about it when capturing a quick video of something happening right that second. It's not a huge deal either way, but a quick toggle on the primary UI for the camera would have gone a long way here.. The front facing camera tries really hard to be a decent camera, but in 2015 a 2MP sensor just isn't going to compete with the 5MP and 8MP offerings we've seen from the competition this year. Backgrounds frequently appear blown out if it's a bright day, and there's not enough detail to really appreciate some of the features BlackBerry has included in this app. The Panoramic Selfie mode, for example, does a fantastic job capturing a wide image with very little stitching errors, but frequently the detail beyond the content a foot or two from the camera is lacking.. BlackBerry's camera setup for the Priv is more than adequate for most users out there. The rear camera does a great job capturing quick images and video, and unless you are a relentless selfie fiend you'll probably find the front camera good enough to get by. More than anything, BlackBerry's offering highlights just how ridiculously good smartphone cameras have gotten over the past year in order for these criticisms to hold any actual weight.. A remarkable union of function and experience. Physical keyboards have been a part of the Android experience from day one , but their miserable fade from existence on this platform left a bad taste in a lot of mouths. The last couple of Android phones with physical keyboards weren't very good, and a lot of that had to do with cost cutting to stay competitive or a constant battle with the Android OS and its apps when it came to landscape sliders. The portrait slider on the BlackBerry Priv is exceptional in every way, and using it every day quickly highlighted how differently many of us use our phones without a physical keyboard.. Sending a quick message on a virtual keyboard is fast and effortless nowadays, which is awesome. Load up your favorite tracing keyboard or learning keyboard and before long you can type noticeably faster than most people ever would on a physical smartphone keyboard. That speed is what made the switch so easy, because it didn't feel like we were actually missing out on anything anymore. Where that starts to fall apart for some is when you go to type for extended periods of time. After a couple of sentences, typing on these virtual keyboards is exhausting. Whether it's doubling back every couple of words to correct the mistakes the trace keyboard made or your suggestion keyboard has corrected public to Pub for the fourth time in an email to your boss because you frequently invite your friends to come drinking, virtual keyboards still aren't great at more than a paragraph for a lot of people.. This is one of the biggest reasons BlackBerry still has a physical keyboard, and the difference is clear. A full third of this review was written on a BlackBerry Priv while doing things like waiting to pick kids up from school or standing in the checkout line, which is something that would never happen on Google's fantastic trace keyboard or SwiftKey's amazing suggestion keyboard. Those are without a doubt the two options to reach for when taking a quick note or for sending a tweet, but BlackBerry still owns the long game and that's significant for some folks.. It makes a noticeable difference in how you use your phone on a day to day basis, which is why BlackBerry stuffed a 3410 mAh battery into this phone. Long form typing means the 5.4-inch display is on for quite a while as you type, but you still have to be able to get through the day. Days with heavy typing often ended with more than five hours of screen on time, which meant on days where the phone was disconnected from power at 6 a.m. the 15 percent warning would show up at around 10:30 p.m. On days where the phone was used more like we use the Nexus 5X or Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+, by 10:30 p.m. that battery would be a lot closer to 40 percent remaining. This is a phone that will have zero problems getting most people through a full day.. Audio quality is also great when using the headphone jack, which you'd expect given the rest of the experience on the phone.. Another remarkably well implemented part of the BlackBerry Priv is the bottom speaker. This front facing speaker is louder than most, and produces audio that easily competes with HTC's BoomSound speakers. Gaming, movies, and music all sound great, though admittedly one sided if you're holding the phone landscape. Audio quality is also great when using the headphone jack, which you'd expect given the rest of the experience on the phone. When testing with our Audio-Technica ATH-M50 headphones the Priv delivered audio comparable to the HTC One M9 , which is to say the highs and mids come in nice and clear but the lows are occasionally a little on the muddy side. It's better than most smartphone audio experiences, but not quite as compelling as the LG V10 .. Finally, the 2560x1440 display on the BlackBerry Priv wants for very little. The colors on the screen look great, though predictably saturated as this is an AMOLED display. Text is nice and sharp, and at max brightness the display is usable in sunlight. There's still nothing that holds a candle to the ridiculous outdoor mode Samsung has in its phones this year, but outside of those screens this is easily one of the better displays you can get on a phone today. It's also worth pointing out that the more subtle curve of the glass on the BlackBerry Priv makes the edges of the display a lot more usable outdoors than the Galaxy S6 edge or edge+, as there are a great deal fewer reflections to compete with.. Should you buy it? Absolutely.. Who knew that we'd get to 2015 and one of the more capable manufacturers of Android phones would be BlackBerry? The notion is fantastic and bizarre at the same time, but there's little about this phone we don't like, and that is good news for everyone. It's a great all around phone when closed, and the physical keyboard takes that experience over the top and directly competes with the current top of the line Android phones. It's a serious phone for serious people, but it's also a whole lot of fun and built to be entertaining. It's also running a decent, reasonably secure adaptation of Android, which is a huge plus for everyone.. The BlackBerry Priv deserves its $699 price tag. It's an experience that completely justifies the price, which isn't something we get to say about the high end of the smartphone market often enough anymore. While it's true the mid range has gotten really good and the cost of phones like the Nexus 6P has gone a long way towards demanding manufacturers justify a higher price point, BlackBerry has absolutely done that with the Priv. This needs to be the start of a long relationship between BlackBerry and Android, as it sets a new standard for the kind of quality we as users should demand from high end smartphones.. This may not be the experience for everyone, and that's ok. Some folks are limited by cost, while others are perfectly happy with Google's Nexus 6P (as well you should, it's an amazing phone in its own right). Anyone looking for something a little different, or anyone interested in returning to a world where physical keyboards are a thing need to give the BlackBerry Priv a serious look.. This is absolutely one of the best phones to be released this year, and while BlackBerry still has to demonstrate it can keep its promises when it comes to software updates this is already an exceptional experience. It's only going to get better from here.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

Michael Fisher November 18, 2015 6:59 pm. After over a week with the BlackBerry Priv, I’m still not entirely convinced it’s real. I was joking when I tweeted that it felt like a phone from an alternate universe, but just barely.. If you told me the Priv was a prop from the set of a 2005-era science fiction movie, some decade-old concept for what the future of BlackBerry would be, I’d probably believe you. That’s a testament to the level of consistency BlackBerry has achieved with the Priv:. no matter what else it is, at its core it’s still a BlackBerry.. expensive, disadvantages that have in the past been offset by the BlackBerry’s reputation as a productivity powerhouse. In 2005, if you wanted to get things done on the go, you bought a BlackBerry (in fact, the company’s BB 7520 was my first smartphone ). The competition has grown up, and now almost. can be pressed into service as an office assistant, while the new crop of Windows Phones can. fully-fledged desktop computers given the right hardware.. no longer need a BlackBerry to get things done.. It’s this new climate the BlackBerry Priv was designed to tackle.. trading the placid consistency of the BlackBerry OS for the vibrant ecosystem of Android. make itself appealing to a new class of prosumer: one who doesn’t mind paying a little extra for some. a surprisingly good smartphone, but one that needs some big changes before it can be called a success.. Portrait-oriented sliders are rare enough that when one shows up on the scene it generally makes a splash – but. the BlackBerry Priv makes an impression even. Its Quad HD P-OLED display is spacious at 5.4″ and absolutely gorgeous under the. Gorilla Glass 4 lens, which curves gently at the edges. to meet the Priv’s rounded sides.. The cover glass stops short of the phone’s bottom lip to make room for a loud and clear front-firing speaker whose grille takes up the entire width of. Up top, sharing space with the earpiece is the BlackBerry brand name, which is flanked by one of the company’s oldest trademarks: a bright notification LED that flashes a brilliant red by default.. While the glass weave material is attractive in a rugged sort of way, it suffers from a startling amount of give when pressed. The effect is not unlike the “trampoline” problem faced by some. Nexus 9 tablets: even a light press on the Priv’s. the material dipping into a seemingly large. It goes without saying that that’s not the sort of fit and finish. a $700 smartphone, especially when manufacturers like OnePlus are delivering top-notch build quality. for a third the price of the Priv.. On the plus side, the back cover. the grippiest soft-touch coating we’ve ever come across. While that means it picks up more than its share of dust and fuzz, it also makes the Priv very easy to keep a grip on when you slide its screen out of the way to reveal its most distinctive feature.. If you’re coming from another BlackBerry, you’ll probably be a little let down by the Priv’s QWERTY thumbpad. While the company deserves serious credit. for managing to fit such an intricate assembly into a chassis. the lack of space means the keys don’t offer. the travel or mechanical feedback BlackBerrys have come to be known for. as those on the Classic , and they’re not as spacious as those on the Passport .. But this is one of those areas where BlackBerry’s sub-1% market share might work to its advantage. A large portion of the Priv’s potential. audience, those Android and iOS users who haven’t. laid thumbs on a “crackberry” in years, will probably find a lot to like in the Priv’s contoured clackers. That includes us: after about a week of practice, we’re now able to bang out. more words per minute at higher accuracy with the Priv’s physical keyboard (265 CPM / 53 WPM). software one (239 CPM / 48 WPM). against BlackBerry’s virtual keyboard, by the way: it’s just as good as ever, with excellent predictive text that lets you swipe directly on the keys to auto-complete. when we need to use the Priv one-handed. The rest of the time we prefer the physical keyboard. (If you’re reading this on your Priv and want to try the typing test yourself, here’s the one. Much of that has to do with the fact that the Priv’s thumbpad is good for much more than typing. Aping one of the most innovative. features of the aforementioned Passport , BlackBerry has used equal parts engineering and magic hackery. the Priv’s keyboard into one big trackpad. That means you can place the cursor exactly where you want it just by moving your thumbs across the buttons. It also means you can scroll lists, webpages, menus and more without ever touching the screen – and considering how tall the Priv is when it’s open, that makes for a much more comfortable user experience.. There’s a third layer of convenience to the Priv’s physical keyboard, and it’s a big part of what made older BlackBerrys so addictive: shortcuts.. You can program any of the Priv’s keys to open any app with a single click, and each supports either a short or a long press, for a total of 52 possible shortcuts. A short-press of the C key might launch the camera, for example, while a long-press might take you to the calculator. Alternately, you can disable the shortcuts in favor of. Device Search, which lets you just start typing from the home screen to jump right into a contact, app, or Google search. And within certain apps, you can press T to jump to the top of a page. or B to jump to the bottom – a convenience so addictive we didn’t even need a reviewer’s guide to remind us about it, having remembered it from our days with the BlackBerry Curve .. Until now we’ve mainly focused on the up sides of the Priv experience. Unfortunately, things start getting substantially bumpier when you dive deeper into the software, which is a custom interface built atop Android 5.1.1 Lollipop.. That older foundation means the Priv lacks significant improvements brought by Android Marshmallow like performance upgrades, battery saving measures, and –most crucially for a phone that builds the word “privacy” into its brand name– individual app permissions. BlackBerry has promised a Marshmallow upgrade sometime in 2016 ; until then its DTEK security dashboard. Much of what DTEK offers is generic (like the no-duh suggestion to use. a screen lock) but it does offer some useful information like. which apps are requesting access to. The Priv also comes with device-wide encryption enabled out of the box and a variety of behind-the-scenes security measures. like a hardened Linux kernel and a secure bootchain – though many of these. don’t provide much more security than comparable offerings from, say, Samsung. Most puzzling of all is the lack. of a fingerprint reader; though it’s not the most secure technology in the world, its omission still makes the Priv feel somewhat dated.. The BlackBerry Launcher is peppered with custom enhancements, many carried over from BlackBerry 10. Most prominent of these is the BlackBerry Hub, which aggregates notifications from various sources into a single stream. If you like getting all your alerts in one list this is one of the best ways to do it – in theory. But in practice we found ourselves using the Hub because we. had to, rather than because it actually made our lives easier. For one thing, Android already has a very solid approach to aggregating alerts: it’s called the notification drawer. And though the Hub aspires to be a much more sophisticated total messaging solution, all its added bulk weighs the Priv down. even more sluggish on Android than it was on BB10, with often-used interface elements like the folder menu placed frustratingly. far away in the upper-left corner. And like much of the Priv experience, it’s inconsistent:. tapping on an SMS message in the Hub boots you into the phone’s default messaging app rather than letting you carry on the conversation from within the Hub, and.

There’s also a more useful implementation of Samsung’s edge-screen functionality in the form of the Productivity Tab, which provides quick shortcuts to tasks, email, contacts and calendar when you swipe in from the side of the screen. And almost every corner of the software can be customized with shortcuts and smart actions. The result is an Android phone that’s more customizable out of the box than almost anything out there – as long as you’re willing to deal with the pitfalls that come with.

BlackBerrys have never been known for their imaging prowess –. and on the software side, you could be forgiven for thinking this is the same old BlackBerry. to launch, slow to focus, and slow to save photos; it’s got only the barest of manual controls; it makes a lot of unnecessary noises; and it often reverts to default settings between shooting sessions, which is infuriating. In short: the software needs some work.. The hardware, though, is definitely a step up from the norm. Under the protruding Schneider-Kreuznach lens sits a Sony IMX230 sensor, the same one. the Moto X Pure Edition .. Here, that sensor has been cropped to 18MP and given optical stabilization, and the result is a camera that’s capable of some solid photos with accurate colors and crisp detail in daylight. It can even make waning autumn afternoon light work for it in some cases, with HDR helping out in the shadows (at the expense of saturation, as usual).. Like its counterpart on the Moto X, this camera favors authenticity over bombast, so color sometimes seems a little dead.. That’s especially true in low light, where the diminishing saturation is made worse by a significant. We shot a few photos side-by-side with the Nexus 6P , whose camera did a much better job of preserving color and contrast, especially at night.. Still, the Priv is capable of taking photos that most folks will find more than adequate..

It’ll work for Instagram, but you should. what phone you’re using … and not in a good way.. In camcorder mode (where the Priv’s settings range from 720p/60fps.

It’s not enough to make the video unwatchable, but it’s much more severe than we’ve seen on other phones in this class, and it’s definitely a little distracting even if you’re not looking for it. Fortunately you can shoot all the 4K video you like if you invest in a memory card: the Priv features a MicroSD slot to go along with the 32 gigs of onboard storage.. On the whole, the camera suite here is best described as slightly above average, which for a BlackBerry is great. and we’d like to have seen better low-light and selfie quality, but the Priv will suit most mobile photographers’ needs just fine.. Performance Pros Cons Pricing and Availability. for eight days on T-Mobile US between rural New York and Greater Boston. During that time, we’ve made many more cellular calls than usual, partly due to the fact that. the Priv is just so dang comfortable to talk on. With its display deployed, it’s almost tall enough to feel like an old landline receiver. Neither we nor our callers had any complaints about sound quality over either earpiece or speakerphone, and the dedicated mute key (which at first seemed. superfluous) is one of those features you have to experience to understand just how convenient it can be.. several software updates in the short time we’ve had it,. there remains plenty of room for improvement in fluidity and speed throughout. regularly, and every time the phone boots up it takes several minutes to get itself sorted, during which time the Snapdragon 808 processor seems. Just like on the Moto X, the 808 runs pretty hot on the Priv: the night before this review went to press, our device was charging on AC power while updating apps over WiFi, and within three minutes of starting its first download, it reached 119°F on the back cover. Most phones get plenty hot when updating apps on wall. power, but the Priv seems to run warm all the time..

With an average of 16 hours from wakeup to bedtime, we were able to exceed 4 hours of screen-on time just once in eight. Now, there are plenty of possible explanations for this: we routinely run our phones harder than most folks; this is a Canadian review device not built specifically for T-Mobile; and every time it restarts it flips on a bunch of features like WiFi calling that we then have to. But that’s still a pretty lame showing given the phone’s huge battery. Also lame: the Canadian version lacks wireless charging while the US build includes it.

The BlackBerry Priv is a device I. – and not just for nostalgic reasons. It packs an innovative keyboard and a beautiful display into a unique form factor, and it brings some really thoughtful software improvements that make Android more useful and customizable. Also, its elegant sliding form factor breaks up the never-ending parade of static. slabs we’ve been complaining about for years. Personally, I really like the Priv;. once it gets its Marshmallow update, I may well buy one. But it’s not a $700 smartphone.

Yes, you could make the argument that the Priv is targeted mainly at enterprise. customers with money to spend –. but those are the very customers who are least likely to put up with the performance issues that we’ve seen from the Priv.. What all that boils down to is a two-sided recommendation.

BlackBerry Priv: A Sweet Android Phone with a Slider Keyboard. You young kids today, with your long music and loud hair! You’re too young to remember how people once typed on their phones—by pressing keys on a keyboard!. You may not remember the BlackBerry, either—the original smartphone, the one with a really great keyboard that let you type quickly and accurately.. Back in the day, BlackBerry towered over the business world, owning 40 percent of the smartphone market. But BlackBerry missed the touchscreen boat by an intergalactic distance. The stock crashed, thousands were laid off, the two co-CEOs left, the replacement CEO left. These days, BlackBerry sales are probably around 1 part per million.. Today, there’s a new BlackBerry phone called the BlackBerry Priv—a name derived, apparently, from Privacy and Privilege. This new phone ( $250 with contract from AT&T , or $700 without contract). comes with an operating system no BlackBerry has ever run before: Android.. Related: The Blackphone 2: The Smartphone Built for Spies (and the People They Spy On). It can run, therefore, the hundreds of thousands of Android apps—a welcome change for previous BlackBerry fans who had been stumbling along without the benefit of apps like Netflix and Uber. Android means that that this phone gains the Siri-like wisdom of Google Now. It gets Android’s dictation feature for quick spoken-text entry, which is much better than BlackBerry’s own.. The first Priv runs the Lollipop version of Android; a Marshmallow version is due in January.. But there’s another startling aspect to this phone: It has a concealed, slide-out, physical. keyboard, making it the only major Android phone available today. At nearly 7 ounces, the Priv is heavy—33 percent heavier than, for example, an iPhone 6. And it’s big—big enough to carry a 5.4-inch screen. It’s a little thick, too, although the screen actually curves around the right and left edges like a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+, which helps to disguise the bulk.. (The curved glass doesn’t actually offer any particular features, except for a cool colorful battery “gas gauge” that creeps upward on that edge as the phone charges.). Despite all of that, plenty of people accept the Priv’s size and shape without ever suspecting that a thumb keyboard slides out from behind, with a satisfying, frictionless ssshhhhpp! and rock-solid, wiggle-free stability:. This is not, by the way, the really famous BlackBerry keyboard. It’s smaller and doesn’t have the horizontal guide ridges.. But it’s a pleasure to type on, it never autocorrects your words to something stupid, and it lights up.. It’s also, believe it or not, a trackpad. That is, you can drag your finger lightly across the physical keys to make things move on the screen. That’s how you move the cursor through text. You can also swipe left across the keys to delete what you’ve typed. And you can flick upwards from one of the BlackBerry’s word suggestions to flick it into the text.. The keyboard is also heir to the hundreds of delightful BlackBerry keyboard shortcuts. I love that you can assign any app to any key. You can hold down the C key to open Chrome, the N key for Netflix, the G key for Gmail, or whatever.. Priv for privacy More good stuff Snooze for notifications. You can apply “Do Not Disturb” to individual accounts by time, location, or WiFi hot spot. You might stifle a certain kind of notification only for the duration of a movie, or instruct an email account to sleep until you’re back at your home network. You can easily create icons on your Home screen that, when tapped, call, text, or email certain individuals. You can create an icon that opens an outgoing message to your spouse, or that creates a new email to your boss, or that insta-dials your kid. Once a part of BlackBerry’s own operating system, this feature presents a single list of everything that’s incoming: texts, mail, phone calls, Twitter and Facebook messages, and so on. You can customize it to the hilt. Wake the phone with two screen taps. If your phone starts ringing at a bad time, just turn it face down to shut it up. If you’re holding the phone, it won’t go to sleep. How smart is that? A memory-card slot. Most phone companies have given up giving us expandable storage, but not BlackBerry. Pop a microSD card in here when you need more room for videos or whatever. It blinks at the top right of the phone when any kind of message is waiting for you.

Similar shortcuts await in the email app. You can press the T or B keys to jump to the top or bottom of a folder list. N or P moves you to the next or previous section of something. In email, press C to compose, R to reply, F to forward, and so on. A BlackBerry is still the best way to crunch through email on a phone.. (There’s also an on-screen keyboard, for those occasions when you don’t have room to slide open the physical one—when you’re on the subway at rush hour, I guess. The same swipes and shortcut work there, too.). Should we worry about a moving part on a phone? Something we’ll be slamming open and shut dozens of times a day?. BlackBerry says that in testing, it has opened and closed it over a million times on some of its test phones, and they’re still going strong. If you’re like most people, that should last you at least through the holidays.. BlackBerry is famous as the phone of choice for people who can’t afford to be hacked. And sure enough, signs of fortification are all over the Priv. For example, you can set up Android’s widgets (always-updated info bubbles right on the Home screen) so that they’re not always sitting there, open and visible to people sitting next to you; you can swipe upward to open one.. And there’s an app called DTEK, which steadily monitors the security of your settings and what your apps are doing. It grades the security of your password and other settings. (Tip to BlackBerry engineers, though: On my review unit, DTEK proclaimed my password choice as EXCELLENT. We all know that when you install an Android app, you get this big screen that warns you about which components of your phone the app will want to access. And we all blow right past it. In DTEK, you see a list of your apps, and a list of which phone elements each one has accessed recently. And what about the elephant in the room—Android’s not-so-hot record for security? BlackBerry says that it went to extraordinary lengths to harden up Android to make it BlackBerry secure. Each Priv has its own “cryptographic key at the hardware level,” which can verify that the phone’s software hasn’t been tampered with. The company also says that it had to patch Android’s Linux underpinnings in various ways to “harden” it.. BlackBerry is really, really good at nice day-to-day touches, the little things that will really make an impact on your life with a phone. The back camera (18 megapixels, Schneider-Kreuznach lens) ought to be great. so-so, and it’s also slow-slow; it snaps a couple of seconds after you tap the button.. front, the low-resolution camera can take panoramic selfies, for what that’s worth. The speaker is loud and clear, and the phone sound is fine—as long as you’re on the AT&T network and have a good signal. (BlackBerry indicates that the Priv will come to other carriers in time.). BlackBerry rates the battery at 22 hours of use, but realistically, you’ll get a day out of it, just like any other smartphone.. So yeah, maybe the Priv is BlackBerry’s admission of defeat, or its last gasp. It’s awfully late in the game for BlackBerry to throw a Hail-Mary pass.. But maybe it’s unrealistic to saddle a phone with the fate of its manufacturer. What about assessing just as a phone?. The Priv is a good-looking Android phone with three unusual perks: Much better security than most Android phones, a glorious legacy of clever shortcuts and efficiencies, and a slide-out physical keyboard.. Unlike most phones, which have become increasingly generic, this one has a mission, a point of view, and a particular audience in mind. It may not cause Apple and Google to crumble.

An executive at carrier partner AT&T admits the Priv phone is "really struggling" and suffers a disappointing rate of returns.. June 6, 2016 7:00 AM PDT. Using the Android operating system apparently isn't enough to turn BlackBerry's Priv into a success.. BlackBerry's supporters are starting to waver.. An executive at AT&T, one of BlackBerry's longest allies, didn't pull any punches in an assessment of the latest flagship phone.. "The BlackBerry Priv is really struggling," the high-level executive, who asked not to be named, said last week. "We've seen more returns than we would like.". Wireless carriers are seldom publicly critical of their handset partners, and the sobering comments offer a rare glimpse into the troubles BlackBerry faces with the Priv, which is the first of its phones to run on Google's Android software. BlackBerry, once a global leader in smartphones, hoped the Priv, which features a slide-out physical keyboard, would at least get the company back on its feet in the mobile devices business.. BlackBerry in April reported selling 600,000 phones in its fiscal fourth quarter that ended February 29, well below expectations of 850,000 for the quarter -- and below the 700,000 it sold in the preceding quarter. Still, BlackBerry insisted that the company was still on the path to profitability this year.. BlackBerry CEO John Chen may be inching closer to dumping hardware.. AT&T offered a more detailed account of why the Priv has disappointed. BlackBerry and the carrier expected to see demand for an Android phone with a physical keyboard. Instead, most of the buyers were BlackBerry loyalists, the executive said. Those faithful, however, struggled with the transition from the BlackBerry operating system to the Android operating system, leading to a higher-than-expected rate of return.. BlackBerry's decision to market the phone as a high-end device also hurt its prospects, the executive said. The Priv initially sold unlocked for $699, above the starting price of the iPhone 6S, which sells for $650. Few premium phones have fared well beyond devices from Apple and Samsung.. "There isn't much volume growth in the premium segment, where Apple and Samsung dominate," the executive said.. A spokesman for BlackBerry wasn't available for comment.. The assessment doesn't bode well for the future of BlackBerry's phones. CEO John Chen said in October that the company would exit the phone business , which has been on life support for years, if it cannot turn a profit in 2016.. BlackBerry also has planned to continue with its Android strategy. In January, Chen said he expected one -- and potentially two -- devices this year running on Google's software. The company isn't investing in hardware powered by the BlackBerry operating sytem, though.. The comments are particularly telling given that AT&T has stood by BlackBerry for years. Shortly after Chen took over in 2013, then-AT&T Mobility CEO Ralph de la Vega publicly threw its support behind the company. "We're supporting their efforts to continue being a viable supplier," de la Vega said at the time .. AT&T was the first US carrier to sell the Priv, followed by Verizon and T-Mobile.. Verizon and T-Mobile representatives declined to comment on Priv sales.. This article also appears in Spanish. Read: BlackBerry Priv: 'batallando' por mantenerse a flote en AT&T.

It comes with a new BlackBerry app called DTEK, which reportedly "lets you know when your privacy could be at risk so you can take action to improve it," while at the same time offering access to the Android ecosystem. The Priv has a sliding QWERTY keyboard (a rarity these days), in addition to a 5.4-inch dual-curve Quad HD (1440 x 2560 pixel) display. Other features include LTE connectivity, a six-core Snapdragon 808 processor, 3 GB of RAM, 32 GB of expandable internal memory, and a 3410 mAh battery.

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Optical image stabilization, Autofocus (Phase detection). Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets.

Features: Optical image stabilization, Continuous autofocus, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Hexa-core, 1800 MHz, ARM Cortex-A57 and ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share, SlimPort.

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure.

Jamshed Avari , 12 February 2016. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. ` (Tap to see full size images). We've been following BlackBerry's journey from the top of the smartphone market to the bottom, and it has been extremely tempting on multiple occasions to declare the company effectively dead. Poor decision after poor decision has resulted in the company's products - which were the absolute must-have status symbols of an entire generation - being seen now as relics from the distant past. There are holdouts, no doubt, but their number is diminishing every day.. BlackBerry , the company formerly known as Research in Motion, has had many chances over the past few years to set its course right, but has instead launched one outlandish product after another; trying anything that might work. We liked the unusually shaped Passport ( Review | Pictures ), but it was never going to be a mass-market success. More recently, the Classic ( Review | Pictures ) represented a U-turn in strategy to cater to everyone who hated BB10's touch interface, and the Leap ( Review ) tried to appeal to budget-minded fans but missed that mark spectacularly.. We now have yet another strategy shift, in the form of the BlackBerry Priv. The company has finally caved to pressure and adopted Android, turning its famous business-first ecosystem into a collection of apps and services. 62,990 , this phone has its work cut out for it. Is the Priv finally going to give BlackBerry the success it so badly needs, or is still too little too late?. Look and feel The Priv immediately feels like a super-premium device, but this is more about its build quality than its looks. At first glance, it doesn't have the "wow" factor that, for example, the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge ( Review | Pictures ) has, but that changes the instant you flick the screen up to reveal the keyboard. It's been a really long time since we had anything other than a flat candybar phone to play with, and everything about the mechanism from its sound to its smoothness feels really, viscerally satisfying. It's way too easy to keep absentmindedly flicking the screen up and down when the phone is in your hands, and at no point did we have even the slightest doubt about the durability of BlackBerry's design.. The front is nearly all glass, with curved edges on the sides. The screen itself doesn't curve like the one on the Galaxy S6 Edge; the space to the sides is mostly the screen border. This means there's no need to strain to read what's at the screen's outer edges, but you'll still have to deal with reflections that are impossible to avoid.. A large BlackBerry logo is placed front and centre above the screen, with a programmable multi-colour notification LED the front camera further to the right. When the screen is off and the phone is plugged in, you'll see a coloured bar indicating the current charge percentage along the screen's right edge. Apart from this, there is no real way in which BlackBerry has integrated the curves into its software or user experience.. Beneath the sliding screen is a lip that lets you push it up with one hand. Unfortunately, we often hit the on-screen Android home button when trying to do this. The bottom of the phone's lower half is thick enough to accommodate the phone's loudspeaker. The power button is on the left and the volume buttons are on the right.. The phone's rear has a carbon fibre finish which is smooth but still easy to grip. There's a thick silver ring around the camera lens, which protrudes quite a bit from the rear. The two-tone LED flash is right next to it. The Nano-SIM and microSD trays are located on the top of the phone's lower half, while the Micro-USB port and 3.5mm socket are on the bottom.. We were concerned about the Priv's size and weight, especially its balance when open. While not ideal, BlackBerry has done well. What surprised us was that this phone is really uncomfortable to talk on - the protective ridge on top dug into our ears and no amount of adjusting made it any better.. Specifications The BlackBerry Priv is a high-end phone with suitably high-end specs, comparable to today's top performers. Unfortunately, it has launched just weeks before the entire Android world will be refreshed, with every top company expected to launch a new flagship at MWC 2016 in late February. The Priv will look a lot like last year's news very soon.. That said, the hardware is still quite strong. There's a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor, with six CPU cores, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage with the option of up to 2TB more using a microSDXC card, LTE support on Indian frequencies, NFC, GPS, and dual-band Wi-Fi ac. The display measures 5.43 inches diagonally and has a resolution of 1440x2560 pixels.. There's a 3410mAh battery with Quick Charge 2.0, but the bundlded charger does not support quick charging. The Micro-USB port on the bottom supports SlimPort accessories such as video output adapters. The camera on the rear has an 18-megapixel sensor, Schneider-Kreuznach optics, a two-tone LED flash, and optical image stabilisation. Video recording goes up to 4K at 30fps. The front camera is only 2 megapixels, so don't expect great-looking shots or video calls from it.. Software and usage Rather than fork Android, which other companies have attempted to do, BlackBerry has gone with the whole Google package, apps and all. The Priv runs Android 5.1.1 though a Marshmallow update should be released by the end of March. There are lots of tweaks and modifications, but surprisingly not a custom skin that might replicate the BB10 experience more faithfully. To the casual user, BlackBerry's involvement in the software of the Priv won't seem any deeper than other manufacturers go, with just a few preloaded apps and cosmetic touches.. That said, there are security-centric features under the hood. BlackBerry knows what its enterprise and corporate customers demand - as we've been told, the name "Priv" comes from "privilege" and "privacy". BlackBerry promises that it has "hardened" Android to protect your data and defend against malware and intrusion attempts. An app called DTEK gives you an overview of your security settings and what your apps have been up to.. The first thing you'll notice on the Android homescreen is the trademark red BlackBerry "splat" badge on app icons, letting you know that you have notifications. While eye-catching, you lose the ability to see how many notifications you have in each app. The badge has also been incorporated into the notifications on the lockscreen and in the pull-down shade: a strip of icons along the top lets you see alerts for each individual app or phone function, and for some reason there is a numerical count next to each one here, even though they're much smaller.. In addition to widgets and app icons, you can have shortcut icons on the homescreens as well. These are very handy, but could confuse some users. These help you perform specific actions, and have descriptive names such as "Check battery level", "Turn Wi-Fi on/off", "Schedule BBM meeting", and "Text contact". This still doesn't quite make up for the relatively sparse selection of quick toggles in the notifications shade.. One very neat feature is that you can call up homescreen widgets related to specific apps by swiping up or down on their icons. This lets you quickly pull up your Chrome favourites or VLC's playback controls, see messages between you and a particular contact, or even check the contents of your Google Drive. It's really convenient and lets you avoid cluttering up your homescreens. The app drawer scrolls vertically, and there are tabs for widgets and shortcuts beyond what you choose to have outside on the homescreens.. There's also a semi-transparent tab on the right, and if you swipe inwards from the edge, you'll be taken to a screen that shows you your upcoming calendar events, unread messages, to-dos, and favourite contacts. You can turn it off if you like, or swap it to the left. It doesn't serve very much purpose since it duplicates a lot of other functionality.. You navigate through the OS just as you would any other Android phone. That means BB10's confusing gestures have thankfully been dispensed with, but also that you don't get to quickly dip into the BlackBerry Hub to check activity. The hub still exists, but as an app, not a seamless part of the underlying OS. It's a powerful way to sort through emails and messages, especially if you juggle between multiple accounts and services, and it really does make use of the large screen. However, the floating buttons everywhere are really distracting.. Long-pressing the on-screen Android home button brings up a row of shortcuts to the device-wide search function, Google Now, and the BlackBerry Hub respectively. Unfortunately, it's way too easy to trigger this accidentally, especially when trying to slide the screen up to reveal the keyboard.. It seems as though BlackBerry put a lot of thought into porting its native experience over to Android, and in some ways it feels as though this is what BB10 should always have been like. Frankly, some of the little touches are so nice that we hope Google steals them and bakes them into Android natively. On the other hand, other manufacturers have done more to take advantage of similar hardware, such as allowing split-screen multitasking or floating windowed apps.. The keyboard The Priv's biggest draw is obviously its keyboard, but there is definitely a bit of a disconnect between the device's hardware and software when it comes to actually using it, because BlackBerry has tried to cater to its legacy users as well as new ones who are already familiar with Android. You can also assign shortcuts to each letter and activate them just by long-pressing that key, like on any classic BlackBerry. Shortcuts within the Hub also work as expected.. As far as typing comfort goes, the keyboard is excellent. It isn't as large or spaced out as the legendary Bold series' keyboards, but it has the right contours and you can get used to it in no time. It flexes a little in the centre, but that won't slow you down.. The main problem is the keyboard layout - it has the classic BlackBerry four-line layout with numbers in a block on the left rather than across the top. The Alt key is where you'd expect Shift to be, and Shift is on the bottom row. Enter and Backspace are also in different positions. All this will suit BlackBerry users just fine, but the problem is that this layout is not reflected in the soft keyboard - if you want to just quickly tap something out, you'll have to use the more standard BB10 layout.. The Priv's keyboard also gains the trackpad-like abilities which we first saw and loved on the BlackBerry Passport. You can swipe to the left while typing to backspace entire words, and double-tap to move the text cursor around, which are both wonderful features. You can also swipe down to pull up the on-screen Symbols panel, or swipe up to "fling" autocomplete suggestions into your text.. Speaking of autocomplete, the Priv shows suggestions overlaid on keys when using the soft keyboard (BB10 style) and in a Passport-like bar across the bottom of the screen when using the physical keyboard. This makes other elements on screen jump around when it pops up.. Another thing to consider is that with a standard 16:9 screen, the Priv becomes very, very tall with the keyboard out. BlackBerry has managed to get the balance just right so it isn't top-heavy, but you will have a tough time reaching for buttons and fields on-screen with your thumbs positioned on the keyboard. You can swipe around to scroll, and sometimes use Enter or Backspace to do things, respectively, but there's no cursor and no way to select things and navigate around without constantly shifting your hands around. One-handed use is completely out of the question.. There are definitely people in this world who still refuse to give up their old QWERTY phones, and many more who have had to settle for a touchscreen but would go back given half a chance. The Android world has been sorely lacking physical keyboards for a long time. BlackBerry might have found itself a profitable niche here, but we'd advise anyone interested in this phone primarily for its keyboard to give it a test run at a store before spending a lot of money on it.. Performance and camera The BlackBerry Priv handles itself very well, and we wouldn't have expected anything less considering its pedigree. Day-to-day tasks posed no problem, and we found ourselves much more at ease moving around Android than we ever did with BB10 - though of course BlackBerry loyalists will need time to get used to it. The only problem was that the middle-rear of the phone got hot even when we were doing absolutely mundane things like setting up email accounts.. Benchmark scores were good: we got 60,780 in AnTuTu and 22,271 in Quadrant. 3DMark's Ice Storm Extreme preset was maxed out, and the Unlimited preset gave us 19,288. Similarly, we saw 24fps in GFXbench which reflected the smooth gameplay we were able to get in 3D titles such as Dead Trigger 2. There's more than enough horsepower for all your business and road warrior needs.. However, BlackBerry is also touting the Priv's entertainment capabilities, and in light of that we have to say the screen was great in terms of sharpness, brightness, and colour reproduction. However, reflections on the curved sides made it difficult to enjoy gaming and movies except in darkened rooms. The speaker on the bottom is excellent, pushing loud, rich sound that didn't distort even at high volumes.. The camera app is a bit cluttered, and requires multiple taps to do basic things like switching to video recording. We liked the fact that the slide-out keyboard gave us a good grip when taking photos, and the spacebar acts as a shutter too. You get live filters, a panorama mode, a timer, and an option to crop to 1:1 square photos. Picture quality was good, but not especially impressive considering this phone's status as a flagship. Daytime shots felt a little washed out, and fine details didn't quite make it when examining photos at full size.The front camera is quite awful, but 4K videos taken with the rear camera looked good.. We ran through at least a day and a half with multiple email and messaging accounts active, a bit of gaming and video playback, and plenty of 4G data usage. Our video loop test lasted for 9 hours, 32 minutes before the Priv needed to shut down.. Verdict Will long-time BlackBerry users be happy transitioning to Android, or will they lose what they cherish most? That's the unfortunate question that anyone still clinging to their Bold or Curve will have to answer for themselves. The Priv isn't quite the single-minded business tool that its predecessors have been, and while we understand the tradeoff in favour of versatility, the Priv doesn't do very much that other high-end Android phones don't already do. The massive advantage of native Android apps makes the Priv more attractive than BB10 devices, but not more so than, for example, the Samsung Galaxy S6 which now costs about half as much. In fact, without today's conveniences such as a fingerprint reader and a decent front camera, the Priv actually comes across as a little old-school.. For you to choose to spend Rs. 62,990 on this phone, you'd have to be majorly invested in BlackBerry's keyboard and promise of security, or just really be a fan of the brand. That also means that there's very little to tempt those who are perfectly happy with their iPhone or Android phones. The target audience of die-hard BlackBerry fans who are willing and able to afford this much seems like a minority within a minority, and it might not be enough to pull this company back from the brink.. If BlackBerry had trimmed some features and delivered an Android phone with a keyboard at a lower price point, we'd have been far more enthusiastic, and the company might have found itself some new fans. However, everything launched since the Z10 seems pointlessly overpriced, chasing an audience that might not even exist. All predictions of BlackBerry's demise have thus far not come to pass, but we're not sure how long that can continue at this rate..
