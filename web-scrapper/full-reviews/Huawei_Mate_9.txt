CNET también está disponible en español.. Miss your Note 7? This is the big-screened phone to buy. Huawei Mate 9 (64GB, Space Gray). CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The Huawei Mate 9 has more power than you'll need, a camera that's great for arty shots and a battery that won't quit on you by dinner.. The Bad Its screen is only full HD and its design is utterly forgettable.. The Bottom Line It doesn't have the flame-prone Note 7's beautiful lines and curves, but if you're after a high-performance big-screened phone that won't set your pants on fire, the Mate 9 is a great option.. Full metal jacket 156.9x78.9x7.9 millimetres (6.17x3.1x0.3 inches) 190 grams (6.7 ounces) USB-C charging port 64GB storage MicroSD card slot. A vibrant display that needs more 5.9 inches 1,920x1,080-pixel resolution 373 pixels per inch. A powerful beating heart Octa-core Kirin 960 processor 4GB RAM Android 7.0 Nougat with Huawei Emotion skin Huawei Mate 9 benchmark scores. So you've got to send back your Galaxy Note 7 before it explodes , but you still want a high-performance giant phone in your pocket. Come and check out the Huawei Mate 9.. It's a beefy thing, with a 5.9-inch display that edges out the 5.7 inches of the now-dead Note 7. It's wrapped in an all-metal body, packs two cameras on the back and is stuffed with powerful components.. Apart from the lack of a stylus, the Mate 9 has pretty much everything you'd expect from the Note plus one. And, if you live in the US, it has the Amazon Echo's Alexa voice assistant. That means you'll be able to ask for basics with your voice, like setting an alarm and getting a weather report. And Alexa will be able to control other smart devices, too.. Huawei released the Mate 9 in the U.S. It is now available for $599 in both grey and silver from Best Buy, Amazon, Newegg and B&H. We're checking to see whether (and when) Alexa support might be offered in other countries beyond the U.S.; we'll keep you posted.. Huawei snuck out an even better-sounding version of the Mate 9, called the Mate 9 Pro. With a curved-screen design that looks identical to the Note 7, the Pro packs a meaty 6GB of RAM, up to 256GB of built-in storage and a fingerprint scanner set into a physical home button on the front. It's really the phone that the Mate 9 should be.. Huawei told me that this supercharged variant is only for China, but the product does appear on the UK website, so I can't say for certain that the UK, US and Australia won't see this model at all.. There is also the Mate 9 Porsche Design, which has the same high-end internal specs as the Pro, but has a different aesthetic, thanks to the hands at the Porsche Design house. It's available now in Europe, but it will set you back 1,395 euros (about £1,180, $1,485 or AU$1,980). I'd suggest simply waiting for the Pro, which I imagine will cost about half that.. I've asked Huawei whether the Pro version will hit shelves outside China and will of course update this review with information as we get it.. Squashing in such a big display has made the Mate 9 a big guy to hold. If you've got hands the size of moons then holding it in one hand won't be an issue, but even then, it's tough to stretch your thumb across to type. Bashing out a long email? Use both hands.. The metal body feels sturdy and has none of the flex in the back that you'd find on cheaper handsets. That said, it lacks the luxurious, slick design of the curved glass and metal Note 7. It may be an alternative in specs, but in looks, the Mate 9 is no match for Samsung's phone.. The back of the phone is home to a fingerprint sensor, which works quickly and rarely misreads your prints. It charges through a USB-C connector at the bottom of the phone and there's a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top -- ideal if you're not willing to give up your headphone cable for the iPhone 7 Plus .. The phone comes with a generous 64GB of storage as standard, which you can expand further with a microSD card.. The display's large size helps it show off images and movies well, but I'm disappointed to only see a full HD resolution here. While full HD is sufficient for everyday tools like Twitter, WhatsApp and so on, it doesn't have quite the same clarity as you'll find on higher resolution panels, like the Note 7 with its 2,560x1,440 pixels.. Indeed, the Mate 9 has a pixel density of 373 pixels per inch. The Note 7 packed more pixels into a smaller space, resulting in a much more impressive 515ppi and Google's Pixel XL beats them both with 535 ppi. High resolutions are particularly important if you ever want to use your device with a VR headset like Google's Daydream -- when the screen is right in front of your eyes, you'll really notice the extra pixels.. The Mate 9's screen is at least bright enough to counter the worst of CNET's overhead office lights, and its colours are rich and vibrant. Colourful games like Riptide GP look great. If you don't care a bit about VR then a full HD display like this one will suit you just fine.. The phone runs on Huawei's latest octa-core Kirin 960 processor, which is backed up by 4GB of RAM. It's a potent processor that blitzed through our benchmark tests (see results chart below) and it's helped along by a handful of software tweaks. At the phone's launch, Huawei explained that a whole host of behind-the-scenes software changes help the phone manage its memory and background tasks more efficiently.. How much work Huawei has really done is impossible to say, but regardless I'm happy to report that the phone is indeed buttery smooth to use. It has none of the lag and stuttering when swiping around the Android interface as I've seen on many of Huawei's previous phones. Apps load quickly too, and rarely crash while in use -- something I can't say about the previous Mate 8.. The powerful processor was able to tackle photo editing in Adobe Photoshop Express and Snapseed, Netflix streamed without any problem and demanding games like Riptide GP: Renegade and Asphalt Xtreme had consistently high frame rates for smooth gameplay.. I've not enjoyed Huawei's software in the past as it changes so much of the stock Android interface that it ends up feeling bloated and clunky to use. The changes have been toned down a touch this time round, though. Most notably with the return of the Android app tray. While previous versions removed the app tray, forcing you to keep your apps scattered across the homescreens, the Mate 9 gives you the option of putting it back. It'll help experienced Android users feel more at home.. The software still isn't perfect, though. The settings menu is needlessly complicated and while you can change the themes on the phone, I can't figure out how to download others beyond the pitiful six "local themes" that come preloaded. Huawei's custom skin has been tweaked just enough to make it that bit more pleasant to use overall.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News.

Huawei Mate 9: Big, bold, and still beautiful nine months later. The Chinese company's flagship smartphone is still a great buy, though the competition has vastly increased in the nine months since its debut.. Plenty can happen in nine months. A human baby gestates over the period of nine months, for example, or you can try to grow over four inches of hair. Nine months is also a good time to check in with a smartphone after its initial launch. That's plenty of time for a device to effectively gestate within the general consumer populace.. It's been nearly nine months since the Huawei Mate 9 launched globally. The phablet-sized device was Huawei's great big flagship of last year. It was deemed fast, with its homemade system-on-a-chip, and it offered great battery life and solid camera performance by way of its dual-camera system. But how has it aged since its debut? Let's check in with the Chinese company's enormous smartphone and how it fares against the current crop of competition.. Wide body against the narrow masses. Since the Mate 9's launch, we've seen smartphones effectively shrink in size while still affording plenty of room for the screen. In that sense, the Mate 9 feels like it's already aged eons, and while it may be nearly as slim as its rivals, it's 5.9-inch 1080p display is big in comparison. Unlike the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6 's elongated, narrow candy bar shape, the Mate 9 is like a mini-sized tablet. Though you might appreciate the extra bezel for holding the device and typing two-handed, that's not the direction flagships are headed these days.. The Mate 9 feels like it's already aged eons.. The Mate 9 has other features working in its favor, like a rear fingerprint sensor, which is easy to reach in spite of its larger size. You can customize it to work with a variety of gestures, too, and it's still faster to use than the Galaxy S8's fingerprint sensor.. I like the Mate 9's display, even if it is merely an IPS LCD, compared to the Porsche Design variant's vibrant AMOLED display. I also like its beefy audio capabilities; the phone has a dual-speaker setup so that you can hear its strength even through Snapchat or Instagram Stories. It's excellent for podcasts, though it's still a bit tinny when you playback music at the highest volume. But it broadcasts better than the Pixel.. You might actually appreciate the Mate 9's bezels in this newly bezel-less world.. On the inside, the Mate 9 runs on Huawei's homemade Kirin 960 processor, which you can now also find in the Huawei P10 and Honor 9. At the time of the Mate 9's launch, it was the first mass-market chip to use ARM's new Cortex-A73 design, though now you can find a modified version of it powering the Snapdragon 835. The Kirin 960 is speedy, and with 4GB of RAM, the Mate 9 moves swimmingly through gameplay and processor-intensive apps. I can't believe it's not a Snapdragon, and that's the point, isn't it?. As for the Mate 9's 4000mAh battery — it must be the way that I'm using it because I've had to plug in this phone every other day since I switched back to it. But I will say that I've had some major issues with the Android O developer preview on my Pixel XL, so the Mate 9 has been a surefire Godsend. I can keep the screen on while waiting for my Lyft and watch YouTube TV on the ride home without fear of killing off what little battery I have left. I expected better standby time with the massive pack, but it's vastly better than what the Pixel's been offering me.. Not the Android you're typically used to. You've likely heard us echo it through the Android Central hallways: Huawei's software has long been its Achilles' heel, at least until EMUI 5.0 based on Android 7.0 Nougat showed up. It's what the Mate 9 is running right now, and it looks good, though some of its features won't be available if you decide to employ another launcher, like App Twin .. We've since seen EMUI 5.1 hit the market months after the Mate 9's debut, so it's weird not to have the software update yet. There are plenty of threads pointing to its existence, but nothing is confirmed for the Mate 9.. So what kind of Android are you getting with the Mate 9? You're getting a darker color scheme, default apps like the dialer and messaging app that aren't Google's, and Amazon Alexa (it was added on in a software update earlier this year). You're also getting the option for an application drawer , which wasn't a feature available on Huawei-made phones before, as well as themes and a vastly different notification shade. It's not as clean as the interface you'd find on the Google Pixel or even Samsung's revamped Galaxy interface, but it has features you've used before, like a night mode and multi-window mode. You can also use add-on features like the aforementioned App Twin to clone Facebook and WhatsApp and use two accounts at a time.. Fortunately, Android has this way about it that lets you customize things to your liking. I enjoy using the Mate 9 with the Evie Launcher , for instance, which lets me choose my icon pack. There are other methods you can use to get into the nitty gritty of the interface, too, if you abhor it. But I don't mind the experience of using the phone as long as I've got another launcher to spruce it up.. A great set of rear-facing cameras. Huawei's long been a partner with camera maker Leica, and the German company has once again exerted its influence over the Mate 9's rear-facing cameras. This phone comes equipped with dual 20-megapixel and 12-megapixel cameras. The former focuses on monochrome and the latter hones in on color. Together, they have a symbiotic relationship with the goal of getting you the best shot.. There's little information on what's happening with software updates.. The dual-lens, dual-sensor setup is efficient at capturing the mood, even if does tend to overexpose bright and sunny shots. I loved tinkering around with the wide-aperture mode turned on, and though the Mate 9's primary camera aperture doesn't go as low as the competition, it makes up for it with the aid of optical image stabilization. OIS still isn't a guarantee for most mobile phones.. The Mate 9's dual cameras also help make it capable of bokeh-like "portrait" effects. It's an impressive shooter in well-lit scenic panorama situations, too, though some scenes will look drowned out when it's overcast. You can also choose between three different color modes, including one that helps the colors pop up in an otherwise dull setting. Conversely, it can also overdo the adjustments and contribute to an overly processed photo. Pictures taken at dusk also have a tendency to come out grainy. Still, I love shooting with the Mate 9 , though it's nothing compared to the shots I've managed with the Pixel XL .. Mate 9 is a worthy phone with too much competition. I've received plenty of queries asking about Android-powered smartphones that are under $500. If you're on a network like AT&T or T-Mobile and you're looking for an unlocked, global device that's different than the status quo, the Mate 9 is a great deal. In addition to its giant 4000mAh battery — which, hey, will get you through a day and a half of average use without a charge — it has an impressive dual-camera setup and a beautiful 5.9-inch screen. I like its wider body, too, as it's easier to handle and multitask with than some of the newer, all-glass devices hitting the market.. Perhaps the only caveat to the Mate 9 is that there's little information on what's happening with software updates. We're still wondering: when is EMUI 5.1 making its way over to the device? I should also note that the Mate 9 in my possession is stuck on the Android security patch from April 5, 2017. And I'm not alone , as I discovered in our forums.. Nine months on and there is already a host of smartphones worth the cash over the Huawei Mate 9. With the deals going on right now for Samsung and LG's flagship devices, you may wonder whether it's worth grabbing one of these at its current price of $450. The answer is yes, particularly if you're looking for a wide-bodied, unlocked phone to last you several trips around the earth. But there's no reason to choose this particular device over any other. If you can spare the extra cash, about $150 will net you one of the latest flagships on sale or you can nab a year-old device like the Google Pixel at a much cheaper price. Or if you'd rather stick with the Huawei family, don't forget the Honor 9 is now available at Amazon.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev. 
Esto también se puede leer en español.. Huawei Mate 9 is a dual-camera bruiser. Beyond the 5.9-inch display, the phone packs an octa-core processor, Android Nougat software and a neat dual-camera system.. by November 3, 2016 6:30 AM PDT. Up close with Huawei's massive, meaty Mate 9. The Huawei Mate 9 boasts a big screen and burly specs. Specs and features USB-C charging port Four microphones for active noise cancellation during calls Infrared blaster for controlling TVs 3.5mm headphone jack 4,000mAh battery with fast charging Fingerprint scanner 64GB storage 4GB RAM. If you've just had to send back your Samsung Galaxy Note 7 before it catches fire and you're struggling to decide what to replace it with, Huawei's new Mate 9 phone might be the answer.. It's a beefy phablet, packing a 5.9-inch display into an all-metal body. The display's resolution is only full HD (1,920x1,080 pixels) -- which is a step below the 2,560x1,440-pixel display of the Note 7. That said, there are enough pixels on screen to make text look nice and crisp.. Beyond the display, the phone runs an octa-core Kirin 960 processor, which Huawei claims is "the fastest processor [it has] built." It certainly seemed nippy during my hands-on time with the phone, but we'll be putting it through its paces properly in the full review. Huawei also says it's made a whole bunch of software tweaks to keep it running smoothly over time.. I've not been too keen on Huawei's software before now because it changes so much of the stock Android interface that it ends up feeling quite bloated and sluggish. It's been toned down somewhat this time round, which I'm hoping will make for a more pleasant experience when using the thing. At its core though, it's running the latest version of Android Nougat.. The back of the phone is home to the same dual-camera setup that we've seen already on its P9 phone. While one 12-megapixel sensor takes photos in colour, there's another 20-megapixel sensor which is specifically designed to only shoot in black and white. I was really impressed with the P9's black and white shots -- they were rich, detailed and with a really satisfying contrast. I'm hoping for similar results from the Mate 9.. The Huawei Mate 9 has a lot of exciting tech stuffed inside its metal body, and if Huawei has indeed made its software less bloated then it could well be a great handset to consider if you're after a powerful phablet. It's due to go on sale globally before the end of the year, although prices have yet to be announced.. Huawei has also partnered with Porsche Design for a limited edition version of the Mate 9. As well as Porsche Design branding, the phone will have 256GB of storage, 6GB of RAM and a higher-resolution display. Huawei has yet to confirm where the phone will be available or how many..

The Huawei Mate 9 is an unashamedly big phone, and that’s becoming an increasingly rare thing since the demise of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 .. For the albeit pricey RRP of £600 you get a huge screen, beefy battery, brand-new CPU and plenty of storage and RAM. It’s also now available on contracts from Three in the UK, and sim-free in the US. It’ll be getting an update to add Alexa voice smarts later in the year too.. But while there’s plenty to like here, a few of Huawei’s annoying issues continue to make an appearance.. If you’ve seen a Huawei phone from the past 18-months then the Mate 9 will be familiar. It’s a well-built device, but one that struggles to really excite.. It’s made completely out of metal, with a lovely curved back that helps it feel manageable – despite the fairly hefty 5.9-inch display. It’s certainly large, but it’s no bigger than an iPhone 7 Plus , which has only a 5.5-inch screen. It feels strangely light too, which again helps it feel good in the hand, even for long periods.. Huawei has worked wonders with the ergonomics here, and if I didn’t know the screen was 5.9 inches, I’d have guessed it was much smaller.. The circular fingerprint sensor sits on the rear of the device, just below the camera and as is the case with all Huawei’s phones it’s both supe- fast and accurate. Out of 50 attempts, the scanner correctly unlocked the phone on every occasion. It’s a little small though, which can sometimes make it tough to hit.. WATCH: Huawei Mate 9 video review. While the design is functional, there are easily better-looking phones on the market. I’d have preferred for Huawei to use the blueprint of the Mate 9’s flashier and Porsche-designed sibling. This has slightly curved edges and looks far similar to the Galaxy S7 Edge .. Flanking the USB Type-C port on the bottom are some fairly standard speakers offering decent volume, but almost no detail, and there’s a headphone jack on the top. I’m not overly fussed about this classic connector’s demise, but I’d rather have it present unless there’s a good reason for it not to be there.. The unit sent in for review was of the nicest shade of gold that I’ve ever seen on a phone, but a pink, black and two combinations of silver and white are available too.. In the same way that megapixels don’t make a great camera, having the highest-resolution possible display doesn’t always guarantee a superb screen.. I was a tad disappointed when I first heard the Mate 9 would feature only a 1080p screen, especially when so many cheaper phones are now including quad-HD panels. In reality, however, this is still a gorgeous display – and the lack of the tip-top resolution hasn’t bothered me in the slightest.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

I’ve been using it alongside the Porsche-designed version of the Mate 9 , which has a quad-HD display, and I’ve found that in plenty of situations I’m of the opinion that the 1080p version is actually better.. Colours are bright without being oversaturated, and deeper shades, such as reds, blues and greens, are lovely and rich. Since it’s an AMOLED panel, blacks are inky and it makes for a superb media experience.. Viewing angles are fantastic, as is brightness – although it can’t quite match the Note 7 for sheer nits. Auto-brightness is smooth, something that’s rare, even on the top-end Android phones.. One minor issue that could arise from the resolution is how the phone performs when it’s placed into a Daydream headset, but I’ve yet to test this as right now the support is lacking..

Huawei Mate 9 price and release date Out now in the US, UK and Australia At launch it cost $599.99 (£579, AU$999) Now price in the US has dropped to $499.99, but it's still £579/AU$999 elsewhere Key features The Huawei Mate 9 is Daydream VR-ready We're not certain this will be the best phone for Google's VR platform Designed to speed up over time with Machine Learning Algorithm Design and display Full metal uni-body, but not an exciting design Fingerprint sensor on the back, USB-C port on the bottom Only a Full HD display, when we'd hoped for QHD. Update: Huawei has now released both the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro , which replace the Mate 9 from its top end line up. That means the price of the Mate 9 may drop down soon too.. Original review: Huawei's Mate 9 is a phone that's equal parts Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (minus the fire) and iPhone 7 , mixed in with the brand's own design sensibilities both inside and out.. It's a Note in that it's a large-screened device, which instantly pushes it into the realm of 'power user' and the enterprise space, a claim backed up by the fact that it features the newest, most powerful chipset, also from Huawei.. But it's also aiming for the consumer-friendliness of the iPhone, offering strong cameras, long battery life and increased day to day usability in the long term, something Huawei is keen to talk up.. This is Huawei's big effort to break into the US market, and push itself from being the world's third-biggest phone manufacturer to second place by the end of 2018.. Whether it will succeed is yet to be seen, but this is the phone the company hopes will help dislodge Apple from its runner-up position behind Samsung when it comes to phone sales.. Huawei's Mate 9 launched at $599.99 or £579.99, while in the rest of Europe it cost €699. Those in Australia can also buy the phone for AU$999, but if you shop around you may be able to find a slightly cheaper deal.. Those in the US can now also get the Mate 9 for only $499.99 after it received a permanent price drop but there's no word of a price cut in the UK or Australia.. If you'd rather spend money each month on the Mate 9, we've seen good deals in the UK offering 4GB of data for around £30 a month and an upfront cost of £100.. Huawei has tried to improve every element of the Mate 9 to keep the Mate series relevant in a market that's full of impressive phablet devices.. A key selling point is that this is one of the world's first Daydream-ready phones. That means it'll be ready to work with the Daydream VR platform when Google launches its Daydream View headset at the end of 2016.. The phone is set up with a strong processor to ensure it can run the apps and games it will need to, but we haven't yet been able to test it out with Daydream.. Considering it doesn't feature a 2K display, however, we expect the Huawei Mate 9 won't be as good for VR as, say, the Pixel XL with Daydream or the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge with a Gear VR .. Another big selling point of the Huawei Mate 9 is its durability. If you only upgrade your phone once every few years, you don't want the processing power to drop off after only six months of use.. To that end Huawei has included its own Machine Learning Algorithm in the Mate 9, which is designed to ensure your phone gets faster over time.. It adapts to the way you use your device, and will use this information to prioritise the performance of features you use most often over apps and services you don't use as much.. The Mate 9 has more than 1,000 different functions that can be tweaked, and Huawei says MLA can offer a 20% increase in smoothness of performance, a 50% improvement in system response times and a 20% boost to the graphics read/write speeds.. We haven't been able to try out this feature yet, as we've only had the phone for a week of testing, but Huawei is certainly confident that this phone is only going to improve the longer you own it.. If you’ve used a Huawei Mate 8 , you’ll recognize much of the design language used on the Mate 9. Huawei hasn't seen fit to update it much for the new phone, but it's still a well-built handset.. There's a full metal unibody design, which feels premium in the hand. There are very slightly curved edges on the front and back of the phone, which helps it to sit in the hand better than the Mate 8 did.. It's not as comfortable to hold as some other phablets, such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, but it's better than the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium .. If you’re used to smaller devices the Huawei Mate 9 may not be the best choice for you, as it's a larger phone, and some will find it unwieldy.. It measures 157 x 79 x 7.9mm, making it a very similar size to the iPhone 7 Plus. You get more screen on the Mate 9 compared to the iPhone 7 Plus, though, as the bezels aren't as thick.. There's a fingerprint scanner on the back of the device, underneath the Leica branded dual-lens camera. It's a comfortable location when you're holding the phone in your hand, but if you regularly lay your phone down on a desk you may find it irritating –. you'll need to pick up the phone to unlock it, or press the power button and unlock the phone on screen with your PIN or password.. On the bottom edge are two speaker grilles, either side of a USB-C slot for charging and data transfer.. Some good news, if you were concerned about Huawei following Apple's lead, is that the Mate 9 features a 3.5mm headphone jack. It's on the top edge of the phone on the right hand side, which makes it easy to listen to music when the phone is in a pocket.. The power button – which you probably won't reach for that often if you’re using the fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone – sits on the right-hand edge.. The Huawei Mate 9 isn’t an exciting-looking phone. It looks premium, but it doesn’t have that distinctive look that phones like the more powerful and pricy Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design, or the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, offer.. It’s just more of the same again, although for most people that won’t be an issue.. Huawei notes that the Mate 9 is Daydream VR-ready, but a higher-resolution screen would make for a far better virtual reality experience. Some Huawei watchers were disappointed when it was announced that the Huawei Mate 9 didn't have a QHD panel, and it would certainly have been better if the company had upgraded the screen rather than keeping it Full HD.. The Mate 9 Porsche Design features an incredible QHD screen, which the Mate 9 would have really benefited from. It is unclear why the company didn’t see fit to upgrade it for the 'standard' version of its new phone.. It would have been nice to have a QHD screen for watching video and looking at photos, but it's a particular let-down given the recent launch of Google Daydream and Huawei VR headsets.. Huawei makes a point of noting that the Mate 9 is a Daydream-ready VR headset, but a higher-resolution screen would make for a far better virtual reality experience, and it feels like Huawei has shot itself in the foot by limiting its latest flagship to Full HD.. For general use, though, the 5.9-inch, 1920 x 1080 screen will suit you just fine.. It works out to a relatively meagre 373 pixels per inch, but when viewing general content it looks similar to most other phones you can buy right now.. If you're looking for a higher-quality image when watching video, you might be better off going for a Sony Xperia Z5 Premium with its 4K screen, or even a Google Pixel XL .. The viewing angles with the screen are impressive, though, and it has a real impact when you turn up the brightness on the display.. There's an auto-brightness mode, although most of the time we were using the phone we kept it on full brightness for maximum effect.. Next Page What’s it like to use?.

The Huawei Mate 9 is a high-end Android smartphone , designed and produced by Huawei. It was released on 3 November 2016. The Mate 9 is a phablet with all-metal body. It uses a 5.9-inch display, with Full HD resolution (1920x1080 pixels) and sloping 2.5D shielded glass. [2] [3] [4] The Mate 9 also included FPC1025 fingerprint sensor, which produced by Fingerprint Cards of Sweden. The fingerprint sensor uses a 4-level security system for speed and accuracy. The Mate 9 has an octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 960 chipset, which features an ARM Cortex-A73/A53 Octa-core CPU and Mali G71 Octa-core GPU, which reduces power consumption by 15 percent [ citation needed ]. According to Huawei, the chipset is "the fastest [it has] built." [1] [2] It includes 4,000 mAh high-density battery with Huawei’s SuperCharge technology, which allows 58 percent charge in half-an-hour and a full charge in 90 minutes. The battery provides the Mate 9 with over two days of battery life. It supports GSM , UMTS , LTE-TDD , LTE-FDD networks (support bands vary by models). [6] In some countries, the Dual SIM version is available. [7] [8] The Mate 9 supports Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth and NFC. The dual camera module is powered by Leica. The rear (main) camera is compounded with f/2.2 12- megapixel color camera and one f/2.2 20- megapixel monochrome camera, which lets users take two images together to produce an image with more detail. The monochrome lens can be used separately. It also includes “lossless zoom” and “4-in-1 hybrid focus”, which allows users to zoom in on a subject without worrying about degrading the quality of the photo, and a combination of laser, phase detection, depth, and contrast focus. The Mate 9 also features 4K video, and a front-facing 8MP camera. The Mate 9 comes in Space Gray, Moonlight Silver, Champagne Gold, Mocha Brown, Ceramic White and black (only available in China). It's equipped with 4 GB RAM, 64 GB ROM, and microSD support up to 256GB. [2] [6] It also provides 4GB+32GB and 6GB+128GB versions. [9] There is a mono SIM version with lower camera sensor.. Huawei also released the Porsche Design Limited Edition of Mate 9, which combines Porsche Design’s signature aesthetic with Huawei’s technology. It's equipped with 6 GB RAM, 256 GB ROM and a 5.5-inch curved AMOLED display, with WQHD resolution (2560x1440 pixels) and AMOLED technology. [10] The edition is available in Graphite Black only. The Mate 9 is preloaded with Android 7.0 "Nougat" and Huawei’s Emotion UI (EMUI) 5.0, which improves the system's performance over previous versions. [1] [3] In February 2017, the phone is scheduled to gain Amazon Alexa support in the United States. [11] The Mate 9 is the first phone to feature the optical flow-based video stabilization "Vidhance" from IMINT Image Intelligence AB. The Mate 9 is available in the following first-wave launch markets, include China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Thailand, and United Arab Emirates. The Mate 9 is priced at €699, and the Porsche Design Limited Edition is priced at €1395. The Mate 9 has received generally positive reviews. In Tom's Guide , Sam Rutherford said "Huawei's Mate 9 is the kitchen sink of phones. You get a boatload of features, such as an IR blaster, clever stereo speakers, a fingerprint sensor, and a big, bright, 5.9-inch screen...it would still be the fastest Android phone on the market." [13] while TechAdvisor said, "Huawei’s Mate 9 has the potential to be the best in the Huawei line-up, boasting an impressively large battery alongside powerful internals, an improved dual-camera setup and a sleek, gorgeous design." [3] Shaan Haider on Geeky Stuffs said, " Huawei Mate 9 is a great phone and score brilliantly in every aspect. It comes with a big and beautiful screen, great camera with additional features like dedicated monochrome sensor, top quality fingerprint sensor, feature-rich and productive EMUI along with a moderate battery life."

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: DLNA. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

If you think bigger is better, the Huawei Mate 9 fills the gap for super-big-screen Android phones in the US.. There's a big hole in the Android phone lineup right now, and the Huawei Mate 9 aims to fill it. This 5.9-inch phablet clearly hopes to win over the million lost souls forced to drop their Samsung Galaxy Note 7 , and aims to do so with a big screen, a metal unibody design, and a few intriguing software features. While we don't yet know about pricing or exact availability, we got an early look at the Mate 9 at a briefing in New York.. Availability and Size One thing we do know about the Mate 9's availability is that it will be sold in the United States. While the company is currently the world's third-largest smartphone maker, with a global market share approaching 10 percent, its flagship P series and Mate series phones have been absent from the US for two years now. The company's most successful US phone so far has been the Nexus 6P , produced with Google.. That said, we don't have a launch date or price for the Mate 9. Those will come soon, but not now, a spokesperson from Huawei said. And only the Mate 9, and not any of the other phones introduced at Huawei's event in Munich, will come to the US.. View All 10 Photos in Gallery. So, with that out of the way, what we have here is a big phone, at 3.1 inches wide, with a really nice metal unibody feel. The 5.9-inch screen, however, is surprisingly low-res at 1080p resolution. Before you go off on it, Huawei's previous Mate phones have also had relatively low-res screens, and that helps them optimize battery life on the 4,000mAh cell. According to Huawei, the Mate 9 will last two days on a charge. You don't really notice the screen resolution if you're not sitting right next to a phone with better screen resolution, anyway.. Hardware and Comparisons Inside, there's what promises to be a blazing Kirin 960 processor, 64GB of storage plus a microSD card slot, and 4GB of RAM. The phone runs Android 7.0 Nougat with Huawei's EMUI skin, although the company has pointedly made the skin a little more accessible to US users by making the settings window shade look a lot more like standard Android, and offering an option to restore the traditional Android app drawer. The skin has a few advantages. Most notably, I like the feature that lets you log into two Facebook or WhatsApp accounts at once.. There's an 8-megapixel camera on the front. On the back, you find the fingerprint sensor and dual cameras: a 12-megapixel color one and a 20-megapixel black-and-white one. They work together to create high-quality 12MP images. The cameras record 4K video and have optical image stabilization. On the bottom, there's a USB-C port, and there's a headphone jack on the top. The phone also works as a universal remote control, thanks to its IR blaster.. In the US, the Mate 9 goes up against other large phones like the ZTE Grand X Max 2 , the Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe 5.7 , the LG V20 , and the gigantic, 6.4-inch Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. Huawei is in a tough position here, because it has essentially zero market share and zero brand equity. My top concerns aren't around the phone's quality, but around sales channel and price.. The Mate 9's big, low-resolution screen may appeal to an older crowd — for instance, the folks who subscribe to Consumer Cellular (which also carried the earlier Ascend Mate 2 ). If Huawei can find a good partner and attach a reasonable price to the Mate 9, it may do well with this one. Check back for soon for more details and a full review when the phone becomes available.. Bottom Line: If you think bigger is better, the Huawei Mate 9 fills the gap for super-big-screen Android phones in the US..

Introduction For a certain group of smartphone users, bigger means better, and they're going to want the largest, most feature-packed handsets they can get – while still small enough to fit in their pockets. And though manufacturers have been eager to deliver big- screen phone after big-screen phone, right now that market's in a bit of an upset after the spectacular crashing and burning (pun intended) of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. While the Note 7's early retirement doesn't leave us with an all-out vacuum, it does take away one of the most popular players in the big-screen-phone space. There's still the Galaxy S7 edge , granted, but it's a tricky phone to recommend now, with a follow-up presumably waiting for us in the early months of 2017. So what does that leave us with? The 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus , absolutely, as well as new contenders like the Google Pixel XL , with another 5.5-inch screen. And if you want to go a little bigger still, there's always the 5.7-inch LG V20. Those are all good options, but what if you want a phone with an even bigger display, one that makes you feel like you've got a full theater experience in the palm of your hand, or one large enough to make split-screen multitasking a joy? Huawei may have just the phone for you, with the launch of the 5.9-inch Mate 9. It manages to squeeze in a screen that big without being ridiculously oversized itself, and runs some of the latest silicon to hit the mobile market. Should this one be on your short list of phablets to consider? Let's take a look, but do note that Huawei's Mate 9 is to be available across a number of European and Asian markets only. There has been word that the company might eventually bring it to the US, but we wouldn't hurry to get our hopes up. In the box: Huawei Mate 9 Earbuds Case USB Type-C cable SuperCharge adapter USB Type-C to micro adapter SIM tool Quick-start guide Design Huawei shows us that a big screen doesn't necessarily demand a giant phone The way a phone is built is an important enough issue for smaller handsets, but when we're talking about those on the upper echelon of the phablet bracket, that consideration's all the more critical; how do you give users a big-screen phone experience that's still compact and practical enough to be carried around as a daily driver? With the Mate 9, Huawei answers that challenge with a slim, solidly built metal frame and a screen bordered by some daringly thin side bezels. The handset's a wee bit smaller than last year's Mate 8 , measuring in at 156.9mm tall, 78.9mm wide, and 7.9mm deep. All those measurements are within a millimeter or two of the iPhone 7 Plus (158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm), yet the display on the Mate 9 has a 15% greater surface area. Unlike Apple 's phone, though, Huawei finds space for an analog headphone jack up top. Continuing our way around the handset, we've got an infrared transceiver also on the top edge for controlling your appliances, volume rocker and power button on the right side, speaker grille and USB Type-C jack on the bottom, and the hybrid dual-SIM/microSD tray on the left edge. The body itself has a bit of a curve to it around the edges, though bevels mark the transition to the back and front. The result isn't quite as pleasing to hold as the Pixel XL or iPhone 7 Plus, but it does manage to look quite nice – and maybe more importantly, thin. Dead-center on the phone's back we find its dual main camera, perched above the handset's fingerprint scanner. While there is a slight camera bump there, it's incredibly minor, and doesn't really detract from the Mate 9's lines. Display Big and bright is a winning combination, though the lack of quad HD is curious The Huawei Mate 9 is rocking a 5.9-inch screen, making it among the biggest of the mainstream phablets out there. While that's a step down from the Mate 8's 6-inch display, it's still larger than you're going to find from a lot of Huawei's competition. Its picture looks pretty good, and offers one of the highest-brightness outputs we've seen all year – the iPhone 7 models and the Moto G4s come in at right about the same level, but you won't find much brighter – and that's a big plus for outdoor usability. But while it's big and bright, we still have a couple issues with the Mate 9's screen. Maybe the most significant problem is that it's not particularly high-res, at 1080 x 1920. A full-HD panel like that looks great on a five-incher, and is acceptable on a 5.5-inch model, but as we're brushing up against the six-inch mark, we really start to crave quad HD – and both the smaller LG V20 and Google Pixel XL do indeed offer such a resolution. This situation is made all the more frustrating by knowing that Huawei's giving its special Porsche Design Edition Mate 9 a 1440 x 2560-resolution screen, and that one's only a 5.5-incher. That the standard Mate 9 is both larger and lower-res is disappointing. The Mate 9's screen also suffers from some color accuracy issues, with the sort of over-saturation we normally expect from AMOLED panels. The good news is that EMIU 5.0 allows you to adjust the display's color temperature and tweak its output to your liking. It would just be nicer if it were a little more accurate right out of the box. The phone we tested came fitted with a protective screen cover. While we appreciate the effort to keep the handset looking in tip-top shape, the protector has a bit of a sharp-feeling edge to it that takes away from the Mate 9's otherwise positive tactile layout.. 6.18 x 3.11 x 0.31 inches. 156.9 x 78.9 x 7.9 mm. 6.19 x 3.17 x 0.31 inches. 157.1 x 80.6 x 7.9 mm. 6.23 x 3.07 x 0.29 inches. 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm. 5.94 x 2.86 x 0.3 inches. 150.9 x 72.6 x 7.7 mm.

Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Huawei Mate 9 Compare.

I've seen nothing but praises for this phone on every review I have watched, and for you to give it an 8, shows again how biased this site is towards anything that don't have the Apple logo slapped on it's back. This is easily an 8.7/9 rated phone.. (Posts: 5478; Member since: 10 Feb 2012). posted on 17 Nov 2016, 05:10. "Big and bright is a winning combination, though the lack of quad HD is curious".

I was more interested with the p9 plus even though the mate 9 came out. But when I saw that 12 hr battery life. This phone is now on my wishlist. (Posts: 2617; Member since: 01 Sep 2014). posted on 17 Nov 2016, 06:28. The EMUI should be a con. It's one of the worst Android skins out there.

HTC10, OP3, and lots of other flagship didn't have waterproofing but they didnt write it as cons before... as for camera, let's wait for review from other sites... (since I wont believe any review about camera from a site that say iPhone7 camera is better than S7e, lol). (Posts: 5478; Member since: 10 Feb 2012). posted on 17 Nov 2016, 08:10. Because those you mentioned where released before the iPhone 7, that wasn't a con as of yet in PA's books. Wait till the iPhone get an OLED screen, IPS screens will become a con as well.. (Posts: 6747; Member since: 30 Sep 2014). posted on 18 Nov 2016, 01:24. in response to #18 Hide. and 3.5mm jack should be written as cons from now on....

WOW, iphonearena once again showing its true colors at how bias they are with that comment and scoring this phone only a 8..

I don't get why this phone doesn't have a better Score than 8/10. I mean the Score tells me - if you don't read the review - that the phone costs around 700.-, but is just ok. On the other hand, when I read the full review, there is almost nothing bad. It should score at least as good as the Pixel XL. Maybe the only thing better on the Pixel is the camera. But it also lacks of water-resistance, lacks of a monochrom camera (which btw was already on the P9 very cool), has worse battery and speakers, has around the same performance so...why does it score better? Why?. (Posts: 1256; Member since: 15 Apr 2016). posted on 17 Nov 2016, 09:12. Really impressed with what this phone is offering for the people who desire big phones.

PhoneArena, could you please add Mate 9 to your size compare feature? Porsche Design and Lite versions are already there, but the regular Mate 9 is absent. (Posts: 121; Member since: 22 Mar 2016). posted on 02 Dec 2016, 23:26. The only thing that bothers me in this review is the battery recharge time. 144 minutes? Everyone else is claiming that Mate 9 recharges 60% in just 30 minutes and is completely full after 90 minutes. That's almost and hour less than what you got in your test.... (Posts: 9; Member since: 28 Mar 2016). posted on 04 Dec 2016, 03:48. Its sooo fast 60 % IN 30 MIN YES. (Posts: 307; Member since: 14 Sep 2013). posted on 04 Dec 2016, 12:20.

Huawei’s Mate 9 is an incredible big-screen behemoth that’ll make you forget all about the Note 7.. A giant screen in a modest package. A massive display and humongous battery. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. Although it wasn’t the only big-screen smartphone released in 2016, the Galaxy Note 7. will be the device everyone remembers. Samsung’s next big thing turned out to be a big disaster, and what was almost the Android phone everyone heartily recommend became the Android phone to avoid. It left the crown for best trouser pocket-stretching phone up for grabs, so what phone should people who find a 5.5-inch display just too restrictive buy?. Huawei swooped in to save the day with the Mate 9 , the follow-up to last year’s well-received Mate 8. It has a massive 5.9-inch screen, a strong processor, and a new version of the superb Leica camera we adored on the Huawei P9. Samsung’s misfortune turned out to be Huawei’s opportunity to wow smartphone fans in the U.S.. Here’s a surprise: The Mate 9 isn’t a big smartphone. The screen may be massive, but Huawei has clearly used some form of magic to squeeze it into a small body. It’s shorter and the same width as the LG V20 , which has a 5.7-inch screen, and just 2mm longer and 3mm wider than the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. Probably not coincidentally, it has a nearly identical footprint to the Apple iPhone 7 Plus .. It sits very comfortably in your hand. Yes, you still have to stretch your thumb from one side of the screen to the other, but it’s not an impossible task. It takes no more effort to do so than on “normal” phones like the iPhone 7 Plus or the Pixel XL. The use of on-screen Android menu keys only helps, too. Huawei smoothed the sides of the metal body, but left enough of an edge to give the phone some “bite,” lowering the chances of it slipping from your grip.. While it’s relatively compact and comfortable, it is quite heavy at 190 grams. It’s a big, all-metal phone, with a very large piece of Gorilla Glass over the display, so the extra weight isn’t a shock. This whopping size doesn’t apply to the fingerprint sensor, which is below the camera lens on the rear. It’s actually quite small and is completely obscured by my fingertip. It’s no bad thing, and we can’t fault the accuracy.. What the Mate 9 isn’t is very pretty. The design has barely changed from the Mate 8, which was a bit faceless to start with, and although the dual-lens Leica camera gives it some character; the Mate 9 is all business and not much play.. Huawei has always frustrated us with its software. It covers Android in its own Emotion user interface (EMUI) , which in the past has been intrusive, sometimes buggy, and often awkwardly frustrating. No more so than many other third-party user interfaces, but it usually let the overall phone experience down in a way that seemed unnecessary.. The screen may be massive, but Huawei used some form of magic to squeeze it into a small body.. The Mate 9 still has EMUI, but it’s version 5, and it has been refined. Huawei tells us it’s the company’s biggest software revision to date, with more than 400 alterations, many of which remove older elements we didn’t like. The great news is it’s built over Android 7.0 Nougat, and our review phone has the newest Android security patch installed, so it’s about as up to date as Android phones can get.. Huawei was always a great fan of spreading apps across multiple home screens, Apple-style, rather than giving Android users an app drawer. Rejoice, Android purists, because the Mate 9 has an app drawer. It’s an option hidden in the menu system, but it’s there. Personally, I’ve never had a problem with putting apps on home screens, but having the chance to clear them, highlight key apps, and show off some cool wallpaper is great.. The notification shade now offers a more standard Android experience. Before, EMUI made you swipe about to reach the shortcuts for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other options. On the Mate 9 with EMUI 5, you swipe down to open the shade, then again to reveal all the shortcuts. Just like standard Android on phones like the Pixel and Nexus devices. There’s still a range of pre-installed apps, including Huawei’s own music and video player, game centre, notepad, weather app, calculator, clock, file manager, compass, download manager, and many more. A Booking.com , WPS Office, Todoist, and News Republic app are also onboard, the latter of which insists on sending breaking news alerts as notifications, until I made it stop by uninstalling it. The majority of the pre-installed apps can be removed, so if you can’t stand the sight of them, it’s easy to clear them out.. Huawei included a few notable additional features. App Twin allows you to run two different accounts from a single app. For example, you can run a personal and work version of Facebook or WhatsApp on the same device. Use is limited to supported apps, though. To minimize the negative effects on sleep caused by blue light from the screen, there’s an eye-comfort mode with a scheduler, and there’s a sound recorder that makes great use of the multiple microphones.. Although it’s too early to tell, Huawei has used some clever algorithms to stop Android from slowing down over the length of time you own it. Huawei also uses this machine learning system to monitor how you use the phone, and what apps you frequently use, to try and predict what you do on a regular basis. With these insights, it funnels system resources to those apps and features automatically, in theory making the phone faster in the places you want it. It’s difficult to say if this works, but the phone’s really fast, regardless of how it achieves it.. The changes made to EMUI are interesting. It’s a vast improvement over previous models, and no longer a reason to avoid a Huawei phone, but it’s still different and unique enough so as not to lose its Huawei identity. That’s clever, and shows the effort that has gone into the software. The Mate 9’s EMUI fills a pleasing, usable space in-between stock Android and Huawei’s previous extreme customization techniques. We’d still prefer the Pixel’s clean, standard version of Android, but Huawei has taken a giant leap forward here.. Alongside the Mate 9’s release in the U.S., Huawei also announced a collaboration with Amazon that saw the retailer’s Alexa. voice assistant pre-installed in regions where it’s available. The Mate 9’s Alexa app does everything Alexa can do through the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot , including smart home control, weather reports, news, traffic, alarms, calendar support, and plenty more. It has access to Amazon’s collection of more than 10,000 skills that tap the assistant’s voice recognition capabilities, and support for English, German, and British English dialects.. But while Alexa is a genuinely helpful assistant, don’t expect Siri-like levels of control. Amazon’s assistant doesn’t show visuals like the retailer’s Echo Show speaker, and there’s no hands-free way to interact with Alexa on the Mate 9. (You have to open the app and tap on the bright blue microphone icon before saying a command.). Another annoyance? Personalizing Alexa on the Mate 9 requires installing Amazon’s dedicated Alexa app via the Google Play Store. Without it, you can’t save a home or work address for traffic updates, link your calendar, check your search history, or manage your shopping list, which feels like a step backward.. All that said, we were generally impressed with Alexa’s performance on the Mate 9. It made out most of our commands without a problem, and responded to questions about the weather, local government, and pop culture trivia really quickly. We were a little disappointed to discover that the Alexa app doesn’t prevent the Mate 9’s screen from dimming — when your phone switches off, you have to unlock it if you want to feed Alexa a follow-up command — but Amazon says it’s working on a fix.. Huawei doesn’t use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, or any Qualcomm chip, in its flagship phones. The Mate 9 introduces the Kirin 960 octa-core processor, which is the first to use ARM’s newer A73 design, bringing it right up to date. Regardless of the task, game, or app, the Mate 9 sprinted along, never showing any signs of fatigue.. Put the phone through the usual benchmark tests, and it comes close to Snapdragon 821 devices, such as the OnePlus 3T , depending on the test. It’s worth remembering the Mate 9 has 4GB of RAM, rather than the OnePlus 3T’s 6GB. On AnTuTu, the Mate 9 scores 132,922, which is way below the OnePlus 3T’s average 166,000. Geekbench 4 is more interesting, as it records 5,893, considerably more than the OnePlus 3T’s 4,390. Gaming benchmark app 3D Mark returned a 2,389 score on Slingshot Extreme.. That said, the Mate 9 can’t measure up to the newer Snapdragon 835 in the Galaxy S8. In PCMark, the 835 scores about 10 percent higher than the Kirin 960. And in GFXBench GL, which tests the chips’ graphics performance, it maintains around a 30 percent lead on the Snapdragon 821.. But importantly, the tiny stutters and pauses we’ve seen in older Huawei phones — almost certainly caused by EMUI — are gone on the Mate 9. They were never hugely intrusive, but remove them and the overall experience is cohesive, smoother, more mature, and speeds up work flow in subtle ways. The Mate 9 is a phone primarily aimed at people who wear suits and carry briefcases, and this is important for productivity fiends.. was the first to feature a Leica co-developed dual-lens camera, and it remains an amazing camera phone. The Mate 9 brings the second-generation sensor with it, along with lots of expectations. Early builds of the software didn’t bring out the camera’s best, and we held off reviewing the device before the final version was ready to test.. It changed everything for the better, and we’re extremely pleased to report the Mate 9’s camera is every bit as fantastic as the P9’s. The top lens shoots in color and has 12 megapixels, while the monochrome lens underneath has been boosted to 20 megapixels. There’s optical image stabilisation, phase detection, laser autofocus, 4K video recording, and a f/2.2 aperture.. A headline feature often reported is the inclusion of a 2x optical zoom. This feature actually uses the two lenses together to create a digital zoomed in 12-megapixel picture, without a loss of quality. It does a good job, although zoom in on the already zoomed in picture and there’s a definite loss of quality when you compare it to a standard, non-zoomed version.. The camera can also create pictures with a bokeh effect, where the background is blurred around a single subject, reproducing an effect usually seen on DSLR cameras. It’s becoming more common on smartphones, including Huawei’s own P9, the Honor 8 , the iPhone 7 Plus , and Xiaomi’s Redmi Pro. It’s every bit as fun to use as on the P9, and is more versatile than the iPhone’s Portrait mode, thanks to the ability to alter the focal point after the photo has been taken.. Huawei Mate 9 Compared To. At least, the best ones should. The Mate 9 is more inspiring than a TED Talk given by Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, and Leonardo da Vinci, when each is introduced to the stage by The Rock. It makes you look at things differently. It doesn’t matter if the subject is near or far, in the light or the dark, would look better if captured in black and white, or shot bokeh-style. The Mate 9 will take that picture, and it’ll look brilliant.. Monochrome mode is a real joy. I took a picture of a deserted train station platform that in color was nothing special. Switch to monochrome, and it becomes a minutely detailed, moody shot where one expects to see Harry Lime emerge from the shadows. It’s all so easy to use. A slide-in menu adjusts modes, and there’s a simple touch-and-swipe method of adjusting focus in bokeh shots. There’s plenty for the more serious photographer as well, including a manual mode, and the option to save those shots in RAW format. If you’re messing around with the shutter speed, you’ll need to use a tripod unless blurry shots are your thing.. The Mate 9’s Leica camera is superb, and a very strong reason to buy the phone.. Huawei has repeatedly said 1,920 x 1,080 pixel screens are more than enough for smartphones — except when it’s making phones with other companies. The special edition Porsche Design Mate 9 has a 2,560 x 1,440 pixel resolution, as does the Huawei-made Nexus 6P, for example. Does that put the Mate 9 at a disadvantage? No, not really, unless you start closely examining pixel density — a rather lowly 373 pixels-per-inch here, when phones such as the Galaxy S7 Edge have 534ppi.. The Mate 9’s screen is bright and colorful, with plenty of adjustments to get the look just right. These include the aforementioned blue-light reducing eye comfort mode, plus font size adjustment, color temperature tweaking, and an option for changing the size of images and characters throughout the interface.. Inside the Mate 9 is a 4,000mAh battery, and it’s charged using Huawei’s proprietary SuperCharge system, which means to get the benefits, you need to use the included wall charger and USB Type-C cable. In our tests, the phone lasted two work days without a problem. Power management is excellent, and just doing basic tasks — a few apps, some social networking, and an email or two — barely shifts the battery percentage meter. Benchmark tests and gaming does consume more energy, obviously, but the Mate 9 handles general day-to-day use very well.. Wowing smartphone fans will only happen if they can buy the phone in the first place, and Huawei has always had trouble reaching the U.S., despite considerable success in China, Europe, and increasingly the U.K. But the Mate 9 breaks the mold in that regard. Since January 2017, Huawei has been officially selling the 64GB Mate 9 through Jet.com ,. Amazon , Best Buy , NewEgg , and B&H Photo , now less than $500. It’s available in space grey and moonlight silver.. The Samsung Galaxy S8 , perhaps the Mate 9’s closest current competitor, costs around $625, and we rank the Mate 9 the same. If you’ve only ever read about flagship Huawei phones before, and never tried one out, use the Mate 9. We think you’re going to be impressed.. How about the warranty? Currently, Huawei covers phones for 24-months and batteries and chargers for three months. If the phone has been taken apart, abused, or modified, then it isn’t covered at all. Devices that meet the warranty criteria can be repaired or replaced by an authorised service centre, provided proof of purchase is supplied.. It’s a giant smartphone that doesn’t feel like a big smartphone when you pick it up. We love the camera’s ability to inspire and the sheer processing power, but perhaps most of all, it’s the software alterations that make the Mate 9 the first Huawei phone that’s easy to live with everyday, without any modifications.. If you want a phone with a screen larger than 5.5-inches, the Mate 9 is a great option especially at its now-discounted price. The Galaxy S8 Plus and LG V30 , but they’re both very. There’s also the OnePlus 5, which costs $480 and has a faster processor, but it only has a 5.5-inch screen.. Spigen Rugged Armor Huawei Mate 9 case. The Mate 9 isn’t especially hard-wearing. It doesn’t have a rugged body, and although it isn’t made entirely of glass, will benefit from being kept in a case. Huawei has based EMUI on Android 7.0 Nougat, but it has just kicked off a beta program for the latest Android 8.0 Oreo. Huawei’s dedication to updates has been questionable in the past, but we’re glad to see the Oreo beta already available. Otherwise, the hardware is exceptional, and the phone has the power and performance to be a strong companion for years.. The reason is simple, the Mate 9’s camera is fantastic, the compact body is a joy to hold, and Huawei has listened to complaints about the software and fixed the majority of them. For $500, it’s still a must-buy. You should know, though, that Huawei is about to launch the Mate 9’s successor — the Mate 10. You may want to wait for the launch event coming up soon before you make a decision..

There’s a super simple mode should you want to use it without the complexity of apps all over a home screen. There are lots and lots of customisation options should you want to change the order of the navigation buttons, enable gesture support, themes, the size of items on the screen, the colour temperature etc. A blue light filter is there for saving your eyes at night and helping you sleep. Various utilities such as a floating dock, a shifting keyboard and a mini-screen view are available to help make using the Mate 9 one handed a little easier. The Mate 9 comes with a screen protector pre-installed, but like any other screen protector, it feels nicer to use without one stuck to the screen. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge review: this is the smartphone to beat. Huawei P9 Plus review: high-class phablet held back by sub-par software. Google Pixel XL review: very good phablet but with price tag to match. iPhone 7 Plus review: 2014 called – it wants its phablet back. Huawei’s Mate 9 is a phablet that tries to squeeze a monster screen into a not-quite-so monster body and mostly succeeds.. Given the demise of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 owing to exploding batteries the top-end of the phablet market is open for the first time in years.. Huawei’s Mate series - its big screened but until recently, niche phablet - has been around for a while. The Mate 9 is the latest and greatest, and while it doesn’t look much different from the outside than its predecessor the Mate 8, it’s now more widely available than ever and targeting that vacant spot at the top of the phablet tree.. The Mate 9 doesn’t share much in the way of design likeness to Huawei’s flagship P9. The front is pretty plain: a screen with tiny bezels either side with a top bar containing the earpiece speaker and selfie camera and the bottom bar just containing the Huawei logo.. It’s got one of the highest screen-to-body ratios of any smartphone available, which is good, because the screen really is ginormous at 5.9in. There have been a few devices with larger screens, but not many. For instance, Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus and Google’s Pixel XL have 5.5in screens, while Samsung’s Note series topped out at 5.7in on the diagonal.. The curved aluminium back and chamfered edges make it a lot easier to hold on to the Mate 9 than you might expect. I say easier, because it certainly isn’t as easy to use as a normal, non-monster smartphone such as the Galaxy S7 or Huawei P9.. At 7.9mm thick, the Mate 9 is relatively thin, and even at 78.9mm wide it’s relatively narrow, but one thing it certainly isn’t is light. It weighs 190g, is solidly built and with heft.. There’s no getting over this is a bigger-than-big smartphone. For comparison, the 5.5in iPhone 7 Plus is 7.3mm thick, 77.9mm wide and weighs 188g, while Google’s Pixel XL is 8.5mm thick, 75.7mm wide and 168g.. The 5.9in screen is surprisingly good for a 1080p screen. Most smartphones this size have higher resolution screens so that they have higher pixel densities - the more pixels the sharper the screen.. You can certainly see the difference; the Mate 9’s screen is just not as pin-sharp as the Pixel XL’s screen for instance. But colour reproduction is good, so are the viewing angles and brightness.. The Mate 9 has Huawei’s new top of the line processor the Kirin 960 and 4GB of RAM, which places right up there with the best of the rest of Android devices in raw power.. It’s snappy, particularly in launching apps, which is down in part to Huawei’s new system of intelligent resource management that predicts apps you’re likely to want to use at any given moment.. My usage is obviously predictable because after about two days it was noticeably snappier. Particularly when launching relatively complex apps such as Evernote and games. It actually felt faster than any other Android smartphone I have used to date, which is an achievement.. Huawei promises that its smart systems will keep it that way over the lifespan of the smartphone, but it’s not something we’ll be able to tell for a year or so.. The Mate 9’s battery is equally impressive. Without any power saving modes active I routinely went over 36 hours between charges, dropping only 3% overnight with do not disturb enabled. I used it as my primary device with three hours of app usage and browsing, hundreds of emails and push notifications, a few photos, 30 minutes of mapping, five hours of music over Bluetooth headphones and quite a lot of Dan the Man and Out There Ω during my one hour and 20-minute train commute to and from work.. There are some aggressive power saving modes that promise to stretch the battery life out further. For most the Huawei Mate 9 will last a good two days between charges.. A full charge took just over two hours via the included fast charging USB-C power adapter.. Call quality was excellent, and so was its signal retention: the Mate 9 got a strong, usable 4G signal in places most other smartphone struggle to get any signal, including underground.. Huawei customises Android on its smartphones with a different look and changes to the underlying control and app permissions systems, which it calls Emotion UI (EMUI).. In the past EMUI has been a bit clunky, chintzy and not to my tastes looking a bit like an Android clone of Apple’s iOS. The new EMUI 5, which is based on Android 7 Nougat, is a giant leap in the right direction.. Out the box it doesn’t have an app drawer - every icon must be on the home screen - but it’s a simple option to enable. The colour scheme across the whole interface has been cooled to a much more modern-looking white and blue.. The strange notification panes and other changes that made EMUI worse than most other Android versions have been removed. A series of quick settings are now accessible from the notification shade and even the overview of recently used apps now resembles standard Android.. EMUI 5 still has the tight control over app power consumption, and the reminders that guide users through the identification and killing of apps that are using more than their fair share of power when the screen is off. Some may not like them, but they are useful when used properly at prolonging battery life without having to change you habits.. Some of Huawei’s apps are actually better than standard Android’s counterparts too. The voice recorder app, which is able to use the range of microphones positioned about the phone to identify where a person is speaking from an isolate their audio, is particularly good for recording roundtable meetings.. The app twin feature is also worth using - it allows you to have two instances of apps that only allow one login, such as WhatsApp, Facebook and others. It essentially duplicates the app so you can hot swap between them.. Huawei’s fingerprint scanners are the best in the business for accuracy and speed. The one of the back of the Mate 9 is no exception. Despite being quite small compared to rivals, it worked with a near 100% accuracy. The only time it didn’t recognise my finger instantly was when I was cooking and it was a bit greasy.. The Mate 9 has the second generation of Huawei’s dual camera, which like the P9 is branded as co-engineered with camera maker Leica.. There is one 12-megapixel colour camera with optical image stabilisation and one 20-megapixel monochrome sensor, which is used to collect more light information for the colour camera to improve the amount of detail captured in the shots.. That’s the theory, in practice the whole experience is pretty transparent. If you didn’t know there were two cameras on the back you wouldn’t notice.. Low-light performance is good, but not quite up to the same quality as Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge or the Pixel XL. It’s relatively easy to get good shots in average lighting conditions, and you can produce some detail-rich, beautiful shots in good lighting.. There are various camera modes to choose from, including an easy to use “Pro” or manual mode and some software-based refocusing tricks. But it is the monochrome mode, which just uses the monochrome camera on the back that’s the most fun, capturing sharp, black and white photos better than any colour camera just turned black and white ever could.. The 8-megapixel selfie camera is good - most will like its balance of detail and soft focus for more flattering pictures. It struggled a bit in low-light conditions but no more than most others.. The Mate 9 costs €699 (£595) and is expected to be available by the end of November in a range of five colours in some markets.. For comparison, Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus and Google’s Pixel XL both cost £719 with 32GB of storage, Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge costs around £520, the Huawei P9 Plus costs £500 and the OnePlus 3T costs £399.. The Huawei Mate 9 is a very large smartphone that does a great job of not feeling so in use. The curved back, minimal body to screen ratio and solid build mean it’s easier to hold onto than you might expect.. But with that 5.9in screen, it’s still a massive phone whichever way you look at it, both in use and in your pocket or bag.. After the demise of Samsung’s top-end Note 7 phablet, the Mate 9 is ready to fill the void, as long as a stylus isn’t crucial. So if you want a phone with the big screen, snappy performance and great battery life, a good camera, excellent fingerprint scanner, expandable memory and dual-sim support you can’t go far wrong with the Mate 9.. Pros: expandable storage, dual-sim, great battery life, excellent fingerprint scanner, good camera, massive screen. Cons: big, heavy, screen only 1080p. © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies. 
Everything you need to know about the Huawei Mate 9. Porsche Design's glorious, expensive version of the Mate 9 is up for pre-order, but with a catch. wide range of phones that run from the very big and powerful to the elegant and small. Now Huawei is taking on the phablet market with the Mate 9. It’s the follow-up to last year’s Mate 8, which boasted. a tough act to follow, needless to say, but the Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro. make impressive strides in those areas and others.. available in black, space gray, moonlight silver, champagne gold, mocha brown, and ceramic white. In the past, Huawei hasn’t sold its flagship phones in the U.S., and while the Mate 9 still can’t be purchased through a carrier, it can be bought officially through several online stores.. From Friday, January 6, it is available in the United States as an unlocked phone on Huawei, plus it’s sold for the same price through Amazon , Jet , NewEgg , and B&H Photo .. There’s good news in the U.K. too, where the Mate 9 has been snapped up by the Three network , and sold either with a contract or on Pay As You Go. On the latter the phone is yours for 550 British pounds, plus a fee for the SIM card, or you can choose between a selection of plans. Pay 100 British pounds up front, and you’ll get the phone plus a 1GB data plan with minutes and SMS for 36 British pounds each month, over two years. The network stocks only the 64GB Mate 9 in space grey.. At launch, Huawei said the Mate 9 would also sell in. China, Japan, Germany, Italy, Spain, France, and a few other countries. The price quoted was 700 euros.. If you want the Porsche Design Mate 9, it’s up for pre-order through Porsche Design’s own online store , with shipping expected to start on January 31. Huawei already said the phone would have a limited release, and Porsche Design’s store only ships to the U.K. There are several versions of the Mate 9 available. The standard Mate 9, the Mate 9 Pro only available in China, the Mate 9 Lite, and the limited edition Mate 9 Porsche Design. Here are all the differences, starting with the Mate 9.. If you’re familiar with the Mate 8, the first thing you’ll likely notice about the Mate 9 is just how many design cues it takes from. From the front, the two appear to be cut from the same cloth: they pack. the same earpiece, sensor array, and even logo placement. The dimensions are nearly identical, too. The Mate 9’s aluminum body measures roughly the same. height (156.9mm on the Mate 9 versus. 157.1mm on the Mate 8, width (78.9mm versus 80.6mm), and. depth (7.9mm versus 7.9mm) as the outgoing Mate 8.. The Mate 9 also sports a 5.9-inch Full HD (1,920 × 1,080 pixels) IPS screen with sloping 2.5D shielded glass. the same 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and 8-megapixel front-facing camera. And it has the same 4,000mAh battery, which Huawei said should last about two days with light usage and 20 hours on 4G.. However, when you flip the Mate 9 on its back, you’ll see a big change. Huawei added an upgraded second-generation dual camera module tuned by Leica, following on from the. It’s made of one f/2.2 12-megapixel color camera and one f/2.2 20-megapixel monochrome camera that produces black and white images. The monochrome lens can be used separately, too, to take black and white shots.. The second rear-facing camera doesn’t come at the cost of the first’s quality. It features what Huawei calls “4-in-1 hybrid focus”: a combination of laser, phase detection, depth, and contrast focus, and it’s capable of both wide aperture and bokeh effects, plus up to a 2x optical zoom effect. The two lenses work together to make “bokeh” shots normally only available on expensive DSLR cameras simple.. The Mate 9 sports upgraded internals in the form of Huawei’s new octa-core Kirin 960 processor paired with a Mali-G71 MP8 graphics chip and the company’s proprietary i6 co-processor. It’s a package that altogether performs “180 percent” faster than the 950, Huawei claims,. and as much as 40 percent more efficiently in terms of power consumption.. The Mate 9’s battery sports Huawei’s “Super Safe 5-gate protection,” a power design which delivers real-time voltage, current, and temperature monitoring to “eliminate safety hazards” and “safeguard battery life.” And it supports. The company said it’ll juice up 50 percent faster than the Mate 8, and reach as much as 58 percent capacity — enough for a day’s use — in 30 minutes. The Mate 9 also packs a USB Type-C connector, Bluetooth 4.2, NFC, dual SIM slot, four noise-canceling microphones, and MicroSD card slot that’s expandable up to 256GB.. In terms of software, the Mate 9 has Android 7.0 Nougat with Huawei’s updated EMUI 5.0 user interface over the top. The software represents the biggest change to EMUI in Huawei’s history, and it’s considerably cleaner, easier to use, and more convenient than ever before. learning algorithms to ensure the phone maintains its speed over time. — specifically by learning which apps you use most frequently and compressing low priority apps. It packs an array of useful tweaks including a miss-dial prevention feature, personalized themes, and privacy tools. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg: EMUI can recognize gestures made with. your knuckles against the screen, which quickly launches apps, can capture screen images, and plenty more.. Alongside the Mate 9, Huawei launched a very special edition of the new phone:. a limited-edition, super stylish collaboration with the well-respected design house Porsche Design. The Mate 9 Porsche Design looks completely different from the regular Mate 9, and comes with upgraded hardware and a. among the “thinnest smartphones in the world,” and it’s certainly a sleek, attractive device. It more closely resembles the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge than the Mate 9, and looks gorgeous in the shiny black color scheme. The screen is smaller at 5.5-inches, and is an AMOLED panel with a higher 2,560 × 1,440 pixel resolution.. The internals are the same as the normal Mate 9, meaning it has the Kirin 960 processor, 6GB of RAM, 256GB of internal memory, and a 4,000mAh battery. It also has the dual-lens camera on the back, but the fingerprint sensor is in a physical home button on the front.. Not that any of this really matters. You’ll want this because of its looks and exclusivity, rather than its technical prowess. How much will you have to pay? It’s. a hefty 1395 euros, or about $1,600. The Porsche Design Mate 9 can be purchased through Porsche Design’s own online store , with shipping to start on January 31. Sadly, the store only delivers its products to the U.K. and various European countries, and no U.S. release is scheduled for the device.. Several weeks after the Mate 9 was revealed, Huawei quietly pushed the Mate 9 Pro onto the market, but only in China. It’s essentially the same phone as the Mate 9 Porsche Design, but without the Porsche Design branding or beautiful black bodywork.. This means it closely resembles the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, with a double-edged curved glass cover over the 5.5-inch, 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution AMOLED screen, and a centrally mounted physical home button with a fingerprint sensor inside, under it. The processor is the same Kirin 960 as in the Mate 9 itself, along with a choice of either 4GB RAM/64GB storage or 6GB/128GB configurations.. The other specifications are also identical to the Mate 9, including the dual-lens Leica-tuned camera, the 4,000mAh battery, and EMUI 5.0 over Android 7.0 Nougat. Interestingly, the Mate 9 Pro is certified for use with Google’s Daydream virtual reality platform. In China, Huawei sells its own Daydream-spec headset for use with the device.. International release plans haven’t been confirmed.. It may be part of the Mate 9 family, but the Mate 9 Lite can’t match the others in terms of technology. The screen is 5.5-inches and has a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution, mounted inside a curved metal body, but the processor is a less powerful 2GHz Kirin 655. A choice of 3GB or 4GB of RAM is available, depending on whether you opt for 32GB or 64GB of internal storage space.. Two camera lenses sit on the back, but they’re not Leica tuned and have a lower megapixel count than the other Mate 9 phones, plus the operating system is Android 6.0 Marshmallow, with the inferior EMUI 4.1 user interface installed. It’ll likely be on sale in China, but international release plans haven’t been stated.. Article originally published in August 2016.

Where to buy the Huawei Mate 9 in the U.S. Where do I buy the Huawei Mate 9 in the U.S.?. Huawei's Mate 9 is big, powerful and, at $599, incredible value. While it may be too big for some, its entry into the U.S. market heralds a turning point for the Chinese company, which is competing extremely well with Samsung and Apple for global smartphone market share.. Unfortunately, Huawei still has roadblocks to overcome before it can sell its phones at U.S. carriers, but in the meantime it has launched the Mate 9 at several well-known and accessible online retailers.. The Huawei Mate 9 is available at Jet.com for $599.99, the standard price for the device. But Jet.com offers a way to save money by opting out of free returns, paying by debit, or both. With both of those options ticked, the phone drops to $584.48, and goes even cheaper if you purchase more than one. Jet.com is our pick for the best place to buy the Mate 9.. Amazon is usually the gold standard for products like this, and the Mate 9 fits right into the retailer's lineup. Available for $599.99 from Amazon in either Moonlight Silver or Space Gray, the phone comes with a U.S. warranty and is eligible for Prime Shipping.. Best Buy offers the Huawei Mate 9 at its standard $599.99 price with free 2-day shipping and a price match guarantee. Pretty standard stuff, but you can get decent financing and some cash-back rewards options with the right credit card, and you know that Best Buy has enough stores to make it easy to return the phone in case of problems.. Newegg is selling the Huawei Mate 9 in both colors, white and silver, for $599.99, and each unit comes with a free Huawei-branded selfie stick, if you're into that sort of thing. Newegg has a great reputation for efficient delivery and easy exchanges, and has a Premier membership program that, like Amazon, offers free shipping and no restocking fee.. The New York-based B&H Photo Video is well-known for stocking hard-to-get products, and Huawei's Mate 9 is available and ready to ship. The company doesn't collect tax outside of New York State, which can help you save a few dollars in the process. Like the other vendors, B&H also stocks both colors of the Mate 9, and offers same-day shipping.. Canadians also benefit from B&H Photo Video, as it is the only one of the retailers listed to ship to Canada — free after $99.. Where to buy the Mate 9 in the U.S. Join the discussion in the forums.

This case turns your iPhone into a modular device. Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ hands-on: The devil is in the details. The Huawei Mate 9 stands out with long battery life and a little AI. You won’t notice the performance-enhancing machine-learning algorithm at work -- and that’s a good thing.. Huawei needs new tricks to differentiate its products from the crowd of Chinese phones permeating the US market, and it's turning to artificial intelligence to set it apart. The Mate 9 is a new Android device that offers a "Machine Learning Algorithm" that purports to learn your habits over time and optimize performance so that the device is more responsive. The Mate 9, which is expected to arrive in the US soon (although the exact timing is unknown), also has one of the largest displays on the market. We don't yet know how much it'll cost in the US, but we expect the Mate 9 to sell for about the same as it does in Europe (€699), which would make it slightly more affordable than other leading big-screen flagships too. That, along with the promised performance boost and supposedly safer battery tech, might be reason enough to consider the Mate 9 as your next large-screen smartphone.. Impressively thin for such a large-screen device. Mediocre camera quality in low light. Polarizing skin will turn off Android purists. Huawei has set itself apart from its competitors by making an actually smart phone that can adjust its performance based on your habits. The Mate 9’s machine-learning algorithm prioritizes resources to apps that it anticipates you’ll use, making your overall experience smoother. But this handset’s most appealing features are actually its stellar battery life and spacious 5.9-inch display. Unfortunately, though, despite the company’s continued collaboration with Leica, the Mate 9’s camera still struggles in low light. That said, if it ends up costing the same as it does in Europe, the Mate 9 will be cheaper than its rivals, making it a good value for its performance.. Huawei has proven in recent years that it is capable of crafting a gorgeous device. The Mate 9 is another example of this though its design is reminiscent of other Android phones such as the ZTE Axon 7 and Huawei's own P9. The all-metal unibody, rounded corners, sloping back and shiny silver accents give it a premium, modern look. My review unit is silver, but gray, gold, white and black are also available.. The Mate 9 has a relatively large 5.9-inch screen, but the phone doesn't feel much bigger than competing devices with 5.5-inch displays. There are no physical keys on the device's front, and you'll have to rely on software buttons to get around the interface.. Gallery: Huawei Mate 9 review | 9 Photos. On the Mate 9's back sits a dual-lens camera, with the word Leica faintly printed in between the two sensors. Below that is a slightly indented pinkie-sized fingerprint sensor; the rest of the phone's matte rear has a smooth texture. The phone's left edge houses a dual-SIM tray, and one of the slots is also capable of holding a microSD card. At the bottom is a USB-C port for charging and data transfer, and on the top edge is (you can breathe a sigh of relief here) a 3.5mm headphone jack. Huawei didn't make any drastic changes to its overall aesthetic; this handset looks a lot like its predecessor and the P9 and falls in line with what we've come to expect from the Chinese phone maker.. Now, if you want the Mate 9 in a fancier chassis, you should consider the Porsche Design version, which will be available for €1,395 in Europe later this month, and globally (except the US) in January. Despite having the same guts as the regular Mate 9, this model is slightly smaller, and its curved edges make it feel thinner. The all-black exterior and so-called graphite finish lend it a classy, mysterious air -- like a phone James Bond would use. Other than its better-looking frame, though, the Porsche Design Mate 9 is no different from the regular, save for some included themes and Porsche apps.. Although it's not as pixel dense as others on the market, the Mate 9's 5.9-inch display still manages to deliver crisp, rich images. The screen's colors are actually nicely saturated for an LCD panel, which usually lacks the deep blacks and high contrast of OLED displays. The pink furniture and orange flames in the music video for Britney Spears' Slumber Party , for instance, looked vibrant and bold.. Viewing angles are generous too though darker backgrounds were slightly hard to see when the phone was tilted far away from me. The screen also gets very bright (a scorching 677 nits at maximum intensity), which makes the screen easy to view in most lighting conditions.. If, for some reason, you don't like the display's color temperature, you can tweak it through the settings, dragging a slider to make it as blue or orange as you'd like. I liked the original warmth of the panel, so I didn't find this particular feature very helpful. In addition to the default setting, you can choose what Huawei calls "Eye Comfort," which immediately gives the interface a warm, yellowish cast. This is similar to Night Shift on iOS and is designed to reduce the blue light that can interrupt your body's circadian rhythms.. The phone's bottom-mounted speaker is also loud enough to fill my apartment with sound, but certain songs, including my current earworm ( Oh Lord by Mic Lowry), are lacking in bass. Tracks that are percussion-heavy, like Bruno Mars' 24K Magic , also tend to get slightly tinny at top volume, but you'll rarely need to crank it to the max anyway.. Gallery: Huawei EMUI 5.0 screenshots | 10 Photos. Like other Huawei handsets, the Mate 9 runs the company's own Emotion UI 5.0 over Android ( 7.0 Nougat , to be precise). EMUI has several differences from stock Android, with the most obvious being no apps drawer by default (you'll instead see endless home pages, similar to iOS). However, you can now choose in the settings to use a drawer if that's more your speed. You'll also find more options in the quick settings panel than were there before -- stuff like Huawei Share, Floating Dock and Screen Recording.. Floating Dock is a new feature that, when enabled, places a penny-sized circle on the screen. You can anchor this to the left or right side of the display, and tap it to show the home, back and all apps keys that are also at the bottom of the screen. This makes navigating such a large device easier because you won't have to stretch your finger all the way to the bottom to reach the buttons.. The latest version of EMUI was streamlined to make it easier to get to common settings. Indeed, nowhere is that more evident than in the Settings app. The blue-and-white theme will take some getting used to, but the new search bar at the top makes finding specific tools more convenient. You'll also get the so-called knuckle-sensing features as on previous versions of EMUI, which lets you knock on the display to outline screenshots or start screen recordings.. In place of the typical Android apps like Messages and Photos, you'll find Huawei's own offerings. These are mostly skinned versions of Google's own apps though they give you some additional functionality. For example, the Contacts app has a tool that lets you scan business cards to create new listings. Huawei also threw in some helpful apps like Files, Notepad, Calculator and Phone Manager, the last of which optimizes the Mate 9's performance by closing unnecessary apps and processes. That app also performs virus scans and lets you lock specific apps behind a password or your fingerprint.. Along with these useful tools, Huawei also included a small set of unnecessary apps like Booking.com and News Republic. But as far as bloatware goes, this is a relatively short list -- and everything is stashed away in an unobtrusive folder too.. Ultimately, the biggest difference between EMUI 5.0 and previous iterations of the software is its machine-learning algorithm, and that's not even something you can see. Weirdly, on that note, Huawei also doesn't let you set your own macros, such as preparing to launch Facebook right after you close Messages. It's not clear if this will ever happen, but it'd be a nice tool for power users. Still, the new EMUI offers a host of ways to customize your interface, which should appease people who want a less heavy-handed UI.. Gallery: Huawei Mate 9 camera samples | 31 Photos. An example of wide aperture mode applied with maximum blur. Performance and battery life Huawei Mate 9 Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge HTC 10 AndEBench Pro 15,424 14,941 16,164 13,030 16,673 Vellamo 3.0 7,207 5,343 5,800 4,152 4,876 3DMark IS Unlimited 28,139 28,645 29,360 26,666 26,747 GFXBench 3.0 1080p Manhattan Offscreen (fps) 30 46 48 47 48 CF-Bench 64,154 30,997 39,918 46,290 49,891 The competition Wrap-up. Huawei has once again teamed up with famed camera maker Leica to "co-engineer" its imaging system. Like the Huawei P9 that was unveiled in April, the Mate 9 has a dual-lens system on its rear that's similar to the iPhone 7 Plus. One sensor captures 12-megapixel RGB data while the other records 20-megapixel monochrome information. Together, they're supposed to deliver rich colors and fine details.. I was generally happy with the pictures I took; they were typically sharp though often overexposed. They also generally lacked the vivid colors you'd get from, say, the Galaxy S7 or one of the Google Pixels. Photos taken with the Mate 9 in low light were also grainier than what I got from the other two handsets. As on previous devices, Huawei is offering a Night Shot mode that's supposed to take better images in the dark, thanks to longer exposure. This starts a 10- to 17-second recording session, during which any movement of phone blurs the scene. You'd either have to use a tripod, or sit extremely still for your photos to come out clean.. Still, thanks to a wide aperture mode on the camera, you'll be able to achieve a pleasant depth-of-field effect on your shots. Though the rear lenses have fixed apertures of f/2.2, you can play with the software setting here to make it seem wider than that. The feature is also easy to enable and disable; a tap of the aperture icon on top of the viewfinder turns it on and off. This effect works well on pictures of people or food, but slows down the capture of landscapes as the camera struggles to find a foreground to keep in focus.. The nice thing about Huawei's implementation here compared to Apple and Samsung's is that the Mate 9 lets you decide how much blur you want before you take the shot. You can drag a slider on the screen to choose just how much background you want out of focus. Samsung's All Focus tool only lets you do that after you take the picture, while Apple's tool doesn't let you customize the level of intensity.. Unfortunately, wide aperture mode does not extend to the front camera, where it would have made my selfies pop. Still, the 8-megapixel front camera captured sharp images with mostly accurate colors. Sometimes, when shooting indoors and with Beauty Mode activated, the Mate 9 tended to overexpose, resulting in garishly colored lips and excessive contrast. At its default setting of five on a scale of one to ten, Beauty Mode made people look artificial, with the rest of the image appearing blown out, to boot. Dialing down to level three and below alleviated the problem though.. Overall, the Mate 9's cameras are capable of capturing decent photos that are clear and colorful, and that wide aperture mode is nifty, but they won't impress you like the iPhone 7 Plus or Google Pixel will.. In a sea of phones powered by Qualcomm's mobile processors, the Mate 9 stands out for using Huawei's octa-core Kirin 960 processor. This allows the company to tweak both hardware and software to offer some extra features, like that Machine Learning Algorithm I mentioned, which promises smoother and more responsive performance. In other words, the Mate 9 will learn your behavior over time and optimize performance so it appears faster to you.. Say, for example, you habitually open Instagram right after you close Twitter. The algorithm will remember your behavior and eventually start diverting resources like part of its 4GB of RAM to prepare Instagram the next time you have Twitter open.. During my time testing the Mate 9, the set of actions I performed the most were launching the Gallery app right after closing the camera, as well as checking a battery drain application after looping a video on MX Player. The thing is, I couldn't really tell if the overall smoothness I experienced on the Mate 9 was due to artificial intelligence or simply thanks to a relatively new, speedy processor. It's not as if there's a way for me to A/B test that. Jumping from app to app was a lag-free experience, and I noticed no difference in smoothness whether I was opening programs I had previously used or those that I had never launched. I ran a screen recording app while loading up a game and scrolling up and down repeatedly on Engadget's page on Chrome, and didn't encounter a hiccup.. The Mate 9's performance on synthetic benchmarks puts it in the same league as leading flagships like the Google Pixel and the Galaxy S7. It beat competing phones, including both versions of the Pixel, the Galaxy S7 Edge and the HTC 10 , on the browser-based Vellamo but lost to the Pixel XL and the HTC 10 on AndEBench. The Mate 9 didn't fare as well on graphics-intensive tests, falling behind the two Pixels on 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited. Even then, the gap wasn't huge. The Mate 9 still outperformed the Samsung and HTC devices on that test too.. All of that horsepower is matched by a generous 4,000mAh battery, which Huawei promises will provide 20 hours of continuous video playback. On Engadget's rundown test, which involves looping an HD video with the brightness set to 50 percent, the Mate 9 lasted an impressive 14 hours and 34 minutes. That's 20 minutes longer than the Pixel XL, one hour longer than the Galaxy, and a whopping two hours more than the Pixel.. In the real world, that longevity meant I barely had to recharge the Mate 9 (except after battery tests) during my review period. After I left the phone in my purse for two days without using it, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it still retained 80 percent of its power. On a typical workday, too, during which I received notifications throughout the day, snapped a bunch of pictures and uploaded dozens of images to my Google Drive, it sipped power at a slow rate. At the end of the day, the battery life rating had dipped from 57 percent at the start of the day to 36 percent in the evening.. When it did need recharging, the Mate 9 got back up to 55 percent within an hour of being plugged in, thanks to Huawei's SuperCharge technology. That's fast, considering how large the battery is and how long 55 percent can last. Getting through the first 10 percent was slower, though; it took about 20 minutes to fill up.. In case you were worried that squeezing a big battery into a thin frame could make the phone susceptible to exploding (as was reportedly what happened with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7), Huawei promises its battery is safe. The company says it uses a five-gate protection system that monitors real-time temperature, voltage and current to "eliminate safety hazards and safeguard battery life." Indeed, during my testing, the Mate 9 never got too warm, even during resource-intensive tasks.. It's hard to find comparisons for the Mate 9 when we don't yet know how much it'll cost or when it will launch in the US, but perhaps we'll find out at Huawei's CES press conference early next month. But based on its European pricing (€699 or about $752), it looks like the Huawei phone will go up against the Google Pixel XL ($769 and up) and the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (north of $760 through most carriers).. While both the Pixel XL and the S7 Edge offer ample, 5.5-inch screens, the Mate 9's roomier 5.9-inch panel will appeal to those who need even more real estate to for easier reading, gaming or multitasking. The Mate 9 also has the longest endurance of the lot.. However, both the Pixel and the Galaxy have much better cameras than the Mate 9, while the Pixel in particular runs a cleaner version of Nougat, making it the best choice for Android purists.. Ultimately, what sets the Huawei Mate 9 apart is its large screen and excellent battery life. Although the company has been touting its machine-learning algorithm, it's something that you won't notice or think about unless performance starts to suffer. Either way, the Mate 9 is a perfectly capable device. That said, photography aficionados and stock-Android fans will still prefer the Pixel. Instead, the Mate 9 will mostly appeal to those who want a large canvas to watch videos or play games in a phone that's not too hefty. If the handset's US price is close to what it costs in Europe, it could be a slightly more affordable option than some rivals, making it a good value for the performance it delivers.. android , gadgetry , gadgets , gear , huawei , mate9 , mobile , review , reviews , smartphone , smartphones.

Business Insider Logo Logo for Business Insider over a transparent background. You have successfully emailed the post.. China's biggest phone company made the best smartphone you've never heard of. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn If you live in America, you probably don't know about Huawei. If you do, you were either very into the Nexus 6P , or you watched "60 Minutes" around the time US officials expressed concerns about the firm's potential ties to the Chinese government.. Now, though, it's time to start paying attention. Those security fears have largely died down. The company itself is now the third-biggest smartphone maker in the world, behind only Samsung and Apple, and gaining ground. It's starting its heaviest push yet to compete in the West.. Most importantly, it now has a phone that can actually compete with the iPhones , Galaxys , and Pixels of the world. The Mate 9, as it's called, won't outsell those behemoths, but it is a strong, high-end choice for Android fans, particularly those aching for a big-phone replacement for their Galaxy Note 7. ( RIP .) If you need an especially beefy display and battery, it's near the top of its niche.. At $600, it's anywhere from $50 to $150 easier on the wallet, too. The Mate 9 looks boring, but that doesn't mean it's built cheaply.. On the contrary, its all-metal frame is both smooth and solid. It's also restrained â there are no gaudy logos on the back, and the bezels on its front are thin, letting that big screen sit there without making the phone too huge.. To be clear, though, this is a big fella. The 5.9-inch display here puts the Mate 9 squarely in the "phablet" category. I wouldn't call it "lightweight," either. But for what it is, it's not as chunky as it could've been.. To give a point of comparison, the iPhone 7 Plus, with a display 0.4 inches smaller, is only 2 grams lighter and 0.2 inches thinner. If your hands are on the larger side, it's not impossible to get around on the phone with one hand.. One thing that deserves special praise here is the fingerprint sensor on the back. It's at a natural spot, it's accurate, and it's extremely fast.. The big downside? It's not water-resistant. At this point, that's hard to accept.. The 5.9-inch, 1080p display is solid. It's not as vibrant as the OLED screens of the Galaxy S7 or Google Pixel, or as sharp (not that youâll notice), but it has good contrast, and it can get very bright, which keeps it easy to read outdoors.. If you want to get into the nitty-gritty, though, there are some issues with color accuracy. If you stare closely enough, you'll see that whites assume more of a greenish hue than they do on the iPhone 7 or Galaxy S7. This gets worse when you look at the screen at an angle. Huawei has some color-adjustment settings you can tinker with, but they don't do much.. That said, those are really complaints of hardcore users. Huawei has more or less tried to recreate the look of an OLED screen without actually using OLED tech here. Black tones are good and dark, which makes the whole thing look lively. Most people won't have many issues with it â you can just do better.. The Mate 9 is lightning fast. It scores higher on some benchmark tests than any other Android phone currently on the market.. That's probably going to change once phones using Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 835 start rolling out over the next few weeks, but for now, the Mate 9 and its Huawei-made Kirin 960 chip have zero problems opening apps, installing apps, running multiple apps at once, or flipping through menus. Graphics performance is a plus, too. The Mate 9 doesn't score quite as high in testing there, but newer games like "Deus Ex Go" run without much of an issue. There's nothing here you can't play on high settings.. Still, this is an Android phone that's not made by Google. It's not immune to the occasional bit of stuttering in Chrome. Technically speaking, the Pixel isn't as fast, but it's a bit more bulletproof when it comes to overall smoothness. For phone geeks, the big story here is the visual overhaul of Huawei's software. It'll probably confuse iPhone owners, but it should make immediate sense for those who are familiar with Google's OS.. Huawei is a Chinese company, so past iterations of its EMUI software have reflected what Chinese customers buy â namely, wannabe versions of iOS. With EMUI 5.0, it's gone a long way to appease the West, where people generally prefer Android to look, well, like Android.. The result is something that's cleaner and easier to understand for anyone coming from another Android phone. The design of some Huawei apps more closely resembles those from Google. You can actually stash your apps in an app drawer instead of stuffing them in folders. The "recent apps" button shows your open apps Rolodex-style rather than laying those apps in a horizontal line that's slower to scroll through.. That skin is based on Android 7.0 Nougat, Google's latest major update, and borrows a few of its better features. It still has a few familiar issues, though.. A multiwindow mode lets you run two apps onscreen at once. The "quick settings" menu â the menu you drag down from the top of the screen â is customizable and more neatly laid out. When you're in the full Settings app, there's a handy little slide-out menu that helps you get around faster. These are all minor, but useful, perks.. Beyond that, Huawei adds a few features of its own â some good, some bad, some aimless. Being able to scale down whatever is on the display is nice when you have only one hand free. Dealing with bloatware like Lyft, Booking.com, or NewsRepublic (which takes it upon itself to feed you notifications) is annoying. Being able to access apps through gestures with your knuckles is just weird.. The whole skin is still on the heavier side, but it's fast, it has its perks if you want them, and Huawei has done well to make it more visually consistent. In the coming months, it'll also gain support for Amazon's Alexa assistant â we'll let you know if that's useful once it's live.. The Mate 9's battery life is among the best I've seen â and the No. 1 reason to buy the device.. With no super-high-res display hogging up power, the 4,000 milliampere-hour battery here is more than capable of lasting over a day. When I deliberately tried to conserve, I could get through two workdays before needing a charge. Just know that, as with most phones, gaming for any extended period time will cut all of this down.. Like every other recent Android flagship, the Mate 9 charges over USB-C. It's not the most updated version of the spec, but it does support a fast-charging standard that lets you refill the phone faster.. The only annoyance is that it's a custom standard, so you'll have to use the charger that comes in the box to take advantage of it. It'd be easier if Huawei took after a more widely used standard like Qualcomm's Quick Charge .. The Mate 9's 20-megapixel rear camera isn't class-leading, but it's still above average.. A sample shot with the Huawei Mate 9's camera. It's not exciting, but it's usually accurate. To get the comparison out of the way: No, I wouldn't take this over the shooters on the Pixel (my personal favorite), Galaxy S7, or, to a lesser extent, iPhone 7 Plus. Compared with those, the Mate 9's requires more fine-tuning to get the most out of it, its colors aren't as vivid, and its HDR mode is just about useless. The optical image stabilization isn't the strongest, either, so you have to make sure you have a steady hand. Plus, there's more of a learning curve in the app.. Some of that comes down to personal preference, though. On a technical level, the Mate 9 captures tons of detail, produces very little noise, and is consistently great at getting the right amount of light into a shot. It doesn't go haywire in darker settings, either.. It's all good , and I can't see anyone complaining about it â I just can't see anyone going out of their way for it, either.. As with the iPhone 7 Plus, the Mate 9 also has two lenses on the back. That allows you to, among other things, take shots with a "bokeh" effect, which creates an illusion of depth by keeping your subject in focus while blurring the background. An example of the "bokeh" effect you can create with the dual-camera setup of the Huawei Mate 9. Huawei even goes a step further than Apple by letting you adjust how blurry you want the background to be after you've taken your shot. This isn't essential, but it's a fun trick to have in your bag.. If you don't take it slow and careful, you'll often run into situations where too much of the area surrounding your subject isn't blurred. The Mate 9's biggest problem has more to do with business than the phone itself. Like most phones sold "unlocked," it works only on GSM networks, not CDMA ones. You won't find it in any carrier stores, and you're stuck with AT&T or T-Mobile if you do get your hands on it. if you prefer Verizon or Sprint, you're out of luck.. But if that's not an issue, the Mate 9 is among the best Android phones you can buy. If you specifically want the largest screen possible, it's worth a long look.. Google's Pixel or Pixel XL has a more vivid display, cleaner software that gets first dibs on all updates for the next two years, and a camera that is both excellent and dead simple to use, so that remains the Android phone to get today â especially since we're in a limbo period between the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S8 .. The Mate 9 isn't without its advantages, though. Its battery is better, its design is less wasteful, and, with Alexa on the way, it might play nicer with Echo owners, too.

Flagship phones give manufacturers the opportunity to showcase their latest technology, and because they attract attention and generate buzz, they help raise brand awareness. For Huawei, currently the world’s third largest smartphone producer by market share, its Mate series of phones is the pinnacle of what the company has to offer. And while the Mate 9, the successor to the Mate 8 that we looked at in-depth last year , packs some high-end hardware, Huawei recognizes it takes more than an impressive spec sheet to win the premium smartphone battle; it needs to provide an overall experience and image that matches the phone’s premium price.. Performance and responsiveness are important for any phone, but essential for a flagship like the Mate 9. Making its debut inside the Mate 9’s aluminum chassis is HiSilicon’s new Kirin 960 SoC. The four ARM Cortex-A72 CPUs in the Mate 8’s Kirin 950 have been replaced by four of ARM’s latest Cortex-A73 CPUs. The plus-one change in model number is deceptive, however, because there are some significant differences between the two cores. The A73 actually belongs to a different processor family, with its roots going back to the A17 rather than branching out from the A15/A57/A72 family tree. One of the obvious differences between the two different microarchitectures is a reduction in decoder width: The A72 has a 3-wide decoder while the A73 is 2-wide. Despite what appears to be a reduction in capability on paper, ARM claims the A73 still offers better performance and efficiency relative to A72 on the same process and frequency. Four Cortex-A53 cores complete the big.LITTLE CPU configuration.. The Mate 9’s CPU cores reach higher peak frequencies than those in the Mate 8 too, but the differences are small. The A53 cores get a negligible increase from 1.80GHz to 1.84GHz, while the A73 cores reach up to 2.36GHz versus the 2.3GHz for the Kirin 950’s A72 cores. It’s interesting that Kirin 960’s A73 cores are clocked lower than the Kirin 955’s 2.5GHz A72 cores, especially considering that ARM targets a peak frequency of 2.8GHz on 16nm (the Kirin 960 uses TSMC’s 16FFC FinFET process). With the Kirin 960, HiSilicon is more focused on reducing power consumption (and freeing up thermal headroom for the GPU) instead of chasing maximum CPU performance. Still, based on the A73’s other advantages, particularly the improvements to the memory subsystem, the Kirin 960 should still show a small performance gain relative to Kirin 950/955.. Mate 8 (bottom) and Mate 9 (top). Perhaps the biggest criticism of past Kirin SoCs were their seemingly underpowered GPUs. While Qualcomm pushed the performance and power envelope with its Adreno GPUs, and Samsung added eight- or twelve-core configurations of ARM’s latest Mali GPUs to its Exynos SoCs, HiSilicon’s Kirin SoCs made due with more modest four-core Mali configurations. Peak performance significantly trailed its peers, but Kirin’s lower power consumption limited the effects of thermal throttling (a significant problem for the faster GPUs). Ultimately, performance was “good enough” for the majority of cases.. The Mate 9’s Kirin 960 SoC marks a radical shift in HiSilicon’s GPU philosophy. Not only does it utilize ARM’s latest Mali-G71 GPU based on the all-new Bifrost architecture , but it steps up to an eight-core configuration running at an impressive 900MHz—the same peak frequency used by the Kirin 950/955’s much smaller GPU. The combination of additional cores and architectural improvements give the Mate 9 a significant peak performance advantage over the Mate 8’s Mali-T880MP4 GPU, paving the way for new capabilities such as VR.. The Mate 9 pairs its SoC with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, which is now standard for flagship phones. Internal storage is limited to 64GB, unlike the Mate 8 that offered a choice between 32GB, 64GB, or 128GB of NAND. Both the Mate 9 Pro (128GB) and Mate 9 Porsche Design (256GB) come with additional storage, and all three Mate 9 versions have a slot for a microSD card to expand storage further.. Software features and configuration are also vitally important to performance. The Mate 9, like previous Huawei phones, includes several enhancements to help apps launch faster and keep the system feeling more responsive. Huawei’s EMUI uses the F2FS filesystem and other optimizations to improve storage performance. There’s also Huawei’s “Machine Learning algorithm” that prioritizes system resources (CPU, memory, and storage) to improve responsiveness and overall performance. This feature, which runs locally on the phone, monitors app usage, taking note of which apps are used at what times, and then anticipates the user’s needs, by preloading the predicted app, for example. Android already manages memory usage, evicting background apps to free up resources for active processes, but Huawei takes this further by closing memory-intensive background apps to ensure memory is available for prioritized apps. It also uses compression to increase the amount of data held in working memory.. Before we discuss the Mate 9’s other hardware and features, let’s briefly cover its connectivity options. It supports 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi (2.4GHz and 5GHz), but only a single spatial stream enabling up to a 433Mbps PHY rate on a 80MHz channel. Most flagship phones (HTC 10, LG G5, Motorola Moto Z / Moto Z Force Droid, Samsung Galaxy S7, and iPhone 7 to name just a few) offer dual spatial stream MU-MIMO, so the Mate 9 is a bit behind here. It does come with Bluetooth 4.2 LE, NFC, and even an IR blaster, though.. The Kirin 960 includes a brand new HiSilicon LTE UE Category 12/13 modem that achieves speeds of up to 600 Mbps on the downlink and 150 Mbps on the uplink (2x20MHz carrier aggregation with 64-QAM). This new modem, which drops HiSilicon’s ‘Balong' branding, supports up to 8 data streams on the downlink using a combination of quad carrier aggregation (4x CA) and 4x4 MIMO (only for 2x CA). It also supports up to 256-QAM but not on all 8 streams. This gives it some flexibility in how it achieves its maximum throughput: (2x20MHz CA + 4x4 MIMO at 64-QAM) or (4x20MHz CA + 2x2 MIMO at 64-QAM).. This modem gains another new capability: It now supports CDMA, which is important for carrier compatibility in China, and puts HiSilicon in the same group as Intel, MediaTek, and Qualcomm for global network support. This modem represents a significant investment by HiSilicon, because it uses a completely new, custom design that does not use CEVA LTE IP like previous Balong modems.. There are two different models of the Mate 9. The MHA-L09 model uses a single NanoSIM and does not support CDMA networks. The MHA-L29 model supports Dual SIM Dual Standby (DSDS), although one NanoSIM slot is shared with microSD, so it can use either two NanoSIM cards or one NanoSIM and one microSD card. The second SIM supports 2G/3G operation using GSM (850/900/1800/1900MHz), CDMA (BC0), and WCDMA (1/2/4/5/6/8/19).. Please log in or sign up to comment..

And does top of the charts as I expected!. Crono - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link. I'd love to see the Kirin 960 in a slightly smaller form factor, though, perhaps the next Honor. The biggest flaws of the Honor 8 were the GPU and EMUI 4.1. Most of the other faults were easily forgivable given the reasonable price. The Mate 9's pricing is very competitive given the specs, but I personally find it hard to justify buying anything over $300 anymore. Michael22 - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link. Thanks to the nougat update you now get EMUI 5 for the Honor 8. The GPU is relatively slow in benchmarks, that's correct. But: I didn't manage to find a single game that lags yet. mmrezaie - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link. How is their update track record? are they providing new interfaces and update the android core on their older phones?. Matt Humrick - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link. I discussed this in the software section of our Honor 8 review. Anecdotally, security updates seem to be more frequent recently, but Android updates are still an issue. mmrezaie - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link. MrSpadge - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link. I'd like to see Kirin 960 in a Lumia 960!. p51d007 - Sunday, January 29, 2017 - link. I find it hard to spend such money on "a phone". My first Huawei phone was a 300 dollar Mate2, almost 3 years ago. Not the fastest, not the brightest screen, but that battery life and stability won me over. When the Mate8 came out last year, it had one of those silly high prices. When the Mate9 was about to be released, the price on the 8 dropped to around 400 dollars. A little more than what I originally wanted to pay, but a LOT less than what it was a short 6 months ago. These "flagships" are almost like purchasing a new automobile. The minute you drive it off the lot, it loses a ton of value, but, if you want til the end of the model year, you can pick up a good bargain, and, at the end of a production run, the LAST of the model in theory, should be better than the FIRST of that model.

Software Huawei also announced it will bring Alexa, Amazon's cloud-based voice service, to the Huawei Mate 9. Customers can ask Alexa to set an alarm, or build to-do lists; get the weather, traffic reports, and more. In addition, Alexa can also control a broad array of smarthome devices. Available in early 2017, access to Amazon Alexa will be pre-installed in an app on Mate 9, providing customers with a natural, convenient user interface to perform tasks and get information. For existing Mate 9 owners at that time, it will be available by over-the-air update. Huawei and Amazon will collaborate to develop rich voice activated consumer experiences for mobile users. Pricing and competition Daily usage experiences and conclusions. A couple of months ago I had the chance to take the. Huawei Mate 9 for a spin and posted my first impressions. Since then, Huawei has issued a few software updates and yesterday revealed that the Mate 9 was making its US debut starting Friday, January 6. It will be available for only $599.99.. The best mobile tech, PCs and laptops on display. Kingston unveils 'world's highest capacity USB flash drive'. Voice is the next computer interface. Dell's killer new XPS 13 2-in-1. HP shows new business convertible and Sprout Pro. Under Armour highlights digital transformation efforts. The Mate 9 brings together the big screen and battery of the Mate 8 and the awesome. dual-lens Leica camera from the P9 to create the absolute best of Huawei in a single device. These hardware features are then powered by the latest Android 7.0 Nougat and EMUI 5.0 so that this single device has everything an enterprise user could want in a single Android smartphone. The Huawei Mate 9 will be sold as a GSM SIM-unlocked phone in the US at Newegg, Amazon, B&H, and Best Buy.. CNET Review : Miss your Note 7? This is the big-screened phone to buy. A billboard at CES also showed that an Amazon Alexa-powered version of the Mate 9 will be launching in 2017. We don't yet have any details on the Alexa integration, but it could be an interesting move for both Huawei (to reach more US customers) and Amazon (to sell more through an established smartphone brand).. The Mate 9 doesn't have a 2K display, but it still looks fantastic and the EMUI 5.0 software provides you with the ability to scale the display density to your preferred level.. The Huawei Mate 9 will be available in space gray and moonlight silver.. Huawei builds gorgeous hardware with dual beveled edges, brushed aluminum shells, 2.5D front glass, minimal bezels, super fast rear fingerprint scanners, and clear displays. The Mate 9 continues the tradition of design excellence and the fit and finish is stunning.. While the 1080p display is not the highest resolution available today, it works well for me in interacting with the device, watching videos, and capturing images. 5.9 inches is a great size for getting work done and spreadsheets look great on the Mate 9 when combined with a Bluetooth keyboard for working on the go.. The Kirin 960 chipset and EMUI 5.0 help the Mate 9 fly and I have yet to see a single slowdown or performance lag. Even with early software over the past couple of months, the device has been stellar and reliable.. It has been a pleasure using devices that I can charge up in the morning and use to my heart's content all day long for 12 or more hours without even glancing for a power cord. I experience this with the iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel XL, and also with the Huawei Mate 9. I take my phone off the charger at 4:45 am and can go until 10:00 pm with these three devices.. When you connect a USB Type-C cable to the Mate 9, you can also choose the reverse charge option to use the massive battery in the Mate 9 to charge up other devices. This is a handy feature to charge up headphones or other accessories.. Huawei Mate 9 first impressions: in pict... 1 - 5 of 20. One thing that doesn't often get mentioned is RF signal strength and with the Huawei Mate 9 I am seeing. connectivity in areas where my iPhone 7 Plus struggles to even make a call. The Mate 9 has been the best performer I have seen since the Galaxy Note 7, thanks to the inclusion of five 2G bands, 10 3G bands and 20 4G bands.. Even though it was likely not a battery failure that caused the problems with the Note 7, Huawei has 5-gate protection on the Mate 9 so you can rest assured you will experience a safe charging experience with the device. To experience the fastest charging on the Mate 9, you need to use the proprietary SuperCharge adapter. Huawei states you can get a full day's usage out of just a 20 minute charge.. The Huawei Mate 9 upgrades the Leica dual-lens experience with integration of optical image stabilization (OIS) in both cameras. The color and monochrome cameras work together to help you capture professional photos with ease. The 4-1 hybrid auto-focus features laser focus, phase detection focus, depth focus, and contrast focus.. In November I captured some photos with the Huawei Mate 9, BlackBerry DTEK60, and Apple iPhone 7 Plus. You can view the originals in this. I then wrote a dual camera comparison article and posted more photos from the Huawei Mate 9, LG V20, Honor 8, and iPhone 7 Plus with the originals contained in this Flickr album. You can judge for yourself, but I find the Mate 9 photos to be the best of all of these phones.. I took the Mate 9 along to New York City for a daddy-daughter Christmas weekend and captured some fantastic shots with the Mate 9. I particularly enjoyed the monochrome photos on the Brooklyn Bridge and wide aperture images. A couple samples are included below:. Monochrome shot on the Brooklyn Bridge. Since so many readers have been concerned about Emotion UI (EMUI) 4.0, I wrote about the improvements in EMUI 5.0 in my first impressions article. You will see improvements in EMUI 5.0, including an app drawer option, enhanced notifications and quick settings, split screen mode, and Huawei's integrated intelligence designed to analyze your behavior and adapt the device for an optimal experience.. While the default Huawei home screen, with app drawer, is a solid offering, as soon as I tested it out for a few days I loaded up the Google Now Launcher. I prefer to have the Google Now cards available to me with a simple swipe to the right and have enjoyed running this for the past month.. Beyond the EMUI 5.0 improvements, I am a huge fan of the Huawei gallery application and image editing tools that help you develop some creative images to share with family and friends. HTC used to have its own custom gallery and editing tools, but switched to Google Photos. Google Photos is fine for backup and photo management, but a custom gallery with high-powered editing tools provides for a much better experience. The color splash option is my personal favorite on the Huawei Mate 9.. Other apps included by Huawei are: a file explorer, flashlight, Huawei Health, Huawei HiCare (service app), Huawei HiGame (game store), Music (media player), Notepad, Smart Controller (IR control app), Themes, Todoist, Weather, and WPS Office.. While I haven't yet been able to test the new Amazon Alexa integration, Huawei stated the following in its press release:. With the Galaxy Note 7 out of contention, the next closest Android competitors to the Huawei Mate 9 are the LG V20 , Google Pixel XL, and Moto Z Force Droid. These are all excellent Android smartphones, but the Mate 9 challenges them with battery life, camera performance, and speed.. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus is also a worthy competitor to the Huawei Mate 9, but I prefer the larger display and smaller bezels of the Mate 9.. I thought we would see the Mate 9 come in at a price close to $800, given what we have seen with UK pricing. The $600 launch price stuns me as that makes it $120 less than the Moto Z Force Droid, $170 less than the LG V20, and a whopping $269 less than the comparable 128GB Apple iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel XL. These both only have integrated storage too while you can further expand the storage capacity of the Huawei Mate 9 for a reasonable price.. A couple years ago Huawei released the Ascend Mate 2 in the US and its long battery life and low price made it a compelling choice. Huawei is finally releasing another big flagship in the US with the Huawei Mate 9 and it is one of the best Android phones available today.. The Huawei Mate 9 is a large phone, but for those of use who spend hours each day on our phones, a large display is an asset. Huawei provides a massive 5.9 inch display in a form factor nearly equal to the 5.5 inch iPhone 7 Plus.. While the iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel provide great camera experiences, the software on both of those devices is basic and appeals to the masses. I haven't had so much fun with a camera as I did with the Huawei P9 and the Mate 9 makes that even better. The Mate 9 camera is my current favorite and I am thoroughly enjoying all of the advanced capture modes.. The Galaxy Note 7 was my favorite Android device prior to the Google Pixel XL, but after spending time with the Huawei Mate 9 it is clear to me it is an exceptional phone for the business user. Priced at just $599.99, it is the best priced flagship available today.. CNET's first look at the Huawei Mate 9:. Kick off your day with ZDNet's daily email newsletter.
