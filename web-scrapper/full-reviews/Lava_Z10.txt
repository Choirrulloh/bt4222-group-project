Aditya Shenoy , 19 April 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Lava Z10 is priced at Rs. Performance is smooth but the cameras do not deliver as promised. It lacks a fingerprint scanner which is now expected in this segment. Lava Z10 design Lava Z10 specifications and software Lava Z10 camera Lava Z10 performance Verdict. Indian brand Lava made news when it teamed up with Google for a low-cost Android One smartphone, the Lava Pixel V1. That effort seems to have ended, and the company was quiet for a long time after that. Now, it's back with a new strategy for the budget segment. Lava recently announced that it will concentrate on a smaller portfolio of devices, starting with the new metal-bodied Z series. The first two models in this series, the Lava Z10 and Lava Z25 ( Review ), claim to offer premium build quality. The Z10 is the more affordable of the pair, and has some decent specs on paper. It is currently priced at Rs 9,900 .. The device goes up against others that are trying to redefine the sub Rs. 10,000 segment, such as the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime. ( Review ) and the Coolpad Note 5 Lite. Does the Lava Z10 have what it takes to stand out? Let's find out.. Lava has taken a very simple approach with the design of the Z10. It has a plain white front and a metallic gold back. What is different is that unlike all the metal unibody phones we've seen in this segment, the back cover is actually a removable shell. It isn't all metal either - Lava has used a metal plate in the middle but the frame is all plastic, including the rim. Once the back cover is off, you see the shiny battery along with two SIM slots (one Micro and one Nano) and a microSD card slot.. The power and volume buttons are on the right, while the left side of the Lava Z10 is completely bare. The positioning of the power button is spot on and it is easy to reach with a thumb. We can't say the same about the volume rocker, which you will need to stretch to reach. There is a 3.5mm headphones socket at the top and a Micro-USB charging port at the bottom of the Lava Z10. The phone's small size makes it comfortable to hold in one hand. The rounded edges on the body prevent it from digging into your palms.. The front of the Lava Z10 has a selfie flash on the top alongside the earpiece. There is a notification LED hidden just below the proximity sensor - it's bright enough to glow from beneath the panel. Instead of capacitive touch buttons below the screen, this phone gets on-screen ones instead.. The main camera is positioned towards the left of the rear, along with its LED flash. A loudspeaker can be seen further down. Lava hasn't given this phone a fingerprint reader, even though that is becoming a standard feature on. You get a plastic case and a screen protector for the phone along with in-ear headphones in the box. The Lava Z10 sports a 5-inch display with a resolution of 720x1280 pixels and 2.5D curved-edge glass. It has good viewing angles and is bright enough to be visible under direct sunlight. The processor is a quad-core MediaTek MT6737 clocked at 1.3GHz. There's also 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage, of which only around 9.4GB can actually be used. Thankfully, there is a dedicated microSD card slot that supports cards of up to 128GB capacity.. The Lava Z10 has an 8-megapixel primary camera with a pixel size of 1.4 microns, and a. At the front, the phone has a 5-megapixel selfie camera with a front-facing flash. The Lava Z10 is a dual-SIM phone and supports 4G and VoLTE on both slots, but only one at a time. The battery is non-removable and is rated at 2620mAh.. Lava's custom Star OS 3.3 runs on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The UI does not have an app drawer and installed apps appear right on the homescreen. You can choose between different themes and effects to customise the look and feel. There are two layouts for the on-screen Android navigation buttons to choose from, offering some flexibility. Strangely, Lava decided to swap the Recents key for an old-fashioned Menu key which makes the phone awkward to use. Google dropped the Menu button's functionality after Android 2.3 Gingerbread and we were surprised to find it on this phone. You'll have to long-press this button to multitask between apps.. The phone comes with quite a lot of preloaded apps including a number of Jio Apps, Hike Messenger, and Gameloft Game Hub. There's also UC browser, Google Chrome, and a stock browser for Star OS which takes the total count of browsers to three. There are also two news apps, Daily Hunt and News Point; and three audio players, Play Music, Music, and Gaana. Most of this bloat can be uninstalled but it would have been better not to have them at all. For those who enjoy FM radio, the phone does have a radio app, which also allows recording.. The Settings app's layout is rearranged. There are tabs for General, Sound, and Display instead of the consolidated list on most Android smartphones. This makes finding the right setting a little harder than it needs to be. The phone has various gestures that can be used when the screen is off. You can double-tap to wake the device or draw an alphabet to launch specific apps.. The Lava Z10 has an 8-megapixel camera with 1.4-micron pixels. A bigger pixel size generally allows the sensor to capture colours better and results in less noise in the output.. The camera app looks heavily inspired by the app on the iPhone, but it is not without its quirks.. Instead of a toggle button for HDR on the main screen, it's buried in the mode selection menu and isn't very convenient to use. Bokeh mode claims to make objects stand out from the background, giving them a nice bokeh effect. The Lava Z10 takes multiple shots and then blurs out the background for the effect. In our experience, the output didn't turn out as promised.. Template mode lets you add predefined stickers with contextual information like place, time, weather, and mood to your photos. Sadly, there is no way to download more templates so you'll have to live with what you get.. The camera on the Z10 tends to overexpose pictures taken in daylight. HDR mode does not help much. Autofocus is a hit or a miss, and as a result, some images lack detail. The Coolpad Note 5 Lite we reviewed recently produced much sharper images. The Lava Z10 does come with a Pro mode to tweak. but we would have liked a more effective Auto mode. Focusing takes a little longer and you have to wait before you can take an image. There is still considerable noise in some photos taken in low light despite the pixel size advantage. The Night Pro mode does help but you have to be patient with it and have a steady hand.. The Lava Z10 has a 5-megapixel selfie camera and a front flash. The app has a wide selfie mode in which the phone actually takes multiple shots and stitches them together. Photos taken indoors with the front camera turned out well. The selfie flash can be used either in auto mode or as a spotlight which stays on all the time. The Z10 is capable of recording video at up to HD resolution (1280x720) with the rear camera while the front camera is limited to VGA resolution (640x480).. Tap to see full-sized Lava Z10 camera samples. The Lava Z10 comes with a considerable amount of bloatware and only has 2GB of RAM. While that seems like a recipe for sluggish performance, the Z10 handles itself quite well. We never had to deal with lag during our review. The Z10 is aggressive with RAM management and we had close to 1GB of RAM free at all times, which is good.. scored 28,959 in Antutu which is on par with similarly priced phones like the Intex Aqua Supreme+. Geekbench's multi-core test returned a score of 1,445, and GFXBench gave us 10fps. We played Real Racing 3, Dead Trigger 2 and Asphalt 8 on the phone, all of which it handled quite well. The Z10 did get warm while playing, but it wasn't uncomfortable to hold.. The battery lasted 11 hours, 11 minutes in our HD video loop test. It managed to keep the phone going for one day with medium usage. There are also battery saving modes that kicks in when the charge level drops below 20 percent. The 5W charger that comes with the phone will make you wait for over two and a half hours if you need to fully top the phone up from zero. Fast charging would have been really helpful.. Lava has managed to make the most of the Z10's hardware in terms of performance. It does not offer anything new for the price it commands. In fact, it misses out on a fingerprint scanner and the cameras do not perform as promised. The Coolpad Note 5 Lite seems like a better option in comparison.. This price segment also has smartphones like the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime. ( Review ) and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. ( Review ), both of which pack quite a punch. If a fingerprint scanner isn't something you must have, the Lyf F1S could be an interesting buy for a much lower price, though it's a device we haven't reviewed so we can't wholeheartedly endorse it. Alternatively, if you can bump your budget up, get the Moto G5. ( Review ) which is significantly more powerful and runs stock Android..

Mobiles / Lava Mobile Phones / Lava Z10 Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 103 Launch Date in India: 23 March, 2017 Compare. Lava has been an underdog when it comes to the Indian handset market, however, it is now trying to change the same with its Z series. The newest handset to join the stables in this series is the Z10, which has been placed in the range of INR 10,000. However, the handset does not seem to have what it takes to contend the competition. Here is a quick look of the device for those who might still be interested in this one.. Bigger 1.4 micrometer pixel: The rear panel of the handset is home to an 8 Megapixels snapper, which is nothing extraordinary.

Moreover, the edges of the device is 2.5D, which makes the handset feel comfortable while holding the handset..

Front Camera: 5MP, LED flash, 1.4um pixel size, f/2.2 aperture. Hits and misses on the camera front. Star OS: like stock Android, minus smoothness. Lava’s Z10 is the company’s latest effort to get into one of the most competitive segment (in and around Rs 10,000) of smartphones in India. The company had previously tried to break into this segment with the Lava Pixel V1 with Android One branding but had met with mixed results at best. Will the Z10 fare better in a market that is extremely competitive?. The Lava Z10 delivers a semi-premium appearance. While it is built using the same metal tech as on Lava Z25, the rear panel is plastic. However, Lava has given the phone the same treatment when it comes to ergonomics and curves. The Z10 comes with a 5-inch HD IPS display with OleoPhobic coating and only 1.9 mm bezel. The display has 2.5D curved glass, which makes the swiping experience awesome. The phone features Series 5 metal Aluminium-Magnesium alloy with a premium chrome lining. The weight of the phone is 148 grams. Just like the Z25, it has a 720P display which is slightly disappointing considering the competition.. The user experience in broad daylight is satisfying as the screen is bright, although the ambient sensor performs poorly. When switching from low light to daylight, it took more than 10 seconds to get the right brightness. The oleophobic coating makes sure that your touch experience isn’t spoiled. I live in a city which has 90 per cent humidity in summer, and you can trust me when I say that the oleophobic coating does work.. We have listed down the specifications right at the end of this section, so let us talk about how the real life experience is. If I have to put in simple words, the performance is not up to the mark. It is usable, but there are hiccups here and there. Many a time, I saw apps reloading when launched from memory.. Based on our experience with Asphalt 8 on high settings, the Z10 is not suited for high-end gaming. It lags, frames drop, and the transition between car crash, in-video, and resuming the game is noticeable. The phone did warm up after a long gameplay session, just like the Z25. But casual games like Candy Crush, Clash of Clans worked well.. The phone carries a 2650mAh battery which is screwed tight to the phone even though the rear panel can be removed. It lasted for sixteen hours on regular usage with music, calls, casual gaming, a couple of pictures, and so on. I spent a good amount of time on calls on the phone. The whole experience was smooth, and in-call audio was smooth. The phone has two SIM slots and a microSD card, which is great for those who want to have two separate SIMs and keep data on an SD card. You get 16 GB of internal storage which is a standard.. The detailed specifications of the Z10 are:. One of the major things that phone misses is the fingerprint sensor, and it’s a BIG miss. Fingerprint sensors have become a standard now, and most of the phones at this price range have them on board. The spec sheet does look good on paper, but the experience was just not up to expectations.. The Lava Z10 houses an 8.0-megapixel f/2.0 aperture rear camera with a single LED flash. It uses 5-layer lens with Bluelight Filter. One should note that Lava is offering the same software experience on Z10 that it had delivered on Z25. The camera software offers features like Bokeh, Night Pro, HDR, Panorama, Wide Selfie, and GIF mode.. The default dynamic range is decent, but low light photography is an issue. Low light photos lose texture details and overall sharpness and are very grainy. In fact, low light performance is bad. The software tries to compensate but it fails mostly, the end result being ‘shaky’ or ‘blurry’ photos. Even low light focusing is mostly a dud. The bokehs too are obviously artificial, with the circular bokeh effect gives it away. The HDR mode is hard on contrast but does a decent job of recovering the highlights.. The front camera in Z10 is of 5 megapixels with LED flash and f/2.2 aperture. Selfies are disappointing in this camera, especially in low light. The photos lose texture details and overall sharpness and are very grainy. Results are better in broad daylight, but not something selfie lovers will appreciate.. Both the front and rear flash of the Z10 support spotlight mode, the flash stays on when taking selfies or normal pictures. However, the camera and software are not able to perform up to the mark, and the front flash does hurt eyes if you take pictures in a row. The rear camera supports 720p recording while the front supports only VGA. The latter is a disappointment for those who would like doing live videos.. The Lava Z10 comes with Star OS version 3.3 on top of Android 6.0. Customization, skins and other UI elements are at a bare minimum. The effect is more like a theme on stock android. The app switching experience, however, is slow. One of the UI implementations I did not like is that of the multitasking button, which opens the menu, and there is no way to change it. Only on a long press on the menu button, you get an option to switch between apps. The Lava Z10 is priced at Rs 11,500 and it is difficult to recommend the phone, especially with the stiff competition at this price range, which includes the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and the Moto G5. Whether sold online or offline, the Z10 is likely to find the going tough, thanks to the missing fingerprint sensor, poor camera performance, and relatively sluggish regular usage. The phone’s running Android 6.0 is also a drawback, given the fact that the new phones are definitely coming with Android 7.0. No, it is not going to be smooth sailing for the Z10..

Lava Z10 - user opinions and reviews. Pages: « 1 2 3 4 ». I am wondering why no one is writing a review regarding sound quality of this phone, really amazing. Battery backup is way far better than I expected. Great device, just blindly grab it guys! Got delivered within a day, seller is awesome.. This is best phone i found in my budget it has lots of unique features and build quality is really appreciated. Now with 8 MP , autofocus, 1.4 µm pixel.
