The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. Some processors have a level 0 cache memory, which is accessed quicker than the L1, L2, L3, and so one cache memories. Besides achieving better performance, it also consumes less power.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors. They increase the performance of the device allowing the execution of multiple instructions in parallel.. The frequency of the processor describes its clock rate in cycles per second. It is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. GPU is a graphical processing unit, which handles computation for 2D/3D graphics applications. In mobile devices GPU is usually utilized by games, UI, video playback, etc. GPU can also perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the CPU..

The best price does not always mean you get the best deal. Take into consideration the warehouse, from which the device will be shipped and consult your local customs regulations, so you will be prepared to pay any customs fees and taxes, if necessary. For example, if you're based in Europe and you order a device from a warehouse in China, it is very likely that the device will be held by the customs in your country and will be cleared once you pay the due taxes. Hence, it might turn out that ordering a device from an EU warehouse might be cheaper. Don't forget to check the delivery and warranty conditions of the online store you want to buy from. Before ordering, check whether the device is in stock and its final price in your local currency. Please, take the quoted rates as tentative due to the fluctuation of exchange rates and the frequent pricing updates by the stores.
