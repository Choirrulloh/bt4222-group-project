CNET también está disponible en español.. High-end smartphone performance for half the price. The Good The OnePlus 2 offers high-end performance at a low price, while not skimping on design. The rear camera delivers pretty good pictures as well.. The Bad The phone lacks both fast and wireless charging and the USB Type-C port doesn't offer any performance benefits. Some software bugs hamper the user experience.. The Bottom Line The OnePlus 2 offers powerful hardware and beautiful design at a comparatively low price, but availability through the OnePlus invite system makes it hard to acquire.. Design and build 5.5-inch display with 1,920x1,080-pixel resolution 5.9 by 2.9 by 0.4 inches (152 by 75 by 9.9mm) 6.2 ounces (175 grams) Four aftermarket cover designs The phone sports metal rims and a raised screen. You can also see the fingerprint sensor just below the screen and the Type-C USB port. The volume and power keys are located on the right side. The OnePlus 2 comes with a range of different back covers. Hardware 1.8GHz octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor from Qualcomm 16GB or 64GB of internal storage (no expandable memory) 3GB or 4GB RAM 3,300mAh embedded battery The phone has a rear 13-megapixel camera with laser assist focus. A closer look at the fingerprint scanner. Operating system Google Android 5.1.1 Lollipop OS Shelf feature that gives you quick access to frequently used apps Customizable themes. Surrounded by plenty of hype, the OnePlus 2 is a smartphone that packs a great camera, a superfast octa-core processor and metal construction in a package that costs way less than what you'd expect to pay for in a typical high-end phone -- but it performs almost just as well.. While the phone's good for its price, there are a few things that it's lacking, such as NFC (near-field communication) for mobile payments and pairing devices, fast charging and even wireless charging -- those have been omitted to keep costs down.. That said, I'm impressed with the design improvements over the original OnePlus One , and while there are a few small stumbles, the 2 still manages to strike the right chords. However, the more expensive construction means the OnePlus 2 comes with a higher price tag than the OnePlus One. Still, at $330 (about £215 or AU$450) for the 16GB version and $390 (roughly £250 or AU$535) for the 64GB model, this handset is a heck of a lot cheaper than most flagships on the market today. (By contrast, the 64GB Samsung Galaxy Note 5 costs about $800 full retail, roughly £500 or AU$1,100.). OnePlus isn't the only company around that's offering phones that are just a step down from premium for a whole lot less -- Xiaomi, Motorola and Alcatel are but a few of the companies that have seen opportunity in this strategy, in the hopes of grabbing market share from big players like Samsung and Apple.. Getting a OnePlus 2, however, will prove to be a challenge. The phone isn't sold through carriers or retail stores -- you'll need an invitation to snag one for yourself. This means waiting for an invite through social media (you can find OnePlus on Facebook , Twitter and Google+ ), or even joining contests in the OnePlus forums. While this does generate even more hype and anticipation, it's not an easy road for interested buyers -- and that's perhaps the biggest disappointment for this superior sequel.. Editors' note: This review was conducted before the 2.0.1 firmware update was available. We'll update this review once we've had a chance to see if that update improves performance and/or battery life.. OnePlus 2 debuts with metal frame and beautiful design (pictures). The OnePlus 2 bucks the trend a little by being slightly smaller than the original phone, while still keeping a similar lineup of features, such as the 5.5-inch full-HD display, protected with Corning's Gorilla Glass 4. Instead of a plastic rim, the OnePlus 2 comes with a metal frame for a premium feel, and has five different rear covers. I spent some time with the sandstone black version and really liked the sandpaper feel. It provides a good grip, so you'll never have to worry about it slipping. If smoother covers are your thing, you'll also be able buy new backplates for about $27 (roughly £20 or AU$40) in rosewood, bamboo, black apricot and Kevlar.. One of the OnePlus One's key design elements was the raised screen, and the 2 keeps this around. While I didn't like it on the original, it's a better fit on the 2 -- I suspect this is due to the higher-quality metal frame and the fact that there's not much wasted space on the top and bottom bezels, as with the predecessor. Instead, the raised screen actually gives the phone some distinct flair you won't find on other handsets.. Just below the display is a fingerprint sensor that you can use to wake the phone. Interestingly, it isn't a button, but more of a shallow depression that you place your finger over. It will turn the phone on even if the screen is off.. Instead of having the SIM card slot along the side like current phones, the OnePlus 2 hides it neatly behind the rear cover. Unfortunately both SIM slots are nano-SIM only, so if your current phone doesn't have one, you'll either have to get a new SIM or trim it down .. The volume keys have also been moved to the right side next to the power button to make way for a new Alert Slider on the left. The slider has three settings -- receive all notifications, receive only priority alerts, or mute notifications entirely. It's a handy and quick way to manage your smartphone usage, though you'll need to manually set which applications can show when you have it turned on for priority alerts. Most of the time though, I skipped the middle setting and went straight to do not disturb or full notifications. I suspect some of the more fastidious users will make better use of this feature, but switching between both full or none seemed to be the more efficient option to me.. Located at the bottom is a USB Type-C port, making this one of the first few smartphones to sport the new port (though I daresay we'll likely see more phones with this feature later this year ). Do, however, note that this is a USB 2.0 port, and not the new-fangled USB 3.0 port. This means transfer speeds will be similar to current phones, and will not be able to hit 5 gigabits per second. That said, it is reversible, so you'll never have to figure out which side up to plug in your phone ever again.. The speakers are located next to it, and while it looks like it has a dual-speaker setup based on the speaker grilles, there's really only one and if you're holding the phone in landscape mode for gaming, your hands will block the sound if you're holding it a certain way -- you'll need to flip it around.. On the back, the 13-megapixel camera has been shifted downward and OnePlus has added laser-assist focus. For the front shooter, OnePlus has chosen to use a 5-megapixel sensor (more on the camera later). Although the back cover comes off, there's no microSD card slot on this phone -- that's bad if you're getting the 16GB version, but fine on the 64GB -- and you can't remove the battery.. OnePlus touts the phone as a flagship killer and on paper, the phone has the chops to do it. The 2 comes packing a 1.8GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, 4GB of RAM on the 64GB storage version and 3GB of RAM on the 16GB model. Both models pack an embedded, unremovable 3,300mAh battery.. While you may have qualms about the 810 processor , which some have said overheats, OnePlus says its OxygenOS has been optimized to work with the hardware, so it won't overheat. I'll be honest, I think it's a nonissue either way, especially based on my experience with Xiaomi's Mi Note Pro , which uses the same processor. The alleged overheating issues of the 810 processor simply didn't seem present for me.. To see if the OnePlus 2 overheated, I took both it and the Xiaomi Mi Note Pro and ran the game Asphalt 8 on them, leaving each phone to continue playing the victory screen for 20 minutes. Then I aimed a temperature gun at the back and sides. Both phones registered a max of around 41 degrees Celsius (105 degrees Fahrenheit). Since the sides of the OnePlus 2 are metal (which I suspect helps conduct away the heat), the phone can be a tad uncomfortable to hold when playing games with it.. I've mentioned the phone's 13-megapixel rear camera -- here are more details. It comes with built-in optical image stabilization, an f/2.0 aperture and laser-assist focus -- that's the area you see below the lens. The sensor's pixels are also larger, OnePlus boasts, for taking better low-light shots and we'll find out if this is true in my camera analysis below.. What this phone lacks, compared to many higher-end phones, are features such as NFC, wireless charging and quick charging. It's also missing a microSD card slot for expandable storage, but the trend is finally moving away from such ports -- the recent Samsung flagships, such as the Galaxy Note 5 , also do without the microSD slots.. To ensure compatibility with high-speed 4G LTE networks, OnePlus will be selling three different versions of the phone. There's one that works with US 4G carriers; a global version that works in the UK, Australia and Asia; and one model just for China. If you're thinking of getting the phone, make sure the phone is compatible with your region, or you'll end up without 4G. As a GSM device, it will send and receive calls and texts on all GSM carrier networks.. In the US, this means the phone will work on AT&T and T-Mobile networks, but not Verizon or Sprint.. Last year's OnePlus One launched with CyanogenMod , a custom Android build that isn't issued by Google. This year's OnePlus 2 comes with the company's own OxygenOS right out of the box. OxygenOS is a custom skin that's very close to stock Android, and is based on Android Lollipop 5.1 (the latest version of Android).. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

Press enter or click on the search icon. Battery Life, Sound Quality and Verdict. HDR and camera speed performance just OK. Snapdragon 810 processor with 3/4GB RAM. When my colleague Andrew Williams first reviewed the OnePlus 2 last year, he was enamoured with it – and rightly so. OnePlus was selling a smartphone with specs that could rival the flagships of 2015 and, better still, for a lowly price of £239. Purchase was by invitation only, but if you could get your hands on one, the OnePlus 2 was a steal. A lot has changed since then. You don’t need an invite to buy the OnePlus 2 anymore. And a brief check on the OnePlus UK store tells me that the 16GB £239 version is no longer available. Instead, OnePlus is now selling just the 64GB OnePlus 2, albeit at a discounted £249 (down from the £289 launch price). I used the OnePlus 2 for about nine months, and only recently traded it out for a Samsung Galaxy S7. This phone was my daily driver and was, for the most part, great. The camera took nice pictures, battery life and storage were never an issue, and the griptape back offered welcome friction to my buttery fingers. But the halcyon days of 2015 are over, and I now have some serious complaints about the OnePlus 2. The first issue is charging, and the sheer slowness of it. The OnePlus 2 might use a USB-C connection, but that doesn’t mean you’ll get fast charging. In fact, the OnePlus 2 generally took just north of two hours to charge from empty to full. Charging the Galaxy S7, by comparison, is…well, there’s no comparison. Fast-charging devices are the future, leaving the OnePlus 2 feeling like a bit of a relic. The second issue is performance, and this is the big one. We’ve received plenty of complaints about the OnePlus 2 from readers, all of which claim that the phone has slowed down significantly since purchase. The OnePlus 2 often slowed to a crawl for no apparent reason. Near the end, I was having to reboot the phone at least three or four times a week. But here at TrustedReviews, we’re all about the actual numbers. In our original review, the Geekbench 3 score for the OnePlus 2 was 4,460. I recently ran 10 tests on the phone, giving me a new average score of 3,654 – with a low of 2,121. That’s not great, but it’s not a huge drop either. In any case, this probably isn’t the real root of OnePlus 2 performance problems. That’s because once an app is running on the OnePlus 2, it tends to work just fine. But switching between apps, loading apps, and other multi-tasking functions often – and inexplicably – make the device unusable. What’s telling in this regard is how much the RAM write speed has dropped since our original review. Back in 2015, tests showed that the OnePlus 2 managed an 8,000MB/s write speed. But now the average (over 10 tests) has dropped to 4,494MB/s – that’s with a high of 5,061MB/s, and a low of 1,223MB/s. The storage read and write speeds are similarly concerning. The original storage write speed for the OnePlus 2 was 125MB/s. The original storage read speed for the OnePlus 2 was 234MB/s. To make matters worse, the OnePlus 2 was marketed as the ‘2016 flagship killer’. But as is evident by the performance drop, that’s simply not true. The last 12 months have brought us a smorgasbord of powerhouse flagships – like the Nexus 6P, the Samsung Galaxy S7, and the HTC 10 – all of which run rings around the ailing OnePlus 2. To be fair, OnePlus tells us that it is trying to address these issues with software updates, but a quick search online shows that customers are still experiencing issues, and have been for a while.. The OnePlus 2 is a phone that looks like good value for money on paper, but it’s not the 2016 flagship killer it was marketed as. If you need a cheap phone, the OnePlus 2 isn’t a bad choice. But if you have the extra money to spare, I’d recommend grabbing an actual 2016 flagship instead. Hopefully the company’s rumoured OnePlus 3 will fare better when/if it arrives later this year. Buy Now: OnePlus 2 at Amazon.com from $274. You can check out our full OnePlus 2 review below.. Just like the OnePlus One, the OnePlus Two hits the bullseye. It offers a slick build and a spec-list that matches most of the far pricier high-end devices, like the Samsung Galaxy S6. Oh, and it only costs £239.. You still have to battle with the annoying invite system and even though the phone has been out a few months you can’t just go onto the website and buy one. It lacks NFC too, which isn’t ideal if you want to take advantage of Android Pay.. If you’re happy to spend £400-500 and money is not a major concern, phones like the Nexus 6P and iPhone 6S still top the OnePlus 2. But for the money it’s hard to argue against..

You need an invite to even be able to order the thing and, at the time of writing, they aren’t too easy to get hold of.. The cynics among you may think: what better way to breed hype and anticipation than by limiting stock? Such thoughts aren’t groundless, but if there was a middle-man retailer or network in-between, you can bet the OnePlus 2 would not cost £239. There’s a lot of new-model marketing behind the phone, but that the thing is hard to get hold of isn’t just something made up by the OnePlus marketing department.. Related: OnePlus 2 vs Samsung Galaxy S6. In person it certainly doesn’t seem like the hype machine that is OnePlus’s online presence has overshadowed the OnePlus 2’s design. It’s a phone that feels great, and is at home when sat next to more expensive mobiles like the HTC One M9 and LG G4.. Unlike the mostly-plastic OnePlus One, the OnePlus 2 has sides made of magnesium alloy. This feels a lot like aluminium. A little less cool to the touch perhaps, but we bet more than 50% of OnePlus 2 owners who haven’t pored over the spec sheet would assume it’s aluminium, as used in the iPhone 6 and HTC One M9.. Related: 13 Best Smartphones and Mobile Phones. One of the benefits of magnesium alloy is that it’s a bit lighter than aluminium. However, the OnePlus 2 is not a particularly light phone at 175g. It’s 20g heavier than the LG G4, which is no small amount in the phone world.. On first getting our hands on the OnePlus 2, this extra weight was quite obvious. But the sum total of our reaction was to silently think “cor, this one has some meat on it”, before promptly forgetting its size and weight more-or-less completely.. It’s a non-issue for those with moderate-to-large hands. And if you have smaller mitts, the OnePlus 2 lets you switch between hardware soft keys and software ones, and you can flip the ‘back’ and lesser-used ‘recent apps’ soft keys around. With or without a tweak, the soft keys are fairly easy to reach.. Still, if having a super-slim phone is top of your wishlist, the OnePlus 2 doesn’t really fit the bill at 9.9mm thick. Related: 10 Best Android Phones. As well as having that nice band of magnesium alloy to tart up its design, the OnePlus 2’s back feels quite unusual. Sharing the same back texture as the OnePlus One, the rear feels a little rough and fuzzy, almost closer to a sort of fabric than anything else.. It’s a high-friction, tactile surface that we’re honestly surprised not to have been adopted by anyone else (to our knowledge) since we saw it in the OnePlus One. However, there are mixed reviews on it from the Trusted team, and if the thought of your phone feeling like a shaved hamster doesn’t appeal, there are other covers on offer.. These come with a £20 price bump, but feature ‘real’ materials, including kevlar and various kinds of wood. Kevlar and the standard grey-black rear are the best picks if you want a low-key phone.. The rear can be prised off with a finger easily enough, and while it doesn’t give you access to the battery, it does mean the OnePlus 2 can avoid using one of those SIM slots that needs a pin/tool to unlock. There are two SIM slots, both nano-size, and both fit into a single piece of plastic that slots into the body.. There’s no waterproofing here, and no microSD card either, so be sure to choose carefully between the £239 16GB and £289 64GB versions. It’s the best choice if you want to store a lot of music on your phone.. Both versions come with a few neat little hardware extras you don’t see on most other phones. First, there’s a little 3-way switch on the left side of the OnePlus 2 that turns all notifications off, only allows priority notifications and lets the lot through.. It’s a neat way to silence your phone quickly, although you do need to remember not to check you’ve not accidentally set the thing to silent if you’re expecting a phone call.. Most phones have a microUSB 2.0 slot. Some phones even have a a microUSB 3.0 slot, like the Samsung Galaxy S5. However, the OnePlus 2 has a USB-C socket. This is likely to be the successor to microUSB, and the main benefit is that it’s reversible. The downside is that you can’t use any cables you’ve accrued over the years to charge the phone. And if you lose the cable, replacing it could be a pain. It’s only really the socket that has changed too. You don’t get USB 3.0 speed. We like USB-C, but at this point using it is a mixed blessing.. The most important extra hardware feature, though, is the fingerprint scanner. Taking inspiration from the iPhone Touch ID sensor and, more recently, the Samsung Galaxy S6 scanner, it sits under the Home soft key on the front of the phone.. Crucially, you don’t need to swipe your finger over it, just hold it there. We’ve found this is a vital part of making a phone finger scanner quick and easy to use.. Sure enough, the OnePlus 2 scanner is another winner. While it’s a bit slower than the iPhone 6 scanner, it’s about as reliable and still quicker than using a pattern or pin for security. You can teach the phone up to five fingerprints, and 99% of the time we ended up using a thumb. Two down, three to donate if you like.. The OnePlus 2 scanner does not sit on a physical button like the iPhone 6’s, though. The sensor pad is static, its indent there to give you a physical guide as to where your finger needs to be.. Like the other two soft keys, which are lit-up with simple blue dashes, it’s a touch-sensitive pad rather than a clicky button. Just fitting in features like a fingerprint scanner, let alone a good one, at £239 is impressive. However, there are a few omissions to balance this out. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

The OnePlus 2 — a follow-up to the popular OnePlus One —was officially unveiled on July 27, 2015 after much fanfare. OnePlus did its standard marketing scheme of slowly trickling out specs and information about the phone, followed by a full release where we finally found out everything about it.. The OnePlus 2 is powered by a Snapdragon 810 octa-core processor, as we've seen in other high-end phones, and it's paired up with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. A 5.5-inch display is the same size as the first-generation, but is an IPS LCD with in-cell touch technology, higher brightness and better contrast than last year's. The OnePlus 2 has a 3300 mAh battery inside, and also has a new USB-C connector for easier plugging in. A 13MP camera is on the back, with laser auto focusing and optical image stabilization.. Though the phone has the same basic size and shape as the original, the frame is now metal and feels much more solid. It also has a new "alert switch" on the side that toggles the phone between different notification modes, which isn't something you usually see on Android phones. The same StyleSwap replaceable covers are here as well, but you can now choose between five different ones — bamboo, rosewood, black apricot, sandstone black and kevlar — right at launch.. The price for all of this? Just $389 unlocked in the U.S. — that's a bit more expensive than the first iteration, but there are some great steps forward in this model that likely make the price worth it. There will also be a less-expensive model with just 16GB of storage and 3GB of RAM, with all of the other components being the same. The price is $329 in the US and similarly less expensive in other markets, and is coming in Q4 of 2015..

It's managed to conquer the tricky second album with a smartphone which builds on its predecessor in a number of ways without losing its core appeal.. No microSD, NFC or fast charging. Design Standard back plate doesn't feel premium Alternative backs are offered - for a price A handy mute switch gives the OnePlus 2 something rivals lack. Update : The OnePlus Two remains a strong choice for those looking for an affordable, yet powerful unlocked Android smartphone.. However, with the rumored OnePlus 3T to be announced shortly, that will likely put the OnePlus 3 within the OnePlus Two's current price bracket.. Will it ever come to the OnePlus Two? Fingers are of course crossed, but OnePlus will probably focus its efforts on the OnePlus 3 and the next phone coming soon.. That's probably the best way to describe the OnePlus 2. After the surprise success of the OnePlus One there were big expectations for its successor, so has the fledgling Chinese brand delivered?. OnePlus dubbed its second phone 'the 2016 Flagship Killer', a claim that was more than a little far-fetched. So how about a more grounded claim of 'the 2015 Flapship Killer'? If OnePlus bangs that drum instead, then it might just be onto something.. The price tag on the OnePlus 2 remains well below that of the phones it's aiming to rival – the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S6 , iPhone 6S and HTC One M9 – with it now costing $299/£249 (around AU$390) after receiving a price drop in May 2016.. That's for a 64GB version of the handset. Originally the company sold a 16GB version of the OnePlus 2, but OnePlus has now dropped it and slashed the price of the 64GB model.. At this price the OnePlus 2 has the Moto X Style for company, along with the LG G4 , which has had some price cuts of its own. The OnePlus 2 is still pricier than the lower mid-range OnePlus X (though the X has been discontinued and is increasingly hard to find), but comes in well below the newer OnePlus 3 , which costs $399/£329 (around AU$450).. A quick flick through the spec sheet and you'll likely be impressed with the bang for your buck offered by the OnePlus 2.. It's not without its flaws however. There's no NFC , no microSD and no fast or wireless charging options; and, while the rear plate can be removed, the battery cannot.. These may be viewed as minor imperfections by some, but when your company's motto is 'Never Settle', is the OnePlus 2 letting down its fans?. The OnePlus 2 isn't the easiest phone to come by either. Luckily the invite-only sales approach has been dropped by the company so now you can buy one - with free delivery - from the OnePlus site without any concerns, though it remains unavailable on networks.. The price is still low and the specs are tempting. So has OnePlus managed to bring together all the elements for its second hit, or will the OnePlus 2 fail to chart? Let's find out.. I forgave the OnePlus One's functional, plastic design last year as it was the first phone from the startup, and the price tag knocked our socks off. This time around though the market is expecting more, and OnePlus has delivered.. The OnePlus 2 sports a sturdy metal frame around its circumference, giving the handset a premium look and feel. It's a similar design choice to the Samsung Galaxy Alpha and Note 4 , with the rear retaining a removable plastic back plate.. It's with this black plate however, that I have my first gripe. The default rear for the OnePlus Two is a textured grey affair which has the roughness of sandpaper. It means there's a whole heap of grip – something I miss when grappling with the iPhone 6S Plus – but it doesn't feel comfortable, nor premium in the hand.. That's a shame, as the metal frame round the edge gives the handset an air of sophistication which could see it in a higher price tier, but the rear reminds you that in order to deliver such a low price point some corners still need to be cut.. It's not all bad news though, as OnePlus is more than happy to sell you an alternative rear cover – choose from bamboo, rosewood, black apricot wood or Kevlar – for $18.89/£13.99.. I've tried these options out during an exclusive OnePlus event, and I can confidently say they feel better than the default offering – as long as you don't mind spending a little extra cash.. Peel the rear cover off and you're greeted by a black plastic body with a dual-SIM tray towards the top-left of the phone – pull this out and you'll find space for two nanoSIMs.. Unlike in some Huawei handsets, the second SIM slot doesn't double as a microSD tray, so you're stuck with the 64GB of internal storage.. In terms of size, the phone is similar to the OnePlus One, with the 5.5-inch display forcing the size of the handset to an extent. It has gained thickness, moving from 8.9mm to 9.9mm, while weight has increased from 162g to 175g. This makes it larger and heftier than the 7.4mm thick, 158g OnePlus 3.. I didn't find it overbearing in the hand though, with an even balance making it easy to hold. You will need to perform some shuffling during one-handed use if you want to reach the fingerprint scanner at the base or the top of the display, which can lead to some near-drop experiences.. The power/lock key, located on the right below the volume rocker, falls nicely under your thumb/finger, making it easy to locate and hit, while on the opposite side there's a novel sliding switch.. This slider enables you to quickly toggle your notifications between three states: off, priority only and all. I found this especially useful when diving into a meeting, as a quick slide of the switch to its top position meant no interruptions.. There's an LED notification light on the front, so you can still be alerted to new notifications without having to touch the handset, but you can turn this off in the settings if you prefer.. This isn't a new idea, and iPhone users will be screaming at their screens that Apple's smartphones have had a silent toggle since the beginning of time. Sure, it's not innovation, but it's a handy addition to the OnePlus 2.. The OnePlus 2 builds positively on the design of the OnePlus One, bringing with it a more premium and refined style which makes it look and feel like a more expensive handset. This makes it easier to take seriously as a flagship contender, at least by 2015 standards – just as long as you swap out that sandpaper default rear for a real wood finish..

OnePlus 2 review Affordable, beautiful, but not without its flaws. by Joshua Vergara August 27, 2015. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Metal frame holds together a great design. Display is better than before, one of the best 1080p screens. Performance is off the charts, when software doesn't bog it down. Plenty of new features make OnePlus 2 really feel different. USB Type C nice but ultimately adds nothing (no fast charging). Camera app slow, needs to take advantage of OIS and laser autofocus better. Oxygen OS buggy, crashes at times (Fingerprint reader causes issues for pre-lockscreen apps). The OnePlus 2 is solidly and beautifully designed but shows a few glaring blemishes underneath the surface.. RAM 3 or 4 GB (depending on storage option). Networks US GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900MHz WCDMA: Bands: 1/2/4/5/8 FDD-LTE: Bands: 1/2/4/5/7/8/12/17EU/India GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900MHz WCDMA: Bands: 1/2/5/8 FDD-LTE: Bands: 1/3/5/7/8/20. Software OxygenOS based on Android 5.1. Dimensions 151.8 x 74.9 x 9.85 mm, 175g. The sophomore release by OnePlus tried to capture the viral momentum enjoyed by the first, and apart from the now expected drawn-out teaser campaign, the company made a splash right off the bat by announcing the device through a full VR presentation. The follow up brings with it some forward thinking features while boasting a respectable price point, but does match up to the hype? We find out, in this comprehensive review of the OnePlus 2 !. A metal frame with a number of new features further enhances the previous OnePlus formula, and to good effect. For starters, the presence of metallic material this time around automatically makes for a more premium looking and feeling device when compared to its predecessor. Despite retaining the same display size as before, the OnePlus 2 has a slightly smaller overall footprint that results in a handling experience that is a touch better than before.. The button layout has been altered as well, with the volume rocker moving to the right side above the power button, to make way for the new Alert Slider on the left, which is essentially a notification toggle, to easily switch between the three notification priority modes available with Lollipop, which are to allow all notifications,. set it to allow only priority notifications, or to completely silence the phone.. Up front is still a 5.5-inch display, which now has a divot below it that houses the capacitive home button and integrated fingerprint scanner. This is flanked by the back and recent apps capacitive keys, designated with lines, which is a nice touch. Another change in terms of design and hardware comes in the form of the new USB Type-C connector at the bottom, flanked by speaker grills.. The backing of the OnePlus 2 comes with the same sandstone black material seen with its predecessor, and continues to be a design choice that is very unique to OnePlus. The sandpaper feel, while allowing for good grip, may not be for everybody and that is why it is great to see that OnePlus has made the back cover much easier to remove, without the need for any additional tools, allowing you to comfortably switch between any of the available StyleSwap covers.. There were no issues with the handling of this phone, which is always a big plus when it comes to devices with large displays, and the solid build quality of the phone will certainly be appreciated by any user. Overall, the OnePlus 2 is a really premium feeling device, especially when compared to its predecessor. When considered against the rest of the competition, OnePlus has done a great job of keeping their design language and elements distinct and unique.. The OnePlus 2 comes with 5.5-inch LTPS LCD display with a 1920 x 1080 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 401 ppi. While the size falls within the realm of current Android smartphone standards, the resolution doesn’t live up to the Quad HD performers that dominate the current flagship scene. That’s not to say that the OnePlus 2 does not allow for a fantastic display experience, though.. With a bump in brightness and color saturation, elements on the screen look great in any situation, with really good outdoor visibility as well. The brightness may have been bumped up just a little too much though, as colors start to get a little blown out at the highest brightness setting, but thankfully that’s not a point where most users will have it set to. That said, the OnePlus 2 display does manage to be as good as we hoped it would be, and is every bit as good, if not better, than the rest of the Full HD displays out there, though a Quad HD resolution would have been more fitting for this “flagship killer.”. Under the hood the OnePlus 2 comes with an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, clocked at 1.8 GHz, backed by the Adreno 430 GPU and 3 GB or 4 GB of RAM, depending on whether you opt for the 16 GB or 64 GB version of the device. This is still one of the best processing packages currently available and 4 GB of RAM should make the spartan Oxygen OS fly, which was the case for the most part. The power of the processor is not in question however, as the Oxygen OS is more to blame for a number of bugs and a few crashes that have occurred in our usage.. Everything from browsing to gaming has been a treat, with minimal slow down even while playing the most graphically-intensive of games. It has to be mentioned here that the Snapdragon 810 did get a bit warm under heavy load, but only slightly beyond what was expected, and certainly not as much as some claims might suggest.. Again, the only big problems we had in usage seem to be the fault of the Oxygen OS more than anything. TweetCaster, for example, just doesn’t seem compatible, and crashes occurred when performing tasks just before the fingerprint security wall, such as when accessing the camera from the lockscreen without unlocking the phone first. Overall speed through daily tasks is a non-issue though, and with the Oxygen OS getting the updates it needs, we’re sure that it will eventually be every bit as stable as it is fast.. In hardware, there are quite a few new additions in the OnePlus 2 when compared to its predecessor, starting with fingerprint scanner. Setting up the scanner is a familiar procedure, and once done, it is possible to just rest a finger on the reader even when the screen is off and the device will unlock in no time, which is great way to use a fingerprint reader.. The issue I faced was with getting the placement of the finger correct. I had trouble triggering the fingerprint scanner consistently, as well as some difficulty when using it as a home button. I found having to cover the whole area with the finger the best way to make it work, even when using it as a home button, and that can take some getting used to.. Moving to the sides, the new Alert Slider is an easy way of basically silencing the phone. The textured feel of the slider makes it easy to find when the device is on a table or in your pocket, and just sliding the button all the way to the top silences the device.. Removing the back cover reveals dual SIM card slots, which is a somewhat foreign concept for western users. While the best use of this feature is when it comes to travel, you do have the ability to cater your texts, calls, and data from either SIM card. I used both AT&T and T-Mobile SIM cards with the device, and the only real issue was with regards to the time it takes to change which card is used for data. It does take some time to finally switch over, but if you are impatient, restarting the phone helps.. Rounding out the new hardware additions is the new USB charging port, which means the need for a completely different cord. A new standard will always take a little time to get used to, but thankfully, OnePlus is making this flat red cable available at a very low price, so if nothing else, the company is helping to make USB Type-C a reality. This implementation does come with some sacrifices though, mainly when it comes to fast charging capabilities.. The OnePlus 2 packs a large 3,300 mAh non-removable battery, and with the right brightness settings and other due diligence, I was able to get as much as an impressive 4.5 hours of screen-on time with the device. Where OnePlus did miss the mark, however, was with regards to the charging time. Charging the device from 0 to 100 required around 2 hours, which isn’t terribly slow, but simply pales in comparison to any fast charging solutions out there. Despite the Snapdragon 810 coming with fast charging capabilities, they simply aren’t taken advantage of with the OnePlus 2, and without any wireless charging option either, plugging in the device to charge feels like a bit of a chore.. One of the most talked about omissions on the hardware side of things is, of course, NFC. It isn’t just about missing out on the future of NFC-based payment services, but for me, NFC was missed any time I wanted to connect the OnePlus 2 to my speakers or headphones. The lack of NFC may or may not be a deal breaker for you, depending on your usage, and while it wasn’t a huge problem for me, its absence was noticeable.. As far as audio is concerned, the device packs a speaker setup that is now bottom-firing and certainly gets the job done, and even attempts to go the extra mile with MAXXAudio enhancements. When using the speakers, any changes in the application basically makes the audio louder, with not a lot of body being added in. The enhancements are better felt when using headphones, as the different modes for Movie, Game, and Music, can be used appropriately. The Game mode makes the audio much louder, Movie mode goes for a lower volume while trying to emphasize the higher ends for dialogue, and the Music mode will be somewhere in the middle, depending on your settings.. As you may have noticed, the section with the most to talk about was in hardware, and while all the new additions and changes are welcome and forward thinking, the actual execution is somewhat uneven.. The 13 MP rear shooter from its predecessor returns here, along with a 5 MP front-facing unit, but the rear camera now comes with the additional benefit of optical image stabilization and a laser-guided auto focus system.. The camera application is very simple for now, but future updates will introduce more manual controls and further control over the settings. Modes that are currently baked in include panorama, 4K video recording, slow motion video capture at 120 fps in a 720p resolution, and even a Time Lapse function. It isn’t a slow app by any means, but the main gripe with it was when it came to changing modes. Swiping up and down on the viewfinder worked fine, until getting to panorama, when it would always go to the portrait orientation, and the need to change positions was something I never got used to. The speed of the app itself is pretty average, and while taking a shot can be quick, the device takes a bit of time to finally create the JPEG.. The picture quality is mostly decent and is mainly bogged down by an uneven execution in the new features. The laser auto focus needs to be triggered better by the app, which doesn’t get proper focus upon launch. Spot focusing and metering are always required right off the bat, instead of the expected automatic focusing on a subject that is clearly in the middle. OIS is a welcome addition, but with the camera app opting for very slow shutter speeds in low light conditions, all the image stabilization in the world won’t be able to deal with the movement. As was also the case with the OnePlus One, really steady hands are required just about all the time.. When all the pieces come together, however, pictures have a good level of saturation without looking doctored, and details are captured really well, with HDR also doing an excellent job of making photos pop. You just have to be diligent with the spot focusing and metering to ensure you actually have the right levels in both, and this is definitely an area that OnePlus needs to improve on with future updates.. The OnePlus 2 camera isn’t a bad companion to have as a primary shooter, but it does fail to match the current flagship standards due to an app that doesn’t fully leverage all of the tools available.. Finally, on the software side of things. The OnePlus 2 runs Oxygen OS, which is a very spartan version of Android. Much of what you see on the surface will be very familiar, with the user interface basically feeling like the Google Now launcher with some customization built-in, and more to play with when you dig deeper.. Aside from the notification dropdown and quick settings that can be moved around, the new software features are found in the settings. There is a Dark Mode, that makes all the usually bright portions of the user interface dark, which is a great tweak to use when in lower light environments, and is actually really nice and helpful. App Permissions come to the Oxygen OS before the new Android M release, and though a majority of users may not dive into this page, the ability to see what applications have access to what, and possibly turn them off, will please anyone that wants that extra peace of mind.. Aside from that, there are the features that we’ve already seen before, like the ability to switch between capacitive keys and on-screen navigation keys, and gestures on a turned off screen can still be used to quickly access the camera, the flashlight, or the phone itself.. The most obvious addition to this otherwise very stock Android version is Shelf, which essentially replaces Google Now on the left of the homescreens. Though, at first glance, it looks like a HTC Sense Home widget with frequent apps, favorite contacts, and a user defined cover up top, this page can actually house any and all other widgets as well, allowing you to free up space on the homescreens. All of the widgets will be put in cards however, so there might be a lot of free space around any widgets that aren’t 4 cells wide and at least a few cells high.. There isn’t much else with Oxygen OS 2.0, and while there will some updates for bug fixes and other new features, the way the OS operates right now is pretty snappy, smooth, and minimalistic. Perhaps future versions of the OS will look like more than just a new take on stock Android, but until then, it is a somewhat customizable OS that feels more familiar than anything else.. The OnePlus 2 does once again require an invite to purchase, which will be a disappoint. to many people, but at least the company has been taking measures to ensure their stock will meet the demand. That said, the demand is even higher for this phone compared to the original, largely owed to the fact that the pricing is extremely aggressive here with the 16GB model at $329 and the 64GB at $389. While a bit more expensive than the OPO, this is a great price considering all the new features introduced here.. So, there you have it for this in-depth look at the OnePlus 2! With all that we’ve experienced with the OnePlus 2, it is easy to see that this is a flagship device, through and through, but it won’t be killing any other really high end devices any time soon. We can’t fault OnePlus for keeping the features in line with the price point, but calling the OnePlus 2 a “flagship killer” feels like a stretch this year.. The OnePlus One was born of a different era, when Quad HD and overachieving cameras were yet to become reality. In the current high-end market, OnePlus has simply met the standard, not exceeded. Whether or not OnePlus truly succeeds depends on your needs, but it has to be said that the OnePlus 2 is an incredibly solid device that is marred by inconsistent execution. In the areas that it really needed to succeed, it just missed the mark, mainly, in camera and bugs in the operating system, but these can all be fixed with future updated.. Nonetheless, we do think the OnePlus 2 deserves to be among best – even if its impact is not quite as huge as it was last year.. OnePlus 2 , Smartphone Reviews.

The OnePlus 2 (also abbreviated as OP2 ) is a smartphone designed by OnePlus. It is the successor to the OnePlus One. OnePlus revealed the phone on July 28, 2015 via virtual reality , using Google 's Cardboard visor and their own app. OnePlus sold out 30,000 units of the OnePlus 2 in China within 64 seconds after launching the product sale. 2 Release and distribution. 3.1 Design and hardware. On 25 January 2015, OnePlus announced the smartphone's official name as OnePlus 2. [8] It was also later reported that the OnePlus 2 would have a late 2015 release, possibly due to hardware issues with its processor. In early-April 2015, OnePlus confirmed the OnePlus 2 will not feature wireless charging and NFC. Subsequently, (on 29 June 2015), it was confirmed that the device will also feature a fingerprint sensor , which is similar to Apple 's Touch ID .. In October 2015, OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei said that the OnePlus 2 will be the only flagship from the company for the year 2015, but another phone called the OnePlus X [10] has been released.. OnePlus posted that it will use an invite system to handle sales of the OnePlus 2, exclusively through the company's website, like the OnePlus One. [11] OnePlus claims that the invite system is more efficient than the invite system used for the sales of the OnePlus One, the OnePlus 2's predecessor. According to co-founder Carl Pei, there will be 30 to 50 times more invites from the start to match the greater demand for the OnePlus 2. Within 72 hours of being launched, the OnePlus 2 had already accumulated over 1 million reservations. [13] Within one week after being launched, the OnePlus 2 had accumulated over 2 million reservations. [14] As of September 2015, it has accumulated over 5 million reservations.. In September, 2015, the OnePlus 2 became available in Israel without an invite, through its exclusive distributor, C-DATA. This came after buyers complained of buying the OnePlus 2 (without an invite) that came preloaded with malware. On 12 October 2015, OnePlus held its first open-sale for 1 hour from 12-1 PM HKT / CEST / PDT exclusively to 32 countries via the company's website, with the exception of China , Malaysia , Indonesia , Israel and Singapore. This did not go flawlessly as the website's back-end could not handle the load. Due to this, the 1 hour sale was extended for another hour. In India, the sale ran for the entire day via sales partner Amazon.in. A week later (on 19 October 2015), Malaysian carrier Maxis offered the OnePlus 2 invite-free for MYR 1788 ($420) exclusively via the Maxis Website. The OnePlus 2 features a revamped design meant to put it at the top with the rest of its flagship competitors. The handset incorporates an aluminum - magnesium alloy chassis , with the volume and power keys along with the new notifications control switch featuring a polished stainless steel accent and with the rear of the phone accompanied with a textured Sandstone Black plastic back cover. [18] [19] User also have the choice to customize back covers with choices of Kevlar or assorted wood offerings including bamboo , black apricot , and rosewood. Compared to its predecessor the phone is 1. mm shrunken height and width-wise but 8% thicker and heavier due in part to its larger 3,300 mAh battery. [20] The OnePlus 2 and its predecessor, the OnePlus One, have comparable displays, each 5.5" LCD 1920 x 1080 full HD resolution screens, with Corning Gorilla Glass protection. New to the OnePlus 2 is its fingerprint sensor which can optionally serve as a capacitive home button, along with back and multitasking navigation keys, but they can be disabled in favor of customizable navigation " soft keys " rendered on-screen. There are two versions of the OnePlus 2. The White Basic version features 16 GB internal storage, and 3 GB LPDDR4 RAM. The Sandstone Black Premium version has 64 GB internal storage with 4 GB LPDDR4 RAM. [22] The handset is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 v2.1 64-bit octa-core chip purposefully underclocked to 1.8 GHz to avoid any overheating issues. [23] The system on chip also includes an Adreno 430 graphics processor clocked at 630. For its rear-facing camera, the OnePlus 2 utilizes an OmniVision OV13860 13- megapixel image sensor with features including a 1/2.6-inch sensor size, f/2.0 aperture , [25] laser autofocus, [26] optical image stabilization , dual tone LED flash, 4K and slow motion 720p video recording ability. Compared to its competitors the Samsung Galaxy S6 and LG G4 which both have 16-megapixel sensors, the smaller megapixel count of the OnePlus 2, "allows for individual pixels to be made bigger. Bigger pixels capture more light per pixel than smaller ones and this, in turn, reduces the amount of digital noise or 'grain' showing up in photos, especially in low light situations." [27] The front-facing camera contains a wide-angle 5-megapixel camera. Other features include a dual SIM (nano SIM) card layout with 4G LTE compatibility [24] and the handset is the first smartphone with a worldwide release to feature a USB-C port. [18] [28] However features left out with controversy include lack of NFC hardware and quick charge capabilities found on many other flagships and resulting in full charges that could exceed 3 hours according to OnePlus. [29] [30] OnePlus explained that NFC was not used by enough OnePlus One users for NFC to reasonably be added to the OnePlus 2. Unlike the OnePlus One, which shipped a single model worldwide, the 2 will ship different models per region [32] (like most other manufacturers). As a consequence of this, 4G (LTE) connectivity may not be possible outside the region the phone was bought, due to different LTE standards. The OnePlus 2 comes preloaded with Android 5.1.1 "Lollipop" with OnePlus' OxygenOS version 2.0 on top of it. An update to OxygenOS version 2.2.1 was released for the OnePlus 2 in Feb 2016. [34] [35] In May'2016, OnePlus released an OTA update of Oxygen OS 3.0 with Android Marshmallow for its OnePlus 2 users.. Oneplus released updated version of Oxygen OS (OOS3.5.5) on Christmas Eve, this update mainly covered VoLTE enabled, gesture updates, enhanced UI and defect fixes. However, there were frequent network drop issues that led Oneplus team to stop the OTA. Oneplus Team quickly responded with fixing the defect and releasing the next version of Oxygen OS (OOS 3.5.6) that fixes all possible issues. Despite telling consumers that the OnePlus 2 would be updated to Android 7 "Nougat", it was eventually confirmed that this was not to happen, leaving the device on the older Android 6.0.1. OnePlus released OxygenOS 3.6.0 in July 2017, with included Android security patch level 1st June 2017 and small fixes. It received an update OxygenOS 3.6.1 in October 2017, with included Android security patches, WPA2 security issues and general bug fixes & improvement. ^ Hong Kong and Taiwan not included. ^ China not included.

I bought the phone because the double sim card, I travel a lot so I can use the local sim but still get my calls from the states on my USA Sim. I heard some people complaining about the battery life but one can go through a day easily.. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned. by gman13676x Jul 26, 2017. I think it is one of the best I have had. One issue though was the camera. It worked at first for like a day or two then stopped working. Ordered a replacement module and it was easy to change out. Fingerprint scanner is a plus and having apps that will allow the fingerprint scanner instead of logging in manually is a great feature. Battery doesn't last too long when using power hungry game apps, but for just phone and some light browsing it should last all day.. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned. by jobooth-3 Jan 29, 2017. Awesome phone next best thing to a Nexus .. Awesome phone nice screen,body has a good feel just right ,performance is great zero lag. Development is also there so mods and ROMs galore.

Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ hands-on: The devil is in the details. OnePlus 2 review: a worthy sequel, flaws and all. I don't envy the team at OnePlus. After shipping a smartphone that made us rethink what we could get -- nay, what we deserved -- for $299, it was tasked with building an even better follow-up. If this were some schlocky '80s, teen coming-of-age film, it'd be time for a montage, but here we are a year later with a more confident, experienced startup and a new device that still promises to "never settle." At $329 for the basic 16GB model (or $389 for the 64GB version), the new OnePlus 2 isn't quite as wallet-friendly as the phone we got last year, and more than a few rivals have since come out with low-cost, high-power phones of their own. So, did OnePlus do the impossible again? Did it actually create a worthy sequel to a fan-favorite device, amid crazy competition in the world of cheap, fantastic unlocked phones? Well, yes, but it's not without its flaws.. Gallery: OnePlus 2 review | 24 Photos. Alert slider should be standard on all phones. No NFC means no mobile payments. Smartphone aficionados have been clamoring for the OnePlus 2 since, well, the days of the OnePlus One. Now it's here, and it's mostly great, especially if you're looking for horsepower. The second-gen version looks more expensive than it is thanks to its impressive build quality, and its powerful internals help the phone punch above its weight in performance tests. Still, the lack of NFC and expandable storage, along with a few software bugs (we're told they're being worked on), mean the OnePlus 2 won't be for everyone.. Last year's OnePlus One set a high bar for how much performance you could squeeze out of a $299 smartphone, and its sequel doesn't disappoint. Tucked away inside the 9.85mm-thick frame is one of Qualcomm's octa-core Snapdragon 810 chipsets partnered with either 3GB or 4GB of RAM, depending on which version you choose. You've also got a sealed 3,300mAh battery (and I do mean sealed; there's nothing but curved plastic under the battery cover), a tray that holds two nano-SIM cards and either 16GB or 64GB of internal storage. As our comments section continues to make clear, the lack of expandable memory options is a downright dealbreaker for some of you. I'm more of a "streaming everything" kind of guy so the 53GB of free space in the higher-end model I tested was more than enough, but keep that limit in mind before you punch someone in the face for an invite. Oh, and there's no NFC this time around, a puzzling omission that'll keep your OnePlus 2 from doubling as a wallet whenever Android Pay finally launches.. There's so much going on inside the OnePlus 2, in fact, that the designers clearly didn't feel the need to give it a brand-new look. What we got instead is a thoughtful refinement of the original's design that makes the whole thing feel more premium than its price tag suggests. To wit: The chassis itself is made of polycarbonate, but a magnesium and aluminum band runs around its sides, with drilled vents for the speaker and a USB Type-C charging port along the bottom. A quick look at the phone's left edge reveals something new: a three-stage notification slider that lets you select how obnoxious you want the phone to be when tweets, status updates and emails roll in. This is, in short, a revelation. It's a staggeringly useful addition, and other smartphone makers would do well to add something similar.. The most eye-catching addition is the fingerprint sensor that doubles as a home button. Pity that it's not as sensitive as it should be. It sometimes took multiple tries to unlock the phone with my finger (a reality, sadly, for just about any smartphone with biometric security) and you have to hit it with more force than you might expect. It's nice, in a way -- an ill-placed glancing blow won't disrupt your gaming sessions -- but I'd prefer more touch-pressure consistency between the home button and the two soft keys on either side of it.. If you've played with the original model, the OnePlus 2's back will seem like a blast from the past. The changes here are pretty modest, and they mostly boil down to the fact that the 13-megapixel camera and dual-LED flash have been shifted south a few millimeters. This time, though, the camera itself is sandwiched between the flash and an LED autofocus module that promises to lock onto targets in as little as 0.2 second. My review unit came with the company's trademark sandstone black rear panel, which has been a point of contention among the people I've shown it too. Some (myself included) love the gritty, tactile feel of the sandstone finish because it's so drastically different from the glass-and-metal monoliths we usually play with, but it just left others scratching their heads. You can swap it out for bamboo, Kevlar, black apricot or rosewood covers for a little extra cash, and don't worry: It's much, much easier to remove this time around.. All told, OnePlus did a wonderful job putting its second-generation flagship killer together. It's light, but not too light, and there's not an iota of give when you start twisting the device (not that you should really do that in the first place). Between the OnePlus 2's handsome design, sturdy construction and Gorilla Glass 4 screen you've got a real looker that can stand up to even the silliest drunken drops. trust me on that last bit.. We're looking at yet another 5.5-inch, 1080p IPS LCD display this year, which means the same number of pixels squeezed into each linear inch as the original OnePlus One (that's 401 ppi, to be exact). The rest of the madding crowd might be embracing those gorgeous Quad HD panels, but really -- we're hardly worse off with a full HD screen here, especially considering the cost. I wouldn't be surprised if a few people reading this could somehow pick out individual pixels on the OP2's high-def screen. Well, I can't anyway, and the staggering majority of people can't, either. You're not missing out on anything.. As you might expect from an IPS screen, viewing angles are great even from odd positions (good news for over-the-shoulder screen peekers). Just don't expect the punchy colors you'd get from a Samsung phone's AMOLED display. I happen to like when my retinas are scorched by saturated screens, but the OnePlus 2's is considerably less in-your-face. Things are even cooler and subtler here than on the LG G4's "Quantum display," which strove for eye-catching color accuracy above all else. All told, it feels a little dull, a little lifeless, but I might be in the minority on this one. Still, those subdued colors also mean viewing the screen in direct sunlight can be tricky (though cranking up the brightness helps).. Meanwhile, the single speaker on the phone's bottom side does a fine job belting out tunes, although things can get muddled when you crank up the volume. OnePlus included the MaxxAudio equalizer app for good measure, and you can toggle it from the volume shade if you need some extra oomph. Honestly, the equalizer's effects are more noticeable -- and more valuable -- when you're using them in tandem with a pair of headphones. Just be careful when MaxxAudio is enabled; I couldn't get the volume up to 50 percent without feeling like I was thrashing my eardrums.. Before we go any further, a brief software note: Our OnePlus 2 is running a pre-release build (A2005_14_150807, if you're curious), and the company tells us an OTA update that's "close" to what I have is going live shortly.. After a prolonged, public breakup (and at least one Taylor Swift joke ), the OnePlus 2 comes loaded with a mostly clean version of Android 5.1.1 with just a handful of OnePlus' custom OxygenOS interface tweaks for added flavor. I really do mean "clean," too. As I mentioned earlier, my 64GB model had 53GB of storage ready for me to use out of the box, and just about all of that reserved space is taken up by Android proper. There are only two preloaded apps to be found here -- that MaxxAudio equalizer and SwiftKey's not-for-me keyboard -- and both can be disabled without much headache. Too bad you can't uninstall them. The rest is basically unfettered Lollipop and it looks and runs just as nicely as you'd expect it to.. Now we're left with those Oxygen tweaks, most of which are surprisingly useful. There's a dark theme if you're tired of Material Design's decided whiteness, and you can fire up some onscreen navigation keys if the insensitive physical home button really gets on your nerves. OnePlus also cribbed a few notes from Oppo with its onscreen gestures, so drawing a circle or a V on the display while the phone is off launches the camera and flashlight, respectively. Oh, and a double-tap on the screen will rouse the phone from slumber, a la LG's most recent G series devices. Perhaps the biggest question mark is the Shelf, which you can access by swiping right on your home screen. It puts your most frequently used apps and contacts in one place, and throws in your local weather report and some space for widgets down at the bottom. It's nice to have, I guess, but I've used the feature precisely zero times over the last week (unless you count the times I just showed people it was there).. Gallery: A tour of the OnePlus 2's software | 21 Photos. Alas, not all is well with the OnePlus 2's software. Some third-party apps -- Todoist, Fenix, Falcon Pro, AquaMail, and Relay for Reddit, among others -- don't display properly because of a bug related to the way OxygenOS invokes Material Design's Light theme. Relay's probably the best, most publicized foul-up, as none of the comments on any Reddit post are visible, since they're rendered in white on a white background. Fenix and Falcon Pro, on the other hand, refuse to switch into their light themes. We're told that the team's working on a fix to be delivered in an update, but there's no public word on when that will arrive. Beyond those aesthetic issues, the OnePlus 2 is prone to random restarts; in fact, it happened while I was writing this very sentence. These random restarts happened about three times over the course of the week: twice while trying to launch the camera and once while it was just sitting on my desk charging. I'm really not sure what that's about; hopefully there's an update for that coming too. For what it's worth, OnePlus told us at least two OTA updates -- the one dropping now and another that seems focused on camera tweaks -- are coming, but wouldn't confirm whether the random reboots were fixed.. Last year's OnePlus One had a camera that didn't make for many thrills, so it's no surprise the team paid a little more attention to imaging and optics this time 'round. That 13-megapixel rear camera sensor sits behind an f/2.0 lens and it's better at sucking up photons because of its (relatively) large 1.3-micron pixel size. All that boils down to a mostly great shooting experience, especially when the sun's out or your lights are on. Just about all of my test photos had poppy, vibrant colors, along with plenty of detail.. Still, the camera shoots at a 4:3 aspect ratio so photos look a little odd on widescreen displays. It's surprisingly easy to get some good-looking shots while using the Auto mode, and OnePlus' controls are dead-simple. A quick tap of the shutter button snaps a photo, and you can fiddle with the exposure by tapping to focus on something and dragging a Sun icon around the focus ring. Swiping right lets you jump into video, panorama, slow-motion and time-lapse modes (all of which work exactly the way you'd expect), while a Clear Image mode stitches together multiple shots into one super-crisp photo. I wound up hardly ever using Clear Image, though, just because my normal photos usually came out looking great.. Gallery: OnePlus 2 camera samples | 17 Photos. Performance and battery life OnePlus 2 Samsung Galaxy S6 ZTE Axon LG G4 AndEBench Pro 9,945 10,552 7,961 8,352 Vellamo 3.0 3,025 3,677 3,086 4,065 3DMark IS Unlimited 23,598 21,632 24,802 18,572 SunSpider 1.0.2 (ms) 1,516 674 1,489 725 GFXBench 3.0 1080p Manhattan Offscreen (fps) 25 25 25 15 CF-Bench 79,168 62,257 62,117 71,260 SunSpider 1.0.2: Android devices tested in Chrome; lower scores are better. Smartphone cameras have a tendency to suck hard in low-light conditions, but the OnePlus 2 does a little better than you might expect. The autofocus (which normally works like a champ thanks to the laser module on the back) has a hard time doing its thing when your environs grow too dim, and after a while your photos come out murky and grainy. If your hand is steady enough, you can fire up the HDR mode to help mitigate some of these issues, but be prepared to see a bit of lag between shots while the phone processes your images. Really though, the steady hand trumps all; I managed to snap a sweet shot of the Ben Franklin Bridge without the help of HDR and didn't hate the results:. We can keep this bit relatively short: The OnePlus 2 moves with almost all the speed and fluidity you'd expect from a 2015 flagship phone. Qualcomm's octa-core Snapdragon 810 has gotten a bad rap since before day one because of its supposed overheating issues, but there's hardly any of that here -- just about everything runs incredibly smoothly, and games like Dead Trigger 2, The Talos Principle and Asphalt 8 never produced any hiccups, even at max graphics settings. Yes, you'll notice some warmth in the top half of the OnePlus 2's body during prolonged gaming sessions, but the sandstone cover seems to diffuse it nicely. All told, the heat was never unpleasant , per se. The reason I've been couching things with words like "almost" and "just about" is because I occasionally saw some apps take longer to launch than normal, if only by a second or two. It doesn't seem like cause for concern; I'd wager it's just a little Android flakiness and really, the issue sticks out more than it should because of how fast the phone is otherwise. Seriously, the OnePlus 2 brings the speed .. We're working with a sealed 3,300mAh cell here, and it stuck around for just over nine hours in the ol' Engadget rundown test (looping a video with WiFi on and the screen brightness set to 50 percent, in case you forgot). That puts the OnePlus 2 just ahead of both the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge , but LG's G4 still wins with its 11-hour runtime. And mind you, that's with a smaller, removable battery and a Quad HD screen. I'd be concerned for your well-being if you just watched videos on a phone for nine hours without moving, and thankfully the OnePlus 2 fares even better when you're going about your day. On average, I've been able to get through a full 12-hour workday (with lots of Hangouts chatting and YouTube videos, plus the occasional game and work email) with 15 or 20 percent left in the tank. Most people will only have to charge their OnePlus 2's once a day, which is definitely a good thing -- there's no QuickCharge here so the USB Type-C connector takes longer to charge the phone than most other flagships.. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: There's never been a better time to buy an unlocked smartphone. This year's crop of no-contract hardware has been first-rate, so keep these alternatives in mind before you make your decision. ZTE's $450 Axon threw me for a loop with its top-tier spec sheet and more-or-less clean version of Android. Audiophiles will dig its music-friendly software enhancements and performance tweaks, and the Quad HD display is pretty too, but be prepared to give yourself over to the cloud. There's only 32GB of internal storage and nary a memory card slot, an omission it shares with the OnePlus 2. I don't mind the lack of expandable memory as much as others do, but man: limiting users to only 32GB is pretty ridiculous. I'd recommend you stay away from the 16GB version of the OnePlus 2 as that's even more limited, but its $329 price is hard to argue with.. I'm also looking forward to seeing how the OP2 stacks up against Motorola's new $400 Moto X Pure , which pairs a hexa-core Snapdragon 808 with 3GB of RAM and a bigger 5.7-inch Quad HD screen. You'll be able to customize the dickens out of it once it launches, but that's not even the most important thing here. You see, software updates usually take ages to pass through carriers' rigorous testing and distribution processes. Motorola software chief Seang Chau told me this won't be the case , though: Since the company isn't going to sell the Pure edition through carriers, it has full control over how quickly it will receive new updates, as well as new versions of Android. Oh, and you won't have to scramble for an invite to buy one, either.. OnePlus has plenty to be proud of. After all, the company managed to make a phone that improved on the already-excellent original in every way that mattered. The OnePlus 2 is a powerful, well-built device, offering the best blend of price and performance you'll find in an unlocked phone. The thing is, the version I tried is still haunted by a few pesky software issues that should be fixed soon. Maybe it's a good thing you haven't gotten your invite yet.. Even if we put aside these fixable software flaws, it's clear this phone won't be for everyone. No NFC means you won't be using it to make Android Pay payments when the service launches later this year. The lack of a memory card slot means you'll have to be careful about what you download or shoot. It's easy to forgive these shortcomings because of the price -- the trade-off is a worthy one in my book -- but competitors like the Moto X Pure Edition didn't have to compromise nearly as much. In the end, the OnePlus 2 is worth your cash if you're looking for a capable, powerful Android phone on the cheap, but you'd do well to wait a few weeks to see how the competition stacks up.. android , mobile , mobilepostcross , oneplus , oneplus2 , oxygen , oxygenos , review , reviews , smartphone , uk-reviews , video.

'Papers, Please' official short film recreates the game's bleak tone. The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ hands-on: The devil is in the details. OnePlus 2 is a $329+ metallic upgrade with a beefed-up camera. Almost exactly 15 months ago, the OnePlus One made its debut as a $299 flagship smartphone to wow the geeks; and it's even been lowered to $249 as of last month. That, of course, is to make way for the company's next act, the OnePlus 2 (we were asked to stick with "2" instead of "Two"). This update is actually not all that secretive no thanks to the teasers and a recent leak , but that's not to say you should lose interest in it, especially given the improved camera, better display, extra RAM and the switch from plastic to a more resilient magnesium alloy frame. Not to mention that the 2 also comes with a USB Type-C port, a fingerprint reader, dual nano-SIM slots and a special "alert" slider. As for the OnePlus 2's price: the 64GB version will retail for $389 while the 16GB version will cost you $329. Gallery: OnePlus 2 | 30 Photos. It's interesting to see OnePlus adopting metal in favor of the cheaper plastic for its latest flagship, which explains why this new phone will cost a tad more than when its predecessor launched last year. That said, it's been well over a year for the first lot of OnePlus One users, so perhaps they won't mind the little extra cost for the much-anticipated update. And it's not just the change of material, either; take a closer look and you'll notice the subtle curve -- from the screen to the back side -- on the magnesium alloy frame. It's a bit like how Motorola crafted the latest Moto X, not as apparent, but still a nice touch. There are also stainless steel accents throughout that contribute to an overall more premium feel compared to the original.. Speaking of the back, yes, you can still swap the cover, but with much more ease this time: just pop it off from the bottom-left corner (after which you'll have access to the dual nano-SIM tray underneath). At launch, OnePlus will be offering four alternative covers -- Kevlar, bamboo, rosewood and black apricot -- should you wish to try something other than the black sandstone that comes with the phone. Bear in mind, however, that these StyleSwap covers will cost you around $27 each.. One notable addition to the OnePlus 2 is a special "alert slider" on the phone's left spine. Unlike the usual mute switch you would find on an iPhone, this one actually toggles among three different notification profiles: "None," which disables all notifications; "Priority," which only enables notifications from your priority contacts; and "All," which, you guessed it, enables all of them. Funnily enough, OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei said this idea actually came from a Reddit user who wanted to solve a small pain point: The "Do Not Disturb" button isn't always easy to find on Android. CEO Pete Lau doesn't want to stop there, though, because to him, disabling all notifications means you want total focus, so he's even considering some sort of lockdown mode that forbids you from using your OnePlus 2 until you flip the switch to either "Priority" or "All.". As with many other recent top-tier smartphones, the OnePlus 2 is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810, a chipset consisting of a 1.8GHz octa-core 64-bit processor and an Adreno 430 GPU. In light of said chip's overheating rumors from earlier this year, OnePlus specifically pointed out that it's using the cooler 810 v2.1, which, in combination with the thermal gel and graphite stuffed into the body, should keep the phone palm-friendly in most cases (Qualcomm tells us that "virtually all OEMs who have announced devices based on the Snapdragon 810 processor are currently using version 2.1"). We didn't feel the phone getting too warm in our brief hands-on, but we'd need more extensive testing to see if this is truly the case.. Other specs are as you'd expect on a flagship phone today: 3GB or 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, 16GB or 64GB of internal storage (no microSD expansion due to risk of hindering performance ), a 3,300mAh fixed battery and a near-native Android 5.1 in the form of OnePlus' OxygenOS. The latter offers a handful of innovative features beyond the default Lollipop interface. For one thing, it lets you toggle on-screen nav buttons on in case you dislike the capacitive hardware controls. You can also rearrange the order of those buttons and customize the look of the menu with "dark mode" and different accent colors.. The latest version of OxygenOS also introduces a beta feature called "Shelf," which you can access by swiping right on the home screen. It basically consists of a couple of default widgets of your frequently accessed apps and contacts, although a OnePlus spokesperson tells us that the company hopes to open up the Shelf API so that it can be customized further by developers.. What may appear to be a slight letdown would be the screen. On paper, it's the same 5.5-inch LCD with a 1080p resolution, rather than a sharper 2K option. Lau told me that he's not into the resolution war because 1080p is sufficient for most people; instead, he focused on improving the screen's clarity and brightness this time, because he found out that that's how the iPhone 6 Plus won over so many people. So if you place the One and 2 side by side, you should notice the improvement. But by itself, the OnePlus 2's display didn't strike us as particularly noteworthy at first glance. It's certainly brighter than most smartphones in its class (about 600 nits of brightness, we're told), but brightness alone won't necessarily make it stand out.. Beneath that display, you'll find another addition: a fingerprint reader. Unlike the Touch ID button on the iPhone, this particular version is entirely capacitive and is not "clickable" like other home buttons. We're told that the fingerprint reader is a hair faster than that of the iPhone -- less than 0.5 second -- and can hold up to five different profiles. On either side of it are the aforementioned capacitive navigation buttons which light up when they're in use. Another upside is that USB Type-C port: Few other smartphones have it, and even those are rarely available outside of Asia. The OnePlus 2 could very well be the first globally available handset to ship with it. Bonus: The USB cable it comes with is dual-reversible at both ends and promises to be tangle-free.. Camera-wise, don't be fooled by the same 13-megapixel and f/2.0 specs, because the real upgrade lies within the pixel size: A generous 1.3um instead of the common, but smaller 1.12um for this resolution, meaning it's more capable in dark environments and less prone to blurry shots. In addition to that, the new camera is assisted by optical image stabilization, laser autofocus and dual-LED flash. It's no wonder the OnePlus 2 is almost 1mm thicker and 0.46 ounce heavier; but who cares, right? Admittedly, the lowering of the camera looks funny and will take some getting used to, but it's designed that way so that your fingers are less likely to block the lens. On the other side of the phone, there's a 5-megapixel front-facing camera for those who seek to satisfy their selfie needs.. As nice as the OnePlus 2 is, we regret to bring you the sad news that it'll be launched with an invitation-based system on August 11th (Only the 64GB version will be available at launch; the 16GB version will come later). Yes, that does mean you'll have to keep an eye on OnePlus' forum, or ask around in the gym for some spare invites.. Update: OnePlus has confirmed that there's no NFC on its latest flagship, because "most of our users weren't using" it. It's certainly an odd move given that mobile payments are starting to take off.. android , android5.1 , china , featured , features , hands-on , oneplus , oneplus 2 , oneplus two , oxygenos , phone , snapdragon 810 , video.

Can I run this ROM in multiboot or dualboot setup?. You can but I won't accept bug reports or help anything related to that. How can I contribute to project?. Test the build as much as you can and report bugs which can be reproduced with exact steps and are not random. How to disable "Apps running in background" dialog?. When you see the dialog, long press on it and select "Settings". From there, you'll have a toggle to disable it. Where do I find button settings?. Old builds are moved here just in case If user wants to revert to it.

Chassis Screen Camera What’s The Catch?. One year ago, the OnePlus One became the best off-contract smartphone you could buy. An unheard of Chinese company managed to deliver a high-quality Android handset for a crazy-low $300 price. Now, it looks like that awesomeness wasn’t a fluke. Starting at $330, the new OnePlus 2 is only a hair more expensive than the original, and yet it’s improved in so many ways I barely know where to begin. Hell, it might be faster to tell you what’s missing: it doesn’t have a gorgeous 2K screen or wireless charging like the Galaxy S6, and it doesn’t have a removable SD card, battery, or fancy manual camera controls like the LG G4.. You weren’t expecting a stylus, were you?. Got all that? Then it’s time to talk about just how beastly this phone actually is. Two nano-SIMs for hopping carriers? You bet. USB Type-C so you’re ready for the future of charging ? Definitely. A fingerprint reader? Yep! Plus a 5.5-inch 1080p display, a 13-megapixel OmniVision camera with optical image stabilization and laser focusing, and up to 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM.. Yet the most impressive parts of the OnePlus One have little to do with specs. They’re about how this phone feels. The moment you touch this phone, you won’t believe it costs just $330. Why? Because in terms of materials and build quality, it’s only a stone’s throw away from the best you can buy: Samsung, LG and HTC devices that cost hundreds more.. If you turned up your nose at last year’s OnePlus One because it was made of plastic, you’ll do a double-take when a OnePlus 2 shows up. The only plastic you’ll find on this sucker is the flexible kind you’ll find when you pry up the removable rear cover. No more shitty plastic buttons, either: it’s all precise, tactile metal for your power button, volume rocker, and (my personal favorite) three-way mute switch. Click here to view this kinja-labs.com embed.. Left-hand grip puts power button under index finger, and mute switch under thumb, but volume rocker is a stretch.. The metal does make the phone nearly half an ounce heavier (at 6.17 ounces) and it’s nearly half a millimeter thicker (at 9.85mm) but I didn’t find myself minding one bit. It’s also a millimeter shorter in both directions, and I actually think it may improve the ergonomics. The One was a bit wide for my tastes; the 2 fits easier into my hand.. I do kind of miss the metal lip that gave the OnePlus One a distinct look even from the front, but the 2 still keeps the same spirit with a chamfered metal edge beneath its Gorilla Glass. Depending on the size of your hand, it might still add a little bit of grip.. Some OnePlus One and OnePlus 2 sandwiches. But glass and metal is only half the story when it comes to tactile delight. The rest comes in the form of the OnePlus’s optional $27 rear covers, which use actual wood (bamboo, rosewood, black apricot) or Kevlar for a really awesome look and feel. Even stock, the OnePlus 2’s “sandstone black” rear cover feels pretty good (and definitely far grippier and grittier than the one on the original phone) but real Kevlar or bamboo is where it’s at.. I do hope the final units won’t make it as hard to pry off the rear cover, though: I chipped off a bit of fingernail trying to do so today.. I’ve gotta say the Kevlar’s my favorite so far, but I could actually see myself buying more than one and swapping ‘em out after a while. It’s a level of personalization we’ve never really seen in a smartphone before: even with the Moto X , which let you color-coordinate your phone when you bought it direct from the factory, you’d be forever stuck with your choices.. The screen is pretty much always the most important part of a smartphone. I don’t need to tell you this, because you’re probably reading this article by swiping on a smartphone screen right now. And the original OnePlus One’s screen was, how-do-we-say, not particularly wonderful. I vividly remember taking pictures side by side with the Xiaomi Mi Note and the OnePlus One a few months back—two phones with the exact same Sony camera sensor—and wondering why the pictures seemed so much worse on the OnePlus. It turned out that it was actually just the screen, which looked washed out.. Well, the 1080p LCD screen on the OnePlus 2 is bright and beautiful by comparison. The company claims it reaches 600 nits of brightness, more than the iPhone 6 Plus. Personally, I don’t think it’s anywhere near as gorgeous as the 2K OLED screens you’ll find on a Samsung Galaxy S6 or as glassy and smooth as some of Apple’s displays—I can definitely see rows of pixels if I look close—but for a $330 phone it’s outrageously good.. And speaking of the camera, it’s way the heck better as well. While I definitely didn’t get to take enough shots to tell how it stacks up against an iPhone 6 Plus, Galaxy S6, LG G4 or Lumia 1020— the smartphone camera elite —the OnePlus 2’s new 13-megapixel Omnivision sensor is perhaps the clearest evidence yet that megapixels mean nothing. Same number of megapixels as the previous phone, but WAY better images right out of the box.. Here are a couple of 100% crops from the OnePlus One and OnePlus 2 in good light. Just look how much less noise and how much more detail you see in the image on the right.. And impressively, the image from the OnePlus 2 was half the filesize. Have to say the OnePlus 2 pic is lacking a bit of contrast, though. The darker regions look super dull and grey.. Here are a couple pics showing off the improved dynamic range, likely thanks to the larger pixels in the camera sensor:. Just look how much more you can see in the bright and dark regions of the image. (You might have to click the magnifying glass and download the picture to zoom in.). Sadly, the camera doesn’t have any manual controls or RAW image support, though OnePlus says both are coming in a future update.. So if this phone is so great, why don’t you go ahead and order it on August 11th, the day the phone comes out? Particularly since—like the last OnePlus phone—it’s invite only, the company has limited stock, and there’s no guarantee how quickly they’ll make more?. Well, there are the usual review caveats. We haven’t even tried to make a phone call with it, let alone use apps for longer than a few minutes. (They seemed to run smoothly, but isn’t that true of all new phones these days?) We haven’t tried to take a lot of pictures in challenging environments, and we have no idea if the (slightly larger 3300mAh battery) will still put up a fight given the new processor and bright new screen. The new fingerprint reader felt awesome and quick and accepted my fingerprint from any angle, but who can say whether it’ll be reliable in a pinch without more testing?. Also: though it sure looks like it, this phone doesn’t actually use stock Android 5.1 Lollipop, and isn’t guaranteed to get new updates quickly. Instead, it uses OxygenOS, a customized version that allows for pretty cool tweaks like drawing a symbol on the screen to turn on the flashlight even when the screen is off, or connecting to a new wifi network right from the notification tray, and that cool three-position mute switch that can let you mute everything, nothing, or just allow notifications from your primary contacts to come through.. But without more testing, it’s hard to say whether the OS is stable and whether it’s really, truly better than the pure Google version.. And the number one: if you’re on Verizon or Sprint, you can’t use this phone at all. It’s got LTE that’s compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile, but no CDMA for the other big networks.. It’s got an awesome futureproof new USB Type-C port for charging, but that means none of your micro-USB cables will work. You’ll need new ones ($5 each for OnePlus’s cool new reversible cable, which is admittedly a pretty good deal.). Also, if you want to pay only $330 for this phone, you’ll have to wait even longer: as of August 11th, only the $390 model with 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM will be on sale.. If I’m being a good, unbiased journalist, I’d say wait for the reviews. But personally, I have to wonder if it’s time to leave Verizon and give it a go myself. After the OnePlus One, the Nexus 5 and the Sony Z3 Compact , I’m tired of missing out on great unlocked Android phones.. The Walking Dead returns with the same old lines.

The OnePlus 2 offers unbeatable unlocked smartphone value, delivering top-end performance and features at a fraction of the cost of competitors—as long as you can get an invite to buy one.. The OnePlus 2 is every bit the "flagship killer" the rogue smartphone manufacturer promises, packed with the latest in mobile tech at an unbelievably low price of $389 for the 64GB model. much-maligned invite-only retail model remains, but that unconventional approach helps profit margins, so few competitors can deliver a. is a better value than high-end unlocked phones. like the ZTE Axon Pro. and easily outclasses budget-friendly options like the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3. It's our new Editors' Choice for unlocked smartphones, offering unparalleled value and performance in a spectacular complete package. You just have to be lucky enough to get an invitation to buy one.. Alcatel One Touch Idol 3 (Unlocked). Design, Features, and Network Performance OnePlus doesn't stray too far from its inaugural effort, the OnePlus One , focusing instead on subtle refinements and tight execution. The wonderfully textured sandstone finish helps assuage any plastic prejudices, while the new rigid metal frame exudes quality.. At 5.98 by 2.95 by 0.39 inches and 6.17 ounces, the OnePlus 2. on the large side by conventional standards—much bigger. than the Samsung Galaxy S6. (5.65 by 2.78 by 0.27 inches, 4.87 ounces) and only a hair smaller than the ZTE Axon Pro (6.06 by 2.9 by 0.37 inches, 6.3 ounces). Pleasantly stiff Power and Volume buttons line the right edge, while a dedicated alert slider on the left edge mutes notifications. Along the bottom edge is a new USB Type-C port, which offers a number of advantages to micro USB like faster speeds and reversible design. The back plate peels off to reveal the dual SIM card slot and sealed battery, and OnePlus sells swappable backs in exotic materials like rosewood and. View All 6 Photos in Gallery. The 5.5-inch, full HD LCD might not wow the spec obsessed, but the display nearly matches the S6's blinding maximum brightness, while colors and whites look cleaner and true to life. Contrast is excellent, as are viewing angles. Below the display is a combination Home button and fingerprint reader flanked by programmable capacitive navigation buttons. The Home button is also capacitive, rather than physical, and OnePlus also lets you opt for on-screen software navigation buttons instead, if you'd prefer.. Sold completely unlocked, the OnePlus supports a wide range of wireless spectrum. In the U.S., it'll work on AT&T and T-Mobile with full support for 4G LTE on both carriers. I tested with an AT&T SIM, which worked without any additional configuration. in my tests, putting the OnePlus One's. The earpiece is punchy and offers solid dynamic range with no distortion at maximum volume. Callers' voices sound full and intelligible, while transmissions through the mic were equally clean with natural tone. Noise cancellation works well for moderate indoor distractions, but the OnePlus 2 still let through a good amount of noise from a busy city street in testing. The speakerphone pumps out loud volume, but it sounds. supports 802.11b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi on the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, as well as Bluetooth 4.1 and GPS. In side-by-side tests, the OnePlus 2 was able to keep pace with the Galaxy S6 in Wi-Fi speed, notching an impressive 115Mbps peak download rate to the S6's 118Mbps. Upload speeds lagged behind the S6, hovering around 6Mbps to the S6's 10Mbps average.. Performance and Android The original OnePlus One was notable for being among the first affordable unlocked phones to use a high-end Qualcomm chip. That tradition continues in the OnePlus 2 and its Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 SoC, which is clocked at a slightly lower 1.8GHz to the ZTE Axon's 2GHz Snapdragon 810. The phone gets noticeably warm at times, but not uncomfortably so. Benchmarks were right in line with phones like the Axon or the LG G4 , and numbers didn't dip after running intensive games like GTA: San Andreas for an hour. If you opt for the 64GB model, you also get 4GB RAM, versus 3GB for the 16GB model ($329). strong multitasking chops, which allowed me to jump between resource-heavy games or apps without losing my place or reloading during testing. I noticed a few bugs during my testing period, including intermittent lag between app launches and some random, but infrequent, Home button unresponsiveness.. OnePlus parted ways with the CyanogenMod team that handled the software for OnePlus One. The OnePlus 2 runs Android 5.1 with OnePlus' OxygenOS tweaks on top. Thankfully, OxygenOS is very close to stock Android with only a handful of thoughtful, unobtrusive additions. Gestures like double-tap to wake and drawing a circle to open the camera are easily toggled on or off. You can also opt for software navigation buttons or just swap the Back and Recent Apps functions on the capacitive buttons. The most visible addition is the optional Shelf home screen feature. The Shelf is an adaptive screen that shows your frequently used apps and contacts, as well as a space for widgets. I don't find it all that useful, though, and it can easily be disabled.. See How We Test Cell Phones. Our 64GB test unit came with 53.01GB available out of the box. Bloatware is essentially non-existent here: the only two preloads are an audio tuning app and SwiftKey's popular keyboard replacement.. In a battery rundown test, where we streamed a YouTube video over LTE with screen brightness set to max, the OnePlus 2 lasted 5 hours, 19 minutes. That handily beats the Alcatel One Touch Idol 3's 4 hours and 12 minutes in the same test.. 13-megapixel, rear-facing camera with optical image stabilization. The 1/2.6-inch OmniVision image sensor is the same physical size as the Sony IMX240 image sensor featured on the Galaxy S6. Image quality was very good in my tests, with well-balanced, detail-rich shots in bright outdoor light. Most high-end smartphones take great looking photos in good light, though, and the real test is low-light performance. Under low indoor lighting, the OnePlus 2 was still able to eke out some nice detail and good looking images, but results weren't quite up to the same level as the S6. Image noise isn't overwhelming, but the OnePlus 2's shots showed more grain and smudged details, which could be a sign of overaggressive noise reduction. For example, lettering on labels or books was. more legible on the S6's shots. Color accuracy is a strength here, though, as everything looked more true to life than Samsung's often over-saturated renditions. Focus and capture speed lag aren't nearly on the same level as the S6's camera, which can make capturing action in low light with the OnePlus 2 tough. Video quality tops out at 4K, but footage looks slightly jarring due to lower frame rates. Full HD video quality is excellent and right in line with the Galaxy S6's output.. The original OnePlus One was almost too good to be true—in fact, supply shortages along the way made us wonder if the company ever intended to sell many units in the first place. Now with a year under its belt to work out the kinks, we're ready to put a little faith back into OnePlus and its ability to actually get phones into customers' hands. The OnePlus 2 retains the power, polish, and aggressive pricing of its predecessor, making it the unlocked phone to beat and our Editors' Choice. It's a more refined, less expensive alternative to the ZTE Axon Pro, and far more feature-rich than the Alcatel One Touch Idol 3, our other two top picks for unlocked smartphones.. Bottom Line: The OnePlus 2 offers unbeatable unlocked smartphone value, delivering top-end performance and features at a fraction of the cost of competitors—as long as you can get an invite to buy one..

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. There's no doubt that OnePlus has managed to gather. a significant amount of press over the launch. of its 'difficult second album' in the form of the OnePlus 2. The specifications are as high as expected, and the price is also lower than the competition, thanks to a business model built around razor-thin margins. There's certainly an appetite for the handset, with OnePlus recently reporting over a million consumers have requested an invite to join the queue to buy the smartphone.. damaged the chances of the OnePlus 2 by highlighting. a third OnePlus handset that will be available by the end of the year?. OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei and the OnePlus 2. It is hard to escape the conclusion that Pei has ' Osborned ' the OnePlus 2 with the early announcement of the next handset. The Osborne 1 home computer was released in 1981, but sales crashed in 1983 when founder Adam Osborne announced that the Osborne Executive and the Osborne Vixen were far more powerful computers. retailers and customers cancelled their orders for the Osborne 1. the Executive and Vixen nowhere near ready to go to market, Osborne declared bankruptcy later that year on the strength of. Arguably Sega's eagerness to push the Sega Dreamcast depressed sales of the Sega Saturn, and Nokia's announcement of a move to Windows Phone. saw Symbian sales fall away in the ten months before the first Microsoft-powered handset was available in limited numbers.. There's no doubt that promoting a third handset. when all the efforts should be on the second handset fits the definition.. OnePlus is in a slightly different situation that. could see the company avoid the full force of the Osborne Effect.. gathered significant interest from those looking to buy a new smartphone, and the press generated by this statement is building up the brand-name of OnePlus across the world. For a small Shenzhen-based manufacturer who's last handset sold around 1.5 million units, that's an impressive piece of social media jujitsu.. if the Osborne effect were to hit, OnePlus would not be left with warehouses full of unsold stock tying up financial resources waiting to be sold.. revealed in April , and OnePlus spoke of a 'low-end model' that would target a different. Anyone who does wait for the announcement and sees a weaker model will either be happy to have waited and go ahead with the purchase, or move back into the queue for a OnePlus 2.. The hardcore fans of OnePlus will be paying close attention to all of. these details, will be aware that there will be more handsets this year, that the third handset is. pitched towards the lower end of the market, and that competition for. invites to buy the OnePlus 2 is high.. asked the OnePlus team this morning if they had any concerns.. really excited about the OnePlus 2," a spokesperson told me. "We currently have over 2,200,000 people registered on our reservation list, and the number keeps growing.". Is the third OnePlus model exhibiting the. Osborne Effect? In the classic sense, yes it is, but. OnePlus' business model guarantees them more buyers than handsets.
