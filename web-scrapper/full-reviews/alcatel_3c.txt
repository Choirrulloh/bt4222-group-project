The device has been launched in Italy with a price tag of â¬130 (around $160). It will likely make its way to other European markets shortly, where it should be priced similarly..

Home Phones TCL Alcatel 3C may arrive as the cheapest 18:9 handset. By Marco Lancaster -. The 18:9 displays can be considered as one of 2017’s big surprise. Since it suddenly appeared and become a hell of trend with many brands pushing their smartphones with the newest aspect ratio. Approximately two years ago we weren’t talking about the possible arrival of a 18:9 screen in a phone, but about the crescent amount of resolution being delivered by the manufacturers each year.. LG debuted the concept with their LG G6 earlier in 2017, a few months later Samsung released the Galaxy S8 and S8+ with the 18:5:9 aspect which translates basically in the same thing. After just a few months, what we expected to be present only in flagships expanded to the mid-range class with the likes of Huawei, Gionee, Vivo and even smaller Chinese brands like Bluboo and Maze entering in the party.. Apparently TCL is about to expand the 18:9 screen availability to the entry-grade in at least one of its device under the Alcatel sub-brand. The Alcatel 3C is a phone scheduled to arrive in the first months of 2018, sporting the 18:9 ratio while being priced at a low rate, considering the specifications.. The Alcatel 3C will sport a 6-inch IPS display with a 1440x720p resolution. The processing power is ensured by the MT8321 Quad-core of 1.3Ghz and the old-timer Mali 400 GPU, coupled with only 1GB RAM and 16GB of expandable storage.. Camera wise the handset brings a single 8MP AF sensor interpolated to 13MP, for the selfie enthusiasts there is a 5MP camera interpolated to 8MP.. The Camera interpolation was something very common around some smaller Chinese manufacturers a couple of years ago, but its something rare to see nowadays, apparently the Alcatel 3C will bring back the memories of a day when the amount of Mega-Pixel was more important than the overall quality.. UMIDIGI Z2 to Feature the Fastest Wireless Charging Tech at 15W. Some nice inclusions are a 3,000mAh battery, Fingerprint Sensor and a Triple-Tray that allow the simultaneously use of Dual SIM and microSD. The two downsides of this handset is the lack of LTE connectivity and the amount of RAM. The Alcatel 3C is expected to hit the shores before the end of Q1 2018 and will sell in Europe with a expected price of 130 Euros.. TAGS 18:9 18:9 aspect ratio 3G phone alcatel Alcatel 3C TCL.

New press render leaks show off the upcoming Alcatel 3C. Alcatel is almost definitely a company that you don’t think about when it comes to picking up a new smartphone, even for those of you budget-minded Android fans. However, it seems that Alcatel is working on a new lineup of devices named the “Alcatel 3C”, which is expected to sit in the budget market, and a new series of press renders have leaked showing off the device.. These renders show a rather glimmery backing, along with a display that features an aspect ratio of 18:9. The renders also reveal that the Alcatel 3C will feature just a single rear-facing camera with an LED flash and fingerprint scanner orientated below.. As for specs, we are expecting this 6-inch display to feature an HD+ resolution, while being powered by the MediaTek MT8321 chipset. This MediaTek SoC will be coupled with just 1GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage.. The front of the device will feature a 5MP selfie camera, and the rear shooter will feature an 8MP sensor. Finally, the Alcatel 3C will feature a 3,000mAh battery and will run Android Nougat out of the box, all for just $120. There is no mention as to when this device will be updated to Android Oreo ..

After showing a lot of promise but failing to deliver in terms of smartphone sales volume and profits last year, TCL kicked 2018 off with a long overdue BlackBerry Motion expansion and a fairly interesting CES preview of a “re-imagined” Alcatel product portfolio .. The upcoming Alcatel 5, 3 and 1 Series are supposed to share a premium “universal design language” and a number of “flagship style features”, regardless of the difference in retail pricing.. Oddly enough, while this extensive family of 2:1 devices with relatively thin bezels was expected to be fully detailed at MWC late next month, the spec sheets and MSRPs of two middling models seem to have already made their way to the public.. The Alcatel 3v, which was actually on display in Las Vegas last week without a complete list of features in tow, has been thoroughly leaked as an overall respectable 6-incher with Full HD+ IPS resolution (2160 x 1080 pixels), dual 16 + 2MP rear-facing camera setup, and single 8MP selfie shooter.. The quad-core MediaTek MT6737 processor under the hood isn’t exactly a screamer, and the 2/16GB RAM/ROM arrangement also doesn’t feel quite up to 2018 mid-range standards. But the 3v will apparently squeeze a decent 3000mAh battery into a very good-looking package measuring 8.05mm in thickness and weighing 169 grams. With a rear-mounted fingerprint reader, as well as dual SIM, microSD, Bluetooth 4.2 and Cat. 4 LTE support, this should deliver adequate bang for around 179 Euro on the old continent.. Meanwhile, the lower-end Alcatel 3c is reported as official and up for grabs in Italy, priced at € 130, with a 6-inch HD+ (1440 x 720) IPS screen, fingerprint recognition, 16GB internal storage, just 1GB RAM, single 8 and 5MP rear and front cameras, 3000mAh battery, and dual SIM connectivity.. That’s… pretty terrible, in all honesty, and it makes you think how bad things can get for the entry-level Alcatel 1x..
