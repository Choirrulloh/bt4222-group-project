Samsung Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) and new Galaxy J5 Prime leak. Samsung Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) at Geekbench. Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime (2017) at GFXBench. Samsung marked a record-high profit in Q3 2017 due to the increased interest in mid-tier and entry-level devices. In order to respond to the market trends, Samsung is preparing two new phones, that just appeared in benchmark listings - the Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) and the Galaxy J5 Prime (2017). And thats not all - the first phone even appeared on Samsung South Africa official website.. The Galaxy J2 Pros chipset as reported by Geekbench is Snapdragon 430 with quad-core CPU, clocked at 1.4 GHz. Memory is 1345 MB which might be 2 GB RAM but is more likely to be just 1.5 GB. The OS is, unsurprisingly for an affordable device, the one-year-old Android Nougat 7.1.1.. The phone with model number SM-J250F also popped up in South Africa in dual SIM variation. It was quickly taken down, but at least it confirms the dual SIM version.. GFXBench proved itself leak-worthy one more time. A phone with model name G571 ran the benchmark. We tend to believe this is the J5 Prime (2017) since last years model name was G570. It should come with 4.8 display with HD resolution and Samsungs in-house Exynos 7570 chipset. RAM is most likely to be 3 GB with 32 GB storage. The Galaxy J5 Prime (2017) appears to have 12 MP main camera and 8 MP front snapper, both shooting video in FullHD resolution.. We are yet to hear more from Samsung about launch and availability.. Source 1  Source 2  Source 3. Samsung SM-J337 Galaxy J3 (2018) hits GFXBench with new chipset. New Samsung Galaxy J2 variant spotted in benchmark listings. Dual-camera Samsung Galaxy J7+ and budget J7 Core quietly start selling in the Philippines. Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro now available for purchase in India. I do not know if there is a need to have a new Galaxy J2 (even the need to have a Galaxy J3 is already a bit questionable, but ...), but it will be interesting to see a Galaxy J2 really new than the mistake that Samsung made in India by relaunching t.... If Samsung is planning a new J5 Prime (which, if the number of SM-G571 model suggest, looks more like a 2016 model's Value Edition that apparatus 2018 effectively), should probably be planning a new J7 Prime (one SM-G620?)..

Budget? Find the best phone for you. Picking out the best phone to buy is tougher than ever these days.

Just above the display is a 5 MP camera with a dedicated flash, and around back we find an 8 MP shooter that can film 1080p video.

But honestly, at this price point, you have to make some sacrifices. Luckily, the phone has a 2,600 mAh battery, which Samsung says will give users 60 hours of audio playback.

Samsung’s midrange answer to phones like the Redmi 4, has some surprisingly nifty features.

The new Galaxy J2 Pro’s most notable feature was far. and away the aforementioned Smart Glow, but the new model appears to do away with it in favor of a smaller, less conspicuous flash module.

The new J2 Pro appears to sport the series’ signature plastic chassis, home button, and removable back panel, but leaves a lot to be desired in the specs department. It seems to lack a fingerprint sensor and a 3.5mm headphone jack, and the bottom port looks to be a micro USB, not USB Type-C like most recent Samsung phones. It’s reportedly powered by a Snapdragon processor (likely Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 430, if last year’s J2 is any indication) paired with 2GB of RAM, and in terms of software, 91mobiles expects it to ship with Android Nougat and Samsung’s Grace UI skin.. If the J2 Pro’s shortcomings aren’t enough to dissuade you, it won’t be long before you can pick one up.

Samsung Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) silently introduced with entry-level specs. by Cosmin Vasile. Tags :. Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. It's true that most of our attention is focused on the newest technological achievements announced at CES (Consumers Electronics Show) 2018, but that's no reason not to report on what's happening outside the trade fair. The previously rumored Samsung Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) has just been spotted on the company's official website, which means the budget-friendly smartphone is ready for prime time. The Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) will be available for purchase for around $145 in three colors: Black, Blue, and Gold. It will be introduced in select emerging markets starting this week, but it might go global later on. Specs-wise, this is an entry-level smartphone powered by Android 7.0 Nougat. It comes with a 5-inch Super AMOLED display with qHD (540 x 960 pixels) resolution and a 1.4GHz quad-core, paired with 1.5GB RAM and 16GB expandable storage. There's a decent 8-megapixel camera on the back and a secondary 5-megapixel selfie camera in the front. The Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) is powered by a 2,600 mAh battery and features dual-SIM, as well as LTE support. Although the Galaxy J2 Pro (2018)'s specs are far from being impressive, it does offer decent specs for the price you pay. source: Samsung Vietnam via Playfuldroid.

Samsung Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) To Be Available Worldwide. December 7, 2017 - Written By Dominik Bosnjak. Samsung ‘s Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) that’s been heavily leaked in recent times will be available on a worldwide level, SamMobile reported Thursday, citing a list of the phone’s country-specific firmware builds. While the sole existence of the software doesn’t necessarily translate to guaranteed availability in a related country, the latest leak is understood to be largely accurate in terms of revealing the markets in which the company’s next entry-level offering will go on sale, even though it’s unlikely to have a global launch and is instead expected to gradually expand its availability over the course of the next year.. In terms of high-priority markets, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam are believed to be among the first markets to receive the Galaxy J2 Pro (2018). The smartphone won’t launch in Samsung’s home country of South Korea and also won’t be available in China where the company’s market share has been on a sharp decline in recent times as the phone maker found itself unable to compete with aggressively priced offerings from local original equipment manufacturers, as suggested by recent reports. The device is also expected to be a Carphone Warehouse exclusive in the United Kingdom, whereas other European countries set to receive it are Germany, Poland, and Ukraine. More markets on the Old Continent may eventually see the launch of the Galaxy J2 Pro (2018), albeit they aren’t posed to receive units with localized firmware, as indicated by the new leak. The same source suggests Samsung won’t be targeting either North or South America with its upcoming entry-level Android handset, though it’s still expected to launch at least several devices covering this particular price range on the two continents over the course of 2018..

The handset is alleged to be sold in Russia and the majority of Asia, as well as most African countries. No firm availability windows have yet been provided by insiders, though the Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) is likely to be officially introduced early next year and release in all of Samsung’s target markets in spring. Galaxy J2 Pro (2016) should cost around €160 ($190), depending on the region and one’s wireless carrier or phone retailer of choice.. Android 8.0 Oreo To Reach ZenFone 4 By The End Of This Month.

Samsung Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) manual leaks online: Is the launch nearing?. Published: Saturday, December 9, 2017, 14:15 [IST]. Earlier this month, we came across the leaked renders of the Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) and a 360-degree video of these renders. The renders also shed light on the design that we can expect to see on the upcoming smartphone.. Now, the official user manual of the smartphone that was uploaded online on Samsung website has been leaked by a Romanian website via SamMobile. The manual does not shed light on a lot of details but it does confirm that the smartphone will be similar to the Galaxy J series smartphones those were launched this year. We say so as the device appears to sport a plastic body with a removable back cover and battery.. The manual of the Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) shows that the smartphone might arrive with the new Samsung Experience UX based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat. Notably, the latest version of Samsung Experience was already seen in the Galaxy Note 8. However, the leaked manual does not confirm what the device will be called officially. Though Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) is what the speculations suggest, we can expect Galaxy J2 Pro (2017) too as it was circulating in rumor mills for some time. But by the time it goes on sale, only the Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) moniker will make sense.. It goes without saying that the Galaxy J2 Pro will be an entry-level smartphone with a quad-core Snapdragon 430 SoC or its Exynos equivalent based on the market. The device is said to feature 1.5GB RAM and dual SIM capability as well.. Given that the alleged manual of the Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) has been leaked online, we can expect the smartphone to be launched sometime soon. So we might not have to wait for long for a long time..

How will I know if my SAMSUNG Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) is locked? To find out if your phone is locked, simply place a different SIM card in the phone and turn the phone on. Ensure you use a different SIM and not the SIM that the phone was supplied with. If the phone does not allow you to make calls and displays an error message such as ‘SIM not valid’, ‘Phone Restricted’, ‘SIM not accepted’ or it’s asking you to enter an unlock code then your phone is most likely to be locked. How do you unlock my SAMSUNG Galaxy J2 Pro (2018)? You provide us with easy to find details of your phone e.g. the type, the IMEI number, country and the network that supplied the phone. This information is then used to provide an unlock code to unlock your phone. You simply follow the instructions we provide, and the phone will be unlocked – easy!. What information do I need to give you? This varies depending on the phone. Typically you need to provide the model, the 15 digit IMEI number of the phone and the country / network it is locked to. Usually this is enough but this does vary for each handset and solution. Either way we provide you with full easy to follow instructions to unlock your phone. Do I need the original SIM card to unlock my SAMSUNG Galaxy J2 Pro (2018)? The unlock codes we supply for most handsets will be entered without any SIM card inserted. However, certain handsets do require either an alternative SIM card, or the original SIM card to be inserted in order for the unlock codes to work. Do I require technical knowledge? None at all, we provide complete and easy instructions for unlocking your phone. Often it can be as simple as entering an unlock code using the phone’s keypad. If there is a problem unlocking your phone using the codes we provide then we will endeavor to solve the problem to the best of our ability. What do I do with the unlock codes? Once you receive the codes, follow our detailed instructions and enter the codes into your phone by using the phone keypad. It is simple and straight forward and will immediately unlock your phone. Can I get a discount if I have more than 10 phones to unlock? Sure. Please contact us through our website we offer special discounts for professional unlockers. What is a SIM card? It’s the small (roughly 2cm by 1 cm) microchip card that you insert into a phone when it’s first set up. It provides the identity of the phone for the mobile network. The SIM card is usually located behind the battery on the back of the phone. How do I pay? We accept a wide range of payment methods : – Visa – Mastercard – American Express – Electron – Paypal – Others…. Is it safe and secure entering my card details on your website? Your cards details are fully encrypted and processed over a secure server. We do not store your card details for maximum security. We also support PayPal, which has a Thawte certified 128bit SSL Security site. Will my phone still work? Yes, unlocking simply removes the network lock and SIM lock that are entered into the phones software when sold to you by the network. Will the unlock codes damage my phone? Removing the network restriction on your mobile phone with unlock codes is the safest form of unlocking available. You simply enter the necessary codes directly into your phone via the keypad to remove the network restriction. Unlocking a SAMSUNG Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) phone is easy as making a call..

Samsung Galaxy J2 Pro 2018 Leaked In New 360-Degree Render. By Ken Manbert Salcedo On 12/05/17 AT 4:47 AM. Samsung might be focusing more on high-end and mid-range smartphones, but the company isn’t completely abandoning its more affordable low-end handsets. A new leak has revealed that the South Korean phone maker will be releasing the new 2018 version of the Galaxy J2 Pro.. The 2018 Galaxy J2 Pro was first revealed by Steve Hemmerstoffer (@OnLeaks) on Twitter with a CAD render of the handset. The leaker also collaborated with 91Mobiles to bring a 360-degree video of the upcoming budget Android smartphone.. The 2018 Galaxy J2 Pro will be the successor to the 2016 J2 Pro.. The 2016 version of the handset features an LED ring around the rear-facing camera and it allowed users to take photos with the “Smart Glow” feature. For the 2018 Galaxy J2 Pro, it looks like Samsung has decided to ditch the ring-shaped LED light for a. smaller and quite traditional LED flash.. As for the overall design, the 2018 Galaxy J2 Pro pretty much looks like Samsung’s most recent mid-range handsets. Since it’s a budget Android smartphone, the handset doesn’t have an Infinity Display or a “bezel-less” design. Instead, the handset will have the classic smartphone design with thick bezels and a plastic body. One advantage of having a plastic body is that the 2018 Galaxy J2 Pro will have a removable back panel. This will likely mean that it will have a removable battery. It still has a front-mounted fingerprint scanner, which doubles as a physical button at the bottom of the screen.. As for ports, the 2018 J2 Pro still has. a micrUSB port on the bottom and the 3.5mm headphone jack on top. The power button is located on the right side, while the left will have the volume buttons. The dimensions of the phone are roughly 143.1 x 72.2 x 8.6mm. There’s no confirmation yet on the device’s exact screen size, but it will likely have a 5-inch display.. As for internal specs, the new Samsung Galaxy J2 Pro. 2018 will feature Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 430 quad-core processor clocked at 1.4GHz, which will be accompanied by 2GB of RAM. The device is expected to be a dual-SIM Android smartphone and will run Samsung’s custom skin on top of Android Nougat.. There’s no information yet on an exact release date. It might be announced this year or sometime early next year. It’s very likely that this phone will officially be released in Asia, Latin America or Europe. However, it could also arrive in the United States at some point, albeit through unofficial means, as pointed out by Phone Arena. Pricing for the 2018 Galaxy J2 Pro is expected to be under US$150.. Aside from the new Galaxy J2 Pro, specs for the 2017 Galaxy J5 Prime have. The new J5 Prime will have a 5-inch IPS LCD display, with an Exynos 7570 chipset, 3GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, according to GSM Arena. Like the J2 Pro, the new J5 Prime will feature a front-mounted fingerprint scanner and the typical Samsung smartphone design. It will also have 13MP camera, an 8MP front-facing camera, a 2,500 mAh non-removable battery and will run Android 7.1.1 Nougat. The new J5 Prime will likely be released in select markets before the end of 2017.. Samsung's 2018 Galaxy J2 Pro revealed in newly leaked CAD render.

Samsung discreetly unveils Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) and Galaxy On7 Prime phones. Adrian Diaconescu January 9, 2018 1:25 pm. You probably didn’t stay up many nights dreaming about the ultra-low-end Galaxy J2 (2018) after that massive leak last month. But if you’re inexplicably interested in 2018 in plasticky 5-inchers running Android 7.0 Nougat, sporting qHD screen resolution and packing 1.5GB RAM, you should be happy to see the entry-level handset officially announced at last.. Also known as the Samsung Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) or just J2 Pro, the retro-looking smartphone is obviously not powerful or special enough to make a CES 2018 appearance in Las Vegas.. Instead, the chaebol’s Vietnamese website simply started listing the modest product sometime this week with absolutely no fanfare or advance notice, revealing the regional price point as the rough equivalent of $130 (VND 3,290,000).. To clarify, you’re getting a qHD AMOLED display here, not a QHD unit, with a terribly outdated 960 x 540 pixel count, alongside an unnamed quad-core 1.4 GHz processor, 8MP rear-facing camera, 5MP selfie shooter, 16GB internal storage, and 2,600 mAh battery.. Meanwhile, over in India, a local Amazon-exclusive Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime was also unveiled without much pomp, despite seemingly offering pretty respectable specs. We’re talking 3 or 4GB RAM, paired with 32 or 64GB storage space, as well as octa-core Exynos 7870 processing power, 13MP front and rear cameras, 5.5-inch Full HD display resolution, a full metal unibody construction, Samsung Pay Mini support, and 3300 mAh battery.. The price tag is unfortunately unspecified, as is the actual release date of the Galaxy On7 Prime, although Amazon will be sure to notify you when sales kick off if you want to register your interest.

Adrian has had an insatiable passion for writing since he was in school and found himself writing philosophical essays about the meaning of life and the differences between light and dark beer. Later, he realized this was pretty much his only marketable skill, so he first created a personal blog (in Romanian) and then discovered his true calling, which is writing about all things tech (in English)..
