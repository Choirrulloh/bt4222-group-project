Please ask the question in above box. Which mobile is best Samsung on 8 or Moto G4 plus?. G4 Plus is any day better considering the specifications and the price. I personally haven't used G4 Plus, but have read and heard good reviews about it. Both phones are good, however, on8 has removable battery, G4 plus doesn't! If thats not your major concern, you may go for G4 plus. But, if you are a Samsung fan, then go for on8 or j7 prime. Honestly, I am a heavy user and wyt over 150 apps installed on my phone, my on8 gives me a battery backup of only 4-5 hrs. I previously used j7(2015) wyt almost same number of apps, but never gave me any such problems. The phone however doesn't hang or lags, even wyt so many apps installed!. Before you buy any of the phones, please consider checking. if you ask mote g4 and Samsung my suggestion is go with Samsung on 8, perfect look and nice user interface. For basic users on8 is best and for gaming go for G4.. Both are best at their place but I am using on8.. resolution of display of mto g4 is better. Does it have good camera quality than J7?. On8 and j7 have pretty much the same camera. I have used both for over 6months now. The rear camera of on8 gives slightly more saturated and vibrant pictures than j7, while j7 gives a bit natural looking pictures. One major difference btwn both the cameras is that while in video recording mode wyt rear camera, you can easily zoom in and out while recording wyt on8, whereas this feature is not available in j7 (but might be there in j7 prime). So the on8 camera is good for videos as well. However, before you buy any phone, do check this out https://goo.gl/BLSVXr. The On8 can do HDR, whereas the J7 can't, and the front camera is also better under low-light conditions.. Camera and display sharpness are to good in on 8. How is the resolution of the phone?. OK actually the question is little bit elaborating as clearly, you are not mentioning screen resolution or camera!!. First on the screen behalf I can clearly and profoundly said the best 1080p full HD panel provided by Samsung. Also, you can play with colour balance in four modes provided by Samsung.. Now camera resolution rear one has 13mp, in good light captures reasonably good image, colours are punchier and vibrant but in artificial somewhat noise levels are high as don't have ois. Front cam with flash took good photos reasonably. So overall if you are Samsung fan go with it, otherwise moto g4 plus and redmi note 3 or lenovo k6 power. Also you can wait for Redmi note 4 until jan 19th.. Resolution of phone is just mind blowing..Its has Full HD super amoled screen.. It's best in quality, you can record full HD video of 1080p.. This phone has a super amoled display which is the best.. Which phone is better Samsung On8 or Lenovo K6 Note?. Currently, I am the owner of On8, both are little less than average. Still, On8 has a hanging problem, and the screen quality is not that great. Performance is fine, and the battery is really good. Also, if you have really made up your mind to choose between these two, then go for On8.. Samsung On8 is best compared to any other mobile at this price.. Samsung on 8, it's display and picture quality is very good.. My opinion is Samsung Galaxy On8.. Which one is best Samsung Galaxy On8 or Redmi 4 64GB?. If you want better display and camera quality, then go for Samsung. Other than that Redmi 4 is best. It has good battery backup and fast processor. Camera and display is good, but not like the Samsung. I use Samsung j7, it is slow downs if you use lots of apps, but Redmi does not.. I am the owner of On8, and my dad has Redmi 3. You get a lot of add-ons on Redmi 3. The cameras of both phones are fine but sound and battery wise Redmi have an Edge.. I think Galaxy On8 is better than Redmi 4. Redmi 4 has lot of features but not as good as Galaxy On8.. Redmi 4 is the best choice.. User Reviews of Samsung Galaxy On8. 14 Ratings 1 Reviews. 5 9. 4 2. 3 1. 2 0. 1 2.

The dual-SIM handset boasts 32 GB of base storage that can be expanded via microSD (up to 256 GB), and runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. Elsewhere, the Galaxy On8 includes a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera with LED flash, f/1.9 aperture and 1080p video capture. There's a 5-megapixel snapper on the front for selfies.. OS: Android (6.0), Samsung TouchWiz UI. Dimensions: 5.97 x 2.99 x 0.31 inches (151.7 x 76.0 x 7.8 mm). Weight: 5.96 oz (169 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus, CMOS image sensor. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Octa-core, 1600 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 17.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 5, 7.

Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 27 Sep 2016. Shopping information MSRP price: $ 240. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Good, sturdy phone!. I don't have the necessary wherewithal to give a detailed technical review. I use mobile phones primarily for answering calls, WhatsApp, checking mails, online shopping apps and casual browsing. The following is a review based on that experience: Pros: 1. With the kind of usage listed above, it lasts for two days quite easily. Touch functions are smooth and there's no lag. Apps work fine without a hitch. Call volume is good and alarm and reminder functions work smoothly. It's not bad but for those who consider it important it will be a disappointment. All in all, it does everything a smart phone is supposed to do competently and without hassle. Those who use their phones for similar functions as I have listed above, you can do much worse than this. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Heating problem.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Good, sturdy phone!. I don't have the necessary wherewithal to give a detailed technical review. I use mobile phones primarily for answering calls, WhatsApp, checking mails, online shopping apps and casual browsing. The following is a review based on that experience: Pros: 1. With the kind of usage listed above, it lasts for two days quite easily. Touch functions are smooth and there's no lag. Apps work fine without a hitch. Call volume is good and alarm and reminder functions work smoothly. It's not bad but for those who consider it important it will be a disappointment. All in all, it does everything a smart phone is supposed to do competently and without hassle. Those who use their phones for similar functions as I have listed above, you can do much worse than this. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Heating problem.

Samsung Galaxy On8 unveiled with 5.5" Super AMOLED display. Samsung has really been working hard on expanding and updating its product lineup lately. The focus seems to be mostly on the company's newer families, with new additions like the Galaxy C9 on the horizon and now a brand new release within the "On" branch.. The On8 was just announced today in India. It comes at a quite dynamic time for the budget series, with the Galaxy On7 (2016) now official and the On5 (2016) coming shortly. Notice the lack of a (2016) in the product name? This is due to the fact that there is no On8 from last year to build upon, making this a truly fresh offer.. The Samsung Galaxy On8 comes with a 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display - a clear upgrade over the LCD variety on its siblings. This news falls in line perfectly with a recent Flipkart post and is great news for Samsung AMOLED fans, looking to pick up a punchy panel on the cheap. Putting two and two together, that also means that the display is FullHD.. Powering the phone is an undisclosed octa-core SoC. Judging from the quoted 1.6GHz clock rate, this might actually be Samsung's own Exynos 7870 Octa - the same 14nm chip that can be credited for the Galaxy J7 (2016) 's amazing battery life.. Other specs include 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable on-board storage. The camera setup consists of a 13MP, f/1.9 main snapper and a 5MP selfie one. Last, but not least, there is also 4G VoLTE support. This is all packed into a body measuring 151.7x76x7.8mm and weighing in at 169 grams. The power comes courtesy of a 3300 mAh battery.. Currently the Galaxy On8 appears to be an India exclusive, set to go on sale on Flipkart from October 2, just in time for the "Big Billion Day Sale".. To further prove its India roots, the Galaxy On8 also features two "Make for India" initiatives - UDS (ultra data saving) and S bike. As already mentioned, you can get the phone on Flipkart, starting October 2 in Gold, Black or White for INR 15990 ($240).. Samsung CEO on foldable Galaxy X: We're ensuring it's no gimmick. You can now pre-book a Galaxy S9 or S9+ in India. Here's the first TV ad for the Samsung Galaxy S9. Galaxy S9 and S9+ pre-orders start in Canada as well. Did you get a reply for this one?.

Author Vigneshwar SR Posted on November 14, 2016 November 23, 2016 Categories Android , Reviews , Samsung. Samsung Galaxy On8 smartphone in Golden color. Dual SIM slots with 4G LTE support. Following the launch of Galaxy On5 and Galaxy On7 , the South Korean giant Samsung launched its successor dubbed as Galaxy On8 at a price of Rs. 15,900 in Black and Gold colors exclusively on Flipkart. This mid-ranger comes packed with 5.5-inch Full HD Super AMOLED display, Octa-core Exynos 7580 processor, 3GB RAM, 13MP/5MP camera package. 15,900, is the Galaxy On8 worth buying? Let’s check out.. Earlier we unboxed the Samsung Galaxy On8. Rectifying its past mistake, Samsung has finally offered a Full HD Super AMOLED display for Galaxy On8 with 5.5-inch (1920 x 1080 pixels) in size translating into a pixel density of 401ppi.. Compared to its predecessor On7 with TFT display, the Galaxy On8 jumps comfortably to the next level with pretty impressive screen contributing a good color reproduction, sharpness, viewing angles and an above average sunlight readability. Being equipped with Super AMOLED display, the power consumption will be quite efficient.. The display does attract fingerprints leaving smudges on screen sometimes, even though it shouldn’t be a big issue.. Moreover, you can choose any one among the four screen modes — Adaptive display, AMOLED cinema, AMOLED photo, and Basic. To give a heads-up, the ‘Adaptive display’ optimizes the color range, saturation, and sharpness automatically according to your environment.. The AMOLED Photo Mode is tailored for the content from premium digital cameras, as most of these use the Adobe RGB color gamut, while the AMOLED Cinema Mode is made for watching movies with the best possible color gamut.. The Basic mode uses the standard color gamut which is currently used for producing every consumer content including films, TV, apps, games and much more.. Considering all this, the Galaxy On8 manages to get thumbs up at this very price point. However, there is no information about the presence of Corning Gorilla Glass.. While Samsung aces in design language on higher end smartphones, the mid-ranger rarely proves to be good. Talking about the form factor, the device measures 76×151.7×7.8mm thick and weigh around 169 grams, which is again a slight difference from its predecessor.. Moving on to the design, the Galaxy On8 is a doppelganger of Galaxy J7 with very few changes. This 5.5-inch smartphone fits perfectly in hand and isn’t slippery either, offering a nice grip when holding. Moreover, the company has replaced the leather back cover with a polycarbonate material with a smooth matte finish which looks and feels good.. The sides of Galaxy On8 has a shiny chrome rim running around with round corners seen in Galaxy J7 previously. On the front top, there is a 5MP front camera with a f/1.9 aperture along with LED flash for low-light selfies. proximity sensor, ambient sensor next to ear piece. that the smartphone lacks notification light, which is present in almost all mid-range. Samsung continues to go with its traditional just below the display with metal lining around it. Further, it has two capacitive buttons as well on both the sides without backlit support.. The volume rockers are placed on the left, while the power button is on the right. Further, the USB port, 3.5mm audio jack, and primary microphones are placed on the bottom of the device with a slightly visible antenna bands.. While there is nothing on the top, it has 13MP camera setup, single LED flash and a not-so-effective speaker grill on the back. The Samsung Galaxy On8 do come with a removable battery, with two dedicated SIM slot and microSD card slot inside the back cover.. On the whole, the build quality and design language is definitely an improvement over its predecessor. The Samsung Galaxy On8 comes Black, Gold and White colors.. Talking about the software, the Galaxy On8 is shipped with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box with its own UI on top. The lock screen shows the times and lets you launch dialer and camera too. The drop down notification bar has several toggle options, a brightness slider and an option to change the SIM card.. In default, it doesn’t have any extra theme, but you can purchase it through Theme store. Moreover, it has Smart Manager app that lets you manage your device on battery life, storage, RAM usage, and security all in one place. Out of 3GB RAM, you will get around 1.3GB free when all the default app is running in the background.. The highlighted feature of On8 is the Ultra data saving mode, where it compresses cellular data across all contents such as videos, photos, media, almost all apps and websites and S Bike mode, where if someone makes a call to your number, he/she gets a voice message saying the caller is riding the bike.. Since Motion lock is enabled by S Bike Mode, you cannot answer the call unless you stop the bike or ride it less than 10kms/hr.. Speaking of bloatware, the Samsung Galaxy On8 comes with pre-installed with Google, Microsoft office apps, and other native utility apps as well. Moreover, it doesn’t have any game and a dedicated music player as well. In this case, we opted Google Play for listening to music.. All things considered, the audio output on speaker turns out to be poor, yet the sound through headphones are decent. Even there are chances of missing out call in a very noisy environment unless if you choose vibration. This device does come with FM radio with a very simple interface.. On the ROM, out of 16GB, the user will get around 13.1GB storage. If you need more storage, you can also add microSD card up to. The Samsung Galaxy On8 supports connectivity options including 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS and NFC. Nowadays, dual SIM slots are mandatory in the mid-ranger and Galaxy On8 neatly ticks the box here. It also has VoLTE (voice-over-LTE) support for Reliance Jio.. Both the SIM slots support 4G LTE and dual standby mode, which in turn allows us to take calls from second SIM even if you are on a call from first SIM. It also has USB on-the-go (OTG) support so that you can connect OTG drives easily. In addition, we also tested the call reception and was pretty satisfied with the experience we got.. The Octa-Core Exynos 7580 processor clocked at 1.6GHz combined with 3GB RAM provides a butter smooth performance without any noticeable lag or hang. The Samsung Galaxy On8 is definitely fast enough for daily usage and multitasking applications. At this price range, the phone has enough power to offer sufficient performance in the everyday task.. In 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited, the Samsung Galaxy On8 placed itself at the bottom of the chart with a score of 8175.. In Antutu Benchmark 6, the Galaxy On8 scored around 42571.. It scored 916 points in the Basemark OS II benchmark.. The Samsung Galaxy On8 scored 3699 at the Geekbench Multi-Core test.. The Samsung Galaxy On8 scored 714 at Geekbench 3 Single-core test.. The Samsung Galaxy On8 is powered by a 3300mAh battery without any quick charging technology. With average usage including calls, browsing Wi-Fi, video calls the smartphone is good for one full day.. It also comes with Ultra power saver mode, which saves juices by applying a greyscale theme to your home screen and limiting the number of usable apps. Also, you can replace the battery very easily as it comes with the removable battery options.. In our battery test the Galaxy On8 achieved a One Charge Rating of 13 hours and 44 minutes, better than the Galaxy On7 that scored. a One Charge Rating of 12 hours and 42 minutes. Check out the complete set of battery life test results here .. The Samsung Galaxy On8 comes with 13MP rear camera with f/1.9 aperture, and 5MP front camera with single LED flash on both sides.. The user interface of the camera is the app is simple without any complications and similar to other Samsung smartphones.. It comes with varieties of options including — mode (Auto, Pro, Panorama, Continuous shot HDR (Rich tone), Night, Beauty face, sports and sound shots), effects negative, sepia, grayscale), timer, picture size, and settings.. This smartphone lets you launch the camera app by just pressing the home button twice and use the volume rockers as a camera shutter. To our surprise, the day light shots and macro shots are impressive with fine amount of details and sharpness. The 5MP front camera also proves to be good under perfect day light conditions.. But when it comes to low light, the noises are almost present in all areas with loss of details. When turned on the flash under low light, the detailing of subject is decent without light over powering it.. On the whole, the Samsung Galaxy On8 is definitely an improvement over it predecessor On7 with few refinements that doesn’t go above and beyond. Even though it doesn’t have creative ingredients, it does fares in most of the part when it comes to the mid-range segment.. The Galaxy On8 definitely benefits from the design, display, and front facing LED flash which is the most noticeable feature here. Lack of fingerprint sensor, notification LED, and other such options make us turn our head away from Galaxy On8. To sum it up, the Samsung Galaxy On8 is a pretty neat package at Rs. 15,990, until you take a look at other alternatives/rivals..
