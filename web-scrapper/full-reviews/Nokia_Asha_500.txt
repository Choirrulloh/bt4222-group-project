Displaying review(s) 1- 3 of 3 Sort by: Most Helpful Most Recent. one of the best nokia phones in its price range!!. By Sharique Azim | 2 May 2014. Its is worth for its price,while nokia never fails to deliver and perform.i was not a big fan of nokia until recently(i.e last feb) when i bought this phone.touch response is atmost par to other capacitive touchscreen phones,while being a little sluggish at times.build and design wise this gets 4/5.the UI is somewhat good ,though something that did not impress me was fast lane.. Contacts and calling are though a little pain ,where nokia might bring in some improvements.it supports whatsapp,line,we chat etc.. 3g is not but wifi supported as mentioned. Camera:nokia makes exxeptional camera phones.the clarity of the picture is fine at 2mp camera,ehich is 10 times better than other cameras with higher resolutions.low light images are bad due to no flash.but the picture can be zoomed without any fades.. Battery life is around 2 days on moderate use.. except for 64 mb low internal memory you would love this phone.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 2 out of 2 people found this review helpful. By Praful Yadav | 5 May 2014. I never knew that such a durable yet trendy phone will be available at such an affordable price. Last month I bought a mobile phone for my mom on her birthday and as she is not much into Smartphones and Tablets, I thought about gifting her something stylish yet simply to use. I told the same to the sales girl at the Nokia Store and she took out a shining red coloured Nokia Asha 500. I liked the phone at the very first glance and bought it immediately.. The phone looks great and it’s durable too. My mom told me that she feels absolutely light to carry it and it is even very comfortable to use. She is a working lady and so she needs to do most of her work through emails. She now finds emailing easier with the Nokia Xpress Browser which makes the internet browsing faster. The Fastlane is a feature which is exclusively available on this device. It keeps all the recent activities of my mom in one single screen and she can jump to any of them with a single swipe. Social apps like Whatsapp, WeChat and Line is also available on the phone, though my mom isn’t really interested in them. I need a mobile phone for myself and I am thinking about buying this one. It won’t really burn a hole in my pocket and will solve my purpose as well.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 2 out of 3 people found this review helpful. By Sanjay Choudhury | 5 Oct 2015. Nokia Asha 500!! This phone is weird. It places calls automatically even when the phone is locked by password, picks up the last dialed number and then calls in a burst! Triggers five to six calls within few seconds. Happens while the phone is in my trouser pocket, during a particular time of the day. Wonder if the phone is hacked! I have tried everything. Placed password to restrict the touch access. It is causing me severe social embarrassment.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. Nokia Asha touch phones receiving software update for MixRadio and more.

It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED.

Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed.

The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be.

Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time 14.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time 22.0 days (528 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

Especially for you as a proud owner of the Nokia Asha 500 we have written this post. WWe investigated the ability to download and install WhatsApp for this particular device.. The Nokia Asha 500 was launcehd in October 2013. A period where Android and iOS were not so dominant as they are right now. Times have changed rapidly and Android and iOS have gained considerable ground. The Nokia Asha 40 software is already being used for years. It is one of the first operating systems that was used for the more sophisticated phones. Now we will furtger zoom in on the features which relate to WhatsApp for Nokia Asha 500. Indeed, this device is already several years old and this is also reflected in the screen. Yet, the 2.8 inches, 240 x 320 pixels is reasonably. It is bright and sharp, photos and videos are displayed well. Every phone needs some internal storage. For example for apps like WhatsApp and for any kind of media. The Nokia Asha 500 offers an impressive capacity of 64 MB ROM. This is sufficient for the storage of your most important data.. Did you know you can increase the previously mentioned internal memory with 32 GB (4GB included)? That is expanded with an SD-card. This is not always standard included with your phone when you buy it. On board of this phone we can find a 64 MB RAM RAM chip that ensures sufficient memory. A good camera is useful when you share a lot of photos via social media like Twitter or WhatsApp. This phone offers a 2 MP, 1600 x 1200 pixels camera. This is absolutely not the newest camera, but it is sufficient for the average user.The Nokia Asha 500 has a nice and long battery life because it offers the exclusive Li-Ion 1200 mAh battery (BL-4U). Very convenient if you are on the go and you can’t charge while you are traveling. Maybe you didn’t know that this device also offers nice features like SMS(threaded view), MMS, Email, IM, MIDP 2.1, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, MP3 ringtones, 320p@13fps video.. Tough, convenient and helpful when you are a big user of apps like Facebook and WhatsApp.. Now you are stuck with the question, can I download WhatsApp for Nokia Asha 500? We provide the answer on this question in the following review. When you want to download WhatsApp on recently launched phones you will notice that this will go much easier that on it goes on this smartphone.. 4.3 (85.56%) 223 votes. Download WhatsApp for the Nokia Asha 500. Should i do this and is it even possible?. Check here the best review of WhatsApp Download for Nokia Asha 500.. WhatsApp is a comprehensive application that requires a lot of performance capacities of a phone. It is not obvious that everything just works smoothly.WhatsApp has a number of minimum requirements. In this review we actually analyse the extent to which the Nokia Asha 500 fits to these requirements.. More info about the firmware version and year of release Before October 2013 nobody ever had heard about this device. That changed significantly once this phone was introduced to the market. The first days of sale were very successful. WhatsApp works best on Android, iOS and Windows Phone. This device runs on Nokia Asha 40 which makes it impossible to download the app.. Let's take a look at the memory, the display and the RAM chip of this device. The display of the Nokia Asha 500 has a resolution of 2.8 inches, 240 x 320 pixels. That is clear and bright enough for reading messages. It is nice to mention that this phone offers an internal storage of no less than 64 MB ROM. To be honest, that is quite a lot for such an old phone. It might even be sufficient for the WhatsApp App. But before you can download WhatsApp, you need a more recent Operating System. Do you need more space? But you don't want to buy a new smartphone? Than you could decide to buy a SD Card and extend your capacity with a maximum of 32 GB (4GB included). Great to store photos, videos or music. The 64 MB RAM Ram memory chip is not that good and persuasive. Our conclusion is: slow, unreliable in larger processes, and certainly not suitable for the use of bigger and complex applications. The 2 MP, 1600 x 1200 pixels camera generally offers many advantages for editing photos and videos. However, if we use the camera on the Nokia Asha 500, the results are quite disappointing.. If you want to know more specs and details of other phone you can read our reviews about. About the durability of the battery and other specifications A powerful battery is what the new smartphones are missing very often. This device still has an old-fashioned Li-Ion 1200 mAh battery (BL-4U) maintains for a relatively long period. Did you know that this phone has also access to options like SMS(threaded view), MMS, Email, IM, MIDP 2.1, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, MP3 ringtones, 320p@13fps video.? Unfortunately no WhatsApp support, but a lot of other cool features that make this phone a lot more attractive.. The final judgment >br>WhatsApp presents a number of requirements for each phone. The Nokia Asha 500 performs quite well. Sufficient memory and enough internal storage. Unfortunately, the software is too old for a safe WhatsApp download.

The Nokia Asha series was a range of low-end feature phones produced and marketed by Nokia. The name "Asha" comes from the Hindi word meaning "hope". On 3 September 2013, Microsoft announced its purchase of Nokia's mobile device business, with the deal closing on 25 April 2014. The company previously announced an intent to use Asha as an "on-ramp" to the Windows Phone platform, [2] [3] but in a company memo released in July 2014, it was announced that as part of cutbacks, Microsoft would end the Asha and Android -based Nokia X range entirely, in favor of solely producing Lumia Windows Phones and Nokia-branded "feature phone" products. [4] On 11th January 2018, HMD Global acquired the Asha brand name. 1 List of devices. 2 Nokia Xpress Browser. 3 Asha on Linux project. Below are the mobile phones in the Asha range. None of the Asha models have GPS functionality. All Asha phones include an FM radio .. The Asha 305 and Asha 311 models are known as the first generation of Asha Full Touch phones; the second generation is the Asha 50 x line. All devices up to the Asha 50 x series run the Nokia domestic operating system with Series 40 UI platform, also known as S40. The Asha 501 (released in May 2013), Asha 500, Asha 502, Asha 503 and Asha 230 (announced on 14 February 2014) are powered by the Nokia Asha platform , which builds on S40 and Smarterphone. Nokia 206, 207, 208, and 301 are not part of the Asha series as they do not carry the "Asha" branding, despite mistakenly being marketed as such by carriers and retailers.. Nokia Xpress Browser uses intermediate Nokia proxy servers to optimize web pages based on the capabilities and screen size of the device. The proxy servers also compress data to reduce data transmission charges for the mobile user. Like the Opera Mini , the Nokia Xpress browser decrypts and compresses HTTPS traffic, routing it through Nokia's own servers. [28] This practice seeks to provide faster browsing for users of feature phones and smartphones with lower processing power and thus lower bills for mobile data usage. [29] However, as pointed out by researcher, this raises serious privacy concerns, because Nokia is essentially "performing Man In The Middle Attack for sensitive HTTPS traffic" and temporarily decrypting user data—which could be sensitive financial information, passwords. [30] The company admitted to the technical details, but stated, "Claims that we would access complete unencrypted information are inaccurate". [31] GigaOm criticized Nokia, which, unlike the Opera Mini, has failed to make it clear that HTTPS traffic will be decrypted during transit. It recommended that Nokia learn from Amazon's Silk browser, which leaves HTTPS traffic undisturbed. See also: Nokia X and Lumia_series §. According to The Verge , Nokia had a project referred to as Asha on Linux and also as "MView"—a reference to Mountain View. The project used a fork of Android on a low-end handset to maximize margins. The project resulted in the Nokia X family of devices, unveiled at MWC 2014. It was one of two known Android projects at the company, the other was running the OS on high-end Lumia hardware.

Hands-on with the Nokia Asha 500, 502 and 503. Nokia adds 500, 502 and 503 to its Asha lineup, starts at $69. Hands-on with the Nokia Asha 500, 502 and 503. The Abu Dhabi spotlight might be set squarely on the new Lumia devices, but the Windows tablet and pair of Windows Phones amounted to only half of the products Nokia announced today. A trio of Asha handsets also made the trip to the desert: the 500, 502 and 503. These three devices, which essentially are slightly revamped versions of the Asha 501 released this spring, will likely get the most facetime in emerging markets thanks to their smartphone-like features and reasonable price. The 500 -- the least expensive of the three -- is slated to cost $69 SIM-free, which is a solid $30 less than the 501; on the more expensive end of the pricing spectrum is the 503, which is $99 and comes with quad-band GSM plus dual-band HSPA. (The 501 offered EDGE speeds for the same price, so this is a nice step up.). On the outside, the new Ashas don't look that much different than the 501, with one giant exception: all three now feature a box-like layer of transparent polycarbonate surrounding the standard colored casing. This is a pretty fresh design technique we haven't seen much of before; this extra layer prevents wear and tear on the regular casing, and keeps it from losing its color over time. That said, some of the demo units already had some scratches on the transparent casing, so only time will tell how durable the retail units will be. Anyhow, because of this design, you can expect the new Ashas to be a bit bulkier than its predecessor, but this likely won't come as too much of a distraction to anyone because of its petite size..

Even though Whatsapp has been available for Asha phones for awhile now, Nokia highlighted the app at the event, noting that there are over 350 million active Whatsapp users around the globe. It proudly claimed that Whatsapp registers 250,000 users everyday through Nokia handsets, though it wouldn't break down users per platform. Nokia also announced that the social feature on Fastlane, Asha's list-like view of recent activity, is now customizable. For 501 users who might feel a little left out, don't fret, as these features will be available to you via an over-the-air update as well.. Back to the new hardware, it was revealed that the 500 has a 2.8-inch screen and a 2-megapixel camera, while both the 502 and the 503 have 3-inch screens and 5-megapixel cameras with LED flash. The 503 is clearly the best of the bunch, as it also has Gorilla Glass 2 and 3G connectivity. All three have WLAN, quad-band EDGE and boasts one month of battery standby time. They're all available with dual SIM capabilities, though the 500 and the 503 also come in a single SIM variant. The 500, 502 and 503 are priced at $69, $89 and $99 respectively. Availability is set for around Q4 of this year. They'll all be for sale in Africa, APAC, Europe and the Middle East, while the 500 and the 503 will be available in Latin America as well..

The Nokia 500 is an entry level Symbian Belle smartphone. It was first released on 1 August 2011, with all models available by the end of the year. It comes upgraded to Nokia Belle after 15 February 2012 onwards (previously known as "Symbian Belle") via Nokia Suite and over-the-air (some country variants) The Nokia 500 has had many problems since it was first released with firmware version 010.029, but it runs smoothly after the 11.33 update. Instead of an OpenGL ES GPU, the 500 features a simpler OpenVG GPU, so, even though 3D apps work without hardware acceleration, some 2D and vector apps, like Angry Birds , work correctly. [2] The "Nokia Belle" update (latest software release is version 111.021.0028) improved performance with less latency and a new interface.. The Nokia 500 comes with pre-loaded Angry Birds app. Belle features up to four home screens with live widgets in different sizes. Home screens can be personalised with home screen widgets and shortcuts, including notifications and connectivity options. The lock screen can be customised with wallpapers and important information.
