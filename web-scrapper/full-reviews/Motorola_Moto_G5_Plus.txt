Doesn't lag or hang (so far) but the camera is disappointing. Phones that cost less than Moto G5 Plus have a better camera. So do u think the Honor 9 Lite's camera is better than the G5 Pus?.

The Moto G5 Plus sets a new standard for affordable unlocked phones with a premium build, solid specs, smooth performance, and bloatware-free Android software.. The Motorola Moto G5 Plus ($299 as tested) is the successor to last year's G4 Plus , but the two phones couldn't be more different. Gone is the cheap plastic build, the so-so camera, and the middling performance that dragged down the previous model. It's been replaced by a sleek metal design with buttery smooth performance, a capable camera, and great battery life. It also runs a bloatware-free version of Android, and has bands to work across all major US carriers. It sets a new standard for what you can get in this price range, and easily earns our Editors' Choice award.. The Moto G5 Plus is available unlocked in two configurations: 2GB RAM/32GB storage for $229 and 4GB RAM/64GB storage for $299. Special versions of the phone are also available to Amazon Prime members at $185 for the 2GB/32GB storage model, and $239 for the 4GB RAM/64GB storage model. These are the same exact phones, but they have ads from Amazon on the lock screen, similar to a Kindle.. The G5 Plus has a sleek metal unibody build available in Fine Gold (pictured here) and Lunar Gray. The smooth finish is accented by shiny chamfers along the edges and gently rounded corners. It's easy to mistake the phone for a much more costly device.. The phone is noticeably smaller than its predeccesor, at 5.9 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and 5.5 ounces. Its smooth edges also make it a lot more comfortable to hold than the sharp angles of the LeEco Le S3 (6.0 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches, 5.4 ounces).. There is a rather large bezel, though, especially above and below the display, so using it with one hand can be a challenge. That said, a One-Handed mode can be activated to shrink the phone's display so everything is easier to reach. You can also activate a Split Screen mode when the Recents menu is open by dragging and dropping an app into the top section of the screen. It's a handy tool for multitasking, letting you use two apps at the same time.. View All 7 Photos in Gallery. Along the sides the G5 Plus has all the buttons and ports you'd expect. A volume rocker and ridged power button are on the right. The bottom is home to a 3.5mm headphone jack and a micro USB charging port. The top has a SIM/microSD card slot. Motorola says the microSD slot works with cards up to 128GB, but we were able to use a 256GB card without any trouble.. The phone is covered in a water-repellant coating, so it should be fine in the rain and with the occasional splash, but you shouldn't submerge it in water. That's not a huge downside, as there aren't many fully waterproof phones in this price range aside from the niche Kyocera DuraForce Pro .. The G5 Plus has a 5.2-inch, 1,920-by-1,080 IPS LCD clad in Gorilla Glass 3. The resolution works out to a crisp 424 pixels per inch (ppi). It's the same resolution as the 5.5-inch Honor 6X , but the Quad HD panel on the ZTE Axon 7 (538ppi) packs in more pixels. It's still more than sharp enough for the size, with clean text and images. Color reproduction is good, with more accurate colors than the Honor 6X, though you don't get the inky blacks produced by the Axon 7's AMOLED panel. Viewing angles are also good, but screen brightness leaves something to be desired. The panel doesn't get as bright as the one on the Honor 6X, and it's hard to see under direct sunlight.. The G5 Plus supports Active Display, which gives you access to battery status, date, music controls, notifications, and time when the screen is otherwise off. It's similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7 , but rather than always being on, it only turns on when you pick up the phone and look at it. That helps save battery life, but it also means you can't quickly glance at it when the phone is sitting on your desk unless you nudge it.. See How We Test Cell Phones. Below the screen is a fast and responsive fingerprint sensor, but it's also much more than that. Once set up with your fingerprint, you can enable One Button Navigation through the included Moto app. This lets you remove the on-screen navigation buttons and interact with the phone entirely through swiping the sensor, giving you more screen real estate to work with.. Swiping to the left takes you back and swiping right brings up Recents. Touching the sensor once unlocks the phone, touching it after that takes you to to the home screen, and holding it brings up Google Assistant. It only took me a couple of minutes to get used to, and I found it to be an intuitive way to interact with the phone. I also preferred it to the on-screen buttons because you don't have to move your thumb as much. It's an innovative implementation I'd like to see on more phones in the future.. Users of previous Motorola phones will also find all the familiar gestures still work. You can twist the phone to launch the camera app (or press the home button twice), pick it up to stop it from ringing, flip it facedown to silence notifications, and so on.. The G5 Plus supports CDMA (850, 850+, 1900MHz), GSM (850, 900, 1800, 1900MHz), UMTS (850, 900, 1700, 1900, 2100MHz), and LTE (1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/13/17/25/26/38/41/66) bands. It lets the phone work on all major US carriers, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. We tested it on T-Mobile in midtown Manhattan, where we recorded decent network performance with a high of 6.4Mbps up and 2.5Mbps down. It's not as high as we've seen on other phones tested on T-Mobile's network, but that's likely due to network congestion.. Other connectivity protocols include dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz and 5GHz) and Bluetooth 4.2. There's no NFC though, which means you can't use Android Pay. If that's important to you, you'll have to pay more for the Axon 7 .. Transmissions tend to be a bit muddy in noisy environments, but come across clearly when indoors. Noise cancellation is good enough to blot out most traffic noise, but wind often breaks through. One oddity worth noting is that the earpiece doubles as a speaker. As you might imagine, that makes for a rather loud earpiece, but a tinny speaker.. The G5 Plus is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor clocked at 2.0GHz. It's a solid chipset, scoring 63,845 on the AnTuTu benchmark, which measures overall system performance. That's a better score than Kirin 655-powered Honor 6X (56,602), though it falls behind the Le S3 (82,564) and the Axon 7 (141,989), both of which have more powerful Snapdragon processor.. But benchmarks are only part of the story. When it comes to real-world performance, the G5 Plus feels buttery smooth, thanks to the combination 4GB RAM and a lightweight Android skin. The phone handled everything we threw at it, launching apps, multitasking, and playing advanced games without a hitch. That said, we do recommend choosing the higher 4GB RAM/64GB storage model, as 2GB of RAM just isn't enough anymore if you want truly smooth performance.. The phone clocked 7 hours, 35 minutes in our battery rundown test, in which we stream full-screen video over LTE at maximum brightness. That's longer than both the Honor 6X (5 hours, 35 minutes) and the the Axon 7 (6 hours). With the included TurboPower adapter, the phone's 3,000mAh battery can charge to 100 percent in 1 hour, 30 minutes.. The phone has a 12-megapixel rear camera that takes solid shots. Naturally, it does best in well-lit settings, taking clear pictures with a good amount of detail. Overall, colors are brighter and sharpness is a bit better than the Honor 6X, at the expense of some noise. The G5's camera app is also faster and more responsive.. The Honor 6X takes slightly clearer, sharper pictures in low light, but both phones have manual controls so you can fiddle around with the settings. By adjusting aperture, white balance, focus, and ISO, I was able to get the G5's indoor shots up to snuff.. The 5-megapixel front-facing camera takes fairly good pictures in most circumstances. It's more than capable for selfies and video chat, though things can get a litle washed out outdoors.. The G5 Plus also has the ability to record 4K video at 30fps. Recorded video is crisp, and more stable than the what the 1080p Honor 6X can muster.. The G5 Plus ships running Android 7.0 Nougat. While it's not quite as recent as the version of Android 7.1 running on the Google Pixels, there aren't many phones in this price range running even remotely current software. Motorola has a pretty good track record with updates, so hopefully we'll see Android O on the G5 Plus in the future.. This is stock Android, which is certainly a plus. And aside from the included Moto app (which lets you configure Active Display and gesture settings), there's no bloatware to speak of. Since there's no bloatware, you have plenty of free internal storage: 53.71GB on the 64GB model. You can also always toss in a microSD card and format it as internal storage if you want more space for apps and games.. If you're looking for a great phone that won't break the bank, the Motorola Moto G5 Plus checks all the boxes. It has a premium metal build, a sharp display, long battery life, a solid good camera, up-to-date software, and some pretty cool unique features. Whether you pay $185 for the Amazon Prime version, or $300 for the fully loaded model reviewed here, you get more bang for your buck than the $250 Honor 6X. Yes, the Axon 7 has a faster processor and a higher-resolution display, but it also costs more and you can't use it on Sprint or Verizon. So if you're shopping for a new phone and $300 (or even $200) is the top of your budget, you can't beat the Moto G5 Plus. That makes it an Editors' Choice.. Bottom Line: The Moto G5 Plus sets a new standard for affordable unlocked phones with a premium build, solid specs, smooth performance, and bloatware-free Android software..

Motorola Moto G5 Plus (64GB, Lunar Gray). CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The splash-resistant Moto G5 Plus has a near stock version of Android Nougat, a good camera and video, and a metal build -- and it's extremely kind to your wallet.. The Bad There's no NFC on the US model, and audio sounds tinny through the built-in speaker.. The Bottom Line With a long list of features you want and only a few that you don't, there is no better budget phone than Motorola's Moto G5 Plus.. Lots of Moto models Moto G5 Plus US and UK models and pricing. The magic touch of one-button navigation Peppy performance across the board Good camera with a dark side. The thing that makes the Motorola Moto G5 Plus ( $209.99 at Walmart ) the best budget phone on the planet is that, for the most part, it doesn't feel like one at all. It looks, feels and operates like a much pricier phone, which means that wallet-watchers are getting a great deal.. This is just Moto continuing its trend of providing more features than other inexpensive Android phones. This year's model improves on last year's Moto G4 Plus with a modern, metal body; more storage; Android 7.0 Nougat; Google Assistant; new Moto gestures; NFC (in the UK model); a really good camera and 4K video: all while remaining delightfully affordable (prices below).. But this generation of the Moto G ( $449.00 at Amazon.com ) family also includes the slightly cheaper Moto G5. Both phones have a similar metal body design, but the G5 has a smaller screen, half the storage and a weaker processor. The G5 isn't offered everywhere, for example it won't be sold in the US. But even if it were, the G5 Plus would be the better value.. The Moto G5 Plus costs $229 (32GB), $299 (64GB) or £249 (32GB), depending on the model. Each model differs slightly when it comes to storage, RAM and NFC. Motorola hasn't yet announced an Australian model, but the US price converts to AU$300 and AU$390.. Since the G5 Plus is a universally unlocked phone , it will work on all major US and UK carriers. It's worth checking compatibility with your carrier if you're unsure. The dual-SIM option on Moto G5 Plus is only available in select regions globally in Latin America, Europe and Asia.. One of my favorite features is the G5 Plus' fingerprint sensor. It's on the front below the display and works as well as Apple's Touch ID on the iPhone. But Motorola did something really cool: it added a handful of shortcut gestures that turn the fingerprint sensor into a mini touchpad, a feature it calls One Button Nav.. Once you turn it on in the Moto app, tapping the fingerprint sensor brings you home. If you swipe left, it shows your recent apps. If you swipe right, it goes back. If you long press, you lock the phone and if you tap and hold, Google Assistant pops up.. It's all quite easy and intuitive and I like that I didn't need to make any extra moves reaching for separate onscreen buttons. In fact, after using the Moto G5 Plus, it was difficult not to instinctively try Moto's shortcuts on other phones.. The Motorola Moto G5 Plus ventures out. The Moto G5 Plus has a 2GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625, which is also inside the Moto Z Play. My review unit had 4GB of RAM (some have 2 or 3GB). The G5 Plus supports both 2.4GHz + 5GHz band Wi-Fi. In use, the phone was fast and responsive. The camera was peppy, playing games like Super Mario Run was smooth, and social media apps like Instagram and Snapchat worked without a hiccup -- even when adding filters.. The battery lasted 13 hours and 22 minutes in our looped video battery drain test: 2 minutes longer than last year's Moto G4 (13 hours 20 minutes) and 1 minute longer than the new, premium LG G6 (13 hours and 21 minutes).. The camera uses a 12-megapixel sensor similar to the one in the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S8 (it's a dual-pixel sensor if you're following along) -- that makes autofocusing fast and accurate. In most situations, I got good sharp photos. But in darker locales, for example inside a bar, the autofocus slowed and I started to see noise in the pics (blurry specks and sprinkles)..

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets, Shutter speed control. Shooting Modes Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Effects. Features Digital image stabilization, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 2000 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

By Vincent Zothankima | 9 Apr 2017. I've been using this phone for about 3 weeks and I'm well convinced its the best phone, with trusted and reputed brand, in this price segment. Camera is awesome(at this price), specially in low light shooting. I don't see how 360 put the camera among the cons, and it really is hard to understand why low light shot was particularly not appreciated. CPU is very efficient and OS is clean and free of bloatware which makes it faster and smoother. And yes, this phone is VOLTE.. Was this review helpful?

I have been using this mobile for a month now I don't have any issues with it it had some microphone issues which were fixed with an OTA update this mobile looks feels and performs like a champ the camera quality of this mobile is just brilliant its ram management is top it looks like a flagship but the only thing which is not good is that camera bump otherwise the mobile is best in class. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful. By Afzal Ashraf | 6 Jun 2017. For a budget range mobile it's perfect, it has everything that you need in a budget range phone. Battery backup is good, it will last for a full day even with 4G data is on. Performance wise it'll not let you down I've compared with redmi note 4, for a milli second its pretty quickerâ than note 4 !!. And BTW camera, both front and back are great, picture quality, image is much more stable than other phone. NFC supported, not a hybrid sim (at a time you can use two sim and memory card), fingerprint is way better and quick response.. The part I'm not satisfied with the phone is speaker, sound quality is low,and at first the bulgy camera seems fashion but eventually if you don't use with a thick back cover it might get scratched so bad.. Overall it's a perfect phone for it's class.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful. By Punit Sharma | 23 Feb 2018. thats a very good cell for me i realy liked it ..good camera ...good processor. Was this review helpful? Yes No. By Small Praveen | 3 Nov 2017. Speaker is good, professional camera not expected but good, stylish and good in performance. Was this review helpful? Yes No. Moto G5 Plus Price Cut in India, Following Moto G5S Plus Launch.

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets, Shutter speed control. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Effects. Features: Digital image stabilization, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 2000 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit.

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

Product Information This Motorola MOTO G5 Plus phone is an unlocked smartphone model that comes in Lunar Grey. It is jam-packed with the latest features, including 64 GB of storage space, an Octa Core processor, a 12.0 megapixel camera, and a 5.2 inch diagonal screen size. The software that is included is Android, with storage for apps and media downloads. The unlocked models allows users a wide choice of carriers.. by tennyball Aug 18, 2017. The phone's great if you're looking for minimally tweaked software, solid battery life, and a decent camera. While the camera isn't "Pixel" quality, it gets the job done. Shots are clear, but fine details and colors can get a little smeared when zooming in. Otherwise, great for the occasional Instagram post or memory shot. Definitely also get a case and screen protector (which should seem like a no-brainer). The screen, while Gorilla Glass 3, still picks up a fair share of scratches when put in a bag, pocket, or fanny pack. It's a solid mid-range phone that just works; no need to worry about it getting you through a day and loading all your apps real quick. Though there is an issue with the camcorder mic; it's dreadfully noisy/picks up a lot of background noise. Headphone output is pretty OK, but don't expect to be tingled if you're an audiophile. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned. by fzdolfan Jan 09, 2018. Phone seems okay except for the fact that the WiFi doesn't work, even after doing all available system updates and multiple resets. The WiFi connects, but is unusable. It's as if it's in a "connected, no internet access" state, except it doesn't say that. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New. by rtg_paintball Dec 06, 2017. Great phone at a great price. The only thing this phone lacks is NFS and micro C connection. Otherwise everything about the Moto G5 Plus is a top end experience. The 64/4 is fast and responsive with 128gb Sd card formatted as internal gives this phone vast storage and system memory. Takes great pictures and 4K video runs smooth casting to my smart TV. In use from 6am to 11 pm and there's still battery life left. The turbo charger has come in handy on mornings I forgot to charge the phone. I have recommended this phone to anyone looking to upgrade.. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned. by pemnetwork Nov 21, 2017. Moto G5 Plus Review (Not G5s Plus). Great phone, great value, good replacement for my Galaxy S4. I use Waze back and forth to work every day, 50 miles, and the battery holds up great using GPS. By the end of the day I still have around 60% battery. I'm not a power user, FB and YouTube now and then throughout the day. The only thing I actually miss is a multi-colored LED that I was able to assign to different text alerts. This phone has no notification LED on the front and I don't like having my personal messages come up on the screen so I don't use that setting. If I'm not at my phone to hear/feel the vibrate alert I have to go into the phone to see if anyone has texted me. I'm not one that is glued to my tech so the LED used to eliminate the need to physically check. I didn't think to check for that before I bought the phone. The colors are not as vibrant as my S4 but I'm not using it for professional photography. The screen colors and brightness are more than adequate. Other than that it is a great phone for the price. If you get one, get the Moto G5s Plus, prices are very close now so bump it up a bit.. PEM, Network Systems Engineer by profession Read full review. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New. by ehilliard Oct 04, 2017. I'm a big Motorola fan, just have been over the years. I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on a phone. It's not like it used to be where so many new features came out every year where a new phone was exciting. It's basically a necessary appliance for most of today, and this does the job really, really well.. The display isn't as good as the high end phones (but saving $500 makes it very good) and I think the radio isn't quite as good/sensitive as I'm with AT&T and it's not great in my house in spots, and in one spot, I struggle to make calls out, where on my Nexus 6, that problem didn't happen as often. Once connected though, haven't experienced a drop.. Strong phone, fast enough to do the things I do (Twitter, OK Google, Read, etc; not much gaming) and saved a bunch of money.

http:/ / www.phonescoop.com/ articles/ article.php? a=18920. The Moto G5 Plus is a mid-range Android smartphone that covers the basics and then some. It represents the company's most refined and powerful G yet. If you're in the market for a visually appealing, unlocked handset that outperforms most others at the same price, the Moto G5 Plus should be at the top of your list. Here is Phone Scoop's full review.. Motorola's fifth-generation Moto G series is the company's most refined and powerful yet. If you're in the market for a mid-range, unlocked handset that outperforms much of the competition, and looks good doing it, the Moto G5 Plus should be at the top of your list.. It's been interesting to watch the Moto G evolve. The phone has remained in the middle of Motorola's lineup for several years, and done a reasonably good job of sticking to its affordable price point while introducing new features with each successive generation. The G5 Plus is surely the most exciting version yet, thanks to its metal chassis, upgraded specs, and great everyday performance.. The G series has used colorful plastic materials since Day One, but Motorola is dropping that design aesthetic in favor of high-end materials. The front is glass and the back is mostly metal. The color selection leans towards the conservative (gray or gold), though chamfered edges along the outer frame give the handset a nice dash of visual appeal. I like the look of the metal finish on the back, which has some grain to it. Some may mourn the loss of the swappable, colorful rear shells that have defined the G series since the beginning, and I wouldn't blame them. The G5 Plus loses some youthful individuality when compared to its predecessors; it feels more mature and less ebullient.. Perhaps the one improvement I appreciate most when compared to the G4 is the reduction in size. Motorola went overboard with last year's 5.5-inch Plus model; the company has thankfully reigned things in with the G5 Plus. The 5.2-inch screen allowed Motorola to keep the dimensions in check. It's not necessarily the most compact phone ever, but it's much more suited to one-handed use and to stuffing into pockets.. I'm pleased with the quality of the G5 Plus. Motorola selected fine glass, resin, and metal for the phone, and assembled all the components tightly. There are no loose parts, no uneven seams, and no cheap-feeling buttons or controls. There's no doubt it's a step up from the G4 and earlier versions of the G series. Everything about the phone speaks of a thoughtful approach to its design and manufacture.. The chamfered edge of the resin frame defines the shape and face of the G5 Plus. Despite the change in materials, the G5 Plus is still immediately identifiable as a Motorola handset thanks to its basic outline. The glass sits below the resin frame a bit, which forms a very thin rim that protects the phone when it is placed face down. The gray model has black glass, while the gold model has a gold bezel around the display. Either way, the earpiece is clearly visible thanks to a metal rim that sits in the glass. The user-facing camera is easy to spot, too.. The front of the G5 Plus includes a fingerprint reader that doubles as a home button and navigation tool for the home screens. The button is indented just a bit from the glass surface, but it feels smooth and comfortable, and is easy to find and use. Swiping left on the home button takes you back, while swiping right activates the app switcher. Motorola did a great job with the outer frame. The smooth curve is comfortable against your skin and it flows well into the back surface. You'll find the screen lock button and volume toggle on the right edge. The screen lock key is positioned about in the middle and has a ridged texture to it. The profile, travel, and feedback are excellent. The volume toggle has a smooth finish to help differentiate it from the screen lock key. It could be longer, but the profile, travel, and feedback are all fine. The SIM/memory card tray is tucked into the top. A paperclip or tool ejects it easily. A 3.5mm stereo headphone jack is on the bottom, as is a microUSB port.. Just a few words about Motorola's decision to go with microUSB rather than USB-C. The company explained to us at Mobile World Congress that most people shopping for phones in this category can't/won't necessarily invest in all new accessories to accommodate USB-C, particularly if they already have lots of microUSB stuff. Of course the sooner all phones and all accessories adopt USB-C, the faster this problem will go away. But I understand Motorola's thinking here. In early 2017, microUSB may, in fact, make the Moto G5 Plus more appealing to some shoppers on a budget.. A metal panel covers the bulk of the rear surface. It's fitted into the resin frame and bookended by plastic pieces that allow radio signals to pass through. I like the overall effect, which is classy. The combination of different colors and textures works. It's impossible to miss the camera module, which strongly resembles those of the Moto Z family. (It can't accept Moto Mods, though.) It's the diameter of about a quarter, and about as thick as two stacked quarters. The stylized Motorola "M" logo is etched into the metal below the camera. You cannot remove the rear panel, and thus cannot access nor remove the battery. That likely annoys a few of you, but it's become par for the course on many of today's handsets, particularly if want a true metal back.. There's no question the Moto G5 Plus a fine piece of hardware, especially considering the price point. It easily puts midrange offerings from LG, ZTE, Huawei, Blu, and others on notice.. The phone's screen measures 5.2 inches across the diagonal with full HD resolution. This is a good combination of size and pixels, making for a sharp display that has smooth text, graphics, and icons throughout. I was very pleased with the resolution. Colors are accurate across the board, and the LCD panel puts out plenty of light. I had no trouble viewing the phone indoors or out. Viewing angles are really excellent for an LCD screen. It's a great display for this class of device.. Motorola is selling the G5 Plus unlocked. It supports the majority of LTE bands used by U.S. carriers (LTE 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 7 / 8 / 12 / 13 / 17 / 25 / 26 / 41 / 66), and even includes CDMA for Sprint and Verizon. It works with AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, and all of these carriers' prepaid brands. I tested it on AT&T and Verizon, and came away impressed.. The phone was always connected to the network no matter where I took it. The G5 Plus was able to make calls under the weakest network conditions, and didn't drop or miss any calls on either AT&T or Verizon's networks. Calls remained connected during lengthy jaunts down the highway, too.. Data speeds were decent on both networks. Certainly the phone delivered punchy performance for everyday activities like checking email, downloading apps, and scrolling through Facebook and Twitter. I didn't run into any unusual problems when streaming music or video content over LTE. The G5 Plus has the 4G goods.. Call quality is a bit on the choppy side. The earpiece can push plenty of air into your ear canal in order to make calls audible in even the noisiest environments. I had no trouble hearing calls in busy coffee shops, bustling diners, or walking around clogged city streets. Volume isn't an issue, but clarity is. With the volume cranked up, the earpiece is prone to a lot of distortion. Clarity is best if you keep the volume set between 40% and 60%, but then calls are harder to hear. People said I sounded "good" via the G5 Plus.. The phone doesn't have a separate speakerphone speaker and instead just cranks up the earpiece to absurd levels. The result is a distorted mess. Moreover, when used as a speakerphone, the earpiece just doesn't deliver enough volume. I wasn't able to hear calls at all in a coffee shop or in a moving car. (I tested voice calls on both AT&T and Verizon's networks. There was no appreciable difference between the two.). Ringers and alerts are jarringly loud. The vibrate alert is strong enough to ensure you won't miss calls as long as the phone is in your pocket.. The G5 Plus' slim frame contains a nice 3,000 mAh battery. Motorola has done a great job in recent years ensuring its phones deliver good battery life and the G5 Plus is right up there with the best. It easily pushes through a full day of heavy use with power to spare. I had no trouble at all getting the G5 Plus to last from breakfast to bedtime. On most days I tested the phone, it had about 20% power left at the end of the day, which was enough to get it throught the night and to mid-morning the following day.. The phone includes only the standard Android battery tool. This can be set to come on automatically, or switched on/off when needed. It reduces processor output, dims the screen, and cuts down notifications. My guess is most people won't need this tool.. The G5 Plus supports rapid charging via the included wall wart. Motorola claims 15 minutes of charge time delivers 6 hours of battery life. That's approximately what I saw during testing.. The G5 Plus offers acceptable Bluetooth functionality. Pairing with other devices via the system menu was easy enough. I connected the G5 Plus to speakers, headphones, PCs, and my car with little effort. Call quality was mediocre when pushed through a dedicated headset, and downright miserable via my car's hands-free system. Music sounded very good through a pair of Bluetooth speakers.. Google Maps made excellent use of the G5's GPS radio. The phone found me in a blink and worked great as a live navigation tool when driving from Point A to Point B.. variant of the G5 Plus doesn't include NFC even though the international version does. Motorola says dropping NFC for U.S. buyers was purely about cutting costs. Top Five Budget Handsets of 2017. Not everyone has the means or the desire to spend $1000 on a smartphone. There's good news: phone makers spent 2017 shoring up their ranks of budget-friendly devices, which now offer an incredible amount of performance for the dollar.. Hands On with the Motorola G5 and G5 Plus. Motorola introduced the Moto G5 and G5 Plus in Barcelona, the latest in its series of mid-range handsets. Motorola says it polled consumers in order to develop the G5 series' feature set, which include metal designs, good cameras, fingerprint readers, and high-definition screens.. Hands On with the Livermorium Keyboard Slider Moto Mod. Motorola's partner Livermorium announced plans to bring its $99 slide-out QWERTY keyboard to market. Is this the accessory or your typing dreams?. Hands On with the Moto X4. Motorola's new iconic phone fills the gap in their lineup between the flagship Z series, and the more affordable G series. Its focus is style and camera.. Motorola's mid-range Moto X4 is a classy glass-and-metal Android handset that boasts two cameras, rapid charging, and advanced software features. The phone is affordable and sold unlocked with support for most U.S.. 4 GB RAM 3,000 mAh battery. Headphone Jack (3.5mm), Fingerprint Reader, Memory Card Slot, Water-Resistant. LI Cellphone User Jul 19, 2017, 5:34. Motorola G5 Plus provides a solid phone with near stock Android. I purchased one with Amazon ads on Prime Day. I have not tried the camera yet, but also have Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge to compare it to. One unique feature is that it has Wifi calling, which combined with T Mobile service gets free calls to the U.S. from a Wifi hotspot almost anywhere in the world..

CNET también está disponible en español.. The Motorola Moto G5 Plus works hard for your money. A shiny metal body, new gestures and 4K video prove the G5 is still the budget phone king.. by March 24, 2017 4:00 AM PDT. The Motorola Moto G5 Plus ventures out. Moto G5 Plus has a metal build and flagship camera. Papa's got a brand new look. Swipe to shrink and other awkward names. It's not the number of megapixels, it's the size. So what's the catch? To Plus or not to Plus. A spec comparison of the Moto G5 Plus, Moto G5, Moto G4 Plus, Huawei Honor 6X and Nokia 6. Words such as "cheap," "affordable," "bargain" and "budget" are often slapped onto products that are good in their own right but still inexpensive. I adore these value products because when I buy one, I feel smart for getting something that works well enough and didn't kill my wallet.. For years, Motorola has been the king of the budget market. The company's Moto G phones offer plenty of features and are wonderfully affordable.. The newest family member is the Motorola G5 Plus, which somehow adds even more premium features. It's got a metal body, more storage, new Moto gestures and even 4K video. All this without raising the cost.. The G5 Plus is $229 (32GB) or $299 (64GB) in the US, and will start at £259 in the UK. Australian details haven't been announced, but the US prices convert to AU$300 and AU$390. If you're an Amazon Prime member you can snag a G5 Plus with lockscreen ads at a $45 discount, making the 32GB model only $185.. So, where's the catch? Are you sitting down? There isn't one.. While I still have a lot more testing to do with the G5 Plus, here are my first impressions so far.. The Moto G4 , G4 Plus and G4 Play were defined by a clean design and a charming plastic back. The G5 Plus trades in the plastic for shiny metal all around and it looks damn good -- like upgrading from a Men's Warehouse suit to a tailored sharkskin suit that fits you perfectly.. The body has a wide fingerprint sensor on the front and is splashproof. Motorola says this protects it against accidental spills, splashes or light rain. However it's "not designed to be submersed in water, or exposed to pressurized water, or other liquids" and "not waterproof.". The Moto G5 Plus rocks a 5.2-inch 1,920x1,080-pixel resolution display. It's sharp and looks nicer than you'd expect for a budget phone. Seriously, my cat pics look sweet.. The G5 Plus comes with either 32GB or 64GB of storage and either 2GB or 4GB of RAM. It has the same 3,000-mAh battery as the G4 Plus and hopefully it'll yield a similar good result when we run our looping video battery drain test .. This is a universally unlocked phone and will work on all major US and UK carriers. But when in doubt, it's always wise to check with a carrier to ensure compatibility.. You can graphically shrink the display to make one-handed use easier.. The Moto G5 Plus runs a close to stock version of Android 7.0 Nougat, though small additions such as navigation gestures and lock screen notifications are welcomed touches.. If you've ever used an iPhone, there's a handy yet horribly-named iOS feature called Reachability which makes the top of the screen easier to reach by graphically sliding the whole thing down. Motorola added something similar to the G5 Plus and it is addictively convenient.. While the name isn't much better than Reachability, Swipe to Shrink lets you use your thumb in a windshield wiper-like motion across the screen to reduce the size to about two-thirds. This makes it easy to reach the top of the screen one-handed. To return the screen back to normal, you just tap in the black area surrounding the miniaturized display.. Another cool software trick is called One Button Nav which turns the G5 Plus' fingerprint sensor into a mini-track pad. A single tap on the sensor, brings you home. Swiping left-to-right opens recent apps, while swiping right-to-left lets you go back.. My favorite Moto trick is an oldie but a goodie: Twist to Quick Capture -- again not the best name. You double twist your wrist to quickly open the camera. I especially enjoy this when I want to quickly take a discreet picture.. The G5 Plus has a fast shooting 12-megapixel rear camera.. The G5 Plus has a 12-megapixel camera. But wait Patrick, didn't the G4 Plus have a 16-megapixel camera? Yes but fewer megapixels isn't necessarily a bad thing. If those pixels are larger, they can result in less noisy images, especially in low light -- a good tradeoff for any minuscule loss of detail that might occur. Apparently this is the same camera sensor found in the Samsung Galaxy S7. In the time I've had the phone, the camera has been quick to focus and handles picture bursts like a pro. Speaking of pro, there's a "Professional Mode" in the camera app, which lets you control everything from white balance to ISO. But that's not even the best thing! The G5 Plus can also record 4K video! That is a truly remarkable addition for a budget phone. Though keep in mind 4K video files are a bit larger than HD video files, so I would definitely recommend taking advantage of the G5 Plus' expandable memory and adding a 128GB microSD card .. The selfie camera has a wide angle lens great for getting those group shots. There's even a beauty mode to turn your skin from Matthew Perry to Katy Perry -- if you're into such things.. The Motorola Moto G5 Plus ventures out. OK, while none of these are a deal breaker for me, there are some things I find annoying. The G5 Plus has NFC and that means you can use Android Pay -- unless you live in the US. Why doesn't the US get NFC? I don't know. A spokesperson for Motorola said that "in the US, NFC capabilities are in less demand within the value tier." Still, it's a bit of a bummer.. Music and audio played over the built-in speaker sounds thin and tinny.. The screen seems a bit more smudge-prone than I'd expect from a new phone. And while I love that there are so many cool ways to customize the G5 Plus, certain features such as the One Button Nav would do better if it were the default setting.. The Moto G5 Plus will be available in spring of 2017.. This generation of the Moto G family includes the G5 Plus as well as the slightly cheaper G5. Both phones have a metal body, but the G5 has a smaller screen, half the storage and a weaker processor. The G5 isn't offered everywhere -- for example, it won't be sold in the US. But even if it were, the G5 Plus would be better value, especially if you're a Prime member.. The Moto G5 Plus will be available this spring , but at this time I can't say for certain if you should buy it until I've spent some more time with it. Look for a full review soon..

What's bad Tinny speaker Weak low-light camera performance No USB Type-C Non-removable battery. The Moto G series has set the bar for budget-friendly Android devices. The G5 Plus has some big shoes to fill in the wake of the G4 and G4 Plus. While they’ve added some metal and the latest version of Android, creating a good budget phone is about balance.. Does the Moto G5 Plus keep the G Series at the top of the budget charts? Reviewers have had a few weeks to test their devices and we’re bringing you the best of the reviews across the Internet.. Lenovo’s made a big deal out of the new metal chassis for the G5 Plus. While reviewers liked the design, they were quick to point out it’s not a full metal case. The upgrade to a metal back also means no more removable battery.. Despite these concerns, reviewers liked the design of the new phone. PC Magazine said, “It's easy to mistake the phone for a much more costly device.” Ars Technica UK gave a similar opinion, saying, “It’s still lighter in your hand and a little chunkier than comparable high-end phones, but at first glance you might have trouble distinguishing it from a metal or glass-and-metal phone.”. Flipping around the front, you’re greeted by a 5.2-inch 1080p IPS display. In the budget tier, the screen is often where you’ll see the biggest difference. However, reviewers raved about the screen on the G5 Plus. Android Police called it “a very good display with accurate colors and superb viewing angles.” Android Central was also pleased, saying, “Color calibration is, to my eyes, on par with devices double the price.”. One area where reviewers weren’t in agreement was the fingerprint scanner. While it performed its basic functions well, reports on the new finger gesture controls were hit or miss. It worked well for reviewers, but many didn’t like the concept.. Android Guys, on the other hand, gushed about the feature. They said, “It’s freaking brilliant and I love it. I want it on every phone from here until they come out with something better. The learning curve was minimal and it just makes sense.”. For performance, reviewers were all in agreement. The 2GHz octa-core Snapdragon processor impressed. Android Police said, “Gaming won't be particularly good on this phone. Simple titles are fine, but the 3D capabilities of the 625 are lacking.”. Depending on the model you choose, you’ll find either 2 or 4GB of RAM. Most reviewers recommended the extra cost for the 4GB. While both run smooth now, it adds some room for graceful aging as apps continue to grow.. The G5 Plus ships with Android 7.0 Nougat—something many phones twice its price still doesn’t do. Reviewers were pleased with the subtle tweaks to the Android experience. PC Magazine summed up opinions well, saying, “aside from the included Moto app (which lets you configure Active Display and gesture settings), there's no bloatware to speak of. Since there's no bloatware, you have plenty of free internal storage: 53.71GB on the 64GB model.”. Which brings us to our next variation. You’ll find both a 32GB and 64GB model. While 32GB is enough storage for many, you won’t get the 4GB of RAM without going for the 64GB option.. For those looking to work on the go or keep their media collection in their pocket, the phone also supports microSD cards up to 256GB.. The next big upgrade touted by Lenovo is the G5 Plus’ camera. You’ll find a 12MP rear camera and a 5MP front-facing selfie shooter. Overall, reviews of the camera were positive—for the price bracket. Android Central said, “The speed at which the Moto G5 Plus, even in low-light conditions, adjusts to the scene, is astonishing.”. However, many reviews pointed out that the lack of Optical Image Stabilization can make low-light shots tricky. Android Police noted, “You have to hold the phone quite still, and it's a good idea to take a few shots to make sure you get at least one that isn't blurry.”. If you’re looking for a phone you can use all day without worrying about your charge, reviews show the G5 Plus is a great choice. Android Guys used their test model for two weeks and declared, “Two days of regular use comes easy. I’ve had this phone for seven days and I’ve charged it three times. It isn’t the battery life champ that the Moto Z Play is, but it’s damn good and in the upper echelon of devices.”. Reviewers loved most everything about the G5 Plus. The only major complaint was a lack of NFC. This means you won’t be able to use your phone for mobile purchases. Android Police summed up opinions well, saying, “You make some sacrifices when you buy a budget phone, but the Moto G5 Plus requires the fewest. It has capable hardware that allows for smooth operation, a good display, an accurate fingerprint sensor, clean software, solid build quality, and above average battery life.". Excellent performance and build quality compared with other budget phones. Its interface is clean with no bloatware, and it works on all major US carriers.. It doesn’t have a major deal breaker and it stands out through the video capture that the camera does, a quality one and also the solid performance for a midranger. Battery life is OK, as far as the video playback goes and this is the kind of handset, that has a little bit of everything.. Moto G5 Plus lived up to our expectations for one of the best models in the middle range. It has nice appearance with metal construction and fingerprint sensor in the front part. The screen resolution is again Full HD but its diagonal is 5.2 inches, which suggests more comfortable operation with one.... - Skye Hudson, Make Use Of.

As the phone that single-handedly created the quality budget smartphone category, we hold the Moto G in high regard and also have high expectations from very new device in the lineup. The Moto G5 we tested earlier didn't quite meet our expectations in that regard. However, the G5 Plus hits the mark and reminds us again why we love this series. It's far from perfect and there are areas where we would like to see it improve. We could use a bit more power under the hood. The design could bit a bit more compact and make better use of space. The design itself could also stand to improve aesthetically as recent models have taken to a more drab appearance.. A big dose of premium, without the prohibitive price tag. It perhaps can't be called truly budget any more, given the price is a long way off from the days of the first-gen device, but then you get a lot more for your money: metal build, some tempting specs and overall performance and software that delivers as much, if not more, than most will ever need..

The Moto G5 Plus is designed to last a full day and then some. With a 3000mAh battery, you can go about your day and not worry about battery life. Go to school or work, visit with friends, and then head out for the evening - you'll still have enough juice to get home.

Using the card-based Google Now, Android quickly surfaces information for you whenever you need it, powered by the same Knowledge Engine that runs Google's web search. It's a personalized and customizable OS, allowing you to add your favorite apps or widgets to your homescreen. You can even download new themes using the Google Play Store, which offers access to more than one million apps, games, books, music, movies, and more. Android 7.0 Nougat adds major productivity capabilities to the operating system in the form of a multi-window view, which allows for two apps to be placed onscreen at a time. An improved notification system allows you to interact with texts and emails right from your notification pane - without needing to open the app. Other features include file-based encryption, a Data Saver mode, the ability to scale text and icons to better suit your phone's screen, and more..

Moto G5 Plus XT1687 32GB Smartphone (Unlocked, Lunar Gray) Reviews - page 2 vqzvrdywsuxaawwa. Moto G5 Plus XT1687 32GB Smartphone (Unlocked, Lunar Gray) is rated. Rated 3 out of. Good phone but with many limitations. The phone's price point is very good and has better configuration. Camera resolution is good; processing so far seems to be better than my other Samsung low end phone. However, it is not without it's limitations. Phone's call volume is pathetic, speaker phone is also of no use. Phone cannot be used as a phone properly!! Setting phone's wallpaper is tricky; I would say the most awkward way of doing it. The wallpaper picture size has to be of a particular resolution. It does not make any picture fit to the screen. Probably the first phone I have seen to be that way. Probably, the lowest priced Samsung phones are better than this.. Rated 5 out of. I bought this after my LG G3 screen started going black, it started rebooting randomly, and no longer recognized its SIM card. The Moto G5 Plus is great. Battery life is excellent (could go 2 days without a charge). The camera is quite good, though I haven't taxed it too much yet. Performance is quite good, meaning I have no complaints about responsivity. The expandable memory is key for me - as I already had a Micro SD card. Going back to the issues with the LG phone(s), one of the main reasons I bought the Moto is I'm someone who holds onto phones for a long time, and from what I've read this phone has no known systemic issues. It's a very good, reasonably-priced, workmanlike phone. It's everything I need it to be.. Rated 5 out of. I very much like this phone. I've had the Moto G5 Plus for over a week and love it. I really like the gesture features (turn on camera, turn on flashlight). It is fast, takes nice pictures, and does everything I need. Android 7 is a big improvement over the version I had before. Only drawback is that this version of Android doesn't play too well with outlook.com so I had to export all my contacts from outlook.com to Gmail in order to access them. Gmail/Google integration continues to tighten, as might be expected, so if you use Gmail you're all set. I'm not much of a social media person so can't comment on that aspect.. Rated 5 out of. I replaced my Moto G3 with the Moto G5 Plus. My G3 died and the G5 was in the mail 3 days later with the free delivery option. The G5 has a larger screen, sleeker design and a faster processer with more memory. Before the G3, I had been an iPhone user, but wanted to save money when the prices increased again. I bought the Motorola after reading great reviews and it was the best decision. Once I got used to the Android operating system (which didn't take long), I didn't miss the OIS system. If you're looking to save money and looking for a high-quality phone, I highly recommend the Moto G 5.. Rated 3 out of. After 4 months of usage, here is my review of this phone. The size is manageable to hold in one hand compared to a 5.5 screened phone. The shiny finish makes is a little bit slippery to hold, so a case is somewhat at must to have. I sometimes experience lag when browsing or using the app or camera. The sound quality is decent but volume is a bit low, even when it's on the max level. SIgnal reception is poor especially if you put the phone on a case.. Rated 5 out of. B&H got it to me in two days. Only have had it two days. The camera hump is not that big.. Rated 5 out of. This is my first Android phone. I just got sick of the whole Apple thing -- primarily how quickly each new OS overwhelms older models. Further, I just have no interest in spending $600 or more on a phone, So when my 5S flaked out, I asked my Facebook friends for suggestions. So I gave it a try. I don't yet know enough about Android to say much that is useful about how it works. But let's just say I am not missing the iPhone at all.. Rated 2 out of. Be aware that if you are going to use this phone on Verizon or Verizon MVNO, that there are serious call quality issues. Be sure to read about them at the Motorola website Community/Support Forums. Simply search on Moto G5 plus Verizon and look for a topic very poor call quality. There is a Moto/Lenovo support analyst that is providing updates to a potential fix for this issue. Users report they cannot hear conversations and others can't hear them either. Be aware before purchasing if using on Verizon. Be the first to review this item. See any errors on this page?.
