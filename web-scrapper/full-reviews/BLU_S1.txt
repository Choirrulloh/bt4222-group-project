There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Not bad at all on Sprint.... Very impressed with this phone and for $129, I can't really complain!!! The Blu S1 has a superb HD display(MiraVision viewing angles & brightness), runs purely stock Android, sleek design, very good camera once you adjust the exposure & image properties(@night change exposure to +1 or+2 & @day lower such to 0 or -1), excellent battery life, call quality, wifi speeds, buttery smooth responsiveness which u can change buffer speeds in developer options, speaker is just OK, solid build quality & feel, excellent reception on Sprint, very good RAM management, very good audio DAC which I only use Bluetooth earphones, very good fingerprint scanner and all in all the S1 is a very good low midrange phone. Scored 621SC&2582MC-Geekbench 4 Pro and the MediaTek 6750T SOC along with the Mali 860mp2 GPU can hold it's own especially with a low res HD display. However the S1 is currently running on the August security patch-SMH!!! Like I said, can't really complain about the S1 and my only gripes are the speaker and old security patch(updates) but I must say that I seriously prefer the S1 to my Essential Ph1 & my iPhone 7...OMG! ****Update****1-20-18 just received a SW update of 324 MB with November security patch along with stability & performance improvements!!!. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars I am very disappointed with the S1. Thought the first Android 7.0 phone from BLU would work as well as my previous BLU phones...unfortunately it does not measure up. My phone (and your's may work better) at 5 days old had to be factory reset, needs to be rebooted at least once a day to make WIFI work again, needs a reboot almost every time I want to use my Bluetooth head sets and does not provide the "buzz" feedback when setting up the finger print sensor. Because the phone works on CDMA (Sprint) and on LTE networks like T Mobile and AT&T it has to be set for your network during a reboot. Takes extra keystrokes, PIN entry and makes the boot process take up to 2 1/2 minutes! There is no way to set up a boot preference. My Windows computer boots faster! I spent 3/4 Hr on Amazon Chat to get a fix or resolution on this (no usable help, did not know phone, menu structure etc) and 25min with BLU support (friendly, but no real solutions either, "we'll let the tech folks review this"). At this point, after resetting the Network settings on the phone, a Cache wipe and clearing all Bluetooth related cache files, the phone has worked for 8 hours without needing a reboot. I will give it another day and if it still has problems return it and avoid BLU phones. Update: I returned the phone to Amazon. BLU could not provide more suggestions than "Factory Reset" - I did that twice!! Problems with WIFI got worse.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars The phone is very pretty and felt great in the hands. The phone is very pretty and felt great in the hands. I don't know why anybody would think it felt cheap because it definitely doesn't feel like that. However, I could never get it hooked up on Sprint. After trying for literally 8 hours and returning one phone and buying another. I could not get it working Sprint did everything they could and they could not get it working. very frustrated I really wanted to use this phone.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars The phone is beautiful outside BUT, I have to reboot it every time I need Bluetooth or WiFi.. However, I have to reboot it every time as the Bluetooth and WiFi do not work or disconnect suddenly. I would like to ask for an exchange in case it is only my phone malfunctioning. I write this review just for you to be aware. It is not like the BLU I used to have, we have bought five BLU cell phones and all worked well except this one. Without offence I ask the manufacturers to quality control and test the products before sending them to the clients. If I received an exchanged new S1 and functions well, I will write my review and change my present experience with the S1. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars BLU is good in that most of the time they are dual .... BLU is good in that most of the time they are dual SIM phones that don't make you choose between which one works. BUT this is the third one I've had that no matter what I do SMS does not work. You may say I'm doing something wrong. might be right, then why on my Moto G5s Plus did SMS work from the start? All I did was insert the card and all was fine. i was hoping to find a cheaper alternative to a $300 phone, the BLU was not it.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great phone. Lousy security as with all Android phones.. I am not a power user, and will never purchase a flagship phone for close to $1000. I purchased this phone after my fifth Tmobile K7 broke. I will never use a Tmobile phone again. The BLU S1 has exceeded my expectations on a phone. While not secure as any current Android is not, I will use it until the John McAfee Security Phone comes out. If you want the NSA and every phone company and hacker to have access to all of your personal data, keep using what you have. Otherwise, I recommend moving to the JMSP as soon as it comes out.. Was this review helpful to you?. Alright so I recently purchased this phone at a Walmart in my local area being as it was affordable and looked promising. Let's start out with the good sides of this phone. 1.0 out of 5 stars Power button doesn't work. Just a cheap phone that actually looks and feels cheap. Not sure why I expected more.. 1.0 out of 5 stars One Star. for the money this phone is hard to beat. good for your grandmother or 10 year old little brother. 4.0 out of 5 stars get this for the non tech person in your life who you simply want to get connected.

The BLU S1 comes with a 5.2-inch 720p display, 1.5 GHz octa-core processor, 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of storage, a 13-megapixel main camera and an additional 5-megapixel selfie unit on the front.. Dimensions: 5.80 x 2.87 x 0.33 inches (147.3 x 72.8 x 8.4 mm). Weight: 4.83 oz (137 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Effects. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Octa-core, 1500 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: VoIP, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable.

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

The BLU S1 has gone official today in stores, but I’ve been fortunate to have had the last two weeks with the device. Since I intend to cover the device in-depth in an official review at a later time, my goal here is to give you some idea of what to expect when you get the BLU S1 at your fingertips.. With that said, let me provide some insight on things that you’ll appreciate about the BLU S1.. First, after you open the box, you’ll. notice a free clear protective case for your BLU S1. This may not mean much to some, but I appreciate not having to order a case for the phone when one is already supplied. I wish there’d been a screen protector as well, though I’ve not dropped the phone or had reason to worry in the last two weeks.. Next, the phone has a good feel in hand. It’s firm and you won’t worry about dropping the BLU S1. The design itself can only be compared to the new BLU VIVO 8L , a phone that sits in the same price vicinity, though the placement of the back antenna lines and the camera flash are in different locations.. The fingerprint sensor is fast, quick, and reliable, though it is front-mounted and not back-mounted as you’ll find on the VIVO 8L. BLU has strangely added a front-mounted fingerprint-embedded home button that has a software home button to “complement” it. Having used software buttons exclusively this year with a back-mounted fingerprint sensor, the presence of both “home” buttons on the front seems jarring. All these buttons work well, but the design will stand out if you’re not a fan of front-mounted sensors.. For those who’ve been longing for an FM Radio, BLU has thrown one in on the S1. The headphone jack remains but is positioned at the top of the device instead of the bottom as it is on the VIVO 8L.. I have noticed some warming at the back of the BLU S1 near the camera when playing games (anybody a fan of the old-school NBA Jam?), but battery life is more than sufficient, giving you. I’ve been able to get anywhere from 20 to 36 hours depending on usage with the S1’s 2,800mAh battery, and lighter users should be able to get even more. As for charging, expect to charge the S1 for 2.5-3 hours by way of the micro-USB charging cable.. There’s only one small speaker at the bottom right of the S1 by which sound is sufficient but not the deep bass that some desire (I wouldn’t expect it on a budget-friendly handset). A micro-USB port and cable juice up the phone when the S1 battery dies, but I wish BLU had thrown in a USB Type-C charging port and cable (perhaps next time).. The BLU S1 comes in 16GB but you only get a little over 10GB out of the box thanks to the 5.3GB of storage occupied by Android 7.0 Nougat. You can always pick up a 64GB microSD card and supplement their storage needs (no microSD card included).. BLU has done its best to keep the S1 as a vanilla Android handset. The drop-down notification and settings menu, as well as the Google software (with only a few software additions) make this handset one that will appeal to many budget-conscious shoppers.. Last but not least, the BLU S1 is the first smartphone from BLU to have not only GSM but also CDMA compatibility with Sprint ‘s network. This is no small achievement for the BLU S1, and we want to point it out because Sprint compatibility alone may change your view of the device if you’re a Sprint or Boost Mobile customer.. And yet, you may want to get the BLU S1 on Sprint because the carrier is running a promotion where anyone who switches over to Sprint from their current carrier and purchases the BLU S1 will get a $200 Visa gift card. This Sprint BLU S1 promo will get you BLU’s newest phone for free. And yes, for inquiring minds, Wi-Fi Calling is included in the S1.. Those not interested in Sprint or its promo can take advantage of Amazon’s limited time deal today by picking up the S1 for just $129.99. The deal will start today, October 31st, and end on November 1st at 11:59PM EST. Best Buy will sell the device outright for $179.99 without a deal, though.. All in all, the BLU S1 is a device that will allow you to do much of what you want to do. If you’re looking for a budget-conscious device with. additional software features, quick fingerprint sensor, some software buttons, and strong network compatibility, the BLU S1 may very well be your next phone..

BLU's S1 leaks on Sprint's site, may be the first BLU phone to come to the network. 2017/09/07 11:34am PST Sep 7, 2017. (1) , (2) , Best Cellular. BLU doesn't make the best phones out there, but they present a fantastic value. The company has a history of delivering "good-enough" at a great price. So with Sprint's coverage site spilling the beans on the upcoming BLU S1, customers on the CDMA carrier should have reason to celebrate.. We aren't sure if the S1 will be postpaid as well as. BYOD , but it is listed as a BYOD-eligible device. Either way, it represents the first device from the manufacturer to work on Sprint's CDMA network. Most of the marketing material we've found shows the Amazon Underground app on the phone's home screen, which could point to it being sold on Amazon.. It's a questionable source, but Best Cellular has a listing for the S1 that pegs the phone's price at $159.95. Season these claims with suitable salt, but according to Best Cellular, the S1 will include MediaTek's. MTK6750 8-core SoC, Android 7.0 Nougat, 5.2" HD display (likely 720p), a 2,800mAh battery, 2GB RAM/16GB storage, and a 13MP camera.. If you go to Sprint's coverage site , you can see the listing for the phone yourself. Select "Get device-specific coverage" on the right, in the drop-down select "Newest devices," and the first phone on the list is the BLU S1. With a product listing already up at one site, and Sprint's coverage map updated to support it, we might hear more about this device soon.. Tags blu BLU S1 CDMA s1 Sprint.

Came here to ask about the software as well, lol.. A shitty phone for an even shittier network. Only took 38 minutes to sh*t on Sprint. Id have to say its an improvement. People need to stop the BS and try the network in its current state.. No thanks, tried them once and dealt with months of back and forth and almost getting sent to collections for a phone I returned.. Isolated incident, not a reason to choose any particular carrier.. Was bad enough for me to learn my lesson, hoping I can help others. The company is so fragmented its ridiculous, tech support doesn't have a direct number for billing, they had to message them and then wait days for a response.. I've seen plenty of people dealing with the same issues.. I have to deal with all carriers and they are all comparable in terms of support. But chat support on Sprint have resolved and answered 90% of my questions, phone support is going the way of the dodo bird.. My sister has it due to her husbands work contract, it's still just as terrible as it ever was.. 60 million customers (and more being added as we speak) would have probably defected if that was the actual truth. Sprint is not the fastest, but just as reliable as Verizon.. As time goes on and Sprint start's deploying 4th and 5th carriers plus more and more B41 the landscape will see a shift.. V and A are already slowing down as Sprint continues to speed up.. Here are some of my speeds.. I am sure there are plenty of people that are happy with Sprint like you, altho this year they did lose customers for the first time in two years. But for me, their coverage here in Boston is absolutely terrible and their customer service is worse.. Actually Sprint gained more post paid customers again..In fact they made a profit.. And I was in Boston recently and with proper 3xCA device it was flying and coverage was fine.. "In fiscal 3Q16, Sprint lost 501,000 prepaid subscribers, up from 427,000 in fiscal 2Q16 and 491,000 in fiscal 3Q15.". I am in Boston 2 weeks out of every month (in China and Thailand the others), Sprint coverage is horrible and all of my family and friends that have it hate it. Like I said if you enjoy it, that;s great, from what I hear and my own experience, it is still terrible.. I live in Boston, and while I can't attest to Sprint's performance, T-Mo here is the tits. I've peaked up way over 150Mbps, and Band 12 deployment gets me a signal in brick-lined basements where my GF on Verizon can't get a thing. Tmobile is incredible here, I would have no reason to ever switch.. I average over 50mbps downloads, and a high of 87mbps. Been a customer over 15 years, with no real complaints.. I was with sprint for over 9+ years up until 18 months ago ( I switched to T-Mobile). I've heard more promises from them (sprint) and have had more frustration with their network then I care to remember. Sucks you feel that way, ISP's are not your friends they are a business. Sales people are sales people, they will sometimes mis inform to make a sale or keep people, Sprint today is nothing like they were just 2 years ago.. If you want to talk shady business practices on a corporate scale, TMobile is up there.. I haven't had any issues with T-Mobile thus far and my data connection seems to work in more places then my sprint connection did.. TMobile is fast just alot less reliable than Sprint.. And enjoying it I shall, while paying less and not dealing with a company that wipes their @ss with Net Neutrality rules and dangles a free Netflix account for distraction on top of running out of spectrum in the not so distant future.. I doubt you pay less than me. I am on Tmobile's $30 unlimited prepaid plan (5GB at LTE). With BingeOn and Music Unlimited, I use over 30GB of data a month but never go over my "5GB cap".. As for them "running out of spectrum", they have an entire 600mhz signal that has begun to already roll out.. 4 lines $30/per line on ED1500 unlimited data no bingeon gimmicks. I'm paying a total of 250/month including taxes with 4 high end devices financed.. I am paying $30 a month, if I had 4 lines I would be paying $120 a month. Bingeon isn't a "gimmick" it is an actual service. Sprint has nothing that even comes close to BingeOn or MusicUnlimited for their prepaid customers. If I was using Sprint, I would run out of Data in a week.. Why is this so much more expensive than the r1 hd?. Probably because it has a cdma modem in it. Yup CDMA requires separate licenses which is why most "cheap" unlocked phones are GSM only.. Most networks have already started shifting on VoLTE or just LTE for data.. Sprint is not the greatest here in West Virginia but as far as Blu phones it all depends on what you buy. My family has been using them for three years. You have to research the phones you have to look at the processer the ram to see just what you are getting. I just bought my husband a new one 2 months ago has 32 gb storage. 3 gb ram and quad core processor. Also Blu has a good customer service. They replaced his phone last year when the charging port stopped working on and it is still working and now. being used by our son This has been the only thing that has went bad on one of their phones and i am sure it was our fault for using the phone while it was charging and we messed up the port. When i had samsung galaxy i had to have it replaced 3 times and each time was a fight. Blu phones are a good phone for a fair price.. The Sprint BLU S1 is in stock TODAY!.

BLU has been releasing budget smartphones for years now in the US market but they have been unlocked GSM-only devices that work with T-Mobile, AT&T, and other GSM-only networks. Now, the company is releasing a CDMA smartphone called the S1 for the Sprint and Boost Mobile users out there. The S1 still supports GSM carriers like T-Mobile and AT&T but it now also supports Sprint’s CDMA networks as well. The only caveat is that it does not support Verizon’s CDMA network.. The S1 is being marketed as being simply brilliant and I’m not so sure about the brilliant part but I do agree that it is a simple budget smartphone. It tries to pull off a metal unibody build construction with its use of “metal plastic” but it’s not fooling anybody here. This is a plastic smartphone that is extremely slippery so I would definitely recommend that you throw in a case. It doesn’t feel uncomfortably chunky or rigid in the hands though. It does have a microSD card slot for expandable storage to help expand the 16GB of onboard storage. We are looking at a 5.2-inch 720p LCD display with moderately chunky bezels, pretty solid viewing angles and brightness, and just average color vibrancy.. Under the display, we have a physical home button that doubles as a fingerprint scanner and the scanner works really fast. The software is really clean and it should appeal to those who love stock Android. This near stock version of Android 7.0 Nougat will maximize the performance of the relatively under powered MediaTek processor and 2GB of RAM. Despite these hardware limitations or conservative hardware specifications, the phone does actually do a pretty good job quickly and smoothly of opening up applications and switching between applications. You will notice some lag when running two applications at the same time but even so, the performance has still exceeded my expectations. I honestly didn’t expect much from this device.. There is a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera sensor with an f/2.0 aperture as well as a 5-megapixel front-facing camera sensor. Image quality is just fine outdoors and in plenty of sunlight but when you bring this camera indoors and you take photos in adequate lighting conditions, you’re going to start to notice some noise and faded colors but it’s what you’d expect with a smartphone at this price tier. The front-facing sensor does have a similar effect. Photos tend to come out with varying degrees of faded-ness. Also, there’s no front-facing flash, which I’m generally used to seeing on BLU devices.. The 2,800mAh battery is not exceptionally large but I do feel very confident that this phone will last you a full day of moderate usage on a single charge. It has a clean version of Android and a fairly low-powered hardware specifications.. And last but not the least, we have the bottom-facing speaker. It’s not in my preferred placement but it’s not in the absolute worst place, which would be on the back.. So this is the S1 smartphone from BLU. It’s their first CDMA smartphone and it retails for $179 on Amazon. When you purchase this phone, you will get a screen protector, silicone case, quick guide, charger, USB cable, earbuds, and SIM card key all included in the box. You get pretty much everything to get this phone up and running.. Videos Android Review Budget Smartphones BLU BLU S1. Products mentioned BLU S1. Previous Article OnePlus 5T: What To Expect.

In addition to Sprint compatibility, the BLU S1 is packing a 5.2-inch 1280×720 display, 13-megapixel rear camera with phase detection autofocus, and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. There’s an octa-core MediaTek MT6750 processor inside the S1 that’s paired with 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, and a microSD card slot.. BLU has also given the S1 a fingerprint reader, which is good to see now that that’s become a must-have feature for new phones. Rounding out the S1’s spec list is a 2,800mAh battery, microUSB port, and Android 7.1.. You can now order the BLU S1 from Amazon. It’s part of a limited time sale that’ll be available through November 1st at 11:59 pm PST, so you don’t have long to get the BLU S1 at a discount..
