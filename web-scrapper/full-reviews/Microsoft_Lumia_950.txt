The Cortana voice assistant and offline maps remain perks.. The Bad Windows phones still have a huge app deficit compared to iPhone and Android. The 950's standout Continuum feature is buggy and cumbersome, and requires separate hardware to use. The phone's ho-hum design feels dated.. The Bottom Line The Lumia 950 is a mostly average smartphone, giving iPhone and Android users no reason to switch, and offering little appeal outside Windows phone diehards.. Continuum: The phone becomes the PC (or TV) See phone contents on a larger display Can use wired or wireless keyboard, and mouse Dock or HDMI port connection options. More Windows 10 software: Iris scanning, cleaner look Windows Hello Interface refresh Customization tweaks. I have a soft spot for Windows on phones. Something about the clean, simple interface appeals to me as an alternative to the relative clutter of Android and Apple's iPhone, and chats I've had with Windows phone fans do make me believe that there are people out there better served by this approach to mobile software.. That's why it pains me to see the Windows 10 update in the Lumia 950 fall so short of its promise. The hardware itself is fine, if disappointingly uninspired. But the software, especially the buggy new Continuum feature that's supposed to let you turn your phone into something approaching a full-on Windows PC, only highlights Microsoft's inability to meaningfully keep up with Android and the. Yes, the phone has a gorgeous display that's easy to read outdoors and camera image quality that keeps me smiling, especially in low light. I can even deal with the plastic construction because of the Lumia 950's removable battery and microSD card slot, which many metal phones don't have. The Cortana voice assistant is also better than Apple's Siri in my book.. Microsoft Lumia 950 unleashes Windows 10 Mobile (pictures). But when you consider all the things that make up a modern mobile operating system -- mobile payments, access to limitless apps, software extras that work consistently well -- Windows 10 doesn't fix enough past problems and only introduces others. I was hoping for more with Windows 10 on phones, wanting to believe in the promise that Continuum would give the Lumia a competitive edge by boosting your productivity. At the end of the day, the Lumia 950 costs too much and offers too little for all but Windows diehards to take seriously. It's been five years since Microsoft rebooted its old, failing Windows Mobile software into the Windows phone platform we see today, and the company still hasn't been able to work out the kinks. Microsoft's future as a world class software-maker for mobile phones is looking dim.. The Lumia 950 starts at $550 in the US, but you'll need to check with carriers, since their prices and payment plans will vary. AT&T, for example, sells it for $600 outright, $150 with a two-year contract, and for monthly installments that vary between $20 and $30 per month depending on which of its three Next plans you choose. The larger, 5.7-inch Lumia 950 XL will cost more, and goes on sale before the end of 2015.. What if your phone could double as a makeshift PC? That, in a nutshell, is the promise of Continuum. It's arguably the big distinguishing feature of Windows 10 phones and something that doesn't really exist in the Android or iPhone realm. It should work with most future phones with Microsoft's mobile operating system (the low-end. Lumia 550 won't have it), but the Lumia 950 is the first model to boast the functionality.. How do you use the phone as a PC? Pair a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse to the Lumia, and use a PC monitor or TV as the primary screen. For any of us who have had to transition from writing a bevy of one-line emails and texts to writing some 1,000-plus word documents from a hotel room, the idea is instantly enticing. And that's why I tested it by using it to write this phone review. (In fact, I'm typing this on my phone -- by way of a paired keyboard, monitor and mouse -- right now.). The catch is that you need to tether to your big-screen display, through two possible methods, and they're both something of a pain. If the TV has built-in support for the wireless Miracast video standard -- or if you have a Miracast dongle plugged into the TV -- you can beam the signal from the phone through the preloaded Continuum app. Alternately, you can go with a more reliable wired setup, using the Microsoft Display Dock (which is what I used) -- it costs $80 in the US and AU$149 in Australia. (You'll also need the right cables.). Using Continuum let me write part of this very review on the Lumia 950, using a connected monitor, keyboard and mouse.. Once you get it working -- in a living room, a hotel room or conference room -- you can share stuff like a PowerPoint presentation or home video with a group of people on the big screen. Then undock the phone, and resume working on the exact same project seconds later while walking down the street.. The idea is really cool, and once I got going (around this paragraph, actually) things started to really flow. There were a lot of false starts, however, and some major setup hurdles that make me seriously question Continuum's reliability. First, you need all the right hardware and cables, including an HDMI and USB Type-C cords. A wired or wireless keyboard and mouse are optional, too, but you can also navigate from the phone screen (while also using the phone independently).. I had some issues with connection and pairing, and the third-party HDMI dongle that Microsoft sent as an alternative to its homegrown Display Dock puck didn't even work when I went to activate it -- its website said it didn't yet support Windows 10. Luckily, I had the Display Dock as a backup. Microsoft's Continuum app on the phone gives you a partial walk-through, but you'll still have to work out some things on your own. As promised, the image scaled well on the computer monitor I used, but didn't quite fit the frame of the 50-inch Samsung TV panel. At least only a sliver of image was cut off.. Navigating around the phone contents on a larger screen worked pretty well. The phone spontaneously rebooted several times during my testing, but only while using Continuum, so that seems like the cause. One major use case is to craft documents using Microsoft Office. Keyboard shortcuts don't work the same, which means you'll do most of your formatting using the toolbar or mouse submenu. Not being able to paste or undo with keyboard shortcuts hampered my workflow.. You can also use Continuum to host a slideshow on your living room TV.. The cursor doesn't quite keep up when you're typing quickly either, so there's a bit of visual turbulence as your fingers fly, and without automated spell check in the Word doc, it's hard to correct errors -- sometimes you will see suggestions appear on the phone screen, all the way down by your elbow.. I do like the freedom of seeing what I'm doing on a larger, easier-to-read screen, but I'd much rather use a laptop for projects. Still, the option to use the HDMI dongle on your TV is the closest you can come to Google Chromecast for Windows phones (Chromecast does work with Windows laptops, though).. Besides Continuum, Windows 10 brings some nice additions to the Lumia 950. While every other phone is embracing the fingerprint reader in various locations, Microsoft carried over Windows Hello, its iris-scanning biorecognition software, from the Surface tablet to the phone.. Even in beta mode, Windows Hello has been working quickly and accurately to sign me in when I peer into the front-facing camera -- much of the time. It sometimes won't recognize you in certain lighting conditions, but there's a PIN for backup, and you can improve accuracy by running it again (and again) in various lighting scenarios so it creates a larger library of your authentic eyes. It even recognized me through my glasses, although you'll need to take them off on your setup scan.. Setup was easy, though the app is hard to find -- get to it through Accounts or Lock screen submenus. In settings, you set the allotted interval required to sign in this way, and you can use it to authorize changes to the phone and buy apps.. The optional Windows Hello uses an iris-scanner to identify you when you log in. Iris scanning isn't faster or easier than a fingerprint scan, and depends too much on lighting to get it right. It's a unique way to sign in, but not always better.. Windows 10 overall gives the Lumia 950 a much cleaner, more sophisticated look in every menu, from the settings array to the way you choose your themes. The app store looks great (but still doesn't have all I need -- see below), and there are a few extras lurking in the menus, including the ability to double-tap nav bar to turn off the screen (but not back on again). Cortana is a good voice-controlled personal assistant, and the ability to download offline maps is a real perk, especially when you're traveling in rural areas or cities abroad, and Wi-Fi and data are limited.. Yes, Google Maps has an offline feature that lets you save a specific map area that you already navigated to, for 30 days. The built-in Here maps app lets you download maps for an entire city or region to use any time, so long as you have enough space.. Everything from the Start screen to the settings menu gets a refresh.. There have always been hard-to-pinpoint things about the operating system that don't seem to work as smoothly as they should, because they seem tiny enough to ignore, like when I email a photo, the Outlook logo takes over the screen until the pictures send. Disturbing this threatens to cancel your email.. If the new features of the operating system are decent (or at least promising), one aspect of buying a Windows phone remains a compromise at best, and a dealbreaker at worst: app selection.. For starters, Google refuses to support the platform, which means that the services I rely on daily for work and personal life -- Gmail, Google Maps, Google Drive, Google Docs -- are accessible only through third-party apps or through the Web. While Microsoft does have an extensive network of its own similar services, like OneDrive, it's a hassle to switch for people like me who are already firmly ingrained in Google's online world..

Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 3), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Optical image stabilization, Autofocus, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI). Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets.

Features: Optical image stabilization, Continuous autofocus, Video light, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Hexa-core, 1800 MHz, ARM Cortex-A57 and ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 23.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 12.0 days (288 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 18.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share, MHL.

GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 06 Oct 2015. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Microsoft Lumia 950 is a smartphone developed by Microsoft , officially revealed on October 6, 2015 [1] alongside the larger Lumia 950 XL. The phone was first released on AT&T in the US on November 17, 2015, [2] [3] and subsequently made available on the Microsoft Store [4] as well as in other countries. The Lumia 950 is the successor to the 2014 Nokia Lumia 930 and is among the first phones to natively run Windows 10 Mobile. The phone is primarily aimed at users desiring a flagship device, in contrast to Microsoft's previous strategy of targeting developing markets with low-end hardware.. Microsoft's numbering convention designates the Lumia 950 as a 5th-generation device in the high-end 900 series.. The Lumia 950 has a polycarbonate frame with a removable back shell, allowing access to the battery as well as SIM and microSD card slots. The phone is available in two colors, black and white, although third-party replacement shells are available in different colors and materials. The Lumia 950 uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 MSM8992 SoC which combines two 1.82. GHz Cortex-A57 and four 1.44. GHz Cortex-A53 cores in a big.LITTLE architecture, allowing more computationally intensive workloads to run on the faster "big" cores while threads with less priority run on the slower "LITTLE" cores. The SoC also includes an Adreno 418 GPU and is paired with 3. GB of LPDDR3 RAM. GB of internal storage which can be expanded with microSD cards up to 200. The Lumia 950 has a 5.2. mm) AMOLED display with a resolution of 2560x1440 ( WQHD ) and a 16:9 aspect ratio. The display is protected by Gorilla Glass 3 and features ClearBlack technology for improved sunlight visibility, as well as double tap to wake, [8] but unlike earlier Lumia flagships it does not support some features like Super Sensitive touch. The Lumia 950 has a 20. MP PureView -branded rear-facing camera, containing a 1/2.4. in BSI sensor with 1.12. μm pixels and phase-detection autofocus , a 6-element Carl Zeiss lens with a f/1.9 aperture and 5th-gen optical image stabilization , and a triple- LED RGB flash that can adjust to match the color of ambient light. [10] [11] Maximum image resolution is 4992x3744 pixels (18.7. MP) in 4:3 aspect ratio and 5344x3008 pixels (16.1. The camera can also capture oversampled 8. MP images, optionally with a full-resolution DNG file that enables more post-processing possibilities. [12] The camera supports video capture at up to 4K (3840x2160) resolution, as well as slow-motion video at 120. fps, albeit at a reduced resolution of 720p.. The front-facing camera has a 5. MP sensor and a wide-angle f/2.4 lens, supporting video capture at up to 1080p resolution. The camera also supports Windows Hello through iris recognition with the help of an infrared LED. The Lumia 950 supports 4G LTE technology with maximum transfer speeds of 300. Other wireless connectivity options include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a / b / g / n / ac , Wi-Fi hotspot , NFC , Bluetooth 4.1, and wireless screen projection via Miracast. Physical connectors include a 3.5. mm audio jack , as well as a USB-C connector for charging and data transfer. The latter supports USB OTG , enabling the use of peripherals like mice, flash drives or external microphones, [14] and USB-C fast charging. The Lumia 950 supports wireless inductive charging using the Qi standard. The AT&T version also supports the PMA standard. With either the addition of a Microsoft Display Dock or by connecting to a Miracast receiver, the Lumia 950 is compatible with Windows Continuum, a technology that allows users to connect their devices to an external monitor for a desktop-like experience. The Lumia 950 originally launched with Windows 10 Mobile Version 1511. Microsoft released Windows 10 Mobile Version 1607 ( Anniversary Update ) in August 2016, [18] [19] and Version 1703 ( Creators Update ) in April 2017. The phone has issues with AT&T 's LTE network when users do not first insert a SIM card before going through the phone's setup procedure, [22] [23] Cortana can cause echoes during voice calls, [24] and the phone has been reported to have Wi-Fi issues. Australian carrier Telstra has claimed the Lumia 950 has connectivity issues on their network. Both the Lumia 950 and 950 XL were reported to experience reboots and crashes after their release. [27] Most issues were subsequently fixed with Anniversary update in 2016. The Lumia 950 was generally well-received, with most reviewers commending the high-end specifications and camera performance, but finding the design to be less "premium" than competing flagships, and the app ecosystem to be less comprehensive than Android or iOS.. Daniel Rubino of Windows Central described the phone as packing "all the bells and whistles that Windows Phone fans have been clamoring for all in one device". The review particularly praised the camera, including image quality as well as features like Rich Capture and Living Images; overall verdict for the camera was "quite phenomenal". The phone's design was called "practical, but not beautiful", and features like Windows Hello and Continuum were reported to be working well, albeit with some issues. The Windows 10 Mobile operating system and its app selection were pointed out as the biggest weaknesses. GSMArena rated the Lumia 950 very highly, saying that the phone "lives up to the hype and delivers on all advertised promises". The review highlighted the specifications, display and camera as being "top-notch" and found both Windows Hello and Continuum to be working "as advertised". While some faults were found with the design, battery life and price, the review concluded with: "Microsoft has done an amazing job with the Lumia 950... It's an eagerly anticipated phone and ... it deserves every bit of praise it gets." [29]. PhoneArena gave the Lumia 950 a score of 7/10, describing it as "a phone ideal for the Windows fan", praising the display as well as features like Windows Hello, Continuum and Office integration. The main downsides were seen to be the design and app selection, while battery performance was determined to be average. Baig of USA Today commended the camera and replaceable battery, while describing the hardware specifications as "robust". However, new features like Windows Hello and Continuum were considered not to be "fully baked", and the design was described as less premium than competing flagships. The reviewer concluded by saying: "When it comes to phones however, [Microsoft] still has plenty of work to do." [31]. Matthew Miller of ZDNet described the design as "an uninspiring, simple rectangular form factor", but acknowledged the practical advantages of plastic over materials like glass or aluminum. The Windows app ecosystem was seen as lacking in both quantity and quality compared to Android and iOS, and the reviewer expressed concern over the performance of the OS itself, although commending a number of features like "the Action Center, the awesome keyboard and predictive text engine, and reader mode in the browser". Todd Haselton of TechnoBuffalo commended the inclusion of a dedicated camera key and overall imaging capabilities, but criticized the design and said the user interface of Windows 10 Mobile "feels unfinished". The reviewer gave the phone a "Don't Buy" rating, recommending readers to wait for an improved successor. ^ Callaham, John (October 6, 2015).

The Lumia 950 proves that there's a lot going for Windows 10 Mobile, though also a lot of work to be done. Its best trick is that it blows up to desktop-like proportions with Continuum, but it sorely needs apps. Dedicated Microsoft fans and willing beta testers need apply.. Microsoft Maps is 'Apple Maps bad'. Update : The big Windows 10 Anniversary Update has arrived on the Microsoft Lumia 950. But unlike desktops and laptops, the new software doesn't bring a whole lot of new goodies to Windows 10 Mobile.. In fact, if you go in cold and look for noticeable changes, you probably won't find any. However, there are some useful additions that will make using the Lumia 950 a little better.. Microsoft has added panorama mode to its stock Camera app – a fairly self-explanatory feature. It has also made the lock screen more informative by allowing for more at-a-glance notifications.. Lastly, Action Center has been updated to allow users to set the priority level of specific notifications so that you'll never miss what matters to you.. Whenever I look at the Microsoft Lumia 950, it scans my eyes, winks at me and unlocks with the words "Hello, Matt" – as if it knows me and wants to flirt. In a way, I feel like I recognize it, too. And, I won't lie, I kind of like it back … just not that much.. It reminds me of my first true smartphone, the Audiovox SMT 5600, a rebranded HTC Typhoon, before HTC even sold phones. It was small, so it looked like an everyday phone and, importantly for me at the time, it ran Windows Mobile 2003 SE.. More than a decade later, that's once again the appeal of the Lumia 950. It looks, feels and runs like your average-sized Android phone. Only the phone's operating system is Windows 10 Mobile , much to the benefit of Microsoft's diehard fans and PC holdouts.. This 5.2-inch phone does try a few interesting tricks so that it's not too basic. Its iris-scanning technology makes for a nifty unlock method and Continuum lets me scale the software to TV proportions for a useful desktop-like mode.. Lumia 950 lays the foundation for Windows 10 Mobile, and it's off to a better start, even if Lumia sales are dismal. I felt like that about the Audiovox SMT 5600, too, before the Redmond company blew it in mobile.. But now it's up against the best phones ever made, like the similarly-sized Samsung Galaxy S6 , iPhone 6S , LG G4 and Nexus 5X. Does it really have what it takes to win converts from iOS and Android, or keep Windows Phone 8.1 users from defecting? Clearly, it's not that simple.. The Microsoft Lumia 950 does its best impression of an average Android phone, almost as if it's trying to get you to buy it, take it home and say, "Too late! You're running Windows now." It reminds me a lot of my Nexus 5X in size, color and styling.. It doesn't measure out to be the thinnest or lightest phone of its size, with dimensions of 145 x 73.2 x 8.25mm and a weight of 150g. But it's still a nice fit for one-handed use with a little extra stretch. The boxy design is palm-friendly, and the thicker-than-normal bezel means you'll never accidentally touch the display.. You'll also never mistake this for a "premium" handset, either. The Lumia 950 is enveloped with a one-piece plastic shell that overlaps its Gorilla Glass 3-protected screen.. While the front is in a glossy black, the rear cover comes in matte white or matte black. Gone are the fun, vibrant colors of orange or lime green, as seen from last-generation Windows phones.. There's a microSD card slot and removable battery. Microsoft played it safe with colors, and it did the same with the microSD card slot and removable battery. It has both, while other phone manufacturers (namely Samsung) have axed these key features, much to the chagrin of vocal critics.. The microSD card and battery are easily accessible behind the removable plastic cover, a boon for professional users. Even the expandable storage slot can be accessed without removing the battery (but the same doesn't apply to the the stacked nano SIM card underneath of it).. USB-C has its ups and downs. Powering that 3,000mAh removable battery is a USB-C port on the bottom frame with fast charging capabilities. I still hate carrying around an extra cable, as much as I appreciate the reversible connection. It'll be easier once microUSB is further phased out of devices at the end of 2016.. The top of the Lumia 950 frame has a normal headphone jack, while the right side houses a power button and volume rocker, or more accurately the volume rocker and power button. They're in reverse order from many of today's phones, and that's how Nokia had them.. In fact, the only way to turn on this phone is to press that tiny power button on the right side.. The speaker is on back next to the 20MP camera and triple LED flash. I was hoping to see a pair of front-facing speakers, but there's one in the back of this phone, right next to the camera. At least the 20-megapixel (MP) camera is flanked by a fancy triple LED flash on its left side, and there's no significant camera bulge, like on the Nexus 5X.. Instead of the speakers I was asking for, I got something else that's long been on my wish list: a dedicated camera button. Truthfully, I've been asking for this for a while, to the point where I have gotten used to – and like – the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 double tap mechanic for launching the camera app, but I'll certainly take this, too.. Not the thinnest phone, but it does have a dedicated camera button. The words "Microsoft" are above the screen, and there's an on-screen Windows logo acting as the home button on the front. Around back, just off-center is another Windows logo. You'd never know it was a Microsoft phone without these, meaning Microsoft's fitting in just fine with cheap phones made of plastic these days.. Windows 10 Mobile has a dark theme turned on by default, and it really lets the deep blacks and Microsoft's familiar blues shine on this 5.2-inch AMOLED display.. A quad HD display with average brightness. The quad HD resolution at 2,560 x 1,440 doesn't hurt either, packing 564 pixels per inch (ppi) into this 16:9 display. That's sharper than the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus and ties the Galaxy S7 , but it doesn't come close to matching Apple and Samsung's brightness levels.. Brightness has become more important for me than resolution ever since we hit 1080p. I'm now more interested in seeing my smartphone in bright sunlight at the beach, not being able to appreciate extra pixels too small to detect with the naked eye. The Lumia 950 does well enough outdoors and has wide enough viewing angles, but it could be brighter at its max.. Me and our new car tech editor, Tuan. Whatever the brightness setting, I noticed this phone runs hot when in use for longer than a half hour. It's most evident when scrolling with my fingers using the touchscreen. The slower (and less problematic) Snapdragon 808 chip shouldn't run this hot, like a problematic Snapdragon 810, but maybe this is why the new Microsoft Lumia 950XL uses "liquid cooling.". The Lumia 950 doesn't have liquid cooling, but it does offer a handy glance screen. This shows limited information, like the time, date and simple notification icons, when the phone is asleep.. Like Motorola's slightly more advanced Moto Display, the static text here is in white against the otherwise turned off AMOLED display in black. It's not a battery hog, but this feature can be turned off in settings.. Windows 10 includes a one-handed-use mode, sort of like Apple's Reachability mode. It drops the entire screen down and stays there even when you tap into other menus. You have to tap the Windows home button to revert it or let the screen sit idle for a while.. This helps that 5.2-inch display feel a smidge smaller for critical, one-handed touchscreen tapping on the subway or tube.. Next Page Windows 10 Mobile.

The Lumia 950 is Microsoft’s first high-end phone to be launched running Windows 10 Mobile. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most frustrating and disappointing devices I’ve used this year.. Judged on the spec-sheet alone, you’d believe that Microsoft is on to a winner. The Lumia 950 has a fast processor, plenty of RAM, a generous battery with super-quick wireless charging, plus a sharp 5.2-inch display.. Yet, the shortcomings of Windows 10 Mobile and the almost budget feel of the handset make it hard to recommend.. Watch: 5 things you need to know about Windows 10 Mobile. In the past, I’ve been a huge fan of Nokia’s Lumia devices. They’re up there with some of the most slick and classiest phones I’ve used and have stood out from the pack by doing things just that little bit differently.. Available in a range of vivid hues, they were built using metal and high-end materials. In fact, even the cheaper offerings were sturdy little phones that displayed plenty of character.. The 950 may have the Lumia name, but it lacks that Nokia charm. It’s a Polycarbonate slab, with curved corners and flat sides, available in black or white. Three clicky buttons can be found along one side of the phone – including one for opening up the camera – while the USB-C charging port sits along the bottom. And that’s all there is to say. The Lumia 950 is dull – and I’ve used budget Nokia phones in the past that feel better.. Some will be happy to discover that the rear of the phone can be removed to easily access the battery, SIM and microSD slots. However, it juts out ever so slightly from the sides of the phone and each time I tried to prize it off, it felt like it was going to snap.. Unlike other flagships – the Nexus 6P from Google and iPhone 6S from Apple, for example – the Lumia 950 lacks the precision finish that I’ve come to expect from a premium handset. Nokia used to be one of the best in this regard, so it’s a real shame to see it lost here.. Since the phone has a fairly small – by today’s standards – 5.2-inch display, the Lumia 950 is compact enough to be used comfortably in one hand. It’s dense, though, weighing in at 150g – 7g more than the aluminium-clad iPhone 6S.. Considering that this phone retails for the same price as the gorgeous Nexus 6P and last year’s iPhone 6, it really shouldn’t feel worse than the £199 OnePlus X .. The Lumia 950 may look like a budget Nokia circa 2012, but Microsoft has packed the phone with plenty of the latest tech. This begins with the 5.2-inch quad-HD panel covered in Gorilla Glass 4..

It’s sharp and, since it’s AMOLED, it offers up a solid punch of vibrant colour – without becoming oversaturated. Blacks are typically inky and viewing angles are superb.. Outdoor visibility is decent too, although there are a lot of reflections under bright lights. However, this is an issue for all phones these days.. My main concern with this panel is that it just doesn’t have enough oomph when it comes to brightness. Switching it from 50% to 75% and even 100% doesn’t result in an obvious difference, instead resulting in colours looking muddy.. While this isn’t something you’ll notice unless you have all the flagships lined up, it’s frustrating nevertheless.. Next Performance, Speakers and Call Quality. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

Meet the Lumia 950, Microsoft's first Windows 10 flagship. Microsoft has announced the Lumia 950 , the smartphone that will carry the burden of being the company's first Windows 10 mobile flagship. The device comes with a 5.2-inch WQHD (2,560 x 1,440) OLED display that'll also offer up constantly glanceable notifications that'll save on battery life. In addition, the unit comes with the same liquid-cooling technology that you'll find inside the Microsoft Surface Pro 3. Internals-wise, the company is promising an hexa-core Qualcomm processor and 32GB of internal storage, but the phone can actually take up to a 2TB microSD card as soon as they're available to buy.. Gallery: Microsoft Lumia 950 press images | 11 Photos. Of course, the biggest draw of any Microsoft phone is the camera, and the Lumia 950 come with a 20-megapixel PureView shooter. The Carl Zeiss lens comes with optical image stabilization that'll promise buttery-smooth 4K video without any blur or judder. Oh, in addition, the imaging unit is paired with a triple-LED RGB flash that, it's promised, should end the days of everyone looking washed-out in your nighttime pictures.. Interestingly, Microsoft's Panos Panay opened his presentation by talking about the phone's dual-antenna setup. Apparently, the Lumia 950 can switch between the two in order to find the best mobile signal in any given location. He didn't say more than that, but it sounds like a similar sort of technology to what was found in some of BlackBerry's smartphones , as created by Paratek Adaptive RF. We'll dig into this a little more when we get our hands on the hardware, as it sounds very promising indeed.. The Lumia 950 is packing a USB Type-C port at its base, and with it comes not only super-fast data transfer, but also very quick charging. Microsoft is promising that the phone will go from an empty battery to 50 percent capacity in just 30 minutes should you let the cell run empty.. At the same time as launching the 950, Microsoft is launching a slightly larger device as a companion, the 950 XL. The internal specifications are broadly similar, with the headline difference being that the XL is packing a 5.7-inch OLED display. Both devices will launch in November, with the 950 retailing for $549, while its bigger sibling will cost you $649..

Ask a Question Start a Discussion. Tell us about your experience with our site. I recently changed my Lumia 925 to a Lumia 950.. I've been a loyal user of the Nokia mobile device for many years - I never had any problems with the 925 but the 950 has caused me some real issues in the two weeks I've had it.. and installed this onto my 950 but since I've installed it the phone keeps powering out mid call now.. I've uninstalled and reinstalled but no improvement. The only way I can guarantee a uninterrupted call is to revert back to headset. Also, the messaging switches between SIM text and SIM chat for no reason - how can it be locked to SIM Chat.. The battery life also drains very quickly - I'm having to charge it at least twice a day - the issue with the frequent powering out doesn't help because powering the phone back. I have to say this is all very disappointing - for such an expensive and supposedly 'current' phone some of the issues take me back to very early days of mobile phones.. I do hope that Microsoft read these messages and maybe do something about fixing these issues.. Can anyone else offer any advice as well.. I have the same question (4). You may check if there is an available software update for the phone by going to Settings > Update & security > Phone update and tapping Check for updates.. For the battery that drains very quickly, you may try. the phone to your point of purchase for a possible replacement.. In reply to pink_butterfly's post on January 18, 2016. Like you and many of the other users I am very disappointed in the Lumia 950. I took mine back twice (three total) finally frustrated I regretfully settled for a Samsung S6 edge. Why? It works, I can hear people and vice versa. falling off networks, starting restarting etc. I can't tell you how many times I've started restarted etc. My Lumia 1520 worked so well with my Surface Pro computer which is what I believe MS is trying to accomplish. What good is it if it is so buggy. the Microsoft answers seem geared toward tech trouble shooters that enjoy this type of thing. Did Microsoft figure out that some people like me just want a phone out of the box they enjoy and not looking at forums like this on a daily basis to get their very. I took the option to upgrade in a year. Hopefully Microsoft brings out a Surface phone THAT WORKS FROM THE FIRST DAY!!!. In reply to WilsonNacario's post on February 2, 2016. In reply to WilsonNacario's post on February 2, 2016. The phone is getting worse and worse day by day. I'm kind of shocked there are not more posts here. Maybe everyone ditched the phone like my wife did. Alarms would delete but then still go off with no way of seeing them to remove them permanently. will stay black when lowering it from ear after talking on it not allowing you to hang up for close to 15 seconds. Have to prime the power button to get the unlock screen to display. Will randomly loose cellular signal and will not reconnect till you reboot.. When you turn the phone off to fix any of the issues you have to prime the power button again to get it to cone back on. I have now had the phone since release and reset it many times just to end up needing to do it again! If the phone didn't look so dam good. and my hopes Microsoft will one day fix something I would have ditched it long ago. Where are you Microsoft? Give up on your long time fans? And sadly I probably just wasted more time by writing this message.......... In reply to weaz1's post on April 12, 2016.

When you turn the phone off to fix any of the issues you have to prime the power button again to get it to cone back on.. Do you use a screen protector or bumper case – does it work without that?. ⅰ) Which network operator do you use, in which country?. ⅱ) Did you try without Wi-Fi and without a microSD?. Sometimes, the display goes black before the phone is off actually. You can double-check this by playing a sound file. That plays until the phone is shut down for sure.. In reply to Abi99 (2)'s post on April 18, 2016. I was just checking to see if the problems with the Lumia 950 went away.. I regretfully tuned my 3rd 950 back to AT+T due to all the problems.. I check here occasionally to see if issues have been fixed and evidently they have not.. I was going to buy another 950 but when I see the problems still occurring I'm glad I switched to a Droid FOR NOW.. I am a Windows die hard when things work.. I too upgraded from a Lumia 925 to a Lumia 950.. Although I was very impressed with the 925, I was blown away with the 950. It is definitely the best phone and best Windows phone I've ever had/used. And I've had my fair share of Windows powered phones... The photos it takes are unrivalled amongst all other superb features.. Best phone on the market with a brilliant OS (Win 10). In reply to GeorgeCallipolitis's post on July 17, 2016. Having reported the irritating flaws of the Lumia 950 some months ago, I too check this site regularly in the vain hope that things may have been fixed.. Every time I get the 'upgrade due' message on my phone, again in vain, I think this maybe the answer. and all the problems, or at least some of them, may now be fixed.. Sadly, I am always wrong! Granted the photos are indeed unrivalled, however the phone continues to power out without reason, the blue tooth (yes I have bought a 'compatible one') doesn't work. and just shorts the phone which powers out again, alarms fail, and I am frequently having to reboot the phone, which has it's own problems such as re-entry of my credentials required but doesn't remember them, so I am asked to re-enter my credentials over. I have always been a big fan and supporter of the windows phone and, sorry Microsoft, when it was Lumia it was a great phone - WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THE LUMIA PHONE MICROSOFT????????. PLEASE PLEASE SORT IT OUT ONCE AND FOR ALL!!!!!. In reply to MoiraDixon's post on July 18, 2016. About to get my 6th replacement phone in 10 months.. No support from Microsoft or ATT.. The 950 is the worst phone I have ever owned.. I have seriously inquired with an attorney about. lawsuit as this is a scam.. also filed a claim with the FTC which I also encourage you to do.. Hopefully MS will be forced to support this awful phone.. Buy online, pick up in store.

Carl Zeiss branded lens with F1.9 maximum aperture. 5.2-inch AMOLED 1440p display (564 ppi). DPReview smartphone reviews are written with the needs of photographers in mind. We focus on camera features, performance, and image quality.. When we last reviewed a flagship Lumia device (the 1520 ), it was still sold under the Nokia name.. In the meantime Nokia has sold its device business to Microsoft, but it took a long time for the new owners to come up with a replacement for the 1520. Eventually the first duo of Lumia flagship phones under the Microsoft banner was announced in October 2015. The Lumia 950 and 950 XL differ in size and processor specification but use the same PureView-branded camera.. comes with a 1/2.4"-type 20MP Sony sensor and a Carl Zeiss branded lens with F1.9 maximum aperture. A latest generation optical image stabilization system is keeping things steady and a triple-LED RGB flash aims to avoid undesirable color casts when shooting with flash. As you would expect from a current flagship, 4K video recording is on board as well. At the front a 5MP module with F2.4 aperture is installed for self-portraits and video-chats.. For this review we used the smaller of the two devices, the Lumia 950, which comes with a 5.2-inch 1440p display. The 950 XL offers a larger screen, a more powerful Snapdragon 810 chip and a slightly larger battery, but the camera setup is identical to the 950's. Read our full review on the following pages to see how the camera on the new Microsoft device performed in our test.. We've considered every aspect of the Microsoft Lumia 950. We examined the user interface of the native camera app and its special features. We experimented with the camera's performance when taking stills and video, and had a play with the device's many special feature modes.. Tags: review , mobile , microsoft , windows.

I only use the camera on either for snapshots and then only for perhaps web use which doesn't require much resolution. I always have my RX100 with me for photos on the fly, however my 6MP KM7D has higher resolution than all of the aforementioned cameras. I use my phone as a phone/portable computer and it works very well for that.. I use the 950XL and people are shocked that the photos I upload from it aren't from a professional camera. Unfortunately it is not very useful to me as an actual phone because app selection is subpar compared to Android and iOS. So this is an app review or about image quality? Image quality is night and day. Video quality is amazingly different in my own test. I thought DP Review would be more focused on image quality (and less about the offense of the plastic back--lighter is not so bad).. However it requires better sensors with 16mp plus to avoid noise. Even a G4 LG is noisy, and ceryainly this 950 does not improve upon it, so O tend to use an 808 for low noise and high resolution even over a D800 in circumstances where I need max depth of field , and have got to really enjoy what 16:9 can do.I'd wait till Nokia arrive with the nextgenhiresolution. I shoot in any light with no problem. Thanks Lars for your review and outstanding pictures. Now, if I can pony-up $500.... As a Lumia 1020 owner, I really would not pony-up anything for a Windows Phone. It's a system that has been falling apart for the past year in terms of software support, both third and first-party. I can't even use it as an effective remote control, because none of the unofficial apps support bulb mode. Official apps hardly even exist and those that do are considerably inferior to their Android/iOS counterparts.. I own a Nokia Lumia 930, and although the camera isn't bad for a phone of its age (if a bit slow), the operating system and ecosystem just seems to be deteriorating. The number of photography apps is low, leaving you with the decent native camera app, but photography aside - the App Store is a graveyard of neglected apps, and is simply missing a whole host of apps that I would love to install. First chance I have I will be moving over to iOS or Android. Right on Gonard, a phone with that processor, ram, 1440x2560 screen and camera is a bargain at $500.. I wish it was so, but in my experience, the hardware is only as good as the software you can use with it and the software available to you is severely lacking. Arguably, it is more and more lacking with each passing week.. I make do with Windows Phone as a platform... but again, for photography, there is no equal to the Lumia 950XL. The only thing that comes close is the Lumia 1520 or Lumia 1020. I have an iPhone 6S Plus that I carry around, and I rarely bother turning it on. I admit the limited app selection, and there are times I do reach for the iPhone, but I am quite happy with the Lumia.. Compared to the iphone, I'm seeing stunning image quality and much better iso. This for me represents a replacement for a compact camera which the Iphone gets nowhere near.. Considered on its merits as a camera rather than image editor, it far surpasses the water colour paintings of much of the competition even some compacts (thinking here of that fuji 'tough' underwater abomination). And on that level, deserves a much higher rating.. Steven Alvarez took some impressive pictures of the Northern Lights and Great Barrier Reef with the 950/XL. still functional and avalaiuble in windows 10 mobile the lumia panorama, just have certain problems with stitching but still functional. Lumia Panorama is not available for native Windows 10 phones like the Lumia 950(XL).. Bilgy_no1 native Panorama shooting is available on the native camera app on Windows 10 (added and improved with updates to the system.). I own the 950XL and I wholeheartedly agree with the comments about the missing Panorama feature.. I find it amazing that a company who developed and owns Photosynth, leaves a simple panorama mode out of their €699 Flagship phone. Especially since they offered that feature in previous phones (Nokia phones).. There are more unitelligible choices like that. Nokia was the first to popularize the 'double-tap-to-wake' feature, and used it on most of their phones in the past years. Now that almost every Android OEM has copied this feature, Microsoft decides to leave it out of their Flagship phones.. The 950 XL has become a decent phone, having received half a dozen updates since its launch. No more hot flushes, and spontaneous reboots like in the first days. The swipe keyboard now also works in the browser (although not flawless yet). Even the creaky back cover has somehow stopped creaking. Now they need to focus on fixing the final bugs and give us the Panorama mode.... In my L950 I have panorama mode. In camera mode I can switch between normal shots, camera and panorama.. Not only is Panorama feature added, the camera operates better.. I have a Lumia 1020 and it nock the socks of everything out there. The apple comparision makes med wonder why anyone is buying in to that overhyped brand. It's so annoying that they cannot understand that the difference is the SENSOR SIZE and not just the resolution and post processing.... Ask a photographer and they would give up all the tech in the world for a larger sensor!. Dimitris......when I can print 13x19 with my 950XL with great detail, the senor is big enough. How does it compare to the Lumia 1020? If it has the same IS, that is a plus. The 1020's 42mp resolution allowed for great stabilized zooms in video mode, though for some reason the camera app would not allow a refocus while recording -- it was either full auto or set the focus before recording.. No one seems to be reproducing the high megapixel count of that camera, is it that the consensus is to oversample for better low light and general performance rather than squeeze out every possible pixel?. The OIS is actually better than the 1020. Plus, it now has digital IS for video.. I'm not certain the lowlight capability is as good as the 1020, but it is still good.. I would be interested in seeing the Samsung Galaxy S7 in the image comparison.. Since the Lumia 950 can be set to create RAW dng files in addition to jpeg, isn't it possible to just profile the camera with flash to get the right color balance?. I'm an IT manager at a large company. The most exciting thing about Win10 is that it is one operating system that run on many platforms (phones/laptops/desktop/tablets/xbox/watches/IoT/etc). This will allow developers to truly write an app once and have it run on all these devices. This has long been the dream of computer science. As a consumer you won't have to buy an app for each device - the app you own will run cross platform and become responsive to your screen size. Think of how some websites have desktop and mobile versions. This is the idea for apps. As an example, if this works, I'll be able to replace $40,000 Cisco teleconf units (that users hate) with an XboxOne running a Skype for Business app!. About the phone, if you read the rumors, Microsoft will release a premium phone under the Surface brand late this year or early next. I think it will be Intel based and not a traditional mobile chipset.. while what you saying is correct and welcome, it is not really about camera... And for big corp./companies GOOD Works so far is t 'standard' ... Windows 10 mobile is not the same as desktop version. There is no desktop, just the apps. And there are not a lot of apps for it. If MS releases a phone based on Intel Atom processor, then it's gonna be possible. Then you can connect it to the monitor, and ahve a full desktop version. But on mobile itself it's gonna be a hassle to use with a small screen, so you're back to apps again, and they are not there.. The similarities this mobile w10 share with the w10 desktop or pc versions are exactly the same apple iPhone iOS share with OSX-running computers. Windows 10 mobile is designed to operate under IA-32 architecture (ARM CPU's), when desktop versions operate under x86 or x64 intel based systems. Meaning: they look alike but it is not the same OperatingSystem.. All, starting with Win10, the OS on the phone and PC (and soon XboxOne) is THE SAME OS. All sub systems are the same, they even run the exact same apps. Yes, there is a fork or new compilation for the individual platforms but it is the same OS. This is more advanced than Win8.1 where only some bits were shared across platforms - Win10 is an evolution of Win8.1 on the PC but this is the first time it has been on mobile. The same OS (iOS) runs on their mobile platform. OSX has some shared kernel bits as ios but the OS itself is different.. To better understand universal apps and I encourage everyone to look up a Continuum demo. Microsoft just previewed version 2 at their build conference earlier this year.. osu9400 is bang on the money, everyone else made assumptions and you know what they say about making those.. You can plug the 950 into a monitor and it will assume the appearance of desktop windows.. A lack of apps/software for ARM version of windows. When it'll run on x86 it's gonna be a diffent story.. @osu9400 W10 phones and w10 intel based (32 or 64 bit systems) -- DO NOT USE THE SAME OS --. @fatdeeman You can plug any android onto a monitor and it will assume the appearance of desktop adroid pc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbOCp6ruans. You can turn any android 90 degrees and will assume the appearance of desktop android PC, it doesn't make for a good desktop experience.. @Petrogel Did you miss the point where I said there is a fork for the different target architectures. Those forks occur after all the common coding is done.. If you're comparing plugging an android into a monitor to this, then you are missing the point about continuum and universal responsive apps. You should really check it out, it's a great idea and what other operating systems will eventually implement.. @osu9400 No, i do not miss a thing , you are missing something x86 cpu(s) are CISC architecture but ARM or PPC cpu(s) are RISC based design, meaning that common assembly code is written under RISC spelling, in other words, this ARM cpu equipped LUMIA phone of yours won't be able (under NO circumstances) to run, let's say , Autocad or CS5 for example, no matter where you've plugged it in. Continuum is nothing more than connecting your device to a monitor.. Microsoft is not new to having the same operating system run on multiple architectures. They did it in the early days of NT. NT Server and Workstation ran on Intel, DEC Alpha, MIPS and even IBM's PowerPC. It was the same OS compiled for different architectures. Intel was RISC and PowerPC was CISC --yet, it was the same OS.. It was never the same operating system there were always different versions. As an owner of this camera, I agree with portions of this review and disagree with others.. First of all, there are some inaccuracies. The review states there is no way to force HDR on. HDR can be set to on/off/auto. In the early builds this was the case and HDR was actually called Rich Capture. Microsoft renamed it to HDR to be more standard for people switching from other platforms. Perhaps the reviewer didn't have the latest version of the OS or camera app. The app is seemingly updated each week.. The review states that there is no built-in panorama lens. That is correct and I don't understand why. Previous versions of the OS had great pano lenses to select from.. The 3-LED flash system gives natural skin tones and aides in the ability to "pick the best light" after the photo has been taken.. Using Win10 (not mobile) Photos app you can select a frame from a living image and select best light.. Large Win10 update coming in June.. and LEDs are better choice vs flash.. wander why micro 4/3 do not have array of LEDs build i. Panorama feature added to native camera app with an OS update.. Nice! :) It would be interesting to see a review update with the improvements (if any) of the latest W10m and Camera app versions (the first releases of the OS were still in a "beta" phase).. The problem with the Microsoft phone isn't the hardware, the software, or even the anemic store. It's the fact they have screwed the customer over and over on perfectly good hardware, if not excellent, that was just released a year or two ago with no updates that were promised to latest OS and have since reversed the decision.. Why would I support them again?. you don't have to support them again. But I prefer win phone over android and iphone - i.e for me it is not supportin them but choice of my likes. The windows phone is beloved by it's owners. It's just too bad Microsoft can't give some of the love back.. Reading cons and pros looks like MS got good hardware from Sony / Zeiss but couldn't get software right - that's nothing new actually.... Looks like a good product, in general. If Microsoft really wants to penetrate the smart phone market, and to have a "plus" over the rest, they need to make this phone (or a replacement one) a dual-boot, Windows 10 and Android (of course not simultaneously). Windows lovers will love Windows 10 and its apps (such as MS Office), and Android lovers will of course boot to Android. Otherwise, Windows phone is not going anywhere. Not many third party developers are jumping on its bandwagon.. Personally, I use a Windows phone, and an Android tablet. MS Office available on Android for free, as well as most of MS apps. But who need MS office when you have Google docs?. @supeyugin1 can't tell if this was sarcasm, but comparing Google docs to 'real' office is a bit ludicrous. Whether you're using Office 2016 or the web version they are significantly more mature than gmail and its band of clunky brethren. Throw end the back end of Office 365 and you have a complete datacenter in the cloud for a few bucks a month. We just moved 10,000 users to 365.. I have MS office on both, the Windows phone, and the Android tablet. I also have MS office on the laptop and desktop. Google docs is OK, but I am more comfortable with MS Office. I have been using MS Office products since the early 1990s, I actually do need them all (Access, Excel, OneNote, PowerPoint, Project, Publisher, Visio, and Word.. First of all, why are we talking about MS Office here?. I choose photography as a way to escape my work... but at that work, and work conducted all around the world, people would laugh at anyone comparing Google Docs to Microsoft Office.. Say what you want about the Lumia not having any apps... But there is no way your argument holds water for Docs as a production tool over Microsoft Office. A high school student may be able to get away with it... but as soon as you need a tool rather than a toy (useful, at that) Microsoft Office is the only solution for professionals.. The city where I was born. A nice place to test smarphones.. However skin tones are nightmare not only with flash. And HDR no matter how many options you have does not made it for me. However front camera delivers!! I also agree with POTATO about usability of 4:3. Most people are looking the pictures either on TV, PC or phone/tablet. And all monitors around me are widescreen. Watching 4:3 on widescreen is throwing away big part of your screen (black borders). actually, Lumia 950 is doing great against top rated phones:. I have yet to hear a convincing argument behind choosing the 4:3 aspect ratio for these sensors. Fixed Aspect Ratios are always a compromise since the ideal framing depends on the subject, artistic expression, the display medium, etc. But given the current known circumstances, lots of pixels get wasted or pictures end up with large blacked out areas at time of display when the sensor is 4:3 native. IMO the 3:2 AR is the ideal compromise because it sits between 4:3 and 16:9, yet it is really rare to see one of those in these phones. I guess everybody is copying Apple even in the bad aspects of the phone, pun intended !. I personally think that 4:3 is a preferable aspect ratio in general, but any one that you pick is going to be a compromise.. There are good arguments to be made for 1:1, 5:4, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9 - and all have been variously used successfully in a variety of film formats.. 3:2 is just common because that's what Oskar Barnack happened to decide to use (quite arbitrarily) when repurposing 18x24 cinema film (4:3 aspect ratio) for his first Leica camera.. I wish Apple switch to 3:2 so everyone will follow.. Very happy with the 16:9 of my S6. Unfortunately the S7 went back to 4:3. 3:2 would be a compromise but given how we see, how modern TVs and screens use 16:9 I cannot see why they stick with 4:3.. "There is no panorama function which is arguably the most used special mode by many users " If you use the term "arguably" for statement then you need to argue for its validity. What is this statement based on?. Lumia Panorama still works in W10M - even rs1 Maybe you want to test it - professionally?. Usually when authors use the term "arguably", it is not used to refer to the central argument, but some less important factor that may or may not be true. I rarely see it addressed in texts. It is essentially a way of saying "some people think that this is X, but let's continue on about Y".. Very nice detail in that daylight DNG conversion but it sure does remind you how noisy these small sensors are!. The sound quality of the drums in the street parade is very impressive. Thanks for going abroad to test out the cam.. Did they fire some people in the Lumia design department? I mean I think my Lumia 735 looks great.. Looks a lot better with the Mozo cases - at least for a while. You can't expect top quality leather and workmanship with what they're charging for a 'smart' case and it kinda falls apart after a while.. But yeah, definitely one of the damper squibs Lumia design wise. I do think a lot of the key people in the Lumia design dept either left before or at sale, or just afterwards - and the people left are detail guys, like "colour and materials".. The wife bought a Mozo cover and it looks and feels great. It's leather so it has a good tactile feel. It added wireless charging so the thickness was increased.. I think the white looks better than the black.. @mailman88: Microsoft actually did layoff 7,800 employees from their phone department just last summer. It is probably less related to the phone's design, as it is usually speculated to be the last thing from the Nokia pipeline.. Using my 950XL, I printed a DNG file at 13x19. Very impressive results worthy of framing. Thank you for this review, Lars. I hope more manufacturers add a physical 2-stage (long press for video) camera button to their touchscreen focus/shutter 'buttons' as more and more people only use their mobile phones for image capture.. From what i see Nokia 808 Pureview is the best of all.. Windows 10 Mobile and Windows 10 in general, is far superior to the toy OSes.. This phones only problem is that runs on Microsoft's useless OS, The camera is nice for a phone !!!!. Agree if this is 2010 but disagree today. It's secure, fast, and easy on the eyes. The SaaS approach is going to be interesting to watch for an OS but I think the benefits of a constantly (meaning monthly) updating OS outweigh potential negatives.. It is nice you really like windows 10. I had the chance to use it for nearly a couple of weeks and it turned out to be a pain in …general…. No i did not like it, windows store can not be compared to neither iTunes store nor Google's play store, bluetooth still remains useless, the whole OS is useless About the security issues, i believe iPhone is top on the list and Androids Lollipop & Marshmallow are doing fine themselves. As for the updates, that's the cool part when it comes to fix bugs, that goes for Win10 phones too. The camera tho was very skillful for a phone , but no i would not buy it , it's huge for a phone but small for anything else, not so user friendly (at least for me), actually i'm planning to buy an iPhone SE, i have missed those normal sized iTunes friendly phones .. agree 100% on the app selection. It's getting better but still woeful. Disagree on the OS though, I find incredibly smooth and intuitive. My ipad has been relegated to a YouTube/Netflix viewing device. For corp IT purposes, Win10 is the most secure and manageable platform available.. Recently my iPad has been replaced by a Surface pro 4, youtube and Foxtel together with Lightroom and Photoshop. But i do not believe mobile Win10 is more secure compared to the iOS 9. had the phone for a week. Only issue is that it overheats and as a result, the battery life sucks. Got the dual sim version, like it. even though data is only allowed on one Sim, not a big issue.. I'm in the preview program (just got a new build yesterday) and the heating issue has gotten better. It still gets warm (depending on the build) but it appears this is something they working on.. I had a Windows Nokia phone before. Actually, a really great phone but the Windows APP store is ridiculously anemic. I mean really, you cannot download Firefox or Chrome? Is this still 7th grade? Microsoft will never be able to capture app developers to support their phones. I like trying new phones out but Samsung and Android got it down pat.. My only real complaint about the camera is that it's more of a minor improvement over the Lumia 1520.. Having owned the 950 since December, I definitely prefer Win10 to the other OS option out there for its KISS setup. Still haven't tried to do any photo or video editing in desktop Continuum mode yet. Microsoft updated the OS this past Sunday the 10th. One can now manually select HDR to be off, on, or auto. It is kind of sad that you went into writing this review without bothering to update your phone's OS and camera software.. Also, not having taken the time to understand how the app works, which would be fine except because you raise up those points as "shortcomings". I would expect anyone expending their own money on the phone to learn hot to use it, and therefore your review misleading.. FWIW 1) It has been a short while Microsoft updated the app so that "force HDR" is available. 2) You can start video recording by long pressing the shutter button at any time, without requiring to change modes whatsoever. 3) On my up to date 950XL the camera launches instantly (less than a second), doubt the 950 takes 2s. 4) Launching the camera does not require a "long press" of the camera button, but a single short press. 5) Every PureView Lumia has had a dedicated HW button, so I don't get "the old fashioned "camera icon" thing. 6) The Lumia 950XL does not have a front flash.. when I started writing this review in my region (Europe) there was no update available for the software. I checked that and, given that the phone was given to me by MS PR, you'd assume it'd have the latest software installed anyway.. I have not used the XL but for some reason we had the front flash in the original launch article. To clarify, the long press shutter button can be programmed in camera settings.. I find surprising Microsoft would give you an outdated phone, so I'm just curious, when did they provide you with the phone?. It may well be that it took you a long time to publish the review, in which case I Would strongly recommend you update it after updating the phone.. It runs on windows 10, so does it not have access to all the windows "proper" software light room, etc etc), which makes android and ios apps look gadgety? Is it a question that it does not have the processing power / memory to run them properly? Or is mobile windows 10 not the same as desktop windows 10?. It runs Windows 10 mobile like the normal Surface. Full desktop Windows is found on the Surface Pro. My hunch they'll merge the two in the next couple of phone/tablet generations.. Surface 3 runs windows 10, not a crippled version.. There are traditional windows "programs" and a new subsystem just for apps. Win10 can obviously run both but they limit Windows10 mobile devices to just apps. If I had to guess, in 10 years all development will be done as an app even if it runs on a 65" TV.. The Surface line of tablets doesn't run Win10 mobile so it can run app and programs light lightroom.. I've had one since December, and I can say it's camera is really good, it, needs a better app though built in and the tones are yellowish. But it's very good as a camera. The lens is great u get alot out this small sensor.. Looking at the studio scene comparisons, the Lumia 950 matches or outperforms all other phones.. it is very good in terms of image detail but not so good in some other areas that are also very important for image-capturing.. However real world samples (especially people and skins) are not all that positive. Actually...there is a panoramic program for this phone/camera as well as many photo applications...not that hard to find in the app store. I have a different Windows 10 phone and find the apps to be very good and easy to use.. There certainly is not one from Microsoft...because they themselves told me there wasn't one. That said, I did not find any 3rd party ones either...which one are you using? The app situation in general is much worse for Win 10 than it was for Win 8. I assume you have not really used Windows Phone, be it 8 or 10 ... The truth is that W10 can run almost every W8 app, plus all the new Universal Windows Apps. For those longtimers, the app situation has never been good, but it has never been better than it is now. That said, Microsoft retired their "Photosynth" app for Windows Phone (both 8 and 10), so it's true that there is no good panorama alternative as of right now.. It's totally true that I don't use Windows phone as much as Android or iPhone, but I am probably in a similar situation here to many Lumia buyers. Fact is that there is smaller number of "lenses" available through the camera app than before and no panorama mode (at least none I could find). I asked MS if there was one and they said so, but they are looking to integrate one with some future update.. Hi Lars, I've been using 640XL with windows 8.1 based OS, then I updated to Windows 10. Lumia Panorama is there even in the old builds. This is great Apps for Panorama as I've been using for a great landscape. Maybe you can update your review regarding those HDR and Panorama point of view. The 950 XL offers a larger screen, a more powerful Snapdragon 810 chip and a slightly larger battery, but the camera setup is essentially, apart from a front flash (identical to the 950's).. You need to take out the brackets after the word "flash" and replace it with a comma so that the sentence says what you meant it to say. As it is, the reader would surmise that the flash is identical to the 950's!. thanks, you are totally right, not sure how those brackets ended up there :). Image quality looks fine for a phone.. Unfortunately recent phones from most brands uses the amateur 4/3 format (and 16/9) which is really disappointing.. Earlier models of the Lumia series also had the professional 3/2 format which could easily be added in software. Not sure why we can't have that format any longer.. Usually you can set the ratio to the one you like. There's nothing "professional" about 3:2 in itself and it's kind of crappy for portraits.. As a longtime DSLR user, I agree that I prefer the 3:2 format to the 4:3 one. That said , the sensor is 16:9 and the vast majority of phone and PC displays are also 16:9, so for me at least it makes sense to have it as default option.. If you turn into "professionalism" then you are likely to edit your photos in the PC, at which point you can easily crop to 3:2, which I often do when editing in Photoshop.. Like many phones the Lumia has a 4:3 sensor.. Actiually, high end professional cameras like Phase One and Hasselblad digital backs use 4:3. And, of course, those shooters see 3:2 as an amateurish panoramic format. I've shot 6x17, which is 3:1, as well as 3:2, 4:3 5:4 1:1. None is more professional than the other, each has a purpose.. 3×2 was forced format for poors, chosen for price despite being awkward for absolute most purposes: bad for portraits, not wide enough for panoramas. 4×3 is a sane choice, 3×2 was typical brainless Nokia move.. When you use ridiculous words like "amateur" and "professional" to describe aspect ratios in this context, you're practically demanding to be ridiculed.. Lars V's response was about as measured a way as possible to set you straight. Just a minor note: The frame lines are bugged in the screenshot, being offset to one side. The most recent Camera app update fixes that, and rich capture mode has been renamed Rich HDR, and comes with 3 settings on/off/auto.. its a cell phone! not a camera unless your a girl taking selfies. It's a cell phone with an integrated camera.. The word 'and' is not a replacement for the period. This article is a non-stop barrage of run on sentences, and awkward wording. If this place isn't going to be subjected to the same editing process as DPR, then the articles should not be linked there. It was a struggle to read even the conclusion page of this review.. sorry you don't like my writing style but I can assure you these articles go through the same editing process as those on the main page where you'll also find quite a few of my camera reviews.. What are you talking about? It didn't strike me that way. Your criticism is unnecessary and insulting. "This article is a non-stop barrage of run on sentences, and awkward wording.". ...is far more awkward to read than anything in this article..

The 5.2-inch Lumia 950 uses a hexa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor, and comes with 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of internal storage space. The good news is under the rear cover is a MicroSD card slot that can raise this number by a massive 200GB, plus there’s a removable 3000mAh battery that can be wirelessly charged. The AMOLED 2560 x 1440 pixel screen is fitted to a 150 gram body that measures 8.2mm thick.. For the Lumia 950XL , Microsoft’s chosen the Snapdragon 810 octa-core processor and equipped it with the same amount of RAM and internal storage space. The removable battery’s capacity has increased to 3340mAh. The screen size has also been increased to 5.7-inches, and although it has the same 1440p resolution, it’s covered in Gorilla Glass 4, rather than Gorilla Glass 3 on the Lumia 950. The device is slightly heavier at 165 grams, and a little slimmer at 8.1mm.. Each phone has a 20-megapixel, f/1.9 aperture, 6-lens camera on the rear, equipped with optical image stabilization, a triple LED flash, and a dedicated camera shutter release.

Next page: All the rumors leading up to the Microsoft Lumia launch. Catch up on all the leaks and rumors surrounding the Lumia 950 and 950XL prior to the launch below. Are you waiting patiently for a new Microsoft Lumia smartphone? If you’ve been expecting the Lumia 940 and 940XL to make an appearance, you may be out of luck, but don’t despair as Microsoft may skip them — in name only, actually — and go straight to the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950XL instead. Here’s everything we think we know about the phones so far.. Specs leak on Microsoft’s website What happened to the Lumia 940? What will the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950XL look like? Lumia 950 Available from:. Microsoft Battle of the Microsoft phablets: Lumia 950XL vs Lumia 640XL Microsoft Lumia 750 and Lumia 850 rumors and news leaks Hands on: Microsoft Lumia 950 and 950XL. Microsoft accidentally let the cat out of the bag with a huge leak on its own website, reports Windows Central. The posting reveals the specs for the Lumia 950 and 950 XL, but not the prices. Microsoft Lumia 950XL will come with a 5.7-inch screen with a resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels, which rounds out to 515 pixels per inch. Meanwhile, the Lumia 950 will measure 5.2-inches and have the same resolution, but a pixel density of 565ppi due to its smaller screen.. Both Lumia phones will sport 20-megapixel cameras and Zeiss optics, which is pretty exciting for Windows Phone users who’ve been waiting on a really good camera. Microsoft plans to add a triple LED flash according to @Windows10Lover , a well known leaker of everything Microsoft. The tri-flash should offer impressive color balance far surpassing single LED flash cameras. The front cameras on both the Lumia 950 and 950 XL will apparently have 5 megapixels.. Previous leaks were less high-spec for the 950, though the XL’s spec sheet was about the same. That means the 950 was thought to feature a 5.2-inch screen with a 1080p resolution, a Snapdragon 808 processor with 3GB of RAM, plus 32GB of internal storage space and a MicroSD card slot. Obviously, both Lumia phones will run Windows 10.. The 950XL was thought to have even higher specs, starting with a 1440p resolution on a big 5.7-inch display, and finishing with a Snapdragon 810 processor. The camera setup and the internal storage memory is rumored to be the same as the standard 950. While the specs sounds great, the real pull of the new Lumia phones will be Windows 10, which will almost certainly be pre-installed on the two devices.. Interestingly, both smartphones will come with dual-SIM variants. Microsoft has added dual-SIM to all of its low-end devices, but this is the first time one of its premium Lumia devices will receive a dual-SIM variant for the Asian market.. Rumors have been spreading about the 940 family for a while, but a report from China stated that Microsoft intends to fast-forward past the 940 name, and release its new flagship phones as the 950. There’s no explanation given for this, but it may. have to do with superstitions around the number 4 in parts of Asia, should the rumor be accurate.. Related: No more than 6 new phones a year from Microsoft. Hours before what’s expected to be the official unveiling of the new Lumia phones, another set of leaked images showing what could be the Lumia 950XL were leaked through the Weibo social network. While the phone itself looks very similar to previous leaks, the rear cover has been taken off in one shot, and a 3340mAh battery hides underneath. Although the camera lens placement makes it look a bit awkward, there’s a chance the battery may come out, ready for a freshly charged one to be slotted in.. The day before the launch event, Windows Central posted a few photos of two phones likely to be the 950 series, originally sourced by @Windows10Lover. The high resolution images show the front and back of both devices, revealing the differences in size and cameras.

The Lumia 950XL has the camera compacted into the lens, while the Lumia 950 has the triple-LED flash on the outside of the lens.. The Lumia 950XL also appears to have a larger microphone grill on the back, with five holes instead of the one on the Lumia 950.. A week before the expected launch of the Lumia 950XL at Microsoft’s October 2015 hardware event, prominent leakers @OnLeaks and @evleaks both revealed new photos of what may be the Lumia 950XL.. OnLeaks started by showing a factory CAD of the Lumia 950XL. The CAD image shows the dimensions for the smartphone, 7.8mm at its thinnest point, making it a touch larger than the Galaxy S6 and iPhone 6S .. Evleaks followed up a few hours later with a press photo of the Lumia 950XL, revealing black and white variants of the smartphone. Button placement appears to be all on the side of the device, a good move for customers with smaller hands who may be unable to reach the top of the device while holding it.. There’s evidence of a shutter release button on the side, and dual rear speaker grills at the top and bottom of the device, suggesting stereo speakers inside. There’s also a grill to the side of the camera lens array, which may be for the same multi-microphone set up we’ve seen on Lumia phones before.. Microsoft branding is restrained, with the four square logo on the rear, and the name above the screen. It’s joined by a PureView and Zeiss logo on the rear, both of which are related to the camera technology.. Before this, our best indication of the design came from. Evan Blass on Twitter , who leaked a set of pictures showing two Lumia phones. He referred to them as the Cityman and the Talkman, codenames influenced by two of Nokia’s earliest mobile phones. The Talkman is the smaller of the two devices, and is seen here in black with a chrome camera lens surround.. The Cityman is in blue, has a pronounced camera lens bump, and a lens design that will be familiar to Lumia fans.. The Cityman was also leaked in another tweet , where a phone that certainly resembles the blue phone in @evleaks photo is seen linked up to multi-USB port block.. The same Chinese site that published the 940 name-change rumor also leaked a set of images that were apparently verified as accurate by The Verge,. said to show the Lumia 950XL. Covered in a protective case, perhaps to hide the final design, it didn’t give much away about how the phone will look. — but the test prototype does appear to be equipped with. a USB Type-C connector, a new addition to the Lumia range..
