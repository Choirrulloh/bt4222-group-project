Fingerprint reader in the home button. Active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic. 3,300mAh non-removable battery; Fast charging support. No phase detection, laser or other advanced autofocus technology. Busy expanding its lineup, Samsung is using a Sesame Street approach of sorts, going through the alphabet one letter at a time. For the most part, this naming scheme works well and helps avoid confusion. We know the "S" line is the place to get flagships, the upper-midrangers designated with an "A". Further down the price ladder, there is the budget "J" series and the Tizen-powered "Z".. But things have been getting a bit weirder lately with the introduction of the "On" lineup and the new "C" line. The latter currently includes the 5.2-inch Galaxy C5 and the 5.7-inch Galaxy C7. Both were made official in late May and are currently available in China and Hong-Kong, but have also got the all-clear from the FCC, which means they will likely be going international soon.. The hard bit is to guess how the C-line fits in Samsung's existing lineup. With midrange specs and slim all-metal bodies, the closest comparison seems to be to the Galaxy A lineup. The C5 and C7 do, however, bring about a few notable hardware improvements over the "A" models, so we're curious to see how the Koreans will market them.. The Galaxy C5 and Galaxy C7 share most of their hardware. The same will likely be true for the alleged C9 as well, if and when it gets released. Design-wise the two handsets seem to differ only in scale and that same ratio is, in a way, applied to the chipset as well. The Snapdragon 625 is definitely a step up from the Snapdragon 617. Other than that, both phones have 4GB of RAM, 32GB or 64GB of expandable storage, mostly identical connectivity options and the same camera setup including a 16MP main unit and an 8MP front-facer.. Samsung's excellent Super AMOLED screen tech is also a given and panel size seems to be the decisive factor in comparing the new "C" models to existing counterparts. At 5.2 inches, the Galaxy C5 definitely looks like a spruced up version of the A5 (2016).. The C7, however, is a little more special. Its 5.7-inch diagonal puts it in the Note territory as far as screen real estate goes. That makes it a bit bigger than the currently available Galaxy A7 (2016) and the A9 (2016). The A8 is definitely a better match, but in the absence of a 2016 upgrade to said model, the C7 might be just on time to fill a gap.. Samsung Galaxy C7 in official photos. The 5.7-inch form factor has stuck with the Note line for four generations now, so it definitely holds a lot of appeal. The Galaxy C7 might just be a perfect alternative for anyone who does not need the S Pen and all the extra features - and the resulting price premium - or isn't particularly fond of curved displays..

CNET también está disponible en español.. This is the phone to beat. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good Polished design. microSD storage slot and water-resistant (again!).. The Bad Annoyingly reflective. Plastic-looking selfies even with no filter. No removable battery, which isn't surprising, but is still a compromise compared to 2014's S5.. The Bottom Line The fast, powerful, beautiful Galaxy S7 phone is 2016's all-around phone to beat.. Perfect for pockets, but smudgy as hell. Although this camera has fewer megapixels than last year's S6, it takes better photos. Less bloatware is a very, very good thing. Editors' note (March 28, 2017): Samsung has unveiled the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus , the follow ups to 2016's excellent Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. Priced at $750 (£689 and AU$1,199), the Galaxy S8 features a beautifully curved 5.8-inch screen with an ultra-narrow bezel; facial recognition as an alternative way to unlock the phone; and Samsung's nascent Bixby voice assistant. The S8 Plus costs a bit more -- $850, £779 or AU$1349 -- and comes equipped with a larger body and battery, but is otherwise identical.. Samsung has instituted an eight-point battery test on its new phones in an effort to reassure customers that it has addressed the issues that plagued its exploding Note 7 last year. To see how the Galaxy S8 and S8 Edge stack up against their predecessors, check out CNET's side-by-side comparison .. Samsung Galaxy S8, S8 Plus and Bixby pix: Come and get 'em. The original Samsung Galaxy S7 review, published in March 2016 and updated since then, follows.. The ultimate way to test a new phone? Travel with it. When you're seeing sights and losing yourself to the moment, there's no room to tolerate a poor camera or buggy software, slow speed or short battery life. If there's a flaw, you'll find it.. So I tested the Samsung Galaxy S7 in London and Berlin, while colleagues also took it for a spin in San Francisco and Sydney. And you know what? It did great. In fact, the S7 was an awesome phone that never cracked under the pressure of being the only way I take pictures and navigate completely unfamiliar terrain, all while keeping battery life going during long days out.. Straight up: the Galaxy S7 is the best all-around phone out today. Google Nexus 6P , Apple iPhone 6S , LG G5 and HTC 10. In fact, the only phone that surpasses it is its own fraternal twin, the larger, curvy-screen S7 Edge , which is technically my top pick -- but only if you're willing to splurge. Sure, there are some potentially worthy rivals out beyond the horizon -- the iPhone 7 , the next Nexus model, and the Galaxy Note 6. But none of them will likely be on the market for months to come. So, for now, the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge remain the best phones money can buy.. Here's what I found (along with fellow S7-testers) while using the S7 around Europe. You can also scroll to the end for a specs comparison chart.. Editors' note: This review was originally posted on March 8, 2016 and last updated on April 16, 2016.. Samsung's gleaming Galaxy S7 is all win (pictures). I began my testing on London's crowded, bagpipe-festooned bridges and streets. Since I constantly mashed the S7 into my jeans and jacket pockets only to retrieve it again for a weather check, photo, digital payment or to navigate around, its approachable size was a much better fit for me than a larger phone. "Medium" by today's bonkers standards, it has a 5.1-inch screen.. All Galaxy S7, all the time. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge tops them all. Best Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge cases. Throughout all this nonstop handling, the S7's curved back and sides made it comfortable to hold, and the one time I dropped it it didn't dent or break. That was only a few feet off the floor inside a pub, mind you -- I'm sure it'd sustain more damage if it had clattered onto pavement.. I spent a good, long time staring at the S7. That curve-back design I mentioned and some very slight rounding on the edges around the display are damn nice, giving the phone a far more luxe and contoured appearance than most, including last year's ramrod-straight. In fact, look closely at the details and you can see that this S7 is built better than previous Galaxy phones.. One downside to the S7's shiny metal-and-glass backing is that smudges pile up on smudges, leaving a semi-permanent sheen of finger grease all over your expensive property. It's gross, and a pain to constantly clean, which always fails anyway. But like all beautiful phones, you're bound to slap a case on it anyway, so it's almost a moot point -- just not an excuse.. I took a boatload of photos in London while testing the phone, but when my sister and I went to Berlin for the weekend, all hell broke loose. Every pastry and pretzel, imposing museum, graceful river crossing; every glorious kebab and lip-smacking beer became an opportunity for dutiful documentation.. What was confirmed again and again is that crisp photos from the 12-megapixel camera countered low-light interference in every darkened cocktail bar, moodily lit restaurant and dusk-dimmed park.. Scenes are brighter, which makes the action easier to see.. Even in low-light scenes, such as a Berlin speakeasy, the S7 trumps the iPhone 6S, yielding brighter, more usable photos. Digital noise was still there, just diminished; those small speckles of color that infiltrate the picture are an inevitability in low-light digital camera shots.. Whip-quick autofocus was also a winner, grabbing clear shots of moving objects, like swaying flowers (yes, I really do take photos of flowers) and my sister lunging like a lightsaber-wielding Jedi in front of a mural (fear her!).. Photos didn't just look great on the S7's sharp screen; they also stood up to enlarged views on my laptop and an even larger monitor back in London.. The seriously fast autofocus and optical image stabilization helped capture flowers in strong winds.. I also really liked using the new, optional preview mode that lets you delete or share photos immediately after taking them. Oh yes, the S7 has optical image stabilization (OIS), which helped keep my photos from blurring after all those jetlag-fighting coffees.. I'm still less sure of the 5-megapixel front-facing camera, which now has even more "beautification" filters than before. I never liked these, even though I'm vain enough that I don't want to see every line and wrinkle. To me, they make skin appear plastic and dull; maybe the uncanny valley of too-perfect skin, but I know plenty of people who love the youthening effect. At any rate, I turned all of these filters to zero, but still found that selfies either looked fake or overly harsh. Something in the processing seems off, but this isn't a dealbreaker by any means.. Selfies looked a little off: either too smooth or too sharp, even with beauty modes off.. I did use the S7's front-facing screen "flash" to light dark selfie scenes, which basically means the phone screen whites-out before the camera fires. This came in handy, since my sister basically selfie-documented every move we made for her husband and kids, especially at dinner and the bar. Toning down the brightness would make it more useful, especially if I could pick a warmer color temperature or lower brightness setting to make it all less intense. The iPhone 6S' similar selfie-flash did better in the same scenes.. Back in London, my appreciation for Samsung's more restrained customizations to the Android 6.0 software settled in. The S7 slims down the bloatware considerably, while leaving plenty of advanced settings for customizing everything from the lock screen to phone themes -- you just have to dig a little deeper now to find everything. Samsung also added a few nice-but-subtle optional touches, like a new "tray" to help you easily move app icons from one screen to another.. Dedicated gaming tools help you record and screenshot your sessions.. Speaking of extra touches, I really like the idea of the Game Launcher, a set of tools you can turn on to trigger some quick actions, like recording the screen or minimizing your game so you can do something else. I'm not the kind of active gamer who would immediately benefit from these features, so trying it out on the subway threw off my movements when playing more precision-based games, like the Riptide 2 racer.. My colleague Jason Parker in San Francisco liked being able to turn off all alerts (with the exception of actual incoming phone calls), but pointed out that the notification for an incoming call still covers most of the screen -- so this particular feature doesn't go far enough.. During my week away from San Francisco (aka home), I fell in love with the S7's new always-on display, which shows you either the clock, a calendar or an image. It was immediately useful for checking the time and the phone's battery levels, a constant worry, without actually having to take the phone out of standby. I also set up a clock for the local timezone and the one at home, so I knew when it was too early to call or text.. You always know the time and where you stand with battery life.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News. Homeland Security's tall order: A hacker-free election. 'Annihilation' director wove memory into a dream-like movie.

Mobiles / Samsung Mobile Phones / Samsung Galaxy C7 Price in India. User Visits: 1,423 Launch Date in India: 10 January, 2018 Compare. The South Korean handset maker, Samsung is now coming up with new series of mid-range smartphones apart from its J-series. This new series is called C-series and Samsung is already all set to launch a couple of smartphones in this lineup. Samsung Galaxy C7 is the first handset to be launched by the brand under this series and it looks promising. Here is a brief overview of the handset for those who might be interested in this one.. Good Camera : Samsung has finally retired the 16 Megapixels snapper on its flagship devices in favor of the 12 Dual Pixels snapper. However, the brand will not retire the 16 Megapixels camera yet and Is bringing it back in its newest Galaxy C7 handset. Having a flagship camera module on a mid-range handset is a good bet for the brand.. Brilliant display : Samsung is going to launch the first C-series smartphone with a decent 5.5-inch display with Super AMOLED on the front panel. This display boasts of a full HD resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels, therefore, visual experience is quite good.. Improved Touchwiz UI: The newest smartphone would come with the latest Touchwiz UI from the brand. Having received severe criticism from users in the past, Samsung finally trimmed bloatware from it and the new iteration has been tweaked for enhanced performance.. Audio output is average: The Samsung Galaxy C7 comes with an average loudspeaker located on the bottom of the handset.

Samsung Galaxy C7 and C5 rumors. Metal body phones Galaxy C7 Galaxy C5 Release date Samsung Civil War: Which is better, the Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge? Turns out the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge can move apps to the MicroSD card Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge is official, but will there be a Galaxy S7 Edge Plus?. Samsung’s never one to settle on selling a couple of phones, when it could pile dozens of them up on store shelves. The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge have reportedly been successful, and rumors are gathering the latest flagships may be joined by revamped mid-range devices, which replace the S with a C in the model names. Here’s what we think we know about Samsung’s C-series smartphones so far.. The Galaxy C-series phones are potentially going to replace Samsung’s A-series hardware , and as such, may mix metal and glass to give a premium finish. exclusive on the C Series revealed. that the phones may have thin profiles and an all-metal design.. In fact, a new leak from French site. this new metal body design, showing that the device seems to take some design cues from HTC’s One series of phones, as well as from the more recent iPhone 6. In the leak we can see a fairly large camera module, as well as a dual-tone flash for that camera. This leak also seemingly confirms the benchmark leaks we’ve already seen, as it has the same “SM-C5000” model number.. If the rumors prove accurate, the Galaxy C7 will be surprisingly powerful for a mid-range device, and come with specifications that wouldn’t look out of place on the very best smartphones from last year. A leaked benchmark test shows the phone with a 2,0GHz Snapdragon 625 octa-core processor, a chip only made official by Qualcomm back in February , which uses the same 14nm build process as the Snapdragon 820.. Related: Samsung’s new Galaxy A9 improves on last year’s model. This makes it more energy efficient, up to 30 percent over previous models like the Snapdragon 617, plus it’s expected to be joined by 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage space. The screen is estimated to measure 5.5-inches and have a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution. The benchmark results also showed a 16-megapixel rear camera and an 8-megapixel front camera onboard.. A few days before the Galaxy C7 was possibly given its benchmark test, rumors of a Galaxy C5 phone were published by SamMobile , stating it would have a 5.2-inch screen with an unknown display resolution. A benchmark test for this phone was apparently carried out while it was using a Snapdragon 617 chip, again with 4GB of RAM.. The SamMobile China report also says the Galaxy C-series will be introduced in China during May, and gives the impression they won’t make an international debut, at least not straight away. However, if they are to replace the Galaxy A phones, then we’d expect a wider launch in the near future. We’ll keep you updated with news and rumors on the Galaxy C5, Galaxy C7, and any other C-series phones here.. Updated on 05-05-2016 by Christian de Looper: Added info about C5 leaked images..
