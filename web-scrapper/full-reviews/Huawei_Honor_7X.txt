The Huawei Honor 7X is an excellent unlocked phone that boasts flagship-level features at an affordable $200 price.. There's never been a better time to be shopping for a new phone on a budget. The Huawei Honor 7X, for instance, brings flagship-level features to buyers who wouldn't dream of spending $700-plus on a new device. For $199, the 7X gets you an 18:9 edge-to-edge display that maximizes screen real estate and minimizes bezel. You also get a sleek aluminum unibody build, solid specs, and a capable pair of rear cameras. The Motorola Moto G5 Plus remains our Editors' Choice in this price range thanks to longer battery life and a lighter software layer, bu the Honor 7X is a worthy alternative if you prefer its form factor.. The Honor 7X departs from the Honor 6X in a few ways. While the phones share a metal unibody design, the 5.9-inch 7X is tall and narrow, measuring 6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and 5.8 ounces. That's nearly identical to the 6-inch OnePlus 5T (6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 5.7 ounces), and you get much more screen space than the similarly sized 5.2-inch G5 Plus (5.9 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces).. View All 8 Photos in Gallery. I found it easy to reach across the phone, though stretching your fingers from top to bottom is more of a challenge. You do get quite a few customizable one-handed modes that let you shrink the screen, move the keyboard to the right or left, or place a floating navigation dock anywhere you want, so no matter your hand size you shouldn't have much trouble.. The fingerprint sensor is on the back, toward the middle, and within easy reach of your index finger. The camera sensors are in the top right corner, so there's little chance you'll smudge the lenses when unlocking the phone. A micro USB charging port is on the bottom, which is a bit of a bummer if you're hoping to make the switch to USB-C.. The front of the phone is home to a 5.9-inch, 2,160-by-1,080-pixel screen. The 407ppi screen isn't as dense as the G5 Plus (424 pixels per inch), but I wasn't able to see any pixelation. Color accuracy is solid, and Huawei's Settings menu is loaded with customization options to change screen temperature and color saturation. By default, the 7X has rich, saturated colors that look like they're pressed up against the screen, similar to the Apple iPhone X. Viewing angles are great, but screen brightness could be higher. And the 7X is dimmer than the 6X, so it's a bit harder to see outdoors under direct sunlight.. As with other 18:9 phones, there are some display scaling issues. Some apps have already been optimized to work fine, while others, including most games, can be forced into full-screen mode. But for some, you're going to get letterboxing with bars on the top and bottom.. Interestingly, Huawei claims that while the 7X isn't up to any military standards for ruggedness, it is still durable thanks to "airbags" in each of its corners, so it can withstand drops better than most phones. It feels sturdy enough, but we didn't subject it to any torture tests and we wouldn't expect it to stand up the damage like the officially ruggedized Galaxy S8 Active .. The Honor 7X supports LTE bands 2/4/5/7/12/17, which gives it good connectivity on GSM carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile, though there's no support for Sprint or Verizon. It can take two SIM cards at the same time, one on 4G and one on 2G. I tested the 7X on AT&T and T-Mobile in midtown Manhattan and saw good network performance on both.. It also supports Wi-Fi on the 2.4GHz band and Bluetooth 4.1. If you want dual-band Wi-Fi or the ability to stream audio to multiple devices, the Moto X4 is an option, but it'll cost you nearly double.. Voices are gravelly and a bit on the robotic side, though transmissions remain audible. The earpiece is loud and easy to hear, and there's an extra loud mode for when you're outdoors. Noise cancellation is good, aside from some minor crackling from wind .. As you might guess from the price, specs are of the midrange variety. The US model (and the one we have for review) sports a Kirin 659 processor clocked at 2.4GHz with 3GB RAM and 32GB of storage. Huawei is selling a 7X with beefier storage and memory outside the US. Despite testing the base model, performance is solid across the board. In the AnTuTu benchmark, a measure of overall system performance, the phone scores 62,820, which is a little less than the Snapdragon 625-powered G5 Plus (63,845). The Honor 7X far surpasses entry-level phones like the Moto E4 (36,394), but can't stand up against the much more powerful OnePlus 5T (169,703).. Opening and switching apps is smooth and responsive, and demanding games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Modern Combat 5 both run smoothly, though the former crashed once I neared the RAM usage limit. The heavy UI means you might see some animation stutter compared with the cleaner stock Android build on the G5 Plus.. Left to right: Honor 6X, Honor 7X. Despite a sizable 3,340mAh battery, the phone clocked 5 hours, 11 minutes when we streamed full-screen video over LTE at maximum brightness. That's two hours less than the OnePlus 5T (7 hours, 10 minutes) and G5 Plus (7 hours, 35 minutes). That said, in more standard typical usage scenarios the phone can last a full day, and comes with a profusion of built-in power saving options that let you limit background activity, disable animations, lower screen resolution, optimize apps, and turn off connectivity, potentially adding hours of screen time. One downside of sticking with the older micro USB standard means the 7X doesn't support fast charging, taking nearly three hours to top up.. See How We Test Cell Phones. The 16-megapixel and 2-megapixel rear cameras on the 7X deliver pretty standard midrange performance. That means they take good, fairly crisp shots outdoors and in bright settings, but tend to get noisy in lower light. Outside, color reproduction is good, focus is fast, and there's minimal noise and grain. Indoors or in dim settings, things can be a little more dicey, with noisy or out-of-focus shots being somewhat common.. Pro mode lets you adjust things like white balance and ISO to improve clarity. There's also bokeh, a nifty feature that lets you focus on a foreground object and blur out the background. The blur effect is a little stronger than the 6X , but won't match the smooth, uniform look you get on flagship phones. There's also a portrait mode when you're taking photos of an individual. Again, it's a cool effect for adding depth to a shot, but don't expect the same degree of crispness or the many background lighting options you'll find on the iPhone X.. Video is available at 1080p; 4K capture isn't supported. There's no OIS so recordings can be a bit jittery, but they're clear in good lighting. An 8-megapixel front camera takes solid selfies , but hasn't changed much from the 6X. It's clear enough outdoors but a bit soft indoors, often adding a warm tint that makes photos look overprocessed.. The 7X comes running Android 7.1 Nougat with Huawei's EMUI 5.1. Huawei says the phone will get an update to Android 8.0 Oreo in the future. EMUI is a heavy software layer that alters app icons and the settings menu, and adds new features. By default, apps are splashed across the home screens, but you can enable the app drawer if you prefer it. There are also a slew of features like the aforementioned power-saving modes for the battery, performance-boosting modes, display tweaks, and gesture controls.. Bloatware is fairly minimal, consisting mostly of Huawei apps. Out of 32GB of storage, the 7X has 19.74GB free. It can take a microSD card up to 256GB instead of a second SIM card if you need more storage. Adoptable storage isn't supported, so the memory card will appear as a separate volume.. At $200, the Honor 7X is priced similarly to the Moto G5 Plus. It has a sleek build that incorporates a tall, 18:9 aspect ratio to maximize screen real estate, along with solid overall performance, and decent camera capabilities. The G5 Plus, meanwhile, gets you a traditional aspect ratio, stock Android, and longer battery life. It's a slightly better choice than the Honor 7X for most users, but if you prefer the 18:9 design, by all means get the Honor —the differences in performance are negligible. If you're looking for an even more affordable option, the Moto E4 offers just enough power to meet basic phone needs.. Bottom Line: The Huawei Honor 7X is an excellent unlocked phone that boasts flagship-level features at an affordable $200 price.. Ajay Kumar is PCMag's Analyst obsessed with all things mobile.

CNET también está disponible en español.. Big on display, small on price. The Honor 7X comes with a massive screen and charges little for it.. by November 19, 2017 4:01 PM PST. Huawei Honor 7X goes big on the display. Huawei-owned Honor isn't trying to battle the iPhone X ( $1,099.99 at Best Buy ) or Galaxy S8 ( $597.42 at Amazon.com ) with its latest phone. Instead, the Honor 7X is aimed squarely at those of you who don't want to splash the cash on elite handsets, but still want some of the pizzazz that comes with them.. With an expected price somewhere under the £300 mark, the 7X is more closely related to the similarly affordable Moto G5 Plus ( $209.99 at Walmart ). While the G5 has a water resistant design (which the 7X does not), the Honor's great screen and slicker overall design makes it the more compelling choice. How the two truly stack up remains to be seen in our full review.. There's no official price as yet, but it's expected to be below £300 (the previous Honor 6X ( $169.98 at Amazon.com ) went on sale for £225). There's no word on when the phone will land in the US or Australia, but for reference, even an estimated £280 price converts to $369 and AU$485.. The screen is where the excitement lies. It's a massive 5.93-inch affair, with tiny bezels on all sides. With a fingerprint scanner on the back, rather than the front, the display has been able to take up all available room in the chassis. Sure, the Galaxy S8, Google Pixel 2 XL ( $849.99 at Best Buy ) and Huawei Mate 10 Pro ( $738.11 at Amazon.com ) have all done that, but they'll both cost you hundreds more.. And you get a lot of phone for that money.. First off, those slim bezels make it look like a much more premium device than the affordable price suggests. It's wrapped in a full metal shell,. which looks slick and feels great to hold. The deep blue colour stands out nicely against the slew of black and silver phones knocking about. The 2,160x1,080-pixel resolution makes text look pin sharp and it's easily bright enough to use under our harsh office lights.. It's loaded with a quad-core, Huawei-made Kirin 659 processor with 4GB of RAM. It's certainly no match for the S8 or Pixel 2 ( $639.99 at Amazon Marketplace ) in benchmark scores, but in my tests I found it to be perfectly nippy enough for all your everyday emailing and Instagramming. It handles demanding games like Riptide GP: Renegade and N.O.V.A Legacy well enough for casual gamers too.. The rear 16-megapixel camera takes colourful shots with plenty of detail. Colours can be on the cold side, but there's a manual camera mode where you can adjust the white balance to get a nicer tone.. A second lens provides depth information, letting you capture photos with shallow depth of field, and indeed there's a 'Portrait Mode' just like you'll find on the iPhone 8 Plus ( $526.40 at Amazon.com ) and X. It does a decent job of isolating your subject by giving the background an attractive blur. The cut out of your subject isn't as neat as the iPhones ( $799.99 at Best Buy ) manage, but it's more than good enough to add some cool effects to your portraits on Instagram.. The 8-megapixel front-facing camera takes sharp shots and has quite a wide angle of view so you won't need to squash your friends in too closely to get everyone in view.. What you won't find on the 7X is any kind of water resistance, something that is becoming a standard on higher-end phones. Keep it away from any potential splashes and be careful taking calls in the rain. It charges using the older micro USB, rather than USB-C, which isn't much of a problem as it means you can keep using the charging cables you had from your previous handset.. It also launches with the older Android Nougat software, rather than Oreo. It's a shame not to see the latest version on board, given that it's been available for some time, but I can just about forgive it, given the price of the phone. Honor is currently looking at early next year for an update to Oreo.. The 3,340mAh battery (non-removable) is pretty sizeable, although that large screen will be an energy hog. I would expect to get a day of power with careful use, but we'll test that fully in the review.. 5.6 x 2.8 x 0.34 in. 5.86 x 2.68 x 0.32 in.

Lein December 12, 2017 9:37 am. HiSilicon Kirin 659 Octa-core (4x2.36GHz + 4x1.7GHz Cortex-A53) ARM Mali T830-MP2 GPU. 5.93 inches LCD 1080 x 2160 (~407 ppi). Europe: 4GB RAM China: 3GB or 4GB options US: 3GB RAM. Europe: 64GB China: 32GB or 64GB options US: 32GB. Rear: 16MP + 2MP focus dual-camera Front: 8MP. EMUI 5.1 Android 7.0 Nougat. Hardware and Design Software HiSuite Camera Battery Honor 7X Review Conclusion. Huawei has been doing pretty good in the smartphone business lately. For 3 months in 2017 they were the second largest smartphone manufacturer in the world, just behind Samsung and above Apple. We’ve been pretty big fans of the Honor 5X and Honor 6X of years passed, so the latest Honor 7X update for 2018 is certainly of interest. This range has always been known for having a great premium quality feel and extremely respectable specs with a price tag in the budget friendly $200 range. Will the Honor 7X make you question the need to spend over $800 on the latest smartphone? It certainly might! Let’s find out in our Honor 7X review below!. What’s in the box? Just the phone and a Micro-USB charger.. In the hand, the Huawei Honor 7X feels a lot like any other modern high end smartphone. It really feels like an iPhone X or a Google Pixel 2XL. The screen is huge with very thin bezels for something in this price range. The automatic brightness control very nicely keeps the screen visible in many lighting conditions, however when it’s very dark, the screen goes down to its lowest brightness level, and for me that’s hard to see. I wish it could keep just a little brighter. Of course, that’s easy to adjust with a swipe from the top edge and slight drag of the brightness slider.. You can see that the screen is best viewed straight on as well. There are some viewing angle issues, but again, you can’t expect an amazing high-end screen in this price range. Honestly, this screen is probably better than you’d expect, especially since it has 2160 x 1080 pixels and a 407 pixels per inch density.. The 5.93-inch 2:1 aspect ratio (18:9 aspect for people who don’t understand math), is very awkward to use with one hand. This wouldn’t be the case if Android and all Android apps were designed with usability in mind, but they continue to place buttons miles away from each-other at the top AND bottom edges of the screen. The 2:1 screen exasperates this usability problem. The Honor 7X does have a one-handed usability mode that you access by swiping along the navigation bar at the bottom edge of the screen. All this does is shrink everything on the screen, thus making it more difficult to read and leaving a big black L-shaped border throughout the rest of the phone. It looks like a total bodge in terms of user interface design.. Unlike some other Huawei phones, the Honor 7X keeps the finger print scanner on the back. This makes it very easy to access with your index finger while holding the phone. It makes accessing the fingerprint scanner much more difficult when the phone is in a car dock or placed on a table. The scanner is inset into the body within a circle though, so it’s very easy to feel its location without having to look. Some devices give no tactile feedback for the location of the fingerprint scanner and that makes it more difficult to use. The Honor 7X doesn’t have that problem.. With EMUI 5.1 you get a number of nice fingerprint scanner gestures that help you control things with one hand and without having to touch the screen. For example, (if you turn on these options in the settings) you can swipe downward on the fingerprint scanner to show the top-edge notifications tray. Swiping side to side in the photos app lets you flip through photos, and holding it can let let you take a picture in the camera app.. Speaking of the camera, there are 2 cameras on the back here. One is a 16Mp sensor, which is used as the main one for image capture. The other is a 2Mp sensor which is only used for calculating depth of field information. It’s not a different focal length that you can switch to in order to change the view from a wide-angle to a normal or telephoto view. It’s only there for use with the fake blur filters. There’s also a single LED flash, and you know how bad those are… but it’s better than nothing.. The bottom edge of the Honor 7X is where you’ll find a 3.5mm TRS headphone jack. Many phones are repeating the trend for removing this as they tried to do in 2005, but thankfully we still have some phones that include it.. On the other side you’ll see speaker and microphone holes, and in the middle we’ve got the Micro-USB port for charging, data transfer, and connecting to the HiSuite software. Yeah, some of you may have preferred USB-C, but USB-C really has some compatibility issues at this time. Micro-USB is a little more reliable when it comes to finding a cable that works.. The right edge is where you’ll find the volume up/down toggle switch and the power/wake button. They’re very thin, but raised well enough to be easy to feel for while holding the device. Also note that inside the corners of this device are little shock absorption “air bags”. You can’t see them, but they’ll help reduce damage when the phone gets dropped.. On the left edge, you’ve got a tiny hole for popping out the SIM card & MicroSD expansion tray. The MicroSD tray doubles as a 2nd Nano SIM card tray too, so you can use two SIM cards with two different mobile phone plans in this phone.. At the top, we’ve got an 8 megapixel front facing camera along with the handset speaker. You can also see the seams where the screen is mounted to the aluminum body. Everything is really quite well put together.. The Honor 7X ships with Android 7.0 Nougat and Huawei’s custom EMUI 5.1. EMUI 5.1 replaces the default Android launcher and includes a few custom apps as well as a custom settings dialog. One big customization option is the ability to remove the standard “app drawer” icon in the bottom dock of the home launcher. This puts all of the app icons on the home screens along with the widgets. Personally I think this can simplify things a bit since you’ll only have to look in one place for everything on the phone. The Phone Manager app is another part of EMUI that Huawei has added. This is a good all-in-one spot to manage things like memory usage, battery, antivirus, data usage, blocked messages/callers, lock screen apps, etc. While there is a regular power saving mode in the Phone Manager, that mode will only get you about 2 days of usage without any background app activity or notifications sync. The Ultra Power Saver mode as seen above could give you over 6 days of usage! This mode only gives you access to 6 apps of your choosing and nothing has background push notifications. This is actually really nice as I can totally pick out only 6 apps that I would likely want access to for a long weekend away. EMUI 5.1 includes a good number of essential apps from Huawei. You’ve got an app for Themes, Health, a custom Calendar app, Notepad, File management, an email app, and others. The email app is okay, but it doesn’t read automatic configuration setup XML on Office 365 and Exchange Servers, so some accounts are a bit more tedious to set up. It’s also not as customizable as some other email apps like Blue Mail or Nine. Most of these custom apps have a rounded floating toolbar at the bottom and it looks quite nice. The buttons nicely have text labels that increase your cognitive ease of use and they’re located at the bottom of the screen where you can reach them with one hand while holding the phone. Those are two important usability aspects that most other Android app developers ignore. Huawei’s Music app is uniquely beautifully designed. It doesn’t have any cloud connectivity aspect like Google Play Music or other media players and that’s a good thing. Huawei’s Settings section has a lot of nice little customization options. You can change your home-screen style, choose from different navigation key layouts, enable fingerprint touch gestures, manage app permissions, and even create “App twins” which are secondary separate instances of specific apps that you can log into with a different account. With all of this Android customizing, we also have some stability problems. I’ve encountered app crashes from the camera, Xbox, Facebook, and others. Maybe a future update will make this a bit more stable.. When you plug the Honor 7X into a computer and enable data access, the internal storage shows up as you would expect, but a “CDROM” drive also shows up. This “HiSuite” separate disk includes some legal info on a PDF as well as a link to install the HiSuite software. You’ll have to enable your device to connect to this software in the settings in addition to allowing data access in the USB connection pop-up, but once you do, you’ll get a lot of great features for managing your phone from a PC. You can see all of the apps installed, uninstall the ones you don’t want and side-load other Android apps that you may have downloaded. You can sell all of the pictures, videos, and contacts on the device and of course transfer them to or from your PC. There’s a messaging section to where you can send & receive text messages just like we could do with some very old Windows Mobile 5-6 apps as well as some old Nokia Symbian desktop apps. The Outlook section even lets you do offline syncing of Outlook data between your phone and PC just like we used to do with PDAs and Palm Pilots in the 90’s. It’s really great to see a smartphone that’s not 100% dependent on cloud services (since those don’t last)! While you can’t control the device from the PC, you can see what’s on its screen and save screenshots. There are also backup, restore, update, and system recovery options as well as storage monitoring status bars. You can also display your phone’s screen on your computers screen in full screen mode. This is useful for projection demonstrations as everything that happens on your phone will show up on the larger screen. This HiSuite software is quite impressive and totally worth installing if you use a PC all day and really hate having to pick up your phone to respond to text messages or other notifications. All you have to do is look at the HiSuite application window instead.. The camera on the Honor 7X is actually quite acceptable for today’s smartphones. It doesn’t have image stabilization or multiple optical focal lengths to switch between, but the image quality that I’ve been seeing from this camera is about on par with average higher-end smartphone cameras. I know that’s not saying much, but I was actually impressed with how the fake depth of field blur handles highlights. I was expecting an even Gaussian blur, but Huawei actually put some thought into simulating DOF blurring and reproducing the circles of confusion as they are called.. Both the portrait mode and aperture simulation modes use the secondary 2Mp camera to calculate z-axis depth within the image. It guesstimates which parts are near and which parts are far and then blurs out the parts that are not within the focus point’s field.. The Aperture simulation mode doesn’t actually simulate the real function of an aperture at all. A camera’s aperture is meant to control the amount of light that’s being absorbed by the film or digital sensor at the time of exposure. It’s not possible to do that in software. Really it should be called a depth of field simulation, but it doesn’t even do that correctly. There’s a slider where you can adjust the aperture from f0.95 to f16. I assume it’s also trying to simulate a 35mm sensor frame because that has a huge effect on how the light focuses through the aperture size. Another thing that has a huge effect on the depth of field blurring is the focus point distance. The Huawei aperture simulation mode doesn’t seem to take that into account as a max blurring setting will have a similar effect whether the focus point subject is near or far.. All in all, software simulated depth of field really doesn’t look natural at all. I can spot these photos a mile away as the intricacies of natural bokeh just aren’t there. You can especially see this in the edges of any simulated bokeh image… not just Huawei, I’m talking the Google Pixel 2 and iPhone X, as well. One reason it’s just not possible to get it right is because you need the light to come from behind the subject. Blurring a 2D image with an automatically generated selection is going to cause bleed in the edges between the focus point and background/foreground. That’s if you can get the depth selections right and none of these DOF simulation cameras do. Doing this right, requires much more work.. The “Wide aperture effects” are non-destructive in the Huawei camera app and photo gallery. When viewing a photo, you’ll see a little grey circle icon next to the ones that were shot with depth information. You can then go into the effect editing mode and use the slider to change the amount of blur that’s applied to the image.. What’s more is that you can also change the focus point! In the above, I chose the background as the focus point, and the foreground becomes blurry. Even from this photo of a photo, you can see the messy edges of this effect around the bottom of Rosy’s elbow. Still, it’s nice to see a “Refocus” capability return to smartphones since Nokia had this option in the old Windows Phone days.. Besides the prominent, portrait and bokeh simulation modes at the top of the viewfinder, if you swipe the viewfinder to the right, you’ll get a whole page full of other modes and effects. You can switch to the Pro Photo mode with all the good old manual photography controls. You’ve got an HDR mode, Panorama, Light painting, Time-lapse, slow motion, and even a bunch of filters. Swiping to the left gives you all of the regular camera configuration settings such as resolution, grid overlay, shutter sound mute, touch to capture, object tracking, etc.. In the above gallery, you can see some full resolution sample photos taken with the rear camera. It’s fairly obvious which ones have the fake bokeh blurring effect. Edges are kind of messy even with very basic rectangular shapes like the Pocketnow mug seen in the first sample. In the second sample, whole swaths of telephone pole wires and trees just got erased. In the last sample, you can see that the subject and background are fairly far away and very close to being in the same focal plane, yet the fake wide aperture filter blurs the background much more than what would be physically possible with an actual wide aperture lens.. The front facing camera is pretty competitive with other much more expensive smartphones, too. Of course, its image quality isn’t as great as the rear-facing camera and there’s going to be a lot of water-color smattered noise reduction effects, but for simple social network sharing, that’s probably ok. Yes, there’s a fake bokeh filter here as well. See below gallery for a few samples.. Overall, the camera is totally acceptable with the possible exception of the camera software’s instability. I’ve encountered hangs, crashes, or extremely slow starts with Huawei’s camera app on the Honor 7X. Maybe this is due to all of the features that were packed into the camera software, or maybe it just needs some fine tuning and an update or two. Honestly, the Open Camera app seems to be a little more reliable, and that has the added advantage of supporting RAW DNG output, but without the special blur filters or other effects. Although, something seems to be saving the color channel information incorrectly in the RAW DNG files as everything that’s supposed to be red is purple or everything that’s supposed to be yellow is blue. The battery life on the Honor 7X is pretty excellent. You can easily go for more than one day in the normal mode with all of your notifications turned on. The 16nm Kirin 659 chipset seems to be very power efficient, and the 3340 mAh battery is a good amount of power. Huawei’s EMUI 5.1 has some very extensive power management features too.. The battery control panel in the settings allows you to clean up lock screen apps, optimize app power usage, switch to a low resolution power saving mode for the screen, enable a power saving mode that limits background app activity, and even enable an “Ultra power saving mode” that limits you to 6 apps of your choosing and extends battery life significantly.. I kept it in Ultra power saving mode all day and the battery level was still in the high 90s.. Of course, I was only doing email, calendar, maps, and some light web browsing, but the option to extend battery life so considerably is really nice to have. Honor 7X review, we’ve used the device for more than a week.. At $200, the Huawei Honor 7X is a beautiful phone! Above you can see it next to some other fairly well-received smartphones in the same $200 price range; the Moto G5 Plus and Nokia 6. Both of those phones seem far more basic and even clunky looking next to the Honor 7X. The Huawei Honor 7X gives you a lot of bang for you buck. The large screen with very thin bezels along with the thin aluminum body make it look and feel like a much more expensive phone.. Some may criticize the Honor 7X for its lack of USB-C charging port, but who cares? It’s just a charging/data port. You’re not going to be plugging in external monitors or eGPU hardware here. Yes, there are plenty of things that could be better, but you’re going to have to pay more for those things. The Honor 7X is a nice balance between budget friendly pricing and modern high-end style features..

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus. If you can't stand the sight of ugly bezels, but don't want to shell out big bucks for a phone with an 18:9 aspect ration, the new Huawei Honor 7X could provide the answer.. PCMag reviews products independently , but we may earn affiliate commissions from buying links on this page. "Death to bezels" is the motto of 2017. From the Apple iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy S8 to the LG V30, the 18:9 aspect ratio is all the rage for flagship phones, eliminating the unsightly border around your phone in favor of maximizing screen real estate. But what if you want a beautiful, edge-to-edge screen without emptying your wallet?. Huawei may have the answer with the Honor 7X. It's the successor Honor 6X , and w hen we reviewed that phone, we were impressed by its solid performance, dual-camera capabilities, and attractive build. The Honor 7X continues that tradition by putting a tall and narrow, 5.93-inch display in a 5.5-inch metal unibody (available in sleek black, blue, or gold). That makes the phone 0.1 inches narrower and 0.3 inches shorter than the iPhone 8 Plus. Huawei also says the phone's corners have been reinforced for increased protection against drops, which is handy if you don't want to cover it up with a case.. vAside from making it easier to hold and allowing for more content to be displayed on the screen, the 7X has features for easier usability, such as launching into Split-screen mode with the push of a button, letting you run two different, compatible apps side by side. It can also sharpen images during the day for better readability and tint to a warmer color at night to put less strain on your eyes.. The design retains the fingerprint sensor by moving it from the bottom bezel to the back, similar to the OnePlus 5T. It also keeps the dual-camera sensors from the 6X with a 16-megapixel and 2-megapixel rear sensors. The dual-sensor setup promises to take vivid, high-definition photos with good low-light capabilities and supports a Portrait mode. There's an 8-megapixel selfie camera that can adjust the depth of field. When we tested the Honor 6X, we found that the rear camera took decent low-light shots for a midrange phone, besting the Moto G5 Plus. We'll be putting the Honor 7X to the test against the Moto X4, which also has a dual-camera setup.. Android Phone Running Out of Juice? Try Huawei's Mate 9. Android Phone Running Out of Juice? Try Huawei's Mate 9. The 7X is powered by a Kirin 659 processor with 4GB of RAM, which should put it on par with Snapdragon 630-powered devices like the Motorola Moto X4 , and allow for smooth performance and solid gaming capabilities. Huawei is emphasizing a partnership with Gameloft to optimize Modern Combat Versus and take advantage of gaming in the 18:9 aspect ratio.. Under the hood, you have 32GB or 64GB of internal storage, plus expandable storage up to 256GB. There's also a large 3,340mAh battery, which is a tad bigger than the OnePlus 5T's 3,300mAh battery. Huawei claims it can last for 12 hours of video playback, but we'll be subjecting it to our own grueling battery rundown test when we get a review unit.. The Honor 7X is getting a launch event on Dec. 5, so stay tuned for more details on pricing and availability, as well as our hands on.. Microsoft Only Sold 1,639 Xbox One X at Japan Launch.

This phone is available in 32 GB, 64 GB storage variants.. Huawei Honor 7x (64 GB): Pros & Cons. Good Stuff Premium build quality evokes a flagship feel Can take portrait shots using the dual rear cameras Wi-Fi bridge feature is an added boon Bad Stuff Absence of a dedicated microSD card slot Slightly big for single-handed operation. Honor 7X: An honourable mid-range phone. Honor, a subsidiary of the world’s largest telecommunication equipment manufacturer Huawei, launched yet another budget masterpiece: the Honor 7X. The Honor 7X is a successor to the Honor 6X which was released earlier this year. The Honor 6X was an excellent smartphone, and you can read more about it here. The Honor 7X does an excellent job of carrying on the company’s legacy of creating high-powered, reasonably priced devices. Without further ado, let’s take a look at what the Honor 7X is all about. Honor 7X: Design and Build Quality. The sturdy all-metal body is one of the first things that got me hooked on the Honor 7X. The construction is solid, sturdy and has a premium feel to it. The 2.5D glass transitions seamlessly into the aluminium chassis. The dual-cameras and LED flash are colinear with the top antenna band that runs across the back panel. The fingerprint scanner sits towards the centre of the rear panel, underneath the dual cameras. The bottom edge houses the 3.5mm headphone jack, micro USB port and the loudspeaker. The volume rockers and button occupy the right edge and the SIM card tray blends perfectly into the left edge.. I subjected the Honor 7X to some light drops from varying heights, and I’m happy to say that the body held its own, without so much as a scratch. It lacks any form of water resistance, so I’d recommend keeping it away from moisture. One-handed operation can be a little tricky owing to the large screen size, but Huawei has you covered as the Honor 7X can be run in one-handed mode, which I’ll explain in detail in a bit. My only grievance with the body is the fact that it’s a fingerprint magnet and smudges easily. The situation is easily remedied by carrying a microfiber cloth.. The Honor 7X rocks a 5.93-inch IPS LCD panel with a resolution of 2060x1080. The ‘FullView’ display (which is the company’s branding for less-bezel displays) has an aspect ratio of 18:9, and it looks beautiful. The panel is sufficiently bright, and legibility under direct sunlight is manageable. The colour accuracy of the panel is on par with that of other LCD panels and does an excellent job of not oversaturating colours and images. The 1080p version of the 2006 movie A Scanner Darkly was the video of my choice to test HD content, and I can state that the experience was nothing short of mind-blowing, at least for the price. The Honor 7X lets you take advantage of its FullView display by running apps at an 18:9 aspect ratio. Most apps work just fine, barring a few games such as Clash Royale, which has not been optimized yet.. One of the most notable features of the display is that its colour temperature can be fine-tuned to your requirement. The UI is a spherical colour palette with three radial edges representing primary colours namely red, green and blue. A point in the palette lets you select the tint of the panel. By default, the point is set at the centre and two other presets namely Warm and Cool can also be selected. The Warm preset gives the panel a yellowish tint and the Cold preset a bluish tinge.The Honor 7X also includes an “Eye Comfort” mode which filters out blue light in an attempt to reduce eye strain. The feature comes in handy at night or during prolonged viewing. The mode can also be triggered automatically at a specific time of the day, from within the settings. Personally, I found it handy while using the Honor 7X in a pitch black environment and could squeeze a few more minutes of usage before my head begins to hurt.. Huawei was one of the first companies to introduce the concept of dual cameras in smartphones, starting with the Huawei P10. The technology has evolved and its progress is visible with the dual 16+2-megapixel primary camera on the Honor 7X. The 16-megapixel lens acts as the primary image sensor and the 2-megapixel lens as the depth sensor. The depth sensor comes in handy to create a depth of field effect a.k.a bokeh effect. The secondary sensor, however, is not operational at all times and is available only in a few modes such as Portrait Mode and Wide Aperture Mode. Some prominent features present in higher-end Huawei phones are stripped away, but we’re not complaining. The camera's performance is still on point and arguably better than most similarly priced devices. I’d go as far as saying that the Honor 7X’s camera can give some affordable flagship devices such as the Nokia 8 a run for their money. Despite the absence of a dual-tone LED flash, low-light images retain most of their clarity and have minimal noise.. The camera UI is easy to use and offers a variety of features to help you capture the perfect image. The portrait mode is ideal for photos shot between a distance ranging from 0.5-2m. A depth of field effect is applied to the image, and facial features are enhanced, both of which can be fine-tuned later in the image gallery. The Wide Aperture mode creates a bokeh effect at the desired point in an image. The Pro Mode lets you fine-tune the ISO, white balance, exposure and other parameters, but I’d recommend leaving it be unless you know what you’re doing. There are a lot of additional features as well, but I’m going to have to cut it short, as it would take me a long time to get into each one of them in depth. I’ll include some screenshots of some of the camera UI features, so that you may get a rough idea of what the Honor 7X is capable of.. The 8-megapixel secondary camera is capable of capturing high-quality selfies. The portrait mode is also available in the secondary camera, so you can capture that perfect selfie which looks like it has been taken from a more powerful camera. (I’m serious, one person thought that it was shot from a DSLR). You can even add Snapchat like filters to your photos (yeah the ones with animals). The beauty mode does what the name indicates, makes you beautiful. The skin tone is made a few hues lighter and blemishes, if any, are masked. The secondary camera also lets you shoot in panorama mode, allowing you get that perfect group selfie you’ve been looking for. The front camera lacks an LED flash and illuminates the screen to a bright white, to aid in low light photography, which is what most high-end phones do. Results can vary according to ambient factors such as location and the source of illumination.. The Honor 7X is powered by an octa-core Hisilicon Kirin 659 chip with four cores clocked at 2.36GHz, and the other four clocked at 1.7GHz. I had high expectations from the Honor 7X, given that HiSilicon is also a Huawei subsidiary. The Kirin 659 has been tweaked to perfection to sync up with the performance needs of Honor 7X. Navigation through the menus and the user interface was smooth, absent of any stutter or lag. The Honor 7X could handle most of the games I threw at it, namely Asphalt 8: Airborne, Modern Combat 5 and Clash Royale. All games ran flawlessly at maximum settings (although there isn’t much to tweak in Clash Royale). I’ve included the results of some benchmarks that I ran on the Honor 7X and how it fares compared to other devices. I was able to run two apps simultaneously in the split screen mode without any noticeable lag in either of the apps. Switching between the apps was instantaneous and both the running apps performed exactly how they would if ran separately. The rear-mounted fingerprint scanner was both accurate and precise and almost never failed to correctly identify my input.. Moving on to the part that baffled me the most; the Bluetooth functionality of the Honor 7X. I’m going to go ahead and say that it is an absolute mess. I was forced to restart the device a few times after I attempted to switch Bluetooth on. At times, file transfers over Bluetooth would flat out fail, forcing me to use a third party file sharing software. I’m hoping that Huawei addresses this issue with an OTA update in the future. The disappointing Bluetooth performance was the only roadblock in my otherwise smooth Honor 7X experience. Other wireless data transfer means were much better, thankfully. The Wi-Fi radio managed to catch a strong signal where my other device got only one bar. I was hoping for a 5GHz Wi-Fi radio, but the Honor 7X is devoid of one. The Wi-Fi bridge functionality of the Honor 7X lets you share your device's Wi-Fi connection with up to 4 other clients, something that might come in handy if you desperately need an internet connection in a faraway corner of the room, away from the router.. The network reception of the Honor 7X was excellent, and I could get connectivity at locations where several devices failed to get any. The quality of audio over a VoLTE network was audibly better than that over a traditional 2G medium. The earpiece and loudspeaker were sufficiently loud and I could hear the caller even in a relatively loud environment. The throughput over mobile data hit up to 36Mbps at 4 AM in the morning, tested over two separate networks.. The Honor 7X runs Android Nougat 7.0 out of the box, customized with Huawei’s in-house Android fork, Emotions UI (EMUI) 5.1. EMUI is easily one of the most feature-rich Android forks out there and it’ll almost make you forget that it takes up a whopping 12GB of the internal storage. EMUI has the complete arsenal of tools a user would need to get day-to-day tasks done quickly. The included file manager is easy to use and helps you find the file you need without going through a dozen folders first. You can even create a password-protected folder for your sensitive data. Individual apps can be locked with a PIN/pattern/password using the App Lock feature. For the people constantly switching between identities, the App Clone feature lets you run two separate, independent instances of the same app.. EMUI 5.1 lets you choose if you want your all your apps scattered over the home screen or organized neatly in an app drawer (this feature was only added earlier this year after a lot of Indian users wanted a dedicated app drawer). The cache and memory management of the Honor 7X will ensure that no pesky background apps will hog your precious resources. The cache can be cleaned with the click of a button in the Phone Manager, and all background activity can be restricted to eke out a few extra ergs out of the battery. The inbuilt antivirus is all you’ll need to protect your device from malicious apps, and annoying “your phone software is outdated, click here to download totallynotavirus.apk to make your phone 700 percent faster, gain the ability to levitate and attain nirvana” popups.. One of the features I loved about EMUI (and used extensively during this review) is the rolling screenshot feature. It lets you capture an entire webpage by automatically scrolling and capturing the contents on a real-time basis and stitching in into one image. The screen recording function is also neat, allowing you to easily make a video showing your mom how to disable media downloads on WhatsApp. As mentioned earlier, EMUI 5.1 has a one-handed mode, which will come in handy (geddit? geddit?) for people with small hands. The mode can be toggled by dragging the home button to the recent apps button. A “Floating Dock” is also included, which emulates the functionalities of the home/back/recent apps keys and can be placed at any location you choose. You can even clean the device cache using the Floating Dock, to get that little extra punch. The Honor 7X comes with pre-installed games, which you can try for all of ten minutes before being prompted to buy them. I promptly uninstalled the games, obviously.. The Honor 7X’s 3,340mAh Li-Po battery might not seem like a lot on paper compared to the 4,000mAh units we’re used to seeing in other similarly priced devices, but I managed to get a lot more out of it than I expected. I could squeeze out a day and a half worth of performance out of it with about 5 hours of screen time with auto brightness switched on. On full brightness, I got around 4 hours of screen time and 20 hours of operation. Another neat feature in the Honor 7X is the “Ultra Power Saving” mode, which shuts off all background activity and lets you run only the dialer, emergency button, contacts, messaging and two apps of your choosing. Sadly, screenshots (and most of the other functionalities) are disabled in the mode, so I can’t show you how it looks. The excellent battery life can also be attributed to the excellent software optimization and just how well EMUI 5.1 works to get the most out of it.. Of all the devices I’ve reviewed so far, the Honor 7X is by far the best one I’ve laid my hands on. I’ve already recommended the Honor 7X to several people looking to buy a new phone as I can personally vouch for its performance. At a retail price of Rs.12,999, The Honor 7X offers excellent value for money. I’d recommend getting yours quickly as the Honor 7X is expected to disappear off the shelves much like its predecessor, the Honor 6X. The device will be available exclusively via flash sale, so keep an eye out on our website so that stay up to date with the sales. The Honor 7X is a testament to the technological prowess of Huawei and a good indication of why they're one of the best smartphone manufacturers in the world.. As a follow-up to the Honor 6x, Chinese smartphone manufacturer Huawei announced the release of the Honor 7x. It boasts of a better camera, a better processor and more RAM, compared to the 6x. The device promises exciting features at an affordable price. It has a sturdy, all-metal body, which makes the device robust.. The Huawei Honor 7x sports a 5.9-inch IPS LCD panel with a resolution of 1920x1080 (~403 ppi pixel density). The primary cameras are a dual 16+2-megapixels with PDAF, LED flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR and panorama and can record full HD videos at 30 fps. The secondary camera is 8-megapixels with LED flash and can record full HD videos at 30 fps.. The Huawei Honor 7x is powered by an octa-core Hisilicon Kirin 670 processor with four cores clocked at 2.2Ghz and four cores clocked at 2.0GHz. The Kirin 659 is built on a 12nm manufacturing process, which makes it more efficient. It comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage respectively, depending on the variant. The internal storage can further be expanded up to 256GB via microSD card. The battery is a 3,340mAh Li-pol unit, which is slowly becoming a standard among most Chinese OEMs. It also features a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. It is expected to run Android Nougat 7.1.1 out of the box, customised with Huawei's EMUI 8.0.. The Huawei Honor 7x is a dual SIM phone with both slots compatible with 4G and VoLTE. Other connectivity features 802.11 b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, A-GPS, GLONASS and a USB Type-C port for charging and data transfer. Other sensors on the device include a light sensor, a. proximity sensor, a compass, gyroscope and an accelerometer. The device is excellent value for money at its price.

The phone is a pleasure to hold. Not only that, but Honor has really managed to step up its game when it comes to materials and build quality.. We've come to accept Honor devices as being great value. Relying on proven technology from its parent company Huawei, the Chinese brand has been consistently focused on bringing very good specs at tempting prices. That's no easy task, yet Honor makes it seem almost effortlessly natural at this point, with devices like the Honor 7X.. Huawei's current Mate lineup already offers great value in the high-end segment, with the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro, as well as in the large screen mid-range, in the face of the Mate 10 Lite.. However, it doesn't really take more than a quick specs comparison to see that the Honor is positioning the 7X as an almost identical offer, both hardware and design-wise and at a price point lower than the 350 euro or so the Mate 10 Lite sells for.. Sure, you might be missing out on some selfie extras and a few other small details here and there, but in the US, Honor 7X is launching at just $200 - a whole $50 less than its Honor 6X predecessor at launch. Europe is getting less of a bargain, but still not that terrible.. Of course, no phone is without its faults. We would have loved to see a USB Type-C slot on the Honor 7X. While at it, NFC support to power contactless payments would have been a nice touch as well. Still, in the grand scheme of things, a lesser known brand seems to be enough to save you a pretty penny on some excellent Huawei hardware and software package. A deal we would gladly take any day of the week.. A simple, sturdy, two-piece cardboard box - that's what we like to see from value-conscious devices and that's exactly what the Honor 7X ships in. Nothing too fancy, but we do dig the greenish-blue color Honor went with. It really makes it stand out.. Removing the top part reveals a single compartment that only houses a wall charger and USB cable. Unfortunately, it's the microUSB type and not the newer, reversible Type-C port. The charger is rated at 10W or 2A@5V, which coincidentally is the maximum power the Honor 7X will charge at.. A metal unibody and a glass front - it might be overused, yes, but we still think it's a timeless look. The Honor 7X pulls it off magnificently in every aspect and we'll enjoy every bit of it, before the iPhone-inspired wireless charging-friendly devices come pouring in.. The Honor 7X has extremely flush and natural curves, quite reminiscent of an iPhone 7, or a couple of its predecessors.. The phone barely flexes under pressure and feels as solid as a rock. Past Honor devices have always been sturdy in their own right. This frame, however, is one of the sturdiest we've ever seen on a phone of this price range.. Of course, on the flip side of things, a metal back does mean no wireless charging and requires the presence of antenna lines. The latter, however, are blended in really well with the rest of the body and this is true regardless of the finish you choose - blue, gold or black.. The only other exterior segment on the Honor 7X is a 2.5D front glass, which tucks away neatly into the frame itself, which is another really pleasant design choice. It's a Gorilla Glass but Honor doesn't reveal which generation.. Whatever the glass may be, the better part of the surface underneath it is occupied by a trendy new extra-wide, 5.9-inch, 18:9 panel. We really appreciate Honor stuck with FullHD, instead of saving a few bucks by going with a lower resolution. The side bezels around the panel are quite thin, but nothing we would consider bezel-less. The top and bottom chins are quite reasonably sized as well.. Honor 7X trendy new ultra-wide display. Besides the selfie camera and speaker, the top one also houses a notification LED. The bottom one only has an Honor logo printed on the underlying surface in a very Huawei fashion.. On the left side of the phone there is a single tray that houses a regular and hybrid SIM slot on the Dual-SIM model, or substitutes the latter for a dedicated microSD one.. On the opposite side - a volume rocker near the top and a power button beneath that. Both easy to reach, "click-y" and well defined.. Honor 7X top and bottom sides. The top of the Honor 7X is pretty empty, save for a tiny hole for a secondary noise-cancelling microphone. On the bottom - the microSD port, we already whined about along with the single speaker. In all fairness, we can't realistically expect a stereo setup at this price point.. Thankfully, what is included is a good old 3.5mm audio jack.. A rear-mounted fingerprint reader is also part of the mix. In keeping with its solid reputation in this area, Huawei equipped the Honor 7X with a very snappy and accurate scanner. Naturally, it is always-on and can unlock the phone from standby. Lab tests - display and audio quality, battery life, speaker loudness.

Huawei Honor 7X review: Better display, camera and build quality makes it a great challenger to the Xiaomi Mi A1. The Huawei Honor 7X shocked us with its pricing when the same was announced at the brand’s grand launch in London , alongside the Honor V10 (or View 10) flagship.. The Huawei Honor 7X Image: tech2/Rehan Hooda. Having reviewed the Honor 9i , there appears to be very little that has changed, both internally and cosmetically, when it comes to design. The 7X is cheaper than the 9i,. but it also sacrifices the front facing dual-camera and opts for a smaller battery unit.. With that said, the Honor 7X was built for a reason and if you have read my first impressions , it is easy to conclude that Honor has the Xiaomi Mi A1 in its crosshairs.. After using the Honor 7X for a couple of weeks, it’s clear that this is indeed Huawei’s version of the Mi A1. But as with every Honor smartphone out there, it’s always the software updates that are the sore point. Even before diving into the review, I can tell you right now that if you're particular about firmware updates and security, you will be happier with Mi A1. The Honor 7X seems to have everything else covered.. For a smartphone that is priced at Rs 15,999 (Rs 12,999 for the 32 GB storage variant), the Huawei Honor 7X offers stunning build quality that feels more mid-range than budget.. The Huawei Honor 7X looks and feels premium. The design still looks very similar to the higher-priced Honor 9i, but with a few differences. There is now an ‘Honor’ branding on the bottom chin and the camera layout on the rear consists of two separate lenses mounted horizontally. Thankfully, the change in layout is only cosmetic and the performance of the cheaper 7x appears identical to that of the 9i, more about this in the Camera section.. Design and build quality will set new benchmarks for the budget smartphone segment. The fit and finish are pretty good and the 7X is the only device priced this low that will get you a premium-looking, all-metal unibody design with a polished 2.5D curved glass on the front.. The 'Honor' branding on the chin. Truly, the design of the Honor 7X makes the slimmer Mi A1 with its chunky bezels and flat glass look like it was designed in 2016.. While the matte finish on the back feels cold and pleasant to hold, it quickly turns into a mess just like Honor 9i did.. There is something about the coating on the Honor 9i and the 7X that makes them a fingerprint magnet. Despite cleaning it from time to time, it took mere seconds for the device to catch new prints, which made for a smudgy mess of a body. Honor really needs to look into this as it is hard to wipe off these prints, especially on the black model. My solution? Get the model with the blue finish.. With a dual camera setup on the rear and a capable Kirin chipset inside, the only reason I marked the Honor 7X below the 9i is due to the lack of the dual front-camera.. Everything inside pretty much remains the same as on the Honor 9i.. You get a 5.9-inch Full HD+ Full View display on the front covered with a 2.5D screen. Inside, there is a Huawei HiSilicon Kirin 659 SoC having an octa-core processor with four Cortex A53 cores clocked at 2.36 GHz and the other four clocked at a lower 1.7 GHz for handling less-demanding tasks.. Paired with the processor is 4 GB RAM and 64 GB of internal storage. Honor also offers a 4 GB RAM and 32 GB storage model. Both offer storage expansion using a hybrid microSD card slot. However, the 7X will get you more bang for your buck here as it supports cards of up to 256 GB, instead of the 128 GB available on the Xiaomi Mi A1.. As for the cameras, the Honor 7X will get you a dual 16 MP + 2 MP camera setup on the rear, with an 8 MP camera on the front for selfie duty.. Connectivity options include a 4G+, 4G, 3G and 2G bands. There’s Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n (2.5/5 GHz Wi-Fi), GPS/AGPS, GLONASS, Wi-Fi Direct, microUSB v2.0, dual SIM slots and USB OTG support.. The handset runs Android 7.0 Nougat and is powered by a 3,340 mAh battery.. The display on the Honor 7X is identical to the unit on the Honor 9i. Which means it goes from edge to edge on the sides and bezel to bezel at the top and the bottom.. The display is sharp and features a high, 407 PPI pixel density, which makes reading text even at the smallest font setting clear on this large, 5.9-inch unit.. That display sure looks vibrant, but can be adjusted to suite your preferences in Settings. The large FHD+ display is clearly the highlight of the smartphone and is the most important differentiating factor between the Xiaomi Mi A1 and itself, the second factor is, of course, the software.. The displays on the 7x and 9i appear identical and noticed that I had the same problems with the 7x's display that I had with the 9i.. There is a problem with the brightness levels dropping as the viewing angles get steeper. The brightness levels decrease drastically when you view the display off centre. It keeps dropping as the viewing angles get steeper, and once placed on your desk, it’s hard to tell if the display is set to the maximum brightness setting as it looks very dim. As explained in my Honor 9i review, it’s not the display, but simply the manner in which the screen above it is set up. intact when viewed from different angles.. From the front, things look alright. Overall, the display looks great and is clearly one of the best ones I have seen in the budget smartphone segment so far, producing natural-looking colours without any noticeable gradients, along with adequate brightness levels.. It’s 2017 and with every passing month, expectations for the next best version of Android increase. While I was happy to see budget-like software performance onboard the 9i, a month later, it feels a bit lacking.. It’s the same old EMUI 5.1 experience we have gotten used to for a few months now and it still packs in Android 7.0 Nougat inside. To make things worse, the security patch was last updated in October and there have been no updates till. date (December, as of this writing).. Huawei's EMUI feels heavy but brings a level of customisation not available on stock Android. While Huawei promises to deliver Android 8.0 Oreo, users clearly will only be left hanging with Nougat as the same has yet to make it to the Honor 8 Pro (which was launched in July), the company’s current flagship until the View 10 arrives. We have yet to receive any official confirmation from Huawei about the roll-out of software updates.. An outdated version of Android is no excuse for a smartphone launched in Q4 2017. The Mi A1 has received plenty of updates so far and even comes with the latest security patches. Since it comes with Google’s Android One inside, update release cycles are expected to be quicker than the usual, which seems like the right route for a budget smartphone.. While things sure look bleak for Honor right now, the level of software customisations still gives the Honor 7X the edge, I think.. Want to change the saturation or hue of the display? Sorry, the Mi A1 cannot do that. Need to switch to a resolution-changing battery-saver mode? Sorry, the Mi A1 can’t do that either. Clearly, stock Android may not necessarily be the best approach at times. But that’s no excuse for Honor to be stuck on outdated core software.. The Kirin 659 inside the Honor 7X packs in quite a punch for a budget smartphone SoC. Clocked at 2.3 GHz it also happens to be one of the faster SoCs on the block, which meant that most of the benchmarks saw it defeat the Mi A1,. which features a tried and tested Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 SoC.. Huawei’s EMUI did feel a bit heavy for once, with the software showcasing minor, but noticeable hiccups in daily use. These were usually limited to swipe action in the user interface and not when multitasking between apps.. Gaming performance was great, save for the choppy experience I had with Breakneck. While graphically demanding games like Asphalt Xtreme ran smoothly at HDPI and ‘Best Quality’ settings for textures, others like the popular Breakneck by PikPok stuttered all the way through. Indeed, this seems like a game-specific issue as the rest of the games I tested ran smoothly without any problems.. Huawei Honor 7X Performance Benchmarks Infogram. The smartphone did warm up during extended gaming sessions and when using the camera for a long time but was not hot enough for me to shut down the app. Audio quality while listening to music on the headphones was decent and drifted more towards the bass notes. The audio through the speaker sounded a bit tinny. It was just not loud enough to place a call on speaker unless I was in a really quiet room.. the speaker near my ear to listen to callers outdoors (with plenty of ambient noise). The same can be said about the receiver, which was a bit too low on volume. Hopefully, these can be fixed in future firmware updates. Camera: 7.5/10 Camera performance on the Honor 7X was decent at best. Unlike the Honor 9i, which gets you a quad-camera setup, the Honor 7X does with a dual camera setup with a 16 MP + 2 MP unit on the rear and a single 8 MP camera on the front.. I so wanted to scribble a 'minion' around those camera rings. In daylight scenarios, the rear camera was quick to focus and shoot both standard and portrait images with an enhanced depth of field. The photographs looked vibrant and showcased plenty of sharpness as well. The images overall look a lot brighter than those on the Mi A1. However, pixel-peeping into these images revealed that only the edges are sharpened. Textures are smudged over and there is a significant loss of detail. But this is noticeable only if you are in the habit of zooming into your pictures. Else, it’s hard to tell if there is a problem at 50-60 percent crop. All photographs were shot in the auto mode using the default settings.. The camera's UI is very user-friendly. Honor does let you tweak the sharpness levels in the camera app, which also happens to come with a user-friendly UI. In low-light situations, things did not turn out too well. The rear camera had a hard time focusing on subjects, objects or even a street scene under street lighting. This was a problem even in dim lighting. There was little noise in these photographs, which is surprising, but it all came at the cost of details, making most photos look like paintings. Partially responsible for this was also the sluggish autofocus system. The low light images were decent enough for Instagram, but nothing else.. Indoors, things were a bit better when it came to autofocus, but the camera again, in an attempt to reduce noise, killed most of the details.. The same was the problem with portrait mode photos. It’s hard to tell what Huawei did so differently in terms of software as the hardware seemed identical to the unit on the Honor 9i. in the portrait mode was not really accurate, and the details were decent only in daylight. Switch to indoor lighting and those numbers drop a bit. These were still better than the ones we got with Mi A1, however.. Huawei uses software to deliver the Portrait mode because it lacks a secondary camera to get depth data. decent enough to post on social media. Low light selfies (Portrait or standard) using the screen flash were below average.. Video recording with the phone maxing out at FHD was passable, but showcased a lot of luminance noise.. pain when it comes to the Honor 7X. With no quick charging facility, it took well over two hours to charge the 3,340 mAh battery.. Huawei Honor 7X saw an average performance on our standard PC Mark Work 2.0 Battery Life test.. Day to day usage saw me get through a day of use, with little juice left at the end of the workday. Huawei sure could have done better considering the size of the battery. Strangely, the Honor 7X didn’t last as long as the Honor 9i here. Blame it on the software optimisations or the battery used, but it did feel a bit lacking considering the capacity of the battery.. At Rs 13,999 Xiaomi gets you the same build quality, with more bezels, a similar display (although not as tall) and better battery life thanks to its compact package.. The Mi A1 also offers more storage (64 GB), smoother software and faster updates all at a price point that is Rs 1,000 over the base price of the Honor 7X, which starts at Rs 12,999. The 64 GB storage option of the Honor 7X is a lot pricier at Rs 15,999 given that it’s just a storage bump and nothing else.. A better all-round package compared to the Xiaomi Mi A1. Despite the odd pricing between storage options, the. going for it, including it’s 18:9 display and slightly better CPU performance (not GPU) in comparison to the Xiaomi Mi A1. But then again, the build quality and camera performance (in daylight at least) stand out, making it a better choice over the Xiaomi Mi A1. If you ask me, the 32 GB storage version (priced at Rs 12,999) is quite the. deal even when compared to a high-end version of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 .. The Huawei Honor 7X (64GB, 4GB RAM) features a 5.93-inch FHD display with a resolution of 1080 x 2160 pixels and is powered by a 2.36GHz + 1.7GHz octa core processor and has 4GB of RAM. It comes with 64GB of inbuilt storage, expandable upto 256GB and has a 16.0 + 2.0-megapixel rear camera and 8.0-megapixel front camera. It comes with Android 7.0 + EMUI 5.1 Nougat OS and support a 3340mAh battery capacity with 3G & 4G.. Android 7.0 + EMUI 5.1 Nougat. 75.3 x 7.6 x 156.5 mm.

Honor 7X Review, specification, features and Best Price in India. Huawei’s sub-brand Honor to unveil a new smartphone, labelled as the Honor 7X, in India. The Android-powered smartphone has already been launched in China and is the successor of Honor 6X. The highlight of Honor 7X is its full vision display and dual-rear cameras. In terms of specification, the Honor 7X includes a full-screen full HD+ 5.93-inch (1080×2160 pixels) curved display and is powered HiSilicon Kirin 659 SoC, an Octa-core Cortex-A53 processor with one 2.36GHz four-core performance cluster and another 1.7GHz power cluster, under the metal unibody design. The processor is backed by 4GB of RAM and 32GB storage. For photography, the Honor 7X features a duo of 16MP and 2MP cameras at the back and an 8MP camera on the front. In addition to that, the back camera has LED flash and portrait mode. The dual-hybrid sim setup phone runs on the Android Nougat OS out of the box and houses a 3340mAh battery, to keep the phone up and running. The fingerprint sensor is placed on the rear panel and the connectivity options on the same comprise of 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1 LE and GPS / GLONASS. The Honor 7X will sell in India in three color option - Aurora Blue, Gold, and Black, and expected to fall at a starting price of Rs. You can subscribe to Smartprix notification to get the instant update on its launch and all the news surrounding Honor 7X.. The Honor 7X packs a 5.9" IPS LCD with an 18:9 aspect ratio, quite similar to the one on the Mate 10 Lite. It is a very decent panel and we particularly appreciate Honor hasn't gone for a lower than 1080p resolution. This makes for a pixel density of 407ppi, perfectly sharp by modern standards. The Huawei Honor 7X audio output is nicely accurate both with an active external amplifier and with a pair of headphones.. Solid build quality Great ultra-wide display Solid battery life Dependable overall performance Flexible and feature-rich EMUI 5.1 android ROM. No NFC or 5GHz Wi-Fi Support No fast charging. The Honor 7X looks to have all the makings of a great mid-range smartphone, and the ability to be able to get an 18:9 screen with so much potential is a cherry on the cake. That being said, the smartphone does look attractive with its aluminum chassis which might not be as pleasant as the glass back on other flagship smartphones. The fingerprint sensor is located on the rear of the handset, and we found it easy to reach when holding the phone. The fingerprint sensor is quick to identify the touch input and unlocks in a jiffy.. Vibrant 18:9 display Premium feel metal design. One storage option Doesn't use USB-C. The Honor 7X is shaping up like an easy phone to recommend. $200 gets you a solid, good-looking phone, with a tall, 18:9 screen and peppy performance. EMUI 5.1 feels rather tired and a bit cartoonish, but the functionality and performance within give the user much customization and plenty of speed in day-to-day tasks. As for the camera, it does seem promising, but we'll have to test it further before we give it our final verdict.. Great looks and build quality 18:9 screen Fluid, prompt performance. No USB-C No fast charging Camera becomes very temperamental in low-light. The general design language of the Honor 7X reminds us of the Huawei P10, the high-end phone that was launched at MWC 2017 in February. It uses a similar type of metal design, and there are antenna slits in the back, which are relatively discreet. The fingerprint reader is placed in a natural position, and it is effortless to find it to unlock the phone, although it is placed in the back of the phone.. Good build quality Large display Functional bokeh camera Aggressively priced. It's an awesome phone guys believe me. What a beauty!!!! Touch is so smooth like butter. Battery also lasts for a day. Hybrid slot Battery should be above 4k mah. for those who love phone looks & camera. no gyroscope sensor no fast charging battery capacity usb port.

The Huawei Honor 7X is an excellent unlocked phone that boasts flagship-level features at an affordable $200 price.. Editor Rating: Excellent (4.0) Dec 20, 2017. No dual-band Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth 5.0, or USB-C. The Huawei Honor 7X is a promising unlocked phone that boasts flagship-level features at an affordable $200 price.. There's never been a better time to be shopping for a new phone on a budget. The Huawei Honor 7X, for instance, brings flagship-level features to buyers who wouldn't dream of spending $700-plus on a new device. For $199, the 7X gets you an 18:9 edge-to-edge display that maximizes screen real estate and minimizes bezel. You also get a sleek aluminum unibody build, solid specs, and a capable pair of rear cameras. The Motorola Moto G5 Plus remains our Editors' Choice in this price range thanks to longer battery life and a lighter software layer, bu the Honor 7X is a worthy alternative if you prefer its form factor.. The Honor 7X departs from the Honor 6X in a few ways. While the phones share a metal unibody design, the 5.9-inch 7X is tall and narrow, measuring 6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and 5.8 ounces. That's nearly identical to the 6-inch OnePlus 5T (6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 5.7 ounces), and you get much more screen space than the similarly sized 5.2-inch G5 Plus (5.9 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces).. View All 8 Photos in Gallery. I found it easy to reach across the phone, though stretching your fingers from top to bottom is more of a challenge. You do get quite a few customizable one-handed modes that let you shrink the screen, move the keyboard to the right or left, or place a floating navigation dock anywhere you want, so no matter your hand size you shouldn't have much trouble.. The fingerprint sensor is on the back, toward the middle, and within easy reach of your index finger. The camera sensors are in the top right corner, so there's little chance you'll smudge the lenses when unlocking the phone. A micro USB charging port is on the bottom, which is a bit of a bummer if you're hoping to make the switch to USB-C.. The front of the phone is home to a 5.9-inch, 2,160-by-1,080-pixel screen. The 407ppi screen isn't as dense as the G5 Plus (424 pixels per inch), but I wasn't able to see any pixelation. Color accuracy is solid, and Huawei's Settings menu is loaded with customization options to change screen temperature and color saturation. By default, the 7X has rich, saturated colors that look like they're pressed up against the screen, similar to the Apple iPhone X. Viewing angles are great, but screen brightness could be higher. And the 7X is dimmer than the 6X, so it's a bit harder to see outdoors under direct sunlight.. As with other 18:9 phones, there are some display scaling issues. Some apps have already been optimized to work fine, while others, including most games, can be forced into full-screen mode. But for some, you're going to get letterboxing with bars on the top and bottom.. Interestingly, Huawei claims that while the 7X isn't up to any military standards for ruggedness, it is still durable thanks to "airbags" in each of its corners, so it can withstand drops better than most phones. It feels sturdy enough, but we didn't subject it to any torture tests and we wouldn't expect it to stand up the damage like the officially ruggedized Galaxy S8 Active .. The Honor 7X supports LTE bands 2/4/5/7/12/17, which gives it good connectivity on GSM carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile, though there's no support for Sprint or Verizon. It can take two SIM cards at the same time, one on 4G and one on 2G. I tested the 7X on AT&T and T-Mobile in midtown Manhattan and saw good network performance on both.. It also supports Wi-Fi on the 2.4GHz band and Bluetooth 4.1. If you want dual-band Wi-Fi or the ability to stream audio to multiple devices, the Moto X4 is an option, but it'll cost you nearly double.. Voices are gravelly and a bit on the robotic side, though transmissions remain audible. The earpiece is loud and easy to hear, and there's an extra loud mode for when you're outdoors. Noise cancellation is good, aside from some minor crackling from wind .. As you might guess from the price, specs are of the midrange variety. The US model (and the one we have for review) sports a Kirin 659 processor clocked at 2.4GHz with 3GB RAM and 32GB of storage. Huawei is selling a 7X with beefier storage and memory outside the US. Despite testing the base model, performance is solid across the board. In the AnTuTu benchmark, a measure of overall system performance, the phone scores 62,820, which is a little less than the Snapdragon 625-powered G5 Plus (63,845). The Honor 7X far surpasses entry-level phones like the Moto E4 (36,394), but can't stand up against the much more powerful OnePlus 5T (169,703).. Opening and switching apps is smooth and responsive, and demanding games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Modern Combat 5 both run smoothly, though the former crashed once I neared the RAM usage limit. The heavy UI means you might see some animation stutter compared with the cleaner stock Android build on the G5 Plus.. Left to right: Honor 6X, Honor 7X. Despite a sizable 3,340mAh battery, the phone clocked 5 hours, 11 minutes when we streamed full-screen video over LTE at maximum brightness. That's two hours less than the OnePlus 5T (7 hours, 10 minutes) and G5 Plus (7 hours, 35 minutes). That said, in more standard typical usage scenarios the phone can last a full day, and comes with a profusion of built-in power saving options that let you limit background activity, disable animations, lower screen resolution, optimize apps, and turn off connectivity, potentially adding hours of screen time. One downside of sticking with the older micro USB standard means the 7X doesn't support fast charging, taking nearly three hours to top up.. See How We Test Cell Phones. The 16-megapixel and 2-megapixel rear cameras on the 7X deliver pretty standard midrange performance. That means they take good, fairly crisp shots outdoors and in bright settings, but tend to get noisy in lower light. Outside, color reproduction is good, focus is fast, and there's minimal noise and grain. Indoors or in dim settings, things can be a little more dicey, with noisy or out-of-focus shots being somewhat common.. Pro mode lets you adjust things like white balance and ISO to improve clarity. There's also bokeh, a nifty feature that lets you focus on a foreground object and blur out the background. The blur effect is a little stronger than the 6X , but won't match the smooth, uniform look you get on flagship phones. There's also a portrait mode when you're taking photos of an individual. Again, it's a cool effect for adding depth to a shot, but don't expect the same degree of crispness or the many background lighting options you'll find on the iPhone X.. Video is available at 1080p; 4K capture isn't supported. There's no OIS so recordings can be a bit jittery, but they're clear in good lighting. An 8-megapixel front camera takes solid selfies , but hasn't changed much from the 6X. It's clear enough outdoors but a bit soft indoors, often adding a warm tint that makes photos look overprocessed.. The 7X comes running Android 7.1 Nougat with Huawei's EMUI 5.1. Huawei says the phone will get an update to Android 8.0 Oreo in the future. EMUI is a heavy software layer that alters app icons and the settings menu, and adds new features. By default, apps are splashed across the home screens, but you can enable the app drawer if you prefer it. There are also a slew of features like the aforementioned power-saving modes for the battery, performance-boosting modes, display tweaks, and gesture controls.. Bloatware is fairly minimal, consisting mostly of Huawei apps. Out of 32GB of storage, the 7X has 19.74GB free. It can take a microSD card up to 256GB instead of a second SIM card if you need more storage. Adoptable storage isn't supported, so the memory card will appear as a separate volume.. At $200, the Honor 7X is priced similarly to the Moto G5 Plus. It has a sleek build that incorporates a tall, 18:9 aspect ratio to maximize screen real estate, along with solid overall performance, and decent camera capabilities. The G5 Plus, meanwhile, gets you a traditional aspect ratio, stock Android, and longer battery life. It's a slightly better choice than the Honor 7X for most users, but if you prefer the 18:9 design, by all means get the Honor—the differences in performance are negligible. If you're looking for an even more affordable option, the Moto E4 offers just enough power to meet basic phone needs.. Bottom Line: The Huawei Honor 7X is an excellent unlocked phone that boasts flagship-level features at an affordable $200 price.. Ajay Kumar is PCMag's Analyst obsessed with all things mobile.

Editor Rating: Excellent (4.0) Dec 20, 2017. No dual-band Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth 5.0, or USB-C. The Huawei Honor 7X is a promising unlocked phone that boasts flagship-level features at an affordable $200 price.. There's never been a better time to be shopping for a new phone on a budget. The Huawei Honor 7X, for instance, brings flagship-level features to buyers who wouldn't dream of spending $700-plus on a new device. For $199, the 7X gets you an 18:9 edge-to-edge display that maximizes screen real estate and minimizes bezel. You also get a sleek aluminum unibody build, solid specs, and a capable pair of rear cameras. The Motorola Moto G5 Plus remains our Editors' Choice in this price range thanks to longer battery life and a lighter software layer, bu the Honor 7X is a worthy alternative if you prefer its form factor.. The Honor 7X departs from the Honor 6X in a few ways. While the phones share a metal unibody design, the 5.9-inch 7X is tall and narrow, measuring 6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and 5.8 ounces. That's nearly identical to the 6-inch OnePlus 5T (6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 5.7 ounces), and you get much more screen space than the similarly sized 5.2-inch G5 Plus (5.9 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces).. View All 8 Photos in Gallery. I found it easy to reach across the phone, though stretching your fingers from top to bottom is more of a challenge. You do get quite a few customizable one-handed modes that let you shrink the screen, move the keyboard to the right or left, or place a floating navigation dock anywhere you want, so no matter your hand size you shouldn't have much trouble.. The fingerprint sensor is on the back, toward the middle, and within easy reach of your index finger. The camera sensors are in the top right corner, so there's little chance you'll smudge the lenses when unlocking the phone. A micro USB charging port is on the bottom, which is a bit of a bummer if you're hoping to make the switch to USB-C.. The front of the phone is home to a 5.9-inch, 2,160-by-1,080-pixel screen. The 407ppi screen isn't as dense as the G5 Plus (424 pixels per inch), but I wasn't able to see any pixelation. Color accuracy is solid, and Huawei's Settings menu is loaded with customization options to change screen temperature and color saturation. By default, the 7X has rich, saturated colors that look like they're pressed up against the screen, similar to the Apple iPhone X. Viewing angles are great, but screen brightness could be higher. And the 7X is dimmer than the 6X, so it's a bit harder to see outdoors under direct sunlight.. As with other 18:9 phones, there are some display scaling issues. Some apps have already been optimized to work fine, while others, including most games, can be forced into full-screen mode. But for some, you're going to get letterboxing with bars on the top and bottom.. Interestingly, Huawei claims that while the 7X isn't up to any military standards for ruggedness, it is still durable thanks to "airbags" in each of its corners, so it can withstand drops better than most phones. It feels sturdy enough, but we didn't subject it to any torture tests and we wouldn't expect it to stand up the damage like the officially ruggedized Galaxy S8 Active .. The Honor 7X supports LTE bands 2/4/5/7/12/17, which gives it good connectivity on GSM carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile, though there's no support for Sprint or Verizon. It can take two SIM cards at the same time, one on 4G and one on 2G. I tested the 7X on AT&T and T-Mobile in midtown Manhattan and saw good network performance on both.. It also supports Wi-Fi on the 2.4GHz band and Bluetooth 4.1. If you want dual-band Wi-Fi or the ability to stream audio to multiple devices, the Moto X4 is an option, but it'll cost you nearly double.. Voices are gravelly and a bit on the robotic side, though transmissions remain audible. The earpiece is loud and easy to hear, and there's an extra loud mode for when you're outdoors. Noise cancellation is good, aside from some minor crackling from wind .. As you might guess from the price, specs are of the midrange variety. The US model (and the one we have for review) sports a Kirin 659 processor clocked at 2.4GHz with 3GB RAM and 32GB of storage. Huawei is selling a 7X with beefier storage and memory outside the US. Despite testing the base model, performance is solid across the board. In the AnTuTu benchmark, a measure of overall system performance, the phone scores 62,820, which is a little less than the Snapdragon 625-powered G5 Plus (63,845). The Honor 7X far surpasses entry-level phones like the Moto E4 (36,394), but can't stand up against the much more powerful OnePlus 5T (169,703).. Opening and switching apps is smooth and responsive, and demanding games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Modern Combat 5 both run smoothly, though the former crashed once I neared the RAM usage limit. The heavy UI means you might see some animation stutter compared with the cleaner stock Android build on the G5 Plus.. Left to right: Honor 6X, Honor 7X. Despite a sizable 3,340mAh battery, the phone clocked 5 hours, 11 minutes when we streamed full-screen video over LTE at maximum brightness. That's two hours less than the OnePlus 5T (7 hours, 10 minutes) and G5 Plus (7 hours, 35 minutes). That said, in more standard typical usage scenarios the phone can last a full day, and comes with a profusion of built-in power saving options that let you limit background activity, disable animations, lower screen resolution, optimize apps, and turn off connectivity, potentially adding hours of screen time. One downside of sticking with the older micro USB standard means the 7X doesn't support fast charging, taking nearly three hours to top up.. See How We Test Cell Phones. The 16-megapixel and 2-megapixel rear cameras on the 7X deliver pretty standard midrange performance. That means they take good, fairly crisp shots outdoors and in bright settings, but tend to get noisy in lower light. Outside, color reproduction is good, focus is fast, and there's minimal noise and grain. Indoors or in dim settings, things can be a little more dicey, with noisy or out-of-focus shots being somewhat common.. Pro mode lets you adjust things like white balance and ISO to improve clarity. There's also bokeh, a nifty feature that lets you focus on a foreground object and blur out the background. The blur effect is a little stronger than the 6X , but won't match the smooth, uniform look you get on flagship phones. There's also a portrait mode when you're taking photos of an individual. Again, it's a cool effect for adding depth to a shot, but don't expect the same degree of crispness or the many background lighting options you'll find on the iPhone X.. Video is available at 1080p; 4K capture isn't supported. There's no OIS so recordings can be a bit jittery, but they're clear in good lighting. An 8-megapixel front camera takes solid selfies , but hasn't changed much from the 6X. It's clear enough outdoors but a bit soft indoors, often adding a warm tint that makes photos look overprocessed.. The 7X comes running Android 7.1 Nougat with Huawei's EMUI 5.1. Huawei says the phone will get an update to Android 8.0 Oreo in the future. EMUI is a heavy software layer that alters app icons and the settings menu, and adds new features. By default, apps are splashed across the home screens, but you can enable the app drawer if you prefer it. There are also a slew of features like the aforementioned power-saving modes for the battery, performance-boosting modes, display tweaks, and gesture controls.. Bloatware is fairly minimal, consisting mostly of Huawei apps. Out of 32GB of storage, the 7X has 19.74GB free. It can take a microSD card up to 256GB instead of a second SIM card if you need more storage. Adoptable storage isn't supported, so the memory card will appear as a separate volume.. At $200, the Honor 7X is priced similarly to the Moto G5 Plus. It has a sleek build that incorporates a tall, 18:9 aspect ratio to maximize screen real estate, along with solid overall performance, and decent camera capabilities. The G5 Plus, meanwhile, gets you a traditional aspect ratio, stock Android, and longer battery life. It's a slightly better choice than the Honor 7X for most users, but if you prefer the 18:9 design, by all means get the Honor—the differences in performance are negligible. If you're looking for an even more affordable option, the Moto E4 offers just enough power to meet basic phone needs..

Gorilla glass is more than hard enough to prevent any scratching, so why would you put a screen protector on? I am surprised people still do this (if indeed they do, I never see them). The glass ones also do not prevent screen breakage. Anyways I have this phone, after one day for the most part I love it. It feels very delicate though, so a strong case might be a must in the long run (for now I'm just using the gel type case that comes with). I dont think you're gonna do better for 199 if you like big screens like I do. i got mine today so far not bad. they give you two cases 1 with a mobile game logo on, and one clear one. also no headphones (first time in the past 15 years i brought a phone it didn't give me a headphone) or screen protector.

My axon 7 was the last phone I used with no screen protector, and guess what after two months it had small scratches on the screen. Also the glass screen protectors absolutely prevent the actual screen from cracking. My wife dropped her iPhone from 6 feet on it's face and guess what? The screen protector shattered on the corner but after removing it the actual phone glass was perfect underneath.. You should not use a screen protector on any modern phone.

No support for T-mobile's new 600mhz LTE band (band 71) considering that there are few phones already out there which supports it, I am thinking it is not good for T-mobile customers if one would like to keep phones over a year. Of course, Price is good for what you get though. My Galaxy S7Edge is still going strong so I will probably wait until more band 71 phones come out..

January 7, 2018 8:00 PM PST. Red Honor 7X fans the flames. Honor View 10 boosts the power. Luckily, you can kick your fear of missing out of Huawei's affordable, classy-looking Honor phones -- because they're both coming to the US.. At the annual CES show in Las Vegas, the company announced that the Honor 7X will sell for $199 (roughly converting to £150 and AU$255), to be followed later in 2018 by the Honor View 10 , which will cost under $500 (roughly £370 and AU$640). Sorry, we're not exactly sure when the Honor View 10 will come to the US, but it starts selling in the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and India on January 8.. An offshoot brand of Huawei, Honor phones are often value buys with solid specs that dip below the top of the line, compared to Huawei's top models like the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro. Honor phones sometimes contain overlapping specs with Huawei-branded devices, but for a lower price. Huawei, the world's third-largest smartphone maker behind Apple and Samsung, continues to expand its portfolio of midrange and high-end devices.. Huawei Honor 7X sizzles in red. We've reviewed it in deep blue, a color we often see on Honor phones, and it also comes in black and gold. It looks great, and helps give the handset some visual pizzazz. $200 is a phenomenal deal, too. You'll be hard-pressed to find many competitors with a 5.9-inch display and dual rear cameras (other than the Motorola G5 Plus ).. Red-hot Honor 7X makes its CES 2018 debut. I'm going to go on a limb here and say that the Honor 7X is even better in red. You can only find 200,000 of the limited-edition red shade in the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia and India. And yep, you guessed it, it's a plug for Valentine's Day sales.. The 7X's unibody metal phone makes a statement, especially compared to every other black or silver device on the market. You could say the color is there to distract from the more modest hardware features, but the Honor 7X more than holds its own as a budget model.. It's got that big screen, slim bezels and a fingerprint reader on the back that also doubles as a shortcut key you can program to launch other apps and tasks. Plus, there's a microSD card slot (up to 256GB external storage), 64GB of internal storage and an 8-megapixel front-facing camera to go along with those 16-megapixel rear lenses. About the only thing that would make this even better for the price is some sort of water- or splash-resistance.. When it comes out, you can find it on HiHonor.com , as well as on retailers that pick it up.. All the new phones at CES 2018. Next up, the Honor View 10 is a 6-incher with a fingerprint sensor on the front, rather than the back. With 8 cores of processing might, it also packs in 6GB of RAM, which will help keep it running fast and smooth. That's the same internal setup as the much pricier. Mate 10 Pro , which is rumored to also come to the US , one that rated very well in our processor tests.. The View 10 also gets a bump above the Honor 7X in the camera department, with 20- and 16-megapixel rear cameras to go along with that 13-megapixel selfie shooter on the front.. Unfortunately, it isn't splash-proof either, but that's a nice-to-have, not need-to-have when you're looking at affordable phones.. Big screen, blue shell: It's the Huawei Honor View 10. Huawei's Honor View 10 phone searches for the sweet spot. See: All the new products from CES 2018. Read: CES 2018 is where you'll care about 5G. Honor View 10, Honor 7X US-bound for under $500 and $200. The Lovebox is a better gift than flowers for Valentine's Day. Watching 'Altered Carbon' on Netflix? This was its creepy marketing campaign.

Digit Mobile Phones Huawei Huawei Honor 7X Huawei Honor 7X Review. Published Date | Last Updated. Our Verdict Huawei Honor 7X: Detailed Review. Huawei Honor 7X Price in India. 12999/- Buy Now Set Price Drop Alert. The Honor 7X is a well-built smartphone with good battery life but loses out to the competition when it comes to the camera.. For Rs 13,000 device, the Honor 7X isn’t the best. It has a great display and good battery life and the overall performance is average at best. It loses out to the Mi A1 as far as the camera is concerned and graphically heavy games like Asphalt 8 stutter on the device. You can consider it if you aren’t a heavy smartphone user and like reading content or watching movies on the go, as the display on the smartphone is indeed good. But if the camera is something you are finicky about and aren't a fan of skinned OSes, then you may want to consider your options.. PROS Great display Good Battery Life Camera clicks good images in well lit conditions. CONS Graphically heavy games stutter on the device Underwhelming audio quality Competitors have better cameras.

Huawei Honor 7X is currently available at the best price of: ₹12,999. UPDATE: The Price for the Honor 7X was announced on 5th December. The device is available in two variants in India – 4GB RAM and 32GB storage priced at Rs 12,999 and 4GB RAM with 64GB storage priced at Rs 15,999.. Honor has launched an interesting portfolio of smartphones here in 2017, including the Honor 8 Pro , Honor 9i and the Honor 6X to name some. Today we have the successor to the Honor 6X, predictably called the Honor 7X. As of writing this review, the price of the smartphone hasn’t been revealed so we are presuming that it is priced under Rs 15000. This means that it will compete with the likes of the Moto G5 Plus , Lenovo K8 Plus , Redmi Note 4 , and the current heavyweight champion of the sub 15k category, the Xiaomi Mi A1. Does it have what it takes to become the king of the hill?. OS & UI: Android 7.1 with EMUI 5.1. NOTE: the review unit we received has 128GB built-in storage. Speaking of the build, the Honor 7X is as premium as the Mi A1 and that isn't a bad thing. The smartphone has a metal build with curved edges. It is ever so slightly taller than the Mi A1 and thanks to the 18:9 form factor, it has thin bezels on the sides. the phone has an attractive design. These bezels are thin enough that they add to the aesthetics of the smartphone and yet thick enough so that your palm doesn’t accidentally touch the screen if you are trying to reach one of the top corners during single-handed use. The top and bottom bezels are thick enough to comfortably hold the phone in landscape mode for watching movies and playing games.. At the back, you have the fingerprint sensor conveniently located. You also have the dual-camera setup which is protruding. I wish the dual camera setup was as seamless as it was on the Honor 8 Pro.. The right side of the smartphone has the power button and the volume rocker. The buttons are clicky and feel good. At the bottom, we have the micro-USB port for charging, which is a bummer in a USB-C dominated market. jack and the speaker grill on either side of the USB port.. Speaking of the design, the smartphone has the standard candy bar 18:9 design we’d expect in this price. and the curved edges make it comfortable to hold with one hand. Although reaching all corners of the phone isn’t easy with single-handed use, it is fairly ergonomic.. Overall, the build and design of the Honor 7X is good. The 18:9 display is a good addition when compared to other phones in the same price range.. As we’ve mentioned above, the smartphone has an 18:9 display for watching content. We faced no issue with the display on every day use. Apps that haven’t been optimized for the new aspect ratio show a black bar at the bottom with the option to stretch it to full screen. There are however some apps and games, like Asphalt 8, that run in full screen and take advantage of the new display. There are some 18:9 specific videos on YouTube as well and if you are watching the new Avengers: Infinity War trailer on the device, you can simply pinch to fit and enjoy the trailer in. Other apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, Gmail, Chrome, etc. work well on the new aspect ratio. If there is a complaint it’s with the audio quality from the speaker. Watching YouTube content including movie trailers, cinematic video game trailers, talk shows, Ted Talks, etc.. The background score of the movie trailer and the vocals seem muddled. The same can be said for music videos.. When playing games like Asphalt 8, the audio from the speaker is underwhelming too and sounds muddled.. When taking calls on the speakerphone, the voice is clear but the maximum volume is lower than what I’d expect from a smartphone.. Coming back to the display, it has a maximum luminance of 417 lux. It isn’t the brightest display out there and sunlight visibility does suffer, but if you are going to read web pages or Kindle books, you should be fine with auto brightness. You may want to bump up the brightness manually while watching movies though.. For those of you finicky about the colour temperature of the device, you can manually change it between default, warm and cold. You also have the ability to manually adjust it to your preference. There's even an eye comfort mode that essentially filters out. Overall, the display is very good and supports a pretty wide colour gamut. You will enjoy watching movies on it, but audio is an issue.. The Honor 7X has the company’s own EMUI overlaying Android. The UI has some interesting features. If you like, you can have an iOS-like layout where all the apps are present on the home screen. Or if you are one that prefers an app drawer, then that option is there too. The phone comes with a bunch of preloaded apps and games. There is one pre-loaded app I found quite interesting. In the tools folder, there is a Mirror app. It essentially uses the front-facing camera of the smartphone and you can zoom in as well if you want. It has a bunch of mirror frames to choose from and in case you want to check out your hair before that big date, I suggest you give this app a shot instead of opening the front-facing camera.. There is another interesting feature on the phone called WiFi bridge. Through this, the current WiFI network can be shared with other devices. This is very useful in a scenario where you have access to WiFi on only one device, but need the access for other devices too. Do remember, this feature on the Honor 7X is a battery guzzler.. Overall, the UI is fairly fluid and if you have used an Honor phone in the past, you will feel right at home. There are times when the UI stuttered during heavy multitasking and a few times when Facebook didn’t respond, but apart from that, the average user shouldn’t face any issues.. Let’s talk about the call performance. The audio is crisp and clear at both ends. The earpiece is loud and there is audio leaking when it is at full volume. So, if you are in a car and the earpiece is at full volume, the person sitting next to you can easily eavesdrop on the conversation. At about 60% volume, the earpiece works perfectly well. There are also some places in my house. where the network is an issue but the Honor 7X managed to grab better cellular reception than other phones in this case.. Running everyday apps like Facebook, Whatsapp, YouTube, Netflix, and more is a breeze. The smartphone multitasks well and stutters only when you run heavy apps and games back to back.. The biggest downside to the performance of the smartphone was gaming. Casual games like Farm Hero Saga ran well but graphically heavy games like Asphalt 8 showed. When there are a bunch of cars on screen, the framerate really drops. If you are one that wants to play graphically heavy games on the device, you may want to look at other options.. When it comes to benchmarks, the performance is at par with the Honor 9i and this isn’t surprising since both. phones are powered by the same SoC. Here is a look at the benchmark scores of the Honor 7X against some competing devices.. Overall, the performance of the device is not groundbreaking, but it has just enough to keep the average user happy. There aren’t any troubling heating issues with the smartphone either.. Moving to the camera, the Honor 7X has a dual camera setup with one 16MP camera and another 2MP camera. have colours that are true to the source. priced around 15k, there are smartphones with. Low light photos also present the problem of noise especially when the light is really low. Since the smartphone has a dual camera setup, you’d expect it to click good bokeh photos. The bokeh photos are average at best and the camera on the Honor 7X isn’t as groundbreaking as they were on the Honor 6X, with respect to their respective competitors. If a camera is of utmost importance to you, you are better off considering the Mi A1.. Below are some of the camera samples (resized for web). Using the phone for about a week, the smartphone can last you a little more than a 9 to 5 day with above average use. With brightness on auto, and 100% battery at 10am the phone was at about 20% battery when I got home at 8PM, which is good considering usage. We made many calls and sent many texts during the day, clicked some images, watched YouTube videos, Facebooking and some light gaming. The smartphone lasted for about eight and a half hours on the PC Mark Battery Test, which isn’t the best in this category but it isn’t bad either.. When you consider a 15K smartphone, you will look at devices like the Moto G5 Plus and the Mi A1 to name a few. The Honor 7x has a better display than the Mi A1, which means that you can enjoy movies on it a lot more. The 18:9 display also helps in this regard. However, the output from the speaker of the Mi A1 is far superior. When it comes to everyday performance, the phone is snappy. and can give the Mi A1 a run for its money. Gaming performance on the Honor 7X could have been better.. For Rs 13,000 device, the Honor 7X isn’t the best option out there. It has a great display and good battery life and the overall performance is average at best. It loses out to the Mi A1 as far as the camera is concerned and graphically heavy games like Asphalt 8 stutter on the device. You can consider it if you aren’t a heavy smartphone user and like reading content or watching movies on the go, as the display on the smartphone is indeed good.

Huawei Honor 7X first impressions: Well built, feature-rich phone that borrows a lot from the Honor 9i. Nov 21, 2017 07:19 AM IST. Huawei’s Honor sub-brand recently announced its Honor 9i, which was a great mid-range smartphone with the right hardware at the right price tag. Now, Honor is looking to launch a new smartphone, one that brings along the same level of quality as the Honor 9i and similar hardware as well, but hopefully at a lower price tag.. I got an early hands-on with the yet to be launched Honor 7X and here are my initial impressions.. Just like the Honor 9i before it, Huawei seems to be after Xiaomi’s budget smartphone offerings ( Mi A1 ) by delivering better quality hardware and dual cameras at what I suspect would be a slightly higher price. While the Honor 9i was priced at a surprisingly low Rs 17,999, one can expect the Honor 7X to be priced even lower, because it cuts a few corners when it comes to the cameras.. The Honor 7X feels just like the Honor 9i, we received a Graphite Black variant of the device and it feels premium with a smooth matte finish around the back. It features a unibody design with discrete antenna lines that grace the back of this well-rounded smartphone; one that feels cool to hold thanks to its all-metal construction.. The Honor 7X looks almost identical to its sibling, the Honor 9i. Unlike the Honor 9i, Huawei’s Honor logo sits on the bottom chin. The bezels on the sides are quite thin and are identical to those on the Honor 9i, with the large 5.9-inch display hogging up the front of the device.. The Honor logo now sits on the chin. Again, there are some minor differences here. The plastic lipping around the 2.5D glass screen has a matte finish. While it still looks quite premium, the Honor 9i appeared more seamless, because it featured a polished plastic lipping that merged well with the 2.5D glass. Slide your finger outwards from the display to the edges and you will feel the plastic edge, which is very unlike the Honor 9i. It is one of those minor details that casual users may not notice but would help a manufacturer bring down the price. Out here I am simply pointing out the differences, but in day-to-day usage, casual users would barely notice them.. gets a matte finish, but still looks good. Moving to the back, the vertically-aligned camera module on the Honor 9i is now replaced with a horizontal dual camera unit, which protrudes from the back of the device. The metal rings protecting the camera lens are well finished, and reminded me of the ring on my old and now ageing Apple iPhone 6s.. It took us plenty of effort to get the back to look squeaky clean Image: tech2/Rehan Hooda. The fingerprint reader sits high at the top center. but still feels easier to reach. Again, just like that Honor 9i, the matte coating or finish of the Honor 7X gathers fingerprints rather easily. With winter closing in and my sweaty palms, the end result is a smudgy mess. Adding to the mess, is the fact that these smudges are really tough to wipe off and need a thorough clean from time to time; like we did before shooting these photos you see in this hands-on.. This is one area that does not seem to have changed from the Honor 9i. The Honor 7X features a FHD+ (2,160 x 1,080 Pixels) LCD unit, which looks pretty good and showcased saturated colours.. The 18:9 display is the highlight of the device, considering that Vivo, OnePlus and Oppo have started to offer taller displays on their mid-range and flagship offerings in India.. The 18:9 display looks sharp and was bright enough indoors. The tall display offers an 83 percent screen to body ratio, which is similar to what we saw on the Honor 9i.. The display looked fine during my brief hands-on time and seemed to be just about bright enough. Colours don’t shift much when viewing the display off axis, but the brightness levels drop drastically.. The Honor 7X just like the Honor 9i features similar hardware that is almost identical when going by its specifications on paper.. There’s a HiSilicon-made Kirin 659 octa-core chipset that is clocked at 2.36 GHz and features eight Cortex A53 cores. Four of them are clocked at a lower 1.7 GHz for handling less-demanding tasks.. The Honor 7X gets a horizontal camera layout. Paired with what appears to be quite a capable chipset is 4 GB RAM and 64 GB of internal storage.. The Honor 7X runs Huawei EMUI 5.1 software with Android 7.0 Nougat as the base. While the software does seem like a bit of a let-down because it lacks Google’s latest and greatest mobile operating system, its customisations in terms of features and usability, tend to make up for it. Apart from the UI, which seems pretty flexible and customisable, it also seemed to run pretty fluidly during my short hands-on.. The Huawei Honor 7X features a 16 MP + 2 MP camera setup on the rear just like its elder sibling the Honor 9i, but cuts down on the front facing cameras by offering a single 8 MP camera unit.. Despite the lack of a dual front-facing camera, Honor said that it will offer a software portrait mode, which should work well.. That double barrell camera looks serious. What has grown is the size of that LED flash unit which should deliver better shots when used in low light scenarios.. The UI of the camera felt simple, functional and typically Honor. Upgraders will find all the controls exactly where they expect them to be. We will take a close look at the camera in our full review.. The Honor 7X features a 3,340 mAh battery, which seems pretty good for powering a display that is 5.9-inches tall. Add in the Full HD+ resolution and those Cortex A53 cores and one can expect some good battery life. What is lacking is the presence of a Type-C reversible USB port, and fast charging.. As for the rest of the connectivity options, you get 4G+, 4G, 3G and 2G bands. There Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n (2.5/5G Wi-Fi), GPS/AGPS, GLONASS, Wi-Fi Direct, microUSB v2.0, dual SIM slots and USB OTG support.. During my initial hands-on with the Huawei Honor 7X I had just one question in my mind – why? Why should Huawei launch a Honor-branded smartphone, that looks similar and even performs similarly to its mid-range Honor 9i? This is more so because the 9i is an all-rounder and performs on par with smartphones that are even priced higher.. The Honor 7X will compete with Xiaomi Mi A1 at the higher end of the budget smartphone segment. As I was typing down the first impressions, it now became clear. That the reason for the Honor 7X’s existence is Xiaomi. While the Honor 6X was a great predecessor, the 7X packs in so much more with an 18:9 ratio display, all-metal body and a dual camera setup with a capable portrait mode, that should easily help take down Xiaomi’s Mi A1 and more. We will be looking at the Honor 7X more deeply in our full review.. Whether it will beat the competition also depends on its pricing, one that will be revealed at its December launch..

Well it's almost 2018 and smartphones are no longer new technology. $200 isn't exactly cheap when there are dozens of budget phones WELL under $100 out there that are built and perform well, even very well. My $40 Moto E4 seems to do almost everything my sister-in-laws $800 Pixal 2 does and do it just as well and just as fast. The screen side by side from normal viewing distances looks as good, browsing the web seems just as fast, overall apps seem to open as fast or maybe in some cases just a split second or two slower. Of course her came blows mine away, but for the most part the two phones work and perform the same.. at a price of $200, what are you really expecting tho? It is very cheap and excluding headphones is a way to reduce down the cost.. This comment has been rated as unhelpful by Slickdeals users. Sending it back, but I must say I do love the phone. No bezels is the future, there's a very big difference to any phone with bezels. I dont even want to go back to my bezel laden S6 plus. It's a shame because this phone is great. even now I can barely bring myself to send it back. I wish someone could tell me if a software fix is possible for the BT/wifi conflict. One other annoying real life issue, on my Samsung I can drill down into BT connections and set it for media, call audio, etc. I cant seem to do that on this 7x. It's an issue because I have a BT car radio, but I dont have a mic/take calls on it, only play music/podcasts over it constantly. But now if I get a call in the car on this 7x, the radio tries to "take over", i cant answer the call normally until I physically turn off the radio to get it to "let go" of the incoming call so it goes to my phone handset instead. My s6 initially had this issue too, but i just went into BT settings, found the connection for my car radio, and set it to media only. This phone appears to only have a per-call toggle, not a global permanent one. Unless I'm missing it somewhere but I dont think so. But yeah fix the BT/wifi conflict and for the most part Huawei has a big winner here IMO. The screen is a bit weak in some areas IMO but you aren't touching this brushed metal premium feel and bezel less display elsewhere for 199, with a solid mid range chipset and it is fast and smooth.. This comment has been rated as unhelpful by Slickdeals users. I've read a few reviews that mention the non-Gorilla Glass screen being an absolute fingerprint and smudge magnet and hard to clean. How about for $179? All brushed metal, 18.9 aspect ratio, Gorrila Glass 4 and a huge 5100 mAh battery. Some say it works in the U.S. Forbes gave it a good review.

You should not use a screen protector on any modern phone. Gorilla glass is more than hard enough to prevent any scratching, so why would you put a screen protector on? I am surprised people still do this (if indeed they do, I never see them). The glass ones also do not prevent screen breakage. Anyways I have this phone, after one day for the most part I love it. It feels very delicate though, so a strong case might be a must in the long run (for now I'm just using the gel type case that comes with). I dont think you're gonna do better for 199 if you like big screens like I do. This comment has been rated as unhelpful by Slickdeals users. It has some kind of hardening. Anybody who owns it will tell you. Their tech support said it has some type of hardened glass. Gorilla glass is just one trademark. It's mirror polished on the screen but with no screen protector and pocket carry for two weeks I've not seen one scratch. It does catch prints but so do all phones. It's very easy to wipe down which means it has some oleophobic coating. I've watched videos next to Moto G5S Plus etc and they are catching just as many smudges when you see an unflattering angle. I was very concerned about that issue before I got the phone, it's not an issue. The screen is mirror polished, does not scratch, and very clean. They did their homework on that aspect. I took this shot for their RMA so I can upload it easily enough https://i.imgur.com/AHddtbK.jpg. Mirror polish, no hint of scratches, no screen protector, two weeks riding pocket. Now to get to the RMA, it's a little troublesome. Their tech support has some trouble with english, kept misspelling my name etc. They ask you to take pictures of all sides of the phone and send plus pic of invoice. I've done that but the emails started bouncing back, "file too large" error or something. The first email went, but I forgot to send the pic of the front so I sent another, after that every one started bouncing (but they make you cc to two addresses, only one is bouncing them I guess). We'll see what they contact me tomorrow, but the process doesn't seem particularly easy.. This comment has been rated as unhelpful by Slickdeals users. Not sure what you mean by "Gorilla glass is just one trademark." The phone definitely does not have Gorilla Glass. I've confirmed this through not only chat twice, but an email to cooperate as well. Also the screen scratches from coins and keys as seen in the video below (as well as many others on youtube). Like the Honor 5X and 6X before it, it too has a sub-par scratch-prone display.

This comment has been rated as unhelpful by Slickdeals users. I already saw that a long time ago before I even owned the phone. I think he scratched the soft part of his coin onto the glass (jerry rig will teach you many "scratches" are actually streaks of material from the scratching device rubbing on to the phone since gorilla glass is harder than all everyday materials). That said, I thought about rubbing keys on it myself or something but nah,. What you see is a typical indian style fake video. They will hold their personal phone (so you know they aren't going to do anything to damage it) and lightly tap it with a hammer etc and "test" it, trying to get a few thousand views I guess. Except hand give way and they barely touch the phones. Why dont you buy the phone or stop talking about it? It has hard glass. If you owned it you'd know. I was obsessed worrying about this prior to buying it, so, trust me. Now I'm worried only about other problems!. BTW somebody else here confirmed through chat it has aluminum silicate glass aka hard glass. What I mean is Corning doesn't have a monopoly on tempered glass. Gorilla glass is just a trademark. I would trust Gorilla glass the most since it's obviously the most popular and funded, but this has something that's good so far. It keeps fingerprints off better than my S6. But that's 1.5 yrs old so I think the coating has worn down.. Not sure what you mean by "Gorilla glass is just one trademark." The phone definitely does not have Gorilla Glass.

The phone does not have Gorilla Glass, the display on it is not as hard as Gorilla Glass, it scratches easier as shown in several videos, but alas, I suppose they are all a "jokes" too, lol..

Thank u, got my 7x today, side by side compare, screen is much much better than 6x. This screen colors definitely have some pop to it. Not on AMOLED level, but its FAR from washed out. My Moto E4 screen would be considered washed out when its side by side with it. I think the first thing you will say when you see the screen in person is, "No way this device cost $199.".
