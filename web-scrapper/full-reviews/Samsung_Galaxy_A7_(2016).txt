By Prashant Kapoor | 5 May 2016. I bought Samsung’s A7 2016 mobile in April'16 for Rs 32,500. From day 1 it was hanging, shutting down & heating. As it was under 7 days replacement guarantee, i returned it & got a new handset.. The new handset also had problems of hanging & shutting down (though it was not getting heated). The fellow there told that it seemed to be software problem & reloaded the software. However, since the problem persisted, i again took-it to service centre. As it was over the 7 days replacement warranty, they refused to replace the handset. Instead, they kept the phone for checking & doing the needful. They replaced the motherboard & gave back the phone. However, the phone was still hanging & shutting down. I again took-it to service centre. They again kept the phone with them for about 4-5 days for checking & returned saying that the phone does not seem to have any hardware issue & that the problem could be because i was transferring apps from the old phone (also a samsung phone, galaxy grand, 3 years old but still works great). So I was instructed not to transfer any app from the old mobile but to download them afresh. Accordingly, i have not transferred apps from the old mobile. However, phone is still hanging & shutting down. I have taken pics of the moment when the phone hanged & when it shutdown & watsapped it to the person at service centre.. Its almost a month since I bought this model & ever since have been running to the service centre. Fellows at service centre don’t seem to have any idea of the problem & are just doing trial & error. Suffering for believing in the Samsung brand & buying their phone with specs, which are easily available in other brands for much less cost. Rather than having just 7 days replacement guarantee, if Samsung is confident of the quality of its products, it should offer at least 1 month replacement guarantee. Else it should offer to replace the phone if the problem cannot be pinpointed & if the customer I dissatisfied.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 11 out of 12 people found this review helpful.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery and Conclusion. posted by Victor H.. Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. 4 Call Quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction The Samsung Galaxy A7 (2016 edition, aka A7 6) launches early in 2016 to set the tone for mid-range phones: those that are not as expensive as the finest Galaxy S series and iPhones, but also a level above the Moto Gs of this world.. The Galaxy A7 (2016) is a 5.5-inch smartphone – it's large, but probably not as big as it's screen diagonal would suggest. The first thing to know about the Galaxy A7 (2016) is that it looks and feels stunningly good, stylish. While carrying the phone for a week or so while reviewing it, people noticed it and asked about it, often complimenting it. You know there are supposed to be some compromises with mid-range phones, but the one area where Samsung did not compromise was looks. The rest is TouchWiz running on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop on a Snapdragon 615 system chip with 3GB of RAM, a fingerprint scanner with support for Samsung Pay, a 13-megapixel camera with OIS and a fairly large, 3,300mAh battery. At the moment of this writing, the phone is on sale in only a few European markets. It is expected to become more widespread in February, while plans for US availability of the phone are unclear. One version with AT&T 4G LTE bands has passed FCC certification, though, so there is a chance that it might come to the States in the future. Now, let’s see how it all plays out in real life. In the box: Samsung Galaxy A7 (2016) 2A - 5V wall charger microUSB Cable User manual SIM ejector tool Design Super stylish, eye-catchy design, very solid feel in the hand. The Galaxy A7 (2016) looks a lot like Samsung’s current flagship, the Galaxy S6. The frame is made out of metal, the physical buttons are also made of metal, while the front and back are Gorilla Glass 4 with a slight curve towards the edges. The A7 (2016) feels monolithic in the hand, reassuringly solid. We’ve already touched on this in the intro, but let’s make it abundantly clear: this phone looks every bit as stylish and well made as the top phones out there and it’s impossible to tell just by the looks that we’re dealing with a mid-range phone. In the hand, it has some nice heft to it, but it’s not too heavy and does not tip over when you hold it. Despite rocking a glass on the back and front, it does not catch a lot of fingerprint marks and looks fairly clean, so you don’t have to frantically wipe it every few hours. In terms of color, it comes in a choice of gold, white, black and pink gold, and we have the gold version up for review. It’s also fairly compact for a 5.5” phone: its width is just 2.92” (74.1mm), while the popular iPhone 6s Plus that also has a 5.5” display has a width of 3.07” (77.9mm). The A7 (2016) is also not as tall at 5.96” vs 6.23” on the 6s Plus. Both phones are equally thin at 7.3mm, so big props to Samsung for making a 5.5” phone fit in such compact dimensions. The buttons are in the typical for Samsung layout: a large, physical home key (with a fingerprint scanner in it) below the display, a back button on the right and a multitasking key on the left (both are capacitive keys with a backlight that appears for a short while when you touch them). The lock key is on the right, while the two separate volume buttons are on the left, and all are made of metal and feel very clicky and quality-made. On the bottom, there is a microUSB port for charging, a 3.5mm headset jack and a speaker grill as well as a microphone. Up top, there is only a secondary mic. It’s worth noting that the phone does not have an LED notification light, so there is no way to know if you have a missed call or notification without actually turning the screen on. We can’t say we miss the notification light all that much: with the notification avalanche on modern phones, a notification light is also a big distraction, always urging you to pick up your phone. Sometimes it can be useful, though, so for many the lack of it would be a downside. This is a dual SIM phone: it features a hybrid SIM card tray on the right - you can either use this phone with two SIM cards, or use just one SIM card and use the second slot for a microSD card to expand storage.. Display One good looking display with pleasing colors. The Galaxy A7 (2016) features a 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels. This makes for a sharp-looking display: at this resolution, it is nearly impossible to notice pixelization or any jagged edges to images on the screen. What about the colors, though? Samsung’s AMOLED displays come with the nice function that allows users to choose how the screen looks. The default ‘Adaptive’ display mode features unrealistically oversaturated colors and bluish whites, which come together for a very punchy, but wildly unrealistic, cartoony look to everything. We switch all our Samsung AMOLED displays to the ‘Basic’ mode (you do this by going into Settings - Display - Screen Mode), as this is the mode that conforms to the sRGB color standard, the de facto standard for all images and video. Sticking with Basic Mode and the sRGB standard means that you see images the way those who captured those images intended you to see them. Every other screen mode and standard results in images that get some sort of artificial boost that ruins the way those who took pictures and made movies intended for them to be seen. Great news is that in Basic Mode, the screen on the Galaxy A7 (2016) looks very good. Whites are just a tad on the green side, but for all else, this is a well balanced display. Outdoors, this is not the brightest of screens (peak brightness reaches just 369 nits), but it blocks out reflections fairly well, so we found it not all that uncomfortable to use. At night, it can go all the way down to the minimum level of 1 nit, which makes it easy on the eyes, something that is great for those who can’t fall asleep without their phone. The light sensor also works very well, set the phone to automatic brightness and it will adjust the levels very adequately. Viewing angles are also solid, but there is a pronounced color shift towards blue when you view the display at an angle.. 5.96 x 2.92 x 0.29 inches. 151.5 x 74.1 x 7.3 mm. 5.7 x 2.8 x 0.29 inches. 144.8 x 71 x 7.3 mm. 6.06 x 3 x 0.44 inches. 153.9 x 76.2 x 11.06 mm.

Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. Motorola Moto X Pure Edition (2015). The numbers below represent the amount of deviation in the respective property, observed when a display is viewed from a 45-degree angle as opposed to direct viewing.. Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. Motorola Moto X Pure Edition (2015). The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Motorola Moto X Pure Edition (2015). The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Motorola Moto X Pure Edition (2015). The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Motorola Moto X Pure Edition (2015).

Stutter, pause, poor animations, or whatever you want to call it, continues to be a huge problem for Samsung. Hardcore Samsung fans (or just owners that need to justify their purchases) try to deny it and say Samsung phones are near lag free. (Posts: 44; Member since: 07 Jan 2016). posted on 04 Feb 2016, 11:06. No one phone is lag free that counts even for iphones. (Posts: 1; Member since: 18 Jun 2016). posted on 18 Jun 2016, 07:42. in response to #16 Hide. But Samsung wins hands down on the lag war. Samsung has yet to master the ability to integrate software solutions that do not place a negative impact on hardware performance and I've got 4 generations of their phones to prove that. Samsung should leave software development to the professionals who know how to integrate softwarew and hardware effectively. A benchmark program does not give any clear indicator that your phone will or will not be struggling with real world use and Samsung phones never compare unless you've managed to unlock their bootloaders and re-tune them correctly. They hacked Android and ruined it and then had the nerve to prevent people from hacking their hack. Sometimes leaving Android to function as it was intended is more reasonable than using fancy front end software that literally adds more weight to the phone. Switching from wifi bluetooth and towers is drastically hindered on Samsung when their touchwiz is active. Removing all of the Samsung control from my Note 3 so I could run more of Android instead of Samsung actually made it possible to use my Note 3 for Internet calling. But it's not even just this. A major lag using my S3, S6, Note 3, Note 4 have all proven several issues with their lagging when compared to other phones and also running Samsung hardware without ANY Samsung software. The straw that broke the camels back was when I was able to use an LG Leon to breeze through app downloading, installations and when running video chat programs, I saw my Note 3 was smoother but I had occasional video freezing and when it recovered from this, the Samsung Note 3 missed a very large segment of the video. At least the LG Leon kept a smooth consistent data flow. Samsung software removed from the equation put me back on the map and that enables me to get smooth FPS with streams. I resent Samsung, yet I continue to use their phones. Probably because I have so much money invested in them since the past 5 years have been plagued with carrier upgrade offers and contracts that locked me in. Not to mention Verizon being another eminent threat to those who prefer freedom and choice as they work closely with Samsung to ensure we cannot remove any of their so called crapware and locking the bootloaders and takes away from our ability to correct their screw-ups. Bottom line is, Samsung needs to go. To those who eventually end up with the understanding about things regarding locked boot-loaders, the native UI plastered on each phone by manufacturers I say, it's good to be in control of your devices. There will soon come a day these devices will be doing more than serving the purposes we bought them for. And it isn't going to feel good when you know your entire life is being controlled and not managed by technology. So, you should be fighting for the right to control your devices instead of letting them control you. (Posts: 5029; Member since: 30 Mar 2015). posted on 04 Feb 2016, 15:31.

If you like your phone big, then the new A7 with its 5.5-inch display probably won't disappoint.. by January 13, 2016 10:58 AM PST. What else you'll need to know 5.5-inch screen with 1,920x1,080-pixel resolution 1.6GHz octa-core processor 3GB of RAM 16GB of internal storage 128GB microSD card slot for external storage 3,300mAh battery 13-megapixel camera 5-megapixel front-facing camera Android 5.1.1 5.96 by 2.92 by 0.29 inches (151.5 by 74.1 by 7.3mm) 6.07 ounces (172 grams). Editors' note: This hands-on first take shares some text with those of the new Samsung Galaxy A3 and A5 .. Samsung's Galaxy A range of smartphones is designed for a younger, trendier crowd who can't afford its higher end flagships, such as the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. Announced late last year, the updated 2016 versions of these phones sport metal bodies similar to the S6 Edge, with shared design cues such as rounded edges and shiny glass rears.. While the specs can't quite compare with the Edge, the new Galaxy A phones will pretty much knock your socks off in the looks department, and really only vary depending on the screen sizes of the phone. The Galaxy A7 is the biggest of the lot at 5.5 inches, and packs the best specs. While I say best, bear in mind it's still more of a midrange device, though it will give top-end phones a run for their money with its octa-core processor and 13-megapixel camera.. The phone first made its debut in China alongside the Galaxy A3 and A5 , and is set for global markets in the new few months. Alongside the other two phones, the A7 will also be sold in Southeast Asia. In Singapore, the A7 won't be cheap when sold without a contract, as it will retail for S$698, which converts to approximately $485, £335 and AU$690. Do check with your local retailer for exact pricing and availability.. The A7 will likely do well when sold subsidized with a two-year contract, which should help defray the phone's more expensive standalone cost. Given that it also looks similar to the iPhone 6S Plus and shares the same display size, it could offer a viable alternative to those who want the iPhone looks but Android software.. Meet Samsung's updated Galaxy A smartphones (pictures). Besides a 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display running at full-HD resolution, the phone also sports a 13-megapixel rear camera, like the A3 and A5. What sets it apart from the other two phones, however, is a bigger built-in 3,3000mAh battery and 3GB of RAM.. Like the A5, the A7 also comes with a fingerprint sensor located on the home button and has dual-SIM 4G LTE connectivity. Unlike the A3, which uses one of the dual-SIM slots for the microSD card slot, the A5 and A7 come with a separate microSD card slot that supports up to 128GB of extra storage.. The phone feels premium and luxurious, easily comparable to the company's higher-end phones. The specs of the A7 are certainly respectable, though I daresay phones from China will be the A7's main competitor, given their overall cheaper pricing. Check out the key specs below..

Samsung's Galaxy A7 2016 is a great phone, but no match for the Galaxy S6. The Galaxy A7 tops Samsung’s mid-range A series for 2016, a Galaxy S6 lookalike with dual-SIM functionality and outstanding battery life. Should you buy the Galaxy A7? We find out in our Galaxy A7 review. We review the brand-new Galaxy A7 for 2016, a dual-SIM mid-range Android phone with a gorgeous design. 5.5in full-HD (1920x1080) SuperAMOLED display with Gorilla Glass 4. 1.6GHz Exynos 7850 64-bit octa-core processor.

The A-series is Samsung ’s mid-range smartphone line-up. Refreshed for 2016 it includes the Galaxy A3 , Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 , which are differentiated by their screen size, core hardware and battery capacity. Also read our Galaxy A3 2016 review and Galaxy A5 2016 review .. Also see: Best Black Friday Phone Deals. We’ve always been slightly troubled by Samsung’s Galaxy A-series. Not because they aren’t great phones, but because they aren’t as good as the previous-generation S-series flagships and yet as brand-new phones they cost more.. Take the Galaxy A7 (2016) reviewed here. It’s difficult to get hold of in the UK, although our review model was supplied by Mobile Fun which charges £399. That’s £40 more expensive than the £359 Samsung Galaxy S6 ( Amazon UK ) which, aside from battery life, offers significantly more for your money. Read our Galaxy S6 review .. It’s also more expensive than the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016), which is easier to get hold of (and therefore cheaper), and has largely similar specifications and performance. Mobile Fun stocks the A5 at its £289 RRP, but you can find it cheaper elsewhere. For example, the Galaxy A5 currently costs £194.94 at Amazon UK .. Our first impressions are that you’d be crazy to buy the Galaxy A7 over either the Galaxy A5 or Galaxy S6, but it is possible you might find a better deal with the A7 on contract. Let’s take a closer look at the Galaxy A7 to see exactly what it has to offer.. Also see: Best phones 2016 .. Samsung couldn’t have done a better job in updating its A series for 2016, at least in terms of design since not a lot else has changed. Gone is that cheap-looking plastic and in its place is a premium design with a metal frame and glass front and rear to match its S series. More specifically, it’s a match for its 2015 flagship, the Galaxy S6, which helps to differentiate it from the curvier 2016 Galaxy S7.. Also see: Best Android phone 2016 .. It’s not unwieldy, but the Galaxy A7 is the largest model in the A series, and slightly bigger than the Galaxy S6 with a 5.5in screen. As was the case with its predecessor, there’s a full-HD resolution of 1920x1080 pixels that is crystal clear but also lower than the Galaxy S6’s Quad-HD. It’s the same resolution as is seen on the 5.2in Galaxy A5, but stretched over a larger area the pixel density is reduced (but not enough for you to notice the difference).. Also see: Best Samsung phones 2016: What is the difference between Galaxy Note, Galaxy S, Galaxy A and Galaxy J?. In common with the Galaxy S6 this is a SuperAMOLED panel, which is our favourite kind of screen tech. It produces vivid, saturated colours and deep contrast, while delivering ample brightness and infallible viewing angles. Super AMOLED is also a good friend to long runtime, and the Galaxy A7 gave a better performance in our Geekbench 3 battery life test than any phone we’ve tested.. At 5.5in the screen is an ideal size for viewing media and playing games, yet the phone itself isn’t a great deal larger than the screen. There are very slim bezels to the left and right edges, but a bit more space up top and down below due to the physical home button (now with fingerprint scanner built in), speaker, front camera and sensors. Also see: Best phablets 2016 .. Like the S6 a SIM slot sits below the power button on the phone’s right side. It’s joined by a microSD slot - one big advantage over its S-series rival - while a second SIM slot sits at the top of the device in the same place as the Galaxy S7’s. We’re not entirely sure why the two SIM slots had to be separated, but it works.. The new Galaxy A7 for 2016 is a bit chunkier than its predecessor, at 7.3mm against 6.3mm, but it also packs in a higher-capacity (but non-removable) battery, now up to 3,300mAh from 2,600mAh. As we noted earlier battery life is outstanding, so this really isn’t something we can grumble about - especially given that 7.3mm is still incredibly thin.. The primary camera juts out every so slightly at the rear, but not enough to cause the phone to wobble uncontrollably when used on a desk or other flat surface. We’re pleased to find that the single speaker is located at the bottom rather than the back, and also that despite all that glass the Galaxy A7 still feels reasonably tough thanks to its Gorilla Glass 4 protective armour.. See all phone reviews .. The Galaxy A7 is capable, but we’re not convinced performance is good enough for Samsung to justify a circa-£400 price tag. If you want the fastest phone you really need to turn to Samsung’s Galaxy S series.. With its 1.6GHz Exynos 7850 octa-core chip, 3GB of RAM (up from 2GB and an extra gig over the Galaxy A5) and Mali-T720 MP2 GPU the Galaxy A7 is up to casual gaming, video streaming and everyday smartphone tasks.. You would expect the A7 to be the fastest phone in the A series - and it is, but surprisingly only just. As with the screen’s clarity, you really will not be able to tell the difference.. In Geekbench 3 and AnTuTu general processing performance benchmarks the A7 performed only slightly better than the A5, but significantly lower than the S6. It was the same story with the JetStream JavaScript benchmark, GFXBench graphics tests and even Geekbench 3 battery life.. Let’s not do down that last point, though: with 11 hour 49 mins the Samsung Galaxy A7 2016 sits at the top of the smartphone pile for runtime. We have not tested a phone that has managed to last longer in this benchmark.. Pleasingly the Galaxy A7 also supports Samsung’s Adaptive Fast Charging technology, but unlike the Galaxy S6 there’s no wireless charging.. In the chart below you can see how the Galaxy A7 performed in comparison to the Galaxy A3, Galaxy A5, Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S7. For comparison with other brands of smartphone check out our article What’s the fastest smartphone 2016?. Storage is still stuck at 16GB internal, which isn’t anything to shout about at around £400. However, we appreciate the ability to add a 128GB microSD card to bolster the internal storage capacity, plus the fact Samsung - unlike so many other phone makers - doesn’t force you to decide between microSD and a second SIM..

Samsung's Galaxy A7 (2016) edition, aka Galaxy A7 6, is a 5.5" phone with stylish looks and a quality build. It's not a flagship: it sits below the Galaxy S and Galaxy Notes in Samsung's hierarchy, but it has the looks of one. Under the hood, it sports a Snapdragon 615 SoC (Exynos 7580 in other markets), 3GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, a 13-megapixel camera with OIS and a 3,300mAh battery. In real-life its performance is its weakest point, while battery life is excellent. -------- PhoneArena.com is your ultimate source of mobile tech news, reviews, and info.

Samsung Galaxy A7 (2016) and Galaxy A5 (2016) First Impressions. Ketan Pratap , 04 February 2016. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Samsung, at its Southwest Asia Forum 2016 in Kuala Lumpur, announced details of its new Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 2016 edition smartphones for the Indian market. The handsets were first unveiled last year in China, though the company had not disclosed anything about the availability of the two refreshed models outside China at that time.. The Galaxy A series was first launched in late 2014 , and now the South Korean giant claims that it has contributed to increase in its worldwide 4G market share, along with the J-series. According to Samsung , its share in 4G devices increased from 25.9 percent in December 2014 to 60.6 percent in December 2015. The company however declined to share exact numbers.. We spent some time with both the new Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 2016 edition smartphones at the launch event and here are our first impressions.. At the press briefing in Kuala Lumpur, Samsung stressed that the new generation Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 are designed using glass and metal. This was evident when we first held the devices in our hands. Both the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) and the Galaxy A7 (2016) take design cues from last year's flagship, the Galaxy S6. Both phones have metal frames that give them a durable feel, while the rear has an all-glass look. You can see the body colour through the glass.. Similar to the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 series, the rear panels of the Galaxy A5 (2016) and Galaxy A7 (2016) are very shiny, making it hard for us to photograph them without reflections. Despite the use of glass on the rear, we were confident of using both the devices without them slipping from our hands. The phones are comfortable to hold with one hand despite both having screens larger than 5 inches. The front panels on both are mainly dominated by their screens, with the Samsung logo embossed above. The speakers are housed on the bottom and they did sound louder than average, though not really exceptional.. The physical home button, which is a design touch found on the entire range of Samsung Galaxy devices, sits below the display on both phones, with the fingerprint reader embedded into its surface. Fingerprint recognition can be considered one of the biggest additions to the 2016 Galaxy A-series. Oddly, the units showcased at the launch event had their fingerprint scanners disabled for some reason. Samsung executives promised that the feature will be available in commercial units of both the Galaxy A5 (2016) and the Galaxy A7 (2016). On either side of the physical home button are the capacitive Recents and Back buttons which light up only when touched.. Here are the full specifications of the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) and Galaxy A7 (2016) smartphones.. For the second-generation Galaxy A series, Samsung has used its in-house Exynos processors. The first-generation Galaxy A3, Galaxy A5, and Galaxy A7 used Qualcomm-based chipsets.. ( Also see: Samsung Galaxy A7 (2016) vs. The Galaxy A5 (2016) is powered by an octa-core Exynos processor clocked at 1.6GHz clubbed with 2GB of RAM and has 16GB of inbuilt storage. The Galaxy A7 (2016) also packs an octa-core Exynos SoC clocked at 1.6GHz and 16GB of storage, but is equipped with 3GB of RAM. For displays, the Galaxy A5 (2016) features a smaller 5.2-inch full-HD (1080x1920-pixel) Super Amoled display while the Galaxy A7 (2016) sports a 5.5-inch full-HD Super Amoled display. Both phones have 13-megapixel rear cameras with LED flashes and optical image stabilisation (OIS), and 5-megapixel front-facing cameras. The rear cameras on both the handsets feature f/1.9 aperture lenses. Much like the first-generation Galaxy A-series, the new Galaxy A5 (2016) and Galaxy A7 (2016) support 4G LTE. Samsung said that the units support LTE Cat. 6 connectivity which allows up to 300Mbps downloads. Other connectivity options include Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, ANT+, 3G, GPRS/ EDGE, USB 2.0 and NFC connectivity options. Both phones come with dual-SIM support and Samsung has specified that the microSD card slot is separate from the second Nano-SIM slot, so you aren't forced to choose one or the other.. ( Also see: Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) vs. The Galaxy A5 (2016) is backed by a 2900mAh battery while the Galaxy A7 (2016) comes with a 3300mAh battery. Compared to the previous generation, both phones have improved battery capacities. To recall, the Galaxy A5 2015 edition included a 2300mAh battery and the Galaxy A7 came with a 2600mAh battery. Samsung has also added fast charging support to both phones. Ultra Power Saving Mode, which Samsung claims is loved by users in India, has also been added in the Galaxy A5 (2016) and Galaxy A7 (2016) phones.. The software on the Galaxy A5 (2016) and Galaxy A7 (2016) phones looked much the same as on the first-generation Galaxy A series with very minor tweaks and additions. Both phones run the company's custom UI on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop. Google and Microsoft apps, as also seen on other high-end Galaxy phones, are displayed prominently. We did not come across any major software changes in our limited time with the devices. Samsung said it has no current plans to release a Marshmallow update, when asked about possible timeframes for the new Galaxy A5 (2016) and Galaxy A7 (2016).. In the limited time spent with the handsets, we observed that they handled multitasking and Internet browsing pretty easily without any lags. We will reserve our verdict on Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) and Galaxy A7 (2016) performance until we get a chance to put them through paces for a detailed review.. In our brief tests of the cameras, we found that images taken with the Galaxy A7 (2016) in normal indoor lighting were vibrant with accurate colours. The images taken with the Galaxy A5 (2016) under the same conditions had minor noise at the edges. Low-light shots on both phones also looked good. The cameras protrude slightly from the bodies, like the ones on other high-end Galaxy smartphones.. The front cameras on both devices also managed to capture some decent selfies. We will have to wait till we can run these phones through our full review process to decide whether the cameras on the second-generation Galaxy A5 and A7 are better than those offered by the competition.. Final Thoughts The Galaxy A5 (2016) and Galaxy A7 (2016) smartphones have been launched in India with price tags of Rs. Both phones will go on sale starting February 15 and will be available in physical retail as well online through Snapdeal. To woo customers, Samsung also announced a bundled Airtel data plan which will give users up to 30GB of data free over six months.. At this price point, the biggest competitor to the Galaxy A5 (2016) is the OnePlus 2 , which is currently retailing at Rs. Motorola's Moto X Style , priced at Rs. 29,999, is also available at around the same price.. The Galaxy A7 (2016), on the other hand, will have to take on Samsung's 2015 flagship, the Galaxy S6, which is now retailing for Rs. 33,900 via the company's official India e-store..

Samsung's new mid-range A7 has been spotted on a benchmarking site sporting twin 16-megapixel cameras on the front and the back.. Samsung's debacle with the Note7 may have set back its plans in the high-end flagship level, but they're not ceding any ground in the mid-range. Samsung is looking to follow up its popular Galaxy A7 (2016) with a new iteration of the model, and it's already showed up on several sites. The Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) has been spotted on both GFXBench and on Zauba, confirming that it's coming, and giving us a quick look at the specifications.. Zauba tracks the imports coming into India, ostensibly en route to Samsung's testing facilities in India. The listing on Zauba notes that three units of a Samsung mobile phone model SM-A720S have been shipped from South Korea to India. The value per unit was declared as INR 13,716, which translates to PHP 9,804. Of course, the final price won't be that low, but it'll be just a smidgen above that mark. Zauba also confirms that the phone will have a 5.7-inch screen.. Of course, the GFXBench listing shows a much more clear snapshot of its specifications alongside its synthetic performance. The unit on GFXBench, SM-A720x, has been listed with most of the important specifications. The phone comes with a 5.5-inch 1080p Full HD screen, an octa-core Cortex A53 processor clocked at 1.8Ghz, a Mali-T830 GPU, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and a 15-megapixel main and front camera. It ships with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow.. It's interesting to note that the phone will have the same caliber camera for both front and rear shooters, indicating a possible focus on selfie-shooting. More striking is the discrepancy in the screen size. Zauba lists it as 5.7-inches, while GFXBench has a smaller 5.5-inch screen. Given that the 2016 version of the A7 had a 5.5-inch screen, it's more likely that Zauba made a mistake in the listing, but it's hard to say as GFXBench has also made mistakes in listings before.. With the listings coming out on Zauba and GFXBench, the actual launch of the phone can't be too far off. We'll find out the real deal once Samsung releases the device officially.. Samsung Galaxy A7 is a great model but available at a hefty price. 5.2 inch HD display with Active Matrix OLED will allow its users to enjoy the beauty of clarity and high definition. 3 GB of RAM will offer a superfast operation in every process. Android 5.1.1 Lollipop has fascinate this model from inside and,. 64 bit Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor will improve its performance in a great extent. Samsung Galaxy A7 in the Philippines. Samsung Galaxy A7 2016 is yet another delightful smartphone in Galaxy series that effectively showcases the beauty of modern technology. This model has been launched in December 2015, and it has been gaining quite a success in different markets.. This Samsung Galaxy A7 2016 has been launched with the Galaxy A5 2016, and both of these smartphones are almost similar except some specifications that distinguish them. The same materials like the glass and metal which can be found in the Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 is being used in this new Galaxy A7.. The best feature of this new Galaxy A7 model would be its weight which is very less, this model only weighs 169 grams. A sleeker body has been given to this new Galaxy A7 with a dimension of 7.3 mm.. Samsung is a multinational conglomerate company that is headquartered from Samsung Town, Seoul. Samsung was founded by Lee ByungChul in the year 1938. Initially Samsung was a trading company that dealt with food processing, insurance, textile and retails.. The company entered the world of electronics industry in 1960s. Although Samsung manufactures various products and has several branches, Samsung Electronics has now become one of the world's largest customers serving branch.. This new Galaxy A7 model brings latest and trending features that will allure its users. This means users will be able to experience a totally different smartphone with its astonishingly great specification.. The edges of this device have been smoothly rounded. The screen being larger has a glass texture that is not slippery, and a good grip can be maintained while holding this device so that it does not fall.. There are little or no cons of this new Samsung Galaxy A7 as everything has been perfectly proportioned. The one limitation of this device is that there might not be the availability of Android Marshmallow.. The other dissatisfactory factor of this new Samsung Galaxy A72016 would be that its price is not in the range of what many would call a favourable price. So because of its high price, most of the customers may not be able to buy this new Galaxy variant.. Despite the price and other factors, it is said that this model has already started to sell out in the Philippines market. As the Philippines is holding an increasing number of market revenue, more number of electronic gadgets like this will be continued to launch in the upcoming years to serve the people.. As the Philippines is growing and developing day by day, this country has become one of the most important target markets for many multinational corporations to appeal their new launches..

Funciones clave Samsung Galaxy A7 (2016). Opiniones y Comentarios Samsung Galaxy A7 (2016). Hay 59 opiniones del Samsung Galaxy A7 (2016) .. El móvil es buenisimo, no m puedo quejar, pero tengo mis dudas, sobre todo en cuanto al almacenamiento externo, actualmente tengo puesta una tarjeta sd de 32gb y trabaja ok, le puse una de 64 gb y note que se puso un poco mas lento, al abrir la carpeta de administrador de archivos se tarda, quisiera q m explicaran q paso y si puedo usar la tarjeta sd de 64gb sin problemas, gracias. Ya lo tengo dos años y le doy tunda, ni capa protectora tiene, esta todo quebrado por fuera, pero una vala por dentro.. Se me fue en la lavadora el celular y cuando me di cuenta el fono aun prendia....lo abri y lo seque y después de eso no prendio , lo deje con alcohol isopropilico. volvio a prender pero se recalentaba al parecer fueron los condensadores.. es por eso que busco la placa madre quisiera saber si la venden. Porque este celular a mi parecer ha sido el mejor.. al año y medio se esponjo la pila, y en atencion a clientes demasiado caro para obtenerla, en funcion es bueno pero algunos salen con desperfectos.. En mi opinión la que por cierto se basa en mi propia experiencia y no en comentarios es un excelente producto ya que a la distancia de 2 años de uso y valla que le doy uso no tengo queja alguna. GRACIAS SAMSUNG POR ESTE MAGNÍFICO TELÉFONO A7 2016. Una pregunta es resistente al agua. No se porque veo varios comentarios negativos hacia este teléfono, ya va para año y medio el mio y estoy muy contenta con el, ningún fallo, resistente al agua (he andado con el en noches de tormenta y se me ha empapado) y sigue funcionando normal. Basura La linea de moviles samsung Jamas se comparara con los iphone!!! Aunque pasen 3 generaciones samsung sera esa empresa que vende basura cobierto con elegancia?. Es normal q caliente mucho la pantalla cuando lo tienes prendido por mucho tiempo. No puedo creer que un telefono caro, no pueda soportar la humedad que hay en el ambiente, ni la humedad por llevarlo en el bolsillo del pantalón. Creo que fue diseñado para lugares secos, no duró ni 8 meses y otro telefono miles de pesos mas economico que tiene el mismo uso con diferente numero de celular siga funcionando normal.

The phone is slightly thicker now, perhaps to accommodate the bigger battery, and a tad heavier than before.. Samsung Galaxy A7 (2016) review Samsung Galaxy A7 (2016) benchmarks. Dimensions: 5.96 x 2.92 x 0.29 inches (151.5 x 74.1 x 7.3 mm). Weight: 5.96 oz (169 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Features: Fingerprint (touch), Touch sensitive control keys.

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Optical image stabilization, Autofocus, CMOS image sensor. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Voice activation, Self-timer, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Night mode, Effects. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Octa-core, 1600 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 17.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Great battery life Gorgeous screen Slick design Smart cameras. Rather big Performance lags behind rivals Old Android. Samsung Galaxy A7 (2016) Review: We test out Samsung’s mighty 5.5-inch Galaxy A7 2016, packing a 13-megapixel camera, vibrant Full HD display and loads of great features for just £350. But can the A7 compete with other mid-range Android marvels like the OnePlus 3 and Moto G4 Plus? Here’s our full Galaxy A7 2016 review.. Samsung’s Galaxy A-range handsets are excellent mid-range mobile phones, packing most of the best features that you get in flagship phones like the Galaxy S7 , but at a much more wallet-friendly price. The Galaxy A7 2016 is the biggest member of the Galaxy A family at 5.5-inches, although thanks to the likes of the OnePlus 3 and Moto G4 Plus that’s actually fast becoming a ‘standard’ phone size. So, how does the Galaxy A7 2016 stack up against those fellow massive mid-range mobiles and is it a recommended purchase? Here’s our full in-depth Galaxy A7 2016 review.. Read next: Galaxy A3 2016 vs Galaxy A5 2016 vs Galaxy A7 2016, what’s the difference?. As with the Galaxy A3 2016 and Galaxy A5 2016 before it, Samsung has once again slapped together a great-looking phone using its trusty design combo of glass and metal.. Curved metallic edges give way to a glossy rear plate that picks up scuffs rather easily, but can be buffed up just as quick if you’re fussy about such things. And thankfully that glass surface is reassuringly tough, fending off scrapes and scratches.. Of course, the Galaxy A7 2016 is a bit of a beast at 5.5-inches. The bezels are reasonably skinny but the A7 is a bit of a struggle to slip into your pocket, unless you have reasonably baggy pants. And unlike the Galaxy S7, it isn’t water-resistant.. We’d definitely recommend two-handed use to avoid losing your grip and dropping the handset, but thankfully you do at least get a nifty one-handed mode. Tap the home button three times in quick succession and the screen shrinks towards your thumb, making operation much easier. You can also choose to squash the keyboard towards one edge, for more comfortable typing.. Shoot us for stating the obvious, but the Galaxy A7 2016 will be a perfect portable partner for anyone who wants to enjoy movies and TV shows on their daily commute. That spacious 5.5-inch screen makes for a comfortable viewing experience, while the Full HD 1920×1080 resolution ensures that video and photos look crisp and clean.. As this is a trademark Samsung Super AMOLED screen, you can of course expect images to be supremely vibrant, with stand-out colours. Don’t worry if you prefer more subdued visuals however, as Samsung’s display settings allows you to dial down the vibrancy for more realistic images.. You can carry around a huge media collection thanks to the Galaxy A7 2016’s microSD memory card support, which allows you to boost 16GB of on-board storage.. As with the Galaxy A5 2016, the A7 packs a fingerprint sensor into the home button so you can quickly and securely unlock the phone. It’s not as fast as rival sensors such as the OnePlus 3’s scanner, but you won’t exactly be left hanging around. However, the sensor does occasionally throw up ‘no match’ errors, something we very rarely saw on the OnePlus 3 or Moto G4 Plus.. The Galaxy A7 2016 comes in a choice of two models; there’s the standard single-SIM version and another model with two SIM card slots, which is the version we reviewed. In this case, the primary SIM card tray housed on the right edge of the phone is joined by a second SIM tray up top, which holds another SIM card. In this way, you can choose between two different cards for sending messages, data usage and so on.. Android Lollipop is the OS of choice here; there’s no Marshmallow upgrade just yet, which is bad news considering Android Nougat is just around the corner. That means that you miss out on some cool features such as control over app permissions, and could also explain why the fingerprint sensor isn’t as strong as some rivals (as Android Marshmallow included built-in scanner support).. Like the rest of the Galaxy A-range, I had no problems with the Galaxy A7 2016’s performance. The Snapdragon 615 processor stuffed inside might be more basic than the OnePlus 3’s Snapdragon 820, but it gets the job done, running Android Lollipop without issue and opening apps the instant you tap their icons. You can also play the latest games with a silky smooth frame rate.. Even with heavy use, I still comfortably made it through a full 24 hours between charges and closer to two days with moderate use. Battery power barely drops at all when the phone’s hibernating, even if you’re getting plenty of messages and other notifications. In fact, so far the Galaxy A7 2016 offers better battery life than the likes of the Xperia X and the OnePlus 3.. Sadly the A7 doesn’t charge up as fast as the OnePlus 3, which boasts the excellent Dash Charge tech. However, it’s reasonably fast, charging to full after roughly 90 minutes at the plug.. Samsung is fast becoming the king of smartphone camera tech, and the Galaxy S7 is still our favourite mobile snapper of 2016 – check out our Galaxy S7 re-review if you don’t believe us.. The Galaxy A7 2016 actually packs a ‘better’ camera than the S7 on paper, with a 13-megapixel snapper positioned on the rear of the phone, compared with the S7’s 12-megapixel effort. Of course, megapixel count doesn’t determine camera quality, and while the A7 2016’s shooter is very good indeed, it’s not quite as versatile (especially in low light) as Samsung’s flagship phone.. That said, the Galaxy A7 does produce some stunning shots and is easily better than the OnePlus 3’s much maligned camera. Samsung’s auto mode handles tricky light effectively and rarely produces a dud shot, as long as conditions aren’t too dim. Essentially the camera tech is the same as that found in the Galaxy A5 2016, so check out our full A5 camera review feature to see what we thought and here’s some photo samples for you to peruse.. You can also shoot up to 1080p Full HD video footage using the Galaxy A7’s rear camera, which looks great when viewed back on a big screen. The lens only takes a second or so to switch focus when needed and handles changes in lighting quite well, although darker scenes tend to come out quite grainy. Audio is clearly picked up and there’s some basic built-in image stabilisation to cut down vertical judders when moving around.. Here’s a video sample shot with the Galaxy A7 2016.. Yet another excellent mid-range Samsung handset, the Galaxy A7 2016 is rather big but has definite appeal to media fans who demand a gorgeous screen for enjoying their movies and shows. The camera tech is dependable and solid for the price, although performance and battery charging times lag behind rivals such as the OnePlus 3. And if you’re not fussed about an enormous screen, we’d say go for the Galaxy A5 2016 instead.. Samsung Galaxy S8 Review: In Depth. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Review: No smoke, just fire.
