It contains radio but it's signals are not good so you cannot hear it unless you keep your hand containing the mobile in the air... The speed of the mobile is very very very slow. My recommendation is not to buy this. This will be a total waste of money. Though the site claims that th toshiba ts608 has no speakerphone i have to say that mine does. sound is very poor due to low speaker quality but it exists..

CNET también está disponible en español.. The Good Slim design; call quality; dedicated music buttons.. The Bad Menu design; 8MB of internal memory.. The Bottom Line Overall the TS608 is a good phone -- the SMS input system is straightforward, the dedicated music buttons are a useful addition and the keys on the keypad aren't annoying small. It loses some points due to the small amount of internal memory, though, and, among other things, slow search capabilities in the contacts list. Visit manufacturer site for details.. The TS608 is a stylish, slim phone that looks great on the outside but suffers from a lack of style on the inside. It's relatively easy to use but it has some annoying flaws --. the contacts list is very slow to respond, it needs more internal memory and the camera isn't great --. but overall this phone is a solid mid-level model that performs as expected without leaving you too disappointed.. Design The Toshiba TS608 is a slim candybar handset that comes in a brushed-steel-style casing. It measures 47mm by 110mm by 10mm and fits comfortably in a pocket without feeling so thin that you can't hold it properly.. On the front of the TS608 there's a colour screen that displays 262,000 colours and measures 31mm by 39mm. It's bright and easy to see during dialling and texting, but is a little small when viewing Web pages or pictures.. Underneath the screen there's a flat alphanumeric keypad with a four-way navigation rocker at the top. The keys on the keypad are large enough to press, but due to their flatness are sometimes difficult to distinguish clearly. The navigation rocker has a mirrored blue. either side are two soft keys and the send and end call keys.. The sides of the phone are minimal aside from the top-left side, which features a mini USB port for charging that doubles up as a USB to PC port. On the back there's a 1.3-megapixel camera and a speaker for playing music and ringtones. At the top are dedicated music keys that let you access the MP3 player with the touch of a button --. due to their position, you can operate the MP3 player easily while it's in your pocket.. Features Using the TS608 provokes a series of highs and lows. The interface is rather ugly and the icons look as if they were drawn by a child, but the SMS application is good and it's not overly difficult to understand what section does what. so it won't work in certain countries, and the contacts search system is among the slowest we have ever tried.. One of the TS608's best features is its easy-to-use MP3 player that can be operated very easily using the dedicated music buttons at the top of the phone. Unfortunately the MP3 player suffers from a lack of memory though, and there's no 3.5mm adaptor included for the headphones. With only 8MB of internal memory there's not much storage space, and while there is an expandable microSD slot, there's no microSD card in the box.. The MP3 player itself isn't particularly impressive and features a very basic track listing system and interface, but. it can support songs in AMR, MP3 and AAC+ and you can create playlists. There's also an FM radio which works using the proprietary headphones as an aerial.. The TS608 has a 1.3-megapixel camera, which is. acceptable for sending small MMS pictures to another phone, but. they don't look great on a large screen or when printed out. The camera also lets you shoot video, but the image quality is equally bad compared to higher res cameras like that on the Nokia N93 .. Once you take photos or videos you can send them to friends via Bluetooth, MMS or upload them to your computer via a USB cable. While the connectivity options aren't as vast as the HTC TyTN 's, they're not bad for a mid-level handset. Other features include a Web browser, an alarm, a calendar, memo, notes, a countdown clock, a unit converter, Java games and polyphonic ringtones.. Performance The audio quality on calls sounds clear and loud and the MP3 player is acceptable, however we would have preferred it if we could have used our own headphones.. The camera's image quality is definitely not as good as the camera on the Nokia N93 or the Sony Ericsson K800i. -- the pictures come out discoloured and pixellated --. but they are acceptable for MMS messages if not printing or viewing on a large screen.. Battery life is quoted at 150 hours of standby time and 150 hours of talk time.. Edited by Mary Lojkine Additional editing by. Hot Products. The first great smartphone of 2015.

[ Toshiba ] TS608 (TS30) review. [ Toshiba ] TS608 (TS30) review. I just got this phone second hand for 70 euros. The tested version is TS608 as sold in France by the provider SFR (Vodafone). Detailed specifications are available from the Toshiba website or from other Mobile Oriented Websites. This mobile is packed with nice features such as Bluetooth, 1.3Mpix camera, MicroSD slot, Mini USB (mass storage), FM radio with RDS, MP3 player... The box is stylish and includes charger, stereo headset, phone and battery, manual. As you can see below, the phone is candy-bar-style, very thin but quite tall. The fun feature is the MP3 contorl keys on the top. They can't be used for FM though. The Mini USB port is for charging, headset and USB-PC connection. Bonjour ! this is the customised starup screen. The menus have not been altered with the Vodafone style. For once we get the original themes. The backlight is very bright (4 levels of intensity) and the screen is very very good. You can hardly see pixels, and pictures look astonishingly colourful. There are three themes, oen looking ugly, the 2 others looking cool, like this one. Here, the phone with the headset. It is required to use the radio, even when put on the loudspeakers. The FM tuner is RDS capable (cool, Nokia should learn from SE and Toshiba then...). Only 10 presets can be defined. To skip frequencies, up and down arrows are used. Left and right are for volume (5 levels). To select a preset, push long on the number keys. You can't have an autosave for presets. It has to be done manually. The mp3 player is pretty basic. I don't own a MicroSD card, so I didn't test the mass storage transfer speeds. To transfer stuff from the phone memory to a PC, only bluetooth can be used. USB is for the memory card only. Camera mode : full screen view. This phone has the resolution 800*600, which is rare enough to be mentionned. Photos can be viewed in list style, grid style (both with thumbnails). The backlight of the keyboard is deep blue and very bright. - Keys are a bit hard to type on. Maybe it gets better with th time.. - The stereo heaset is not that good for music. - MP3 ringtones are less loud than midi tones. This phone is pretty cheap for the nice pack of features. It will of course not sell well due to the bad press Toshiba had when they launched the first imode phone TS21i. I like it because not everyone has this phone, and it is pretty good.. don't forget folks : it's dual band 900/1800MHz so, no good in most of South America and all of North America. It also doesn't work in Japan/Korea. Which is real shame, as I was considering it.. Just got TS705 which is 3G. no time yet to review, but will do it soon. It is a very good phone, I think I will keep it for a while. I have been in touch with Toshiba lately, to try to get more news on new realeases. They told me TS605 (a cheaper TS608) and a new 3G clamshell would be released soon in Europe (meaning unlockable phones). Let's hope this clamshell is a good hi end one.. New 3G clamshell? Maybe they'll port the 810T or 811T over to Europe... Just a little update now that I have owned this phone for long. I just found how to play mp3 in the background, this is a cool feature that I first thought was missing. I have moved to another home and the FM reception is perfect, it beats a sony Ericsson K600i, but not Nokia N70. The main drawback with this phone is the poor headset bass rendering, and the keys that are a bit "hard" to let you type messages fast. It is not easy to find a better headset as it has mini USB port (TS705 has jack headset). But for the price, I now recommend this phone. I was a bit sceptical at first but I really start to like it now. It beats TS705 in terms of screen, and music features. TS705 has 3G and a slightly better camera. I wonder if TS32 is really different from TS608 as the features appear to be the same.... I'm just curious, does it use the same data/charger port as the 3G Toshiba phones?. for TS608 and TS605, It is a mini usb port for data, headset and charging. TS705 has mini usb for data and charger too, but headset is mini jack. The European candybars differ really a lot from the clamshells. Maybe they are just rebranded phones not even manufactured by Toshiba.... That's what I'm thinking, it's either that, or it's a European division Toshiba set up to make phones 'tailored' to European tastes. Even the user interface is vastly different to the 3G phone selection.. Yes and what troubles me is that TS608 and TS705 have completely different interfaces. Really nothing similar in the OS. I guess they really are phones just rebranded... Darn, I just shouldn't have bought them ;). Those two are different too? I guess they are OEM made then. What about the TS10 though? That phone used a design Toshiba had used already in its V602T for Vodafone Japan (now Softbank).. I haven't touched a TS10 yet. Surprisingly, an old stock of TS10 has been found in France and all shops start to sell it for 89 euros. Many people bought it and are already getting rid of it after just one use. Price is now about 50 euros. I think this phone must be the hell of a crap, so I won't bother buying it this time. Toshiba you better gimme a good phone next or I'll stop buying your stuff :D :D And STOP making OEM phones in Europe. I think they are trying to break into the budget end of the market (but not doing particularly well - we ALL know how well Nokia 1100's sold... I think what makes their 3G phones better is the UI for a start, the features, the nice screens, and designs, and the 803T/705T external buttons etc.... Calling them 3G phones is not accurate, let me remind you TS705 is a 3G phone too :). And even then, Toshiba has different UIs for the same, Japanese-made models, depending on the country they're headed for, and the interface used in HK is absolutely awful compared to the one for Softbank (in the example of the 811T versus the TX80).. not quite sure what to go about describing them as :p. JDM phones, JP model phones, Japan model phones, etc. The ones that come out of Japan, basically. Anyone knows where to get a detailed review of TX80 with screens? I don't know if I should buy it and I can't find anything about the phone (at least in English). How do you say "phone review" in chinese or japanese? :hehehe:. EDIT : oops i spoke too fast, no BT and no email client, amost 400, is Toshiba kidding me? No way I bought this phone !. Well, toshiba keeps getting worse and worse, I might as well stop being a ToshiFan, I'm afraid... any suggestion for a new brand to worship (not Sharp) ?. Nope, I'm sticking with Sharp and secretly praying they will surprise the world at 3GSM next year.. The problem with Sharp is that I got traumatized by v902SH and its horrible pic quality and the 100s of confirmation screens for simple actions. I never dared to touch another shapr phone since.. Not all Sharp's are like that. You get used to any that have issues like that after a while anyway.. Now you are making me miss my 3 day old locked 903SH :(. The 902SH was an exception and yes, its picture quality was horrible. However, the 903SH fixed it and its a great phone to use. I personally prefer the confirmation prompts because there's nothing worse than hitting the hang-up button by accident and losing a message you were writing, the webpage you were browsing, or some other valuable situation.. I'm from Romania and I just buy a toshiba ts608 phone from spain becouse this type of phone don't have been lunched in my country. the problem is that I don't have stereo headset for phone and without headset i can't listen FM radio. Can tell me someone if on the phone work ather stereo headset from other phone plsssss!!!!!!!. nu ai *** sa folosesti alt tip de headset la el decat unul original!insa in pachetul cumparat,nu avea si castile?eu am cumparat tot din Spania,ca aici sunt momentan, si pachetul include si castile - care le folosesc si ca hand`s free! daca imi raspunzi, spune-mi cat tine bateria pls!ms!.

T oshiba TS608 which available exclusively to the Vodafone network, is also known as the Toshiba TS30 in Asian markets, is an ultra-slim and thin 9.9mm triband GSM phone handset. Toshiba TS30 / Toshiba TS608 features 1.3 megapixel camera, 1.9″ 176×220 pixel 262,000 colours QVGA LCD display, Bluetooth, FM radio, microSD expandable memory (up to 512Mb) slot, a web browser and email client. Toshiba TS608 or Toshiba TS30 supports and acts as background MP3 playback player, USB mass storage device and an MP4 video player, and weighs 81 grams.. CNet Crave reviews Toshiba TS608 and concludes that “there are some features that have us concerned where it’s only dual-band and the battery life seems a little short, with only 150 minutes talk time.”. Mobile Gazette concludes that Toshiba TS608 is an attractive and competent handset. However, Toshiba have struggled to make much impact in Europe as their handsets tend to be very similar to Sharp’s who also have an exclusive arrangement with Vodafone. The TS608 is a little different though, and it might meet with more success..
