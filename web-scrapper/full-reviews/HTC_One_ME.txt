Lacks a proximity sensor that turns the display оff during a phone call. The HTC One ME is the world's first handset to be powered by MediaTek's Helio X10 processor - a 64-bit, 2.2 GHz octa-core chipset. As previously reported, the One ME borrows design elements from both the One E9+ and One M9+, having a polycarbonate body that's strengthened with a metal frame. The new handset also offers a fingerprint sensor, BoomSound speakers with Dolby Surround sound, LTE, dual SIM support, and a 5.2-inch Quad HD (1440 x 2560 pixels) display. On the back, the One ME has a single 20 MP camera with 4K video recording and dual LED flash, while on the front we can see a 4 MP UltraPixel camera. Other features include 3 GB of RAM, 32 GB of internal memory, microSD card support, and a 2840 mAh battery.. Dimensions: 5.94 x 2.83 x 0.38 inches (150.99 x 71.99 x 9.75 mm). Weight: 5.47 oz (155 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 1440 x 2560 pixels. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Effects. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 23.30 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 24.9 days (598 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 13.50 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 26.1 days (626 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 28. Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Compass, Hall (for flip covers). 802.11 a, b, g, n, ac, dual-band. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

HTC One ME is actually the closest you can get to the original HTC One M9 which was never launched in India. Technology Tech Reviews HTC One ME Express Review: Another flagship, but more. Rating: 4 out of 5. Updated: November 9, 2015 9:49 am. HTC Desire 12 with 18:9 display, Android Oreo leaked ahead of. launch HTC Desire 12 with 18:9 display and MediaTek SoC leaked, expected to be entry-level. phone HTC U11+ with 6-inch 18:9 display, Snapdragon 835 SoC launched in India: Price,. HTC ’s strategy now seems to be to carpet bomb the mid and high-end smartphone segment with as many models as possible. Of course, this means even the company might find it a bit difficult to keep tag on what it is selling. But the Taiwanese company has for sometime believed it is a good strategy to have flagships for different price points. So in the upper end of the shelf the company has the HTC One M9+ and HTC One E9+. Now, the company has launched the HTC One ME somewhere between these two devices.. The HTC One ME is actually the closest you can get to the original HTC One M9 which was never launched in India. The HTC One M9+ was different in many ways, but the ME seems more like the M9 with a plastic body and a fingerprint reader. It is also a stylish device, especially the all-black unit that I had for review.. HTC U11+ with 6-inch 18:9 display, Snapdragon 835 SoC launched in India: Price,. specifications HTC U11 will get Android 8.0 Oreo update in India from. today HTC 10 starts receiving Android 8.0 Oreo update:. Report The best flagship mobiles for 2017: iPhone X, Galaxy S8 Plus, Pixel 2 and. more HTC One E9+ Express Review: Yes, this will be the biggest challenge for HTC One. M9+ HTC One M9+ Review with video: Great design, smooth. Specs: 5.2-inch (1440x2560p, ~565 ppi) display | Mediatek MT6795 Octa-core 2.2 GHz processor | 3GB RAM 32 GB internal storage expandable up to 128GB | 20MP rear camera with dual tone flash + 4MP front camera | 2840 mAh battery | HTC Sense UI 7.0 with Android Lollipop. Watch video: (App users click here ). People will want to buy this phone just for the style quotient and I am convinced that is one reason why customers, at least some of them, don’t really mind paying a premium for HTC phones. The One ME has a matte finish rear panel that is good to hold and an extra large lens on it that makes people take note.. The QHD screen makes everything look good, especially the photos shot on this phone. I am not a big fan of watching long videos on the phone, but this 5.2-inch display paired with the dual speaker and Dolby Surround sound make it ideal for those who like this small screen experience. Making phones sound really good is something HTC has really mastered over the years.. The 20MP camera is really good and really fast. It can capture really subtle shots and that is expected, given that HTC has been good with its cameras of late. But I was more impressed by the quality of the selfie shots. However, by default the phone beautifies these front camera shots a bit and you will need to switch that off to look more natural.. The overall performance is really good and there is no lag or stutter. The phone does heat up a bit but not as much as the other flagships these days. The battery life is good enough to last a working day. I managed 12 hours on 4G which is an achievement.. I like the HTC Sense UI as it is simple and intuitive. But the contacts app needs a bit of this intelligence to trickle in. I could not copy numbers from contact cards for instance. This is something I end up doing multiple times a day; not having a simple copy option was frustrating. Plus, I thought the app had to be much more intuitive when it came to search.. As I said before, the phone does heat up a bit though it does not breath fire like a Snapdragon processor. But when the heating starts, the phone loses battery life fast.. At Rs 40,500, this phone gives you everything you need from a flagship — style, processing power and great camera. So if you are looking for a top-end phone that ticks all the boxes then this is a good buy. If you don’t want to spend this much, then I still think the HTC One E9+ is the best value for money phone in this range from HTC..

The new handset also offers a fingerprint sensor, BoomSound speakers with Dolby Surround sound, LTE, dual SIM support, and a 5.2-inch Quad HD (1440 x 2560 pixels) display. On the back, the One ME has a single 20 MP camera with 4K video recording and dual LED flash, while on the front we can see a 4 MP UltraPixel camera. Other features include 3 GB of RAM, 32 GB of internal memory, microSD card support, and a 2840 mAh battery.. When autoplay is enabled, a suggested video will automatically play next..

CNET también está disponible en español.. HTC One ME officially heads to China. This HTC One variant features some of the company's best features, like a super high-definition screen and powerful dual speakers.. June 4, 2015 12:04 PM PDT. HTC China debuts another 5.2-inch One with powerful hardware. HTC welcomed yet another member of the One family on Thursday. Set to launch in China, the One ME is not all that different from the One M9+ unveiled only two months ago (and both can claim the One M9 as their lineage).. HTC unveils larger-screened One M9+ phone in China. HTC's smartphone design chief hangs it up. Get the most out of the new Dot View case for the HTC One M9. Internally, the One ME and One M9+ share many of the same specifications, including a 5.2-inch display with a 2,560x1,440-pixel resolution, and a 2.2GHz MediaTek Helio X10 processor.. But while the One M9+ contains a DuoCamera depth sensor, the One ME uses a 4-megapixel UltraPixel shooter.. The new HTC One ME also packs 3GB RAM, 32GB internal storage and microSD storage expansion for up to 2-terabytes (wow!). Also worth noting, the ME has dual-SIM capability for two nano-SIM cards.. Perhaps the most notable difference comes on the outside of the handset. The One ME's back is made of a soft-touch polycarbonate finish with aluminum edges. This presumably keeps the price point lower than that of its all-metal sibling.. The One ME runs Android with the custom Sense UI. There are two BoomSound stereo speakers and a fingerprint sensor on the front as well.. It is not immediately clear where or when the One ME will sell, though it will probably keep to Asia..

ME and M9+ specifications are almost same. But there are few important differences. M9+ comes with a single SIM slot but ME has dual SIM option. But on the other side, ME does not have OTG and super LCD3 display quality like M9+. Therefore, the price is also little lower in this one. Otherwise, camera, RAM, ROM, graphics, video quality, overall speed and battery performance is same and as great as One M9+.. User Rating: 3.15 ( 20 votes). HTC One ME Rating by MobileDokan.

Fingerprint, Blinkfeed and New Sense 7. shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter. HTC has had a tough year, tough decisions and a lot of devices. The company has had the slowest quarter yet and the stock prices have dropped to an all time low. The company also reported a net loss of $258 Million, which points to the fact that the company is not doing well.. However that has not stopped HTC from making new handsets, and in countries like India, the HTC market share is growing considerably.. The HTC One ME, adds fuel to the HTC fire in India, a handset that brings the best of the flagship world. The HTC One ME is a good mix of things from HTC. 40000 or US $ 630 (outright) the phone makes a lot of sense to people. However the use of mediate is slightly bothersome to the tech crowd, especially at such high prices.. The HTC One ME has almost everything from the HTC One M9+ including most of the hardware. The One ME uses the new MediaTek Helio X10 and is also the first phone with the said chipset. This enables devices to utilise full octal-cores at 2.2 GHz in 64 bit and also shoots high quality videos at upto 480 frames/sec. It allows a 120 Hz video display rate too.. Apart from that you will get 3 GB of RAM, a brilliant 2k display with 5.2 inch size, a. 2560×1440 px resolution and 565 ppi.. The same camera as the One M9, a 20 MP. f2.2 lens equipped sensor, and an HTC ultra pixel sensor for the front.. The display on the new ME is the same as the M9+, excellent colours, deep blacks and great outdoor visibility. The touch is highly sensitive and even works when there is water on the display or if your fingers are wet. You will also get features like double tap to turn on. The display is great for all sorts of usage like watching movies, playing games or even browsing the internet. The high resolution makes content optimized for this look, great and the strain on the eyes is reduced considerably.. Boomsound speakers have always had this ability to be better than the remaining devices in the price segment and that continues with the new One ME. Sound is excellent in the headphones, out speakers or via bluetooth. Volumes are kept high and bass levels deep, almost as if the profile is the same as the old ones when HTC handsets would ship with “Beats Audio,” however, only better.. The camera lens and sensor are relatively large, hence a lot of light passes through to get a really high detail image. The images have excellent contrast and sharpness, shallow depth of field on close ups and a large zoom ratio thanks to the large 20.1 MP size of the rear camera.. 4k video can be captured in 5 minute bursts, which gets annoying for those looking for a seamless solution. There are alternatives, devices which do not have said limits including the one we chose for our project here. Video is jitter free and captured at 30fps and it looks good, as the colour is deep and light is aptly adjusted.. The Camera App is in-depth and features a lot of the capabilities of HTC devices seen in the past, galleries and Zoe are now independent apps with independent cloud storages. This complicates things for first time users, but in the longer run, makes sense. You also get the usual filters and effects along with post capture edits, which were all a part of HTC’s Sense.. The handset scores roughly 46-48k on Antutu 64 Bit benchmark, which is impressive taking into consideration, the price. However, most of the performance which may not appear on benchmarks can been seen in real time usage.. The handset will almost never lag. In the 2 weeks of usage, the handset has not slowed down and transitions remain smooth, despite consuming large parts of the storage and or RAM.. Gaming remains impressive, the 120 Hz refresh rate of the display helps tremendously. Boom sound adds to the experience and so does the impressive touch screen. The good thing is that the device does not heat up despite increased usage, or high periods of gaming.. The HTC One ME accepts dual LTE sim cards, both of which need to be nano sim cards. Network strength is great and so is the audio on both sides. Both sim cards can run LTE data packs and can be switched, depending on your convenience or usage scenarios.. Battery life was impressive due to high levels of optimizations and range point locks. Despite several rumours of poor battery life, we did not face any such issues with the handset. On our handset, the battery life was rather impressive. We got an average of One day plus use. Another thing to brag about is the quick charge capability of the handset. The One ME reaches a full charge in just over an hour, 50% recharge can be achieved in about 15 minutes of time.. The new style fingerprint scanner utilised by HTC is better by leaps and bounds. Versus the previous ten scanners, which required you to slide your finger across, the new “Apple Touch ID” style scanners are efficient and very usable. This makes your phone private and safe. You can easily unlock your device in the presence of others, without revealing your passwords or unlock patterns.. The new Blinkfeed is far more seamless and smooth. The UI is easy and very pleasing to the eye, HTC has improved the layout of the content and things like fonts and colours have been tweaked to appear easy to the eye. You can now simplify content and chose what feeds you want, within your Blinkfeed. You can also set up custom channels for the same, to allow you to reach directly to your favourite feeds.. Sense 7 is a mega improvement over previous Sense UIs, more because of the way pure android is available to the consumer. The UI is far more simplified and streamlined, less invasive and does not come loaded with bloatware. Essentials like the “Zoe” feature and the “One Gallery” are cloud-only apps that serve a simple purpose.. Customisation has been HTC’s forté and it. remains so, in the new Sense 7 on the new HTC One ME. The UI is extensively modifiable, and if you don’t like the BlinkFeed on the left you can simply use a third party launcher and replace it all.. HTC may not have gotten a lot of things right this year, but their devices in the Indian market show that the company has chosen the right things at the right time.. The HTC One ME is one such example. With Snapdragon not performing well on their current lineup of chipsets, HTC went with MediaTek and their latest “premium” chipsets. This has made the devices a lot more stable. However, this has also made one handset considerably vary from another. Some report of lag and battery drain while others, like us, appreciate the long battery life on our handset.. MediaTek aside, the HTC One ME is the plastic equivalent of the all round phone. The impressive display, great camera, excellent battery and seamless performance on our handset, makes us want to like it a lot. Just like any other scenario alternates do exist and with the S6 becoming cheap, a fixed storage and single sim is something that may make you pick the HTC One ME with its Dual Sim and 2TB expandability. However the S6 performs better and looks damn good.. shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter.

This phone is really a great investment for a person who is looking for good sound quality and good camera….. one thing I did not like about this phone was when I started to play high definition games for example Asphalt and Real Racing 3 the HTC One me became very hard to control especially when dropping down the notification slide it showed some of the worst lagging problems that I have ever came upon……another thing that I have noticed after I bought this phone is that they have not been any system updates for the betterment of this phone ….

(Photo: Facebook/ HTC One M9) HTC One M9. It's hasn't even been three months since HTC announced its One M9 flagship smartphone, but the manufacturer has already released a handful of versions of it.. According to a report by GSM Arena, the latest of these versions is the One ME, which has just been announced to hit the Chinese market.. So what does this HTC handset have to offer?. In the report, the device will feature the same 5.2-inch display as the One M9, but with a much better QHD or 2K (2560 x 1440) resolution screen.. In addition, the smartphone also has 3GB of RAM, a 64-bit MediaTek Helio X10 chipset, and an octa-core CPU clocked at 2.2GHz.. At the back of the device is a high-end 20MP primary camera that can capture UHD or 4K videos and clips. In front is 'only' a 4MP shooter, but it is powered by HTC's UltraPixels.. One of the main differences of the One ME from the One M9 design-wise is the presence of a physical home button. As a result, the BoomSound speaker at the lower part of the front has been divided in half.. Other specs of the newly announced device include a dual-SIM support, 4G LTE connectivity, NFC, and a 2,840mAh battery.. Unfortunately, there are still no details whether the device will hit other markets outside of China..

Digit Mobile Phones HTC HTC One ME (Dual-SIM) HTC One ME (Dual-SIM) Review. HTC One ME (Dual-SIM) Review. Published Date | Last Updated. Our Verdict HTC One ME (Dual-SIM): Detailed Review HTC One ME. HTC One ME (Dual-SIM) Price in India 40500/- Set Price Drop Alert. HTC One ME (Dual-SIM) review: Everything is brilliant, except for performance when running heavy applications and a weak battery. A big flaw for a flagship.. Yes, the HTC One ME (Dual-SIM) does look and feel like a device that costs 40 grand. The camera is decent, audio quality on the speakers (and on better earphones) is really good, and daily tasks like browsing, texting and lightweight games are a breeze. But it fails when it comes to heavier games, and HTC’s Sense UI fails to invoke the suave flow that much cheaper devices like Xiaomi’s Mi 4 and the OnePlus One do. Plus, with the excellent Samsung Galaxy S6 currently available for the same price (Rs. 1,000 cheaper, actually), it’s really hard to find a reason to recommend the HTC One ME Dual-SIM to anyone.. PROS Great design Good camera and audio quality. CONS Weak battery Performance lags in gaming, multi-tasking.

HTC One ME (Dual-SIM) is currently available at the best price of: ₹29,325. I have always liked the way HTC smartphones look (although they all look somewhat similar now). Out of the box, I loved the HTC One ME. We got the dual-tone Rose Gold version of this newly-released smartphone. Although the use of matte white on the back didn't really impress, I was ready to overlook it because of the beautiful rose gold metal finish, and how comfortable the phone felt in hand despite its size. The back has a pleasing curve that makes the phone fit into palms really well.. The HTC One ME is indeed beautiful to look at. I love the immaculate finish, the uber-responsive and accurate fingerprint scanner, the way the LED indicator blinks out of a single block in the earpiece mesh. It does look its price, for sure. But, a few days later, I cannot really say that I am equally pleased with the way the One ME (Dual-SIM) works. HTC has built the One ME really well. Clad entirely in metal on its front and sides, with a matte plastic back that feels smooth and immaculate in touch and feel. The rounded edges give a seamless touch to its design, and is complemented well by the curved back that makes the phone fit into your palm. The white back with the rose gold metal, though, was somewhat of a game spoiler for me. Personally, the white somewhat kills the shine of the rose gold front. I found the other two colours (Gold Sepia and Meteor Grey) to look better.. The screen takes up almost the entire space up front. The earpiece mesh, ambient light sensor and front camera are above the screen. The front camera has a shiny metal ring around it, and the notification light is housed inside the earpiece mesh. Below the screen, the home button doubles-up as a super-responsive and accurate fingerprint sensor, and has dual speaker grills. At the back, a slightly protruding camera lens with dual-colour flash to its left and the ‘HTC’ logo adorn the back panel.. The HTC One ME will impress anyone the first time around. Around its edges, the microUSB/charging port is at the bottom of the phone, with the 3.5mm headphone port to its right. To the left, a plastic flap hides the hot-swappable dual-SIM slots. The top edge has the infrared sensor, and to the right, there’s another flap hiding the memory expansion slot, the volume rocker and the power button. Although I did get used to it in about a day’s use, the volume rocker and the power button were placed too close to each other. Often, I found myself pressing the volume down button instead of the power button. The buttons were also a bit too recessed into the phone’s casing. These are very tiny aspects, of course. But when you are spending more than Rs. 40,000 for a phone, you would really want every single thing to be perfect, wouldn’t you?. The HTC One ME packs a 5.2” Super LCD3 display at a resolution of. It is crisp, and anyone with an eye for detail will love watching movies on it. Brightness is ample, and sunlight visibility is excellent. Viewing angles are not compromised either. Overall, you will not find anything to complain about this display.. That said, however, I’m not a fan of the Sense UI. It retains Android’s notification panel, and lets you customise your home screens. The excellent resolution of the display means that until this point, everything looks and feels perfect. The App screen, however, fails to retain the premium feel that was so beautifully continued till now. It drags you down to an average level for all HTC smartphones, and that is something that I didn’t really like. The touch response is really smooth and accurate, and at times the phone felt unreasonably fast.. Swipe to the extreme left of your screen and you get HTC BlinkFeed, that gives you a curated news feed of latest updates from all around the world. the main Home screen, the widgets panel gives you three view choices - Home, Work and Out. HTC curates the options based on your usage - yet again, pretty neat. There are no physical functionality buttons, and the on-screen ones are fast, responsive and accurate enough, so you won’t miss them. The HTC One ME is powered by the MediaTek Helio X10 octa-core processor clocked at 2.2GHz, which looks pretty powerful on the spec sheet. It is supplemented with 3GB of RAM, and this makes daily real world usage a breeze. The 32GB of internal memory is the least one could ask for in this price range, and HTC even packs in an expandable memory option of 2TB.. Surfing, streaming music and videos, messaging and mailing are absolute delights on this phone. I could easily surf my Facebook News Feed with apps updating in the background, while talking on the phone. There was not a single hint of a stutter. It did, however, heat up considerably after about fifteen minutes of continuously carrying out these three tasks together. That can be forgiven, because continuous multi-tasking burns a lot of battery too, and even the heat wasn’t unbearable.. When it came to gaming, however, is where I faced my first obstacle with the One ME. Both WWE Superstars and Asphalt 8 became jittery after about ten minutes - somewhat of a surprise for me. There was also a very drastic battery drop, and the entire device started heating up. This is where the HTC One ME hits a dead-end, and a pretty major one. Running Photoshop Express continuously on this device once again became difficult, and edited photographs started taking up to 10 seconds to be saved to the device. It felt like a major shame that a device that costs so much was not able to run heavier applications properly, but sadly, that is the case.. Music playback, however, brings me back to complimenting the device yet again. HTC does a good job with its BoomSound technology with Dolby Audio. The dual speakers produce good, balanced audio quality. The highs are not shrill, and the lows do not impose the bassline of a track over the entire song. Select the Music mode before playing your songs out loud, and you’ll be happy with the audio quality. is a bit on the higher side - possibly to aid dialogues, and it is justified. The speakers are not excessively loud, either. But, having said that, they are loud enough, and there is no hint of muted sound coming out of the speaker grills. The in-box earphones, however, were a major disappointment for me. Firstly, they kept getting disconnected when I moved too much with the headphones on (maybe this was just a manufacturing defect in the set that we received for review, and we really hope so). Apart from that, the plastic build feels somewhat cheap, and the audio quality is no great winner either. The audio is mostly driven by the highs, and in a few tracks, the bassline was really weak. This is a flaw in the earphones and not the phone’s audio driver. Teaming the One ME with my favourite headphones resulted in delightful audio quality.. The HTC One ME failed to score high in the synthetic benchmarks, and that came as no surprise after the lags that it encounters in heavy applications. Here’s the score graph for benchmarks, and as you can clearly see, it is a. HTC One ME (Dual-SIM) | Create infographics. The HTC One ME packs a 2840mAh battery, which is, to say the least, miserable. Streaming and playing videos, playing games or any type of video-intensive work results in drastic battery drops, and battery tests in benchmark scores and our test both revealed a fairly poor battery life. The high resolution of the screen is probably the biggest reason for the weak battery, and you need to make sure that you always carry your power bank around if you’re using the One ME as your primary device. If you’re a light user, then it might last you a day, but the most I could make it last with a usual day’s use is just a little more than five hours. Even our battery test revealed a battery life of 4.8 hours. The camera app is smooth and the interface is simple enough to figure out all the controls. The 20-megapixel BSI sensor with a lens aperture of f/2.2 produces decent photographs, without much compensation in clarity. Focusing was also a fairly smooth deal, although you really need to pinpoint your focus area in areas with low/bad light. The photographs retain colour accuracy in all modes except for the warm white balance, where the overall image still looks rather bluish. Overall, though, the Samsung Galaxy S6's camera beats the HTC One ME hands-down.. The 4-megapixel UltraPixel sensor on the front camera is something that HTC has been trying out for a while, and it does take good self-portraits, and even the video quality from the front camera is quite decent. I was actually quite happy with the low-light capability of the front camera. In the end, I really had nothing to complain about the camera performance, except that anything you do on this device will gobble up your battery, and sadly, that is a problem that might detract many takers.. There’s plenty to admire about the HTC One ME (dual-SIM). The build quality is excellent, audio is superbly balanced, camera quality is good, and using it for all the regular purposes is a sheer delight. But it fails miserably in two major tasks - heavy multitasking and battery life, and this takes a lot of praise away from it. You might consider buying it if you don’t load too many heavy games and applications on your device, have Rs. 40,500 to spare and want a very good looking phone with an excellent screen. But even then, with the excellent Samsung Galaxy S6 currently available for the same price (Rs. 1,000 cheaper, actually), it’s really hard to find a reason to recommend the HTC One ME Dual-SIM to anyone..

No Expert reviews found for this mobile.. Good Phone specs with poor battery. I had purchased the phone in Sept 2016. In the starting it had good performance (still it is going good on performance). now the battery is hardly lasts half a day.. Great Camera Awesome Display Superior looks Finger print sensor Processor is good IR Blaster Boom Speakers. Sometime lag in performance, RAM management should have been better. Worst battery backup Overheating issues No software updates. Great phone but every thing wrong with it. The phone gets hot after watching YouTube for 5 min can't use for anything with more than 5 mins. Great display, no lagging,built quality is great. Can't use the phone for more than 5 mins. One of the best smart phones.. Camera Build quality Resolution Processor UI. Little bit heating while playing games. A phone worth buying for someone who is willing to shell out few extra thousands to get flagship like experience .... and great looks Dual SIM ( not many high end smartphones allow that) 32 GB internal memory ( which is upgradeable ) Fast processor (despite being a mediatek) smooth multi tasking fingerprint scanner works great 3 GB RAM ... moderate heating while playing games battery consumption ( though one can easily juice out a day on normal 3G usage, audio, calls ). Although HTC gives best in class mobile phones, this phone lags a little bit as compared w.r.t. The UI does not give friendly user experience. 3GB RAM is just an average while giving this much price. Also it is not giving Marshmallow version upgrading option.. Back camera is quite good , also in low light. Front camera is not good in low light. It is having Li-Po non-removable battery which does not last long as compared with Li-ion battery. HTC could have given Snapdragon processor instead of Mediatek.. Enter each Pro in new line..
