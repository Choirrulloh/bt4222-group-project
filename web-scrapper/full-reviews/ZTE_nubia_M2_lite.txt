Nubia M2, M2 Lite, N2 Smartphones With 16-Megapixel Front Cameras Launched. Gadgets 360 Staff , 22 March 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Nubia M2 sports a dual rear camera setup, the first from the brand. Nubia M2 Lite is similar in many ways to the Nubia M2. All three smartphones run Nubia UI 4.0 with different Android versions. ZTE brand Nubia on Tuesday launched three new smartphones in its home market, China, namely – Nubia M2 , Nubia M2 Lite , and Nubia N2. All three smartphones will be available in Black and Gold colour variants. The M2 and M2 Lite, which have been priced starting at CNY 2,699 (roughly Rs. 27,000) and CNY 1,799 (roughly Rs. 18,000) respectively will be available soon, while the Nubia N2, which has been priced at CNY 1,999 (roughly Rs. 19,000), will be available from April 8.. All three new Nubia smartphones sport 5.5-inch displays, but with differing resolutions, and all three also support dual-SIM cards in a hybrid dual-SIM configuration. The smartphones all run Nubia UI 4.0, but based on different versions of Android. Let's start with the Nubia M2, which is the first smartphone from the company’s stables to sport a dual rear camera setup.. The Nubia M2 (seen above) runs Nubia UI 4.0 based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, and sports a 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) AMOLED display. It is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 SoC that’s coupled with 4GB of RAM. Coming to the cameras, as we mentioned, the Nubia M2 bears a dual rear camera setup with dual-LED flash. It features 13-megapixel sensors, with one capturing colour information and the other capturing monochrome information, both with sapphire glass protection and an f/2.2 aperture. On the front, it has a 16-megapixel camera with an f/2.0 aperture and an 80-degree wide-angle lens.. Other Nubia M2 specifications include 64GB or 128GB of inbuilt storage (latter model is priced at CNY 29,999 – which is roughly Rs. ) that’s expandable via microSD card (up to 200GB), and 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth v4.1, USB Type-C, and GPS connectivity options. It runs on a 3630mAh battery with NeoPower fast charging support. It bears a fingerprint sensor on the home button and support for Dolby Sound 7.1 and Hi-Fi audio.. The Nubia M2 Lite (seen above) has several similarities to the Nubia M2, but there are notable differences. It bears a lower resolution (HD – 720x1280 pixels), IPS display, is powered by a MediaTek Helio P10 SoC, and comes in 3GB RAM/ 32GB storage and 4GB RAM/ 64GB storage variants with storage expandable via microSD card (up to 128GB). It foregoes the dual rear camera setup, and uses a single 13-megapixel sensor with an f/2.2 aperture and dual-LED flash. It also bears a smaller 3000mAh battery with fast charging support, and supports Hi-Fi audio with DTS 7.1 sound. It measures 155.73x76.7x7.5mm and weighs 164 grams. It runs Nubia UI 4.0 based on Android 7.0 Nougat.. Finally, we come to the Nubia N2 (seen below). The smartphone runs Nubia UI 4.0 based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and sports a 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) AMOLED display. It is powered by a MediaTek octa-core SoC coupled with 4GB of RAM. As for optics, it bears a 13-megapixel rear camera with f/2.2 aperture, PDAF, and dual-LED flash, apart from a 16-megapixel front camera. It offers 64GB of inbuilt storage, and standard connectivity options including 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth v4.1, GPS, USB Type-C, and 3.5mm audio jack. It is powered by a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support that’s rated to deliver up to 60 hours of talk time..
