Nokia 6 (2018) - user opinions and reviews. So Xperia XA2 and Nokia 6 has equal price, I'll buy XA2 due to smaller size, although I love Nokia too.. There are some datas which should be updated as the phone is equipped with NFC facility and the rear camera shoots at 4k resolution (both info confirmed on Nokia's official website). Even if dont have NFC ... who cares? no-one give them a real usage so i can live without NFC XD.

Nokia 6 (2018) is official: coming with OZO Audio and “Bothie” photo mode for $230. by Matt Adams January 5, 2018. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Nokia 6 (2018) price and release date. Following yesterday’s substantial leak, the Nokia 6 (2018) has now been announced. The device will be officially known as the Nokia 6 (second-generation) and, as was hinted at yesterday, it will feature most of the same specs as the previous handset and arrive with the 13-month-old Android Nougat OS.. The biggest changes to this edition of the Nokia 6 are the inclusion of a. Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 chip (the previous model had a Snapdragon 430),. OZO Audio recording technology, and a “Bothie” photo mode — more on which you can learn about below. the Nokia 6 (2018) will indeed come with a USB Type-C port. Earlier leaks pointed toward a microUSB port, so we’re pleasantly surprised to see a Type-C port here.. The handset is available for pre-booking from today in China in 32 GB and 64 GB configurations for $230 and $245 respectively and will be released on January 10. We don’t have any further information on a wider release yet, but we’ll hopefully learn more at CES 2018 next week. Find out everything else you need to know about the device in the original coverage.. Just a day before its official launch, the Nokia 6 (2018) has leaked in full. (via GSMArena ) posted a listing for the device early, and let us in on what we can expect tomorrow, January 5.. Year one: The good and bad of Nokia’s return to smartphones. Exactly one year ago, HMD Global gained the rights to make and sell smartphones under the Nokia brand.. The Finnish company made great progress in its first year of business. It got what was once the …. The device will come with a 5.5-inch 1080p display and a classic 16:9 aspect ratio. Under the hood, it’ll include an octa-core Snapdragon 630 processor, an Adreno. 508 GPU, and 4 GB of RAM. The device will also house either 32 GB or 64 GB of internal storage that can be expanded via microSD card by another 128 GB.. As for the cameras, it will include a 16 MP f/2.0 main shooter on the rear of the device, while up front we will see an 8 MP f/2.0 sensor. This is the same camera setup as on the 2017 Nokia 6 , however, this time the device will come with Nokia’s. A Bothie is a picture or video that is captured out of both the front and the rear cameras and placed side-by-side. To beef up its video capabilities, Nokia is also including OZO Audio recording on the 2nd gen Nokia 6. According to Nokia, OZO Audio is, “an advanced spatial audio technology with 3D capture and playback capabilities.”. Just under the rear camera will sit a fingerprint scanner. This is a change from the original Nokia 6 which had its scanner on the front of the device. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Nokia shrunk the scanner-less front bezel, it just simply moved the scanner to the rear.. Two areas of potential disappointment we see are the charging port and OS version. The 3,000 mAh battery will be recharged via a microUSB port on the bottom of the phone. Even cheaper devices in the last year have moved to USB Type-C ports, so we could understand some fans being disappointed to still see a microUSB port here.. Surprise: The Nokia 2 will get Android 8.1. Nokia 2, HMD Global's budget Android offering, was released just a couple months ago and as such, it seems reasonable to conclude that the phone would receive an OS upgrade in due time.. Additionally, the Nokia 6 (2018) looks will ship with Android 7.1.1 Nougat. Nokia is pushing Android 8.0 Oreo to some of its other devices and says it’ll update this device “soon”. Still, it’s a bit disappointing that the device will ship with an OS that came out 13 months ago.. As for the dimensions, the phone measures 148.8 x 75.8 x 8.15 mm and. will weigh in at 172 g.. The handset will come in either black with gold accents or white with red accents, and costs roughly CNY 1,499 (~$230) for the base model. Moving up to the 64 GB version will bump the price up to CNY1,699 (~$260).. Last year, the Nokia 6 was announced in January but didn’t make its way to the U.S. Nokia will release the Nokia 6 (2018) exclusively in China to begin with, on January 10, but we’ll keep our. eyes peeled as a global variant may be on the way too..

Nokia 6 (2018) is official and ships with a Snapdragon 630. The updated Nokia 6 is here, and it fixes our biggest issue with last year's model.. On January 4, a Chinese retailer leaked the 2018 Nokia 6 in all of its glory – including specs, press shots, and more. Just a day later, Nokia has officially listed the handset on its website to confirm most of what we've already seen.. As we previously saw, the design of the Nokia 6 hasn't changed all that much from year to year. The phone's still made out of an aluminum unibody with rounded corners, but the fingerprint sensor has been moved to the back in favor of slightly slimmer bezels. Also as a result of this, last year's capacitive navigation buttons are gone and replaced with on-screen ones.. The Nokia 6 (2018) might not look like a huge improvement over the 2017 version at first glance, but that's because the most important upgrade lies under the hood. Our biggest complaint with the last year's Nokia 6 was that it shipped with the underpowered Snapdragon 430, but this time around, there's a much more capable Snapdragon 630 that's paired with 4GB of RAM.. There's still a 5.5-inch 1920 x 1080 display, 16MP rear camera, and 3,000 mAh battery, and while the Nokia 6 (2018) will ship with Android 7.1.1 Nougat , Nokia says that an update to Oreo is in the works. Also new is a USB Type-C port compared to the older microUSB we saw last year.. The 32GB Nokia 6 will cost CNY 1,499 and the 64GB model will be slightly more expensive at CNY 1,699 (€191 and €216, respectively). Pre-orders are set to begin on January 10 in China, and an expanded release to other markets (including the United States) will likely happen later in the year..

Nokia 6 (2018) With Rear Fingerprint Sensor, Snapdragon 630 Launched: Price, Release Date, Specifications. Jagmeet Singh , 05 January 2018. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Nokia 6 (2018) does not feature the new 18:9 display trend most smartphones have adopted. Nokia 6 (2018) will be available in China on January 10. The smartphone comes with a starting price of CNY 1,499. It features a rear-facing fingerprint scanner. After a bunch of leaks and rumours , HMD Global has now formally announced the Nokia 6 (2018) as its first smartphone of the new year. The new Nokia smartphone is the successor to the last year's Nokia 6 and is debuting in China. Details about its global rollout are yet to emerge. However, the smartphone is quite likely to go on sale in India following the initial availability in the Chinese market. China's Suning has started taking pre-orders for the Nokia 6 (2018), and its sale will begin starting January 10. The 32GB Nokia 6 (2018) variant will be available with a price tag of CNY 1,499 (roughly Rs. 14,600), whereas its 64GB variant will come at CNY 1,699 (approximately Rs. Both the variants will come in Black and Silver colour options.. Unlike the original Nokia 6 model that was launched back in January last year with a front-facing fingerprint scanner, the Nokia 6 (2018) features a fingerprint scanner on the back. The new smartphone has also dropped the capacitive keys that were available on alongside the frontal fingerprint scanner on the previous Nokia handset. The Finnish manufacturer has apparently chosen on-screen navigation to make the interface of the new Nokia 6 closer to stock Android UI. The decision is conspicuous as it has maintained a 16:9 display aspect ratio, and not used a 18:9 aspect ratio that was the primary cause of other manufacturers ditching front fingerprint scanners and hardware capacitive buttons. Further, the Nokia 6 (2018) has a metal unibody build that is made of 6000 series aluminium.. The dual-SIM (Nano) Nokia 6 (2018) runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box. The handset is also expected to receive an update to Android 8.0 Oreo sometime in the future. But the company hasn't so far provided any official details on the latest Android update. On the display part, the Nokia 6 (2018) features a 5.5-inch IPS display with a full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) resolution and 16:9 aspect ratio. The smartphone is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 SoC, which is clocked at 2.2GHz, coupled with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. Also, the internal storage of the new Nokia 6 is upgradable via microSD card slot (up to 128GB) in a hybrid dual-SIM configuration.. HMD Global has provided a 16-megapixel rear camera sensor on the Nokia 6 (2018) with dual-tone LED flash and PDAF lens that has f/2.0 aperture. Similarly, an 8-megapixel camera is available on the front with an f/2.0, 84-degree wide-angle lens. The smartphone also supports the company's proprietary Dual-Sight technology that allows you to capture simultaneous shots from the rear and front camera sensors to create a Bothie. In terms of connectivity, the smartphone has FM radio, 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, Bluetooth v5, GPS/ A-GPS, USB Type-C, and 3.5mm audio jack.. Besides, the Nokia 6 (2018) packs a 3000mAh battery that supports fast charging technology. It measures 148.8x75.8x8.6mm and weighs 172 grams..

HMD announces an all new Nokia 6 for 2018 at Mobile World Congress. HMD Global, official maker of Nokia-branded smartphones, has unveiled a refreshed version of last year’s Nokia 6 smartphone at Mobile World Congress. This year’s update brings some modest specification improvements, as well as slight design changes and the introduction of Android One.. The phone launched in China earlier this year, but the model announced at MWC is the global version. It’s unclear what countries the Nokia 6 will head to, but here’s what you need to know.. The bezels on the 2018 Nokia 6 are marginally smaller than its predecessor, but it. The fingerprint sensor has moved to the rear to accomodate for the smaller bezels on the front. We recently saw Honor bring the bezel-less future to the budget market with the Honor 7X , and mid-range phones like the OnePlus 5T have seen the bezel-less trend expand beyond flagship phones like the LG V30 , the Galaxy S8 , and the iPhone X. There are plenty of options here for mid-range or budget bezel-less phones.. While the body of the 2018 Nokia 6 is slightly smaller than its predecessor, you wouldn’t notice the difference unless you held the devices side by side. The Nokia 6 is still made from a single aluminum unibody, with a metal frame surrounding the body.. The display in the 2018 Nokia 6 is similar to last year’s model. It sports the same 5.5-inch FHD display with a 16:9 aspect ratio. Screen resolution comes in at a standard 1,920 x 1,080 pixels.. The internal changes on the 2018 Nokia 6 aren’t as subtle. The Snapdragon 430 core on last year’s Nokia 6. has been upgraded to a Snapdragon 630 for 2018, which should offer up to a 60 percent bump in performance. Two different configurations are available: One with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, or 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. A MicroSD slot is available and can support up to 128GB of external storage. There’s also a 3,000mAh battery on board.. Don’t expect a huge change for the camera on the updated Nokia 6, though. The rear camera is the same 16-megapixel lens, now with Zeiss optics. The 8 megapixel front-facing camera features an 84-degree wide-angle lens. You’ll also find Dual-sight technology on the Nokia 6. With Dual-sight you can use the front and rear-facing cameras simultaneously to create “bothies,” which is a photo take with both cameras.. The Nokia 6 will be a part of the Android One lineup, which means it features stock Android 8.0 Oreo with no bloatware, and access to fast software updates.. The Nokia 6 will launch in April 2018, and it will cost 280 euros. There’s no word on a U.S. launch just yet, but it’s likely considering the 2017 Nokia 6 was one of few to make it stateside.. Updated on February 25: Confirmed information with HMD for global release.. Here are all the Nokia phones HMD Global unveiled at MWC 2018. Nokia 9 rumors suggest a strong 2018 for the reinvigorated company. Big-screen Nokia 7 Plus featuring Android One announced at Mobile World Congress.

Images of Nokia 6 (2018) added to listing. Yesterday we told you the Nokia 6 successor arrived on TENAA, a required step before a device hits the Chinese market. At that point there was not much to the listing, but this morning the Chinese regulatory also uploaded images of the phone. It will have 18:9 screen, and since there is no room for a fingerprint scanner on the front, it will move on the back, below the camera.. The Nokia 6 (2018) will have one camera, with the actual setup looking a lot like the long one in the Nokia 5. There are also discreet antenna bands on the top and bottom and an orange accent around the camera.. The front is occupied mainly by the screen, but there is room for an earpiece, selfie camera and the Nokia logo on the top. The images also reveal some side bezels, most likely due to the taller display. Even though it is hard to get what surface will the phone have, it will most likely be the same aluminum unibody.. Nokia 6 (2018) passes through TENAA, getting closer to release. New Nokia phones (TA-1062 and TA-1077) get certified in China. Nokia 7 in Matte White to be available in China next week. Nokia 8 starts getting Android Oreo. Looks like somebody else needs those glasses.. Hopefully you are right about the 630 as this would be a step up that fans wanted and the price will probably go up too. But I have a suspicion that a new 450 could be used. That is pretty much a 625 slightly underclocked and would have a good price.... This is a must get phone for me..

Hours after the new Nokia 6 was leaked , HMD Global has made the device official.. The Nokia 6 (2018) may look similar to last year's model , but there are a few changes worth knowing about. The first is that the new Nokia 6 has ditched the capacitive buttons found on last year's version, meaning that you're getting on-screen navigation buttons here.. The second big change is the fingerprint reader. With the capacitive buttons gone, that means that the front fingerprint reader has been moved. It's now a rear fingerprint reader, placed directly below the rear camera setup.. Also of note is that the Nokia 6 (2018) packs an upgraded processor over its predecessor. While last year's Nokia 6 had a Snapdragon 430 chipset, the new Nokia 6 is rocking a Snapdragon 630 processor.. Other features of the Nokia 6 (2018) include a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 display, 4GB of RAM, 32/64GB of storage, and a microSD slot for adding more storage. There's a 3,000mAh battery powering the whole package and a USB-C port for recharging that battery. And yes, there's a 3.5mm headphone jack on there, too.. The rear camera of the new Nokia 6 features a 16-megapixel sensor with an f/2.0 aperture and dual LED flash, while the front camera is an 8-megapixel sensor with f/2.0 aperture and wide angle lens. Also included is a dual-view mode that'll let you use the front and rear cameras simultaneously when capturing photos and videos.. On the software side, the Nokia 6 (2018) runs Android 7.1.1, but it's upgradeable to Android 8.0 Oreo.. The new Nokia 6 will go on sale in China on January 10th. Pricing will start at CNY1499 ($231 USD) for the 4GB/32GB model and go up to CNY1699 ($262 USD) for the 4GB/64GB model. There's no word on when or if the Nokia 6 will expand to other markets.. This updated Nokia 6 looks like a solid Android offering. It retained the aluminum unibody design of its predecessor while upgrading the RAM and processor, and it's got a price tag that's pretty nice for what you're getting. Hopefully we'll see two things for this new Nokia 6 in the near future: an Oreo update and wider availability..

Nokia 9, Nokia 8 (2018) & Nokia 6 (2018): LEAKED, Listed & Tipped For January 2018 Launch. Nokia is prepping three phones for launch in mid-January 2018, including the Nokia 9. The Nokia 9 and Nokia 6 (2018) have both popped up in certification documents in China, strongly hinting at a January launch for the two new Android phones.. This news, together with a broadening pool of leaks and tips regarding Nokia/HMD's 2018 plans, would appear to confirm that not only will HMD finally launch the Nokia 9 in early 2018, but the entire 2017 Nokia Android line-up will seemingly get a reboot for then new year too, or at least, a large chunk of them.. So far, most of the leaked details suggest that all the new models will be rocking the ever trendy 18:9 aspect ratio display panels. We know the Nokia 9 will be much like the Nokia 8 with a big 18:9 display and waterproofing, however, there is also a Nokia 8 (2018) on the way as spotted in multiple leaks, which would also appear to have an 18:9 display as well (thought we're not clear on if other 2018 re-boots including the Nokia 8 will have the Nokia 9's waterproofing feature). Some of this seems a little strange to us as there's a lot of scope for cannibalisation here.. Anyway, the freshly spotted certification documents list a. TA-1054, which is thought to be the Nokia 6 (2018), and another phone listed as the. TA-1042, which may or may not be the Nokia 9. The Nokia 9 has also been listed as the. TA-1005 and TA-1009, but it is possible we're looking at multiple regional variants and different capabilities, such as different network calibration or dual-SIM functions.. Nokia has an event lined up for January 19, and it's suspected it may launch the Nokia 9, as well as one or more Nokia 2018 re-boots - the Nokia 8 (2018) has been tipped for this previously. It's worth noting the current Nokia 6 launched on January 19 2017.. The Nokia 6 (2018) was also spotted in Chinese TENAA listings, including images and specs, both of which show an 18:9 display and a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. It has a single sensor camera too.. All The VERY BEST iPhone Apps For 2018. Nokia 7 Plus Leaked In Product Renders. Samsung Galaxy S9 & Galaxy S9+: All You Need To Know.

Here's all the new things brought by the Nokia 6 2018. A year has passed since HMD unveiled Nokia’s first comeback smartphone in China, the Nokia 6 , so this week the Finnish company has taken the wraps off an updated version of the phone destined to be sold in the same region.. The second generation Nokia 6 brings only a few improvements over its predecessor and in what follows we’re going to take a look at what sets it apart from the original version.. At a glance, the Nokia 6 (2018) looks quite akin the original model, although a few key aspects have changed. The phone still comes featuring a 5.5-inch IPS fullHD display and is based on similar aluminum unibody design.. However, unlike last year’s model, the second-gen Nokia 6 has shed the physical home button located under the display, so the fingerprint scanner now resides on the phone’s back. Despite this change, the top and bottom bezels remain quite chunky and the phones still feature the less modern 16:9 aspect ratio.. On the back, the centered vertical camera is now surrounded by a sleek colored rim. This year, Nokia is offering the Nokia 6 in two stylish versions: black with copper highlights and white with rose gold accents. The original Nokia 6 was sold in Matte Black, Tempered Blue, Silver, and Copper, as well as an Arte Black Limited Edition version.. If last year’s Nokia 6 relied on a Snapdragon 430 (low-end 1.4GHz octa-core chip), the Nokia 6 (2018) makes the transition to solid mid-range territory by employing the help of a Snapdragon 630 (2.2GHz octa-core processor) – the same processor that powers mid-range phones such as the HTC U11 Life, Moto X4 or the ASUS Zenfone 4.. The original Nokia 6 launched with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, but the Arte Black version offered a more advanced 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage configuration.. The Nokia 6 2018, on the other hand, includes 4GB of RAM by default with either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. Both models include a microSD card slot for memory expansion up to 256GB.. Battery capacity hasn’t been upgraded this year, so both models rely on a 3,000 mAh powerhouse to keep lights on.. Things haven’t changed much in the photography department either, except with a few exceptions. The new model still has a 16-megapixel (with f/2.0) sensor living on the back and an 8-megapixel (with f/2.0) front camera (with added 84-degree wide-angle capture for the new model).. But the second-gen Nokia 6 now includes an additional microphone to support Nokia’s OZO Audio’s spatial audio capture, a feature HMD also offers on the Nokia 8 flagship. On the downside, the phone lost the second speaker in the process.. Another feature borrowed from the Nokia 8 is the Dual-Sight mode or bothie mode. This allows the phone to simultaneously film what is in front of the device, while also recording selfie videos. Useful? It’s up to you decide, but it sounds like it would be fun to try at least once.. With the Nokia 6 2018, the company decided to ditch the micro-USB port in favor of the newer USB Type-C. The good news, however, is that the 3.5mm headphone jack is still on board the new model.. What’s truly disappointing about this new phone is that it launched with Android 7.1.1 Nougat out the box – the same software version the original Nokia 6 came with almost a year ago. Obviously, HMD said the phone will get the Oreo update soon, but that’s beside the point. Why are so few new phones launching with Oreo as default operating system when Google’s latest Android version has been out for months? We will probably never know…. Like its predecessor, the Nokia 6 2018 will be a China exclusive device at launch. The 64GB version is expected to land in retail with a price of approximately $260 attached to it, while the 32GB model will be sold for around $230.. Currently, the original Nokia 6 is available in the US for $229.99 on Amazon , while the Arte Black version with 4GB of RAM is no longer on sale (it was priced at $299). So it seems this year, Nokia has priced the phone more competitively.. Even the Nokia 6 2018 will initially go on sale only in China, we expect it to land in the States, as well at some point in the future..

Share on facebook Share on twitter. Share Email Print Share Tweet Pin Linkedin Google+ Reddit. By Janna Dela Cruz , Christian Post Contributor | Dec 31, 2017 6:08 PM. It looks like the rumored next-generation Nokia 6 will come with at least two versions.. What is believed to be the second variant of smartphone with the name Nokia 6 (2018) has popped up on the Chinese certification agency TENAA. and it appears to be a lower-end version of the upcoming offering.. The first iteration that initially emerged a couple of weeks ago boasts a tall 18:9 display. However, this newly emerged device comes with a 5.5-inch screen with 16:9 aspect ratio only despite what appears to be smaller bezels on the sides.. The only other change other than this is the dimension that the device comes in. The Nokia 6 (2018) appears to be shorter in height but thicker at 148.8 x 75.8 x 8.15 mm).. The rest of the specs listed on TENAA are the same as the first Nokia 6 (2018) that paid a visit to the regulatory board prior. It will be powered by an octa-core Qualcomm processor clocked at 2.2 GHz.. It is unknown what specific model it is but it is believed that it is either Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 or the Snapdragon 660 processor. Whatever it ends up being, it will come with 4 GB of random-access memory (RAM) and 32 to 64 GB of storage.. The imaging department is not getting an upgrade though. Like the original, the Nokia 6 (2018) will sport a 16-megapixel (MP) camera on the rear and an 8 MP selfie snapper.. The new version is not getting the latest Android software either. According to TENAA, it is getting the Android 7.1.1 Nougat, which is the same version that this year's version was shipped in.. There is change planned on the battery either as the Nokia 6 (2018) will come with the same 3,000 mAh battery that its predecessor got.. It is unknown when Nokia 6 (2018) will be launched, but a TENAA visit indicates that its arrival is imminent. It is said it will be one of HMD Global's first releases for the new year..

Nokia 7 and Nokia 6 (2018) are both mid-range smartphones that were launched in China just a few months from each other. Although they look like decent devices on paper, they are not yet available outside China. The good news is that's about to change if we are to believe the latest decisions coming from the Finnish company. Apparently, HMD filed two smartphones for certification at FCC (Federal Communications Commission) that goes by model numbers: TA-1045 and TA-1016. We know for sure that these are variations of the same device since HMD confirmed the information in the documents filed at FCC. Also, the company said they these smartphones “ do not support any non-US channels in all the operational mode(s) ,” which means have been specifically modified to work in the United States solely. Apparently, these non-US frequencies have been disabled using “proprietary software,” so HMD Global should be the only entity able to reverse the process. Unfortunately, there's no way to tell whether the phone to be launched in the US is the Nokia 7 or Nokia 6 (2018) because aside from the model numbers, we only know the device is powered by a 3,000 mAh battery. Well, both Nokia smartphones mentioned have 3,000 mAh batteries, so it's hard to tell which one will make its debut in the US.. source: FCC via Nokiamob.

Nokia 6 (2018) Leaks In Images Ahead Of Its Official Launch. January 4, 2018 - Written By Kristijan Lucic. The Nokia 6 (2018) has just surfaced in several images ahead of its launch. The Nokia 6 (2018) is expected to arrive tomorrow , as HMD Global confirmed that a new phone is coming on January 5, and the Nokia 6 (2018) has been teased by the company quite a bit lately. The Nokia 6 (2018) will be a direct successor to the original Nokia 6 which was originally announced back in January last year in China.. Having said that, based on the provided images, we can see that the new Nokia 6 will resemble the original quite a bit, but its top and bottom bezels will be somewhat thinner, and the phone’s fingerprint scanner will not be placed on the device’s front side, but the company will move it to the back. Above the rear-facing fingerprint scanner, you’ll get a single camera, and an LED flash, both of which will protrude on the back a bit, it seems. The company’s branding will be placed on both the back of this smartphone, and in the phone’s top right corner, above the display, while the Nokia 6 (2018) actually got certified by TENAA (China’s equivalent to the FCC) a while back as well. Now, if that listing is to be believed, the phone will retain a 16:9 display aspect ratio, it will sport a 5.5-inch fullHD (1920 x 1080) display, while you’ll get 4GB of RAM and 32GB / 64GB of internal storage here. TENAA also mentioned that the device will offer microSD storage expansion up to 128GB, and Android 7.1.1 Nougat is expected to come pre-installed on the phone, though it is possible that Nokia may release it with Android Oreo (that is what some benchmarks suggested), after all, we’ll find out tomorrow.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. The device is said to ship with the Snapdragon 630 64-bit octa-core processor, though TENAA did not mention the SoC’s brand or anything of the sort, as per usual. A 3,000mAh non-removable battery will be a part of this package as well, and we still do not know anything about the phone’s cameras. The device will launch in Black, Blue and White color variants, if TENAA is to be believed, while it will measure 148.8 x 75.8 x 8.15mm, and weigh 172 grams. The Nokia 6 (2018) will be noticeably more powerful than its predecessor, though we’re still looking at a budget phone here.. US Cellular & Nokia Team Up On AI-Based Enterprise Tool.

Which is a better phone between Moto G5s Plus and Nokia 6 2018? And please dont recommend me any phone from Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo and Samsung?. Answered by Nikhil Paleti | 1 months ago. Both come with stock Android, so hardware is directly comparable as both don't have many individual quirks. Similar batteries are just one thing but this has much faster charging (going by advertising). This is miles ahead in Cameras as the G5S just has mediocre Cameras (No, the Dual Camera is just miserable. Processors still give almost similar day to day performance but as I saw myself, the SD 625 from the G5S hangs and can't cope well with Live Wallpapers or High Graphic indulgence. With both coming with 4GB RAM, only internal space is left, which is completely your choice based on your usage. Nokia 6 2018 is also the latest device and comes in cheaper prices (as expected). 3 more answer(s) | Spam?. What is the expected price of Nokia 6 2018?.

Press enter or click on the search icon. Will the 2018 Nokia 6 introduce this controversial new feature?. It would appear that the mid-range Nokia 6 was a hit, as Nokia – under the wing of parent company HMD Global – is preparing to release a second-generation model.. The so-called Nokia 6 (2018) was spotted on Chinese certification authority TENAA’s online database on December 12, with an ultra-tall, (near) bezel-less QHD display (18:9) and a Snapdragon 630 processor in tow.. That, as we’re sure you’d agree, is a significant improvement on the 5.5-inch Full HD screen (16:9) and Snapdragon 430 CPU found on the original Nokia 6, which launched back in January 2017.. However, it also seems Nokia might make the controversial decision to move the fingerprint-scanning physical Home button from the front – where it sat on the Nokia 6 – to the back of the 2018 Nokia 6. This is according to a listing on the Taiwanese ePrice site, though the unpredictability of Google Translate means this could well be a red herring.. Should that prove to be the case, though, we’d imagine many Nokia fans would find it to be a nuisance, as reaching each around the back of your device whenever you want to exit an application is a pain.. Concerns aside, the Android 8.0 Oreo -powered Nokia 6 (2018) is also expected to ship with 4GB of RAM as standard (up from 3GB on the Nokia 6), 32GB of expandable internal storage and a dedicated dual-SIM slot.. The 2018 Nokia 8 seems likely to launch in China and other Asian countries first, and these specs may well be revised ahead of a wider global launch.. Are you a fan of the original Nokia 6?
