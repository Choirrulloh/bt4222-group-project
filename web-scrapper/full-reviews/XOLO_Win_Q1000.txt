The Xolo Win Q1000 is a mid-range device with Windows Phone 8.1. It features a 5" 720p display, 1.2 GHz quad core CPU, 1 GB RAM, 8 GB ROM, microSD slot, 8 MP rear camera and a 2 MP front one for video calls. The phone comes with dual SIM card support.. Dimensions: 5.63 x 2.81 x 0.35 inches (143 x 71.3 x 8.8 mm). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 32.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 22.1 days (530 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 12.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 20.8 days (500 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. Data: HSDPA+ (4G) 21.1 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s, UMTS. Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

> Mobile World > Mobile OS. The update is pushed OTA (over the air) in stages. Xolo WIN Q1000 Now Receiving Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2. VPN support and Bluetooth HID have been included in the update. Microsoft has already pushed Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2 to several smartphones launched by its OEM partners. The Prestigio 8500 Duo, Yezz Billy 4.7, BLU Win HD LTE, HTC One M8 for Windows and Lava Iris Win1 already received the update a few weeks ago.. Today, another smartphone launched in India last year is getting the update, which promises to bring some new features and improvements into the mix, WMPU reports.. Xolo WIN Q1000 is the next device on the list of smartphones eligible for Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2.. Weirdly enough, Microsoft stated that the update would only be launched on Lumia 735 and Lumia 830, while Lumia 640 and Lumia 640 XL will ship with Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2 right out of the box.. Anyway, the new update adds some very useful improvements, such as Bluetooth HID for external keyboards.. This means that users will be able to take advantage of external Bluetooth keyboards by attaching them to their phones. That will certainly make typing faster and easier.. Then, the Settings menu has been tweaked so that users find their phone settings more easily.. Simply tap one of the new settings categories to jump to it, use Search to find a setting, or pan down to peruse in the traditional way. But there's more, as Microsoft also included the option to pin any phone settings to Start.. Also, the agenda view in Calendar is back. After upgrading to Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2, users will be able to name their phone without connecting to a PC. Simply head to Settings / About / Edit name.. Another new feature included in the update is support for VPN. You will be able to use certificates to sign in for L2TP VPN connections. In addition, always-on VPN profiles are now supported too, so you’re automatically and always connected.. Some app privacy permissions have also been added, so users will now be able to control whether an app can access their contacts, calendar, camera, microphone and text messages In order to do that, you will need to go to Settings / App permissions.. Keep in mind that Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2 for Xolo WIN W1000 is pushed OTA (over the air) in stages, so it might take a few days until it reaches all devices.. # Xolo WIN Q1000 # Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2 # Windows 10 Mobile # Windows Insiders # Windows Phone update.

Xolo Win Q1000 Review — A Perfect Balance of Design, Build and Performance. Featured Review 2015-04-07. Game Performance with Asphalt 8 : Airborne. Xolo WIN Q1000 is the second Windows Phone from Xolo, and the company did really well designing a beautiful and light smartphone, following the legacy of Win Q900s. Selling at Rs 6,999 promotional offer (MRP Rs 8,500 Appx), this phone impressed us for its value for money, performing hardware, design, build and its look! I will be comparing it with Win Q900S at many places, for you to get an idea on how things have improved.. comes with an impressive 5 inch IPS LD 720P screen built using One Glass technology. In my day-to-day usage, I really loved amount of blackness of the screen, sharp text, and vibrant colours. The display has wide viewing angle which makes sure the. colours don’t change when you are tilt gaming, watching video, and when you have a lot of people together looking at the screen.. The swipe experience of the phone is great, and I would love to remark that it is as good as the Lumia 532 and 435 which we recently experienced. No lags, scrolls are fast and so on. You will notice that phone doesn’t get fingerprints, but it does collect dust even though Xolo claims it doesn’t.. This phone has improved a lot on this front. If you remember Q900s , it was thin, with lower build quality for many to think it may break. has a solid build quality, and fits really well in your hands. The buttons are responsive and have no complaints here.. When it comes to design, its one of the most beautiful phone around. The screen folds around the edges, giving you a feel of having a bezel less screen. The buttons are just around the edges, and mixes in the black part.. The top and bottom of the phone’s front has wide bezel which adds up really well with the black screen in between. The bezel is place holder for front camera, sensors, in-call speaker and microphone. These bezel come in white, black and green which is followed by the rear case.. The rear of the phone houses the 8 MP Camera which is powered by Pure Cel Sensor. The camera protrudes out a bit, with flash located right below. The speaker is right at the rear bottom.. The phone houses a 8 MP rear camera which can. take picture in 3264 × 2448, and record video in FWVGA (848 X 480). decent, and its good for day light photography and macros. However the Xolo claimed PureCel Sonsor technology isn’t something ground breaking. The camera has auto focus, tap to focus,. Take a look at the samples below:. More video sample in the video below. The front camera is ok for selfie mode, but don’t expect a lot.. 1 GB RAM and 8 GB internal storage. This is a very good combination to keep up the performance, make sure every app runs and you aren’t running out of space as soon as you setup your phone.. After using tons of apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, Twitter and other stock app,. I failed to find any hiccups or lags with them. They switch back and forth nicely. You can have 8 Apps running in background.. Two things I noted in particular. One that there is no Automatic Brightness control and second the WIFI Adapter isn’t very powerful. The connection does break when you are around corners.. In my earlier review of Windows Phone devices,. a lot of you asked me to check on the browser. Windows Phone 8.1 is loaded with IE browser and it performed decently. I explored sites like GSMArena, YouTube, Gaana.com and all media streamed well and without hiccups. The video playback was smooth as well.. Now, there is known thing about IE on Windows Phone that it does not render all website properly. If that is so, please use an alternate browser, like UC browser , till we get to see better rendering engine for IE which is expected in Windows 10. This phone is confirmed to get that update.. Playing game on 5 inch IPS LCD screen is a bliss, specially with added wide view angle. The colours are great, the graphics. best part of the gaming was. After 45 minutes of gameplay, the phone stayed cool which is something you will appreciate.. While there no major lags during gaming, I did feel game going bit slow, specially when driving the car, like its little out of control, but thats on a minimal level.. The phone is packed with 2200 mAh battery. When tested under various condition, it will live for a day easily. I had 28 hours of battery on regular usage and 16 hours on heavy usage. However, this will change depending on how much media you consuming, take picture, shoot video and so on.. The phone comes with 8 GB of internal storage,. 45 GB is taken by system update, and around 500 MB more for apps, when you first turn on your phone. This gives you 5 GB of storage to head start with , and is more than enough. The phone supports microSD of upto 32 GB. You can install & move apps, games on SD card as well, leaving you free to keep space on your primary storage. Like always, I will recommend you to use a class 10 SD card as it performs better when it comes to apps and games.. The phone has a 720P display, and the processor supports up to 1080P. I tested around with lot of HD files from many places i.e. The videos with 720P resolution, just play fine, The YouTube videos are played in HQ format which looks sharp.. video resolution which is around 720P or less works. However, there is a bit of restriction on the format, as not all of them are supported yet.. The other way round to solve this problem is using third part players. like MoliPlayer which were able to play the files smoothly. You will need to choose Software rendering instead of hardware to make it work.. When copying files to Windows Phone, directly, you get a notification about converting the format. If you follow that, it maintains the quality of the video, but lowers the resolution.. You wont be disappointed and instead want to lower down the volume for call. I tested with lot of music apps, local music playback etc. The audio is quite loud, the clarity is good and you will enjoy listening to music both in speaker and earphones.. when on speaker, I would recommend you keep the volume a little lower as there is a bit of. The phone doesnt come with any Equaliser or Dolby Surround settings to improve the experience any further.. The phone delivers beautiful design, performance,. build quality and a decent camera. If you are looking for a 5 inch Windows Phone which has a different design, impressive screen, thin in form factor and lasts for a day, this is a phone you can think of picking up.. While the Lumia experience will be missing, you still have access to all the apps except for the Camera apps and few photo editing tools from Microsoft.. The phone is priced at Rs 8500. which directly competes with Lumia 535, and I am sure the price is going to fall soon. Also make sure to check out HomeShop 18 offers where they are selling it at Rs 6.999.. Wpxbox's Verdict Design and Build - 9.5/10 Display - 9/10 Camera - 7/10 Performance - 9/10 Battery - 8/10 Music and Speakers - 8/10 Gaming - 8/10 Value for Money - 9/10. Another brilliant phone from XOLO for Windows Phone segment, sending out a right signal as OEM. We wish more OEM follow the league!.

Otherwise, that’s quite a nice upgrade for xolo… Although then they shouldn’t be restricted to less than HD video recording (like the Blu). It is an msm8212 sd200 processor.. that’s what I was thinking too. I have the Blu win HD version and the 200 works great… Especially for the price. Shoot! That is a mistake on my part. I had it confused with the Graphics processor speed.. The default camera app in the Win Q1000 doesn’t have zoom. But zooming can be achieved using third-party camera apps like OneShot.. my new phone shows no signal when switch to 3G and restart after that got 2 g signal but after sometime its repeating even after phone update. Might be signal problem in your area, no issues with 3G connectivity on my Win Q1000.. Will this phone, Win Q1000, get Windows 10 Mobile update when available?. Not sure if Xolo will do it, but Blu has said it would upgrade its WP devices to W10M when it RTMs. If it’s really the same as the Blu Win HD, guess there might be ways to do it even if Xolo doesn’t support it?. Almost all ok, but speaker phone wasn’t good, only marginally more powerful than than its earpiece level. Instant Net connectivity was also an issue. Net used to also not work on weak signal… Very embarrassing. Cam very good if configured properly.Gr8 if configured correctly…. Huawei’s MateBook X Pro offers 91%.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars Good phone, but let down by a mediocre camera and gaming experience as well as lack of accessories. I am using this phone for the past 2 months and so I am in the position to list its pros and cons. Beautiful HTC-esque design which is far better than any Lumia. Loads of features for a very low price of just 6k such as a quadcore Snapdragon 8212 processor, 8 MP rear cam with flash and ability to play full HD videos among others. WP 8.1 OS runs smoothly without any lag. Lava (the parent company of XOLO) provides regular updates for this handset, which is a relief considering the fact that generally non-Lumia WP handsets are ignored. Phone comes with a nice set of accessories for its price such as a tempered glass screen guard, a glass back cover and USB cable, none of which are provided by Microsoft for its Lumias. Good and clear call, audio and video quality with very minimal call interference and drops. Good quality earphones and awesome music listening experience. Phone does not overheat much unlike its Lagdroid counterparts. Long battery life which is the hallmark of any WP handset. It's an Indian product and I prefer to encourage our desi brands. Underwhelming gaming experience, games like Subway Surfers and even Solitaire lag. Rear camera may be 8 MP, but the quality of the pictures taken using the device is grainy and mocks at the 8 MP camera claim. Accessories for the phone are very difficult to get..

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time 32.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time 22.1 days (530 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G) 12.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G) 20.8 days (500 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h).

Xolo Win Q1000 With Windows Phone 8.1 Launched at Rs. NDTV Correspondent , 24 February 2015. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Xolo has launched a new Windows Phone-based smartphone dubbed the Xolo Win 1000, at Rs. The smartphone is not to be confused with Xolo Q1000 , which is based on Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. The Win Q1000 has been listed on the company site with price, however, availability details are yet to be known.. It is worth mentioning that most of the smartphone's specifications match those of the Q1000. However, in some areas the Win Q1000 has the upper-hand. The dual-SIM supporting Xolo Win Q1000 features a 5-inch HD (720x1280 pixels) resolution IPS display with OGS technology, and is powered by a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 processor clocked at 1.2GHz that's coupled with 1GB of RAM and an Adreno 302 GPU.. With the amount of RAM it sports, the Windows Phone 8.1 -based smartphone might also receive the recently introduced Windows 10 OS update when it arrives. The company however has mentioned nothing about the update yet. Listed on the company website, the Xolo Win Q1000 houses an 8-megapixel rear camera with PureCel sensor, f/2.0 aperture and LED flash and a 2-megapixel front-facing camera. Also, the handset's inbuilt 8GB storage can be expanded via microSD card (up to 32GB).. The connectivity features of the smartphone include Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi, WLAN, A-GPS, and USB. The Win Q1000 is backed by a 2200mAh battery capacity, which the company claims can deliver up to 12 hours of talk time and 500 hours of standby time on 3G connectivity.. Measuring 143x71.3x8.8 mm, the Xolo Win Q1000 comes with MS Office apps pre-installed and will be available in White, Black and Green colour variants. Xolo is not new to Windows Phone-based smartphones as it has previously launched Win Q900s with almost similar specifications..
