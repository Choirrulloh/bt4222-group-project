Oppo R9s Plus - user opinions and reviews. The only thing great is the vooc charger. Other than that the BATTERY sucks. Already sent for warranty, 2 weeks later it goes down 20% in 4hrs with just wifi on and not using it. SCREEN really dark compared to R9+ and even worse if to compare to R7+ .... My wife uses her phone as a wifi hotspot for her PC - works fine. But, the hotspot seems to turn off randomly when she doesn't have it connected. Is it a case of the background app being closed down as a battery saving precaution?. Great phone all round camera is awesome had a huawei mate 8 this beats it and $300 cheaper very impressed.

The Bad iPhone-like design has rough edges and can get uncomfortably hot while gaming.. The Bottom Line The midrange R9s Plus is a decent phone at best, but lacks the chops to go head-to-head with flagships devices.. Oppo's R9s Plus ( $399.00 at Amazon.com ) is a bigger version of the 5.5-inch R9s , and uses its larger size to pack in a much meatier battery and upgrades to its rear 16-megapixel camera. Specifically, it adds optical image stabilization (OIS). All that sounds great, but the larger build winds up just supersizing the smaller R9s ( $449.00 at Amazon.com ) ' weaknesses, including the rough chamfered edges that make the metal-clad phone uncomfortable to hold.. I very much wanted to like this phone, but the iPhone-inspired design (that's not as smooth and seamless as the iPhone ), and the phone's tendency to significantly heat up during gameplay were huge drawbacks for me. On the other hand, the quality 16-megapixel rear camera with OIS does help it stand out slightly amid the competition. Check out the sample shots below.. Oppo R9s Plus sample camera shots. Like the smaller R9s, battery life seems to be the phone's other strong suit. In our video test, where we loop video in airplane mode until the battery's last gasp, the Plus managed to last 15 hours and 40 minutes, which is pretty good, though not as fantastic as the 22-hour battery life of the cheaper Samsung Galaxy A7 .. The R9s Plus is quite expensive for a midrange phone -- it costs around $550, which converts to £450 and AU$730 -- and that's because you're partly paying for the higher-end aluminum body and for the Oppo name. At the end of the day, the OnePlus 3T dominates the R9s Plus in both performance and value -- it's the far smarter buy. And if the 3T isn't to your taste, there's always the Asus ZenFone 3 ( $294.99 at Amazon.com ) or Samsung Galaxy A7, both strong midrange contenders.. Notifications toggle, dual-SIM, Dash Charging. Laser/phase detection autofocus, OIS (4-axis), fingerprint doubles as shutter button. Converts to AU$590 (64GB), AU$652 (128GB). Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition....

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Mid-range phablet with plenty to like. Without a doubt the best handset that Oppo has ever made. It’s also a brilliant mid-range phone that simultaneously troubles Apple and Google’s flagship phones on value.. Design Bigger than it looks thanks to bezels 64GB of internal storage can be expanded to 256GB Dual Nano SIM option Home button fingerprint scanner is super-quick. Once upon a time, phablet versions of phones were simply larger than their regular-sized counterparts. Now, though, pick up an Android with a screen larger than 5.9”, and you’re in for a treat. The extra room in the chassis offers manufacturers the chance to bolster the screen resolution, increase the battery capacity, and improve the camera’s capability.. While much of what we said in our R9s review stands true here, Oppo has improved upon that brilliant performer in a few ways, ticking two of those boxes, though the company’s philosophy of ‘bigger equals better’ sometimes comes back to bite it. As you’ll see, though, for this is phablet that punches well above its weight in the mid-range price bracket.. The Oppo R9s Plus retails at AU$698 compared to the AU$599 for the R9s. For this additional AU$99, the result is a mid-range beauty that impresses with its feature set, and also demonstrating that the Chinese company knows how to make a handsome unit, despite a few niggles with the interface.. Mid-range it may be, Oppo clearly has its eye on the phablet everyone else wants to best: the Apple iPhone 7. And it has the bullet point stats to do it: Oppo’s R9s Plus is taller, wider and yet thinner and lighter than Apple’s largest offering to date.. At first glance the Oppo R9s Plus looks like it’s bursting out of its frame, thanks to the screen taking up 72% of the front of the unit. Crucially, it looks like it takes up more than that, even giving Samsung’s Galaxy S8 a run for its money.. Like its smaller sibling, the phone is quite slippery despite the extra 0.7mm depth and slight gradient from the middle of the frame to the screen. Again, Oppo includes a basic silicone case with the phone, and the company has already installed a screen protector in case it does tumble out of your hand and onto the bathroom floor.. A capacitive touch button sits dead centre under the screen, and it’s wedged almost at the very end of the bottom of the frame. This button is blazingly fast, like the regular R9s, and will both wake the phone up and send you to the last active app or open screen. However, getting your thumb on it one-handed can be tricky at first. Because of the dimensions of the phone, those with Trumpian digits may find it see-sawing out of their grip.. Oppo has aped the Samsung layout, with the back button sitting to the right of the home key, and the recents to the left. This gives that screen full, glorious use of the real estate on offer. The power key sits on the right-hand edge about a third of the way from the top, and the volume buttons directly opposite on the left-hand side. For the Donalds of this world it can be a bit of a stretch to swing your thumb from the home key up to the power or volume.. The dual SIM tray on the right allows for two nano-SIM cards, or one SIM card and a microSD card. Go for the latter option and you can bolster the R9s Plus’ 64GB onboard storage up to 256GB. Like the R9s, a speaker grille, a micro USB port and 3.5mm headphone jack are placed along the bottom edge of the frame.. Imperceptible antenna lines run horizontally across the rear of the R9s Plus, laid out in two sets of three. They’re very fine, and sit well outside of the perimeter of your palm. If there’s one thing we do wish the R9s Plus had, it’s NFC. Android Pay is a total no-go here.. Next Page Screen and interface.

Oppo R9s Plus - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 4 5 6 ». The only thing great is the vooc charger. Other than that the BATTERY sucks. Already sent for warranty, 2 weeks later it goes down 20% in 4hrs with just wifi on and not using it. SCREEN really dark compared to R9+ and even worse if to compare to R7+ which give crispy display even adjust the brightness to very low. WIFI just so pathetically week and POP-UP NOTIFICATION don't seems to work on lots of apps. My wife uses her phone as a wifi hotspot for her PC - works fine. But, the hotspot seems to turn off randomly when she doesn't have it connected. Is it a case of the background app being closed down as a battery saving precaution?. The hotspot on my Find 7 will only shut down automatically when the battery gets to 10%. Great phone all round camera is awesome had a huawei mate 8 this beats it and $300 cheaper very impressed. The specs here state that the phone has NFC, it doesn't. Battery life is great, but it is really ruthless with closing down background apps even when you've changed the settings so they're not "battery optimised" - to the point where it's really intrusive in day to day use of the phone. The wifi antenna is pretty pathetic, probably because as Oppo point out on their website, they've made it really, really narrow. I wouldn't buy another Oppo phone. I'm just hoping this gets an upgrade to Android 7 at some point, as I'm not sure how much of the power management stuff is Marshmallow being useless..

CNET también está disponible en español.. Oppo R9s Plus serves up a powerful camera in a midrange package. The larger 6-inch version of the Oppo R9s improves on the excellent camera by packing in optical image stabilization.. by February 21, 2017 11:30 PM PST. Oppo R9s Plus sticks to the same familiar design. Quick specs Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 653 processor 6GB RAM, 64GB onboard storage 6-inch full-HD display Dual-SIM with 4G connectivity 4,000mAh embedded battery. Meet the Oppo R9s Plus, a bigger 6-inch version of the excellent R9s that adds optical image stabilization (OIS) to its rear camera.. The technology helps to take sharper images for those with shaky hands and makes the great camera from the R9s even better. Selfie lovers will also adore having a front 16-megapixel shooter for higher resolution pictures.. Unlike more modern phones, the R9s Plus sticks to a micro-USB port instead of a Type-C USB connector.. If you found the R9s too small, then you should have no issue with the larger Plus. Like the midrange R9s, the Plus features an iPhone-inspired design, which is a common theme found on Oppo's other phones .. I'm none too big a fan of this design choice, but it does help sell phones in the company's home country of China, where the iPhone , seen as a status symbol for those who can afford it, is too expensive for most of the population.. That said, Oppo could have paid a bit more attention to the design of the phone. Like the R9s, the chamfered edges of the phone are a tad sharp, especially compared with the smooth, round edges of the iPhone 7 Plus ( $891.02 at Amazon.com ) .. All in all, the R9s Plus does impress with its aluminium build and midrange specs. It's one of the few phones to sport a massive 6GB of RAM, though I'm not sure how much this will help with performance. Check back soon for our full review.. The R9s Plus comes powered by Android and has its own features to stick out, such as a large 6-inch full-HD display.. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition....

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Mid-range phablet with plenty to like. Performance Outpaces Google Pixel XL Keen multitasker Battery Battery will last all day Terrific fast charging Verdict. The R9s is hardly a slouch, and the R9s Plus ups its stats. You get the same powerful Octa-core processor (a Snapdragon 625 running at 1.96GHz) and the same GPU (an Adreno 506 GPU). Remarkably, an extra 2GB of RAM has been squeezed in, pushing the total to 6GB.. Running the GeekBench 4 CPU test, the Oppo R9s Plus trounces its smaller sibling, and puts it within spitting distance of the Google Pixel XL. The PCMark benchmark results are unusually incongruent though, showing a score of 4953 compared to the 7001 on the R9s. Even at 4953, the R9s Plus only just misses out on scuppering the Google Pixel XL (4965) but waggles its fingers at the Samsung S7 Edge (4713).. Nonetheless, these are numbers you can be happy with, and in the real world you have a very snappy and sharp phone wedged in your pocket.. The larger phone affords a greater capacity 4,000mAh powerplant compared to the 3,010mAh battery in the R9s. For everyday browsing and messages, the phone’s overkill, and the 6-inch screen gives you a ton of room for editing photos and watching YouTube. Again, PCMark shows impressive results for the battery test, giving a very desirable 14 hours and 48 minutes of run time.. We ran a few taxing games – XCOM Enemy Unknown, and Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars – and were left impressed. We say it a lot, but that screen gives so much scope to really enjoy the action.. And, if you do sap the battery, plug it in for 30 minutes to get an extra 2 hours of run time thanks to Oppo's proprietary VOOC 'Flash Charge' technology.. The smaller Oppo R9s was already a fantastic mid-range phone in its own right, and now, the Oppo R9s Plus has come along to improve upon it in a number of ways.. It's got a larger battery, more screen real estate, and Oppo has even managed to squeeze in a further 2GB of RAM, bringing the total to 6GB –. which is an incredibly impressive amount for a phone to have at this price point.. The lack of NFC functionality is admittedly a bummer, and ColorOS is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. We also found that using this large phone with one hand can be troublesome.. Simply put, this is the best phone Oppo has made to date. If you're looking for a premium phone experience without spending a fortune, the Oppo R9s Plus is easy to recommend. Though we originally dubbed the regular R9s as the king of mid-range phones, the crown has now been stolen for that phone's big brother. Prev Page Camera and music.

The Oppo R9s Plus is the best phone Oppo has produced to date, and a really solid mid-range challenger to the premium phone crowd. Oppo R9s Plus: Design Oppo R9s Plus: Why you’d want one High quality camera: The Oppo R9s Plus is priced as a mid-range phone, but you could be forgiven for thinking that it’s a high-end model based simply on its camera quality. Oppo has made bold claims about its cameras on previous models, but that’s often ended up being more of an idle boast than a reality. It’s not so with the Oppo R9s Plus’ F/1.7 optically stabilised 16MP rear camera, which has excellent fast focus and colour reproduction. Like the physical design, the camera app itself is very reminiscent of iOS’ camera app, but that does mean it’s nicely simple. The 16MP front camera features Oppo’s take on a beauty mode, dubbed "Beautify", and like most modes of that type, it can be a little hit and miss as to whether it makes you look pretty, or overly smooth to a disturbing level. Sometimes that’s part of the fun. Oppo R9s Plus Sample Photos Good core specifications: The Snapdragon 653 SoC that runs the Oppo R9s Plus isn’t top of the line, but Oppo matches that with 6GB of memory, and the end result is a phone that’s a little snappier than most mid-range phones when it comes to baseline performance. Handset Geekbench 4 CPU Single Core (higher is better) Geekbench 4 CPU Multi Core (higher is better) Oppo R9s Plus 1466 4415 Apple iPhone SE 2449 4171 ZTE Axon 7 1721 4089 Apple iPhone 6s 2465 4052 Google Pixel XL 1629 4051 Samsung Galaxy A7 771 3998 Motorola Moto Z 1477 3853 HTC U Ultra 1648 3848 Sony Xperia XZ 1636 3604 Google Nexus 6P 1293 3594 Oppo R9s 843 3119 Handset 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited Result HTC U Ultra 29968 Apple iPhone SE 29276 Google Pixel XL 28458 Apple iPhone 6s 28171 Sony Xperia XZ 26279 Motorola Moto Z 25629 Google Nexus 6P 24703 ZTE Axon 7 23955 Oppo R9s Plus 17755 Oppo R9s 13691 Samsung Galaxy A7 13629 Dual sim capability: Buy the Oppo R9s Plus outright, and it’s a dual SIM model out of the box. This isn’t true for the contract version, as is commonly the case for dual SIM contract phones in Australia, but if you’re not using the second tray anyway it doubles as a microSD expansion slot. Good fingerprint reader: Again, like the iPhone 7, the Oppo R9s Plus features a solid fingerprint reader with a tiny feedback motor to give the impression that you’re pushing a button. It’s not quite as refined as the iPhone’s take on the concept, but it works well and quickly for unlocking the phone. As an added bonus, you can enrol individual fingers to launch different apps. Good switcher's phone: Oppo’s approach to Android is to entirely re-skin it with what it calls "ColorOS". Like the external design of the Oppo R9s Plus, it borrows heavily from Apple, in this case iOS. That makes the Oppo R9s Plus an appealing prospect if you’re switching away from iOS but don’t want to lose that essential look and feel of the way iOS operates. Very fast charging: Like most recent Oppo devices, the Oppo R9s Plus uses the company’s own VOOC fast charging. As long as you’ve got the charger nearby, even if you’re low on power you won’t have to wait long at all to have a fully charged phone. Oppo R9s Plus: Why you might not want one Battery life could be better: Oppo equips the Oppo R9s Plus with a 4,000mAh battery, which is quite hefty. As such, we were expecting big things from it, because most phones that tip the scales with that kind of power can typically beat out 10 hours or more sustained benchmark battery life. It’s the one area where the Oppo R9s Plus didn’t quite live up to that promise. Here’s how it compared against a range of high-battery-capacity phones: Handset Geekbench 3 Battery Test Duration Geekbench 3 Battery Score LG X Power 14:50:30 5714 Huawei Nova Plus 13:21:20 8013 Samsung Galaxy A7 12:40:30 7603 Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 11:55:00 7150 Huawei Mate 8 11:14:40 6659 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 11:11:20 6713 Samsung Galaxy S7 10:01:20 6013 Motorola Moto X Force 9:46:50 3914 Motorola Moto 4G Plus 9:44:10 3977 Motorola Moto G Play 9:36:00 3840 Samsung Galaxy Note 5 9:18:00 5580 Google Pixel XL 9:14:20 5543 Huawei Mate 9 9:00:30 5330 Huawei P9 8:26:30 4948 LG Stylus DAB+ 8:11:40 3278 ZTE Axon 7 7:56:20 4763 Oppo R9s Plus 6:14:20 3484 ColorOS is messy: While it broadly mimics the look and feel of iOS, there are sections of ColorOS that are oddly laid out, or just plain odd. As an example, when you open up the provided theme store app, it warns you that it needs to send and receive SMS messages in order to operate. Why does a theme store need to send SMS messages? Other apps have odd English translations, or visual touches seemingly at odds with the rest of ColorOS’ style. None of it is terrible, but it sometimes feels a little underpolished. Marshmallow rather than Nougat: The Oppo R9s Plus stands as Oppo’s current "flagship" phone, but it’s stuck on Android 6.0 ("Marshmallow") rather than the newer Android 7.0 ("Nougat") release. This means that features that would make maximum use of the 6 inch display, such as split pane multitasking aren’t open to you. You’re stuck waiting to see if Oppo will offer Android 7.0 to its customers, or going down the sometimes risky path of flashing an upgrade yourself. No NFC: If you’re a fan of contactless payment systems such as Android Pay , Oppo isn’t the brand for you. Like its predecessors, the Near Field Communication (NFC) components needed to make contactless payments feasible are nowhere to be found on the Oppo R9s Plus. Who is it best suited for? What are my alternatives? Where can I get it?

Quick Verdict Oppo’s refinement of its core design has finally borne some excellent results in the Oppo R9s Plus.. Strengths High quality camera Good core specifications Dual sim capability Good fingerprint reader Very fast charging. Could be better Battery life could be better ColorOS is messy Marshmallow rather than Nougat No NFC. Oppo has gone from strength to strength in the Australian phone market, largely off the back of a range of mostly mid-range phones that ape the style of Apple’s very popular iPhones at a fraction of the cost. The end results have generally been good phones, but rarely great phones. With the Oppo R9s Plus , that changes. It’s taken the core of the Oppo R9s and expanded it in ways that makes for a truly compelling phone at a great price point.. Buy the Oppo R9s Plus from Amazon AU. The R9s Plus represents a compelling budget-friendly alternative to Apple's pricey iPhones.. We’re still not sure how Oppo hasn’t been greeted with some stern words from Apple’s lawyers, because the Oppo R9s Plus continues the trend of phones that look mostly like iPhones. In the Oppo R9s Plus’ case it’s obviously the iPhone 7 Plus that it apes, albeit with just a few unique style touches. We reviewed the white and gold version of the Oppo R9s Plus, but there’s also a black model if white isn't your style. Either is quite the striking device, with our white model enveloped in a gold coloured rear highlighted with metallic banding at the top and bottom. These aren’t just visual design cues, but also extensions to the Wi-Fi antenna for greater data receptivity. Unlike the iPhone 7 , a headphone jack is still present, located next to the microUSB socket at the base. Measuring in at 163.6x80.8x7.4 mm, the Oppo R9s Plus is, like most phablet-style phones, quite a lot to hold in the hand, although its bezel is relatively slim unlike some other larger phones. At 185 grams it has some heft in the hand, and the solid metal body gives it a premium feel that belies its asking price.. It’s not quite the same story for graphics performance, where the Oppo R9s Plus is somewhat outclassed by most of the same phones:. Overall, while benchmarks don’t tell the full story, they give a good reckoning of the Oppo R9s Plus’ overall power strategy. It’s not a premium phone, but it’s a powerful contender in the mid-range space.. Geekbench 3’s battery test provides a steady workflow to run the battery down, but it doesn’t always tell the whole story. In more anecdotal testing we could run through a full day’s reasonable use without too much trouble, although we’d never be able to hit two days as you can with some phones. Oppo’s power management is quite aggressive, and that can eke you out a little more power again. That being said, for a phone with a 4,000mAh battery, we expected more than the Oppo R9s Plus delivered.. Oppo’s refinement of its core design has finally borne some excellent results in the Oppo R9s Plus, and as a mid-range prospect it’s a phone we’d recommend to just about anybody, especially given how heavily its camera pushes above its pricing weight. It’s a step above the similar looking but smaller Oppo R9s, but that’s a phone that you should also consider if you’re switching away from an iPhone due to the same similarity issues with Apple’s iconic design. The mid-range space is one where we’re seeing a lot of activity and some truly exceptional phones, including the ZTE Axon 7 and Samsung’s Galaxy A7 ..

What’s new about the Oppo R9s Plus? 16MP F1.7 rear camera with Dual PDAF, Vooc Flash Charge, Solid state fingerprint reader How much will the Oppo R9s Plus cost? Outright at $698 or on contract.. The Oppo R9s Plus is Oppo’s latest phone to hit the Australian market after the Oppo R9s , and as the name suggests, it’s the bigger brother to Oppo’s stylish Android handset.. Oppo sells its phones pitched strongly at a mid-range market segment that wants a good looking phone with reasonable power but isn’t keen on either picking up a budget cheapie or for that matter a premium-priced device. While the strong focus for much of Oppo’s history has been on phones available for outright purchase, the Oppo R9s Plus can also be acquired on contract terms.. Like much of Oppo’s output, the Oppo R9s Plus has a strong resemblance to Apple’s iPhone lines, with rounded corners, a solid front-mounted home button that also doubles as a fingerprint sensor and Oppo’s own "ColorOS" overlay that fairly closely mimics Apple’s iOS. Being an Android 6.0 ("Marshmallow") phone, you could add any launcher you like to it, but it’s designed to work best within the ColorOS environment.. Oppo equips the Oppo R9s Plus with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 653 SoC and 6GB of RAM, which is an interesting mix of a mid-range processor with quite a lot of RAM. That should give it an edge in the competitive mid-range space, where we’ve seen a lot of gradual improvement over the years. Don’t expect the Oppo R9s Plus to hold its own against, say, an iPhone 7 Plus or the Galaxy S8+ , but then again, don’t expect to pay as much either.. Oppo is well aware of the benefits of having a good camera in a smartphone as a sales tactic, going so far as to use its Mobile World Congress 2017 launch simply to announce a new 5x Optical Zoom feature. That will be found in upcoming phones, but the Oppo R9s Plus should be no slouch in camera terms with a primary 16MP f/1.7 camera with inbuilt optical image stabilisation. On the front sits a 16MP f/2.0 camera. Oppo includes its "Beautify" software on the phone for softening selfie images if that’s important to you. We’re yet to put the Oppo R9s Plus through its photographic paces, but if Oppo’s hype is any indication it could be something special, particularly at this price point.. The Oppo R9s Plus uses a standard micro USB charger; while we’re seeing more and more phones opt for the newer USB C standard, Oppo is yet to go down this particular path. What it does offer is its own proprietary fast charging solution, called VOOC Flash Charge. This uses a specific high-capacity charger that Oppo says can power up the Oppo R9s Plus’ battery very quickly. You can still use a regular charger with the Oppo R9s Plus, but it will charge much more slowly if you do.. Oppo doesn’t list the Oppo R9s Plus as being specifically water resistant, so full immersion in water is not advised. It is fitted with Corning Gorilla Glass 5, which should protect it from drops and bumps, but that’s a different matter to it getting wet.. The Oppo R9s Plus is available in Australia now for outright purchase or on contract.. The Oppo R9s Plus sells in Australia at a recommended price of $698 at JB Hi-Fi, Officeworks and Woolworths.. It is also offered on contract through Woolworths Mobile if you’re happy to go on a 24 month contract:. Was this content helpful to you?. Oppo R9s: Compare the best plans and prices.

​Oppo R9s Plus phone: Full, in-depth review. ​Oppo R9s Plus phone: Full, in-depth review. Fast, great battery and great value - Oppo’s new Android smartphone is the best all-round flagship phone on the market. 628 Users want this. 4.75 / 5. This is Oppo’s best-ever phone and arguably the best-all round flagship on the market. Oppo has finally arrived at the big-boys table.. Key specs Oppo R9s Plus review Design and handling Both variants of the Oppo R9s Plus look very attractive. Read more: ​HTC U Ultra phone full, in-depth review. Update: Before you choose a phone, check out the amazing Samsung Galaxy S8 review .. A few years ago it was Huawei which burst on to the mobile phone scene with its Mate 7 and offered one of the best phones on the market for much less money than its big-brand rivals. Today, Huawei is still a bit cheaper than the traditional big-name rivals it now sits at the same table with, but its amazing flagship Mate 9 phone isn’t quite so disruptive in terms of price. 6in, 1080 x 1920 LCD screen, 64/6GB RAM, Quad-core Snapdragon 1.95GHz 653 CPU, Adreno 510 GPU, 16MP rear and 16MP front cameras, microSD/dual SIM slot, microUSB, Android 6, 4,000mAh battery, 164 x 81 x 7mm, 185g. Oppo’s R9 was a middling phone for a middling price. The more recent R9s , however, was one of the best-looking phones we’d ever seen. It could feel a bit slow and had foibles like poor shutter lag, but was still a great value buy. Now we have the R9s Plus which is the oversized, supercharged version of the supercharged version. And it looks like many of the foibles have gone.. We received the white-and-gold variant which looks very good (and very similar to an iPhone). There’s also a jet black variant which, if it’s anything like the R9s we reviewed, will be a great-looking Yin to this Yan. Oppo bundles in a great, silicon case which doesn’t just offer better protection and grip but lets you see the phone's chassis beneath. It doesn’t make the (already-large) phone feel too bulky.. While competitors have been edging away from a full 6-inch screen, Oppo has gone the whole hog and embraced it. Yet the device feels the same size as other recent flagships: HTC’s U Ultra , Huawei’s Mate 9 and the Google Pixel XL. The screen is a straight, Full HD LCD affair. Some may miss the Ultra-high definition, colour-popping AMOLED screens seen on competitors but for general use and photography we had no complaints – especially as this type of screen tends to boost battery life.. The first thing you notice is the speed of the (beneath-the-screen-mounted) fingerprint reader which, like the R9s, feels impossibly fast.. The Operating System is Oppo’s Color OS 3 which sits atop Android 6 – it makes its presence felt far more significantly than other launcher environments. While some may roll their eyes at the older version of Android, Color OS adds some attractive features.. It runs regular performance tune-ups to flush the memory and keep things ticking along nicely. There's also a file-locking feature which usefully allows you to secure important work files, apps and nudie pics so that you can confidently pass your phone to friends/family/kids knowing that they won’t see things they shouldn’t.. There are multiple gestures that you can use to enhance phone calls, take screenshots and lock the screen with (if you choose – many are off by default). There are some useful tricks here if you care to put in the time and some, like enhanced screenshot which lets you scroll down a chat list or long web-page, are unique and potentially very useful. The built-in instruction manual is well-laid out and interesting to browse. O-Cloud lets you backup Contacts (meh) and SMS messages (potentially very useful). Night-mode (screen-colour warming to prevent eye strain in the dark) is a prominent feature but you have to enable/disable it manually.. It’s worth remembering that many of these features can be added as third-party apps to other Android phones, but here they’re all integrated and less likely to interfere with each other.. One of the noticeable improvements over the smaller Oppo phones is performance. While the Snapdragon 653 chipset isn’t Qualcomm’s fastest, it is latest-generation and more power-efficient than it’s ‘superior’ siblings. Combined with a massive 6GB of RAM, we actually struggled to detect much lag at all. Everything launches essentially-instantly including the camera. As we’ll see below, the combination of the chipset and Color OS means that battery life has been enhanced and the camera’s shutter lag has gone.. In terms of audio, the microphone is very good at capturing crisp and clear sound. The speakers get loud and offer some impressive punch both with treble and bass (for a phone). It makes a decent conference call unit.. All in all this feels like one of the fastest phones around and we’re impressed.. Oppo includes a massive 4,000mAh battery which, along with the Huawei Mate 9, is one of the largest on the market. However, for various reasons including a power-hungry camera and faster processor, Huawei’s battery still doesn’t last much more than a day without charging. Meanwhile the R9s Plus very nearly lasted for two days under heavy usage. With Oppo’s Color OS power management, we wouldn’t be surprised if it more-easily did last for two full days as time goes on.. During testing we took many photographs, did a great deal of web browsing and social media and also some navigation. While we have seen better performance from some older phones, this is the best from a current-flagship model. It means that if you need a top phone for work this should be high up your list..

3.9 from 15 reviews. Your trust is our top concern. Companies can't alter or remove reviews from ProductReview.com.au.. 5 out of 5 ,. Bought outright and put it on a $29 per month plan which worked out much better than getting a plan with phone included. Replaced Samsung Galaxy Note 5, which had developed terrible battery life, not even lasting a day. The battery on the Oppo lasts all day with heavy use, and 2 days with light use. Camera quality good, love the screen size, price great. Many people mistake it for the iphone.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. I transitioned into the oppo r9s plus from an iPhone, and I've never made a better a decision. The design of the phone is similar to an android build while the OS is a less polished version of iOS. Despite this, the functionality is great, while also being able to customise almost every aspect to suit yourself. This phone will last me years and for it's price, it's a steal.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. A better alternative than iPhone 7 or 8 plus, given the lower price! Comes with screen protector and plastic cover so a huge plus! Screen is larger than iPhone 7 Plus so a huge positive to me to use it as phablet. Camera has OPPO software which beautify the photo automatically. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. A little bit heavy than other smartphones, but gets the job done. 4 out of 5 ,. Purchased this with a good deal, the screen is huge. However using it for a while i realised it is a little bit heavy, so if you don't have damage your wrist, should probably consider the little brother of this phone. This phone has a micro SD card slot, so you can have more storage too. Overall, a good phone, for me its a bit heavy.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 1 out of 5 ,. On paper, the R9s Plus is a powerhorse. The operating system is crippled by Oppo's alterations to Android. They've tried to make it aesthetically similar to iPhones, and in doing so taken away everything good about Android. I've never experienced a phone with more crippled software. They've screwed up the most simple things. The default SMS app is absolutely useless and featureless. You can't even view the time each msg was received. Oppo has disabled the ability to select your own SMS app in the name of "security", and they've done some other weird things for "security" as well. Oppo's in-built security and app management force closes apps and also makes it very hard to manage app permissions. Part of the fun of android is the ability to customise it, and Oppo have done their darndest to make sure that you can't. You can't install a custom operating system. Which would be okay, if Oppo ever sent software updates; they don't. Notifications don't work most of the time. Sometimes they don't appear in the notification bar, and 95% of the time they don't make noise / appear on the lock screen either. I'm sorry this review is so long, but I have very strong feelings about Oppo. This phone was the worst I've ever bought.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. I've had an iPhone and a Samsung Galaxy. I bought the phone June or July last year. Love the memory, can have dual sim or a sim and memory card, but has heaps of memory anyway. Straight out of the box, it's already got a screen protector and a gel case. Camera is pixel and not optimal, so keep that in mind. I always change my photo setting to the best quality. The phone is also not waterproof, so do your best not to drop it in the toilet.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. The phone is a little heavy it works well we'd. It's easy to use the only negative is it does not have NFC so it's a little useless I todays market just a few years behind the rest phone is quite fast but slow when playing games. Takes OK photos could be a bit better for 16 mpxl. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 3 out of 5 ,. For the price of this phone you get some amazing specs, a massive battery, strong glass front. 6gb of RAM!! this beauty has great potential. what they don't tell you at purchase is how terrible the software is! it's compatability to the 6th operating system of android results in a lot of notification errors, unable to notify me correctly with a great deal of apps causing a lot of gaming issues, missed phone calls and simple events. I've also found the device to have a great deal of trouble distinguishing when I want to turn the volume down and whether I want to change the volume of the ringer, game sounds or my chromecast TV, forcing me to go into the settings app to adjust the desired volume level. the alarm has no function outside of a 24 hour period, you cannot set a work alarm for monday on friday. The worst part I think is the priority the phone sets for functions. despite it's massive 6gb of RAM it likes to constantly run approximately 4gb of processors in the background, more RAM than most phones have at all. Yet despite it's RAM usage it cannot get even the simplest of functions correct. The lowest I could get this usage to was 3.6gb after disabling and deleting it's bluetooth functions, something I never have turned on anyway still needed to be deleted. When the phone reaches 10% instead of sacrificing the background processors it seems to shut down half of the graphics processors to save on battery. It would not have to do this if it weren't so insistant on running unused functions at all times. I think this would not irk me so much if it was able to give me notifications correctly. it's not an ideal phone for gamers or for general daily use. it has the appeal of a good price but not had the extensive work put into it such as an iphone or samsung. If you ask me Android is way over its head trying to fit into every device. get an operating system designed for a phone and you won't ever have problems. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. Bigger is better, great phone for the price. 5 out of 5 ,. For those of you wanting a phablet (bigger phone), great performance and amazing battery life, you really can't go wrong with an Oppo R9s Plus. it has a nice big (6") display (great for watching movies!) and is easy to read things on the screen. It has a slim and ergonomic design, so i find it actually doesn't feel as big in the hand and is actually quite pocketable too. i'm finding the battery life is great (think at least 2-3 days with basic usage), and then with its proprietary fast charging, i can top it up quick smart (for eg. 30mins and i'll have more than 50% charge!). most of us are time poor(er), so the less time spent glued to the wall, the better!. I'm not really into cameras/selfies, but for what i've used it for im more than happy with the quality (both day and night shots). Friends who have used the selfie camera always comment on how clear the pictures are, so i guess that it is good. the fingerprint scanner is pretty awesome too. Other small things i appreciated, it has a screen protector pre-applied (no more air bubbles!) and a protective case comes in the box - so pretty much everything i needed from day one. if you're into other types of cases, its a bit harder to find things in store, so online/ebay may be your best friend!. The interface seems a crossbreed of iOS and Android, but its nice and simple and can be customised, so i guess it will work for most people (it does for me anyway - i'm pretty basic). one function i find that i use alot, is a "V" to activate the flashlight. so useful, especially with the days getting dark earlier. Overall, for myself, i find it a great device and i feel that for what i paid, i couldnt be happier, and can definitely recommend this to others.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. Great phone, big 6" screen & loooong battery life.. 5 out of 5 ,. I bought this phone for 2 reasons really (screen size & battery life), but it came with 2 bonuses. I think the 6" screen is fantastic, especially when I've got Google Maps running. The other main reason for purchasing it was the long battery life - it's really good but I drain the battery completely once a week and sometimes it seems like its never gonna die! The VOOC car charger was an awesome add-on to buy ($40 from ebay - delivered). Bonus 1: it's a really nice champagne (light gold) colour so I'm quite happy with a clear case. Bonus 2: I was able to redeem most of my flybuys points/dollars for JB HiFi gift cards ($400 worth) and was able to use the lot towards purchasing the phone outright (normally just under $700 aussie dollars). Anyway, absolutely enjoying this phone and highly recommend it. Ebay have a good variety in cases and screen protectors available for this phone and cost very little! P.S. it also comes with a screen protector and clear case included in the box, but I purchased a "shockproof" case from ebay for $16.99.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. The Oppo R9s plus is the best phone I have brought and used. I haven't had any issues with it and it functions great and the operating system is fast and efficient not to mention the amazing front and rear camera quality is amazing with great settings to capture the perfect picture. I recommend this phone to everyone looking for a new phone.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. Amazing phone that charges super fast and the battery last for a very long time. OS is very good and fast, better then IOS in a lot of ways, I have been using this phone for 12 months now, never had any problem. My wife bought one as well, its that good. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 2 out of 5 ,. The phone is a great size with a wonderful camera but the operating system (Color OS v3.0.0.1i) it uses is horrible. I barely get any notifications and you are unable to use anything other than the standard message application. I have to restart my phone at least once a day so my fitbit application opens. Sporadic Gumtree, ebay and calendar notifications. The battery is amazing but the operating system really let's it down.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. Great quality phone let down by very poor firmware and zero support. 2 out of 5 ,. Did a lot of reading about these phones when I was in the market for a new phone. Went into the store and had a look at it and was instantly sold on the quality. But that is where it stopped. The issues started with the moment I took it out of the box. Did not matter what settings were used or what SIM card, no MMS. Next I found that teathering would not work. Again, no amount of settings edited would change it. Next was apps blocked from sending notifications. No amount of tweaking the notification settings would help. Then it was onto SMS notifications. Some days yes, no issues, other days, it would sit next to me at work and I would get nothing. Next was the issue of setting not sticking. Some would last until next reboot, some would last until the phone went to sleep. I really wanted to like this phone. It was quick, felt nice in the hand and had a beautiful screen, but the ColorOS overlay was just fraught with bugs and errors. I am sure that if they ever release "project spectrum" or allow access to this phone to install AOSP Android and roms, it would make an amazing phone. Ended up returning my phone for a full refund. Some things I could live with, but I can't have a phone I can't trust to randomly not give me messages.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 6 inch screen + 6gb ram = perfect for me.. 4 out of 5 ,. This is a pretty cool phone for the price. Big screen, big on power, massive battery capacity, fast charging & best of all its an Android. The only complaint I have is the speakers aren't great, though ok when running through the car or home sound system.. Similar opinion?

OPPO R9s Plus Review – The OPPO R9s has the sleekest looks among other OPPO devices, especially the Black model (make sure to check our review on the OPPO R9s ). It has an outstanding value for a mid-range phone, but performance. is not one of its strongest traits.. OPPO R9s Plus is now here, bigger (literally) and more powerful than the R9s. So if you are craving for a faster phone with the biggest display for content consumption available from OPPO, this is it.. It is available for purchase now in Gold and Black models for around A$698 RRP at Australian retailers like JB Hi-Fi, Officeworks, and Woolworths.. As usual, the nice, translucent case comes for free with the packaging and the phone has also a screen protector applied on it.. The R9s Plus device itself is as sleek as the R9s and again, I quite love the Black model and OPPO should make it available in all future models. At a glance, the OPPO R9s Plus looks very similar to the R9s at all angles and also features-wise, except for these few differences.. The camera, unfortunately, does not get an upgrade on the R9s Plus model so it still has the same lens and qualities as the R9s. In a nutshell, your photo quality will not improve if you upgrade from an R9s to an R9s Plus.. However, it definitely gets a big upgrade in terms of specs – especially its faster processor and the huge jump of RAM (6GB on an Android phone is huge!). I can definitely feel the difference when I start using the R9s Plus (from. Things are snappier and apps open quicker. The fingerprint sensor seems to have the same speed in unlocking the device, but I could be wrong. But there is definitely a jump in performance in day to day operations.. To those who like benchmarking stats, here are AnTuTu and Geekbench 4 benchmark results:. As comparison, the OPPO R9s only gets 65,357 (AnTuTu) and 838 (Single-Core)/3117 (Multi-Core) on Geekbench 4.. For photography, the F1.7 Aperture lens manage to capture even the hardest scenes with less noise, but there are lots of details missing from the scene. For a mid range phone, these are pretty forgiving, but you shouldn’t rely on it for extreme low-light photography:. Outdoor pictures and scenes with rather-low lights are not bad. for a phone of this price point:. The rest of the phone’s features are pretty similar to the OPPO R9s so you may want to read my R9s review article as well. The bigger size has its drawbacks though (for me personally), as I find it a harder. to use with one hand and also to type/chat.. ColorOS also still has its quirks, especially in the notifications area, and having to manually whitelist apps is definitely not user friendly at all (this is probably due to ColorOS closing apps too generously to save battery). If there is an easy way to just get rid of ColorOS and use a stock Android, I’d definitely prefer that.. For daily use, the OPPO R9s Plus is great for content consumption, like watching YouTube videos and for social media. It unlocks really, really fast (even faster than the iPhone 7 Plus ) and has the snappiest performance compared to the older generations of OPPO phones like the R9s or the R9 Plus ..

Notice: Phone scammers are posing as WhistleOut. 64GB of storage out of the box. OPPO's take on Android has its share of quirks. Verdict: If you're comfortable with the honking huge 6-inch display, the R9s Plus is excellent value and. As the name suggests, the 6-inch OPPO R9s Plus is a bigger version of the 5.5-inch OPPO R9s , released at the start of this year. While larger companion devices are typically quite similar to their smaller sibling, the R9s Plus makes a few more changes than you'd expect.. In addition to the larger screen, slightly higher price tag, and bigger battery, the R9s Plus has a slightly faster processor and a whopping 6GB of RAM - 2GB more than the R9s - which seems to have resulted in performance improvements across the board.. And as with OPPO's other devices, the R9s Plus feels like more phone than the $698 price-tag would lead you to believe.. The R9s Plus looks a lot like an iPhone. The design is derivative, but at least it's a nice design. The R9s Plus has some flavour of its own thanks to a pill-shaped home button flanked by two capacitive buttons on either side and a unique approach to antenna bands. Rather than using two plastic strips (as found on most aluminium smartphones), the R9s Plus has six tiny bands. Importantly, there's still a headphone jack.. OPPO have paired the premium aesthetic with a premium feel; aluminium bodies might be getting a bit tired these days, but the R9s Plus is an undeniably nice phone. There's only two smalls things I can ding it for in terms of feel. Firstly, you can tell that the glass and metal are two distinct elements on the R9s Plus (as you can on the R9s), whereas the join feel a little more seamless on the latest iPhones. This doesn't make the phone uncomfortable to hold, it's more something you might notice when picking it up. Secondly, the capacitive home button's haptic feedback is kinda weak, but that's more me nit-picking. The fingerprint reader is superfast though.. Despite the honking huge screen, the R9s Plus doesn't feel excessively large. Sure, it's big, but it's very similar in size to the Huawei Mate 9 and the HTC U Ultra, despite boasting a bigger display. Most people will struggle to use the R9s Plus one-handed, but that's to be expected with a phone of this stature. The only thing I've comfortably been able to do with one hand is scroll.. Speaking of the screen, it's bright, rich, and vibrant. The 1080p resolution is a little low for a 6-inch display, but at the same time, you shouldn't notice too much of a drop in quality compared to Quad HD. unless you're smooshing the screen against your face. The R9s Plus also handle outdoors a little better than its smaller sibling, and is easy to use in all but the brightest of sun.. While the R9s Plus packs a midrange processor, it certainly doesn't feel midrange when it comes to day to day performance; I didn't find anything that made it buckle. Battery life is great too, and depending on how hard you push it, the R9s Plus will easily last between a day and a half and two full days.. The slight processor improvement and the additional 2GB of RAM also seem to help the R9s Plus when it comes to photography. The camera opens faster and shoots faster than the one on the smaller R9s, which already did a pretty good job for a phone in its price range. The changes mostly make it easier to take a good photo in lowlight, with resulting images turning out clearer and sharper. Fast motion can still trick up the R9s Plus, but for the most part, I was able to get most of my lowlight photos in one snap.. As with the R9s Plus' smaller sibling, software is the only real issue with OPPO's supersized smartphone. OPPO's take on Android - ColorOS 3.0 - is seemingly design to mimic Apple's iOS and feels more like imitation rather than flattery. Fortunately, you can always cut back on some of the visual idiosyncrasies (and get more of a stock Android feel) by installing apps such as Google's Pixel Launcher, Gboard, ExDialer, and Messages.. That being said, I did initially have a few issues swapping away from OPPO's default apps, where the device would repeatedly ask for permissions every time I wanted to send a text message or make a phone call. A recent software update does seem to have addressed this though.. While you can change the feel of the R9s Plus' operating system, you can't get rid of all of the quirks. The worst of all is a split notifications and quick actions interface. When you swipe down from the top of the screen, quick actions and notifications appear across two different panes, and oddly, quick actions appear first, so you'll need to swipe left to see your notifications. It's not the end of the world, but at least personally, I check my notifications far more than I need access to quick actions like toggling Wi-Fi or changing screen brightness.. There's also a few other small issues you'll have to deal with, like the operating system asking you if you'd like to let your apps actually use mobile data, and random notifications asking you to shut down apps for battery optimisation reasons.. The R9s Plus doesn't have water-resistance, which isn't surprising given the price-point, but the lack of NFC is a bit odd. While it won't be a huge deal for everyone, it does mean you can't use the R9s Plus for contactless payment solutions like Android Pay.. There's also no oleophobic coating on the screen, which makes fingerprints and smudges a bit more noticeable.. The R9s Plus is quite possibly OPPO's best phone yet, and veritable bargain at just $698. There's a few bugbears, but in terms of value, it goes toe-to-toe with - if not surpasses - the big guys. Of course, the 6-inch display is sure to be divisive; the R9s Plus is one big phone. While this has its downsides - and personally, I'd be happier with a smaller device - it also results in a hearty. battery life, and gives you a great screen for watching video on the go.. You'll make a couple of small sacrifices in the pursuit of savings - namely, coming to terms with ColorOS' quirks, the lack of NFC, no water-resistance or oleophobic coating on the screen - but provided you're happy to deal with the size, you're giving up very little and saving more than a few dollarydoos with the OPPO R9s Plus.. If the R9s Plus' larger form-factor isn’t for you, but you're still interested in a bang for buck device, the regular R9s could be right up your alley.. Huawei's Mate 9 is a similarly large device, rocking a 5.9-inch screen and an equally impressive battery. The biggest benefit from dropping a bit more dosh on the Mate 9 is the dual rear-camera system co-engineered with Leica that can take some very pretty photos.. The Pixel XL is almost twice the cost of the R9s Plus, but it's a hell of a phone. Since the hardware and software come direct from Google, you'll be among the first to get new updates for Android, and you'll also avoid any of the quirks that come with third party customisations like ColorOS..
