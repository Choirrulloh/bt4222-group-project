CNET también está disponible en español.. Oppo decides to go big or go home with the 6-inch R7 Plus. The Good The Oppo R7 Plus is very well built and has a battery life that borders on the jaw-dropping.. The Bad Oppo's cluttered version of Android leaves a little to be desired and the phone's sheer size will put off a few people.. The Bottom Line The Oppo R7 Plus is the best combination of mid-range specs we've seen on a phone at this price for some time.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Design and build 6-inch screen, 1080p AMOLED screen 158 by 82.3 by 7.75mm (6.22 by 3.23 by 0.31 inches) 192 grams (6.77 ounces) A handsome brushed metal rear adds some refinement to the R7 Plus. Unlike the R7, the R7 Plus has no button (physical or touch sensitive) on the front of the phone. Hardware Qualcomm 1.5GHz Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor 3GB of RAM 32GB of storage microSD card slot 4,100mAh battery The 13-megapixel camera sits above the fingerprint scanner. Software and apps Android 5.1.1 ColorOS 2.1 Fingerprint app access. With the R7 Plus, Oppo is going big. The super-sized phone sports Oppo's biggest screen to date, with a 6-inch AMOLED display packed into the frame. Ostensibly a larger version of the Oppo R7 , the Plus adds a few other features, such as an enormously long-life battery, to create a well-rounded mid-range device that offers a lower priced option for anyone hunting for a big-screen experience.. For a little while now, Chinese-based manufacturer Oppo has been making a big push into new markets such as the US and Australia. In fact, in Australia, Oppo has secured a deal that sees it retail exclusively in the extensive network of Dick Smith electronics stores, as well as recently signing its first telecommunications carrier deal with Optus.. All this has equated to some surprisingly low pricing on the R7 Plus, at least in Australia. It's AU$599 over here, with the US pricing at $499 and Europe at €429, all unlocked. (In Singapore it's S$699, which doesn't quite make it the same value. You can find it online in the UK for around £315.). Oppo's 6-inch R7 Plus offers big screen features at a small price (pictures). My colleague Aloysius Low called the 5-inch Oppo R7 "a beautiful phone" and I wouldn't hesitate to describe the R7 Plus in the same way. The metal body adds a real sense of quality to a build that belies the moderate price.. The matte metal finish on the back is quite stylish and, as always, a very nice change from high-gloss fingerprint magnets. Speaking of fingerprints, the scanner on the rear is perfectly placed to unlock the phone with a single hand (for me anyway) and, in a very smart move, simply touching the scanner even when the screen is off will unlock the phone and wake up the display.. I am unashamedly a fan of big-screen phones. These days even a 5-inch screen feels undersized to me. That said, the R7 Plus is massive by anyone's standard, adding an extra half-inch of screen to the so-called "phablets" like the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and even the new Sony Xperia Z5 Premium. It's roughly the same weight and length as the 5.5-inch Apple iPhone 6S Plus, but it's nearly 5mm wider. People with hands that veer into the 'petite' side of the equation may find it just too wide.. The screen is bright and clear, but resolution junkies might find the 1,920x1,080 pixels to be a step down from the "Quad HD" 2,560x1,440-pixel resolution, which you see on phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S6. For my money, the screen seemed just fine both in regular use and when gaming and watching videos. There may not be the wow factor of the ultra-crisp Xperia Z5 Premium with its 3,840x2,160-pixel display, but neither is there the significant price tag.. The screen was mostly fine to use outside. I say "mostly," because viewed front-on it's quite easy to read, even in bright light. But a combination of sunlight and an odd angle can be a problem. I only noticed this when trying to take a macro shot of a flower without kneeling down, so it's unlikely to be a scenario that comes up too often.. The display curves down at the edges making for a nice rounded finish on the front of the R7 Plus. The design eschews any physical or touch-sensitive buttons, with just a power button on the right side of the phone and the volume on the left, in addition to the rear fingerprint sensor.. Just in case I haven't been clear, this is a big phone. It's not something that's easy to slip into your jeans and if you think that a 5.5-inch phone like the iPhone 6S Plus is too big then this is going to feel like you're carrying a flatscreen TV. But it's well designed, the brushed metal rear means it doesn't feel slippery when held in one hand and the fingerprint scanner is even well placed for single-handed operation.. The R7 Plus has the same chipset as the 5-inch R7: a Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor along with 3GB of RAM. It's a solid bit of hardware to power a mid-range device, but it's not top of the line.. Storage-wise there's 32GB on board and you can add up to 128GB via microSD slot. However, the model I used was a dual-SIM device and inserting a microSD card will take up one of the SIM slots, so you can't add storage and a second SIM.. It also has the same 13-megapixel rear camera and 8-megapixel front camera as its smaller brethren, but the Plus features a dual LED flash and a laser auto focus.. It's a Category 4 LTE device, which means it has a theoretical top download speed of 150Mbps. This is actually is a little disappointing with Category 6 (300Mbps) slowly becoming the norm and, in Australia at least, even some Cat 11 (600Mbps) devices hitting the streets. But in truth, it's still more than fast enough for regular use.. The massive 4,100mAh battery also has Oppo's fast-charging technology, with 5 minutes getting you enough juice for a 2-hour phone call, according to the company. In testing though, I found the battery so good I didn't particularly worry about fast charging -- but more on that later.. I've never been a fan of phone manufacturers using their own proprietary skins and overlays on Android. It's a personal preference, but I prefer a cleaner Android experience. You certainly don't get that with the R7 Plus or, indeed, any Oppo phone. Oppo has its own skin called ColorOS, which is currently at version 2.1.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition....

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. posted by Luis D.. 1 Introduction, Design and Display. 2 Interface, Performance and Connectivity. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction Oppo's R7 series of smartphones is the Chinese manufacturer's strategic force for conquering the mid-range category, where devices aim to offer quality design and satisfactory performance at a more affordable price point compared to brand-name flagship smartphones. The Oppo R7 Plus is most certainly an example of this trend in motion with its large display, metal construction and modern-day hardware powering it. But does it have what it takes to justify its, admittedly, considerable price tag of $500 unlocked? We'll have a try at answering that by putting the phablet through its paces! Package includes: Oppo R7 Plus SIM ejector tool Information guides Clear silicone protection case Earbuds Charging and data microUSB cable VOOC Charger Design Not messing with the good stuff, Oppo oversized the delightful looks of its R series handsets. The Oppo R7 Plus is a plus-sized smartphone for serious phablet lovers only – for ones that wouldn't mind carrying a 6-inch screen behemoth out and about. Still, its dimensions of 6.22 x 3.23 x 0.31 inches (158 x 82 x 7.75 mm) are pretty reasonable for such a literal heavyweight – the R7 Plus weighs 6.8 oz (192 g), feeling solid and definitely heavy! Also of note is that Oppo managed a very good screen-to-body ratio of nearly 77%, successfully eliminating much of the unwanted fluff around the R7 Plus' screen. The Oppo R7 Plus is also a good-looking and tightly constructed smartphone. It is rectangular, with rounded corners for a better grip, and its sides are decorated with chamfered grooves. The body is fashioned out of a magnesium-aluminum alloy that's supposedly undergone 48 polishing processes. Yet, plastic still plays part in the formula, for there are two plastic bands on the back where the antennas are positioned. Meanwhile, the display is covered in shapely Arc Edge 2.5D glass, which is a fancy way of saying that the glass is contoured along the smartphone's edges for an elegant "flowing" effect. Aside from the camera, the R7 Plus has a fingerprint scanner on its back, along with a single loudspeaker. The scanner is shaped as a rounded rectangle. Reaching for it feels easy and natural with the index finger, but the fingerprint recognition isn't as immediate as we hoped. Getting it to accurately respond upon the first try is really a question of touching the sensor at the precise right spot. Sometimes it takes us two to three tries to unlock the device , so we have to rate the scanner as average and not entirely reliable. Then again, perhaps a software update could improve its performance? While it may not have the iPhone 6's precise contours or the HTC One M9 's hand-polished sheen, the R7 Plus certainly has its charm and has been built with attention to detail. But excellence in appearance isn't always a sign of practicality. Thankfully, the gripes we have with Oppo's phablet are hardly deal-breaking. Firstly, the R7 Plus is completely flat and doesn't lend itself to your hand quite like other big smartphones, such as the LG G4 , do. Also, the volume buttons (set to the left) are stiff and shallow, although they do give out a nice click. The Oppo R7 Plus is a dual-SIM smartphone with a catch. The SIM card tray houses either two Nano SIM cards or one Nano SIM card and one microSD card simultaneously. Now, there are more refined designs out there – the dual-SIM Sony Xperia Z3+ can fit two Nano SIM cards and a microSD card on a single tray thanks to Sony 's clever engineering. Hopefully, Oppo and others in the business will catch up to that. Display A display that gets the job done, though not a very true-to-life one. The Oppo R7 Plus flaunts a 6-inch 1080x1920 resolution Super AMOLED display with a pixel density of 367 pixels per inch. This makes for a crisp image, although not as crisp as what you'd see on a Quad-HD resolution screen of similar size. We can easily tell you this is a display that gets the job done, but there are many areas where we were hoping to see better performance out of it. The display's color temperature measures at 8149 Kelvin, which is quite cold. This results in a blueish tint that isn't distracting, but stands in the way of natural color reproduction. The average gamma value of 2.14 indicates that the grayscale brightness is rather accurate, but the unwanted blueish hue observed when displaying shades of grey is noticeable. The maximum brightness level we measured was 329 nits, which is workable, but not entirely sufficient for comfortable use under bright sunlight. Also, the glass cover on the R7 Plus is quite reflective. On the other hand, we measured a minimum brightness level of 4 nits, which is adequate for bedtime reading. Mind you, the R7 Plus has a built-in feature for reducing the overly stimulating blue light emitted by its display. As for color balance, our test results show that the green and cyan shades, in particular, are rather overblown. The white point drifts into blue, red is under-represented, and green is far from the reference values. This isn't a deal-breaker, though, for the color balance is still tolerable. The image isn't washed out or overly dynamic. Still, the Oppo R7's panel does exhibit a fair bit of brightness drop and color distortion when viewed at a 45-degree angle, typical of AMOLED screens. But the image still holds up well compared to the average IPS LCD screen. You can trust it to remain clear and visible under all but the most extreme viewing angles.. 6.22 x 3.23 x 0.31 inches. 158 x 82 x 7.75 mm. 6.27 x 3.27 x 0.4 inches. 159.26 x 82.98 x 10.06 mm. 6.04 x 3.09 x 0.33 inches. 153.5 x 78.6 x 8.5 mm. 5.86 x 3 x 0.39 inches. 148.9 x 76.1 x 9.8 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The numbers below represent the amount of deviation in the respective property, observed when a display is viewed from a 45-degree angle as opposed to direct viewing.. Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. OPPO R7 Plus Compare.

True that if the phone is below par on it's main function which is to perform well also with the graphics if it has such a large screen, then the main function of the phone is kinda worthless.

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ hands-on: The devil is in the details. Oppo's R7 Plus squeezes a big battery into a slim body. Nope, these aren't the near-bezel-less phones that Oppo teased us with back in March, but they are still very compelling. Following the super slim R5 , the Chinese company has shifted its focus back to specs with two new models: the 5-inch R7 and the 6-inch R7 Plus. For us, it's really all about the bigger phone: its 7.75mm-thick aluminum unibody manages to pack a generous 4,100 mAh battery, which goes very well with Oppo's renowned VOOC rapid charging -- a feature that's proven to be faster than most of its competitors'. Not to mention that the device also comes with a single-touch fingerprint sensor on the back, along with an 8-megapixel f/2.4 front imager plus a 13-megapixel f/2.2 main camera with an RGBW sensor (Sony's IMX278) for better sensitivity in the dark, as well as laser auto-focus and dual-tone LED flash.. Gallery: Oppo R7 and R7 Plus | 13 Photos. Since the R series isn't Oppo's flagship line, it's no surprise to see a 1.5GHz octa-core Snapdragon 615 chipset on this Android 5.1 phone, but you still get 3GB of RAM, a vibrant 1080p AMOLED display, a handful of LTE bands (there's a US model as well) and dual Nano SIM slots -- one of which doubles as a microSD slot, should you need more than 32GB of storage.. The smaller R7 has almost identical specs, with the only differences being you get just 16GB of storage (thank goodness for the microSD expansion), a 2,320 mAh battery (which goes from zero to 75 percent in just 30 minutes), single LED flash, no laser auto-focus and no fingerprint sensor. On the other hand, it's only 6.3mm thick and 147 grams heavy (instead of 203 grams, but even that isn't too bad for the size). Design-wise, the R7 has the added benefit of a slightly tapered frame that adds a little comfort to your grip, and it's also something nice to look at up close.. The sad news is that the R7 is only launching with Android 4.4 in China tomorrow, followed by international markets in mid-June, but it'll eventually be updated given that the R7 Plus will be pre-loaded with Android 5.1 come August. As for pricing, the R7 is available for 2,499 yuan which is about $400, whereas the R7 Plus will be sold for 2,999 yuan or about $480, both of which are pretty decent for the specs and how solid the devices are.. android , coloros , hands-on , mobilepostcross , oppo , oppo r7 , Oppo R7 plus , phone , r7 , r7 plus , r7plus , vooc.

The new smartphone release by Oppo going by the name of Oppo R7 Plus is a magnificently powerful device that carries the weight on its shoulder to further boost the name of the company.

This smartphone aims to fulfill the needs of portable multimedia communicating device of the Filipinos.. This mobile has brought features that many brands would just dream about, within a certain price range. The impressive phone build is equally backed by features including:.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars Oppo R7 Plus. Only thing was this was the chinese version which wasnt displayed at time of purchase. Got it to work with Google tho.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Hot phone at good prices (in some places) that needs some improvements. 7.5/10, at times 8/10 This is my first Oppo, and I have a mix of feelings about it. I mostly love it but it falls short at times if I compare it with my old lovely Samsung. HITS > The phone looks like a million dollar phone, with its round edges, golden case and metal build. The good thing it cost you half the price of most super-duper phones out there (out of the States at least!). > Battery is awesome! and charges fully in less than an hour and 15 minutes of recharging will get you a long way. The battery lasts for two days easily. Perfect for people with poor sight or who want to use the phone as a phablet for reading and browsing comfortably. > Awesome resolution, detail and vibrant colours. > Very good camera, with a selection of lovely filters so you don't need to install any extra app unless you really want. > Very responsive to touch, and silky feeling when gliding your fingers. > Fast processor, so apps open/close fast, the network system activates/deactivates in a second, and everything runs smoothly, almost as if you were using your laptop. > 4G lite capable, but you can use your 2G or 3G card without a problem. > The phone comes with some goodies that one usually gets from the apps store: torch, cleaner program, compass, eye protection filter, apps locking system, back up and restore system, clear memory tool, a mini-office pack called KinsoftOffice, and a theme and a free wallpaper store with plenty of gorgeous "wallies" and themes. Of course, the basics from Google are also there. > You can do most things just with your fingers. Double tap to lock and unlock if you want, use gestures for whatever you want, or use the fingerprint reader to unlock locked apps. > A silicone transparent case is included in the box; not flashy but it does the job. MISSES > ColorOS system seats upon Android OS. ColorOS is simpler and easier to operate than pure Android, but also less polished and organised; on the other hand, ColorOS has way better graphics and better gesture functionality than a pure Android. Good news, Oppo are launching a new OS soon, which will be closer to the original Android but keeping the improvements of ColorOS. The release of the new system for this specific model, is according to Oppo, around beginning of 2016. > You can install just two SIM cards. If you want to use a SD memory card, you can only use one SIM. That is a bit behind in design like three or four years behind. > The battery cannot be extracted and replaced when the fatal moment arrives. How long does the internal battery lasts? Dunno because it is not mentioned anywhere. However, it is mentioned that when that happens you need to contact Oppo's CS. > Manual of instructions is non-existent. It should be installed in the phone, but it is not! The paper booklet in the packaging is worthless. MIND + You might need to swap your current micro SIM card with a NANO card with your current carrier. Most phone carriers do that on the phone for free and the swap takes about 1-2 hours to happen. + The card tray "pin" opener is lovely set on the top of the phone case once you open the packaging and is so flat and shaped like Oppo logo that you might miss it as such! I am always looking for alternatives to Apple and Samsung or any other company that monopolises the market and demands ridiculous prices for phones. Oppo is a promising cool young Chinese company doing innovative things, offering mid range good phones. However, the Company should apply a bit of more common sense and launch phones and OS when they are ready not months earlier. Oppo already has my money, my love is growing, I purchased this phone for less than half the marked price and got a power bank for free... If I had to pay 800+ bucks for a phone I would be buying one of the latest Galaxy S Samsung. Honestly! WAYS TO SAVE TONS OF BATTERY LIFE IN YOUR OPPO After many months of constant use of my Oppo, I have found that, since switching on and off some features works fast and wonderfully, you better keep off some features that will suck your battery. + Switch off the GPS unless necessary. Most of the time is not. + Switch off the Wi-fi unless you are going to use it or using it. + Switch off the Data connection unless you are going to use it. If you keep it on while idle, it will suck up part of your battery. Using data all day long is one of the highest eaters of energy. + Switch off the screen auto-rotation functionality. Some apps automatically rotate the screen even if you have that option switched off. + Unless really necessary, switch off all the sounds, like messaging sound, typing sounds, calendar sounds, notifications sounds. + Unless really necessary, keep your mobile on vibration or silent. I do that during working hours, so I am not interrupted. But when I am not, the phone consumes way more energy, just because that option is on. + Activate the power saving function. + Bear in mind that high brightness of the screen and keeping the screen on for a long time consumes a huge amount of energy. TROUBLESHOOTING I keep my phone on all the time, as if it was a land line. At times, after many days without switching off, the phone does funny things, like I start to have problems with the Internet connection, or some functions or apps seems to behave oddly, or the battery seems not to recharge normally. Solution: Restart your phone or switch it off for 1-2 minutes and switch on again. I have found that this a great magic wand that solves everything! UPDATE MARCH 2016 After a few months of constant use, I have to say that this phone ticks all the boxes that I wanted a medium-range phone to tick. The downsides I mentioned above are still there, I got used to the lack of drawer and how the phone organises files, but now I am familiar with that and is no longer an issue. The overall performance of the phone and the life of the battery are great, the phone is great for light gaming, and the the inbuilt connectivity range is great. I constantly switch between WI-Fi and prepaid data, use flight mode on and off, and everything works timely and smoothly. The more I use my Oppo the more a I love it and the more I want this company to do better. It would be great if they did a new version that allowed a double SIM card plus a memory card. I love the KingsoftOffice pack, which works greatly for every-day use of Office software, and costs you nothing. I don't like the in-built weather app as I like other weather apps best,. The inbuilt mail app, which worked greatly until last week, began doing funny things and I realised that it cannot be upgraded or reset; there must be a way to do it, but there is no manual of instructions. However, there are many mail apps on Google Store and that is never going to be a problem. I still think that extractable batteries are way better for consumers than in-built ones. It is just better for the company to have it the other way around. UPDATE NOV 2017 My first Oppo and I will stick with the brand. Not a scratch since I first wrote this review, intact functionality, device working as new. The only thing that is old, is the case. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars has replaced two apple handsets. I bought this to replace two iphone 6 handsets on vodafone contracts - one for work and one for home - I was getting sick of carrying two around. I moved the two NANO SIM's over after using Wondershare MobileTrans to copy all my photos, contacts and texts over automatically from one of the iphones to the OPPO phone. I have used Android before and enjoyed it - i don't tend to be loyal to any company, have owned a Windows phone in the past too. The Oppo R7 is actually better than I thought it would be, its built like a flagship phone and they even supply a gel cover for the back of the phone which was a bit of shock, having been used to Apple in recent years. Android has improved a lot in the last 2 years since I last used it and the dual SIM configuration is bulletproof and I haven't had any problems. ColorOS updated for me on first boot and its been quite snappy. I am not interested in games as I use a tablet for mobile gaming and the 3GB of memory and processor hasn't seemed slow yet. The only downside I can see with this phone is that only one of the SIM's can be in auto 4G mode with the other forced to run in 2G. This is fine for me as I set SIM 1 for work in 4G and the data SIM is also configured for SIM 1. 2G is fine for phone calls from friends and relatives, although you can swap which SIM gets auto 4G in settings without a reboot or having to swap over SIM positions in the phone itself. I haven't read many reviews of this phone but it hasn't been made clear that this 2G limitation for one SIM is actually how it works. For me its not a problem, but if you are buying this phone for a standard mobile contract in SIM 1 and a data contract in SIM 2, you will have to run one of them in 2G. Battery life seems good so far, although the iPhone 6 Plus appears better as IOS is very heavily optimised for this. I haven't spent a lot of time yet customising settings for this, so further improvements could be made. The AMOLED screen may only be 1080p, but the colours are very bright and vibrant and the speaker delivers an incredible amount of volume, if little bass. Headphones are advised if you want to watch movies, but the ringer volume is very loud indeed, same on half volume as the iphone 6 plus on full. iPhone 6 audio for netflix and amazon movies is better however. The star of the show is the charging system for the oppo R7, the VOOC fast charging system (only available via the charger they supply, not via a computer USB port) is incredibly quick. I started charging at 5% battery life and it took around 30 minutes to give me close to 80%! this is an incredible feature for quick, on the move charges if you can get access to a plug. The next one I want to play with is the Huawei Mate 8, which is a flagship dual sim phone priced like the iPhone 6 Plus. For the money however the Oppo R7 is very impressive, especially with the latest software update for the OS.. Was this review helpful to you?.

High-end features at an upper-mid-range price make the Oppo R7 Plus great value, but a relative lack of processing power and RAM compared to the competition mean it comes up short in terms of ultimate performance.. Ever since we first went hands-on with the Oppo R7 Plus in China, I've been waiting to put it through its paces more thoroughly. Back then we were impressed with the flagship-level specs, performance and features, but most of all with the apparent price, which would have put it firmly in the mid-range price band.. Now the Oppo R7 Plus has arrived, and it's a little more expensive than we anticipated at £319 SIM-free. So, with the OnePlus 2 already in the marketplace and in roughly the same price band, how does the Oppo R7 Plus hold up?. The inspiration for the Oppo R7 Plus is clear – hold it up to an iPhone 6 Plus and it's immediately obvious that the Chinese manufacturer has worked hard to ape Apple's flagship. This is a shame in many respects, because the Oppo R7 Plus is more than capable of standing on its own two feet, and the slavish mimicry rather cheapens the overall effect.. Oppo's imitation of Apple isn't limited to the hardware either. Its ColorOS build of Android (5.1.1 at the time of this review) shamelessly copies many of the visual cues of iOS, from the deep-space wallpapers to the camera interface.. From camera screens to wallpapers, the iPhone influence runs throughout ColorOS.. Put the obvious comparisons aside, though, and you're left with a well-designed if unspectacular-looking handset. Oppo's gone for a mix of curves and corners that work well together, the former on the rear making the phone sit comfortably in your hand and the latter giving your fingertips something to grip around the front of the screen.. There are two colour options – silver and white, and the gold and white one tested here – and they feature an aluminium unibody construction that's generous on the brushed metal.. The Oppo R7 Plus feels solidly put together, too, and despite its size I was never worried about it flexing or breaking. On the subject of size, it is big – the 6-inch screen puts it firmly in phablet territory and, thanks to the scalability of Android, it never feels like a simple upscaling exercise. The screen might not stretch all the way to the edge of the frame, but it gets close enough that you're never aware of significant dead bands.. The Oppo R7 Plus has a 6-inch AMOLED screen, and unsurprisingly it's the first thing you notice about the phone. Fully six inches in size, and with a resolution of 1920 by 1080, it's a sight to behold. It's not just good on paper, either – it's evenly backlit, and bright enough to be decently visible outdoors in the sun, too. The viewing angles are generous and, as you'd hope on a handset like this, movies and games look incredible.. You can save up to five fingerprints for unlocking the handset, and Oppo's ColorOS responds swiftly and fluidly. There's no way of replacing in-app passwords with a fingerprint, but you can use it to encrypt apps if you want, adding an extra layer of security.. On the subject of ColorOS, Oppo promises a smoother, faster Android experience. Given that the phone features 3GB of RAM and an octo-core processor, you'd expect a seamless user interface anyway, but it certainly doesn't harm matters.. More than a launcher with a few gimmicks, Oppo's gone beneath the bonnet of Android to tweak and streamline the OS. This means you're stuck with ColorOS, even when you install and run other launchers on top of it – ColorOS continues to run at full steam in the background.. In light use, you won't notice the performance hit – there's enough headroom to enable the third-party launcher to run smoothly alongside everything else. But start opening multiple apps and the RAM being consumed by both ColorOS and whatever other launcher you favour starts to become a factor.. Other highlights include support for two SIMs, or a single SIM and microSD memory card to expand on the 32GB internal memory, and fast charging. Oppo promises 20 minutes of talk time on just five minutes' charge from empty, and this appears to be accurate – from dead I got between 15% and 20% on the tests I ran..

Oppo launches R7 and R7 Plus. Oppo launches R7 and R7 Plus. Chinese manufacturer Oppo has today launched its new duo of flagship phones, the R7 and R7 Plus. The R7 features a 5-inch 1080p screen while its 6-inch screen with the same resolution places the Plus model firmly into phablet territory.. However, screen size is far from the. only difference between the two models. In the camera department both smartphones combine a 13MP sensor with an F2.2 lens but the R7 Plus chip is, like the Huawei P8 , of the RGBW variant and supported by laser-AF and a dual-LED flash. The R7 comes with a conventional sensor and has to make do without the laser and with a single-LED flash unit. Oppo claims compared to conventional sensors the RGBW chip in the R7 Plus reduces image noise by 78% and is 32% more light sensitive.. The two models also differ in battery size. The R7 comes with a 2,320mAh cell while the the R7 Plus offers a much larger 4,100mAh battery. The Plus model also comes with a fingerprint sensor in its back cover. Qualcomm 615 system chip with 64-bit octa-core processor and 3GB RAM to power Android 5.1 and Oppo's ColorOS 2.1. The R7 Plus packs 32GB of storage while the smaller model has to make do with 16GB. Both offer dual-SIM capability and alternatively one of the slots can house a microSD card.. Both models will be available in China from tomorrow and will be launched internationally in June. The R7 retails at CNY 2,499 (approximately $400) while the larger model will set you back approximately $480.. Tags: mobile , android , news , oppo. Oppo R7 Plus results on Amazon.com.

OPPO audio equipments are superb but their phones are just ok.. I'm not into phones that much a photographic tool just using my Nexus 5 when I have forgotten the camera.. The one thing that would tempt me to charge my phone is one with a higher capacity battery. My phone is fine for day to day use when I am in work where I can plug it into the laptop to charge but i'ts not much use if I can't find a power source at some point if I have been using GPS etc.. So whenever I see a phone with a larger battery that grabs my attention. The trouble is they all seen to be phablet sized.. Why can't manufacturers put a top spec phone together that isn't a phablet more often?. It's the battery technology limitations at the moment. Some new fast charging technology lets you get to about 75%+ charge in about 10-15 mins now. But I'm sure that will affect the life of the battery. But if the phone allows for battery removal, and the batteries are not too expensive, then this may be the way of the future. Kind of like the Tesla car battery swapping stations.. I went from nexus 4 to Nokia 735. I agree battery longevity is a game changer. I can browse all day. The nexus I'd browse for an hour and it would be all over. I'm not a massive fan of windows phone but I've kept using it because of the battery: Having a high spec aluminum bodied super mega doodad is pointless without them whizzing electrons. Oppo manufacture very high-end audiophile grade planar driver headphones, universal disc players and DAC/headphone amps that generally receive rave reviews. But this smartphone division of theirs is very lacklustre by comparison and nothing on the Samsung S6 series. A 6" 1080p display - that's very two years ago!. "Qualcomm 615 system chip with 64-bit octa-core processor". Why is that that to get good things one has to buy the king-sized device? It's the same for Xperias and Galaxys... and I don't want another tablet in my pocket, 5" should be enough for a cellphone IMHO.. Because these 'good things' take up more space and eat through batteries faster, which necessitates a larger battery and in turn more space? ;). Well, I don't like phone screens smaller than 6", which is why I currently have one that is 6.2", which remains on a belt clip on my waist. You like smaller screens, I like bigger screens. @FantasticMrFox (hey same on PF? :-) ) I never said anything about thickness... and I could forego screen res too.. @p51d007 Having much more features on phablets than on smartphones is not "choice", is steering the market. You can hardly find top-of-the-range phones with a screen less than 5". They have all the rights to do that, but to me that's bo***cks.... @LensBeginner: What is this 'PF' and who is that clone of mine active on there? I will have to grab my K3 and gather evide ... ah, I gave it away :D. When reading RGBW, I was thinking about W, which lets R, G and B through. At first sight, that increases sensitivity. Why do most cameras filter RGB separately? It's quite a waste of photons. They get absorbed in the filters. It should be possible to filter combined colors, such as red and green, i.e. That would give the same information, with much less waste. Looking at the Wikipedia article about color filter arrays, I see that Kodak used CYYM filters in a few cameras. Why isn't that the standard? What's the disadvantage?. Or is the RGB filter array for the Bayer pattern nowadays realized using small prisms, that redirect different frequencies to different pixels, thereby not wasting any photons in absorption?. You can buy the Leica Monochrome that doesn't waste any photons at all, but is B&W only. The other possibility would be to use a trichroic prism and three separate sensors. It's done in some video cam as I recollect. As far as having millions of trichroic prisms with photosensitive sites around them, that's a fascinating idea but from all I know still sci fi. My intuition is that in most images there is a strong correlation between channels, hence interpolation pays off , that is you can guess the missing channels info at one photo site from the available channel and surrounding photo sites, as opposed to, say, having three separate sensors with 1/3 resolution that capture every channel at every position. Anyway a nice project could be to buy a optical quality trichroic prism, three leica monochromes ($$ alert) and make a rig that implements your idea. It won't beat medium format with bayer filter in convenience, but you'd have satisfied your curiosity.. Always google first! Check out 3MOS technology by Panasonic.. 3MOS looks like 3CCD - I'm aware of that. No, I was wondering why CYYM is not used instead of RGGB. It looks like a cheap solution to get twice the amount of light onto the sensor.. Anyhow, moved to the forum: http://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/55853975. Human eyes are RGB, JPEG is roughly RWB.. Maybe making a filter glass which lets all of red and blue light in while filtering out all green in hard.. What you gain in light sensitivity, you lose in color info. Early test of Huawei P8 (using the RGBW) has confirmed this.. This is not the 1st gen SONY RGBW sensor. If my memory serves, the 1st gen was used by LG G2, which was an utter failure. Let's wait and see how this 2nd gen plays out.. Feels a bit spendy from a brand that isn't well known in the US. Especially today when you can just get a Zenfone 2 for $200 and it has basically the same specs, including a 13MP sensor.. "alternatively one of the slots can house a microSD card" - I don't think I have seen that before. I've seen it before, I think the Moto G LTE version does the same, not 100% sure though, it might have been another one.... Very interesting ? Really ? I own a 60 euros smartphone that features two SIM slots AND one uSD slot. I do not have to choose between either two SIMs or one SIM and one uSD card... Moreover my cheap smartphone was specified to support a uSD card max size of 32GB and is currently happy with a 64GB one with more than 32GB of stuff on it.. there are other Chinese phones that have a second slot that can house either a microSIM or a microSD card, such as for example the Huawei Ascend Mate7, but many others have this expansion-limitation. Others instead have 3 slots: two slots for mini and/or microSIM and one slot for a microSD memory card only.. Every mid-range Android has 1080p nowadays. I wouldn't call anything without a quad-HD screen a "flagship.". Well Oppo managed to turn heads/ears with much better midrange CD/SACD/DVD/Blueray players.. Oppo doesn't really do "Us too" gear.. Brand Oppo players however is kind of different from the mobile manufacturer from what i know, i could be wrong and cannot back up my statement, but this i've heard.. The Oppo name looks to be the exact same logo design.. well, it is the Oppo flagship despite phones from other manufacturers possibly having better specs :). True, but when you use the word "flagship", people tend to think of it as state-of-the-art. Unless it's an Apple product, of course... Seriously though, who really needs more than 1080p on a phone with a screen smaller than 6 inches.. (says the man with a Samsung Galaxy S6..). Well let's hope they have good sound cards and shoot raw.. Nokia 8 Sirocco features 2x optical zoom and Carl Zeiss optics. Samsung unveils Galaxy S9 with variable aperture and super-slow-motion.

OPPO R7 Plus review The metal build, insane battery life, and ample screen real estate make this phone a winner.. by Lanh Nguyen August 24, 2015. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. The OPPO R7 Plus may be a bit pricier than your usual mid-range smartphone, but it is definitely worth the price!. The OPPO R7 has proven to be a solidÂ. very few sacrifices and a price point that can’t be easily beat. It has been a couple months since we reviewed that phone, and now we find ourselvesÂ. holding its larger brother, the OPPO R7 Plus.. As you can expect, the Plus version is definitely larger, but what else can the handset bring to the table?Â. I have been playing around with the OPPO R7 Plus long enough and am ready to tell you all about it, so let’s get this review started.. The OPPO R7 had a great design, so it only makes sense that the Plus iteration follows the same course. In terms of aesthetics, the OPPO R7 Plus does pretty much look like a larger R7. The metallic body curves around theÂ. sides, where you can find chamfered edges extending along the entire perimeter of the device.. Metal phones are no joke, and the OPPO R7 Plus feels great. One thing is for sure, though, this is definitely one large smartphone. It helps that it’s only 7.8 mm thick, but one-handing it will still be complicated for most users. This is no big deal for those who prefer larger smartphones, but one can become uneasy when handling it, especially considering the phone’s smooth finish makes it feel rather slippery.. Buttons are conveniently placed on the left and right of the device, making shuffling less of a problem. You can find the 3.5 mm headset jack up top and the microUSB port on the bottom. On the front you have your usual set-up: there’s a screen, a front-facing cameras, an LED notification light, the ambient system and the proximity sensor. Turn the phone around and you will find the main camera, a fingerprint reader and a single speaker.. We know the OPPO R7 Plus has a large screen, but that is only part of theÂ. There are many factors that can make or break a display. We must keep in mind this is an affordable phone, though, so we can’t expect it to do miracles.. The OPPO R7 Plus display is good, but it’s nothing to really write home about. For starters, the 6-inch Super AMOLED panel only has a 1080p resolution. At 6 inches you can start noticing some pixels, but the 367 ppi pixel density is still pretty good. You won’t have trouble reading texts or enjoying your media.. Because this phone does sport a Super AMOLED panel, you willÂ. enjoy the deep blacks and vibrant colors these screens are so known for. The display does also have good viewing angles and brightness, making it a pleasure to view in direct sunlight.. The internals in the OPPO R7 Plus are identical to those in the smaller iteration. The device sports a Snapdragon 615 processor and 3 GB of RAM.Â. This chipset has proven to be a success with other handsets, and we see no exception here. This little guy runs great, especially once you start noticing the ColorOS optimizations, which make boot times and app launching faster.. I experienced no hiccups during my time with this handset, and that is saying much for a $480Â. I played games and used the phone for all my daily purposes, so it’s not like I went easy on it either. And event though ColorOS can be a bit heavy, everything was smooth sailing.. Oh, and just in case you were wondering – the phone doesn’t overheat. Sure, it gets warm after long gaming periods, but that is to be expected.. Other hardware includes the typical technology: WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, LTE, etc. One downside many of you won’t be fond of is that the phone only comes with 32 GB. There are no other options, but OPPO did make up for that by adding microSD card support.. If we move to the back and take a look at that single speaker, you will find the sound is nothing extraordinary. It gets the job done, but that’s about it. I am also not a fan of the speaker placement (it’s on the back). We found it very easy to muffle the sound, whether you are holding the phone or laying it flat on a table.. There’s another interesting piece of hardware back there, though. One that you will probably enjoy more. That fingerprint scanner is convenient, as well as very reliable. This scanner is as fast and accurate as those in the Galaxy S6, HTC One M9+ or even the iPhone. Seeing fingerprint readers on the back of devices is no longer rare, and I happen to be a fan of putting them on the back of handsets, as that is where one’s index finger naturally rests.. For many of us, this is the most important factor. We want to know smartphones can keep up with our busy days. Thankfully, the OPPO R7 Plus has a gigantic 4100 mAh battery. The phone usually surpasses the 5-hour screen on time, even if I am playing games and streaming video. In fact, the phone usually lasted me a whole day and a good part of the second. It was hard to kill it in one day, to be honest.. And if you do run out of battery, the OPPO R7 Plus sports VOOC rapid charging. This is specially good in this over-sized phone, which would usually take a long time to charge.. The camera is another very important factor, and OPPO is not skimping out on this department. The R7 Plus comes with a 13 MP main shooter featuring an f/2.2 aperture andÂ. Schneider-Kreuznach optics, as well as laser auto-focus and an LED flash. On the front we have an 8 MP camera, which should also make you look great in video calls and selfies.Â. But hey, those are just numbers. How well does the camera actually perform? It really does. Images in normal light are sharp and offer plenty of detail. In addition, color accuracy is outstanding, dynamic range is decent and shooting speeds are quite snappy.. Once you move to a darker environment, things change. slower, but ultimately results are actually quite great (all things considered). This is mostly because of OPPO’s RGBW sensor, which adds a white pixel to to the usual RGB set-up. This is said to increase light sensitivity by 32% and reduce noise by 78%.. In terms of software, you will find a very simple camera interface. You can easily swipe your way between shooting modes. You can also tap on an icon to reveal functions likeÂ. beautify, ultra HD, slow shutter, live filters, GIFS,Â. In terms of software, we are looking at Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, with OPPO’s ColorOS on top. If you are looking for the difference between the R7 and R7 plus, this is pretty much the biggest one. The smaller device was launched with Android 4.4 KitKat. You won’t be able to tell the difference very well, though, as ColorOS hides every aesthetic element you can find in either of these Android versions.. The UI looks very similar to what you find in other Chinese smartphones. There is no app drawer, and your home screens house every app in your phone. If you can get past that, you will find ColorOS is actually quite simple, sleek and pleasant. The icons, transparencies and colors happen to look rather good.. In addition, you can enjoy features like double tapping to wake, drawing an “O” in the screen to launch the camera and even set your very own gestures. These features may seem gimmicky, but they can actually be quite helpful if you take the time to set them up.. The OPPO R7 Plus find itself in a tight spot, because it’s not really a high-end handset, but it’s also not at the same level as most other mid-range devices. This is something the price also corroborates, as the phone is expected to launch at about $480. You can pay about $300 for many other affordable smartphones, but with those you happen to make much more sacrifices.. Sure, the device is no steal, but we believe the price is justifiable. This thing is made of metal, has insane battery life and ample screen real estate. Not to mention performance is still great. reasons, we’re giving the excellent OPPO R7 Plus ourÂ.

Oppo claims compared to conventional sensors the RGBW chip in the R7 Plus reduces image noise by 78% and is 32% more light sensitive.. The 4,100mAh battery should offer plenty of power and the Plus model also comes with a fingerprint sensor in its back cover.

Bezelless it was going to be, the first of its kind, but the Oppo R7 Plus didn't quite live to the promised edge-to-edge display. Yet, you'd be foolish to dismiss it on those grounds alone, as there's so more to a smartphone than the size of its frame.. So what if the ZTE Nubia Z9 actually has pixels spilled all the way to the sides, and the R7 Plus doesn't? Oppo's 6-inch phablet, positioned where midrange meets flagship, has a wonderful metal build and an appearance worthy of its top-shelf aspirations.. The smartphone does accomplish the bezelless look with the screen off, but fire it up and the illusion is shattered. Even so, the R7 Plus boasts an impressive screen-to-body ratio - and while you may think that's nothing but a catch phrase, it's arguably one of the more meaningful scores in today's numbers race.. We're yet to see someone disagree that battery life is something we just never seem to have enough of. Oppo has done its best and fitted a mammoth battery inside the R7 Plus, and also equipped it with the in-house fast charging tech, so it doesn't take a decade to fill up.. A flagship-grade chipset would have been most welcome, given the rest of the specs, but the R7 Plus makes do with Qualcomm's ubiquitous upper-midrange Snapdragon 615. So be it, it won't win performance awards but typically makes for a fine daily driver. The 3GB of RAM and a generous 32GB of expandable storage shouldn't leave you wanting either.. Oppo has taken a different path with the camera of the R7 Plus, compared to the regular R7. A Sony IMX278 sensor replaces the Samsung ISOCELL imager and the phase detection autofocus has made way to a laser mechanism, so we'll need to see how this new combo fares..
