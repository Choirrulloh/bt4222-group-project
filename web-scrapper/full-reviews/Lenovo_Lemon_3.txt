Harga Lenovo Lemon 3 – TEKNOKITA.COM – Persaingan dunia gadget khsusnya smartphone di tahun 2016 ini nampaknya akan semakin sengit, terbukti dengan adanya Lenovo yang menghadirkan smartphone bernama Lenovo Lemon 3, smartphone ini akan menjadi pesaing utama bagi Xiaomi Redmi 3 yang belum lama ini secara resmi di rilis dan habis terjual dalam hitungan detik saja. Larisnya Smartphone Xiaomi Redmi 3 di sebabkan karena smartphone tersebut di banderol dengan harga yang sangat murah namun di bekali dengan spesifikasi yang tinggi dengan kualitas yang sangat baik.. Nah tidak mau kalah dengan Xiaomi, Lenovo juga menghadirkan Smartphone Lenovo Lemon 3 ini dengan spesifikasi yang sangat mumpuni dan di jual dengan harga yang sangat terjangkau. Sama-sama di bekali dengan desain body bermaterialkan metal menjadikan smartphone ini akan menjadi penantang berat bagi Xiaomi Redmi 3. Menariknya Lenovo Lemon 3 ini ternyata lebih unggul pada sektor resolusi layar yang di bawa. Pasalnya untuk Xiaomi Redmi 3 masih mengandalkan resolusi HD 720p, sedangkan untuk Lenovo Lemon 3 sudah mengandalkan resolusi Full HD 1080p.. Selain berbekal resolusi yang besar, Lenovo juga membekali dapur pacunya dengan spesifikasi yang tinggi. Pasalnya sudah mengusung processor Octa Core yang di padukan dengan Ram berukuran 2 GB. Untuk menambah kehebatan ponsel terbarunya, Lenovo juga memberikan media penyimpanan internal sebesar 16 GB, dan masih bisa di perluas menggunakan slot microSD hingga 128 GB.. Spesifikasi Lenovo Lemon 3 memang tidak berbeda jauh dari Xiaomi Redmi 3. Hanya saja ukuran baterainya lebih kecil, dan kameranya belum di lengkapi dengan teknologi phase detection autofocus. Namun di balik kekurangan tersebut, Lenovo Lemon 3 menawarkan layar beresolusi lebih tinggi di bandingkan milik Redmi 3, sehingga kualitas gambar yang di keluarkan akan jauh lebih baik. Nah untuk lebih jelasnya lagi, mari simak review selengkapnya mengenai Spesifikasi dan Harga Lenovo Lemon 3 yang telah kami rangkum seperti berikut ini. Untuk mengalahkan Xiaomi Redmi 3, Lenovo membekali ponsel ini dengan layar beresolusi tinggi. Tak tanggung-tanggung, Lenovo langsung mempersenjatai Lenovo Lemon 3 dengan layar beresolusi Full HD 1080 x 1920 pixels yang di padukan dengan teknologi layar sentuh IPS (In-Plane Switching) dengan kepadatan layar mencapai -441 ppi. Sudah pasti kualitas gambarnya akan jauh lebih jernih di bandingkan layar HD 720p milik Redmi 3, sehingga setiap konten yang di putar akan memiliki kualitas warna lebih tajam, dan pastinya lebih nyaman di pandang mata.. Sayangnya layar Lenovo Lemon 3 belum di lindungi oleh lapisan anti gores, sehingga harus di tambahkan screen guard secara manual agar layar tetap terlindung saat di masukkan kedalam saku. Sedangkan untuk sektor desain, smartphone ini di balut bodi premium dengan material terbaik yang memiliki ukuran dimensi 142 x 71 x 7.99 mm, dan bobot 142 gram. Bentuknya yang tipis, dan bobotnya yang ringan menjadi salah satu kelebihan pada segi desain yang membuatnya tampak lebih premium dan elegan. Bahkan bisa di katakan desainnya tak kalah cantik dari Xiaomi Redmi 3.. Harga Lenovo Lemon 3 sejatinya sangat murah, namun Lenovo tetap membekalinya dengan komponen dapur pacu terbaik saat ini. Yang mana untuk dapur pacunya telah di perkuat chipset Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 yang di padukan processor Octa Core 1.5 Ghz yang masing-masing telah berjalan pada processor berkecepatan Quad Core 1.5 Ghz Cortex-A53 + Quad Core 1.2 Ghz Cortex-A53. Selain itu, performa Lenovo Lemon 3 juga di topang Ram 2 GB yang membuat kinerja mulitasking semakin lancar. Lalu ada pula GPU Adreno 405 yang mengoptimalkan kinerja grafis ketika smartphone ini menjalankan game-game HD beresolusi tinggi.. Untuk menambah kehebatan ponsel terbarunya, Lenovo memberikan media penyimpanan internal sebesar 16 GB, dan di dukung penyimpanan eksternal microSD mencapai 128 GB. Dengan ukuran memori yang besar, tentunya semakin banyak file yang bisa anda simpan kedalam smartphone ini. Selain itu, Lenovo Lemon 3 juga di perkuat oleh sistem operasi Android Lollipop v5.1 yang menjaga kestabilan sistem agar bisa berjalan lebih lancar.. Kemudian untuk sumber dayanya, Lenovo Lemon 3 sudah mengandalkan baterai Li-Po berkapasitas 2.750 mAh yang di klaim memiliki waktu bicara selama 32 jam pada jaringan 2G. Kapasitas baterai Lenovo Lemon 3 lebih kecil di bandingkan baterai Xiaomi Redmi 3 yang memiliki kapasitas 4.100 mAh. Walaupun begitu, baterai tersebut masih bisa kita andalkan untuk mengakses internet pada jaringan 4G LTE saat menonton video streaming ataupun bermain game online.. Untuk konektivitasnya, Lenovo telah membekalinya dengan koneksi internet di jaringan 4G LTE Cat4 berkecepatan 150/50 Mbps, sehingga kita bisa mengakses internet dengan cepat apalagi jika di pakai untuk menonton video streaming ataupun bermain game online. Menariknya, kita akan di suguhkan kualitas audio memukau saat menonton video dan bermain game, berkat dua buah speaker yang tertanam pada casing belakang smartphone ini. Selain itu, tersedia pula teknologi Maxx Audio untuk memaksimalkan kualitas audio stereo yang di keluarkan Lenovo Lemon 3.. Sama seperti Lenovo K4 Note, smartphone ini juga telah di bekali 2 slot kartu sim yang mengadopsi sim-card berbentuk micro-sim. Kedua kartu yang anda masukkan nantinya akan aktif secara bersamaan, dan anda hanya tinggal memilih mana kartu yang akan di pakai untuk mengakses internet, dan kartu yang di pakai untuk berkomunikasi melalui sms atau telepon. Sementara untuk urusan mengirim data dan file, sudah di sediakan Bluetooth, microUSB 2.0, dan Wi-Fi dengan fitur Wi-Fi Direct. Tak sampai di situ saja, Lenovo juga membekali ponsel ini dengan navigasi GPS berteknologi A-GPS serta Glonass.. Pada bagian belakang Lenovo Lemon 3 telah terpasangkan lensa kamera dengan kekuatan 13 Megapixel. Kamera tersebut memiliki resolusi sangat tinggi, dan siap mengabadikan setiap momen berharga dengan kualitas jepretan foto dan rekaman video terbaik. Selain itu, Lenovo juga memberikan fitur autofocus dan led flash yang memaksimalkan kemampuan kamera agar bisa bersaing melawan Xiaomi Redmi 3 yang memiliki harga setara dengan harga Lenovo Lemon 3. Menariknya lagi, smartphone ini bisa di pakai untuk merekam video Full HD 1080p@30fps.. Smartphone yang memiliki kualitas audio stereo ini, juga memiliki kamera depan berkekuatan 5 Megapixel untuk mempermudah penggunanya saat berfoto selfie maupun video call. Hasil foto kamera depan Lenovo Lemon 3 akan sangat memukau, dan tidak memperlihatkan bahwa sebenarnya harga Lenovo Lemon 3 di banderol sangat murah. Inilah salah satu daya tarik yang di tawarkan Lenovo pada ponsel terbarunya, karena masih jarang ada smartphone semurah harga Lenovo Lemon 3 yang memiliki dua kamera beresolusi tinggi.. Selain memiliki spesifikasi yang hampir sama, rupanya harga Lenovo Lemon 3 juga sama persis dengan harga Xiaomi Redmi 3. Seperti yang kami lansir dari laman lenovo.com memperlihatkan bahwa harga Lenovo Lemon 3 di banderol sebesar 699 Yuan atau apabila kita rupiahkan setara dengan 1.4 Jutaan Rupiah. Lenovo memang sengaja memasarkan smartphone ini untuk bersaing melawan Xiaomi Redmi 3, sehingga wajar apabila mereka berani membanderol harga Lenovo Lemon 3 sangat murah, dan melengkapinya dengan spesifikasi tinggi seperti yang di miliki Redmi 3.. Berbekal harga Lenovo Lemon 3 yang di banderol sangat murah, pastinya Lenovo percaya diri untuk bersaing melawan Xiaomi dan vendor besar lainnya yang mulai merilis smartphone entry level berspesifikasi tinggi. Namun untuk saat ini, lawan terberat Lenovo Lemon 3 adalah Xiaomi Redmi 3, karena keduanya sama-sama di lengkapi processor Snapdragon 616 dengan Ram 2 GB. Sayangnya kapasitas baterai Lenovo Lemon 3 lebih kecil di bandingkan Redmi 3, namun smartphone ini jauh lebih unggul pada sektor layar, berkat pemakaian layar Full HD 1080p yang tak di miliki oleh Redmi 3.. Selain itu untuk sektor kamera juga sangat memukau, pasalnya Lenovo juga melengkapinya dengan dual kamera beresolusi tinggi. Untuk kamera belakang memiliki lensa berkekuatan 13 MP dan kamera depan memiliki lensa berkekuatan 5 MP. Menariknya lagi Lenovo telah menyematkan 2 buah speaker dengan teknologi Maxx Audio, sehingga bisa di pakai untuk memaksimalkan kualitas audio stereo yang di keluarkan Lenovo Lemon 3 pada saat menonton video ataupun saat bermain game di layar berukuran 5 inchi ini..

The Lenovo Lemon 3 has a superior display, but will this lead to poorer battery life? / © Lenovo. Xiaomi Redmi 3 vs Lenovo Lemon 3: Early verdict. Xiaomi Redmi 3 16GB - Gray. Lenovo Lemon 3 16GB - Silver. Glance at the Xiaomi Redmi 3 and you may notice a similarity in appearance to the slightly larger Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 , which dropped in November last year.. Its aluminum finish means it feels nice in the hand and the inclusion of three capacitive buttons gives you plenty of screen space to play with. The design of the Redmi 3 is fairly clean, although the Chinese manufacturer has managed to include a unique-looking textured back, comprised of dotted diamond shapes. The back of the Xiaomi Redmi 3 doesn't feature a fingerprint scanner, however, which the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 did. Even so, the price of the handset makes this omission easy to brush off.. On the other side of the fence, the metal-wearing Lenovo Lemon 3 arrives with a 5-inch screen, just like the Redmi 3, although this smartphone is ever so slightly lighter than Xiaomi's newest release. The back is even more minimal than Xiaomi's, simply featuring the Lenovo logo and not much else. It's not quite as eye-catching as the Redmi 3 in our minds.. As is the case with the Xiaomi Redmi 3, the Lenovo Lemon 3 features capacitive buttons below the display. The overall look of the phone reminds us of the Lenovo K3 Note.. When it comes to specs, the Xiaomi Redmi 3 and Lenovo Lemon 3 aren't worlds apart, both powered by the Snapdragon 616 processor with 2GB of RAM on board.. Folk that are used to filling up space on their mobile fast will be pleased to hear that both the Redmi 3 and Lemon 3 offer expandable memory via microSD card slots.. Each of these gadgets come equipped with a 13 MP rear camera. with LED flash on the back and a 5 MP camera on the front. The Xiaomi Redmi 3 arrives with a 5-inch HD screen (no, not Full HD) with a 720 x 1,280 resolution, while the Lenovo Lemon 3's Full HD display has a 1,920 x 1,080 resolution. Simply put, the Lemon 3 has a better display.. Xiaomi has plonked a beefy 4,100 mAh battery and 16GB of internal storage inside its budget buy, and the Lenovo Lemon holds the same amount of internal storage but instead rocks a 2,750 mAh battery – that's a significant difference. It'll be interesting to see how a higher-resolution screen and smaller battery size affects the lifespan of the Lemon 3 in comparison with the Redmi 3's. We're looking forward to getting hold of it, and will update this comparison when we do.. For a full comparison between the Xiaomi Redmi 3 and Lenovo Lemon 3, check out the table below.. We're impressed that both of these smartphones have arrived at the price they have. In fact, the Xiaomi Redmi 3 was said to have 'sold out in seconds' when it appeared online overseas earlier in the week.. Both the Xiaomi Redmi 3 and Lenovo Lemon 3 cost 699 Yuan, roughly equivalent to US$106. This means that for just over US$100 you could pick up an Android-powered smartphone with a 5-inch screen, 2GB of RAM and a very respectable pair of cameras. Both these devices are a great deal, there's no denying that.. There is really very little separating these two. They're virtually identical when it comes to cameras, storage and processing power. Personally, we prefer the looks of the Xiaomi Redmi 3 (that eye-catching pattern on the back does it for us) and it's almost certain to offer better battery life, but one of the reasons for that is its lower-resolution screen. If you plan to use a phone for viewing a lot of videos or admiring Instagram pictures, you might find the Lenovo Lemon 3 and its Full HD display more appealing.. With all of this in mind, which of these two smartphones has grabbed your attention more? Are you convinced by the Xiaomi Redmi 3, or does the Lenovo Lemon 3 seem to be ticking more boxes? Let us know in the comments section below.. And what about the bands they support? The comparison isn't useful without knowing what carriers I can use them on.. Do you really think your readers are into these impossible-to-get phones? I don't mind reading about them some, but the English speaking/reading market is not where these phone sell.. Redmi 3 doesn't come with a given corning gorilla glass protector...will that be a real problem? And how can I solve this? Really like this phone.. The think is ppl stil doesnt trust chinesse product even if there triyng to make some of the best smartphone personally for that price ill prefere to go whit a redmi 3 than a samsung grand or prime looks better and im sure it permormance are better. Very much looking forward to a review of these devices. Redmi 3 over a Lenovo phone any day. Redmi 3 has Built in IR Blaster.

more ... more .... more ... more .... The fight for the best affordable phone in Asia: Lenovo Lemon 3 goes official, to rival the Xiaomis of the world. The fight for the best affordable phone in Asia: Lenovo Lemon 3 goes official, to rival the Xiaomis of the world. posted by Victor H.. Tags :. Official - Official + Lenovo - Lenovo +. Great value for the money Now, keep in mind that here we are talking about phones that are officially sold only in China (and in some other Asian countries), but that will most likely not be officially sold in the United States or Europe. Still, it's interesting how such cheap devices push the envelope of what's possible in an affordable phone.. China has become the world's largest phone market in recent years and over there, the competition is intense, especially when it comes to affordable phones. If you start counting Chinese phone makers, you might as well find that there is a brand for every one of the billion people living in the world's most populous country.. It should come as no surprise then, that days after Xiaomi (a company said to be the world's second highest valued start-up after Uber) unveiled its Redmi 3, Lenovo is announcing a rival to the phone in the same price tier: the new Lenovo Lemon 3.. Here is what the Lenovo Lemon 3 is all about: at an official price of just around $106 in China (699 yuan, if you buy it via re-seller expect a double digit price hike), it brings a 5-inch display with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 octa-core system chip under the hood, a 13-megapixel rear cam coupled with a 5-megapixel selfie shooter and a plentiful for its class 16GB of internal storage.. We also consider the presence of Dolby Surround effects as an interesting extra (it's hard to what this really means, but hopefully, it's an indication that Lenovo has taken care to make sound on this affordable phone better than standard). Apart from all this, the phone itself looks sleek, with a fairly non-chubby, 7.99mm thin body.. The only part where it clearly loses the comparison with the Xiaomi Redmi 3 is the battery: while the Xiaomi features a 4,100mAh cell, here you have a 2,750mAh battery.. if you had the hypothetical ability to buy this phone at its low price, would you go for it?. source: Lenovo ( translated ).

The $105 Lemon 3 is Lenovo's answer to the Redmi 3. Earlier this week, Xiaomi unveiled the Redmi 3 , offering stellar hardware for the equivalent of $105. Lenovo has now launched the Lemon 3 , which offers similarly-competitive hardware for the same price. The phone comes with a 5-inch Full HD display, Snapdragon 616 SoC, 2GB of RAM, 16GB storage, 13MP camera, 5MP front shooter, LTE, and a 2750mAh battery.. While Lenovo's latest budget phone offers a higher-resolution display than the Redmi 3, which has a 5-inch 720p display, the latter comes with a massive 4100mAh battery, giving it a battery life of two days at the minimum. No mention as to when either device will be made available outside of China, but it will certainly be interesting to see the kind of effect these phones have on the mid-range segment, considering they're offering similar hardware for a third of the price..
