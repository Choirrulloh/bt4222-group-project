Micromax Canvas Mega 2 review, features and specifications. Canvas Mega 2 is an average offering by MICROMAX in cheap/sub-budget phablet category. This upgraded version of Canvas Mega (launched in December 2015) sports a relatively new quad core Spreadtrum chipset. As compared to the last iteration, the screen size has been increased to 6 inch from 5.5 inch, at the same time display resolution has been reduced to a qHD (960 x 540) one from HD. The lack of pixels should be very noticeable, even for first time users. This might, however, provide some boost to the battery back-up. Primary camera of the phone was stripped down to 8 MP (AF) from 13 MP (AF), while the virtual memory was kept the same as in CANVAS MEGA at 1GB (RAM). Being a budget offering, GPU is very basic so heavy games will be hard to run. The low RAM capacity won’t be helping either. On the other hand phone also comes supporting 4G LTE speeds , video formats such as MP4 , 3GPP , 3GP etc. Handset comes preloaded with a horde of apps such as Amazon Kindle, Ixigo, Ola, Swift Keyboard and Skype. On the whole, Micromax Canvas Mega 2 is targeting first time Android users, who prefer offline channels and extra-large display. If you are open to online shopping, several better options are available in the same price bracket. Loaded with Around UI (Based on Android 5.1 Lollipop), and having an expandable memory to 32GB, you can buy Micromax Canvas Mega 2 online in India for Rs 7,999..

Just upgraded to Premium and downloaded contacts to new android work phone. Want to give my old phone to my Personal Assistant, with the hope that if we both continue to synchronise and update BOTH phones to the account, we will they be able to maintain and update the SAME set of contacts. Really hope so, and if so Phone Copy is even better than expected!. as long as you both sync the phones against the same account, the contacts will be synchronized. The system is also able to handle collisions - changes of the same contact from both phones. You can easily review all changes on PhoneCopy website. As premium user, you can show all changes of each contact (look for the clock icon on contact edit screen).. You can also use our Groups feature which is intended for advanced users and hidden by default (see Settings -> Groups, there is a short help for it). Using that, users are able to assign only part of their data to the other phone (e.g. only business contacts, not the personal ones etc.).

Hi I did a backup from a Sony Ericsson to Phone Copy, now I want to go from the server to the new Trend 7580.Can I do it without wiping the contacts on the Android? In the app I did a combine both, only to find that the server contacts were deleted afterwards! (I did an undelete so at least that worked).

PhoneCopy support team , 02/02/2015. Well, thats what I had tried.In the app it wanted me to go through one of 3 routes-gmail, Sansung or SMS.I don't know if it makes a difference? Another interesting thing was, afterwards using the the old phone I transferred the contacts using bluetooth to the Samsung. It transferred ok but now Gmail on the Samsung can',t see any emails in any of its folders. I'm sure if I delete the Gmail account and reinstall it that a lot of my contacts will disappear again!. the app gives you choices to decide which contact database you want to sync the contacts with.. Samsung is the local contacts (recommended), while Gmail is the contacts storage used by Gmail app and it may interfere with PhoneCopy synchronizations. PhoneCopy support team , 02/02/2015.

Hello, after synchronizing I find phonecopy has imported all the contacts from my gmail account, even those who consist only of an email address (captured automatically by gmail, those which appear under 'Other contacts' in gmail Contacts).. I would like to get rid of those, i.e. sync only the contacts which belong to a 'real' category.. Hello, when you synchronize with some account, all contacts from it will be transfered. In your case it was Google account, which is adding those email addresses as contacts. If you delete them, Google account will create them again. We recommend you to use your (local) phone account instead of Google account for storing your contacts - if it is possible. PhoneCopy support team , 11/12/2014.

I recently "upgraded" to the latest version 2.4.10, but now it takes several minutes instead of less than one minute to sync. It seems to be trying to recreaate every text and contact every time I sync instead of just updating the ones that have changed. This is not really an acceptable performance degradation. The older version worked perfectly, and also told me what contacts/texts were added/deleted, which the latest version doesn't seem to do either. the thing you describe is "slow sync". This type of sync occurs only after login to app, it transfers all contacts and sms from phone and server and merges them. Because it transfers all items it takes a longer time. Next time, after the "slow sync" will be "fast sync" and it transfers only changes from phone or server, therefore it is faster then the previous one.. This behavior is the same as in previous versions of PhoneCopy.. We know that your last five synchronizations were "slow sync". But unfortunately, since you are the first user who this issue reports, currently we don't know the reason. We tested it, but for us it works on all devices.. Please, try to re-login ("Advanced & Account" > "Use existing account" > Select an account you want to sync and then press Login. First time sync will be "slow sync" and another one should be already "fast sync".. If your issue persists or not, please, send us your feedback. PhoneCopy support team , 01/09/2014. I somehow also synced that to phonecopy. So I have lost all contacts. How can I restore them from say.. visit deleted contacts page at https://www.phonecopy.com/en/contact/deleted. All removed contacts are shown, sorted by the time of deletion.. Just select all the contacts you want to restore. You can use the check-box in the upper-left corner of the list to change selection of all displayed contacts, also clicking with Shift or Ctrl works as expected.. Once all contacts are restored, sync your phone and they will be transferred back to the phone. PhoneCopy support team , 25/08/2014.

The problem that occurred was caused by the version PhoneCopy that you are currently using. The actual stable version 2.2.13 is not able to write SMS on phones with Android KitKat (4.4.x / your version is 4.4.2) because new restrictions were added in KitKat that were not in previous versions of Android. We have prepared a new beta version 2.4.9 which is ready for Android KitKat and already fully supports synchronization of SMS.. - from blue link on main screen (above the synchronize button in the PhoneCopy app). - or directly from https://www.phonecopy.com/android/download/PhoneCopy.apk. After install of the beta do relogin in app ("Advanced & Account" > "Use existing account" > Add an account you want to sync and then press Login button). PhoneCopy support team , 21/08/2014.
