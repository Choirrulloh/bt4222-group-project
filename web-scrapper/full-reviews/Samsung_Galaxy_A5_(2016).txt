Have used this whole day no issues apart from the selfie camera which i thought was just not good enough. But when i just changed the setting to full HD from HD it was really amazing. Also if you guys want to buy a classy look phone with good price. You can go for it but let me tell you i am not a heavy gamer so not sure abt that part. The speakers are at the bottom so if your phn is lying on bed then also you would be able to hear the ring easily âº. Was this review helpful? Yes No. By Nobin Babu E | 13 Jul 2016. I have purchased this device 4 months back and now some green line and pink patches appearing on the screen. Service center people has rejected warranty saying its display complaint. Not even a scratch on the screen and they say it user problem. So buy the device as a use and throw basis, they wont give any warranty.. Was this review helpful?

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg)..

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Optical image stabilization, Autofocus, CMOS image sensor. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Octa-core, 1600 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 16.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share, MHL.

GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 02 Dec 2015. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) review: a compelling package. Samsung has confirmed it won't be releasing a Galaxy S6 Mini. Instead, the gap will be filled with an overhauled Galaxy A series. Samsung has released the smaller Galaxy A3, plus a larger model, the A5. review, I’ll be investigating the qualities that might make it your next smartphone purchase. Read on for our full Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) review.. Lowest price: Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016). Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) release date and price. The Galaxy A5 price is around US$399, or 425 euros in Europe (as of January 20), so it sits in quite an affordable price bracket. In terms of its features and size, the Galaxy A5 (2016) is comparable to the likes of the Honor 7 (around US$369) and the Nexus 5X (about US$379). It's a little more expensive than those devices, but not overly expensive by any stretch.. The 32 GB Samsung Galaxy S6, however, now costs only around US$450. It's still Samsung’s main flagship, and superior to Galaxy A5 (2016) in many areas, but only costs minimally more, and it is precisely this minimal difference that could have a negative impact on the sales of the Galaxy A5.. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) design and build quality. This is not the Galaxy S6, but the Galaxy A5 (2016). The A5 has a glass and metal frame.. The buttons at the Galaxy A5 (2016) can be easily reached. The design of the two new A models is very similar. Both the Galaxy A5 (2016) and the A3 (2016) have. the same quality appearance and stylish metal frame as the Galaxy S6.. If just look at only the front and rear of the A5, you might think you actually had an S6 in your hand.. But look closely, and you’ll notice that the glass on the A5 has a rounded 2.5D edge design, which. merges the glass and metal frame almost seamlessly.. After several days of testing, the Galaxy A5 impressed me. The 155 g, 5.2-inch smartphone always felt secure in my hand and the metal frame hasn't started to show any scratches. The Galaxy A5 (2016) feels robust, with Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and back.. The aluminum standby and volume buttons on the side feel nice to the touch and are easy to reach. It's definitely possible to use it one-handed.. In short, the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) is easy to hold and use and just feels like a quality piece of hardware. The fact that the camera protrudes is a slight annoyance, but you could live with it. The Galaxy A5 (2016) is currently available in black, gold and white.. One of the big pluses of the Galaxy A5 (2016): the display. The Galaxy A5 (2016) comes with a 5.2-inch Super AMOLED display, which offers a Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) resolution and rich, deep. Its contrast range is good too.. While the display’s richness benefits gaming, it also means that regular apps look impressive. Texts can also be read easily, thanks to the high contrast it offers.. The A5 (2016) is not overrun with preloaded apps. Everything exactly as you need it.. Samsung has finally started to heed the "less is more". It has purified its software, and the A5 comes with significantly fewer pre-installed apps than some of its other devices. This is a good thing, and right from the start, you'll find the apps that are there add real value to the software experience.. Included are the usual suspects Google, including Maps, YouTube and Google Drive, as well as a good selection of apps from Microsoft, including Excel, Word and Skype.. We were sent a German test model (SM-A510F) running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop (build LMY47X). Like the Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016), TouchWiz is the software interface.. The Touchwiz interface is unquestionably a matter of taste. It has some advantages over stock Android, and. There's nothing in the way of. The Galaxy A5 (2016) does not offer anything that you won't find on another current smartphone.. The processor of the Galaxy A5 (2016) is an old acquaintance, as found in the Galaxy View tablet and Galaxy Tab S2. It's a 1.6 GHz clocked octa-core. Exynos 7580, receiving support from 2 GB RAM and 16 GB of internal memory, which can be expanded via microSD card. The Samsung Galaxy S6 famously does not have a microSD slot.. I performed a range of benchmark tests on the Galaxy A5 (2016), and it ended up mostly in the midfield. In the AnTuTu benchmark (v6.0.1) the Galaxy A5 (2016) scored 40,931, which is almost on par with the Nexus 5X and slightly behind the Honor 7 (around 45,000 points). It doesn’t stand out from the competition, and doesn’t come close to the current top smartphones.. But – and this is probably the deciding factor – no annoying delays or slowdowns were apparent when I was browsing and opening a succession of apps. Even graphically elaborate games ran smoothly across the screen.. The mono speaker is not one for sound fetishists. These settings can be optimized for the headphone sound. The Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) has a mono speaker on the bottom. It plays music well (especially classical) but not brilliantly. The sound is better when listening with headphones.. Also included is a headset that has a button for answer/end call, play/pause and a volume rocker. There’s a software equalizer for the music app that can be found in settings in the Audio options. Here you can improve the sound experience with headphones through the options SoundAlive and tube amplifiers.. If the light is poor, so are the pictures. The camera of the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) is nearly identical to that of the Galaxy A3. Thus, the main camera also has 13 MP in 4:9 format with a f/1.9 aperture. The front camera packs a 5 MP sensor with a f/1.9 aperture. In contrast to the A3, the A5 has an optical image stabilizer, which helps avoid. In dark interiors, it’s hard to get good snapshots from the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016). Only in bright light will you. get nice photos and selfies, so this isn't a suitable phone for photography enthusiasts.. At 2,900 mAh, the battery of the Galaxy A5 (2016) is 600 mAh larger than its predecessor's. The battery can be fully juiced up in about an hour, thanks to the fast-charging feature.. The battery itself can run for quite some time, even under intensive use. In tests, I surfed the internet quite heavily and called up several apps, viewed more than an hour of video and played eight video games.. The integrated energy-saving mode also ensures that you can determine which apps are running in standby. This can save a significant amount of battery.. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) technical specifications. 144.8 x 71 x 7.3 mm. 1920 x 1080 pixels (424 ppi). Its strengths and weaknesses keep the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) on an even scale. Plusses include the A5’s attractive display with crisp, sharp colors and contrast. The battery life is also very good. Even with intensive use, this phone won’t need to see a power source until after about two days. Then there’s the attractive design of and the microSD slot, which the Galaxy S6 doesn’t have.. Where there is light, there is also shade. Above all, camera performance is disappointing, although not as weak as the Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016), and the other minus point is the price.. The Galaxy A5 (2016) is certainly not a perfect smartphone, and certainly not on the level of a. And that is the crux of the matter; currently, the Galaxy S6 is only about US$30 more expensive than the Galaxy A5 (2016), so many customers are likely to go for the S6 over this phone, unless the price of the A5 (2016) drops drastically within the coming weeks.. Samsung gives best design to their smartphones.. + Its best in look, rounded shape, slip piece and just a beautiful look, having no problems to use, it can use easily and have a great processor,It has a good operating system. -The main negative point is its battery life is not good, its not good in response time, take more times when rebooting.. Well tried it and gave up Great looks but heavy. Feels really bulky in the hand it still gets blown away by my Mi4c. Battery wise my iPhone 6 trumps it. Was impressed by last years A5 light thin etc I've put it in the drawer let's see after marshmallow Do hope they do however keep up the 2 seperate trays one for first sim and SD card and a another one for Sim 2 in the duos version Guess this will be the setup on the S7. Strange went on sale here today (SEA) for €360 incl Tax That's the dual sim version with extra sd card slot. (Not hybrid) , so something is driving the price up in other markets that said the S6 is still €500+ Here in the region At that price really a no brainier , I'll pick up one and take it for a spin ... It uses samsungs own CPU not SD !!! So let's see what the difference is. I'm sure the price there will come down quickly. Too expensive for a normal smartphone. I am impressed but some features are not that true. But, why do this looks like an iPhone?. Um the second last paragraph should say A5(2016) not s6 :P s6 IS STILL the flagship. omg galaxy s6 not a flagship phone.....wtf u r doing here u should leave ur job....i m thinking abt deleteing my acount on this site. A5 is just budget phone u cant expect everything prfect. A phone selling for 400€ in Europe is not a budget phone.. You claim that Samsung has officially stated that it would not release an S6 Mini. You cite to another entry on androidpit. That other entry does not cite ANY source of official statement. It only notes that Samsung said, months ago, that "A is the new mini." That is not an official statement. Please see if you can confirm the status of the S6 Mini. Otherwise, it seems like you don't know what you're talking about.. It seems from the review that this phone would last two full days on a charge even with heavy use... This seems strange, given the 2.9A battery and no Marshmallow (yet?). What's the secret? Or is this battery life estimation a bit exaggerated?. MWC 2018 live updates: the Galaxy S9 struts its stuff. * Please enter a valid email address. Almost done!

Samsung Galaxy A5 6 (2016) Review: We’ve fallen hard for the Galaxy A5 6, Samsung’s 2016 reboot of last year’s original Galaxy A5, which supplies a premium mobile experience for just a shade over £300. Is this a Galaxy S7 beater for those on a budget? Here’s our full Galaxy A5 6 (2016) review.. Back in the day, Samsung’s smartphone output used to consist of very good expensive flagship mobiles, and bloody awful affordable handsets. We’re talking cheap plastic, crap cameras, flaky touchscreens; you get the idea. Thankfully times have changes, so while Samsung’s premium devices remain strong, its mid-range and budget blowers are now galaxies (ahem) better.. Last year, Samsung impressed us with the affordable Galaxy A range, consisting of the dinky Galaxy A3 , the Galaxy A5 and the super-sized Galaxy A7. In 2016, the Galaxy A range is being refreshed to bring them up to date. We’ve already reviewed the excellent Galaxy A3 6 and next up is the Galaxy A5 6, a 5.2-inch mobile boasting Full HD visuals, 13-megapixel camera tech, fingerprint security and more.. Read next: Samsung Galaxy A5 2016 vs Galaxy S6, which is best for me?. With a £319 price point, the 2016 edition of the Galaxy A5 could be ideal for anyone after the desirable features of the Galaxy S7 who can’t stomach those steep contract costs. Here’s our in-depth Galaxy A5 6 review.. Like the Galaxy A3 6 before it, the Galaxy A5 6 sports a sleek metal-and-glass design that mimics last year’s Galaxy S6 flagship phone. In fact, the new Galaxy A5 is almost the exact same dimensions and weight as the S6, with a slightly bigger screen adding just a tiny bit of extra height. That means the A5 is quite comfortable to use one-handed, despite that sizeable 5.2-inch display.. Of course, if you want a truly satisfying one-handed experience, check out the Galaxy A3 2016 instead. This 4.7-incher is nice and compact (actually, it’s one of our favourite compact phones of recent times).. You don’t get the perfectly formed curves of the Galaxy S7, nor is the A5 water resistant (so there goes playtime in the bath). However, we still love Samsung’s gorgeous combination of silver metallic edging and glass rear, despite that undeniable sense of deja-vu.. As you’d expect from a Samsung device, the A5’s 5.2-inch screen is bright, sharp and eye-poundingly vibrant. The Full HD resolution keeps images crisp and clear, with individual pixels invisible to the naked eye. On top brightness you’ll have no trouble with sun glare, while the Super AMOLED panel pumps out rich, gorgeous colours that bring images to life.. As with the Galaxy S7, you can set the screen to Samsung’s ‘Adaptive display’ mode, which automatically adjusts the colour range and saturation depending on what you’re up to. And if you’re not a fan of those boosted colours, you can stick the Galaxy A5 on ‘Basic’ mode instead, which warms the colour hue and dials down those rich tones.. The Galaxy A5’s solitary speaker, positioned on the bottom of the device, packs a surprising amount of power. Even with our office Sonos blasting out rock music, the A5 was loud enough for us to make out movie dialogue on top volume. Audio quality isn’t bad either; there’s not much in the way of bass, as you’d expect from a dinky mobile device, but there’s very little distortion and music doesn’t sound too tinny.. You get 16GB of storage space, but only 10GB of this roughly is available for your apps and files. Thankfully there’s a microSD memory card slot, so you can quickly and easily expand.. The Galaxy A5 2016 refresh comes with Android Lollipop 5.1.1 on-board, rather than Google’s latest Android Marshmallow, which means that you miss out on some of the latest Android features .. Of course, stuff like the integrated fingerprint scanner support isn’t needed anyway; Samsung has done a solid job of supporting the Galaxy A5’s fingerprint sensor all on its own. That scanner, built into the A5’s home button beneath the screen, takes very little time to set up and yet is impressively accurate. You can press your chosen digit to the sensor at almost any angle, and it will be recognised first time pretty much every single time.. It isn’t the fastest scanner around, of course. That bragging right goes to the excellent HTC 10. But you’ll still be into your desktops in under a second, which is plenty fast.. Samsung’s Touchwiz interface will be immediately familiar to any fans and previous owners, adding a touch of colour to Android as well as Flipboard support (which can thankfully be deactivated at will). You can also expect a ton of Samsung services, such as the S Health exercise tracker and a link to Samsung’s own online apps store.. We’ve got nothing against S Health and the rest, but Samsung has annoyingly added its own browser, email client and other bits to the Google apps line-up, which means lots of duplication. And of course, there’s no way to delete them. Still, at least Samsung has added in some nifty shortcuts, such as the ability to hang up a call by turning your phone screen-down or open the camera by double-tapping the home button. You also get access to Samsung’s Knox security software, to keep your privates super-safe with extra encryption.. The new Galaxy A5 packs a Snapdragon 615 processor, along with 2GB of RAM. The 615 chipset can be found on loads of mid-range handsets from the past year, including Motorola’s most recent Moto G, where it’s proved highly dependable. Of course, Samsung’s heavy Touchwiz overlay is something that the Moto G doesn’t have to contend with.. Read next: Moto G re-review after one year. So far, the Galaxy A5 has thankfully given us a smooth and satisfying experience. You can multi-task with two apps side-by-side and there’s still no sign of a stutter, while the latest fast-paced games run with a solid and dependable frame rate. Of course, whether the A5 can keep up this level of performance remains to be seen; check back later for our long-term Galaxy A5 2016 review to see.. The Galaxy A3 blew us away with its amazing battery life, giving us two days of use before finally biting the dust. Good news is, the Galaxy A5 is just as impressive. We once again regularly enjoyed 48 hours of life between charges, even with plenty of web browsing, messaging, camera shots and the rest. And if you choose to stream video non-stop, you’ll still get an excellent ten hours of life before the A5 is drained.. Amusingly, the Galaxy A5 actually has a ‘better’ camera on paper than the premium Galaxy S7, with a 13-megapixel snapper versus the flagship’s 12-megapixel camera. Of course, there’s much more to a camera’s quality than simple numbers, and of course the A5’s camera isn’t quite as outstanding as the S7’s.. However, it is a very good mid-range shooter, and highly dependable on full auto mode. We took dozens of snaps in all kinds of lighting conditions and the results speak for themselves – check out our in-depth Samsung Galaxy A5 camera review for full photo and video samples, and our personal impressions.. The Samsung Galaxy A5 6 is a brilliant refresh of an already solid smartphone, and one of the best £300 mobiles you’ll find (alongside greats such as the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact and Motorola Moto X Force). Dependable performance, solid battery life and great features like the excellent dual cameras and fingerprint sensor make it an essential purchase for those who desire flagship quality, but can’t afford those premium price tags..

Samsung's Galaxy A-series smartphones are the next best to its flagship Galaxy S lineup. This series is meant for those who want a premium Samsung phone without the bloated price tag. Of course, these devices come devoid of some of the bells and whistles of the uber-premium S-series but you'll find most of the essential flagship-class features. Our review of the Samsung Galaxy A8 last August is testament to a formula that is working for Samsung.. Towards the tail end of last year, Samsung refreshed this series with a new Galaxy A7 , Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A3 ; all ready to make their 2016 debut. After our initial impressions of the A5 and A7 (which are now available in India), it's time to take a closer look at the new 2016 Galaxy A5 and see how good it really is.. Look and feel As you've probably already gathered from Samsung's TV commercials, the Galaxy A5's biggest trump card is its metal-and-glass construction. To put it simply, the phone feels every bit as premium as the Galaxy S6, from which it borrows some design cues. This time, there's curved Gorilla Glass 4 for the front and the back of the device, which makes it look and feel a lot classier than its predecessor.. In the front, we have a 5.2-inch full-HD Super Amoled display that delivers vibrant colours and excellent sunlight legibility. The colours tend to get oversaturated in Adaptive Mode, which can cause a bit of eye fatigue after a while. This can be remedied by switching to another display mode. The A5's display also has very thin borders which gives it an edge-to-edge look.. Navigation buttons are where you'd expect them on a Samsung phone and a fingerprint sensor is integrated into the Home button. Oddly, there's no notification LED for incoming alerts. The headphones socket, Micro-USB port, and speaker grille are all placed at the bottom.. The A5 launched in India (codename A510FD) is a true dual-SIM phone, and you get a dedicated slot for a microSD card. The tray on the right houses the primary SIM and storage expansion while a separate tray on the top of the phone is for the secondary SIM.. Samsung bundles a 10W charger, data cable, headset, and SIM ejector tool in the Galaxy A5 retail package - only our review unit was missing the latter two. Samsung has done an exceptional job with the construction of the new phone, making it look and feel as good as the flagship Galaxy S6. The glass on the back does make the phone a bit slippery to hold and we wish there had been a notification LED.. Specifications and software With the cosmetic refreshes also come performance upgrades. The Galaxy A5 (2016) sold in India features Samsung's octa-core Exynos 7580 SoC, which we found a little puzzling because it's the same SoC that powers the lower mid-range Galaxy J7. Some modifications have been made, as the SoC in the A5 runs at a slightly higher 1.6GHz and supports faster Category 6 LTE.. Despite its older 28nm fabrication, it's still a very capable SoC and offers similar performance to the Snapdragon 615. We managed to get 41,907 points in AnTuTu and 13fps in GFXbench. The GPU score was a bit lower when compared to the Adreno GPU in the 615 SoC.. The rest of the specifications include 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage which can be expanded up to 128GB, dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC, FM radio, and USB OTG. The A5 supports 4G on both SIM slots, however there's no support for VoLTE yet.. It's a little disappointing to see the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) ship with Android Lollipop but we guess Samsung was saving its Marshmallow debut for the Galaxy S7. The phone runs TouchWiz, which has gotten slicker over the years but continues to stay true to its colourful roots.. Samsung throws in some of its own apps such as S Health, S Voice, and My Galaxy. There's also the Ultra Data Saving mode found in the J-series, powered by Opera Max. This helps compress Internet data so you don't end up exhausting your monthly data pack too soon. MixRadio is also present but you won't be able to use it for too long as the service is shutting down. You get a USB Backup app which lets you back up data to an OTG pen drive. Samsung also bundles several of Google's and Microsoft's popular apps.. Most of the stock apps and some third-party ones support split-screen view. This can be activated by tapping the Recents button for a few seconds when in a supported app.. Performance Despite the all-encompassing UI skin, general performance is quite good. A slight hiccup is noticeable if you have a lot of apps open in the background, but other than this, we didn't face any issues. The phone warms up during gameplay or extensive camera use but runs fairly cool for pretty much everything else. We also didn't have any issues with call quality or latching onto 4G networks with a SIM in either slot. The A5 can handle most apps with ease and doesn't break a sweat while gaming either.. The fingerprint sensor works but isn't as quick or accurate as the ones we've used on some other recent phones. You'll need to have your thumb or finger cover the entire button for it to recognise a pattern. Out of the 16GB of storage, you have around 11GB of actual usable space. It's not a big problem since you can add more storage.. The A5 is a good phone for multimedia playback thanks to its vibrant display. Even standard-definition movies look crisp with saturated colours. Full-HD videos, including high-bitrate files play just fine too. Sound is fairly loud through the mono speaker. The audio player is very feature-rich, with plenty of settings for tweaking the audio quality.. The primary camera features a 13-megapixel sensor with a decently large f/1.9 aperture and optical image stabilisation. Due to this, the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) is able to capture pretty detailed landscapes and macros in daylight. Colour reproduction is also quite good, although things do tend to look exaggerated on the phone's display. Pictures taken under artificial light and in low light exhibit slight graininess when zoomed in but overall, camera quality is pretty good.. Videos are also crisp at full-HD resolution. The 5-megapixel front camera boasts of an f/1.9 aperture so you can get detailed selfies even indoors. The camera is quick to capture and save images but focusing speed is quite poor. This is also a big issue with video recording: the sensor refuses to adjust focus when panning unless you tap the screen. The lack of phase detection autofocus is very evident here.. The camera app is a watered-down version of the one seen in Samsung's flagships and isn't implemented as well. For instance, burst mode is now one of the shooting modes, and needs to be selected separately as it doesn't work in Auto mode. There aren't any shooting modes for video; all you can do is change the resolution. There's no shortcut to toggle HDR from the viewfinder as that's a separate shooting mode too. This rearrangement of options makes using the app unnecessarily tedious in our opinion.. Battery life The new 2016 Galaxy A5 crams in a larger 2900mAh battery compared to the outgoing model. This has bumped up the thickness and weight of the phone by a bit, but that really shouldn't matter as the phone ran for 14 hours and 42 minutes in our battery loop test, which is very good. With regular use, we easily managed to go a day and a half before needing to recharge it. The phone also supports Adaptive Quick Charging and we were able to go from zero to a little more than 50 percent in just half an hour.. Verdict Samsung has done a commendable job with the new Galaxy A5, which is a marked improvement over its predecessor and brings the Galaxy A-series a step closer to the beauty and finesse of the Galaxy S-series. However, the company has gotten the pricing completely wrong which makes it impossible to recommend this phone at the moment. The 2016 Galaxy A5 retails for roughly Rs. 28,500 which is too expensive when you consider the overall package. Even the new Galaxy A7 for that matter suffers the same fate, since it's virtually identical to the A5 apart from having a larger screen, better battery, a bit more RAM, and a higher price tag. The Galaxy S6 ( Review ) is a no-brainer at roughly Rs. 33,000 and this price might even fall further with the launch of the Galaxy S7 series.. The new Galaxy A5 has a shot at success if Samsung corrects its price quickly. 20,000 would be the sweet spot considering the specifications and features this phone offers, and the competition it has to face. The Galaxy A5 excels in terms of build and aesthetics, packs an excellent display, and offers very good battery life. We quite liked the quality of pictures it takes too, although the camera app could have been designed better. We also don't understand the reasoning behind ditching the notification LED.. To sum up, Samsung's 2016 Galaxy A5 refresh will make a good buy once the price comes down to lower levels. If you can't wait, just grab the Galaxy S6 instead..

Home / News / Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) review: great design, display, battery, mediocre camera. Pros Cons Great design No Android Marshmallow yet Very nice display No notification LED Solid. battery performance Mediocre camera Useful features. So here it is: Samsung’s revamped Galaxy A5 (2016). With its premium design and build quality, practical features, and impressive battery life, this is one of the most interesting Galaxy phones this year. And we say that knowing full well the Galaxy S7. We’ve been using the device for several weeks now, so it’s time we shared our experiences in the following review.. Note: This review is based on our experiences with. both the European model SM-A510F, and the Chinese dual sim model SM-A5100. We’ve used the latter without Google Play Services and with, after flashing the device’s Hong Kong firmware .. If you’ve read our Galaxy A3 and A5 (2016) preview , you know the Galaxy S6 ‘ design language can be found all over the phone. Still, there are some notable differences. The aluminium frame and the corners are all just a little less round, giving the phone a. The Gorilla Glass 4 that covers the front and back of the device has a clearly. The display seems to float on top of the Galaxy A5 (2016), which makes for a very nice visual touch. In fact, we think this is the prettiest non-edge device. that Samsung has built to date, even if fingerprints are as attracted to the glass as ever.. When holding the A5 (2016), the weight gain caused by a bigger battery in a thicker body adds significantly to the feeling of quality, for example when compared to the A5 from 2014. The camera protrudes a little from the back, though less than on the Galaxy S6, and likely reveals what the. upcoming S7’s bump will be like.. Overall, the phone leaves an impression befitting a high-end device, in terms of look and feel.. The 5.2-inch Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy A5 (2016) packs a 1920 x 1080 pixel. resolution, which is noticeably sharper than that of its predecessor (424 versus 294 pixels per inch) while not overdoing it with an even higher S6-like QHD pixel count. For most users a 1080p resolution. sweet spot where image quality, performance and battery life are in balance. In fact, unless you plan to dabble in virtual reality with the Gear VR , this is about as high a resolution as you’ll ever need.. Equally notable is the improvement in color reproduction. While the Galaxy A5 (2016) does not provide the near-perfect reproduction of the S6 and Note 5, the phone’s AMOLED-photo or basic modes provide. a calm, relatively natural looking display. As a rough comparison, think of the Galaxy S5’s Full HD AMOLED. We think the new A5’s is far better.. Needless to say, contrast is as usual with this type of AMOLED display, that is to say: perfect. In auto mode, the display can get pretty bright, to ensure good visibility even in sunlight.. though, again, not as good as on Samsung’s top of the range devices, and whites are a little bit on the warmer side of the spectrum.. Still, for the Galaxy A5 (2016)’s class this is a very nice, sharp display with all the benefits of Samsung’s current generation AMOLED technology.. The Galaxy A5 (2016) packs Samsung’s Exynos 7580 system-on-a-chip also found in the Galaxy S5 Neo. It’s hardly a beast, but still sufficient to drive the latest version of the TouchWiz interface without hiccups. Even heavier games can be played. decently, but when several tasks are running in the background, for example when installing or updating apps, the fact that this is a mid-range device with a mid-range processor does become evident.. Of course, Samsung did not equip the A5 (2016) with its scorching UFS 2.0 flash storage, nor is its two gigabytes. of RAM of the DDR4 variety. Don’t expect large amounts of data to flow quickly, as these are tried. tested, but not exceptionally performing parts.. Despite its very classy looks and above average display, performance-wise the new A5 really is a mid-range smartphone that stays true to its. On the software front, as mentioned, TouchWiz on the new Galaxy A5 (2016) runs fine, if not in record-breaking fashion. For those unfamiliar with the improvements added to the interface in recent times, buttons have text instead of only. and menus have been significantly simplified, so there won’t be any confusion as to what each option does.. Perhaps the best recent improvement to TouchWiz is the theme store, with which the new A5 comes out of the box. There are even a few simple but good looking themes exclusive to the Galaxy A (2016) series , but it is the general. possibility to customize the looks of the interface that make this by far the best recent TouchWiz feature.. All of this, however, can not hide the fact that Android version 5.1.1 Lollipop hasn’t been the latest and greatest since quite a few months now. It is not bad per se, and having Android Marshmallow would not instantly improve the Galaxy A5 (2016) significantly, but this is simply a point of discussion that could and should have been avoided in the first place.. Last year it took Samsung several months to bring Android Lollipop to its first generation of A devices, despite it being readily available from Google at the time of launch. A similar unnecessary wait for the update to Marshmallow lies ahead for anyone who buys the Galaxy A5 (2016), or any other Galaxy A revamp, right now.. While we’re busy pointing out some of the Galaxy A5 (2016)’s downsides, we might as well move on to the main camera. The 13-megapixel sensor on the back actually comes with an f/1.9 aperture and optical image stabilization (OIS) – features it shares with the Galaxy S6 – so we had good hopes for the quality of the images. Actual results were, in the light of this, underwhelming.. As with most other mid-range smartphones, the camera performs well in broad daylight,. Dynamic range, however, seems quite limited in automatic mode. HDR mode, but it is slow, and there is no real-time preview that shows how such a shot will turn out. Also, the maximum resolution is limited to eight megapixels when shooting HDR images. We tried to come up with reasons why this would be, but find it hard to believe there could be technical restrictions (processing power, RAM). The presence of OIS generally seems helpful in the phone’s night and HDR modes, keeping the lens steady enough to achieve satisfying results. Still, it is a far cry from the sharpness the S6′ stabilized lens. achieves in various circumstances and modes.. Check out some sample images taking in the camera’s auto mode:. And now the same images taken in HDR (rich tone) mode:. The camera’s ‘professional’ mode is fairly basic. It offers manual control over white balance, exposure and ISO values from 100 upwards, but no shutter speed setting, nor. the ability to save RAW data. Fortunately, the camera app can be started by pressing the home button twice, which is a simple and very useful feature.. Just a few more random samples:. 1080p recording at 30 frames per second. There’s no HDR here, so dynamic range is limited, while. autofocus isn’t very slow but occasionally needs to time catch up. Forget 60 fps or 4K – those options didn’t make it to Samsung’s A series. The A5 (2016)’s front shooter is sufficient for all possible, wide-angled selfie requirements, and effective in. conditions with not so much light. Resolution, however, is limited to five megapixels. there’s no HDR mode available for it.. Still, for most users who mainly use their phones to take. pictures they can share through social media or messaging apps, the Galaxy A5 (2016)’s camera will prove adequate. And the five megapixel front shooter is capable of producing decent selfies even in low-light conditions. Lovers of high-quality smartphone photography should,. Notwithstanding Android Lollipop and the camera, there is another area besides design and display where the Galaxy A5 (2016) leaves a very positive impression.. In terms of battery life, the 2900 mAh battery combines brilliantly with the device’s modest processor and display resolution. took us genuine effort to drain its juices within one working day. Without any additional gaming added on top of regular use, the A5 (2016) lasted two days with relative ease.. Samsung, as far as we are concerned, is on the right track sacrificing thinness for battery life in the new Galaxy A (2016) series. Needless to say this is a very smart, and necessary, move. particularly after last year’s Galaxy S6 left many disappointed in. To make things even better, Samsung decided to. equip the new A5 with the fast charging feature, previously only found on more expensive Galaxy devices. You can charge it from zero to full in a little over one and a half hours. Or fill it up halfway in about 30 minutes.. Long-lasting battery life and fast charging are two very practical features that add. real value to the Galaxy A5 (2016). They are, however, not the only ones.. The Galaxy A5 (2016) packs the same fast and smooth working fingerprint scanner found in the Galaxy S6 and Note 5. It is simple and fast, and adds safety to different features, from the. lock screen to Samsung Pay (if available in your country).. It is very nice to see a premium looking mid-range device packing such a good fingerprint scanner. Pressure from other manufacturers made Samsung think long and hard about how to keep its devices competitive. Adding useful features seems a sensible answer to the problem.. features, the Galaxy A5 (2016) comes with a few tricks even Samsung’s high-end phones in 2015 forgot how to do. There is space for a microSD card, and you can listen to some old-fashioned FM radio – the type of radio that does not devour. Here’s both the single SIM tray (left, SM-A510F), and the dual SIM tray (right, SM-A5100):. On our Chinese A5 (2016) the microSD slot doubles as a second SIM slot. This is an efficient solution, though it’s a pity users of two SIM cards have to sacrifice expandable storage. Though a comparable dual SIM model. outside of China, the standard European A5 (2016), for example,. has a microSD slot without extra functionality.. Last but not least, it is necessary to mention the A5 (2016)’s notification LED. Or to be precise: the curious lack thereof. Sure, there are other ways to get notified of missed calls or messages , but this is just one of those peculiar Samsung design choices that are hard to understand.. Taking a step back to once more look at the full picture, the Galaxy A5 (2016) is actually a very sensible device. It packs the right mix of components into a well-designed body, turning it into a feature-rich phone with solid battery performance. However, if you require a top-notch camera, a quick dose. of Marshmallow, or a notification LED, the Galaxy A5 (2016) does fall short.. for most average smartphone users, the A5 (2016) will mainly stand out as a device with a premium look and feel, a very nice display, sufficient performance and solid two-day. with its mid-range price tag, and the new A5 just might be. the Samsung device that gives the most bang-per-buck this year.. Of course, Samsung’s most prolific phones of 2016 still have to come out: the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. even though it looks as if they pack comparable battery life , a superior camera , a higher resolution display, and some additional water and dust protection , the difference in pricing will be significant.. Except for users who need a top-notch camera, or the possibility to use their device with the Gear VR, the A5 (2016) packs specs that. will satisfy all but the most demanding smartphone users.. Reviews Galaxy A5 (2016) SM-A510 SM-A5100 SM-A510F. Specs comparison: Galaxy A5 (2016) vs Galaxy A8 (2018). Er, surprise? Galaxy A5 (2016) is first to get December security patch.

Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) Smartphone Review. Andreas Osthoff ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 03/01/2016. ARM Android Smartphone Touchscreen. Just one year after the first Galaxy A5 generation, Samsung introduces the successor. Updates are found in screen, wireless module as well as the SoC.

Samsung's newest Galaxy A5 (2016) is a consistent further development of the. on design with its casing composed of aluminum and glass. The battery still cannot be removed, but the storage capacity can be expanded via micro-SD card. The buyer again gets solid mid-range components alongside an Exynos octa-core SoC, Super-AMOLED screen in Full HD resolution and a fingerprint scanner in total. 100 Euros, ~$108, cheaper) that we had in. Starting at an official retail price of 429 Euros (~$466), the latest Galaxy A5 finds many opponents. as comparison devices for this test. strong rivals: In addition to the aforementioned Galaxy S5 Neo, the price of the former top-model. has dropped considerably and is now not much more expensive than the Galaxy A5..

This time, glass is also used on. However, that makes it feel very sleek and sometimes even a bit slippery. The camera only juts out of the back marginally and is therefore not annoying in everyday use. The aluminum bezel is slightly beveled at the edges. The design is overall very appealing, but the sleek, glass back makes handling a bit awkward. The keys are incorporated very accurately, but the Home button produces a relatively loud clicking noise. The Galaxy A5 (2016) is available in black, gold and pink-gold in addition to our white review sample.. The stiffness of the unibody casing is very good. We only heard very quiet cracking noises during very energetic warping attempts. Pressure on the screen is not at all a problem. In total, the entire build can be called impeccable.. Compared with the predecessor, this year's A5 is a bit taller (6.7 vs. It is still pleasant to hold with a weight of 155 grams. The devices in the comparison are all on a very similar level. bulkier with its bigger 5.5-inch display. The battery cannot be removed due to the casing's construction.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. octa-core SoC operates with eight cores, and 2 GB of working memory supports it. The user can initially use 10.8 GB, but 1 GB is additionally deducted from that after updating the preloaded apps. The storage can be expanded by up to 128 GB via a micro-SD card. Compatible apps can be moved to the memory card after their installation. A micro-USB 2.0 port for charging and data sharing with a PC is situated on the lower edge; it also supports USB-OTG for external peripherals, but not MHL. Supported transfer standards are Wi-Fi Direct and ANT besides NFC and Bluetooth 4.1. An FM radio that can be used in conjunction with headphones is also integrated.. The fingerprint scanner is incorporated into the Home button. The finger has to be placed on the sensor 10 - 15 times for setting it up. It functions very reliably and conveniently since swiping is not necessary. However, the sensors in the rivals are now faster. The fingerprint can also be used for logging in on websites and making payments via the Samsung account (e.g. in Samsung's own apps store) after unlocking the screen. The fingerprint cannot yet be used for shopping in Google's Play Store.. Lower edge: 3.5 mm audio, micro-USB 2.0, speaker, microphone. Right: Nano-SIM & micro-SD combo slot, power button. The Galaxy A5 is shipped with Android 5.1.1 that Samsung covers with its proprietary user interface TouchWiz. It is not yet known whether or when an update to the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow will be released. Currently, only update information for the premium devices of the S and Note lineups are available, but not for the A models. The software does not present us with any big surprises. It is easy to use and offers some useful extra features, such as the news feed "Briefing" when swiping the home screen left. We also find the well-known extras like the proprietary app store "Galaxy Apps", "Smart Manager" and some Microsoft apps. The fitness tool "S-Health" that records daily activities via the integrated pedometer is also on-board.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

Galaxy S5 Neo , the Galaxy A5 supports the high-speed LTE Cat. 6 standard for transmission rates of up to 300 Mbit/s. downstream (50 Mbit/s upstream) - at least when the provider supports these speeds. A version with dual-SIM support is available in some parts of the world. Only one SIM card can be inserted in the European A-510F model. All frequencies are listed in the specifications at the beginning of this article. The review sample is not quite as modern in local network connectivity. It does not support the high-speed 802.1ac standard. At least, both the 2.4 and 5 GHz networks can be used. We did not have any reception issues in either the urban German Telecom network or in the private Wi-Fi network at home during the test.. The European smartphone model can be localized via GPS and the Russian GLONASS systems. Tracking was already possible near a window indoors with a relatively good accuracy of 8 meters. The accuracy does not improve outdoors. Interestingly, the GPS signal decreases gradually until it is completely lost when a finger is placed on the smartphone's upper right.. We additionally check the tracking accuracy on a bike trip and compare the outcomes with the Garmin Edge 500 navigation system. Although the navigation system does not always track the route perfectly, the review sample takes bigger shortcuts since the position is not determined as frequently. The total deviation is only approximately 150 meters on our test route, thus there should not be any restrictions when navigating in a car.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

The phone app is known from other Samsung devices and should not be an unsolvable riddle for anyone. Phone numbers can be entered either via the large keypad or simply by opening the contact. It is also possible to set up call forwarding or block specified numbers in the settings.. We criticized the middling call quality in the test of the. predecessor ; in particular the microphone did not make a good. We were therefore curious whether the latest Galaxy A5 does a better job. The speaker still renders voices with some distortion, but our contact always understood us well. We did not observe static or other interruptions during calls.. At first glance, the camera equipment seems unchanged compared with the. Samsung still installs a 13 MP. sensor on the rear and a 5 MP lens on the front. However, a bigger aperture is now used in both modules (rear: f/1.9 vs. 2.2), which is to create brighter photos. That is particularly noticed with the front camera. A lot can still be recognized even in low residual light despite the lack of a flash, even if that inevitably leads to image noise. The details also suffer under the low resolution, as can be seen in our comparison screenshot taken with the rear camera. Videos can be recorded in Full HD (1920x1080 pixels). In total, the performance is sufficient for selfies.. The camera app is very clearly arranged and easy to use. It offers common features, such as a professional mode and panorama mode, but it does not offer time lapse. Double clicking the home button directly opens the camera from standby, and the volume control keys serve as the release. The auto-focus has room for improvement: Unlike other smartphones, it needs quite some time and thus makes a somewhat sluggish impression.. Compared with other smartphones, it is immediately noticed that the rear-facing 13 MP camera shoots relatively dark photos. Some small details are absorbed already in scene 1, although the outcome is acceptable seen on its own. It is more drastic in scene 2 where many details of the surroundings cannot be recognized at all. The object is still illuminated properly in the low-light scene (scene 3), and many details are visible. However, the image noise is more prominent than in the rivals. The video-recording settings are limited to resolution, where the user can select Full HD, HD or VGA. The frame rate frequency is limited to 30 FPS and slow motion is not supported. The sensor copes well with quick panning, and the shots can also be paused.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. In addition to our standard test, we also examined the color accuracy and sharpness under controlled test conditions. The photos are shot in automatic mode, and it is not edited afterwards. The white balance is not manipulated, either.. We use X-Rite's ColorChecker Passport for the test. The original color is displayed in the lower part of each color. Some colors of the Galaxy A5 are somewhat paler, but the deviations are overall within limits.. We assess the image sharpness based on a photo of our test chart. The 100% image section is from the center and is relatively sharp thanks to the decent resolution. Lightly frayed outlines are only seen at the edges. We could see this minor fuzziness in the entire chart.. Original colors are displayed in the lower half of every patch.. The box of Samsung's Galaxy A5 contains a modular power supply (10 watts), a USB cable, a headset and the usual brochures. Samsung optionally offers diverse accessories on its homepage, such as generic items like headphones or external batteries, as well as special covers for the A5.. A warranty period of 24 months is included.. Samsung's keyboard is enabled by default. An additional number bar is above the normal letters. It is a bit narrower than the latter. The keyboard also supports all common features, such as word suggestions, spelling correction and swiping that first has to be enabled in the settings. The touchscreen offers very good gliding qualities, and inputs are implemented reliably even at the edges. Galaxy S5 Neo , handling was sometimes. accompanied with occasional lags or glitches. The touchscreen is also very sensitive, which occasionally resulted in incorrect inputs.. Samsung has improved the Galaxy A5's screen compared to. A Super-AMOLED panel is again installed, but its. resolution has been increased to 1920x1080 pixels. That leads to a pixel density of 424 PPI alongside the somewhat larger diagonal of 5.2-inches, which ensures extremely sharp images.. The screen also scores very decently in the brightness measurements. While the screen's average brightness on a pure white image is almost 380 cd/mÂ², it climbs to a maximum of 472 cd/mÂ² when bright and dark content is distributed evenly (APL50). Even a tremendously high 681 cd/mÂ² is possible when the light sensor is enabled. Since the inherent design leads to a black level of 0 cd/mÂ², the contrast ratio is also extremely high. In total, the Galaxy A5 outshines the AMOLED rivals with these rates, and can even compete with the best LC displays in terms of brightness. The minimum brightness is only 1.79 cd/mÂ², which allows using the smartphone very comfortably even in dark environments.. 396 cd/m² 372 cd/m² 361 cd/m² 394 cd/m² 378 cd/m² 368 cd/m² 397 cd/m² 378 cd/m² 373 cd/m². 91 % Center on Battery: 378. cd/m²) ΔE Color 1.95 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 1.86 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.13.

As common for Super-AMOLEDs, the user can select among different color profiles. The smartphone automatically adapts to content by default, but the profiles Basic, Cinema (higher saturation) and Photo (realistic reproduction) are also available. In delivery state, the average DeltaE 2000 shifts are a very good 1.95 in colors and 1.86 in the grayscale levels compared with the sRGB color space. The target rate is less than 3 in both cases, and thus the human eye will not detect any color shifts. That makes the Galaxy A5 one of the best devices also in the comparison field..

This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM detected 240.4 Hz. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. The display backlight flickers at 240.4. Hz is relatively low, so sensitive users will likely notice flickering and experience eyestrain at the stated brightness setting and below.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. Thanks to the tremendous brightness (with enabled brightness sensor) and extremely high contrast ratio, the content displayed on the Galaxy A5 remains easily legible even in bright surroundings. We could not make a photo in direct sunlight due to weather conditions, but that should not be a problem. That is, of course, providing reflections on the glare-type screen are avoided, as is the case in virtually every mobile device. The right description for the viewing-angle stability is also excellent: minor color shifts (greenish tint) are only seen in extreme positions. That will not restrict everyday use, though.. The SoC in Samsung's Galaxy A5 is the. As the name suggests, it has eight Cortex A53 cores that achieve a. The processor is a member of the lower mid-range in terms of performance and thus it has a hard time in this comparison. That is all the more true for the. with a performance even lower than Qualcomm's. We find the expected results in the benchmarks. Our review sample is usually in one of the last places and competes with the technically very identical. Both Samsung devices are clearly behind the rivals. particularly in the graphically demanding Sling Shot benchmark (ES 3.0). In total, the Galaxy A5, Galaxy S5 Neo,.

The 16 GB eMMC storage is likely the same model as in the Galaxy S5 Neo since the benchmark scores are virtually identical. Almost 210 MB/s in sequential read and 60 MB/s in sequential write place the Galaxy A5 in the midfield. That should not restrict everyday use.. We also test the card reader's performance with our Toshiba Exceria SD-CX32UHSI (32 GB) reference card. The rates are a very good 80 MB/s (read) and 40 MB/s (write).

Thus, the smartphone can be placed on a table without needing to fear a muffled sound. The sound is overall tinny and bass is absolutely non-existent. At least only minor distortions are heard in high volumes. The maximum volume of almost 88 dB(A) is also sufficiently high.

In review: Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016). Review sample courtesy of Samsung Germany.. Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2016) proves to be a successful advancement of the predecessor in most sectors. The mid-range smartphone is again very elegant and, apart from PWM flickering, it has one of the best panels in this segment. The cameras have also been improved slightly. Further plus points are the low emissions and long battery life.. We would have wished for ac Wi-Fi, and the casing is quite slippery due to its glass back, which lessens the good overall impression to a small extent. However, the biggest issue is - like in the predecessor - the performance. At an RRP of 429 Euros (~$466), we would have hoped for a bit more power. The Galaxy A5 not only falls behind its opponents in the benchmarks, but small lags and glitches are also noticed time and again in everyday use. Whether or not the mid-range models from the A lineup will be updated to Android 6.0 is not yet known, either.. Samsung again provides a very high-quality as well as very pricey mid-range smartphone with its new Galaxy A5. The screen belongs to the best of its kind, but it lags behind its rivals in performance.. Samsung Galaxy A5 2016 - 2016-02-26 02/26/2016 v5 Andreas Osthoff.

Author Srivatsan Sridhar Posted on March 5, 2016 March 8, 2016 Categories India , Reviews , Samsung. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) smartphone in Golden color. 2-pin fast charger (9V-1.67A / 5V-2A). Quick start guide and user manual. Samsung launched the Galaxy A5 (2016) , after more than a year of launching its first Galaxy A5 smartphone in its ‘A series’ in India. On paper, specifications of the new A5 smartphone are way better than its predecessor. Even the new A5 is priced at Rs. 29,400, more than launch price of the first A5. Is the Galaxy A5 (2016) worth the price? Let us find out in the complete review. We unboxed the smartphone recently, check out the unboxing video below.. The Galaxy A5 2016 has a 5.2-inch Super AMOLED display with a pixel resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and a pixel density of around 423 PPI. The display is bright, has good viewing angles, offers vibrant color output and the sunlight visibility is also good. Blacks are perfectly black, thanks to the AMOLED panel. The display sharp compared to first-gen A5’s screen, since the pixel density is more. It has 2.5D curved Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection on the front. The display is prone to smudges, but it is not glossy. Since the display is curved, it is very smooth and slips out easily.. On the top there is a 5-megapixel camera with f/1.9 aperture has wide-selfie that captures 120-degree wide panorama to accommodate more people and beautification features. Images from the front camera is bright and sharp with good details. It has the usual set of proximity and ambient light sensors next to the earpiece, but the smartphone lacks notification LED that is present on most mid-range smartphones.. There is Samsung’s signature home button below the display that has a metal finish around it. Samsung has introduced fingerprint sensor in the ‘A series’ for the first time, which is embedded into the home button. We will discuss about the sensor later. The capacitive touch buttons for menu and back are present on both the sides. These are backlit and offer haptic feedback when pressed.. It has a metal frame and is just 7.3mm thick. The volume rockers are present on the left side of the smartphone.. The power button is present on the right side, along with a slot of primary SIM card and microSD. The 3.5mm audio jack, micro USB slot, loudspeaker grill and the primary microphone are present on the bottom, while the secondary microphone and the secondary SIM slot are present on the top.. Samsung has finally introduced dedicated SIM slots in the second-generation ‘A series’ instead of hybrid SIM support in the first ‘A series’ phones. You need to use the bundled SIM ejector tool to remove the slot on the right side that has a single tray with support for microSD card (up to 128GB) and a nano SIM slot.. The secondary SIM slot on the top also accepts nano SIM cards. The back also has Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection, but it is prone to fingerprints and is also slippery. Samsung should have provided a clear cover with the phone. It has a screen-to-body ratio of 72.5%, slightly better than the first A5. At 144.8mm, it looks a bit tall, but it is easy to hold since it is 71mm wide. On the back there is a 13-megapixel camera with a single LED flash. It has a built-in 2900mAh battery, so it is slightly heavier at 155 grams. Overall, the phone has a good design and a solid build quality.. It packs a 13-megapixel auto focus rear camera with f/1.9 aperture, single LED flash, Optical Image Stabilization (OIS). The camera UI is similar to other Samsung smartphones running Android Lollipop. It has several modes (Auto, Pro (lets you adjust white balance, ISO and exposure manually), Panorama, Continuous shot, HDR, Night), Effects (Posterise, Grey-scale, Sepia, Negative), Voice control, and timer ( 2, 5 or 10 seconds). You can also press the home button twice to launch the camera, even when the screen is off and use the volume rockers as camera shutter.. Coming to the image quality, daylight shots are good with vibrant colors, but the sharpness and saturation are a bit more. Macro shots are good offering nice bokeh effect, thanks to f/1.9 aperture. HDR shots are good as well. Low-light shots have some noise as usual, but the images are not too bad. Images with flash are good since the flash offers an ample amount of light and is not over powering.. Overall the camera is good and the OIS is an added advantage for capturing blur-free shots.. Check out some camera samples below (Click the image to view full resolution sample.). Check out the complete set of Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) samples here. It can record videos at 1080p full HD resolution at 30 fps. Thanks to the OIS video good and can handle shakes to some extent. The video quality is also good, offering vibrant colors and it is sharp with good details. Audio is crisp as well, thanks to the secondary microphone. Sadly, it doesn’t have slow motion recording. Check out the video sample below.. Coming to the software, it runs on Android 5.1.1 (Lollipop) with Samsung’s own UI on top. Samsung doesn’t say when it will roll out Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) update for the smartphone. The lockscreen lets you launch the dialer and camera easily.. The drop-down notification bar has several toggles and lets you customize the row accordingly. It also has brightness slider with auto brightness toggle, S Finger, Quick Connect and an option to switch either SIMs as primary.. It has multi-window that can be launched during multitasking and a Smart Manager app lets you manage your device’s battery life, storage, RAM usage, and security all in one place. The Ultra data saving mode powered by Opera Max compresses cellular data across all contents such as videos, photos, media, almost all apps and websites. It compresses and reroutes data to the data-savings cloud using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). You can also add app exceptions if you don’t want data from an app to be compressed. It offers timeline of app usage and how much data is saved in a day or month. You can also check out data savings by individual app as well.. Out of 2GB of RAM, you get 1.84GB of usable RAM, out of which about 651MB of RAM is free when the default apps running in the background. Out of 16GB of internal storage, 10.8GB of storage is usable. You can also move compatible apps to the SD card when you insert one.. The phone has a fingerprint sensor built into the home button. Placement of the sensor below the display is not as comfortable as the sensor placement on the back of new Nexus phones. Fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone will be easier to access since it is the place where your finger rest when you are holding the phone. It doesn’t unlock when the screen is locked, so you need to press the power button or the home button and then place you finger for it to unlock. It doesn’t recognize your finger properly if it’s wet. You can add up to 3 fingerprints. It can also be used for Samsung Pay in some markets where the service is available.. Apart from the usual set of utility apps and Google Apps, the smartphone comes with MixRadio, which is available for all the Samsung phones through exclusive partnership with MixRadio , Opera Max, which powers the Ultra data saving mode and Microsoft Apps – Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, OneDrive and Skype. It doesn’t have any other bloatware or additional games.. It has a dedicated music player that can play a range of formats and also comes with equalizer. It has SoundAlive+ and Tube Amp sound effects that can be enabled from the settings. This improves the audio when listening through earphones. That said, audio through earphones is good, but the loudspeaker output could have been better. It has FM Radio with auto scanning and recording, which lets you store the recorded files in phone memory or SD card.. It has the usual set of connectivity features such as WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS and NFC. Sadly, it doesn’t have dual-band or 802.11 ac WiFi support. It has 4G connectivity with support for TD-LTE 2300MHz (Band 40) and FDD-LTE 1800MHz (Band 3) for India. Both the SIMs support 4G, but you can enable 4G only in one SIM at a time, while the other goes to 2G. As usual it has Smart Dual SIM feature, similar to other latest Samsung Dual SIM smartphones. This automatically forwards calls from the phone number on SIM 2, even if a user is on the phone with SIM 1’s number. It also has USB on-the-go (OTG) support so that you can connect OTG drives easily. It also has a USB Backup app that lets you backup and restore data such as images, audio, video and documents to or from a USB drive, when you plug-in one.. Coming to the performance, the smartphone has Samsung’s own Octa-Core Exynos 7580 64-bit SoC with eight ARM Cortex-A53 CPUs each clocked at 1.6 GHz per core. The performance is good and there are no lags. 2GB of RAM is enough to run several apps in the background, but the TouchWiz UI uses more RAM. It doesn’t have any heating issues even when using 4G or during intensive gaming. Check out some synthetic benchmark scores below.. It scored 37418 points in the AnTuTu Benchmark 5.. It scored 1682 points in the Vellamo 3.1 Multicore benchmark.. It scored 7945 points in the 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited GPU Benchmark. Check out the complete set of benchmark scores here. We tried several games, and some games were not completely smooth, but graphics was average.. Coming to battery life, the 2900mAh battery lasts for the whole day from average to heavy use such as 4G LTE with both the SIM cards. With minimal use, it lasts for more than a day. The power saving mode and ultra-power saving mode lets you extend the battery life.. In our battery test the smartphone achieved a One Charge Rating of 12 hours and 53 minutes, which is good. Check out the complete set of Galaxy A5 (2016) battery life test results here .. At a price tag of Rs. 29,400, the Galaxy A5 (2016) is costly compared to other smartphones in the range, even though it is a good upgrade to last year’s A5. If you spend a bit more you can get the Galaxy S6 and also a LG G4 with a dual SIM slot.. Samsung has improved the display, build quality, battery life and also added a fingerprint sensor that was not present in the first A5. It should have opted for a better processor instead of the old Exynos chip when most phones that are cheaper have a better processor. It still runs on Android 5.1 (Lollipop), and Samsung doesn’t have any details when it will roll out Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) update for the phone. To summarize, here are the pros and cons of the smartphone.. Srivatsan Sridhar is a Mobile Technology Enthusiast who is passionate about Mobile phones and Mobile apps.
