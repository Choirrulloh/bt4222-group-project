It allows you to choose your phone first and your carrier second. Upon selecting a plan, simply insert the carrier's SIM card into the phone and you're ready to go.

Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Rating by MobileDokan. Although Sony is not generating much profit through their smartphone sector, they are keep on going with the development of latest technologies to surprise its fans. Sony Xperia C5 Ultra is another add to the unique and elegant Sony Xperia series. The main specialties of C5 Ultra are two. First one being the 6.0" large phablet Full HD IPS screen protected by scratch resistant glass. This can provide excellent video watching, reading and net browsing facility. Sony is pretty much known for its great quality camera. In this device, they brought front camera to a new level for capturing professional selfies. 13 MP front camera comes with soft selfie flash, Sony's own Exmor RS™ sensor, autofocus, image stabiliser, style portrait, 22 mm wide view and HDR for capturing extra bright, crisp, colorful, balanced and stable selfies and groupfies. The main and front camera is of same quality in this device. You can actually switch the same camera to front and back. Another big specialty of this phone can be called its audio quality. There are few enhanced functions for the battery to increase the life. The ultra stamina, extended usage, extended standby etc. mode can boost battery performance to up to 2 days of good regular use. With 64-bit octa-core CPU and 2 GB RAM you don't need to worry about overall device and gaming speed.. User Rating: 3.68 ( 105 votes). Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Rating by MobileDokan.

Hay 164 opiniones del Sony Xperia C5 Ultra .. No tengo ninguna queja de mi c5 ultra, llevo dos años con el celular, sin problema alguno.. A pesar que le he hecho de todo, root, flasheo, cambio de room a android 7.0 y sigue tan fluído como al principio. Bueno camaradas pues yo pasé por el mismo predicamento de ustedes con el C5 ultra, se apagaba al meterlo a la bolsa, al moverlo, al dejarlo sin mover, en fin por todo, 9 meses me duró el gusto de tenerlo, lo mandé al sat y me lo regresaron al mes, supuestamente por falla en el flexo de la batería, a los dos días mismo problema, de ahí le repararon de todo y nunca quedó bien, mi solución, lo vendí para refacciónes, pasé al M5 aqua pero no me gustó porque se calentaba demasiado y la batería duraba muy poco a pesar de que tenía un desempeño mucho mejor que el c5 ultra, después y no escarmetado me compré otro c5 ultra pero esta vez de uso, dos mugrosos meses me duró el gusto, empezó a dar el mismo problema que le pasa al 90% de estos terminales, se apagaba por todo, no tenía pensado gastar más en reparaciones inútiles, por suerte ya conozco a un técnico de confianza y me comentó que es la lógica, no es el procesador ni la batería ni nada de los que les dijeron, es la lógica por problemas de energía y que tarde o temprano todos los c5 ultra pasan por lo mismo, la reparación me saliía en $1800.00 que es casi lo mismo que me costó el terminal y el técnico me decía que igualmente el problema iba a regresar ya que la fabricación de las lógicas de los c5 ultra es de pésima calidad. ¿Solución? Nuevamente vendí el equipo para refacciones y me divorcié de sony definitivamente, yo era fan de esta marca pero la verdad es que ya ha bajado mucho su calidad y más en la gama media, son varios equipos que me salen mal. Si les presenta este problema del apagado no gasten en técnico ni nada porque el problema va a regresar tarde o temprano, vendan su equipo y migren a otra marca. Ahorita estoy probando motorola y de maravilla.. Son unos telefonos que su imagen es casi perfecta.. Donde el unico que esta perdiendo (DINERO Y TIEMPO)..es el cliente... Hola desde hace un par de semanas mi Xperia C5 Ultra comenzo a apagarse solo despues de bloquearlo, al principio sucedio repetidas veces durante el dia hasta con los dias ya no se prendia con facilidad, he buscado por internet algun tipo de solucion pero nada hasta que lo lleve al tecnico y primeramente lo revivieron y calibraron la bateria o algo asi pero al rato apago, otro tecnico le hizo un reballing ya que segun el se habia desoldado la placa con procesador o algo asi, pero oh sorpresa al rato de llevarmelo se apago hasta que se concluyo que era la bateria que esta produciendo este tipo de falla, ire al tecnico y cambiare la bateria pero ya sera lo ultimo que realize porque mas gasto dinero en llevandolo y pagando por algo que no es, lamentable experiencia con este equipo, no tiene ni un año de uso, por favor si alguien ha indagado o encontrado alguna solucion compartanlo..... Compre el C5 hace un poco más de un año, de un tiempo para acá, se apaga solo y al momento de reiniciar, aparece un mensaje de "optimizando aplicaciones" que tarda entre 15-20 minutos en actualizar (y ninguna aplicación parece ser actualizada después de esto).. La cámara frontal dejó de funcionar después de la actualización de software. Restauré configuraciones de fábrica e hice muchos intentos que no funcionaron. Después de esta actualización, Android no pudo hacer su actualización. tuve que eliminar las actualizaciones de varias aplicaciones porque empezaba a salir mensajes de error como: " Unfortunately Facebook has stopped" y pasaba con Google maps, Facebook, Whatsapp, Uber, etc.. Bloqueó mi tarjeta SIM y me quedé sin servicios.. Se calienta muchísimo con menos de 5 minutos de uso. De repente el display se traba y se reinicia solo.. Pensé que Sony era buena marca, pero fué una completa decepción. Nunca jamás volveré a comprar un teléfono Sony y tampoco lo recomiendo a nadie. Es frustrante tener un equipo que no funciona ni en el momento en que más lo necesitas. El peor equipo que he tenido.. Para comentarles que tengo un Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual y presenta también la misma falla de que se apaga al momento de meterlo a la bolsa del pantalón y no lo podía encender. Pero les comento que antes de esto, como a los 8 meses de haberlo comprado me dió el problema de que cuando bloqueaba y volvía a desbloquear el celular, en la pantalla se distorsionan los colores y como que al entrar la pantalla de inicio se volvía a reparar. Luego, en ciertos puntos de la pantalla por ejemplo, cuando escribía, se iba la pantalla, se pone negra y vuelve a los dos o tres segundos. Bueno, volviendo al problema de que se apaga... Resulta que se me cae leve el celular y lo enciendo y prende... Entonces, se me sigue apagando y todo pero ahora he notado algo.. que cuando paso la mano o el dedo en las orillas de la pantalla, se apaga o en ciertos puntos de la pantalla, se apaga igual. Entonces, le tengo que dar un golpecito leve contra una almohada o algo que no lo vaya a romper y enciende... Pregunta: Han considerado que sea el Touch del celular? Ya que la tarjeta lógica es cara en México. Desde entonces que se me apaga más frecuentemente, ya hice una carga de software reinstalando el sistema operativo dos veces y nada... Y ahora ya no tengo señal del proveedor de celular... Si tuvieran que elegir entre Moto G4 normal o C5 ultra con cual se quedan?. Uno de los peores teléfonos que pueda existir, en su salida, tuvo bugs de sobra, ahora en el Android 6.0 solamente tienes dos errores que te pueden molestar casi siempre en cuestión de software, el primero es que al tratar de dar permisos a X aplicación, este te dice que necesitas deshabilitar la superposición de pantalla, al ir a la confirmación y tratar de deshabilitarla, esta opción aparece sombreada y como ya desactivada, lo que al final conlleva a reiniciar el teléfono y cruzar los dedos de que esta vez si funcione; su segundo error es en la pantalla, la tasa de refrescura esta mal, en la parte inferior, donde se encuentran los botones de Home, Back y El de Multitasking, al ver videos que sean "veloces" como acción o cosas por el estilo, puedes notar claramente como la parte inferior de la pantalla del teléfono está desfasado, lo cual es molesto después de 1 minuto de verlo.. En cuanto al hardware, parece que no tiene giroscopio, ya que en apps donde se te pide, no funciona o te dice que simplemente no tienes giroscopio. La cámara solamente se ve bien en zonas donde la iluminación este bien colocada, si empieza a existir una pequeña variación, empieza a contrastar mucho las sombras. Y su HDR es bastante gracioso, no parece tenerlo. Y para el precio que salió, fue una estafa.. Debido a que mi aparato Sony Xperia C5 se activó o activé sin querer su Contraseña de Protección Privada, y al no recordar la misma, Solicito si alguien me puede Informar cómo Desbloquear la Contraseña de Protec Privada ó en su defecto qué pasos realizar para poder Activar y usar mi aparato. Buenos días, tengo un sony xperia c5 ultra que pues para mi es un excelente trerminal el unico problema que tengo es que la pantalla se descontrola de un momento a otro como si el tactil estuviera averiado cosa que me han dicho pero no creo mucho por que solo se descontrola cuando estoy en girardot donde hay un clima bastante calido, la pregunta es: ¿que tan probable es que la pantalla de mi xperia esté siendo afectada por el calor?y como soluciono este problema??.

Sony takes selfies to another level with Xperia M5 and C5 Ultra. Mobile , sony , Sony Xperia C5 Ultra , Sony Xperia M5 , Tech. By Stan Schroeder 2015-08-03 14:41:58 UTC. Sony's mobile division is not doing well — it lost $188 million in the company's first fiscal quarter of 2015 — but there's no denying its smartphones have certain strengths, especially when it comes to their photo-taking abilities.. With its two latest mid-range models — Xperia M5 and Xperia C5 Ultra — Sony seems to be playing to its strengths, as both phones have an insane 13-megapixel front camera.. See also: Sony's latest flagship phone can tell which headphones you're using. In the case of Xperia C5 Ultra, that camera has a 22mm wide-angle lens and is paired with an identical 13-megapixel camera on the back of the phone. Besides taking high-resolution photos, you'll also be able to grab full-HD video with both cameras, and both are equipped with an image stabilizer. There's more that sets this phone apart, too: It has a huge, 6-inch, 1,920x1,080 pixel screen with a barely visible bezel, making it a great device for those who are primarily interested in producing and consuming multimedia.. It's powered by a 1.7GHz octa-core processor and comes with 2GB of RAM, 16GB of memory (expandable via microSD memory cards up to 200GB in size) and a hefty 2,930mAh battery. Its aluminum frame is big — 6.46 x 3.13 inches — but also quite thin, a mere 0.32 inches.. The Xperia M5's 13-megapixel selfie cam is coupled with a 21.5-megapixel camera on the rear, making it one of the most powerful devices out there when it comes to pure photo and video-taking muscle. Highlights include video and image stabilization and 4K video recording.. It's a 5-inch device with significantly stronger specifications than the C5 Ultra — a 2.0GHz octa-core processor, 3GB of RAM, 16GB of memory (expandable via microSD cards) and a 2,600mAh battery. And unlike the C5 Ultra, it's waterproof and dustproof up to IP65/IP68 specifications.. Both devices run Android 5.0 and will be available globally later this month.

It's the glossy rear though that almost ruins a great impression and while this is purely a matter of taste, the poor grip is a tangible disadvantage.

The battery life is one of its main drawbacks and it is a large phone that might turn some people off. Its camera quality isn’t impressive in low light either.
