Zenfone Ares – Pre Order Zenfone 5z – Zenfone 5 Review, Where To Buy, News. We are 100% Asus Zenfone content! Pre order Zenfone Ares, Zenfone 5z and Zenfone 5 reviews. News on all models including: Pro, Max and more!. Asus Zenfone 3 Zoom (ZE553KL) – Pre Order – Full Details and Specs. Update March 2017: You can now pre order the Zenfone 3 Zoom in the US for $406 or $329. We have full details here .. Model Number (Black Model) – ZE553KL-S625-4G64G-BK. It’s official! Here are the first available Zenfone 3 Zoom press photos:. The most impressive aspect of the Zenfone 3 Zoom is the whopping 5,000 mAh battery. Yes, there is also the two lenses in the dual-cameras on the rear of the camera. The zoom can go up to 2.3X magnification. This means blurred backgrounds with sharp up close subject is possible.. The remaining specs are quite typical of this years main Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL). This means the Zenfone 3 Zoom has a Snapdragon 825, 5.5-inch display, 1080p resolution.. The Zenfone 3 Zoom is 7.99mm thin and weighs 170g.. Updated Details: There are numerous leaks on the Zenfone 3 Zoom (ZE553KL). The Wifi certification, Bluetooth certification, TENAA and tipsters.. First, a tipster mentioned a few specifics about the upcoming Zenfone 3 Zoom which of course are unofficial details. That said, this information appears reliable. First, the Zenfone 3 Zoom will have dual rear cameras (which have been confirmed by the official TENAA images) with one of them being a telephoto lens that has more than the 3X optical zooming ability that was found on the original model last year. The tipster apparently has posted incorrect information about the processor because the TENAA documents and Bluetooth certification details show the processor as a SD625 and not the 821 which the tipster claims.. The Zenfone 3 Zoom is only rumored at this point in time. We are making an assumption that with a Zenfone Zoom from the Zenfone 2 Series, that Asus will also be launching a Zenfone 3 Zoom. It seems logical, but nothing is confirmed or even discussed elsewhere. We are going out on a limb you could say!. The fact is in 2015 Asus released the original Zenfone Zoom after the initial rollout of the Zenfone 2 line-up. So the Zoom was released as a specialty phone and was something to talk about in between the Zenfone 2 and Zenfone 3 roll out.. So if there was to be a Zenfone 3 Zoom (ZE553KL) the timing is looking about right based on the previous generation. It’s not meant as a mainstream product but it was meant to be a showcase product. The camera on the Zenfone 2 Zoom was never before seen and as a result, Asus did get some good press and coverage on the phone. It was and still is an impressive feat.. With the high level specs of the Zenfone 3 Deluxe (ZS570KL), especially the Special Edition model, we’re wondering how a Zenfone 3 Zoom could raise the bar even higher. Afterall, the ZS570KL has about the most RAM, fastest processor and most onboard storage available today. A ZE553KL likely could only match, but not better the Zenfone 3 Deluxe. So this means Asus really needs to bring something unique and impressive regarding the camera capabilities.. Shop Now For A Zenfone 4:. Shop now for a Zenfone 4 – International Shipping – eBay.

Taiwan launch event is on August 17th. A few other details on the Zenfone 4 have come forward from Asus CEO Jerry Shen. The Zenfone 4 Max (ZC554KL) is coming first and will be released in some markets at the end of July. For the other Zenfone 4 models, our guess is that pre orders will start in late July or early August. Taiwan will be the first market getting Zenfone 4 models and there will be a country by country rollout during the months of July, August and September..

This was stated officially at the latest Asus investors conference. Asus is expecting the Zenfone 3 Max to be 2/3 of total Zenfone 3 shipments. Asus also said that 90% of the models will be powered by Qualcomm processors and the remaining 10% will be powered by MediaTek processors.. We are 100% Asus Zenfone content..

The Zoom's rear array consists of a 12MP wide-angle lens with ASUS SuperPixel technology that is primed to capture everyday scenes, even in dark environments; the second camera is a 12MP lens with a 2.3x narrower field-of-view for high-quality close-ups from farther away. the ZenFone 3 Zoom's front-facing camera utilizes a 13 megapixel Sony IMX214 sensor that's also equipped with SuperPixel technology for glamour shots even in low-light conditions.

It combines two entirely new camera systems: a 12MP ƒ/1.7 aperture, wide-angle lens with ASUS SuperPixel Technology and a 12MP 59mm-equivalent telephoto lens for high-quality close-ups from farther away.. ZenFone 3 Zoom's f/1.7 aperture is one of the largest found on any smartphone camera and it's coupled with a 1.4µm pixel size (1/2.55" sensor size) that's also among the largest in the industry. The ZenFone 3 Zoom combines ASUS SuperPixel Technology with the SuperPixel Engine to further increases its low light performance by intelligently controlling ISO levels while shooting and noise reduction in post-shot processing.. ZenFone 3 Zoom uses ASUS TriTech+ Technology to add an all-new Dual Pixel PDAF (Phase Detection Auto Focus) system that uses similar technology found in DSLR cameras. Every single pixel on the Dual-Pixel sensor is used for phase detection, enabling auto-focus that's incredibly fast.

ZenFone 3 Zoom ZE553KL 32GB Smartphone (Unlocked, Navy Black) Reviews - page 2 bzzeucxu. ZenFone 3 Zoom ZE553KL 32GB Smartphone (Unlocked, Navy Black) is rated. Rated 1 out of. Nice phone, if you ever get to use it. I purchased a ZenFone 3 Zoom from B&H. Loved it out of the box. Within days I noticed call quality issues on AT&T. I could hear people but they couldn't hear me. Troubleshot with AT&T and don't think it's on their end. Troubleshot with ASUS and they thought it was a faulty microphone. Sent it to them a month ago. Still havn't had even an update on what they're doing other than waiting on parts. ASUS customer service is a nightmare. Weeks ago they hinted that it was having compatibility issues with an AT&T sim card. Something's going on, buy at your own risk. They've held mine so long I can no longer return it.. Rated 5 out of. It's still early days with this phone but so far it's been living to the expectations. Very good camera for photos and video, modern Android OS and some nice extras such as laser to measure distance and some other goodies. This phone feels very robust, mine already came with a transparent protection cover, very good finishing and the battery life is awesome. Still need to use it for a few months to have a feel for reliability.. Rated 5 out of. better than Apple or Samsung at less than half the price. Best battery life of any cellphone, best double camera with 4k video, studio style sound system, using for videography, travel, with unlocked dual sim cards or micro sd card for expandable memory and it came with a case Best value-quality unit available, newly released, will take huge market share once discovered. Rated 1 out of. I wont buy this phone again. After 60 days I have a white line in the botton of the screen, and as I live in another country I cannot change it.... Rated 4 out of. I've used this phone for about five weeks and I've been very happy with it. It comes with a bumper case, which was a nice touch. The phone is snappy and responsive. The fingerprint sensor is very responsive. The dual camera is excellent in bright light, struggles a bit in very low light. Focus is quite fast and color balance is excellent. The camera app has several useful modes, including full manual. The 1x camera gives the highest quality, while the 2.3x camera seems a bit less sharp. After a heavy day of use it's still well above 50%. This is my second Asus phone, and ZenUI never bothered me. Most of the Asus add-ons are regular apps that can be uninstalled if you hate them. It got the Android 7 (Nougat) update about two weeks ago.. Rated 1 out of. Everything is great expect issues during calls. I had constant issues while i am on call. Everyone says they cannot hear me well. Either I have to speak very loudly or use ear phones. My friend has same phone and he had same issue. I liked the phone but its frustrating during calls so ended up returning it.. Rated 1 out of. The phone has a defect on the screen. The phone has a defect on the screen. an unpleasant and annoying horizontal line. Asus lacks quality control b & h lacks quality control. They just asked me apologies ... I do not buy more Asus, I never buy more at B & H. Rated 4 out of. I am very satisfied with my new asus ZenFone 3 zoom. One thing doesn't come in the box extra connector charger..

How Automotive Can Learn from Android's Fragmentat .... ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom (ZE553KL) Review – The Camera isn’t its best feature. The ZenFone Zoom entered the fray as a smartphone-cum-DSLR, a serious contender for the photographer that doesn’t want to lug bulky photography gear on a quick jaunt. It resembled a camera with a circle representing a faux lens, a leather exterior, and a sleek design. ASUS’ redesign as the ZenFone 3 Zoom maintains sleekness while taking the device in a more minimalist direction.. Facebook Twitter Google+ Pocket WhatsApp. AMOLED screen with beautiful, rich colors. Low system specs means longer load times. Camera works better in situation specific modes than Auto. Good highend build quality with solid specifications. 154.3 x 77 x 8 mm. Dual 12MP, with laser/phase detection AF, 2.3x optical zoom, dual-LED flash. Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with ZenUI 3.0. ASUS ZenEar with Mic, USB Type-C connector, 3.5mm jack. Good Quality Display with good viewing angles & outdoor visibility.. ZenUI is running on Android 6.0 and offers smooth performance with a lot of great features. ZenUI’s Bloatware: What is actually useful. ZenFone 3 Zoom Camera Deep Dive. The Zoom lives up to its name, the 2.3X optical zoom offers a similar amount of detail as its standard lens and usable photos when using the Zoom to its fullest. Not a solid point and shoot camera, the ZenFone 3 Zoom works best in modes specific to the situation. For example, SuperResolution or Night Shot for low light situation or Manual for anything that has a lot of backlight.. Strong low light performance in manual, night shot or Super Resolution, Auto yields below average results. Great battery life, not surprising since it’s sporting a 500mAh battery.. The ZenFone 3 Zoom has ditched the leather of its previous generation for an aluminum body. At 6.07”x3.03” and 170g, it is both smaller and lighter than the iPhone while sporting a smooth 5.5” AMOLED, Gorilla Glass 5 screen.. The chassis is actually a mix of metal and polycarbonate, the plastic sits on the top and bottom of the handset. We actually like that the corners aren’t metal, this slightly more forgiving material actually acts to absorb the impact of any accidental drops.. Every button is positioned in such a way as to allow quick travel around the device. The volume buttons are above the power on the right side. At the bottom of the handset you’ll find a USB Type-C port, 3.5mm headphone jack, and speaker. Continuing around the phone, a pinhole on the left reveals a dual-Nano SIM card / microSD tray. To take advantage of the second SIM, though, you’ll have to go without the microSD card.. The bezel is large, especially the bottom where you’ll find the capacitive touch buttons. As a result, it has a pretty poor screen to body ratio of 70.2%. The dual camera at the top-back is far less obtrusive than the large circular bump of its predecessor. The placement of the physical buttons in one location and back, home, and menu buttons at the very bottom makes navigation and use very simple and convenient.. We don’t want to harp on it, but it is worth mentioning that during the review period a few people have commented on my using an iPhone. Seeing them side by side it’s easy to see how they made this mistake. With the dual camera placement and the rounded corners, we’d have to agree, though ASUS has done a better job with the camera bump than Apple.. In my tiny, tiny hands, the ZenFone 3 Zoom fit perfectly. In fact, one-handed use was a breeze. The rounded corners, smooth look, and comfortable feel of the device lead to an aesthetically pleasing design and satisfying handheld device.. Inside, the Snapdragon 625 / Adreno 506 GPU combo brings speed and efficient power consumption. The fact that the S625 supposedly consumes 35% less power than its predecessors really shows in the device’s overall performance. After hours of gaming in a single session and despite the metal chassis, I was not feeling the burn in my hand from internal heat. Heat management and battery life seem to be qualities ASUS took into deep consideration when designing the ZenFone 3 Zoom.. Outside, the fingerprint sensor positioning is about an inch from the top of the phone, so about 1/4″ too high. My index finger got quite the workout stretching in efforts to unlock my phone. However, once found, I had zero problems with accuracy. The sensor is very accurate, and almost too sensitive when handling the device, vibrating unnecessarily when merely brushing against one’s palm.. The full spec sheet can be found at ASUS’ ZenFone 3 Zoom page .. The 5.5” AMOLED screen is bright and natural at a 1080×1920 resolution and 404ppi. Colors are unsaturated, which is often a concern with AMOLED displays. Also, the display’s oleophobic coating means that your fingerprints and the oils of your hands won’t be as much of a problem with the ZenFone 3 Zoom. I actually noticed a lack of smudges on my screen, so color me impressed.. Brightness can be turned up/down satisfying both night and day, outdoor and indoor moods. The auto-brightness was somewhat of a disappointment, especially on rainy days, when it often became darker than my eyes found pleasant. In general, it works and I didn’t find myself needing to adjust manually besides two instances of outdoor, rainy days. Since the 3 Zoom has a peak brightness of 500nits, the display has no problems in direct sunlight.. The default color temperature of the display is a little yellow, but its default setting in Screen Color Mode is “Super Color,” meaning it will make everything a little more vibrant and the reds are definitely pulled up quite a bit. To make the display a little more color accurate, I customized the colors to be a little cooler or blue to get higher color accuracy in vivid display mode.. Powered by the efficient and high-output NXP Smart Amp, the device uses a 5-magnet speaker with expanded sound chamber and metal voice coil. What does this mean? Less distortion and clearer, more powerful audio. When I used the speaker to take calls or play music, there was no muffling or static. That tinny quality experience in lower-quality speakers was absent here.. Listening to podcasts without earphones was no problem because of the crisp, clear delivery of the base-positioned speaker. The ZenFone 3 Zoom includes DTS Headphone:X 7.1. This method of software encoding converts your game’s or movie’s surround sound into stereo, simulating surround sound in your headphones. I can say that they’ve mostly succeeded, though the bass left me a little wanting. The subjectivity of sound may lead to some disagreement at this point.. The Zen UI 3.0 is largely smooth and functional. Long-pressing on a blank area of the homescreen brings up a host of features from system management and performance to themes and other customization options. Call me old-fashioned, but I like their continued use of an app tray to keep the home screen uncluttered.. The icons are large and cartoonish in feel, flying in the face of the ZenFone 3 Zoom’s modern aesthetics. You are given the option to resize icons, adjust folder layout, change font types and sizes, customize the look a bit, and change count badges (which are the small numbers that appear on an app letting you know that you have new notifications) by going into the All Apps preferences, but it’s not enough. If you don’t like the default setup, ASUS has lots of themes in their theme store to customize your interface.. If you want to customize your homescreen there are several options available if you long press on any free space. To resize the icons, choose Home – Edit, but you’ll still be limited to 50% original size. Also, you don’t have the option to add rows even though you have more screen real estate to work with; you’re stuck at maximum 5×5. ZenUI allows you to get rid of the All Apps button, but you’re still limited to four icons at the bottom of the home screen. (Long Press – Preferences – Home Screen – Grid Size). If you would like to use the phone without an App Drawer, you can opt to get rid of it in Preferences – Home Screen – Layout. There are a ton of customization options available, too many to go through here, but when getting to know your phone this is a great place to start.. Double-Tap to wake up a device is the first thing that I try out on a new phone, but by default it is disabled. Gestures and motions can be turned on by going to System Settings – ZenMotion – Touch Gesture.. Double-tapping now serves two functions: turning the display on and off. The device can also be woken up by swiping across the screen. Further, you can trace capital W, S, C, Z, V, or lower-case e on the dormant screen in order to active a particular app. These six gestures can be remapped to whatever you use the most.. Flipping the phone over allows you to end a call and “Hands Up”—lifting your device and touching it to your ear—lets you answer a call automatically. To activate, you’ll have to head into ZenMotion – Motion Gestures.. ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom ZE553KL 4GB RAM / 64GB ROM 5.5-Inch 4G Dual SIM FACTORY UNLOCKED International Stock No Warranty (NAVY BLACK). 5 used & new available from $344.94. One of my biggest gripes with this product is the setup process and bloatware. After the initial power-on, you are greeted by a large number of screens and additional “features.” Within the phone customization setup are terms agreements and promotions for Google Services. I get that Android OS is developed by Google, but the initialization process does not seem the time for as placements.. The device comes loaded with software. A plethora of ASUS apps and utilities come pre-installed. Some serve useful functions, but others merely take up space. It’s a good thing that ASUS has made uninstalling and disabling apps very easy: Go to the app tray, press the top-right menu button (vertically placed dots), then select Uninstall/Disable. Only ZenChoice and ZenFit can be uninstalled, but the rest can be disabled. That means they will be unobtrusive, but still remain on your device and show up on Google Play as apps needing to be updated.. Here’s a list of what I would keep:. Mobile Manager : Actually a useful app for stopping unnecessary apps from running, looking at data usage, cleaning your system, and managing permissions. Game Genie : A great companion for gaming on your ZenFone 3 Zoom. It allows for linking with Twitch or YouTube, either streaming or recording your screen while gaming. PhotoCollage : Make photo collages with downloadable themes, cute stickers, and text. The 360 Collage option, where one can create a room with framed photos that you can look at, is neat, but I can’t see myself using it beyond saying, “Huh, neat.” MiniMovie : Make videos and slideshows with your photos using various themes and check out those made by others for inspiration. FM Radio : Works well, but won’t function without a headset. Sound Recorder : A simple, no frills recorder that does as it says. Laser Ruler : It uses a laser to determine how far away something is, though if it’s closer than 10cm it will just show <10cm. Do It Later : A decent task manager that allows maintaining multiple lists that are, separated into normal and app-related, though there doesn’t seem to be a difference.. Here is a list of apps that you might find useful, but I would personally uninstall: Quick Memo : ASUS’ answer to Google Keep with less functionality. WebStorage : ASUS gives you 5GB of cloud storage using your ASUS account, it’s not as seamless as Drive which actually offers you more free space. Backup : Utility to backup contacts, apps, settings, etc. Google’s solution is the same and happens automatically. ZenTalk : A forum app for discussing ZenFone-related topics in multiple regions. Service Center : This is intended to help diagnose problems or find someone that can. It’s a knowledge base of phone numbers, e-mails, and repair status updates. If I need this information I’ll just look it up online, having a dedicated app just in case I need to find information if something goes wrong seems like a waste of space. ZenUI FAQ : A redundant Service Center minus the status updates. ZenCircle : Where you can connect with other users and share 360-degree photos ZenFit : For use with ZenWatch ZenChoice : Intended to help you discover apps you may enjoy using.. Not to be outdone, Google supplies its Android devices with numerous apps from the Google Suite. Google Duo app, which is now available for global calling, makes an appearance alongside mainstays like YouTube, Drive, Calendar, Photos, Maps, and Gmail. In total, I found 16 Google apps included. This amounts to a grand total of 32 stock apps when combined with ASUS’ own offerings. This is a lot of bloatware.. My biggest complaint about the preloaded software is the keyboard. It’s called the ZenUI keyboard and after one week I still find it’s frustratingly inaccurate. What’s more frustrating is that I have to go through the same thing every time I go through a new ASUS phone. There is no way to log in to update it with your words; at least when they were using TouchPal you could log in and not have to spend weeks coaching your new keyboard. It’s an easy fix to just select another keyboard, but their choice here ruins the initial experience of the handset for me.. The ZenFone 3 Zoom is named after the camera. This dual-camera setup is reminiscent of the iPhone 7 Plus. One is a f/1.7-aperture, 25mm wide-angle lens, while the other is a 59mm version offering a 2.3x optical zoom. Like Apple’s latest smartphone, you can instantly bounce between lenses to retain clarity in your shots.. Both cameras shoot 12-megapixel stills using what ASUS calls an improved “TriTech+” autofocus system to keep your images sharp. The system includes dual-pixel phase detection autofocus (PDAF), subject tracking autofocus, and a new, revamped laser focus system. The ZenFone 3 Zoom is also the first device from ASUS to feature its new “SuperPixel” technology, a process which involves “intelligently adjusting ISO levels” and applying noise reduction in post. Such a system, the company claims, gives the phone two and a half times greater light sensitivity than the iPhone 7 Plus. We’ve got a few comparison shots in the low light section, so keep scrolling.. It’s ambitious for ASUS to go after the exact same setup as the iPhone, even though they were leading with last year’s version of the Zoom well before Apple. Last year’s model did see significant improvements to the camera after launch, which is why we’re cautious to be too hard on it.. I do have to hand it to ASUS and these books are a prime example: The text on the 5X is clear and usable.. Now let’s take a look at the photo on the phone. The colors are punchier and the text does seem to be a little sharper, although the glare on the “How to Buy Stocks” book seems very digital and not at all natural. Even though I’m not crazy about the quality, considering how far away we were, I have to admit that I’m impressed.. It takes a lot of work to get good low light photos out of the Zoom, but it’s worth the extra time and effort. It’s extremely annoying that the auto mode doesn’t actually suggest that you go into low light or Super Resolution (a mode that is meant to have an extremely high sensitivity to light). The photos are very vibrant and offer a good amount of detail.. The 2.3X zoom has slightly more digital noise than the standard lens. The peanuts look good at 2.3x zoom, but the standard lens does feel more clear.. Now, let’s compare the ZenFone 3 Zoom to the iPhone 7+. The ZenFone 3 Zoom is clearly more natural, however, when you look at the photos on your phone, the iPhone 7+ appears to be superior.. We did find issues with the way the Zoom handles red in low light; it’s often orange and you really do start to lose photo quality when you zoom in.. 5X Zoom – It took 4 attempts and a lot of playing with exposure to get it to this shade of red. Usually, I don’t like to compare one phone to another so much during a review, but with a phone that values Zoom so highly that it’s in the device name, it can’t be helped that you want to see how it stands up to Apple’s latest sweetheart of a feature.. When it comes to the amount of detail available, the Zoom does often outperform the iPhone.. Depth of Field is that amazing blurry background and the reason why so many people love their DSLR. Smartphones attempt to replicate with the digital Bokeh; it’s not the real deal, but it does add a lot of drama. It’s also sadly an area that the Zoom pretty much fails completely. First off, the subject can’t move because the Zoom takes 2 photos: There are two visible and audible pictures taken. Then you have to wait 3 or 4 seconds for the phone to process the two photos to create the Bokeh. It’s painfully slow and if you’re trying to take candid photos it’s nearly impossible.. It was easy for me to forget that the photo quality of the Zoom could be on par with the industry’s top flagship phones because the photo failure rate was so high. You need to have the actual patience of a photographer to make this smartphone camera shine.. In the right conditions, the Zoom is capable of a good depth of field photo, but more often than not you’ll find uneven edges and errors in processing.. Putting the ZenFone up against the iPhone in the nightmarket was a disaster for the Zoom. There, I took some photos of a gentleman waiting for his wife. He stood there for about 5 minutes and ignored me trying to take his photo. I even changed angles to try to get closer without putting the phone in his face! Here are the best three photos:. This is what the iPhone could do in a quick shot. If taking candid photos of peole is very important to you, this is the king. Having said that, is it worth spending twice as much for this one capability?. The Zoom takes a very decent selfie. Beautify mode is extreme but can be very natural if you turn down the settings.. 6 hours screen on time + 1.5 hours streaming music + 2 hours Hot Spot = full day battery life for an aggressive user. The battery is truly amazing; I came to the point where I was actively trying to kill it since it lasted so long. The massive, bulky 5000 mAh battery will last a light user two days and a heavy user will have room to spare at the end of the day.. To give you an idea of just the battery life beast we are dealing with here: 6 hours of screen on time, which included 5 hours of gaming, plus 1.5 hours of streaming music (we count streaming music as screen on time), AND we shared a WiFi Hotspot with our laptop for 2 hours! The 3 Zoom lasted a day and a half under heavy use.. Airplane Mode on a night + 45min of streaming music +10min of camera +20min maps navigation = average use. On a day where we weren’t trying to drain the battery gaming and just checked Facebook, Instagram, chatted on WhatsApp & Messenger, along with 2 hours of streaming music and viewing maps to get around town, we easily saw our day ending with 50% battery left.. We see 36-40 hours of light use, with ASUS claims 48 hours of talk time, 25 hours of Wi-Fi browsing, and a little over 6 hours of video watching. Notably, ASUS states that the phone can idle for 42 days. With an OTG adapter, the ZenFone 3 Zoom could be used as a powerbank for other devices without worry that it’s going to run out of juice.. Unfortunately, there is no quick charge, which is something you’d expect at this price point. The battery takes two hours and 20 minutes to charge and from 0-50% takes about an hour.. ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom ZE553KL 4GB RAM / 64GB ROM 5.5-Inch 4G Dual SIM FACTORY UNLOCKED International Stock No Warranty (NAVY BLACK). 5 used & new available from $344.94. At launch, the expected price for the ZenFone 3 Zoom in India will be ₹25,995 ( about US $388). In the United States, customers can expect around US$471 for an unlocked phone. The price tag is a little high, but considering the good camera performance and battery life, it’s competitively priced.. 14 2 1 0. The ZenFone 3 Zoom is a solid phone with battery life that puts it at the top of the list for phones we would recommend. The UI is buttery, the performance can’t be faulted, the display is brilliant, and the sound quality is excellent; these qualities are all first rate. The Camera is great but it takes a lot of patience, it's not a fast acting point and shoot. Like a real camera you often to have to tweak the settings to get the best shot..

ASUS has raised the bar with its new ZenFone 3 line, showing the world that you can have a top-notch design with cutting-edge technology and killer pricing at different price points.

The ZenFone 3 Zoom is now officially out in the Philippines, with pricing available for those planning out their budget.. The ZenFone 3 Zoom starts at PHP 23,995 for the 32GB version.

The phone comes with a 5.5-inch Super AMOLED 1080p Full HD display, powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 chipset clocked at 2Ghz. An Adreno 506 GPU takes care of all the graphical heavy lifting. It has 4GB of RAM, and options for 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB of internal storage, along with a microSD slot for expansion.. The camera is a dual lens 12-megapixel array with a special trick: laser autofocus. It also has dual LED flash and optical image stabilization. The front camera is a 13-megapixel affair. The phone is very modern with USB Type-C as the port of choice, and also has a fingerprint scanner at the back. A 5,000mAh battery rounds out the package and provides many hours of use.. The phone is available in Navy Black, Glacier Silver, and Rose Gold.. Read more news on this product. About ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom ZE553KL. ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom ZE553KL: More Battery and More Cameras.

Asus Zenfone 3 Zoom ZE553KL - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 … 28 29 ». Anonymous, 12 Dec 2017 Dear GSMArena, please put a review for this phone. Why did you rather put a review on pathetic... more This phone's battery life won't let you go down :). I constantly get around 9h of SOT with heavy gaming use, and around 12h of SOT with light use (YouTube, Browsing). The low-light camera performance kinda sucks on auto, but you can tweak it freely with manual mode. On daylight, it's not the best I've seen but great nonetheless. UI also sucks, I use Nova Launcher instead. Performance is so-so if you use it for gaming, no issues for daily light tasks though. (u can check my comment from Dec 2017). Design-wise it's definitely not original nor grippy on hand (slippery that is) and leaves smudges when you touched the back. Though, I always have a case for extra protection. DTS audio is mostly for gimmicks, my old ZenFone 2 can do better with earphones (DTS makes me can't manually change the bass anymore D:). Speaker is mono but it's quite loud, no distortion even on full volume. I rarely took a selfie, but when I do it turns out quite good, but don't expect it to do well on low-light though. No NFC and that's kinda sucks, fingerprint recognition isn't the fastest around but it's accurate most the time. Alright, hope this mini-review helps you :). Lauryboy, 20 Jan 2018 I'm appalled at gsm arena for not reviewing this phone while it does "long term" reviews of ot... more Yea, such a downer they don't review this phone. But hey, super wide-angle vs zoom lens there. I love super wide-angle more but this phone's endurance doesn't let me to look at other option :). For the guys who had their replacement, did you update your system? From marshmallow to nougat? Im currently using my second zoom 3. Asus replaced my first cause of whiteline. I kinda read here somewhere that whilteline appears days after upgrading the system. I could say its probable because thats what happened to my first. I havent upgraded my replacement yet cause the whiteline could appear again. Any insights that could help? Thanks. Asus zenfone 3 zoom , 27 Dec 2017 I hate the Camera during indoor shot with people at a sunny environment faces of people you sh... more Try reading the threads in ZEN talk for any tips on how to properly take pictures with the Zenfone 3 Zoom. It has a big AMOLED screen, excellent grip, fantastic camera with dual lens and a really big battery. The only flaw is that GSMArena specs are wrong. Saddly to see it connecting to my ac router at 72Mbit/s datalink while my very very old Samsung Galaxy S4 does this ate 433Mbit/s!. Can i connect this phone to a projector? Any who had tried it?. I believe the white line issue indicates a more serious innate defect with the screen. I had the white line appear for no reason but I did not send it to ASUS since it did not affect function. But 6 months into using, I dropped the phone from bed height and though it barely cracked the screen, the whole screen faded to black. When I tried to recover files through USB, it would no longer be recognized by any computer. Hours later, it started beeping randomly and couldn't be shut off by holding power. So in essence, completely wrecked from a minor drop. I've owned older ASUS phones that had a completely cracked screen but still functional, so I believe the fault is with this model.. the best phone until now (year 2018). best performance, big battery, great camera. Why this phone so much expensive??? the price when launched is RM2099 and it still same until now, while zenfone 4 ze554kl launched with lower price which RM1999 but now the price getting down around RM1399 for 4gb RAM model. I'm appalled at gsm arena for not reviewing this phone while it does "long term" reviews of other phones. I've got a LG G6 but I hate the 18:9 aspect ratio so had to get another phone. After hearing about the white line issue with the Zoom S, I was a bit sceptical about buying it. But I took a risk and luckily haven't got the white line issue yet. The macro pictures come out better with the LG G6 however, other shots are a bit sharper on the Zoom S, which I really like. The optical zoom is a nice upgrade from the G6. Much louder and sounds better than the G6 loudspeaker. Music sounds really good with the earphones too. Battery life is also awesome considering the 5000 mah battery. It easily lasts 2 days with average use. I've had no connectivity issues with the phone, be it calls on 4g/3g networks, sms, Bluetooth connectivity and download speeds. Haven't tested wifi but I'm sure it should work fine too. Does this phone support HDMI out? Is it through the USB-C plug? Thanks!. Anonymous, 12 Dec 2017 Dear GSMArena, please put a review for this phone. Why did you rather put a review on pathetic... more I agree, GSMArena must be review this phone, this phone is not too bad as I read comments here. There is much Zenfone 3 Zoom work as well around the world but they don't complaint of course. And if GSMA review this phone, it's might be the best battery life's 2017 phone.. I hate the Camera during indoor shot with people at a sunny environment faces of people you shoot became washed out and became darker face.. Screen in the dark room you will notice some kind of cloud like inside the screen.. What i like is the battery super battery also speaker external or headset is crisp and clear also very fast wifi connection fast downloading... this smartphone may be mid-range due to the old chip inside, but it has alot of configuration on display and camera. It can also handle high end games. Therefore, I see this as a high end smartphone. I use this smartphone more than my LG G6.. Anonymous, 19 Nov 2017 2 foot drop on the top left corner with phone case on. Screen faded to black shortly afterward... more Mine also drop once the side near volume open up. Using this for about a month. Photo quality is good ,low light is also good. Battery is impressive but its not so durable. Ive been using too many sony xperia last time,i dropped them accidentally for too many times but still okey. I drop this phone just once then near the volume the metal open up.. How come ASUS just one drop and the side metal open up so quick .... Got my screen cracked recently, it's only the gorilla glass though, but the glass and the screen is in one module so they replace the old screen. I have to say this new screen is really different in a good way. When the screen is off and reflecting light, the old one is greenish, but the new one is bluish. I'm pretty sure it's Samsung's AMOLED cuz my brother's s8+ also looks bluish. Probably because it's Samsung's AMOLED, it gives the deep absolute blacks that made my old screen looks terrible (uh, brownish black on 0% brightness on old screen, no white line though). So in conclusion, while I might be losing when my screen cracked (had to spent roughly $70 and waiting for 2 weeks) I also gain because of the deep absolute black the new screen displayed. I don't recommend you to drop your ZenFone 3 Zoom now to make an alibi so you can replace the original screen that sucks... But anyway I'm very happy with the replacement screen :D.

The Taiwanese handset maker, Asus has been really stepping up its game with a number of impressive handsets this year. After having launched its flagship device and a budget smartphone, the handset maker is gearing up to expand its lineup. This time around it is the camera centric variant of its Zenfone series, Zenfone 3 Zoom. The highlight of this handset is the dual camera on the rear panel and build quality. Here is a brief overview of the device for anyone who wants to get their hands on one of these.. Dual Camera module : The handset maker has been hyping about the camera module on this device and has even touted it to be better than that on the iPhone 7 Plus. Combine the dual camera mode and Asus's Pixelmaster technology, together they produce some stunning images. Both camera modules on the rear panel is 12 Megapixels, whereas, the front camera is 13 Megapixels.. 12x Zoom: When you have a world class camera on your smartphone, you also need to be able to use it to its full potential. However, most camera smartphone with powerful cameras lack the basic function of proper zoom. Not Asus Zenfone 3 Zoom, it has a total digital zoom of 12x and 2.3x of optical zoom, which lets users capture far away objects with clarity.. ASUS SuperPixel Technology : This technology by Asus is intended to offer an even better photography from what is probably the best camera in the handset market as of now. The technology enables the device to capture impressive low light images.. SonicMaster Audio: Are you fond of listening music or watching movies on your device and disappointed with the audio output?

Its optical zooming capabilities are not amazing, but itâs a nice feature to have. I just wouldnât buy the phone solely for that reason. Since the phoneâs focus is in large part on its camera, this is pretty disappointing. At the end of the day, it can take some nice pictures, but they wonât compare to those coming from high-end handsets. The battery is arguably the ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoomâs best feature, not its camera.

None of its big features â neither its dual cameras nor its giant battery â end up really panning out in quite the way Asus clearly hoped, and while they don't utterly disappoint, they're far from the major selling points they were meant to be. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 09/18/2017 Rating: Total score : 71%. Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom review: Source: CNet If you can put up with Asus' terrible bloatware, the Zoom is actually a decent midrange phone with amazing battery life. The dual-camera features are useful, but not really a must-buy. If you want great design and don't need dual-cameras, the original Asus ZenFone 3 ($254.99 at Amazon Marketplace) still feels like the better buy (even though it's a year old). Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 09/02/2017. 80% Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom Source: PC Mag The $329 ZenFone 3 Zoom sits between the $299 Moto G5 Plus and the $399 ZTE Axon 7 in terms of price. With its gargantuan battery, dual-camera setup with telephoto zoom, and host of unique features, it manages to stand out, which is more than you can say about many phones in the price range. And with its recent update to Android Nougat, the software experience is far better than it was at the beginning. Single Review, online available, Medium, Date: 07/05/2017 Rating: Total score : 80%. The ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom Portrait Mode Guide Source: Tech ARP ASUS just released a huge-ass Android 7.1.1 Nougat update for the ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom smartphone. Amongst the many updates and upgrades is a new Portrait Mode. Software bokeh may not be new, but the ZenFone 3 Zoom Portrait Mode promises a better looking and more accurate bokeh effect, thanks to the way it uses its dual camera system.

Its performance is similar to that of less-expensive budget phones, its display is on a par with those of handsets costing hundreds more, and it has dual rear cameras with OIS and a 2.3x optical zoom. But the ZenFone 3 Zoom's best feature isn't even the camera; it's the phone's epic battery life. I just wish this phone's software and interface were more up-to-date, both in terms of design and version number.

With its gargantuan battery, dual-camera setup with telephoto zoom, and host of unique features, it manages to stand out, which is more than you can say about many phones in the price range. But it's 2017 and Android O is around the corner, so we can't overlook the fact that the Zoom comes running two-year-old software. That's why the G5 Plus remains our Editors' Choice on the more affordable end: It features similar hardware, along with newer software and a greater likelihood of updates, no to mention compatibility with every major US carrier. For $100 more, ZTE's Axon 7 is nearly a year old, but it just received a Nougat update with Daydream support, putting it nearly on par with current flagship phones for nearly half the price.

There are some minor issues, including bloatware and lacklustre performance, but it still offers an exceptional value and is worth consideration on the strength of its stand-out camera and battery alone.

Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom Hands On: A Better Attempt Source: Lowyat.net The Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom is a respectable mid-range smartphone. Its Snapdragon 625 processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a whopping 5,000mAh battery is more than enough for an everyday smartphone. Its dual-camera setup also does a decent job, but weâre not quite certain if all of these are worth the ZenFone 3 Zoomâs RM2,099 price tag.

ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom ZE553KL review - Slim photographers flagship killer that lasts for days Source: Tech Nave The ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom ZE553KL finally delivers as the flagship killer that ASUS envisioned the first ASUS ZenFone Zoom to be but with a more balanced processor, enhanced cameras, slim metal body and extremely long battery life. Improving in nearly every aspect from the original ZenFone zoom, it also helps that the ZenFone 3 Zoom ZE553KL is fairly affordable at its current lowest price of RM1888 (the RRP is RM2099) and should give those looking for a performance photography device an excellent cameraphone option compared to todayâs flagships (which are all well above RM2K). Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 04/13/2017. 90% ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom Review: A phone that deserves to succeed Source: KL Gadget Guy The ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom is a smartphone that deserves attention and success, the company has already proven the reusability of optical zoom in today's smartphones with the previous device, which has inspired the iPhone 7 Plus' camera setup, and it done an even greater job by combining the best features of the ZenFone 3 and Max into one single device, fixing things that are once broken and doing things that the iPhone 7 Plus' camera can't achieve. For the things that ASUS has offered in the ZenFone 3 Zoom, its RM2,099 price tag no longer feels expensive, because the phone has a battery size and camera that no other can compete within the same price range.

ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom ZE553KL 4K video recordings show off good stabilization Source: Tech Nave After requests from our TechNavers we recently tried out the 4K video recording capabilities of the ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom ZE553KL. Featuring both Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) and Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS), the ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom also offers up to 12x zoom (5x zoom in video recording mode), a dual rear camera with a dual Pixel camera sensor, 5000 mAh battery and more for just RM2099. The current pricing has dropped somewhat below RM1.9K though, which should make the ZenFone 3 Zoom even more of a flagship killer.

Video: ASUS Zenfone 3 Zoom Review Source: Yugatech The ASUS Zenfone 3 Zoom is not the companyâs first âzoomâ smartphone. In 2015, they released the original Zenfone Zoom, however, it didnât get enough traction considering the price and competition. After two years, ASUS revived the Zoom lineup with a fairly strong combination of premium build, dual rear cameras, capable specs, and large battery. Single Review, online available, Short, Date: 03/16/2017. ASUS Zenfone 3 Zoom Review Source: Yugatech We must admit, we already liked the Zenfone 3 Zoom even before we got our hands on it. Itâs a heavy-hitter in terms of mobile photography. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 03/14/2017. Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom preview: The mid-ranger cameraphone Source: Pocket Lint Overall, the Zenfone 3 Zoom is a mid-range phone with some compelling camera specs and a large battery. We really need to spend more time with it before we can say whether it can capture better photos than competing handsets, and it would be good to know how much the thing costs before giving it two thumbs up. Asus has said it is coming in February, but it's staying quiet on price and availability. Single Review, online available, Medium, Date: 01/09/2017. Hands on: Asus Zenfone 3 Zoom review Source: Techradar The Asus Zenfone 3 Zoom intensely focuses on the two areas of the smartphone we really care about â the camera and battery life. Its camera specs either tie or best the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and iPhone 7 Plus, and weâre anxious to see how it fares when we take real life photos. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 01/09/2017. Hands-on: ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom, a phone with dual cameras and a massive battery Source: Hardware Zone In addition, ASUS is serving up a host of manual controls in its camera app, with options for controlling things like exposure values, ISO, shutter speed, and the focal length. This reminds us of the Pro mode on the Huawei Mate 9, and the two are actually quite similar (Huawei has an extra setting for autofocus mode). Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 01/08/2017. Asus Zenfone 3 Zoom Source: Trusted Reviews As so much of this phone rests on its optical zoom toting camera, I can't really make too many judgements on it without thoroughly testing it. But the camera specs sound strong, so I do have high hopes. That 5,000 mAh battery is another feature, and I'm wondering how long it could possibly last. Single Review, online available, Medium, Date: 01/06/2017. ASUS Zenfone 3 Zoom Initial Review: ZF3 Killer? Source: Unbox Thatâs pretty much it for this hands-on. No official price has been set for this phone in the Philippines as of yet. From what we can surmise, the pricing for this phone will fall close to the official SRP of the original ZF3, which may result in ASUS officially canning the 5.5-inch ZF3 and replacing it with this model. Thatâs our take on it anyway. The phone will hit stores worldwide by February. Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 01/03/2017.
