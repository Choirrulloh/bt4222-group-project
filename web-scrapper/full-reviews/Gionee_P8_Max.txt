Gionee P8M Fero Zoom Vernee Mix 2 LG K4 (2017 ). The Gionee P8 Max lives up to its name, coming with quality features in many categories. It has a 5.5-inch display with capacitive navigation buttons, 3GB RAM , 32GB internal storage and a 3150mAh battery that should last up to a day ; all at an affordable price.. 1 Gionee P8 Max Specs (Key): 1.1 Design & Display 1.2 Memory & Performance 1.3 Camera 1.4 Battery, Connectivity & Software 2 Gionee P8 Max Price and Availability in Nigeria 3 Gionee P8 Max Full Specifications 3.1 GENERAL INFORMATION: 3.2 NETWORK: 3.3 BODY & DISPLAY: 3.4 HARDWARE: 3.5 CONNECTIVITY: 3.6 MEMORY: 3.7 CAMERA: 3.8 BATTERY: 3.9 OTHERS: 3.10 Related. P8 Max offers a reasonable amount of display , coming with a 5.5-inch screen made with the IPS LCD display technology. There is some trade-off her, though, as it has a mere HD (720 * 1280) pixel resolution and 267 PPI pixel density, which is quite small for the display size. That said, the P8 Max’s display still offers good quality and color reproduction.. Gionee P8 Max features metallic body design. The front is quite basic and has been stripped of all the bells and whistles, but the back cover is designed in a way that it illuminates in multiple directions when light is reflected on it. The phone uses on-screen buttons for navigation.. The P8 Max doesn’t come with a fingerprint sensor, so users are restricted to the regular PIN, password and pattern modes of securing Android smartphones. Its front side is covered with Corning Gorilla Glass, as claimed by the company. The version of Gorilla glass on the phone hasn’t been named yet, but I expect that it will be Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The smartphone is quite thick at 9.2 millimetres, which is quite on the high side.. Gionee P8 Max is powered under the hood by a MediaTek MT6737T processor which uses four cores and operates at a clock speed of 1.5GHz. The processor should perform efficiently when it comes to running the latest games and apps, as it has 3GB of RAM to quickly switch between multiple apps without losing state data.. The P8 Max smartphone offers 32GB of onboard storage, but unfortunately, that’s all you have; the phone doesn’t come with a microSD card slot for storage expansion.. The Gionee P8 Max sports a 13MP camera which should capture decent photos. It has a f/2.2 aperture lens and autofocus for…well, automatically focusing on objects as they change position. It is also accompanied by a LED flash which provides illumination for images in low-light conditions.. The P8 Max also features an 8MP camera upfront for selfies.. The P8 Max packs a 3150mAh battery which should last for a whole day. Gionee is know for long-lasting batteries, and the P8 Max is no exception. 5V/2A fast charging is also thrown in the mix to reduce the time it takes to get a full charge on the device.. This smartphone comes with dual SIM slots and supports 4G LTE network connectivity. It runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box, with version 3.2 of Gionee’s custom user interface for its Android smartphones, Amigo OS layered on top with extra software features and optimizations.. The P8 Max is not available in Nigeria at the time of writing but it is expected to cost around #65,000 should it be available in the country..

To recall about its predecessor, the Gionee P7 Max sports a 5.5-inch Full HD IPS display and runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Amigo 3.2 UI on top of it. It is powered by an octa-core MediaTek MT6595 processor clocked at 2.2GHz and paired with 3GB of RAM. It is a dual SIM phone and also supports 4G VoLTE..
