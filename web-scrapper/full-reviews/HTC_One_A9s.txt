Features Fingerprint (touch), Touch sensitive control keys. Resolution 720 x 1280 pixels. Features Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features Autofocus, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI). Software Features RAW image capture, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Camcorder 1920x1080 (1080p HD) (30 fps). Features Hyperlapse, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 2000 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G) 13.11 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G) 18.0 days (432 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Screen mirroring Wireless screen share, MHL. Filter by Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features Album art cover, Background playback. GSM 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD) Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 17, 28.

Other NFC, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. FCC ID value: NM82PWD100 link. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

CNET también está disponible en español.. HTC's new 'diamond-like' One A9S is not short on superlatives. The specs of HTC's newest phone don't dazzle, but the company is proudly boasting that its design will.. by September 1, 2016 8:09 AM PDT. 64-bit processor 13-megapixel main camera with LED. flash 5-megapixel front camera 16GB or. 32GB internal memory (depends on region) microSD slot takes cards up to 2TB HTC. BoomSound 2,300 mAh battery Comes in multiple colors. In the age of phones as metal rectangles, it's not easy to make your product's design profoundly unique. But HTC is doing its best to wow us, at least in how it describes its newest phone, the One A9S.. With phrases like "perfectly glistens" and "nature-inspired" in the A9S's press release, HTC almost trips into hyperbole. It also promises "diamond-like cut buttons", which is a bit odd given that many phones these days ditch buttons almost completely. We'll give you a report on how the A9S looks and feels when we actually hold one. But if HTC's design history is any guide, it should be something of a looker.. An update to 2015's One A9 , the A9S has a slate of popular features without delivering any huge upgrades over its predecessor. Highlights include a 5-inch 720p display, a fingerprint sensor, an octa-core processor and a 13-megapixel camera. The A9S also promises a durable design that will withstand "hundreds of drop and scratch tests in addition to hundreds of hours of extreme weather.". HTC didn't have a final price except that the A9S would cost less than the A9 ($499 or £430). It will be available globally at a yet-to-be-announced date..

Very disappointed with my HTC ONE A9S. Had this phone since september 2017 had signal problems on EE been sent off for repair twice, had a new replacement phone still poor signal my 3 year old HTC one mini 2 has good signal and the battery lasts a lot longer. Rated 1 out of. I'm an HTC fan but that thing is so not HTC. This thing is really annoying, has loads of bugs that will not get fixed. Phone is discontinued - will not receive further Android updates, so you'd be stuck with Marshmallow. You won't hear it ring because the speaker is horrible. After 3 or 4 months of usage, battery started dying, showing me wrong percentage and phone shutting down unexpectedly. It also keeps lowering the volume when I play music and there's no way to disable that. Better get yourself some unbranded phone, would serve you better than that iPhone replica.... Rated 4 out of. I have had a HTC ONE M7 and a M8 so it was natural to go for another HTC phone for my 02 upgrade. I was a bit concerned about the experiences of a poor battery on the HTC a9s. However I went for the a9s and I am glad that I made the choice. I have had the HTC ONE a 9 s since last Thursday at 12.30 and it has been put to hard work installing all my apps, and it has been on from 07.10 am to 23.45 pm each day , and I have only charged it twice and this is Saturday at 21.20. Looking forward to 2 years or even more with the phone.. Rated 5 out of. Had this phone 6 months now, never had a single problem with it from official apps to Sideloaded, battery life has been great using the optimiser, runs really fast, every app is open in seconds. 32gb memory is great, especially since I could add my micro sd, decent camera, and speaker. The most impressive thing is the durability, I have dropped this down stairs, onto concrete (face down) etc multiple times, while it has scuffed on the edges, it's still not got a scratch on the screen, and I've broke a lot of phones!

This is also the case for the One A9s, although we can find some small changes: Our dark gray test model now has a matte finish on the rear, whereas the old model had a brushed metal look. Other available colors are silver and gold, so HTC follows the current mainstream and does not experiment.. The front of the smartphone is completely covered by glass. The small oval fingerprint scanner is sitting pretty far underneath the screen. Similar to the predecessor, there would have been more space for the actual screen. At a length of 146 mm (~5.7 in), the One A9s is a somewhat long smartphone. Otherwise, it is a bit wider than before and much thicker at 8 mm (~0.3 in). The weight was also increased to 150 grams (~5.3 oz).. The chassis is stable and we can hardly twist it, but our attempts cause loud creaking sounds. Pressure on the screen will quickly result in ripples, but pressure from behind is no problem. The battery is integrated and you cannot open the chassis..

USB-OTG is supported by the HTC One A9s, so you can attach external storage devices. You also get a microSD reader, which means the storage capacity can be expanded by up to 2 TB, even though cards with such capacities are not available yet. It is possible to format the card as internal storage, but it is not possible to transfer apps to the microSD when you only use the card as portable storage.. Left side: SIM and microSD slots. Bottom: Speaker, USB, microphone, headset port. HTC ships the One A9s with Android 6.0 and security patches from September 5th, so it is not the latest version. The smartphone could be upgraded to Android 7, but there is currently no timeframe from HTC.. The manufacturer always used customized software versions and tried to improve Android at many points. This is basically a good idea, but it also introduces problems, because the internal functions will not get any updates once the system updates will be stopped. HTC tries to avoid this problem with the implementation of its own apps for a couple of years now, so individual parts are easier to update. However, this also means that some app functionalities are similar to the preloaded Google apps, like HTC's Mail app and "GMail" or "Messages" and the Android messenger.. Also available is the iconic BlinkFeed, which can be accessed with a swipe to the right on the home screen. It shows news and notifications from social media. "Boost+" can be used to clean and accelerate the system. The "Zoe Video Editor" is also a typical app from HTC, which creates movies with several effects from pictures and videos.. You can also install themes on the smartphone, including so called "Freestyle Theme", where you can freely adjust app symbols and stickers on the screen without a predefined grid.. You will have to make compromises in terms of WLAN connectivity: While the. still supported fast 802.11ac networks, the HTC One A9s is limited to 802.11n. This should be sufficient for most Internet connections, but the smartphone cannot use very fast home networks. 5 GHz networks are still supported though.. The WLAN performance is decent in our standardized test, and we determine the expected values both in the send as well as the receive test. We can see, however, a significant performance difference to devices with 802.11ac.. Websites load quickly in practice in close proximity to the router and we have a full signal. The quality does drop significantly at a distance of ten meters (~33 feet) to 1/4 of the signal and loading times are a bit longer, but there is sometimes no connection at all..

The GPS module cannot locate the position indoors, and it does not work close to a window, either. A connection with the satellites is quickly established outdoors though and the accuracy of six meters (~20 feet) is pretty decent.. Our two track measurements between the HTC One A9s and the professional navigation device Garmin Edge 500 differ by 300 meters (~1.9 miles) on the 7 km (~4.3 miles) bicycle ride. Garmin's Edge 500 follows our position more accurately, but the performance of the HTC One A9s should still be sufficient for casual purposes.. GPS HTC One A9s â Overview.

HTC also updated and adjusted the phone app, but the functionality is still very similar to Google's default app.. The voice quality is average: The earpiece is very loud, but the voice from our call partner always sounds a bit dull. The same applies for the microphone: Our voice is a bit dull, but the overall quality of the microphone is still okay. Background noises are audible, but the voice is easy to understand. In general, for calls, there are worse smartphones. The voice output via speaker is also decent.. The technical specs of the cameras look very similar to the previously reviewed. The front camera was quite okay, but the main camera was not convincing. The situation is better here: If HTC uses the same camera module, the Taiwanese manufacturer did a much better job on the HTC One A9s.. The pictures of the 13 MP main camera with a single LED flash and autofocus show much more details in bright and dark areas. We can see slight color fringes at the edges when we zoom in, but the pictures are very sharp overall and the colors are okay, even though we can see a slight green cast. Videos can be recorded in Full HD at 30 frames per second with the main camera. The quality is good: Transitions between bright and dark areas are handled quickly and colors are accurate as well.. The front camera has a 5 MP sensor and takes decently sharp pictures, which are also well exposed. You can zoom in without seeing bigger blurs. The front camera can also take 1080p videos and the quality is good.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. We check the color accuracy of the main camera with a picture of the CalMAN ColorChecker Passport under controlled lighting conditions. Compared to the reference colors, most of the colors are accurate, but bright colors are a bit too dark.. We also take a picture of the test chart under controlled lighting conditions to evaluate the sharpness. One noticeable aspect is that fonts fray on colored areas. The crop from the center is not perfectly sharp either, and we can once again see slightly frayed edges.. The original color is displayed in the lower half of each patch.. Besides the power adapter and the USB cable, the box of the HTC One A9s also includes a headset, so basically the standard equipment.. HTC will also sell a premium pack of the smartphone on its. for an additional 40 Euros (~$42). The set includes a transparent cover for the rear, a protective display cover and a better headset. It is currently not possible to get these accessories separately.. HTC grants a 24-month warranty for its smartphones.. HTC uses the virtual keyboard "TouchPal", which can be adjusted in many ways. You can change the size of the keyboard or split it. Due to the secondary functions, however, it is a bit too crowded compared to the default Android keyboard in our opinion. Of course, you can activate the default keyboard in the settings or download other layouts from the Play Store.. The touchscreen is precise and very responsive in the corners. The fingerprint sensor underneath the screen also works as a home button and there are surrounding touch buttons for the menu functions. At the right side of the case is the ribbed standby button, which is easy to find thanks to its surface. The volume rocker is easy to use as well.. Unlocking the smartphone via fingerprint scanner is easy and simple: Just put your finger on the sensor. Unfortunate: You have to tap the fingerprint scanner twice during standby to unlock it, one tap is sufficient for other smartphones.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

Compromises compared to the previous model have to be made in terms of the display as well: At the same size (5 inches), the resolution was reduced to 1280x720 pixels. It is not an AMOLED panel anymore, either, but a conventional IPS screen. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the average luminance of 320 nits is a bit low. The brightness distribution of 85% is okay, and you can only see slight brightness differences on large colored surfaces.. 296 cd/m² 335 cd/m² 310 cd/m² 306 cd/m² 348 cd/m² 310 cd/m² 304 cd/m² 348 cd/m² 321 cd/m². 85 % Center on Battery: 348. cd/m²) ΔE Color 3.5 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 4 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 95.1% sRGB (Calman) Gamma: 2.3.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. The black value of 0.23 cd/mÂ² on the other hand is very good, which results in a good contrast ratio of 1513:1. However, the AMOLED screens of the. have completely black pixels and therefore an infinite contrast ratio.. We use the software CalMAN and a spectrophotometer for further analysis of the colors. The deviations compared to the reference color space sRGB are small, but the predecessor managed even better results. Still, you can hardly see differences on the HTC One A9s with the naked eye. The grayscale only reveals a slight green cast, otherwise, the individual shades are very accurate..

This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. The low luminance of the HTC One A9s is a problem outdoors because you can hardly see anything on the screen in bright environments. The brightness sensor tries hard and reacts quickly, but it cannot further increase the luminance of the panel.. The viewing angles are good, but the brightness drops significantly when you change the vertical viewing position. Still, you can see the display contents very well even from extreme angles.. is an upper mainstream SoC with eight cores, and all of them can reach a clock of 2.0 GHz. Still, the performance of the HTC One A9s cannot keep up with the best devices: Smartphones with high-end SoCs from Qualcomm's 810 and 820 series in particular have an advantage.. The performance is still more than sufficient for the operating system in practice and ensures smooth handling. You will only notice differences when you use demanding apps.. ARM Mali-T860 MP2 , and it can actually beat the. from the predecessor by a couple of frames in some tests. However, we obviously have to consider the lower display resolution in the onscreen benchmarks. Once again there are competitors with better performance in this price range..

The SoC and its graphics adapter support modern interfaces like OpenGL ES 3.1, so you can also enjoy modern effects. The smartphone has no problems with the zombie shooter Dead Trigger 2 , where the smartphone breaks the 30 fps barrier and reaches 58 frames per second on average. The racing title Asphalt 8: Airborne. also runs well on the test model, even though 30 fps are just missed at maximum details.. We did not have any problems with controls via touchscreen or the position sensor.. Considering the mainstream performance figures, there should not be any problems with high temperatures, and the HTC One A9s does not disappoint: Up to 33.5 Â°C (92.3. The values are even a couple of degrees cooler while idling.. We use the GFXBench Battery Test to check the performance under sustained workloads.

Speakers and the sound are the highlight on many HTC smartphones. Similar to its predecessor, however, the HTC One A9s only gets one speaker at the bottom and software optimizations for the sound output via headset port. The latter is therefore much better compared to the speaker: The sound from the smartphone does not have any bass and puts too much emphasis on the mid-range and high tones. The maximum volume is quite high, but it will get a bit unpleasant when you crank it up due to the missing bass..

Our measurements determine rather high consumption values. This might be a result of the SoC with eight fast cores instead of some frugal cores we know from other SoCs. It is interesting that the load consumption is not that high in comparison. Overall, the results are still a bit disappointing. Thanks to its low resolution and the dark display, the HTC One A9s could have been a very frugal smartphone..

The high consumption figuresâexcept for load scenariosâare combined with a small battery capacity of just 2300 mAh or 8.7 Wh. The HTC One A9s still manages a decent runtime of 8:37 hours in our WLAN test, and the overall stamina is not bad. lasts even longer, but the results of the HTC are at least better compared to the previous model.. The HTC One A9s should also last a demanding business day if you do not use extremely complex apps. Even two days should be possible when you only use it occasionally.

Test model courtesy of HTC Germany.. HTC's One A9s is definitely a solid mainstream smartphone. You can live with the low-resolution screen thanks to the high contrast ratio and decently accurate colors, but the panel is too dark. The missing wireless standard 802.11ac should not be a big deal for many users, either. Performance and memory equipment were even improved â a reason to cheer?. Yes, the HTC One A9s is actually a good mainstream smartphone, but it is a segment with many good devices from Lenovo, OnePlus or Samsung. The competition is therefore strong for the HTC One A9s, and some of them even offer more high-end features compared to our test model. But do you really need dual-LED flash, laser autofocus or higher camera resolutions? Only you can answer that for yourself.. The HTC One A9s is a successful upgrade of the HTC One A9 and puts up decent performances in almost all test sections, but does not stand out from the rivals. There are no real highlights, but you get a reliable device without any frills.. The list of serious drawbacks for the HTC One A9s is quite small: The speaker could sound better and the WLAN signal could be better. Otherwise, the test results are good, but there are no highlights. It is therefore a solid mainstream device and an inconspicuous as well as reliable companion in practice, which can be a quality as well.. HTC One A9s - 2016-12-15 12/15/2016 v6 Florian Wimmer.

I grew up with computers and modern consumer electronics. I am interested in the technology since I had my first computer, a Commodore C64, and started building my own PCs after that. My focus here at Notebookcheck is the business segment including mobile workstations, but I also like to test new mobile devices. It is always a great experience to review and compare new products.

Tesla's electric trucks may be more cost-effective than expected. HTC One A9s dons a familiar metallic design and cheaper tag. Anything to help the company boost sales.. Last year we were left impressed with HTC's premium mid-range One A9 smartphone: It was a good-looking phone with great build quality and great battery life, plus it was one of the first to ship with Android Marshmallow. It was apparently so "well received" that HTC decided to release a follow-up model. The new and supposedly more affordable One A9s features a near-identical metallic design plus the same fingerprint sensor on the front, with the main aesthetic changes being the earpiece is now shorter, the proximity sensor is in the middle and the front HTC logo is gone. Eagle-eyed folks will notice that the old 5-inch 1080p AMOLED display is now just a 720p Super LCD, so it better be a noticeable price drop.. The 13-megapixel main camera here has gone from f/2.0 to a slower f/2.2 (it's likely no longer using the same nice Sony sensor) and lacks optical stabilization, but still comes with RAW support; whereas the old UltraPixel front camera is now just an ordinary 5-megapixel imager. The old Snapdragon 617 has been replaced with MediaTek's octa-core Helio P10 (8x Cortex-A53), but it's hard to tell whether this is an upgrade or a downgrade just yet. At least we know that we'll still be getting Cat 6 LTE and NFC here, just no 802.11ac WiFi.. Gallery: HTC One A9s | 16 Photos. Depending on where you're buying the A9s, you may get either 16GB or 32GB of internal storage plus 2GB or 3GB of RAM, and you can expand storage space via microSD (up to 2TB). The built-in battery has been gently bumped up to 2,300mAh but there's no fast charging feature this time, so here's hoping the A9s has at least inherited the same impressive battery life optimization from its predecessor. What we do wish HTC had changed was the USB port: We're already entering the last quarter of 2016 and HTC is still using micro-USB instead of USB-C; but then again, we're not exactly short in micro-USB accessories, and it's probably the least of HTC's target audience's worries in this price segment.. Speaking of, we're still left in the dark in terms of actual price points: We're only told that the A9s "will be very competitively priced at the mid-tier," which doesn't mean much given HTC's track record. If priced right, the A9s' fancy metallic design may still be compelling enough to help drive sales before the year ends.. Update: HTC just informed us that the One A9s "will be priced in the range of €299" or about $335 off-contract.. We're live all week from Berlin, Germany, for IFA 2016.

The HTC 10 is an underrated phone with excellent sound quality Still looks beautiful IFA 2016 is Europe's biggest tech show. The TechRadar team is in Berlin to bring you all the breaking news and hands-on first impressions of new phones, watches and other tech as they're announced.. The HTC One A9S is a curious phone. Last year's One A9 was strikingly similar to Apple's iPhone 6 , and it seems HTC has taken the idea of 'adding an S to the name and just tweaking the spec' straight out of the Apple playbook.. In fact, it seems to have doubled down on that strategy by not only offering very few spec upgrades in the One A9S, which was announced at IFA 2016 , but actually dialling down the performance in some areas.. Gone is the 1080p AMOLED screen, the Snapdragon chipset and the 13MP f/2.0 camera – in its place is a 720p LCD display with a Mediatek octacore chipset, and the same 13MP camera resolution but now at f/2.2, so lower-light photos will be slightly harder to pull off successfully.. The battery has been pushed upwards to 2300mAh – still low, but combined with HTC's Boost+ it may be able to over-perform for its size. That's especially true if the phone comes with Android Nougat , which promises to be even kinder to batteries than Marshmallow and its decent Doze mode; however it's likely that HTC will launch the One A9S with the previous version of Android, and upgrade it later in the year.. However, it's unfair to only focus on the specs, because the HTC One A9 was a well-made, all-metal phone for a little less cash than other flagship models, and the A9S continues that tradition. It'll be a well-crafted handset for less money – although some regions will get a 16GB+2GB RAM version, whereas others will be offered the 32GB+3GB RAM option.. There are no front-facing speakers here to shout about, although the 5-inch screen fits well in the hand – the wrapped metal chassis feels pleasing under the fingers in the One A9, and it should be the same here. Storage can be expanded through microSD – and all the way up to 2TB, which not a lot of phones can offer right now.. The real sticking point here is the HTC One A9S price... or rather the lack of one, with the brand simply telling us "[The One A9S] will be very competitively priced at the mid-tier".. Without that important detail right now, it's hard to say whether this is a phone worth checking out. If it lands for around £175 / $250, then HTC could have a real power-player in the mid-tier market – a market that's fast becoming crowded, with the likes of the OnePlus 3 and ZTE Axon 7 kicking around.. We'll update this story with any more information on the phone as soon as we get it – fingers crossed it's news of a half-decent price..

HTC One A9s is official with more iPhone similarities and worse specs than the A9. 2016/09/01 1:49am PST Sep 1, 2016. We only heard of the new HTC iPhone One A9s a couple of days ago when. Evan Blass leaked the first render of the phone. Thankfully, we didn't have to go through weeks of more torturous rumors over the existence and purpose of this device, as HTC has just. The "successor" to the One A9. pushes its iPhone inspiration to new. levels (yes, we know HTC introduced the. general look first, but this is more of a blatant copy than the iPhone ever was of the One series) thanks to a top left rear camera and LED flash, removed HTC logo from the front, and smaller earpiece. The only thing HTC seems to have done differently is the use of a dual-finish metal for the sides and the rear of the phonee, to create a distinct tone and light reflection for the frame of the device compared to its back. It remains to be seen whether that differentiates the look of the A9s in real life or not.. But I put the "successor" between quotes in the paragraph above because while technically this is the follow-up to the One A9, the specs would have you think otherwise. has gone from 1080p to 720p, the 13MP camera went. from an F/2.0 aperture to F2.2 (and apparently no OIS), and at. 146.49 x 71.5 x 7.99 mm and 149.8g,. is taller, wider, thicker, and heavier than the A9. The port seems to still be a MicroUSB one, and the RAM/storage options remain the same, namely 2GB/16GB and 3GB/32GB versions.. On the plus side, the front camera is now 5MP instead of 4MP, the battery has grown from 2150mAh to 2300mAh which should last a lot longer with that 720p display. And depending on how you feel about either, you'll see it as a positive or negative that the Snapdragon 615 has been replaced by the MediaTek Helio P10 with 4 Cortex A53 at 2GHz and 4 others at 1.1GHz.. With all that said and done, the A9s isn't much of an improvement over the A9. The better guess is that HTC has decided to cut corners to lower the selling price of the phone. That was, after all, the major downside to the A9 from the moment it was announced.. There's no word on which version of Android the A9s will run when it launches, but. given how enthusiastic HTC is about updating its old devices, I'm going to bet on Marshmallow. Exact availability isn't disclosed either, neither is the price. All we know is that it will come in Aqua Silver, Cast Iron, and Metal Gold. Because gold isn't normally a metal....

Google's Calculator app hits 100 million downloads on the Play Store. 2018/01/31 9:34pm PST Jan 31, 2018. I am not going to lie - and this might be an unpopular opinion here among the elitists here, but I like this phone.. Why so? Copying the iPhone's look is okay me, if that leads to more cases, but everything else seems like a downgrade.. Thing is, it's a blatant copy. I wonder why Apple's lawyers hasn't jumped on HTC for this (specifically the A9s).. Because they agreed not to sue each other, iPhone copied the HTC design first, and now HTC just made a ihtc I guess, smh. I'm pretty sure HTC was doing the antenna bands first. Apple and HTC signed a cross licensing patent deal several years back. Apple had infringed on several LTE patents held by HTC, and were about to be sued into oblivion. HTCs M7 looked like an iPhone6 before it existed. That's the point of an opinion. But this phone is a terrible idea.. If it were sold for $299, it'll be a heck of a deal, but knowing HTC, $499.. I don't know man, you can get much better phones (specs-wise) for that price.. nexus 5x anyone? no metal, but its a looooooooooot better :). Honestly, I'd probably use it if it were given to me. But I wouldn't buy it for more than $199 and I doubt HTC will price it there.. That would be the ideal pricepoint in my opinion. But, the odds are very low... I thought I was in AndroidPolice, why did you guys even cover a news about the new iPhone?. We like to keep an eye open on the competition.. I am a A9 user and I like it a LOT (except batteries). Who really does this sort of thing year after year at HTC? I mean you can only take so many missteps???. Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours and have longer with friends & family! !ic704t:. On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. It sounds unbelievable but you wont forgive yourself if you don’t check it. I am a A9 user and I like it a LOT (except batteries).

Who really does this sort of thing year after year at HTC? I mean you can only take so many missteps???. Poor HTC, I really wanted them to succeed.. Not when they don't even advertise their flagship (which is a terrific phone, by the way). A spec comparison table would have been nice. I can read paragraphs but there is something called "Optimal way to present information". Reading paragraphs is not fun to compare specs but quick glance at table is all you need.. It's running Marshmallow 6.0, not 6.0.1 with July security patch level. Port is still micro USB 2.0.. (yes, we know HTC introduced the general look first, but this is more of. a blatant copy than the iPhone ever was of the One series). KrApple copied HTC, so you can't say that HTC copied a copy of itself "more blatant(ly)" or otherwise since its always been HTC's original design.. The only "copying" done here is krApple's.. "krapple", really? No wonder other people think Android users are childish and petty.. He's 'verified Trump' so that may have something to do with his mental state.. True, though articles like this make android users look pretty too imo. Who cares about camera position and where the logo is - there are only so many choices on a phone. Everyone else has to have centre cameras and logos on front to avoid the apple copying claim?. Or maybe the point is that android users don't want a phone that looks like an apple phone, I can understand that - but again, the "omg, it has a centre camera and no front logo JUST LIKE AN IPHONE" is not doing well on not being petty.. Have you seen the iOS trolls?. You don't laugh about mentally ill people.. I think all HTC "s" is freak: M8s, M9s, now A9s. If HTC thinks their older flagship design is still attractive so that they come up with those models, then, very very bad move indeed. But I can't deny that M8 M9 and A9 got good design and feeling in hands. Let's see what HTC can give us on Nexus 2016.. Front camera is a downgrade, it used to be a 4 "UltraPixel" camera with a 1/3" sensor, now it's just a run off the mill 5MP 1/5" or 1/4" sensor at best.. Good god! I never understood the hype of HTC and they continue to (not!) disappoint me. I hope they price this HTC iPhone 5S at $100 or lower, otherwise I don't see any takers.. During the early years of Android, they were top of the pile in terms of design and performance. But around the time of the Thunderbolt they seemed to start to lose it. Samsung leapfrogged them and they just never seemed to recover. There was a glimmer of hope when the One M7 debuted, but then they phoned in the M8 and M9. It's like they can't be fresh more than ever few years.. Camera position makes it an iphone clone? That's like saying my nexus 6 is a galaxy clone due to a centre camera. There are only so many sensible places for a camera. No logo on front? Same as loads of phones - but the lack of a giant apple logo on back is a huge giveaway.. This phone looks far more like a galaxy due to the home button.. Except the Nexus 6 camera is not raised, or squared, or includes a flash mixed with heart rate monitor.. at least Apple doesn't downgrade specs in new devices... Only if A9s will be much cheaper, then somebody may want buy it.. No one cares, that is HTCs biggest problem. Not enough people buy any of their overpriced underwhelming phones. And why should we? The HTC 10 seems like their best phone yet, but guess what... You literally can't go to any store within a 100 miles of my location to check it out before purchasing it. With regards to the copying of iPhone... I mean yeah, they did the antennae lines and metal unibody first. But instead of improving on that design and/or modifying it -- they have opted to take apples 2014-15 version of there 2013 flagship and literally copies the design (minus the apple logo, obviously) exactly. I mean they couldn't even bother using the same dual tone flash they use on the M series. Why not try using the fingerprint on the back and maybe even re introducing the front facing speakers again? There are plenty of small design changes they could have made to make it look different. Instead, they seem to be literally obsessed with this idea of being a better iPhone. It's obnoxious, if you ask me.. Because HTC is run by idiots.. HTC should've focused on pushing the 10 more and on the new Desire, forget the A9 series as a whole. Surprisingly, I saw people on the streets with the A9 (I just can't find a scenario where people would go like "I want an iPhone but I also like Android").. iphones always have lower specs than most phones and they cost 700+. I'd say the lower specs are justified in the case of the iPhone since their OS is more optimised for the few devices it has to support. But there's no justification for HTC and this device.. If by 'optimized' you mean 'disallows most background processes'.... HTC is getting closer and closer to 6 feet under.. No thx, was looking at a phone with a smaller form factor, rather pay more and get the HTC 10 which is actually smaller and has a bigger screen, or heck newly announced Huawei Nova has a smaller body same screen and better specs. Just want something close to how the iPhone 6S feels in hand compared to how big my 6P or iPhone 6s Plus.. I like the A9, it was just too expensive for what you got (IMO). The fact that they're making an A9s variant with such a different SoC, which will cost less to make, so that they can sell it for less, is a scary place to be in. That tells me they're likely going to abandon further A9 production since it's not profitable, and if the A9s is more profitable and sells better since it's cheaper, then all of a sudden HTC has a $$ reason to show development favor (particularly with software updates) to the worse A9s rather than to the much better A9. Then all the folks who bought an A9 are up a creek since the software updates are catered to the P10 instead of the SD615.. HTC, makes great high end phones, but can't get the rest right to save their life. Downgrading and reselling last year's model isn't a good strategy, HTC. Being HTC isn't a good strategy, HTC.. Also, @Rita, the One A9 uses a Snapdragon 617, not a 615. May not sound like much of a difference, but being able to use all 8 cores at the same time as opposed to only one cluster or the other makes a big difference.. Absolutely nobody will buy this phone.

Is it upgradeable to Android 7 (Nougat)?. The Following User Says Thank You to dobrydiler For This Useful Post: [ View ]. I don't think this device will see any updates at all. I mean security patch level is from September 2016. The firmware on the device is the last one they provided to their beta testers ( I'm one as well). They managed to fix plenty of issues during those test months (weekly updates) but since release this device is forgotten. The Helio P10 can run Nougat fine, as seen on some Sony handsets with the same SoC. Join Date: Joined: Oct 2015.

SIM Only SIM Samsung Galaxy S7 black Apple iPhone 7 32GB black Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge black Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus black Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus rose pink Apple iPhone 7 32GB rose gold Samsung Galaxy S8 black Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge gold Samsung Galaxy S8 grey. The HTC One A9s is a smartphone well worth a review as it incorporates many premium features coupled with an extensive camera app. Priced from £13.50 per month on a 24 month contract, the HTC One A9s looks to be a star buy in the UK during 2017.. It is always a good idea to choose a phone that has a premium design married with durability, and the HTC One A9s is one such phone. The lightweight, thin and sleek metal frame has polished edges. Styling continues with diamond-like cut buttons and power button groves.. Latest review: Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 review. The dual-finish metal body has undergone extensive durability testing and has withstood hundreds of scratch and drop tests, along with hundreds of hours of extreme weather testing. The body is just 7.99mm thick and weighing 149.8 grams, this is one of the lighter smartphones that you will find during 2017.. The HTC One A9s has a 5” super LCD HD display (1280 x 720 pixels), which presents 294 pixels per inch. The display is protected behind Corning Gorilla Glass and above it sits a handy notification LED.. A 2GHz MediaTek Helio P10 octa-core processor provides a smooth and fast experience and consumers can choose between two levels of RAM and internal memory. The 16GB model gives the user 10.2GB of storage space and 2GB RAM. The 32GB model gives the user 24.5GB of storage space and 3GB RAM. Both models have a microSD card slot that can accommodate memory cards with a value of up to 2TB.. Call quality is assured through a dual microphone with noise cancellation and the bottom mounted speaker means that music isn’t muffled when the phone is placed onto a flat surface.. The HTC One A9s has an ultra-fast fingerprint scanner for security. The scanner recognises a finger pressed against it in almost any position or angle. The fingerprint scanner can be used to unlock the phone or unlock protected apps, which can be locked by using the App Lock function found in the Boost+ app.. To cater for all types of owners, the HTC One A9s also offers the option of pattern and PIN security. Users can also opt to use the Activate Smart Lock feature for unlocking the phone with facial recognition, although this isn’t quite as secure as the other methods.. Along with standard themes, the One A9s can use HTC Freestyle Layouts that break the restrictions of on-screen grids. With Freestyle Layouts you can place sticker, icons and widgets anywhere or link stickers to apps and remove app icons altogether.. You can also change the keyboard theme, re-sizing it, changing its background or splitting it into two, for typing with your thumbs. Bringing content from an old smartphone over is relatively easy through the restore function from Google or HTC backup. HTC Sync Manager can be used to get content moved over from an old iPhone.. Google’s Android 6.0 Marshmallow OS has been combined with the HTC Sense UI to deliver an interactive blend of features and apps.. On Google’s part, there is Google Now that can give automatic updates on things like the weather, traffic or sports results, while Now on Tap can present links to connected content on any screen or webpage.. On HTC’s side there is the HTC Sense Widget and this can change the home screen apps based upon what you use at home, at work or while on the go. HTC BlinkFeed is also pre-loaded and this can collate your news and social media activity for viewing in one place.. The Boost+ app keeps things running smoothly by allocating resources, clearing junk files, deleting the cache and maximising battery life by reducing the power consumption of background apps, that you haven’t used recently.. HTC announces U Play and U Ultra phones. Pro mode - Image files are saved in RAW format for complete editing control. Panorama mode - Pan to shoot up through 270-degrees. Continuous shooting - Capture four frames per second. Zoe Capture - Each photo is saved along with a three second HD video clip. Video Pic - Take 2MP quality photos while shooting video in Full HD. The high resolution 13MP camera has autofocus and a BSI Sensor for capturing low-light detail in the evenings. There is a LED flash for nighttime photography and a 74.4-degrees wide angle lens.. The first thing that is noticeable on the HTC One A9s is that it uses an improved and clear camera interface. This makes it much easier to switch between shooting modes and change settings.. The volume buttons can be configured to either activate the shutter or be set to zoom in or out. Moving objects in a scene can be tapped and the camera will then lock the focus onto them.. The 5MP portrait camera makes it easy to go hands-free. With Auto Selfie, the camera automatically takes shots when you smile or stand still. Voice Selfie lets you say ‘cheese’ or ‘capture’ to take a still picture or say ‘action’ or ‘rolling’ to begin recording Full HD 1080p video at 30 frames per second.. Live Makeup can be used to improve your complexion by smoothing out skin tones and by making further beautification adjustments. The 65.3-degrees wide angle lens gets more of the scene in the photo and if you wish, you can set an up to 10-seconds selfie timer.. The Google Photos app is pre-loaded and this offers Cloud storage for your videos and photos. The app has an easy search function and you can locate photos by face, object, theme or location, as well as making manual searches using keywords.. The 2,300mAh capacity battery isn’t the largest around but it does support fast charging and offers up to 13 hours of talk time or up to 432 hours of standby. When needed, power can be conserved by switching the HTC One A9s into Power Saver mode or Extreme Power Saving mode.. Next review: Alcatel Shine Lite review. Free HTC One A9s 16GB grey. 500 MB data.
