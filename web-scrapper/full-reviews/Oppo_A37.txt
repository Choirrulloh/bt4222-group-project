Please ask the question in above box. What is meant by VoLTE and OTG technology, and for which purpose we can use them?. VoLTE stands for Voice LTE as the network now provides calling facility through data. So, in some out-dated or old phones, it is necessary to turn ON the data connection to make or receive a call. But if your phone is VoLTE enabled, then you can make or receive a phone call even if the mobile data is turned off. OTG is used for attaching USB as external memory storage with a cable to your phone.. My phone has some heating problem, what can I do?. A lot of Oppo A37 users have complained about phone getting heated up, while playing graphic intensive games and recording videos. If you are gaming for a very long time, then I would suggest you stop playing demanding games like Asphalt or Modern Combat. Even though these games are designed to adjust performance according to your phone's GPU, they still end up demanding a lot.. a) backup your data, perform a factory reset and install only those apps that you plan to use regularly. Avoid installing multiple game apps and do not let them rest on your phone's memory.. b) If the phone gets heated up while charging, that's normal. But it gets scalding hot while ga. Play the game which you like to play at the same time. If we play all the games at the same time, the process may become slow and get heated according to the level of usage by a particular app. If we use an app for more than few hours or the game that demand us, we must set limitation and usage of games. For example: If we're playing Asphalt we must have to set an hour, and we must set a task for yourself that we can complete it before 70days. If you're experiencing overheat issue, you may have to use the app with the usage that your phone controls to stay. You can keep in a cool place to reduce heat. I hope you got some best answer.. Is it better than Oppo A33F?. Oppo A33 has 1GB RAM, but A37 has 2GB RAM.. The camera clarity is also better.. And lastly, very important thing, A37 supports VoLTE.. What is the megapixel of the rear camera of this phone?. As far as the cameras are concerned, the Oppo A37 packs an 8-megapixel primary camera on the rear and a 5-megapixel front shooter for selfies.. Does it have a hybrid SIM slot?. No, it has a dedicated slot.. 3 Ratings 2 Reviews. 5 1. 4 1. 3 0. 2 0. 1 1. Rate & review this product and help other customers.

Prices were updated today i.e., 26th February 2018.. Seller(s) of Oppo A37 Latest Price OnlyMobiles Rs. The A-series by Oppo is primarily focused at producing good budget range smartphones. These phones appeal to those who are looking to get the best value for their buck. The Oppo A37 was made official globally around June 20th of 2016 and has pretty much everything that you would expect from a moderately powerful Android phone today. Display & Design The Oppo A37 comes with a 5-inch display with 720P resolution. This is an IPS LCD panel, so the colours are true and have good legibility outdoors. Despite being a strictly budget phone, there is a 2.5D curved edge on the phone, something that we have seen on flagship phones like HTC 10 and iPhone 6s. There is also Gorilla Glass 4 on the top, ensuring that your display is well protected. In terms of the design overall, the A37 comes with a candy bar design that is fairly common today. Clear to see, Oppo has taken inspiration from iPhone 6 while designing this device. The edges are nicely rounded and you have neat rounds along the corners too. Hardware and Features The Oppo A37 is powered by Snapdragon 410 chipset, and there is 2GB RAM to assist the chipset in order to help you breeze through your tasks. With the combination, you should not expect the phone to play heavy games very well, but it should be able to hold up on its own for the regular day to day tasks. There is no fingerprint scanner here. On the software front, the A37 is still running the dated Android version 5.1, though there is ColorOS 3.0 on top, which sure adds some interesting features. Camera & Storage The rear camera on the phone is an 8MP sensor. This is a f/2.2 aperture lens, which at least on paper does not look very enticing. The rear camera is capable of creating a 24MP image using the Ultra HD mode on the phone. The front-facing camera is a 5MP sensor with f/2.4 aperture. The 1.4-micron pixel size on the front is really good for your selfie needs. There is also a screen flash on the phone. The Oppo A37 comes with 16GB internal storage, though you do have a dedicated slot for expanding the storage via a MicroSD card.
