Bought for a retail price of Rs 8100 this lenovo phone is superior to other lower mid range phones.. By Aravind M | 8 Oct 2016. Bought for a retail price of Rs 8100 this lenovo phone is superior to the lower mid range phones of the price range (Rs 7000-8000) considering its main competitor is Xiaomi Redmi series and they have much less number of service centres in India. (It's not very cool to travel 350 kilometers to get your Rs 7000 phone fixed, believe me). Headphone and screen protector was included.. Bear in mind that I'm reviewing it keeping in mind other similarly priced phones, not ones like Samsung's overpriced "bombs"..... Internal Storage - 16GB, around 10.6GB of which is available for the user. Processor - 1 GHz Quad core Mediatek 6735. Os - Android 5.1 L upgradable to Android 6.0 via OTA with Vibe UI 2.0 on top.. 720p 5.0 inch IPS LCD display. Good color reproduction, nothing bad in that regard.. Sunlight legibility at medium brightness levels was just ok, but was good at maximum brightness.. The UI is clean and neat very similar to vanilla/stock Android except for the app icons. Everything is presented cleanly with very cluttering. Two launchers can be chosen, out of which I found Google now to be better. Google bloatware that come preinstalled can be Disabled. Apps like Evernote and Truecaller are useful while those like ShareIT seem to have been replaced by Zapya and Xender among people these days, but that is subjective.. Speakers were back facing and good. Through headphones there was depth but the bundled headphones is just not good enough - better fitting ones should've been provided.. Rear Camera - 8MP with 720p 30fps recording with EIS (Electronic image stabilization). Image quality was commendable with good amount of detail and just a fair amount of noise.. Macro shots and HDR were great for an 8MP device. Auto focus was fast and accurate most of the time.. Video - Quality was usable with notable edge over-sharpening. The image stabilization feature is handy and is a good plus point. Changing focus while recording had negative effects like sudden change in brightness, etc.. Front Camera - 2MP with 480p 60fps(???) recording.. Below average with a lot of noise, lack of detail and whitened appearance.. Video - again below average, and is just OK for video calls.. What you would expect from a phone of this price range. Real world experience is satisfying if you're not a power user.. AnTuTu benchmark returned a score of 23,600 which is okay is for a lower mid range phone and beats Redmi2 prime by around 2000.. Battery capacity looks OK at 23000 MAh, but the charging speed leaves a lot to be desired. 3G and 4G was not tested.. Overall a good buy if you're on a tight budget and can't afford a 10k phone (Redmi note 3) or wait for online sites to deliver (k5 plus). Good move by lenovo to launch it with 4G LTE capability when Reliance JIO is the talk of the town.... Was this review helpful? Yes No. 4 out of 7 people found this review helpful. Bought Lenovo A6600 plus, 4 weeks ago. It is in service center from 3 weeks now. By Rajkumar Pusuluri | 30 Apr 2017. If you want a good service, dont buy Lenovo. The worst service experience I ever had.. Bought Lenovo A6600 plus for Rs.8000, 4 weeks ago but didnt use it for atleast 10 days. Battery is discharging completely in 1 hour. Took it to the service center and it has been 3 weeks.. Now they said it is Mother board problem. It will take atleast another 3 weeks.. Instead of showing a solution, customer service center employees are behaving rude.. So I paid Rs.8000 and am phoneless now.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. By kiran kumar | 13 Feb 2017. i Purchased Lenovo a6600 plus lost 4 months back....its have 4g and LTE ie k but Charging is not preparable whenever i am using internet in this its fastly decreses the charging and browsing speed is very much slow,,,,,if anyone want to buy this mobile first you will checkout above details if ok then purchase.

Good Stuff Good value for money smartphone Sharp display Decent performance from MediaTek MT6735P chipset 8MP Primary camera is nothing to brag about but does its job adequately Bad Stuff Battery life is mediocre UI is unrefined and filled with bloatware. For the first time in India, Lenovo has partnered with Reliance Jio communications to launch the three VoLTE enabled smartphones including the Lenovo A6600 Plus. The A6600 Plus aims at high-quality VoLTE (voice over LTE) voice calls.

The Lenovo A6600 Plus, unlike the A6600, comes with 2GB of RAM which is resourced by MediaTek MT6735P processor. The chipset used contains a quad-core configuration with a clock speed of 1GHz. Lenovo has not compromised on storage as there is 16GB of internal memory and an option to use microSD card for additional storage.. The entry-level Lenovo A6600 Plus does not surprise in the imaging department as it comes with a basic 8-megapixel and 2-megapixel camera configuration. The 8MP autofocus primary camera is equipped with dual-LED flash while the secondary camera has a very low-resolution of 2-megapixel. The cameras on the Lenovo A6600 Plus are only suitable for bare-minimum photography.. The operating system in the Lenovo A6600 Plus is an Android 6.0 Marshmallow which has been customised in terms of looks and functionality with the Lenovo’s VibeUI. There has been information from Lenovo whether this device will get the Android 7.0 Nougat or not. There are although very fewer chances of receiving an upgraded Android version as this an entry-level device.. The circular chrome garnish on the camera hump on the back of the device gives it a distinct look while the soft rubbery matte finish on the removable back panel gives it a very grippy hold in the hands. The removable back panel also houses the embossed Lenovo brand mark and a speaker grill at the bottom. The front of the device is simple; it houses three physical capacitive touch navigation buttons.. The Lenovo A6600 Plus comes with a 5-inch HD display with IPS technology. Lenovo has been providing the devices with decent quality displays, and this device is no different..

Information about some specific features related to the SIM card(s) of the device.. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) was developed to replace the analog cellular network (1G), therefore it is referred to as a 2G mobile network. It has been improved with the addition of General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) and later via the Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) technology.. UMTS stands for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System. Based on the GSM standard, it is deemed as a 3G mobile network standard. It has been developed by the 3GPP and its major advantage is the provision of greater bandwidth and spectral efficiency, due to the W-CDMA technology.. LTE is deemed to be the fourth generation (4G) of mobile communications technology. It has been developed by the 3GPP based on the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies in order to increase the speed and capacity of wireless data networks. A further development of the technology is called LTE Advanced.. There are several network technologies that enhance the performance of mobile networks mainly by increased data bandwidth. Information about the communication technologies supported by the device and their respective uplink and downlink bandwidth.. Information about the operating system used by the device as well as its version.. Name and version of the user interface (UI) used by the operating system (OS).. The SoC integrates different hardware components such as the CPU, GPU, memory, peripherals, interfaces, etc., as well as software for their functioning.. Information about the process technology used in manufacturing the chip. The value in nanometers represents half the distance between elements that make up the CPU.. CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors.

Pada Oktober 2016, Lenovo merilis tiga smartphone sekaligus, yakni Lenovo A6600, Lenovo A6600 Plus, dan Lenovo A7700. Kali ini kita akan berbicara salah satu diantaranya, yakni Lenovo A6600 Plus. Seperti halnya dua smartphone Lenovo A series lainnya, Lenovo A6600 Plus ini dibekali dengan konektivitas 4G LTE dan dibesut dengan harga murah meriah.. Meski murah dan menyasar pasar entry-level, Lenovo A6600 Plus dibesut dengan desain menawan. Spesifikasi dan fitur yang dimiliki smartphone ini juga cukup bagus dan berkualitas. Dengan embel-embel plus di belakangnya, Lenovo A6600 Plus memang memang mirip dengan Lenovo A6600, namun tetap memiliki spesifikasi yang lebih bagus. Lenovo A6600 ini dibesut dengan layar IPS LCD 5 inci dengan resolusi HD 720 x 1280 piksel. Smartphone ini juga telah menjalankan sistem operasi OS Android 6.0 Marshmallow.. Lenovo A6600 Plus ini memiliki sejumlah keistimewaan yang membuatnya layak untuk dimiliki. Desainnya apik dan cukup nyaman digenggam dalam satu tangan. Smartphone ini juga memiliki performa yang apik, dengan ditenagai chipset MediaTek MT6735P quad-core Cortex A53 berkecepatan 1Ghz. Lenovo A6600 Plus juga telah memiliki RAM 2GB dan penyimpanan internal 16GB yang masih bisa ditingkatkan hingga 32GB sebagai memori tambahan.. Lenovo A6600 Plus cukup menarik dengan kelebihan konektivitas 4G LTE yang dimilikinya, mengingat smartphone ini menyasar pasar entry-level. Selain 4G LTE, penggunanya adapat menggunakan jaringan 3G dan 2G untuk mengakses internet. Smartphone ini juga didukung dual-SIM yang dapat digunakan secara bersamaan. Sektor kamera Lenovo A6600 Plus juga cukup mumpuni. Lenovo membenamkan kamera utama berkapasitas 8MP, lengkap dengan dukungan autofikus dan LED flash. Kameranya juga mendukung perekaman video full HD 1080 x 1920 piksel yang akan disukai oleh Anda yang hobi mengabadikan momen video berharga. Adapun baterai Lenovo A6600 Plus berkapasitas 2,300 mAh yang bisa digunakan sebagai pasokan daya seharian.. Kamera depan berkekuatan 2MP sepertinya menjadi kekurangan Lenovo A6600 Plus ini. Selain itu baterai smartphone ini bersifat non-removable atau tidak bisa dilepaskan dari cangkangnya, sehingga penggunanya harus membawanya ke tempat service jika terjadi masalah.
