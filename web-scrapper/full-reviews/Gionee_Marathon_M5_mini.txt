Mobiles / Gionee Mobile Phones / Gionee Marathon M5 mini Price in India. User Visits: 3 Launch Date in India: 20 May, 2017 Compare. Gionee is one of the Chinese handset maker that has launched more impressive smartphones in Indian market than any other brand. Its Elife E, Elife S and Marathon series of smartphones have set the benchmark higher for existing handsets. The Marathon series of smartphones is known for its massive battery backup. The Gionee M5 smartphone is a part of the Marathon series and is known for its battery backup.. The design of the handset is more in line with the modern smartphones with its dual-tone color combination and sleek profile. The dual color palette on the rear panel of the handset comes with matte finish for enhanced elegance. Both volume and power buttons on the handset is located on the sides of the handset for convenience.. Gionee has equipped the new handset with a massive 5-inch display , which is neither small nor huge and is a right size to enjoy multimedia. The resolution offered by the display is pegged at HD viz. However, this means that due to big size and lower resolution, the display has lower pixel density and that is a downside. The display is also protected by a Corning Gorilla Glass 3.. The device is designed to offer decent performance to its users since it comes with a modest Quad-core processor that has a commendable 2 GB of RAM. We have already mentioned that the highlight of Marathon series of smartphone is the powerful battery and the M5 device boasts of a jaw dropping 4000 mAh battery that can last a whole day or two in a stretch.. The handset comes with a powerful 8 MP primary camera housed on its rear panel that can capture impressive images. It boasts of integrated features like Geo-tagging, touch focus, face/smile detection and panorama. This handset comes with a front facing 5MP camera that will definitely appeal to selfie lovers.. Gionee has equipped this handset with standard connectivity options such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and microUSB port. However, one of the downside of the handset is the absence of 4G LTE, which does not make any sense at a time when 4G is being enabled throughout the country. On a lighter note, the handset does comes with 3G connectivity , which is slightly slower than 4G.. Gionee has designed the Marathon M5 smartphone with the sole intention of offering a handset that can last atleast two days at a stretch. In case you are a heavy user and looking for a handset with marathon battery and can compromise a little on performance, this is the right device for you.. 3 /5 (3 User Reviews). 8,990 (Expected Price) Gionee Marathon M5 mini is currently not available in any online store..
