Roydon Cerejo , 02 November 2015. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Sony's mobile division has been in a rut for a while. If IDC's latest report is anything to go by, dominance by the likes of Huawei and Lenovo is only adding to the company's woes. Rather than sticking with the standard formula of yearly refreshes, Sony decided a few years ago to try bi-annual refreshes in order to keep things exciting and hopefully drive up sales. Sony Xperia Z5 Dual in pictures. Our last outing with Sony's flagship smartphone was the Xperia Z3+ ( Review | Pictures ) , which didn't exactly blow our socks off. This was just three months ago, and today, we already have its successor in the form of the Xperia Z5 Dual. Our first encounter with the phone was at IFA 2015 where the company announced it along with its two siblings - the Xperia Z5 Premium and Xperia Z5 Compact. ( Also read: Sony Xperia Z5, Xperia Z5 Compact, Xperia Z5 Premium First Impressions ). The Xperia Z5 Dual is on sale right now at Rs. 52,990 and will compete with flagships such as the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge , Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and Apple iPhone 6s , to name a few. Sony is also in competition with itself here as its previous flagship is virtually identical to its new offering on paper and retails for a lot less now. Let's see if the company has managed to fix the nagging issues we had with the old model which could nudge prospective buyers into taking the leap this time around.. Look and feel The Sony Xperia Z5 Dual looks practically identical to its predecessor, which is something we like. The phone is a tiny bit thicker at 7.3mm and a tad heavier too at 154g. The rounded edges are less pronounced, so the phone fits in your hand better. The metal frame is still very slippery though and the phone can easily slide from your fingers.. In the front, we have a 5.2-inch full-HD IPS display with scratch-resistant glass. Thankfully, Sony has done away with the silly screen guard on the display, which spoiled the otherwise premium look of the Xperia Z3+. There's a front-facing 5-megapixel camera, the usual suite of sensors, and a notification LED in the upper left corner. You also get stereo speakers placed on the top and bottom, facing you.. The phone retains its IP68 certification making it dust and water resistant. The slots for the two SIM cards and the microSD card are on the left, covered by a flap.. The power button has been redesigned with an integrated fingerprint sensor so it's flat and sits flush with the body instead of the older circular design. The volume rocker is still inconveniently located on the lower right side, which means you have to shuffle the phone about to reach it with one hand. The camera shutter button sits just below it.. Sony has gone with a frosted glass for the back, which looks and feels really good. It also attracts fewer fingerprints and is easier to keep clean. Here we have the new 23-megapixel camera and its single LED flash, followed by some branding and the NFC logo. Sony is probably one of the few phone manufactures to still include an eyelet for a lanyard.. The Xperia Z5 Dual is a very pretty phone. The gold variant that we received looks particularly good and will certainly turn a few heads. We didn't get a retail unit so the headset was missing, but the charger and cable that come with it are made well and should last.. Specifications and software The spec sheet of the Xperia Z5 Dual is virtually identical to that of its predecessor. The phone is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 SoC, and has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage (expandable up to 200GB). You also get Wi-Fi b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.1, USB OTG, GLONASS, NFC, FM radio, and a 2900mAh battery. The phone also has dual-SIM support with LTE for both SIM slots. It's nice to see Sony adding this functionality to its flagship models. The E6683 variant sold in India supports LTE for Band 40 and 3 but only up to Category 4 (150Mbps). The single SIM variant (E6653) supports LTE Category 6 but that hasn't been launched here. This is a bit disappointing since most other Android flagships today support the faster LTE specification.. USB OTG support is present but will only work if you tap 'Detect USB device' in the USB section of the Settings app, else your flash drive won't show up in file managers.. The fingerprint sensor is easy to set up and works as you'd expect. Since it is on the side, you'll most likely to use your thumb if you're right-handed or an index/ middle finger if you're left-handed. The placement of the button is good, however since it's flat, it can be a little tricky to find at night. The volume rocker and camera shutter buttons on the other hand operate as usual.. The phone supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge 2.0 and ships with the UCH10 charger which supports output at 5v, 9v and 12v. We tested this by charging the phone for 30 minutes when the battery was bone-dry. We repeated it with the phone switched on and off, and the battery was charged up to exactly 26 percent each time. This should be enough to get you through at least your morning commute to work.. Sony ships the Xperia Z5 Dual with Android 5.1.1 and its custom skin layered on top. You'll find glimpses of the stock interface but it's mostly customised to pack in all of Sony's enhancements. Most of them are similar to what we've already seen in the Xperia Z3+ but we'll skim over the notable ones here.. Themes lets you change the icons and look of the interface, but there isn't much choice and the good ones are usually paid or not available for India. The Display sub-menu lets you toggle Sony's image enhancements,. Enabling this simply boostscolour saturation which gives pictures and videos a very unnatural look.. The Audio sub-menu offers a ton of customisations for listening to audio through headphones. There's something called DSEE HX which helps up-sample low-resolution audio files. It's useful if you have a lot of these in your music library but is otherwise best turned off as it has a negative effect on high-quality files. You'll want to leave ClearAudio+ enabled as it boosts the low and mid-range frequencies in audio.. Sony also bundles its own suite of apps and adds plenty of functionality to existing Android apps. The album app for instance neatly organises your pictures and videos so you can sort them based on favourites, geo-tagged location, camera effects, faces, or people in your home network. There's also Facebook, Picasa and Flickr integration. Similar functionality is also found in the file manager and music apps. Finally, Smart Connect lets you automate things based on events or which accessories you use with the phone.. Along with the useful stuff, the phone is also burdened with unwanted bloatware that, thankfully, can be uninstalled. There are trial versions of games such as Real Football 2015, Thor, and Modern Combat 5; there's Hungama Play for renting movies and Jive for streaming music; News from Sociallife is a news aggregator; Sony Liv lets you watch local Sony Television shows once registered; and What's New lets you purchase themes, games, console games and music. You also get Kindle, Clean Master, AVG Protection, File Commander, Sony Lifelog, Sketch, Live Screen Streaming, Movie Creator, OfficeSuite, TrackID and PlayStation store pre-installed.. Sony is running a few offers with the phone which can be claimed through the Xperia Lounge app. You can claim a Smart Cover for the phone, plus download content worth Rs. 4,000 from the preinstalled Hungama Play and Jive apps.. Performance The Xperia Z5 Dual is a true workhorse and steamrolls over anything your throw at it. The only time we noticed some lag was when using the augmented reality (AR) camera apps. Call quality is good and so is the audio from the earpiece. The raised edges on the bezel of the phone help protect the display and frosted glass on the back from scratches when placed on a flat surface. However, they also make the phone a little difficult to hold and can get uncomfortable if you're on a long call. The display has good brightness levels, and colours are punchy. It does wash out a bit under direct sunlight, but is otherwise very legible for the most part. For a flagship phone as per today's standards, the resolution is a little low, but at 5.2-inches, full-HD is still enough to make pixels indistinguishable to the naked eye.. Sadly, the phone still heats up very quickly with even trivial tasks. We noticed that it started getting hot around the NFC logo on the rear, even when taking no more than two pictures. This was noticeable even in an air-conditioned room and it only got worse when we used the camera or played games outdoors. With the kind of weather we usually have to deal with in India, be prepared to carry a hot slab of metal in your pocket.. The stereo speakers are a marked improvement from earlier Xperia Z models. Incoming notifications and calls are clearly audible and the volume level is loud enough for music or videos. The sound quality is not the best but we won't fault Sony too much here since they had to go through some level of waterproofing. With headphones, the audio quality is simply superb. Since we didn't get a bundled set, we tested this with a pair of Cowon EM1 earphones and were very pleased with the results. The highs and mids are very detailed and there's a very satisfying thump in low frequencies too. You can customise this further by tinkering around with the EQ settings to suit your taste.. The phone posted some impressive scores in synthetic benchmarks. We got 50,872 points in AnTuTu and an impressive 52fps in GFXbench. 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited threw up a score of 25,020 which is higher than what the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 managed. The scores varied quite a bit depending on how hot the phone was so we had to let it cool down before getting the desired result. This strong performance is reflected in real-world apps too, and taxing games such as Dead Trigger 2 played without a hitch.. (Click to see full-size image) The Xperia Z5 Dual gets a new 23-megapixel camera sensor which performs well under most lighting conditions. In daylight, landscapes and macro shots have very good detail and colours captured are quite accurate. You also get a very satisfying depth-of-field effect in close-up shots. The dedicated shutter button comes in handy for quickly launching the camera app and snapping pictures. Landscapes and close-up shots pack in good detail with accurate colours. Low-light shots are also decent but there's a noticeable purple hue in dark areas of the picture. The phone heats up rather quickly and you'll get warning messages every now and then that the app might close in the event the phone gets too hot. In fact, you'll be inclined to stop shooting pictures way before the app can close as the phone gets uncomfortable to hold beyond a point.. (Click to see full-size image) We noticed that the phone takes about a second or two from the time you press the shutter to when the image is actually saved. This is a rather slow when you compare the near-instantaneous post-processing of the Galaxy Note 5 or the iPhone 6. It also explains why Sony has quietly removed burst mode from the camera app. Even the 'Timeshift Burst' add-on is which was present by default in previous offerings, is absent. We found 'Superior Auto' to be the best mode to shoot in. You can choose 'Manual' to select the type of scene but you'll have to drop the resolution to 8 megapixels to use it. We would have liked a professional mode which lets you control the aperture and shutter speed. Sony is reportedly planning to overhaul the camera app so hopefully, we'll see these features added to the new layout.. With 5x digital zoom (Click to see full-size image) Sony is also touting its 'Clear Image Zoom' feature, which is supposed to deliver clear pictures even with a 5x zoom. In reality, this works to an extent but pictures are noticeably less sharp and colours get muted. The front-facing 5.1-megapixel camera does a good job at selfies under natural light but indoors, under artificial lighting, pictures get a little noisy. Video recording quality is also good and you can switch between full-HD 30fps and 60fps. The phone does a good job with 4K video recording as well, with good detail and a steady frame rate.. Coming to battery life, the Xperia Z5 Dual packs in just a tiny bit less capacity than its predecessor. The phone lasted around 10 hours and 47 minutes in our video loop test, which is more than what the Xperia Z3+ achieved. Withregular use, we easily managed to go a little more than a day before having to turn on the Stamina or Ultra Stamina modes. Sony's battery saving modes continue to be some of the best out there, and really help to prolong battery life even when the levels are critically low.. Verdict Sony's new flagship comes just a few months after its previous flagship so we didn't expect much to change and truth be told, very little has. Sure, it is slightly better looking and the battery life has improved a bit, but you'd have to be a die-hard Sony fan to pay this much for it, especially when there are much better alternatives going for a whole lot less.. The Xperia Z5 Dual feels like a forced update from Sony given the phone is nearly spec-for-spec identical to the Xperia Z3+, which wasn't a show-stopper begin with. In order to compensate for this, Sony is throwing in some limited time freebies to tempt buyers but we're not sure how well that will work out.. For this money, you can get the Samsung Galaxy S6 64GB, which is a much better all-rounder. If you want to spend a bit less without compromising anything, then how about the Huawei Google Nexus 6P 64GB for Rs. 42,999? Our initial impressions of the phone are positive, and we'll have a full review of it soon.. The Sony Xperia Z5 Dual would have made a great flagship a year ago, but with the competition being fiercer than ever, it simply feels dated. Even if you go purely by specifications, the phone is underwhelming compared to others in its price range and even lower. Plus, the overall experience doesn't really bring anything new to the table and we still have to live with the shortcomings of previous Xperia flagships. What we need from Sony is something fresh; something to get excited about again. Until that happens, it's back to the drawing board..

Please ask the question in above box. I am a great Sony product user. I bought Xperia neo V, it was a great phone for me, and it's still working. Seeing that performance I preferred an upgrade, so I bought Z2 putting 45K INR, but within 15 months it crashed out. When I went to a service station, they said it'll cost me around 20-25K INR. So I exchanged that phone for Xperia Z5 dual. Now it's hardly six months old; the phone hangs a lot. Battery life is less you need 3-4 hour to get it fully charged, but it'll take only two hours to reach 10%.. A flagship phone has to offer more than good.. No lag experiences, satisfying sound and camera performance, battery lasts at least for 5 hours.. It depends on what you are looking for. If you ask me, I will choose Z5 over iPhone 6 because I have always been a fan of Sony.. Not too good and not too bad.. My mark for this phone is 7 out of 10... Good but after nougat update battery is draining too fast.. Does it have a gorilla glass?. No, it has an IPS display.. Does it have a fingerprint sensor?. Yes, it has finger print sensor, but please don't buy any Sony phone because they are the worst phones I have ever used.. Yes, it has embedded fingerprint sensor on the right-hand side.. Sony Xperia Z5 Dual has a fingerprint sensor.. The Indian version has finger print sensor. Yes, it has but doesn't work properly.. Which camera is better iPhone 6 or Sony Xperia z5 dual?. Sony Xperia z5 is better .....In iPhone 6 photos will be good only when seen it on a iPhone mobile.. IPhone 6 have better camera in low light conditions but in natural lighting z5 is a clear winner.. Both have good cameras but I would suggest you not to buy Z5 now because it is too old now.. I have not used iPhone 6, but photo quality of sony is very very good, clear and vivid.. Iphone is far better than sony, it's camera lens gets blured after 1 to 2 months.. User Reviews of Sony Xperia Z5 Dual. 1 Ratings 0 Reviews. 5 0. 4 0. 3 0. 2 0. 1 0.

NO, because to me this phone is an allrounder, something which the s6e lacks. Overall Design I dont like using covers so with the s6e i was always.... well on edge when holding it. I did however find it more comfy to hold than a standard s6 thus me getting the edge. The camera protrudes out and that is something that i really hate as I can see that part wearing out or being damage first. The edges do look pretty cool though. The z5 is lovely to hold in the hand. Camera is flush and I no longer worry placing it anywhere. The frosted glass is really nice, though I will be putting a glass protector on it. While the s6e is unique in a way the z5 does hold on its own, very decent looking handset. Finger print sensor Even before it was announced on the z5 I had wished the sensor was on the side as I would always be activating the s6e button when taking it out of the pocket. I mostly hold the phone with the left hand so while holding the phone naturally in my hand I can easily unlock it with my finger. Greatly missed the double tap to open feature on the s6e. This compliments well with the sensor. Screen Things esp taken photos do look better on the s6e. But he z5 is pretty good too no complaints. Dual sim I believe its the best dual sim you can get. One annoyance is though when having to switch which is the data sim. You have to also switch which sim is to be on lte, as the other can only be on gsm. Hope can get tasker to do some automation. I'm no expert but s6e does seem better in taking a good quick snap. From what I read online you need to configure hr settings more for a good shot on the z5, something I will invest time in. Heat The z5 does get fairly warm. Recorded a 1min 4k vid and while it does warm up a fair bit it doesn't go beyond a certain point. It's mild winter here so will be interesting to see how the z5 holds up in summer. As it should be from a high end device. The s6e still plagued my the memory leak. I had to put a custom rom to improve things. He z5 works great out of the box, as it should. Color Superb uniform color which I love. s6e, under certain angles/lighting conditions it looks awesome, but not so much under certain angles. Charger It came with crappy earphones and a standard charger. I got the Aukey Quick Charge 2.0 for it. Overall The s6e was an impulse buy. The z5 is a smarter buy imo. It may not be the best in any single department but as an allroudner its a clear winner to me. FYI, according to official specs the dual z5 thickness is 7.4mm, the single sim z5 is at 7.3mm. Also to the other reviewer staying its a scam, how is it so? You are spamming the same message elsewhere too. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Overall 5 stars because I love the design sooooo much. Overall 5 stars because I love the design sooooo much! 1. In my opinion it's the best designed sony cell phone. fingerprint reader location is very good, much better than the back around the camera. NFC, hand strip loop and even radio function, these old fashion features are the reason why I love it. But this model has some flaws, which I know before purchasing. the 810 processer makes this phone very hot and use the battery very quick. I cannot even hold the phone for long-term videos. screen is polarized :) when I drive with my polarized sunglasses, I could not see anything on the screen if I landscape the phone. camera is ok but not compatitive to the same year samsung galaxy S/Note or iPhone or google pixel. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars SONY MAKES OTHER ELECTRONICS LOOK CHEAP :-). Love the Sony Xperia line of smartphones and tablets AND THE PlayStation PS1, PS2 AND the PS3 which I currently own and still have a PS2! Have owned 2 other Xperia phones the Z1 and Z2, both of those broke due to my breaking them... OOPS! But now I bought the Xperia Z5 and I love it! Ended up staying with the "Z" model lineup because the new "X" and "XA" models just did not have the features and price that worked for me. WATERPROOF WATERPROOF WATERPROOF!!!! LOVE the SONY BRAND! Will be purchasing more Sony electronics in the future. Really want an Xperia Z5 Tablet now too, and maybe the VAIO PC and a Smart TV by Sony. In my opinion, Sony is on top of the electronics food chain LOL!. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars I love my new Sony. I love my new Sony!

Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars BATTERY WITH. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Did I pay US$719.98 for a "lemon" Sony Xperia Z5 Dual E6683 3GB/32GB 23MP 5.2" 4G LTE Smartphone (Green) ???. The cell phone has too many flaws: 1, the flash light turns on by itself. 2, the phone freezes by itself. 3, the phone could not be turned off many times, when I wanted to for a faster re-charge. 4, the phone's "airplane mode" has turned on by itself quite a few times. 5, when restart the phone, it would do "update" almost every time. That is strange: why it needs update so often? I do not understand that. 6, the phone cannot get "4G" information. 7, the USB charger cannot be used in the United States. 8, the seller, Gotham's Cells, would not take it back. I had paid for US$719.98 for a "lemon" for three months?! I will contact Amazon.com to get it right. Was this review helpful to you?. What other items do customers buy after viewing this item?.

The best 1 Sony phone priced around Rs. Top 10 mobile phones in India. Review talking about - Read all Great camera Reviews. Sony Xperia Z5 Dual User Reviews. BASED ON 225 RATING(S). 25 Jan 2016 By yoganand n On flipkart.com. My favourites while selection were iphones 6s, galaxy s6 edge, g4, one m9 plus.n nPros:n1). Camera: z5's 23mp produces 100% pure natural colours in daytime. Its photo quality in auto mode is the best for daytime photos. Its wide lens produces very accurate images of objects even 35-40 metres away, as it got lossless image processing tech. I was bit worried the small flash won’t help even a bit for night photography. But Z5 produces marvellous images even in too low light (even in 20% of lighting). I compared my friends 6s, s6 with z5, and both can’t even match to 50% of this phones quality. This phone is the most best for wildlife photography. Took this phone for my friend’s wedding, and a highly reputed photographer from Bangalore who was doing the wedding coverage was amazed at z5’s camera quality after he clicked some pictures. Did 10mins of 4k recording with phone getting light warm (not hot). Get some image samples from internet and verify yourself. Never compare z5’s build with others. The phone gets warm on heavy usage, because of its tight packaging. It cools off immediately as it got heat pipes and thermal paste applied over processor. Battery: The phone was discharging very fast after 1st charge. Lasted only one day (may be due to firmware update). On 2nd charge, watched movie for 2.5 hours, listened to music for 4 hours, browsed for around 2 hrs, took around 9-10 snaps with flash and had a talk time of almost 45 mins, But phone had discharged to only 47 %. Battery lasts easily a day even on heavy usage. On slightly above normal usage it lasts 1.5 -2 days. In image it seems to be dull coloured. But in real, black is awesome. Sound: Phone got dual speaker both at the top and bottom (front of phone). The sound is very crisp and bass effect is good. Due to the speakers, the phone size is bigger.10/10n6). Display: The display is too crisp compared to other phones of same size. Performance: Since my first usage, none of the apps ever hanged. Played all high end games, but after playing for around 20mins, the phone gets warm to hot. But it cools down quickly once app is exited. Don’t go with benchmarking as this is a 3gb model. Only while updating phone for the first time, it heats up a lot.n2). Phone gets warm (not hot) on heavy usage.n3). Pricy but not too pricy when taken its feature into consideration. If govt reduces tax the phone might cost less.. 02 Nov 2015 By Kamal Kishore On flipkart.com. My seven days with this phone. Following are my observations/views:n1 Dual sim ( dual sim option is rare in High end phones in India) ( i bought because of this)n2 Premium lookn3 Heats up (it is made airtight for waterproofing) Software updates may improve heating issuesn4 Ringer is not so high. ( in traffic we may miss ringtones) Not an issuen5 Battery lasts for one day only even with 2G network ( may be improved by updates)n6 At software level features are not large as compared to Samsung phones of same leveln7 23 MP camera. (It has G Lens) It is not as great. 16 MP cameras from other phones may have good result over this.n8 It has dual sterio speakers ( top and bottom)n9 Sound quality is good.n10 Finger sensor works great. (at present we can not use app lock that uses finger sensor in this phone) However Android 6 (Marshmallow) will have finger sensor in OS. So third party application will be available n I will update my new experiences soonnnSecond Update:nI have been using Xperia Z5 Dual for the last 9 months:nn1. Marshmallow has opened its finger sensor to many third party applications. ( I am using Lockdown Pro for apps lock)n2. Camera quality is also increased.n5 Heating issue is not much.nnAs as whole phone is worth to buy ( price also slashed). It looks quite premium in hand. nI dont like four corners of the phone. The edges of corners from the back of the phone has given off their golden color.. Sony reveals Android Nougat update roadmap, coming to Xperia X Performance and Xperia XZ first.

Please note that this phone has 810 processor, any phone with 810 processor will heat up like hell but Z5 series uses thermal paste and liquid heat pipe to draw heat away from the processor so this phone has the least heating issues compared other 810 processor. This phone does get warm and cools down very quickly in standby but if you can neglect this issue than this processor is beast. But end of the day you'll end up loving the phone with design, great music quality and satisfying battery life and amazing fingerprint sensor!.

Phone and touch screen starts hanging within 6 months. And Sony India are big cheaters when it comes to service. I bought this Sony Xperia Z5 Dual just 9 months back. Had to be taken to service centre thrice already for hanging problem, touch screen problem & battery discharging issue. Sony India service centre denied warranty of battery giving unacceptable reason of - battery warranty is void as the corner of external cover has a small crack. And service of Sony India is even more pathetic. Do not go for Sony Xperia phones. We have far better, improved and yet reasonably priced phones available.

Sony Xperia Z5 Dual Sim Overview. Late to the market hardware wise. Great update but seems more of a too litte too late when it comes to timing.. The Xperia Z5 is the last line up of the Xperia Z series of smartphones. The Xperia Z and Z1 were the phones that brought back Sony to life with its amazing design and features, especially the waterproofing. Since then the Z lineup has improved bi yearly, making successive releases not much of an upgrade over the previous phone. The Z5 can be considered as the direct successor to the Z3+ and it brings a lot of changes in a new phone the Z lineup after a long time.. The Z5 dual maintains the same Sony design language, making it distinguishable as a Sony smartphone at first look. The size of the Z5 is actually identical to that of the Z3 and the weight is pretty much the same as well. Though when you take a closer look at the phone, there are changes which can help you spot that this is indeed an Z5 and not an Z3, like the placement of the stereo speakers on the front side. The phone is made of glass on both side and has a metal frame just like its predecessor, the only difference being the backside has now got a matte finish. With each passing model the number of flaps on the phone keeps reducing, the USB charging port has no flap, but it’s waterproof. The sim cards and SD card slots obviously need to be kept safe under a flap on the side. The new power button on the right side also has a fingerprint sensor. The sides of the phone are flat unlike the Z3 which had round sides, but the phone is still good to hold in the hands. The phone is really well built and has a premium feel, and that makes it the best Z series phone till now.. The Z5 sports a 23 MP rear camera, finally a change from the 20.7 MP camera sensors seen ever since the Z1. There is an LED flash as well, though dual LED would’ve been a welcome addition. The camera has 1/2.3 inch sensor with a maximum aperture of f/2.0 which means great low light photos. The autofocus is among the fastest among all smartphones thanks to phase detection autofocus system and the photos come with great natural colors. Although low light photos have noise in auto mode, the manual mode sort of addresses that. The front camera has finally received a bump in resolution, the 2.2 MP camera has now been replaced by a 5.1 MP camera.The letdown is that the front camera takes quite a bit of time to click a picture.The hardware shutter key has been a trademark among Z-series phones and it remains on the Z5 as well which is a delight.. The Z5 sports the same 5.2 inch 1080p IPS LCD panel as on the Z3. The X-reality engine and the Triluminos display means that the phone has a really good display. The display though has improved a lot in terms of brightness and sunlight readability. The contrasts have been improved as well thanks to deeper blacks. The screen is protected by scratch resistant glass with oleophobic coating which keeps fingerprints at bay.. The Z5 dual is powered by Snapdragon 810 octa core chipset and the Adreno 430 GPU. The phone has 32 gb internal storage of which 20 gigs is user available and the SD card slot supports expansion upto 200 GB. The phone comes with 3 gigs of RAM ensuring that the phone runs super smoothly in almost all cases. The SD 810 is dreaded for its heating issues, but the Z5 doesn’t really face much heating issues unless you’re using the camera for extended periods or recording 4K videos which is normal.. The Z5 dual comes loaded with Android 5.1.1 (Lollipop) with Sony’s Ui on top. The UI isn’t so heavy and retains a lot of the stock features making it the best proprietary UI you can find in any smartphone. Thanks to this the phone runs smoothly without and lag and you can expect an upgrade to Android 6.0 in the near future.. The Z5 dual has a non-removable 2900 mAh battery, which is actually a step down from the Z3 which had 3100 mAh. The support for quick charging 2.0 is a bonus here though, helping charge to 60% in 30 minutes. The phone gives an average battery life, and will last a day and some on moderate usage. The Stamina mode and power saving modes give the phone good standby times as well. The overall battery life has taken a hit here due to lesser capacity battery.. The Z5 is an Xperia that brings quite a lot of change to an Z series phone in a long time. The camera is great and among the fastest in the market. The processor though is something of a gamble here though you can always drop it in a tub of water if you ever feel it’s overheating. The fingerprint scanner is placed pretty neatly on the power button on the side and the build and design of the Z5 is top notch.. What is being discussed about mobiles.

Author Sandeep Sarma Posted on December 15, 2015 December 28, 2015 Categories Featured , Reviews , Sony. Sony Xperia Z5 Dual smartphone in. Great Build Quality and Attractive Design. Buttery Smooth Video Stabilization at 1080p 30fps. As someone who writes about smartphones and gadgets for a living, you are bound to have come across almost every device that releases in the market. In the case of the Sony Xperia family, I had the pleasure of not just using but owning almost every flagship device released in the Z family. This includes the Z, Z Ultra, Z1, Z2 and Z3 in that order.. The reason I got the Xperia Z was simple, it was waterproof. Ever since I was a kid, I had read about these waterproof phones available in Japan and that was something I always wanted to have on a phone. It was finally possible for people outside of Japan to own one and thats the main reason why I got it. The Xperia Z was disappointing in a number of ways but showed promise in a few others. You knew that Sony was on the right path but still had a lot of work to do. With every generation, they revealed something that was worth upgrading for me despite being released in such quick succession. With the Z1, it was the 20.7 Megapixel sensor. With the Z2, it was the bigger screen, 3GB of RAM and 4K video recording. finally with the Z3, it was the metallic design, the new colour choices and the fact that I had rendered my Z2 unusable after a small accident. The battery life too was one of the best on any smartphone on the Z2, Z3 and Z3 Compact. While other phone were struggling to make it past half a day, these phones would last you through till the next morning if needed.. Then Sony decided that they don’t want to release a new model twice a year but at the same time they did want to. This is how the Z3+ was born. While the jump from Z2 to Z3 wasn’t that big either especially in terms of specifications, it still brought about other changes that could possible entice some users. People expected a Z4 but they got a Z3+ which housed the Snapdragon 810 which at the time was more of a question mark after seeing the issues it caused on the HTC One M9 and LG G Flex 2. The battery capacity was reduced too and while the Z3 did perform as well or even better than the Z2 with a smaller battery capacity, that wasn’t the case with the Z3+. The final nail in the coffin was when Sony announced the device would be a Japan only model until further notice. Then Sony seemed to have a crisis of sorts as they announced the same Z3+ with a 1440p panel, a beefier battery and built-in wireless charging as the Z4v in America which would be an exclusive to Verizon. While things were confusing for both buyers and reviewers for sometime, things got clearer at IFA where they announced 3 new products to the Z series. The Z5, Z5 Compact and the Z5 Premium. The Z5 is a direct successor to the Z3+ and brings around quite a bit of changes to the table. It is probably the biggest jump in the Z lineup since the Z2 and does seem like it will put up a fair fight with competitors. Lets dive into the review to take a look at the device in detail.. We have already unboxed the Sony Xperia Z5. To check out the unboxing, watch the video below:. The contents of the box are:. As with every Z series smartphone so far, the Sony Xperia Z5 has a design that screams out Sony’s design language. In terms of footprint size, the Z5 measures the exact same as the Z3. The weight too remains almost the same but the Z5 is 2 grams heavier. Despite the similar sizes, the devices still look quite a bit different. For starters, the stereo speakers on the front have been re-arranged to match the position on the Z2 which we felt was better than the speaker positions on the Z3. The front and the back are majorly made of glass just like on the Z3 with a metal frame. However, the glass panel at the back now has a very matte soft touch finish compared to the glossy ones of the past Z series smartphones. The Z5 Premium on the other hand has a mirror finish at the back.. The front is dominated by the 5.2″ display. Above the display, you have the front facing camera, LED notification light, ambient light sensor, proximity sensor as well as the first speaker. Below the display, you find the second speaker grille which also houses the primary microphone.. At the top, you have the 3.5mm audio jack as well as the secondary microphone. At the bottom , you have the lanyard eyelet and the microUSB port which is not covered anymore. Sony first debuted the uncovered microUSB port with the M4 Aqua which was announced at MWC 2015. We had done a full-fledged test of it underwater both at the show floor as well as with our underwater photo gallery of the device. The same was introduced on the Z3+ and we are delighted to see it appear on the Z5 as well. It is fine to cover the microSD slot and the SIM slots since you don’t really need to access it all that often but the microUSB port is something you’ll need to use at least once a day. Many people have complained about the port flap breaking on their phones and as a result rendering the waterproofing ability of the phone useless. In this case, the chances of the port cover breaking are much lower so we welcome the change.. At the left side, you have a flap which houses the SIM tray and microSD card slot. The variant we have is the Dual SIM one. Depending on the region, you may get the single SIM or Dual SIM variants or both. At the right side, you have the new power button which also houses a fingerprint sensor. We will discuss more about that later on in a dedicated section. Below the power key, you have the volume rocker button and the two stage camera shutter button. While both the keys are sufficiently raised from the body and offer good feedback when pressed, the volume keys are positioned a bit too low for our liking. The position of the volume rocker isn’t where your thumb can easily access during a phone call for example and thus makes controlling the volume a bit harder and awkward than before.. All the four corners have protector caps as well. Moving over to the back, you have the primary camera at the top left corner. Below that, you find a single LED flash. There is a NFC logo towards the top, Sony branding in the centre and XPERIA branding at the bottom. The Z5 comes in White, Graphite Black, Gold and Green colours. We were hoping to see the Copper colour from the Z3 that we loved very much but that has been replaced by the Gold variant which we are reviewing. The Gold too looks nice but nothing as classy or unique as the Copper variant. Perhaps if you want something unique, you would be better off getting the Green one instead. The glass at the back is quite resistant to fingerprints thanks to the matte finish. It is also quite scratch resistant and during our time of testing, we were happy to observe that we didn’t get any scratches on the back.. The sides of the Z5 are quite flat unlike the Z3 which was quite rounded. However, it still quite easy to handle and doesn’t cause any discomfort to your hands as such. The matte glass at the back also provides quite a lot of grip too. The entire phone is built really well and gives a real “Premium” feel that makes it the best built phone in the Z series till date. The phone is IP68 certified for use in water upto 1.5 metres depth for a duration of 30 minutes. However, for some reason, Sony doesn’t seem as encouraging of users to use their phones underwater anymore as they were with previous generations. The Sony Xperia Z5 has a 5.2″ display with a resolution of 1080p. Add in Sony’s own technology such as the X-Reality engine and Triluminous display and you have quite a good display. The resolution and display remain the same since the Z2. However, there are several improvements to the display in terms of brightness and sunlight legibility mostly owing to a lesser reflective display itself. The resolution is good enough for the size and we didn’t face any issues with lack of sharpness in text or images. A 1440p panel would have brought it on par with most competitors as far as specifications are concerned however, it would’ve been an unnecessary drain on the battery life. Probably the biggest improvement is the contrast levels which are higher thanks to the deeper blacks. The display is protected by an unspecified scratch resistant glass with Oleophobic coating which seems to do a good job not just at protecting the display from scratches but also has reduced the fingerprint prone nature of the Z series phones of the past.. Coming to the software, the user can opt for a default display mode or go ahead with either an X-Reality Engine or a super-vivid mode. The X-Reality engine bumps up the saturation and contrast and so does the super-vivid mode but to a larger extent. Users can switch on glove mode in case they want to operate their smartphone using gloves. There is a white balance tool to tweak the display perfectly to your liking using the RGB sliders. The phone supports double tap to wake up but there is no option to lock the device using double tap. Finally, there is a smart backlight control mode where the phone recognises when you are holding it and makes sure that it stays awake and unlocked. Once you place it on a table for example, the device will go to sleep as per the time set by the user.. For the first time in the Z series, the Z5, the Z5 Compact and Z5 Premium all carry fingerprint sensors. The implementation is quite unique too as the fingerprint sensors are housed within the power key on the right side. Almost every other smartphone has a fingerprint sensor on the front within the home button or at the back, below the camera sensor. I personally prefer the fingerprint sensor to be within the home key but after using the Z5, I am quite liking the side implementation too. The ideal finger to register for the Z5 would be your thumb on the right hand and your index finger on your left hand as these are the fingers that will rest on the sensor when using on the right hand and left hand respectively.. However, you are free to register any fingerprint of your choice and you can register upto 5 fingerprints at a time. This could include, fingerprints of people you are close to as well. Registering a fingerprint is quite easy as the user just has to pick a finger, place it on the sensor, lift the finger and place it again when the phone vibrates. After detecting your finger multiple times, the fingerprint gets registered. You can choose to remove a fingerprint later on as well. The fingerprint sensor is quite sensitive and require you to just place your finger on the sensor but if the sensor or your finger is remotely wet or sweaty, it may not recognize it. There is a backup pin that users can set to unlock the phone when that happens.. As of now, the fingerprint sensor can be used to only unlock the device but we should see several more uses with it especially once the device gets Android 6.0 Marshmallow. In order to unlock the device, the user must first wake the device up either by pressing the power key or by double tapping the screen (if you have enabled that option). Then you can place your finger and unlock the device.. Audio quality is quite good for calls both over the earpiece as well as the speakers. Volume is good enough in all environments from the earpiece but may find it a bit low when in a noisy environment and you use the speaker. Your voice gets to the other end clearly thanks to the noise cancelling secondary microphone. Being a dualSIM phone, the user can easily pick the SIM to place the call with before making the call. The dial-pad is large and easy to use and read.. The Z5 comes pre-loaded with the Xperia keyboard that is quite easy to use and has a well spaced layout. You can definitely choose to install Google Keyboard or any other keyboard of your liking from the Play Store if needed as well. Just like with the case of the dialer, there are quick shortcuts that allow the user to select the SIM with which he/she wants to send the message across.. The Z5 comes pre-loaded with Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with Sony’s own UI on top. The UI layer isn’t too heavy and retains a lot of the stock Android features and layout. This also makes sure that the device performs smoothly without much lag or hiccups. The Z5 will most definitely receive the update to Android 6.0 Marshmallow in the near future.. Users have the ability to choose what system icons to be displayed on the notification bar at the top. Pulling it down, will show you the list of notifications as well as quick toggles and shortcuts. There is the user information as well as a day/date/time information and a brightness slider. Additionally, users can also change the themes to adjust the look and feel of their device. The Z5 comes pre-loaded with several different themes. If none of them are to your liking, you could always download additional ones online from their theme store.. The Z5 in India is the Dual-SIM variant which is a nice feature to have especially considering that hardly any flagships come with dualSIM support in India. Both the SIM card slots support 4G LTE and the phone takes 2 nanoSIM cards through the tray that is hidden behind the protective flap. The phone can have one card on LTE at a time while the other will move to 2G only mode.. Starting with the Z3+, Sony shifted to a single 32GB storage model and it remains the same with the Z5. Luckily the Z5 also retains the microSD card slot of its predecessors. microSD card slots are something of a rarity these days so it is definitely good to have. The device has around 20.81GB of free memory upon boot. It supports cards upto 200 GB in capacity as well. It also supports USB OTB so you can connect your external hard disks or USB drives when needed.. The Z5 has a microUSB port, Bluetooth 4.1 as well as support for dual-band WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac. It is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 chipset and has 3GB of RAM as well. As you would expect, the device performs quite well but isn’t the leader save for a few benchmarks. You can see a few benchmark results below but for the full-fledged benchmarks, visit this post .. The phone performs most tasks with ease and we didn’t have any issues with stuttering or lag. Heating too was kept under control except for when using the camera for extended periods or recording 4K. We did occasionally get warnings that the phone might turn off the camera if it gets too hot but it didn’t come to that. On some Z flagships in the past, the camera did that automatically without issuing a warning even. You can check out our benchmarks and gaming review video below to get a better idea about the performance.. The audio quality through earphones is one of the best we have seen in recent flagships. The clarity is really good and so is the volume. Even at maximum volume, there is no distortion and there is hardly any stereo crosstalk. The dynamic range is pretty good too and the bass feels strong but natural. The speakers on the other hand do disappoint a bit. Despite being stereo speakers, we feel that the clarity and loudness aren’t as good as we had hoped it would be and that is probably the major chink in the Z5’s armor.. Like most recent Sony phones, the music app is now simply called ‘Music’ instead of ‘Walkman’. It displays tracks that are stored locally on your device as well as integrates Spotify which you can choose to disable if needed. The tracks can be viewed according to songs, albums, artists, folders etc. The now playing screen offers the album art, track info as well as controls to seek/skip, play/pause the track. Users can also enable/disable shuffle and repeat. Additionally, there are options to play the songs externally on another device and even set a timer after which the music will stop playing. This would be useful for people who love listening to music before sleeping. You can also add the song to favourites/playlists, share it and even edit the track information.. The settings menu offers a wide range of tweaking and customization to provide the best acoustic experience possible. You can enable DSEE HX to convert the tracks to near Hi-Res audio quality if you are listening over headphones. There is an option for ClearAudio+ which basically increases the clarity of the songs. You can also choose the reverb effect to mimic a living room, studio or even a concert hall. The dynamic normalizer makes sure that the tracks are all of equal volume so that you don’t have to keep fiddling with the volume controls ever so often. There is an equalizer which you can choose presets from or tweak to your own liking. There are even settings for noise cancelling headphones or earphones. All in all, this is one of the most advanced music players available on a smartphone today and it really provides you the ultimate listening experience.. There is a built-in FM radio app that has a visualizer. You need to plug in your headphones or earphones which will act as an antenna after which you can either listen to the radio using earphones or the built-in speakers. You can choose your own region, visualizer and even make use of TrackID to immediately recognize the track that is being played.. The camera is one of the major changes in the Xperia Z5 compared to the previous Z flagships from Sony. The Z5 receives an upgrade from the 20.7 Megapixel sensor that Sony has been using since the Z1. The new 23 Megapixel sensor is 1/2.3″ in size and has a maximum aperture of f2.0.. The autofocus is one of the fastest on any smartphone right now and the amount of detailing is good too. Colours are quite natural with good white balancing as well. The performance is good in well-lit conditions however noise does creep in during low light conditions especially in auto mode. You can overcome that by manually selecting a lower ISO which does the trick in most cases. The issue however is that the user cannot select the ISO manually or choose a scene mode at 23 Megapixel (4:3 aspect ratio) or 20 Megapixel (16:9 aspect ratio) resolution even in Manual mode. In order to choose a scene mode or manually select the ISO, the user needs to choose a resolution of 8 Megapixel or less in either 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio. Once you do so, the ISO goes all the way upto 3200 and the performance is pretty good. We do understand that at such high Megapixels, the noise levels would be higher but the solution isn’t to take away ISO controls fully but rather to fix an upper ISO limit like the did on the Z3. The Z3 allowed users to choose upto ISO 800 in 20 Megapixel mode but upto ISO 3200 in 8 Megapixel modes. We hope that Sony allows this to be changed with a future firmware update. The dynamic range is quite good too especially when using the HDR mode which also works well at night. You can click on any of the photos below for the full resolution samples.. The photos on the left are taken in normal mode while the photos on the right are taken in HDR mode.. The front-facing camera has received a major bump in terms of resolution. Now the Z5 has a 5.1 Megapixel front facing camera. of the Z3+ compared to the 2.2 Megapixel units on the previous Z series phones such as Z3 and Z2. The performance from the front camera doesn’t really do much justice compared to the main camera. Images lack detail and often take too long to capture. This means that you’ll have to remain quite steady to capture a shot. However, it does produce bright and clear images which is a good thing to have especially when there is low light.. Video recording is great especially in 4K resolution however the field of view becomes narrower in 4K mode. The stabilizer feature works decently on 4K video in the standard mode but where it really excels is using the Intelligent Active mode. With Intelligent Active mode turned on, the videos are one of the smoothest we have seen on any smartphone available in the market. Intelligent active stabilization works only for 1080p at 30fps while the 1080p at 60 fps and 4K at 30 fps supports only standard stabilization. It is weird that Sony hasn’t included a dual-tone or even a dual-LED flash with their camera even though the camera is one of the USP’s of the device. The LED flash isn’t very powerful and in most cases doesn’t really help much. Luckily the device has a good dynamic range and good performance in low light which is good enough for most occasions.. Here is a 4K video sample. Here is a 1080p samples at 30fps with Intelligent Active Stabilization. Coming to the software, the Z5 has one of the most advanced camera UIs currently. It offers a wide range of controls especially for photos. When held in landscape mode, you have the flash toggle at the bottom left corner and the camera switch at the upper left corner. Between these two, you have the mode switch which consists of Superior Auto, Manual, Video and Apps. At the bottom, you have the settings shortcut at the left, the quick controls for white balance and exposure, the shutter key, the scene key as well as the gallery shortcut. You can enable grid lines to help you compose your shot better. There is a self-timer option along with settings for resolution, ISO and HDR. You can choose between the various metering and focus modes as well as a smile shutter. You can even select how much of a smile needs to be present to trigger the shutter. You have the usual touch to capture, volume key functions, sound options etc. You can also implement touch block feature if you want to take photos underwater for example. Any touches on the screen will be neglected and instead the focus will be on the hardware shutter button itself which can be used to focus and take the shot.. The hardware shutter key is something that we’ve always liked about Sony, it is a dying trend in the pursuit for thinner smartphones but we would take a hardware shutter button over a slimmer phone anyday. The two stage key offers good feedback and can be programmed to quick launch the camera app or even quick launch and take a photo or capture video without having to unlock or wake up your device separately.However, it will do this in auto mode and if you do need to access manual mode, you will have to bypass the security authentication. The main thing that needs to change about the Z5 camera is RAW support. As of now, Sony doesn’t have the feature but with such a good quality camera, it deserves one. We hope that Sony will do its best to release RAW capture as soon as possible.. The Z5 comes with a smaller battery than its predecessors. The 2900mAH battery is non-removable but it does support Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 which will charge your phone by 60% in 30 minutes. Unlike the Z series smartphones of the past, the Z5 actually doesn’t have stellar battery life. The smartphone scored a one-charge rating of 10 hours and 38 minutes in our battery tests which is quite average. If you are a heavy user like me, the phone won’t last you an entire day but at least when it does run out of juice, you have a quick charging feature which will allow you to get up and running in no time. Check out the complete set of Sony Xperia Z5’s battery life test results here .. The Sony Xperia Z5 is a really capable smartphone and a worthy successor not just to the Z3 but to the Z3+ as well. It may not break free from Sony’s design language and that is probably one of the reasons why it may go unnoticed. But it is every bit a flagship material as its competitors are. Despite the battery life taking a dip and the loudspeaker not performing as well as expected, the smartphone still has a lot going for it. The list of pros and cons itself will give you enough reasons to buy one. It definitely is a bit expensive at Rs 48,000 but it offers some features that aren’t available on other flagships at the moment.. Sandeep Sarma is a blogger and a freelance photographer.

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 32 GB + MicroSD. Release date: Oct 2, 2015. View all photos (57). Click to read the full review. Based on 12 User reviews. Thin body, measuring less than 7.5mm/0.3inches (0.29 inches). As it's featuring the signature time-tested OmniBalance design, it's rather hard to mistake Sony's new flagship for anything else than a top-end Xperia, sporting signature OmniBalance design with metal elements and matte back glass cover. At the front we have a 5.2-inch 1080p display; under the hood, we find a Snapdragon 810 chipset, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, microSD card slot, and 2,900mAh battery. There's also a 23MP rear camera with Exmor RS sensor and what's claimed as the world's fastest autofocus (0.03s); at the front, we find a 5MP selfie shooter with an Exmor R sensor. Android 5.1 with Sony's Xperia UI runs the show.. Sony Xperia X vs Sony Xperia Z5 Sony Xperia Z5 Review Sony Xperia Z5 manual Sony Xperia Z5 benchmarks. OS: Android (7.1, 7.0, 6.0, 5.1). Dimensions: 5.75 x 2.83 x 0.29 inches (146 x 72 x 7.3 mm). Weight: 5.43 oz (154 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Materials: Main body: Glass; Accents: Metal. Colors: Black, Gold, Pink, Green, White. IP certified - The IP code indicates the degree of protection against dust and water. The first number represents dust protection, while the second represents water protection. In IP67, for example, 6 means a completely dust-tight device, while 7 means the device can stay immersed in up to 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes. In IP68, a higher level of water protection is expected, but exact numbers aren't specified: both depth and continuance are specified by the manufacturer on per device basis.. Display Physical size: 5.2 inches. Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels. Features: Oleophobic coating, Scratch-resistant glass (Tempered Glass), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Digital image stabilization, Touch to focus, Smile detection, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Scenes, Effects. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Octa-core, 2000 MHz, ARM Cortex-A57 and ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 13.16 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 21.7 days (520 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 17.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 22.5 days (540 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Stand-by time (4G): 20.8 days (500 hours) the average is 23 days (549 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: DLNA, Wireless screen share, MHL, MirrorLink.

GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 02 Sep 2015. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..
