Single Review, online available, Medium, Date: 06/01/2017. This display is quite big for a smartphone but frequently used for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. ZTE is short for Zhong Xing Telecommunication Equipment Company Limited, which was founded in China in 1985. The product range includes, for example, USB sticks, routers, smartphones and tablets.. The ratings of the relatively many reviews have a wide range from below-average to very good (as of 2016).. Similar devices from a different Manufacturer. Prestigio Grace R5 LTE Mali-T720 MP2.

ZTE Nubia N1 Lite - a serious simplification. Quite often, after one successful smartphone manufacturer releases its improved or, conversely, simplified versions in the hope of additional profit. In the second case, it is vitally important for the manufacturer to maintain the recognition of the original phone, its characteristics. Unfortunately, this does not always happen..

Let him inherit from the "older brother" a fingerprint scanner , and the logo of the brand on the back panel, curved glass of the 5.5-inches display, but the effect of an expensive, technological device is lost. The IPS-OGS -panel became simpler. It is characterized only by HD -resolution, and the brightness and contrast parameters are noticeably smaller. However, working with such a screen in the sun is quite possible and even comfortable.. It should be noted that the quad-core Mediatek MT6737 processor at a resolution in 1280x720 pixels in terms of performance is almost inferior to MT6750. 2GB of RAM and the Mali T720MP2 video adapter will launch almost any modern game or application.

Nubia N1 lite Smartphone Launched at MWC 2017. Shekhar Thakran , 28 February 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The phone will be made available at the end of March. Company claims fingerprint scanner can unlock device in 0.3 seconds. Asian launch will include India as well. ZTE brand Nubia has launched a stripped-down version of its Nubia N1 smartphone - Nubia N1 lite at MWC 2017 in Barcelona. The original Nubia N1 was launched last year by the company and just last month the company introduced a new variant of the smartphone, available in Black and Gold colour combination and with 64GB of inbuilt storage, twice as much as available before in the country.. The smartphone will be made available at the end of March and will be available in European countries including Spain, Germany, Czech Republic, and Italy. In Asia, the Nubia N1 lite will be made available in India, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia.. The Nubia N1 lite runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow out-of-the-box and despite what the name might suggest, still sports a 5.5-inch display like the original Nubia N1 but the screen resolution has been downgraded from full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) to 720p, GSMArena notes. The device will be powered by a quad-core processor, unlike the octa-core processor on the Nubia N1, coupled with 2GB of RAM. The Nubia N1 lite comes with 16GB of inbuilt storage and houses a 3000mAh battery, Android Authority reports .. In terms of optics, the Nubia N1 lite sports an 8-megapixel rear camera with an f/2.0 aperture tagged with dual-LED flash and a 5-megapixel camera at front.. Additionally, there is a fingerprint scanner located at the back of the device, which as per company's claims, is capable of unlocking the Nubia N1 lite in 0.3 seconds.. "With its finely textured coating and inward-sloping sides, the phone sits comfortably in the user's palm. The rear-mounted 'unipanel', comprised of a fingerprint sensor and rear-facing camera, features a decorative metallic design, adding an additional layer of sophistication to the phone's stylish appearance," the company said in its Nubia N1 lite launch release..
