CNET también está disponible en español.. The best phone you can’t get (unless you’re in China). The Good Premium materials and top-of-the-line hardware means it's a flagship phone that competes with the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 7.. The Bad The dual-camera setup isn't very good and the phone's glass back is great to look at but can be slippery to hold. It's only available in one country for now.. The Bottom Line Xiaomi’s Mi 6 could do some real damage if the company sold it more places. Visit manufacturer site for details.. All the bling in the world Double the cameras. The Xiaomi Mi 6 is one of the best Android phones around.. I love the Mi 6 for what it is -- an amazing device with the same speedy processor as the. Samsung Galaxy S8 ( $597.42 at Amazon.com ). and a beautiful design that stands out on its own. It also comes with dual-cameras, and takes portrait pictures like the. Apple iPhone 7 Plus ( $891.02 at Amazon.com ). and now, the OnePlus 5. You get Android goodness with some Apple-like features. And it costs a lot less than your typical flagship phone. Well, how about the fact that it's still only available in China two months on from its launch. Xiaomi said it would reach other countries "soon", but it couldn't tell me when exactly it's going to start rolling out.. While eager beavers could order a Mi 6 from China, take heed that the LTE may not work in countries such as the US -- you'll have to compare to your carrier's network bands to be sure. And there are no Google Play services in China so until the company releases a global ROM, you'd have to sideload it if you want native apps such as Google Maps.. Xiaomi's Mi 6 is pure bling. The lack of global availability means Xiaomi may be missing the boat in most markets that would have loved to grab a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 powered phone on the cheap. The cheapest version of the phone retails for about $365, £280 or AU$485 converted, and that model gets you 4GB RAM and 64GB of onboard storage. Step it up to the 6GB RAM version with 128GB onboard storage and you'll pay 2,899 Chinese yuan -- about $420, £330 or AU$560.. A premium ceramic version with 18K gold finish and 128GB of storage space sells for just a little more at 2,999 Chinese yuan. That's about $435, £340 or AU$580.. If you're lucky enough to get and use the Mi 6, you'll find an affordable flagship that matches the Galaxy S8 where it counts. Though it's missing some features, including wireless charging. It makes you wonder just how much of a premium you're paying for other high-end flagships such as the Galaxy S8 or the Sony Xperia XZ Premium. If you live outside China, keep reading to see what the Mi 6 will bring you -- but hold out for the international version before committing.. The power and volume buttons are located on the same side -- and the only problem with that is that I can't use it with my car mount -- the clamps press down on the power button, turning it off.. The Mi 6's glass and stainless steel frame stand out. The phone comes in the standard shades of black or white, plus a much snazzier blue-and-gold version that's visually stunning.. I particularly loved that color, and it's a great conversation starter as well. I can't tell you how many people looked at it and said, "Wow." That said, the glass rear can be a tad slippery to hold at times.. The Mi 6 has a 5.15-inch screen with a 1080-pixel display that looks good to the naked eye. Pixel density isn't as sharp on paper as the Galaxy S8, but my eyes didn't strain trying to read news stories or social media updates. Colors pop, and while it has a maximum brightness of 600 nits, it goes all the way down to one at night, helping you not strain your eye. The phone won't take a long dunking like the Galaxy S8 or LG G6, but it is splash-proof, so you shouldn't worry too much about small spills.. Like other Xiaomi phones, the Mi 6 runs MIUI, a customized version of Android 7.1.1.. One of the Mi 6's key features is its dual 12-megapixel camera setup, which is a hot trend these days. While it's not the first time Xiaomi has used it on phones , it's the first time a Xiaomi phone has added portrait mode similar to the one found in the iPhone 7 Plus (Xiaomi even calls it the same thing).. Portrait Mode works the same way as it does on the iPhone 7 Plus: you stand in front of the object and let the phone apply the effect. It's much simpler than the effect on previous Xioami models such as the. Redmi Pro , which let you tweak the depth of field after shooting the picture. As for the quality, well, that's trickier. The Mi 6's Portrait Mode feels very finicky; half the time it detects the object properly, the other time you're either too close to apply the effect or the picture winds up being too out of focus..

Unlike OnePlus and Huawei, Xiaomi has yet to become a household name outside of its native China. But although Xiaomi’s devices may not be so easily available in Europe and America, some of them are certainly worth hunting down.. The Xiaomi Mi 6 is one such device; a compact Android phone offering plenty of power and a lovely screen that undercuts even the OnePlus 5 for value.. The Xiaomi Mi 6 is an iteration of the design first seen with the company’s Mi 5 phone last year, and considering that handset was a pleasure to hold and use, this is far from an issue. In fact, the Mi 6 is one of the only Android flagships – aside from the Huawei P10 – to stick with a fairly small 5-inch display and keep the phone manageable in size.. The combination of the small display, heavily curved sides on the rear and the slightly curved screen mean that if you’re looking for a phone that’s comfortable to use one-handed then this is it.. It looks great too, and considering the price is well built in the main. While there’s no plastic to be seen, except for some mushy volume keys, some corner-cutting has evidently taken place. The Mi 6 picks up scratches like no other phone I’ve used in a long time; I even discovered a deep scratch on its rear when I took it out of the box. In addition, the back glass panel has already started to come unstuck in the bottom corner, and with little force I can pry it away leaving a visible gap.. The biggest omission on the Xiaomi is the lack of a headphone jack. The company says this is the result of a space issue, and in order to fit in a bigger battery and splash-proof rating, something had to go. I find that an odd response – there are several phones on the market that have full IP ratings and yet manage to retain the headphone jack. In my opinion, a headphone jack is still a requisite on a phone and it will continue to be until quality Bluetooth headphones come down in price. You do get a flimsy 3.5mm dongle in the box that you’ll probably lose instantly, but no USB-C headphones.. Tucked under the glass on the front is a ceramic fingerprint sensor that’s exceptionally fast and reliable.. Xiaomi is one the few brands that hasn’t yet made the switch from 1080p to quad-HD on any of its phones, but in most ways that’s a good thing. The 5.15-inch LCD panel here is one of the best I’ve seen, and is noticeably more attractive than the Huawei P10 due to much richer colours and a more even brightness.. Most phones manage good peak brightness, and the Xiaomi Mi 6 certainly does that reaching 600 nits, but it also does well in the dark – when you want what’s onscreen to be visible but not blinding.. 1080p seems the right choice for a display of this size and pixels are impossible to spot. You also benefit from that lower-res screen, which requires less power with the knock-on effect of better battery life – another area in which the Mi 6 really impresses..

LCD panels don’t quite achieve the deep colour saturation, nor the deepest blacks, seen on AMOLED panels from the likes of Samsung, but really this display is so impressive that this isn’t much of an issue. What IPS LCDs do have over their AMOLED counterparts is much better viewing angles, however.. Interestingly, the screen doesn’t feature a polarising filter on it, so if you’re wearing certain types of sunglasses then you simply won’t be able to see the screen outside.. The Xiaomi Mi 6 was one of the first phones announced to be running Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 SoC, and the rest of the device’s internals are all high-end. There’s 6GB of RAM and either 64GB or 128GB of storage available – but, annoyingly, no microSD support.. Considering the high-end specs it’s no surprise that the Xiaomi Mi 6 runs fantastically well. During my few weeks with the device I’ve suffered no lag or slowdown, and the Adreno 540 GPU handles each and every Android game with ease.. The biggest issue I can see arising is that since this phone isn’t built to be used outside of Asia, it’s missing a few of the required LTE bands worldwide. In the US, for example, you won’t get 4G support on the major networks; but here in the UK I have 4G working on both Three and EE. Call and Wi-Fi quality is good, and the mics do a good job at noise-cancelling.. Like the iPhone 7 and HTC 10 , the Xiaomi Mi 6 manages to pump out decent audio by combining one speaker on the bottom of the device, next to the USB-C port, and another next to the ear piece above the display. It sounds good, much better than the Samsung Galaxy S8 , but not as good as the HTC U11. However, it doesn’t really get very loud. It also lacks a punch of bass, meaning it’s fine for YouTube videos but not so much for audio.. Synthetic benchmarks are becoming increasingly redundant and I don’t find them a trustworthy source of determining the speed of a phone. Recently, many phones I’ve reviewed simply don’t appear to run benchmarking suites properly, and that’s what I’ve found with the Mi 6.. Battery life, camera, software and verdict.

We hate spam just like you do and will never send you too much email, nor will we ever share your information with anyone.. by Joshua Vergara May 30, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Smooth, solid performance thanks to the Snapdragon 835. MIUI may not be for everyone. Camera capabilities arenât fully fleshed out. It isnât perfect, but the Xiaomi Mi 6 manages to bring together a ton of features we loved last year into one cohesive, affordable package that warrants your attention.. last year with its 2016 flagship, the Mi 5. was the Mi 5 affordable, beautiful, and packed with top-tier features, it was also one of the first devices to sport Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 processor. Unfortunately the device never officially made its way to the United States, and even if you did manage to import one it lacked the proper 4G LTE bands.. Now Xiaomi is back with its 2017 flagship smartphone, the Mi 6. With the Xiaomi Mi 6, you get a phone with high-end specs, a unique design, a zoom lens, andÂ. The problem is, like the Mi 5, this phone isn’t coming to the West. That means folks residing in the U.S. will need to import one from a third-party website. But if you happen to live elsewhere, is this phone worth your hard-earned cash?. Find out, in our Xiaomi Mi 6 review!. Because I, Joshua Vergara, used the Xiaomi Mi 6Â. in the States on the T-Mobile network, I was not able to get the best example of the Mi 6âs performance. As a Chinese phone, this device lacked the radios for LTE connectivity and even then had problems sticking to an HSPA+ connection. This is common for a phone made for other markets, but it does mean that this review is a bit less deep on the hard specifications. Please keep this in mind when reading ourÂ. The Mi 6 manages to stand out with its design. While it doesn’t stray too farÂ. from past Xiaomi phones, we still applaud the company for trying to be unique. The Mi 6 variant in this review is also theÂ. ceramic edition , which makes it quite a bit heavier than the standard glass model. comes with the highest configuration of specifications (more on that later).. The ceramic shines beautifully and is complemented by small gold accents. The ceramic shines beautifully and is complemented by small gold accents – 18K gold accents, to be exact. Yes, Xiaomi seems to spare no expense when it comes to the materials of this phone, but it almost makes you wonder how the retail price could be so low. Nevertheless, it feels incredibly premium and hefty, but can slip around in the handÂ. is a case included that helps a bit with the handling.. Below the display, you’ll find a set ofÂ. back and recent apps keys, which flank the physical home button. The home button also doubles as a fingerprint sensor,Â. has proven to be fast and accurate in our experience. an added bonus, the capacitive keys can also be customized in the settings menu.. There’s one more major design decision worth pointing out here, and that’s the lack of a 3.5 mm headphone jack. Though it is a controversial move, Xiaomi says removing it allowed them to include a bigger 3,350 mAh battery.. Despite being a flagship device, the Mi 6 does fall behind the pack a bit with its 1080p display. This LCD isnât bad in any regard, though Quad HD is very much a standard this year in high-end devices. However, Xiaomi has done a great job at making the LCD panel extremely bright in daylight, and also impressively dark when the slider is cranked to zero. This level of darkness is something we’d normally expect from AMOLED displays, but somehow Xiaomi was able to make it work with the Mi 6’s LCD panel.. Despite being a flagship device, the Mi 6 does fall behind the pack a bit with its 1080p display. Overall I didnât have any issues with the display, though sometimes I did have trouble finding the brightness slider in dark environments. really dark when the slider is turned all the way down.. find the latest and greatest specs insideÂ. Aside from the Galaxy S8 and HTC U11 , the Mi 6 is one of the first devices to sport the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. It also comes with either 4 or 6 GB of RAM and up to 128 GB of on-board storage. As I alluded to earlier, the ceramic edition is considered the most premium of the bunch, as it comes with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage.. Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus review: Almost to Infinity. With the Samsung Galaxy S9 just around the corner, we thought this would be a fun time to take a look back at our review for the current S8 family. HTC has had a rough go of it in the extremely competitive flagship space, and the company needs a hit on their hands to make a comeback. Now, with its latest high-end offering, â¦. I’ve been using the Mi 6 to take tons of photos and videos, and I’ve also been using it as my main gaming device over the past few weeks. In both of these situations, I found no reason to doubt the performance and overall reliability of the phone. As I mentioned in the disclaimer, IÂ. unfortunately wasn’t able to use the device to its fullest on T-Mobile’s network here in the U.S., so I had to rely on Wi-Fi and tethering to get things done in many cases. However, call quality was adequate and was helped along by the dual speaker setup. In a configuration similar to last year’sÂ. HTC 10 , a bottom mounted speaker is accompanied by a unit in the call speaker. Thus, the phone’s audio has some good stereo sound, but unfortunately doesnât get all that loud. Things get better when connecting headphones, as a built-in EQ provides a nice amount of sound customization. However, youâll have to keep the headphone jack adapter handy.. The biggest issue I ran into when reviewing the Mi 6 is assessing battery life, as the phone was only connected to T-Mobile via HSPA. I was able to make it to the end of the day on a single charge, but that could definitely change when connected to proper high speed internet.. Android Authority’s own battery testing app, the Mi 6 was able to achieve about seven hours of continuous screen-on usage using a mixture of gaming, browsing, and video playback. In my personal usage, I was able to get close to six hours of screen-on time primarily on my home Wi-Fi network. And when I was running low on a charge, Quick Charge 3.0 helped keep the Mi 6’s battery topped off throughout the day.. Xiaomi is shipping the Mi 6 with its own custom version of Android, MIUI 8 , atop Android 7.1.1 Nougat .Â. And if you’re at all familiar with Xiaomi devices, you probably already knowÂ. that MIUI doesn’t come with an app drawer, which means you’ll need to rely on folders to help organize your home screens. This is par for the course for many other Chinese ROMs, but users in the West might have a hard time getting used to it.. Even though we’re using the latest version of MIUI on the Mi 6, the core experience hasn’t changed much at all over the years.. Some extra features include a Dual App mode that allows multiple iterations of the same application, a Deep Clean application that helps to clear the phone of junk files, and included Mi Cloud storage if you have a Mi account. If thereâs one thing we always enjoy hearing about with MIUI, itâs how often it gets updated due to feedback in the Mi forums. All in all, if youâre familiar with MIUI (and, really, any Chinese ROM) there isnât much else that differentiates this new version.. If you have been following the trend of this review, you may notice that the Xiaomi Mi 6 seems to take a lot of the best features from previous devices and puts them into one complete package. Thatâs definitely true for the camera, which is a dual lens system that provides a 2x optical zoom aside the original wider angle. Zoom can be quite important to shutterbugs and Xiaomi has done well to provide one for picture taking in particular. Zoom capabilities are unfortunately not available for video recording, which is a rather significant downside.. Throughout the testing period, I have enjoyed using the Xiaomi Mi 6 for video recording. Optical image stabilization helps keep all footage from looking too jittery, and there was a good amount of detail in each shot. Even though exposure might jump around from time to time, there was little to complain about other than the omission of zoom when in Movie Mode. I was told that this misstep is not a problem with the hardware and could be opened up in the future via a MIUI software update.. I've really enjoyed using the Xiaomi Mi 6 for video recording. The camera software in the Mi 6 provides a few extra modes that shutterbugs will be particularly fond of, including a Pro mode. And even as an automatic shooter, the Mi 6’s camera is quick enough to take a good shot, even when shooting in HDR mode. HDR is a toggle rather than an automatic mode, and keeping it on will often boost up the shadows and bump up the saturation to a noticeable degree.. Pictures in broad daylight generally came out looking good, though the dynamic range left a bit to be desired. Highlights tend to be too bright when I tried to bring up the exposure compensation for better shadows. And this same overly bright effect was observed in HDR adjustments, too. While zooming into elements without a loss in quality is a nice option to have, but it wasnât required in a ton of situations.. That is, until you use the marquee feature of the Xiaomi Mi 6 camera – Portrait Mode. Heavily inspired by the iPhone Portrait Mode, Xiaomi utilizes the optical zoom to tighten up the frame while working to isolate the subject from the background. When subjects are, at most, a couple of meters away, the phone goes right into a Depth Effect mode, adding bokeh to the background elements.. Xiaomi Mi 6 camera samples (Portrait Mode). The Mi 6 does a decent job of this as it softens out the edges, but it does sometimes cut the line a bit incorrectly. This is only really noticeable when zooming in; taken on their own, the portrait photos turned out to be the most enjoyable part of the camera experience. Especially in good lighting, photos of friends and colleagues yielded new-profile-picture-level shots. Lower light situations make these and pretty much any other photo suffer especially in the finer details of the pictures, making this a less than ideal indoor or nighttime camera.. Processor 2.45 GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. Camera Rear: Dual 12 MP rear cameras, f/1.8 and f/2.6 apertures, PDAF, dual LED flash, OIS. Software MIUI 8 (based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat). Dimensions and weight 145.2 x 70.5 x 7.5 mm. Much like the Portrait Mode, it is when the phone focuses on a specific feature or capability that it manages to provide some high points. However, trying to do too much just bogs down the overall package. The Xiaomi Mi 6 is by far the most capable phone Xiaomi hasÂ. made to date (the “most unique” title goes to the Mi MIX , of course). But in its quest to provide every feature weâve loved in the last couple years, it falls just short of perfection.. The dual speaker is a bit reserved, the battery is big but sacrifices the headphone jack, and the dual camera isnât as capable as we would like. Itâs a give and take with the Xiaomi Mi 6, and it comes right down to its price — a price that is equivalent to $360. Thatâs an incredible price that would make anyone in the West excited, only itâs not available anywhere but the opposite side of the world.. So we hope that Xiaomi expands further with their next phone as long as they continue this trend of selling their phones at as close to cost as possible. Xiaomi has made strides with theÂ. Mi Note 2 that was globally capable and then the limited release Mi MIXÂ. If this ceramic Mi 6 came with the global radios, Xiaomi could have a hit.. The Mi 6 could be one of the best bang for buck phones in existence. Even with the cons, the pros are stacked with the price point leading the way. It might not be perfect as a flagship, but if you can get your hands on it, this amalgam of features could be one of the best bang for buck phones in existence.. Xiaomi , xiaomi mi 6.

Xiaomi Mi 6 review: A new beginning. If you're willing to look past the lack of a 3.5mm jack, the Mi 6 is a fantastic phone.. The Mi 6 gets a lot of things right — powerful hardware in the form of a Snapdragon 835, dual rear cameras with 2x optical zoom, and a gorgeous metal-and-glass design, all at a price that's nearly half that of the Galaxy S8. The phone isn't without its drawbacks: availability is limited to China, and there's no 3.5mm jack. That said, the Mi 6 is Xiaomi's best showing yet.. Xiaomi Mi 6 Full review. Xiaomi saw a resurgence in 2016 on the back of strong sales in India and China from its entry-level Redmi series. Eager to continue the momentum, the manufacturer course-corrected its strategy at the end of last year, now focusing on offline sales to boost growth.. OPPO and Vivo relied on a similar strategy to amass millions of customers over the last two years, with the two manufacturers accounting for over 13% of the global handset market. Xiaomi doesn't have the production line facilities or the resources to make its phones available at thousands of retail stores, so the brand is being smart about its offline strategy. Over the next two years, Xiaomi is looking to establish over 100 Mi Home stores in China, exclusive storefronts showcasing the best the brand has to offer.. One of the reasons Xiaomi can sell its devices for so low is because of its manufacturing process. Instead of making millions of devices at a time, it makes phones in smaller production runs, giving the brand the ability to eke out more profits over the course of a phone's lifecycle as component costs come down.. While this strategy has paid dividends in the budget segment with the Redmi series, Xiaomi hasn't fared so well in the mid-range tier with the Mi and Mi Note devices. The manufacturer is looking to change that with the Mi 6, a phone that according to the brand is a culmination of over seven years' worth of effort. Has it paid off? It's time to find out.. MIUI 8.2 based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat. 5.15-inch 1080p (1920x1080) IPS LCD panel 3D curved glass 428ppi pixel density. Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Four Kryo 280 cores at 2.45GHz Four Kryo280 cores at 1.90GHz 10nm. 12MP camera with 4-axis OIS and f/1.8 lens Second 12MP camera with f/2.6 lens and 2x zoom dual-tone LED flash, PDAF 4K video recording. LTE with VoLTE Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Bluetooth 5.0, NFC, GPS, GLONASS USB-C, IR blaster. Front fingerprint sensor Qualcomm Sense ID. I (Harish Jonnalagadda) am writing this review after using the Xiaomi Mi 6 for two weeks in Hyderabad, India. The phone is a Chinese retail unit provided for review by Xiaomi and comes with the requisite LTE bands for India.. I relied on Jio's 4G network for cellular connectivity throughout the duration of the review. The phone came with the Chinese ROM out of the box, and I flashed the global beta MIUI 8 ROM — based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat — as soon as it became available. Xiaomi rolled out several updates over the course of the review period, with the latest build (MIUI 8 7.6.8) bringing several stability fixes.. From the back, the Mi 6 looks stunning. Xiaomi switched to a glass back last year with the Mi 5 — and then moved to a metal finish with the Mi 5s — but the design aesthetic of the Mi 6 is the most polished yet from the manufacturer. The 3D glass curves on all sides, merging with the stainless steel frame to create a seamless transition. The effect is more pronounced on the ceramic edition, but the black color variant I'm using also looks great.. The 5.15-inch screen, placement of the power and volume buttons, and the rounded edges make it easy to hold and use the Mi 6 one-handed. An interesting addition with the Mi 6 is a speaker that's embedded in the earpiece. As is common on most Xiaomi phones, there's an IR blaster located at the top of the device.. The Mi 6 finally has a decent amount of heft to it, and it feels great to hold. The one downside of the glass finish is that the phone is prone to sliding off surfaces. Three days after I started using it, the phone slid right off my nightstand and fell to the floor f4 feet below. Thankfully, it came away without any damage to the glass back — Gorilla Glass 5 hard at work there.. While the glass itself is fairly resilient to tumbles, it doesn't weather scratches the same way. Over the course of the last month, the phone managed to pick up a litany of microscratches, both on the back and front. The standard color variant hides the scratches fairly well, but you'll need to buy a case if you want your Mi 6 to continue looking pristine.. The Mi 6 is Xiaomi's best design to date.. While more and more vendors are switching to QHD panels on their flagships as a way of differentiation, Xiaomi is more than content using Full HD screens. We've seen that last year on the Mi 5, Mi 5s, and the 5.7-inch Mi Note 2, and the situation is no different this time around with the Mi 6. For a device with a 5.15-inch screen, Full HD is more than adequate — a QHD panel would have created undue strain on the chipset and would ultimately be detrimental to battery life.. The LCD panels Xiaomi uses are some of the best currently available, boasting excellent brightness (it hits 600nits in Auto mode) and color accuracy. However, it just doesn't match the latest AMOLED panels from Samsung when it comes to color saturation.. The screen also manages to get sufficiently dim for night-time reading — there's a blue light filter included to prevent strain on your eyes, and you can configure the feature to work on selected apps. As is always the case with Xiaomi phones, you get plenty of options to customize the display to your liking — there are three modes to choose from for the color saturation and contrast levels.. You can also set up a double tap gesture to power up the screen. One issue with the display is the lack of polarization — if you're using the phone outdoors with sunglasses on, you won't be able to see the screen.. Xiaomi was the first to roll out Qualcomm's Sense ID last year in the Mi 5s, and the Mi 6 continues that trend. Unlike a traditional fingerprint sensor — which scans in 2D — Qualcomm's implementation utilizes ultrasound to take a 3D map of your fingerprints, leading to a higher degree of accuracy.. The system had its quirks on the Mi 5s, but there were no such issues on the Mi 6. The always-on sensor was always quick to authenticate, and the benefit with Sense ID is that it works even when your fingers are wet or moist.. Running Qualcomm's latest chipset under the hood, the Mi 6 has no issues when it comes to everyday performance. The phone blazes through everyday tasks with ease, and there's more than enough power available for even the most demanding games. The phone comes with 6GB of RAM as standard, and while you don't necessarily need that much memory, it helps in making the phone future-proof.. You'll be able to pick up the Mi 6 with either 64GB or 128GB of internal storage, and the options available should make up for the fact that there isn't a microSD slot on the phone. That means you do get slots for two SIM card slots. You also get Wi-Fi ac with 2x2 MIMO, with a maximum throughput of 867Mbit.. The Mi 6 has Qualcomm's Category 16 LTE modem, paving the way for Gigabit LTE speeds on mobile. The Mi Note 2 was the first Xiaomi phone to offer global LTE bands — over 37 bands for worldwide LTE coverage. While it would have been great to see the Mi 6 offer similar connectivity, that isn't the case. The phone has just nine LTE bands — 1/3/5/7/8/38/39/40/41 — so if you're interested in using the Mi 6 outside of China, make sure the phone supports your carrier before making a purchase.. It looks like global LTE bands will be limited to the Mi Note series, as Xiaomi revealed that it would launch another device later this year with global LTE coverage.. And now for the elephant in the room — the Mi 6 doesn't have a 3.5mm jack. Xiaomi says that it got rid of the jack to make room for a larger battery and to make the device splash-resistant. Samsung and LG have managed to offer IP68 water resistance with their phones with the 3.5mm jack intact, whereas the Mi 6 doesn't even have an IP rating in spite of the removal of the audio jack.. To make matters worse, the brand doesn't make any USB-C headphones yet. At least when LeEco ditched the headphone jack last year in the Le Max 2, it offered a pair of decent quality USB-C earbuds. With the Mi 6, all you get is a USB-to-3.5mm adapter that you'll lose in about 3 seconds if you're not careful.. The issue isn't as dire if you've already moved to wireless audio, but if you have a lot of wired audio products lying around, get ready to use a dongle to enjoy your tunes. It's not an elegant workaround, and the removal of the 3.5mm jack is the one major drawback in an otherwise great phone.. I had a lot of issues with the battery life on the Mi 5 last year, but thankfully that isn't an issue on the Mi 6. The phone manages to last a day on a full charge, with usage spread across a few hours of web browsing, streaming music and videos, and navigation on cellular data.. I routinely saw over four hours of screen-on time from the Mi 6, a considerable improvement over both the Mi 5 and Mi 5s. Of course, the uptick in battery life is directly attributable to a larger 3,350mAh battery, 150mAh more than that of the Mi 5s. When you do need to top up, you'll be able to leverage Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 to get a 50% charge in just over 45 minutes.. Xiaomi doesn't have the best track record when it comes to platform updates, but in the case of the Mi 6, the manufacturer is offering Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box — a noticeable improvement from the Mi 5.. MIUI 8 has a ton of enhancements from last year, and while the version number hasn't changed, it feels much more fluid and stable. That's mainly due to the slew of updates Xiaomi continues to roll out on a bi-weekly basis. For all of its advantages, MIUI doesn't have an app drawer, and Xiaomi isn't likely to add one any time soon .. MIUI has picked up a lot of polish over the course of the last 12 months.. That said, there are a ton of features that augment the core Android experience, like the spam protection for calls and messages that's built into the dialer and messaging apps. Usage models in Asia vary wildly from those in Western countries, and as a result you'll see a lot of stuff in MIUI that won't make a lot of sense if you're using the phone in the U.S.. One such instance is the camera app, which tries to guess your gender and age in selfie mode. The feature has been present for several years, and while it doesn't work all that well outside of China — it offered wildly varying estimates for me — it is baked into the camera app.. As for features that do work well, there's a one-handed mode that you can easily access with a left-to-right swipe across the navigation keys, the ability to switch out the position of the back and overview buttons, scrolling screenshots, and more. A key utility is Dual Apps, which lets you run two instances of the same app. With the phone offering dual-SIM support, you'll be able to use two WhatsApp or Facebook accounts from the same device.. Second Space offers similar functionality, but the feature allows you to set up a secondary profile with its own cache of data, allowing you to separate your work and private data. Overall, the user interface has picked up a ton of stability fixes, and all the issues I had with the Redmi Note 4 and last year's Mi 5 have been fixed. Gmail notifications actually show up, and while MIUI continues to aggressively manage the memory, you can easily whitelist apps to run in the background. In short, this is the best iteration of MIUI in years.. The Mi 6's biggest improvement over its predecessor is in the imaging department. The primary shooter holds its own next to the best cameras available today, and the secondary telephoto lens delivers 2x optical zoom.. The primary shooter is a 12-megapixel Sony IMX386 sensor with f/1.8 lens,1.25-micron pixels, and 4-axis OIS — the same that was used in last year's Mi 5. The secondary 12MP camera uses Samsung's S5K3M3 ISOCELL sensor, and offers an f/2.6 lens along with 1.0-micron pixels — there's no OIS here.. The camera interface has toggles for HDR, 2x zoom, Portrait Mode, flash, and switching between still and video shooting modes. You get 12 live filters with live previews, and a bevy of shooting modes — Panorama, Beautify, Tilt Shift, Group mode, and Selfie. There's also a manual mode that allows you to adjust the white balance, focus, exposure, and ISO.. Like the Mi 5, the Mi 6 takes detailed images in bright conditions. Where the camera on Xiaomi's latest flagship differs is when shooting in low-light conditions — it's no longer a hit-or-miss affair. The Portrait Mode is particularly interesting, as it allows you to leverage the dual camera system to blur the background, putting the subject in focus.. Xiaomi Mi 6 Bottom line. Should you buy it Yes!. Simply put, the Mi 6 offers incredible value for its price. The phone has a stunning metal-and-glass design, along with build quality rivaling the best that Samsung and LG have to offer. It has powerful internals that outmatch flagships twice its price, and 6GB of RAM along with 128GB storage should be more than enough for most customers. The dual cameras add a new dimension, and the uptick in battery life is a welcome addition.. However, the same issues that plagued the Mi 5 also affect its successor — the Mi 6 won't be available in Western markets, and the limited LTE bands make it a non-starter in the U.S. That said, the phone should be heading to India later this year — Xiaomi's largest market outside of China. The lack of a 3.5mm jack is going to be a dealbreaker for potential customers, but as an overall package, the Mi 6 is one of the best Xiaomi phones to date.. The Mi 6 is a well-designed phone with top-notch internals and a capable dual camera system. Combine that with the best iteration of MIUI we've seen in years and all-day battery life, and the Mi 6 continues Xiaomi's tradition of offering great value-for-money phones.. The phone retails for the equivalent of $360 for the 64GB model and $420 in China for the 128GB model, but with sales limited to Xiaomi's home market, you'll have to rely on a third-party retailer to get your hands on one outside the country. Thankfully, GearBest is running a sale, where you can pick up the 64GB variant for $406 by using the code EGMI64 .. Harish Jonnalagadda is the Regional Editor at Android Central.

I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. Beijing-based Xiaomi rose to prominence years ago with a clear business model: produce good looking phones with very good specs that sell at a low price. That approach worked so well for a while, Xiaomi was at one point valued at US$45 billion in 2014. And though the company's growth has stagnated a bit in the last year or two, the company's not going to change their product strategy. -- I know because Xiaomi's senior vice president Wang Xiang told me so .. And so, Xiaomi's latest product, the Mi 6, is again an insanely good value when compared to other products out on the market. We're talking about a Snapdragon 835 processor, with 6GB of RAM, a hefty, waterproof unibody build, and a dual-camera set-up identical to the one found on the iPhone 7 Plus, all for a price of. $2499 or $2899 yuan depending on storage options (about US$360 or $420).. I really liked the Mi 5 last year , and the Mi 6 is a significant step up on every front. Whereas the mostly-glass Mi 5 felt almost too light in the hand--to the point that it felt almost hollow--the Mi 6. has that premium hefty (in a good way) feel you get from handling an iPhone. The metal frame that keeps the glass front and back in place feel sturdier and harder than on the Mi 5. Xiaomi's also done away with the clicky home button of last year in favor of a touch home button/fingerprint reader that's a. recessed slot on the bottom bezel -- sort of like the Huawei Mate 9 Pro's set-up.. The clicky home button of the Mi 5 has been done away in favor of this touch-sensitive slot that doubles as a fingerprint reader.. The Mi 5 (left) and the Mi 6 side by side.. Registering your finger is super fast, and after that the fingerprint reader unlocks almost instantly--I'd say Xiaomi has the second fastest and most accurate fingerprint reader behind Huawei. Both are just significantly faster than the terrible one found on the Galaxy S8.. All the buttons (power, volume rocker) on the Mi 6 feel very sturdy without wiggle, and there's even stereo speakers in this year's device, with sound coming from a bottom-firing speaker and the earpiece. Unfortunately, Xiaomi went the Apple route and removed the headphone jack, which in my opinion is a terrible decision. At least the phone is, according to Xiaomi founder Lei Jun, "splash-proof," meaning it's not quite as water-resistant as the IP68-certified LG G6 or Galaxy S8, but it's enough to save the phone from damage when used in the rain or at a water park. I tested this slightly by splashing water on the device's front and bottom and it worked as advertised. I wasn't brave enough to soak the entire phone in a bowl of water like I would an LG G6 though.. As you can already see from photos, the Mi 6 looks gorgeous, except for the relatively large bezels on top and below the screen. This is disappointing to me, considering Xiaomi led the way with the bezel-less movement last year. I know I'm nitpicking, but the Mi 6 measures. 5.72 x 2.78 x 0.30 in with a 5.1-inch screen.. The Galaxy S8, meanwhile, packs a much larger display into a similar sized body. Small bezel matters for in-hand use without sacrificing screen real estate.. At least the display is good, when compared to other 1080p displays. Xiaomi made an effort to lower minimum brightness with the Mi 6--to ease eye strain when using at night--and the phone gets all the way down to an impressive single nit of brightness.. 
CNET también está disponible en español.. Xiaomi's new Mi 6 is impressive but not game changing. The Chinese company's new beast looks slick and powerful, though less innovative than the Mi Mix.. by April 19, 2017 12:50 AM PDT. Xiaomi dazzles with new Mi 6 flagship. Xiaomi's new Mi 6 comes loaded with dual-cameras. Xiaomi MI 6 key specs Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor 4GB/6GB RAM, 64GB/128GB onboard storage 5.15-inch full-HD display (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) 3,350mAH battery Rear 12-megapixel dual cameras. The 5.15-inch Mi 6 looks like another strong Android phone from Xiaomi, but the company may have missed an opportunity to show how innovative it can be.. Xiaomi went a different route with its bezel-less Mi Mix concept phone last year, but the Mi 6 retains the look and feel of previous Xiaomi flagships, including physical menu keys. Perhaps the Chinese market prefers it this way, but the company could have taken a bold step into a world without buttons like the Samsung Galaxy S8 has.. Xiaomi's new flagship sports top-end specs, including a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, and it's a looker. The blue and gold version is stunning, while the normal white and black are as ogle-worthy as you'd expect from Xiaomi. This isn't Xiaomi's first dual-camera phone (that was the Redmi Pro ), the new Mi 6 joins other flagships from competitors such as Huawei, LG and Apple in offering one.. Xiaomi dazzles with new Mi 6 flagship. Instead of the LG G6 ( $569.95 at Amazon.com ) 's wide-angle dual cameras or Huawei's color and monochrome setup in the P10 ( $649.00 at Amazon.com ) , the Mi 6's rear 12-megapixel twin shooters use a telephoto and wide-angle lens setup like the iPhone 7 Plus ( $891.02 at Amazon.com ). Like Apple's phone, the Mi 6 has a Portrait Mode and features 2x optical zoom.. Unlike the iPhone where you swipe to Portrait Mode, Xiaomi's Portrait Mode is activated by tapping an onscreen button on the far left of the phone. It's not really obvious, so you may, like me, miss it the first time around. I couldn't quite get it to work properly, perhaps I didn't get enough distance between my subject and the background. For now, I'd say Apple's implementation is a lot better, but we'll give this the full test when we get our review unit.. The Mi 6 sports 12-megapixel dual-cameras, and like Apple's iPhone 7, uses a wide angle and telephoto lens to give users 2x optical zoom. There's also a Portrait Mode on the phone for taking really good pictures of your friends.. The new Mi 6 has curved edges, and a more expensive version of the phone will sport a ceramic rear. It remains to be seen if the phone will be slippery, though Xiaomi says it's designed to be grippy. I found this to be so at least, the phone didn't seem like it'd accidentally slip out of my hands.. One thing I noticed though, is that the phone is a crime scene investigator's dream. The glossy rear makes fingerprint smudges very obvious, though the white model doesn't have it as bad. I'm also not a fan of Xiaomi doing an Apple and removing the 3.5mm headphone jack -- audio now runs through the Type-C USB port.. The phone goes on sale in China on April 28 for 2,499 Chinese yuan (which converts to around $365, £280 or AU$485) for a model with 4GB RAM and 64GB onboard storage. A Mi 6 with 6GB RAM and 128GB onboard storage retails for 2,899 Chinese yuan (about $420, £330 or AU$560).. A premium ceramic version with 6GB RAM and 128GB onboard storage will retail for just a little more at 2,999 Chinese yuan (that's $435, £340 or AU$580). If you want to get one in the US, UK or Australia, you'll have to go through online third-party retailers.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. The Xiaomi Mi 6 (left); Samsung Galaxy S8 (middle); and the Huawei Mate 9 Pro.. In the past week I've been testing the newest flagships from Xiaomi and Samsung, and while they're phones aimed at different markets -- the Mi 6 won't be released in North America and sells for roughly half of what the Galaxy S8 is going for -- there are quite a bit of similarities between the two. For example, both phones use Snapdragon 835, the latest and much-hyped chip from Qualcomm (some versions of the S8 also runs on Samsung's own Exynos 8895 chip); both phones come in all sleek black; and both are following up on super well-received predecessors.. It's too early for a full review of either phone -- though I have a lot of impressions already that I may get to later -- so let's dive into some photo samples to check out each phone's cameras.. First, numbers: The Mi 6 has dual rear. The standard lens has f/1.8 aperture, while the second lens is a f/2.6 telephoto lens. This two-camera setup is much closer to the iPhone 7's implementation than LG's (one standard, one wide-angle) or Huawei's (one standard, one monochrome). The Galaxy S8, meanwhile, has only one rear camera, a 12-megapixel f/1.7 shooter.. Below are some photos taken in Singapore. All photos have been scaled down unless otherwise stated.. Both phones take strong photos in daylight (but then again, every new phone does). Zooming in 100% on my 4k monitor, I see that Xiaomi's shooter has a tiny bit more detail.. In low light, however, Samsung wins slightly.. Both images above look similar when scaled down, but zoom in 100% and the S8's shot is a bit punchier with less noise.. The next shots were taken usingn 2x zoom. The Mi 6, with a dedicated telephoto lens, can achieve 2x optical zoom while the S8 has to go for digital zoom. The results, however, look quite similar.. Mi 6, cropped parts are 100% scale.. I had the same issue with the iPhone 7 Plus when I reviewed it. I found that its so-called 2x true zoom didn't result in images that were any better than digital 2x zoom with the LG V20 or Galaxy Note 7.. The dual-camera on the back of the Mi 6 sit completely flush with the body.. The S8 ain't no slouch though. There is a very slight bump, but it's barely noticeable. It looks a hell lot better than that ugly S6 bump.. The Galaxy S8 is, just like the S7, an amazing low-light shooter though. The Mi 6 can do more fun tricks, like the bokeh effect, aka "portrait mode" that mainstream media keep crediting to the iPhone 7 when Huawei's P9 did it first.. Bokeh effect shots with the Mi 6.. The S8 focuses a lot faster than the Mi 6. But the fact that the Mi 6 is only around US$360 while the Galaxy S8 sells for a (somewhat absurd) $850 adds a lot of twist to this basic comparison though. I'll be back with more impressions and reviews of both phones..

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED.

Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 2457 MHz, Kryo 280, 64-bit, 10 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 3 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. by Kaloyan C.. Android - Android + Xiaomi - Xiaomi +. 2 Interface, Performance and Camera. 3 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction In the smartphone world, most of the time the public’s gaze is pointed at your Samsungs and Apples and LGs; the brands that make the flashiest and most eye-catching devices out there. But they are far from the only players on the market, especially once you enter markets such as China where the no-compromises approach doesn’t work out nearly as well. So it’s no surprise that Xiaomi , one of the bigger smartphone makers in the People’s Republic, would make its flagship device , the Mi 6 , so seemingly pedestrian: it has already proven it can do new and weird with the Mi MIX, but now it’s time to actually sell devices, so some corners inevitably have to be cut to be able to deliver good specs at a competitive price. Design Been there, done that Xiaomi makes a big deal out of the trendy reflective glass that covers the entirety of the Mi 6’s back, but in reality its shininess is nothing to write home about. The only real decorations on the back are the dual camera module on the top left, and an Apple -esque “Designed by Xiaomi Assembled in China [sic]” marking on the lower center (spoiler: the Apple thing is a recurring theme throughout this review). The front of the Mi 6 is as anonymous as can be: it could easily be mistaken for a Huawei P10 , OnePlus 5 , or almost any OPPO or Meizu device out there right now. This isn’t a big deal per se, but it gives the phone a very unfortunate “been there, done that” aesthetic which doesn’t exactly mesh with its high-end specs. The metallic frame surrounding the Mi 6’s edges plays host to an IR blaster mounted at the top and stereo speakers which can be found on the bottom. Xiaomi also chose to follow the trend and remove the 3.5 mm headphone jack, though it does provide an adapter inside the box. Display Seeing as the Mi 6’s price range is in the lower end of the flagship spectrum, it’s only natural we’ll be seeing a few corners get cut. Such is the case with the display, a 5.2-inch, Full HD LCD panel, which is noticeably cold and inaccurate in terms of color representation. To Xiaomi’s credit, this can be fixed, but only inside a confusing settings menu which claims to affect the contrast instead. The glass panel in front of the panel doesn’t appear to be quite durable, as it managed to pick up some fairly noticeable scratches in the week or so we used the phone — bad news for people prone to handling their devices more roughly.. 5.72 x 2.78 x 0.29 inches. 145.17 x 70.49 x 7.45 mm. 6.07 x 2.92 x 0.29 inches. 154.2 x 74.1 x 7.25 mm. 5.72 x 2.73 x 0.27 inches. 145.3 x 69.3 x 6.98 mm. 5.86 x 2.83 x 0.31 inches. 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Xiaomi Mi 6 Compare.

(Posts: 888; Member since: 22 Nov 2014). posted on 11 Jul 2017, 11:59. What does it offer? Mediocre display, mediocre camera, unstable camera app, compromised call quality, soft glass, no minijack, no MicroSd slot, no waterproofness and many other quirks.. (Posts: 463; Member since: 14 Feb 2016). posted on 11 Jul 2017, 09:22. The cons do not justify a 7.5 rating. According to your review, great battery life, great camera, great performance, and inexpensive. But, because the UI resembles iOS, it drops 2.5 points?.

Mediocre camera with unstable camera app, low quality glass, mediocre display, bad call quality, no minijack or MicroSD slot, no IP rating.. (Posts: 787; Member since: 04 May 2015). posted on 11 Jul 2017, 16:45. You keep on repeating the same thing. Have you ever owned a Xiaomi device before? I can't comment on the camera but my 18 month old Redmi Note 3 Pro has never had a screen protector and doesn't have a single scratch on the screen. I very much doubt Xiaomi would use a lower quality screen on the Mi6. My display is very nice too as is call quality. Personally I prefer a 3.5mm jack but the adapter is included. As for the IP rating, I think Android Authority had a recent survey asking how many readers had actually dunked their phones and it was only about 35% iirc. Now for the biggest crock of $hit: 64gb and certainly 128gb is plenty of storage for 99% of people especially when you include unlimited Google Photos storage in the equation. But of course no MicroSD has never been a con for the iPhone with it's measly 5gb of free cloud storage!. (Posts: 1867; Member since: 16 Jan 2011). posted on 11 Jul 2017, 21:13. in response to #24 Hide. There is a full durability review on youtube. the scratch test passes with flying colours - equal to the S8 in hardness.. I think iPhoneSamsungArena just hates china origin phones. (Posts: 953; Member since: 18 Dec 2013). posted on 11 Jul 2017, 09:54. posted on 11 Jul 2017, 10:22. Does not being available in the US affect its rating?. (Posts: 289; Member since: 02 Jul 2014). posted on 11 Jul 2017, 16:12. Off corse it does...that means it will cost more to import it, and that you won't have warranty and service support for it... And this is US based site, even with all you Indian guys reading it.. (Posts: 787; Member since: 04 May 2015). posted on 11 Jul 2017, 16:48. $420 for the 64gb model and $480 for the 128gb model at Geekbuying with free shipping and a 1 year warranty.

Yes it sounds, but on top of that you need to pay VAT and if you have any problems with device, good luck with geekbuying. (Posts: 787; Member since: 04 May 2015). posted on 12 Jul 2017, 10:09. in response to #36 Hide. There's no vat in the US. All my phones have been Chinese (Lenovo, Nubia, Jiayu, Xiaomi, THL, iNew to name a few) for the past four years and the few issues I've had have been dealt with satisfactorily by various vendors, including free shipping of the necessary parts if I didn't want to ship the phone back. I very much doubt you've ever bought from abroad and are basing your comments on hearsay..

(Posts: 102; Member since: 11 Mar 2016). posted on 11 Jul 2017, 10:51. I suppose I already have enough internet for today , I have read almost all xiaomi phones on this website. They just hate MIUI don't know why. I myself uses MIUI for since 2014 (from MIUI 5). I have no regret or anything, I am loving it , especially MIUI 8.Only thing you can say , it is heavy and may have seem like IOS. but iOS 11 most of the new features are already running well even before the announcement of iOS 11.. (Posts: 888; Member since: 22 Nov 2014). posted on 11 Jul 2017, 12:03. MIUI is too heavy, sometimes overcomplicated, has many ad-infested store versions and you shouldn't be forced to install a new software in a flagship device.. (Posts: 1867; Member since: 16 Jan 2011). posted on 11 Jul 2017, 21:15. If you don't like MIUI launcher, then just side load the Pixel launcher.. (Posts: 6747; Member since: 30 Sep 2014). posted on 12 Jul 2017, 06:25. it only has one store and it's play store, and no ad in all pre-installed apps.. probably you get the wrong version.. (Posts: 255; Member since: 21 Oct 2015). posted on 11 Jul 2017, 11:13. Review started and ended with skepticism. (Posts: 461; Member since: 16 Apr 2014). posted on 11 Jul 2017, 12:04. Its not meant to be sold in the United States you dickheads!! How can that be a con? You evaluate a device on what it is claimed to be. It is no secret that Xiaomi's number one market is China, number two is India and then eastern and southeast Asian countries in that order. Judgements like this destroy the writer's credibility.. (Posts: 1256; Member since: 15 Apr 2016). posted on 11 Jul 2017, 13:20. Fair point but some of Xiaomi's phones do work just fine here so it's a valid point.. (Posts: 289; Member since: 02 Jul 2014). posted on 11 Jul 2017, 16:18. You are trying to say it is a good thing that it is not available in US (and EU),and if you are buying it you are getting device without warranty and service support!?. Well, I guess you know that this is US based site, and it reviews are made from that point of view...if you don't like it( the fact that this is a bad thing for a device) just go on Chinese or Indian sites and you won't find same cons.. (Posts: 461; Member since: 16 Apr 2014). posted on 11 Jul 2017, 23:16. Going by your argument since this site caters to US readers why don't they review phones that US consumers can actually go out to the store and buy? What is the point in reviewing a phone that was never meant to be sold in the US in the first place and then marking that down as a con?. (Posts: 289; Member since: 02 Jul 2014). posted on 12 Jul 2017, 01:34. in response to #34 Hide. There is not much old a point reviewing it, except to compare those what is available with it...and to let people who will import it(you know it is possible to buy stuff online too, you don't have to go in to the store!?), more info about it. Anyway...being unavailable officially in US means it doesn't have service support, warranty, you as customer don't have all the rights as with stuff that is avaible in US stores (f.e. to bring it back if you don't like it and get your money). * Some comments have been hidden, because they don't meet the discussions rules..

Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Xiaomi Mi 6 was launched last month in China. It features a Snapdragon 835 SoC and 6GB of RAM. No India launch plans have been announced so far. The Xiaomi Mi 6, the Chinese company's latest flagship smartphone, was unveiled last month at an event in Beijing. The new flagship smartphone and its ceramic variant are initially exclusive to the China market, similar to their predecessors, the Xiaomi Mi 5 and Xiaomi Mi 4. The company hasn't yet announced India launch plans for the new Mi flagship, but it offered Gadgets 360 a chance to spend some time with the Xiaomi Mi 6 and Mi 6 Ceramic, and here are our first impressions.. The Xiaomi Mi 6 is very similar to the Mi 5 in terms of shape and size. The new flagship, however, looks more refined and premium with four-sided curved glass on four sides, and a frame made of stainless steel. Unlike the Xiaomi Mi 5, the Mi 6 has a fingerprint sensor under the front glass, which adds to the overall aesthetics. The new fingerprint sensor implementation by Xiaomi is in line with what other companies including Samsung are reportedly trying to achieve.. At the China launch, Xiaomi claimed that the stainless-steel enclosure is resistant to wear and tear. Additionally, the Mi 6 has a splash-resistant body, with the SIM tray also sealed against liquid damage. We expect that we will be able to get a better idea of the durability of this phone when it is more widely available.. Xiaomi Mi 6 vs Samsung Galaxy S8 vs OnePlus 3T. Xiaomi also touted the curved glass design of the Mi 6 and its high-gloss outline. In our opinion, the device does have a premium appeal. However, you will need to clean it from time to time as it clearly attracts smudges.. At 7.5mm, the Mi 6 is marginally thicker than its predecessor which measured 7.3mm. Also, the weight of 168 grams makes this phone quite a bit heavier than the Mi 5 which weighed 129 grams. It's is comfortable to use with just one hand, though we found that the glass finish was quite slippery. The Mi 6 was launched in black, white and blue, and we got a black unit version to try out.. The ceramic version is even heavier than the regular version, but looks more premium. Another highlight of the Ceramic version is its 18K gold-plated camera rims. Apart from design, there is no difference between the regular Mi 6 and the Ceramic version.. A Look at How Xiaomi Flagships Have Evolved Over the Years. The smartphone features a 5.15-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) display. It looks bright and crisp, with good viewing angles. However, this might turn out to be the phone's biggest weakness considering that it will be compared to the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6 , both of which have bigger screens with higher resolutions. It's worth pointing it out that the Mi 6 costs roughly half as much as those smartphones.. The Xiaomi Mi 6 is the company's first smartphone with no 3.5mm headphones socket, and this means that users can expect a USB-Type C to 3.5mm adaptor shipping in the retail box. The speakers are located on either side of the USB Type-C port on the bottom. The power and volume buttons are on the right, while the SIM card tray is on the left.. Top 6 Features of New Xiaomi Flagship Smartphone. One of the biggest highlights of the Mi 6 is its dual rear 12-megapixel cameras, a setup similar to that of the iPhone 7 Plus. One has a wide-angle lens and the other has a telephoto lens for lossless 2x zoom. The company claims that its binocular stereoscopic vision imaging and depth learning algorithms make edge recognition more accurate in photos. The rear cameras also feature phase-detection autofocus, and four-axis anti-shake functionality for blur reduction. The mi 6 also packs an 8-megapixel front camera with 1080p video recording capability.. In the limited time we had with the phone, we found that the Mi 6's rear cameras were quick at focusing. The dual mode is not turned on by default when you launch the camera app, but it only takes one tap. When the portrait mode (or dual mode) is selected, the phone can capture shots with the background blurred. However, the app clearly notes that the main subject shouldn't be further than 2m from the camera.. In our limited tests, some of the samples we took in portrait mode came out looking good, with the subject clear and the background blurred, without any extra effort. The samples had accurate colours and details. The low-light performance of the Mi 6's rear camera was impressive as well. The front camera was also decent, and managed to take good selfies in low light. The camera app also has a beautify feature for enhancing selfies. Stay tuned for our detailed review when we really get a chance to test the cameras under varied conditions.. The Mi 6 runs MIUI 8 based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat. The interface looked cleaner than before, and there were several Nougat features such as split-screen multitasking. The Mi 6 ships with a Smart Assistant feature that is customisable. The Smart Assistant lets users call up frequently visited places and preferences, after which it can show traffic route suggestions.. As you would expect from a flagship smartphone, the Xiaomi Mi 6 packs the latest octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor clocked at 2.4GHz, coupled with 6GB of RAM. This is only the second smartphone powered by the new Qualcomm SoC apart from the Samsung Galaxy S8. We found the phone to be responsive to our touch inputs and quick during multitasking in the limited time we spent with it. We found that there were roughly 3.8GB of RAM free when the phone was idle.. The Mi 6 has been launched in 64GB and 128GB storage options. The dual-SIM phone supports VoLTE, and both SIMs support LTE. The Mi 6 is also only the second smartphone after the Galaxy S8 to feature Bluetooth 5.0. We will reserve our verdict on the Mi 6's performance till we get the chance to put it through our detailed review process.. Final thoughts Xiaomi is yet to announce India launch plans for the Mi 6, though a representative told Gadgets 360 that there's no truth to rumours claiming that the phone won't launch here at all. We can expect the Mi 6 to be priced at around the same aggressive level as it is priced in China, in order to take on the popular OnePlus 3T .. If Xiaomi brings the Mi 6 here soon, it could be the first one with a Snapdragon 835 processor to launch in India. We will have to wait for the company's confirmation of any such plans.. The Xiaomi Mi 6 has been priced starting at CNY 2,499 (roughly Rs. 23,500) in China for the version wotj 64GB of storage and 6GB of RAM. The 128GB/6GB version has been priced at CNY 2,899 (roughly Rs. The Ceramic version has been priced at CNY 2,999 (roughly Rs. 28,000) and it has 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage..

The Mi5 proved to be a value for money all-rounder smartphone device in our test, and the company is aimed to do the same again with its all new Xiaomi Mi6. The design of the Xiaomi Mi6 is almost similar to the Mi5, the only major difference is on the rear of the device, as the device now comes with a dual-camera setup instead of one.

Xiaomis upcoming flagship smartphone the Mi 6 is starting to make the rounds with rumors stating it will be powered by theSnapdragon 835 SoC It looks like the Xiaomi Mi 6will make its debut in the month of February with sales kicking off from MarchThere are conflicting rumors regardin. Please ask the question in above box. Which processor is better MediaTek or Snapdragon?. Definitely, Snapdragon, I've been using both for a long time. Snapdragon beats MTK, especially on temperature control, stability and gaming or multimedia performance. The majority of apps on Google play store are optimized for Snapdragon. The problem is that Snapdragon is a costly SOC.. Snapdragon 835 is the world's first 10nm technology-based SoC operating at 2.45 MHz having 8 core, making it the most powerful, energy efficient and fastest processor.. There is big difference between both. Spillproof means the light splashes of water won't cause damage. However, when immersed in water it will surely die. There is a video on YouTube demonstrating this.. No, but it is a spill-proof.. Is Micromax dual 6 is better than Mi6?. Micromax dual 6 is not yet available on the market, but there is nothing to compare with Mi6. Mi6 is far ahead in technology and double the cost too.. Does it have a long lasting battery and what is the battery backup time of this mobile?. The battery life of this phone is a bit underwhelming and battery backup promises 18 hours of talk time.. Yes, and it's more than a full day with moderate use.. Yes, definitely, wait till you get to know the price in India..

Updated 11:00 AM ET Wed, 19 April 2017. The Xiaomi Mi 6 costs 2,499 yuan ($362) and will be on sale on April 28. Key specs include a dual lens camera and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor The Mi 6 is a key launch for Xiaomi following struggles in the smartphone market. Xiaomi's latest flagship phone comes with state-of-the-art tech but a lower price tag. 10:55 AM ET Wed, 19 April 2017 | 00:41. 64 GB or 128 GB storage options Dual lens rear camera with two 12 megapixel sensors Under-glass fingerprint sensor on the front No headphone jack Splash resistance. Xiaomi launched its Mi 6 flagship smartphone on Wednesday with a dual lens camera and latest processing technology, as it looks to recover after a tough year.. The Chinese technology upstart, which is one of the most valuable private companies worth a reported $45 billion, showed off the device which boasts a 5.15-inch display and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, a processor that is yet to appear only in Samsung's Galaxy S8 .. Xiaomi is selling the 64 GB Mi 6 model for 2,499 yuan ($362). The price in dollar terms is slightly above its previous Mi 5 flagship which was released in February 2016 and cost 2,699 which at the time was $354. Still Xiaomi has priced the device lower than flagships from the likes of Huawei, Apple and Samsung .. The Mi 6 is a very important phone launch for Xiaomi, a company that was once the darling of the smartphone world , showing triple-digit growth and challenging the likes of Samsung and Apple. But it has been struggling in recent years and has since looked to branch into new areas such as connected appliances.. Xiaomi's peak in China was the second quarter of 2015 where it was number one and had a 16 percent market share. By the fourth quarter of 2016, it was the fifth largest player with a market share of 7.4 percent, according to IDC data.. In a letter to staff in January, Xiaomi Chief Executive Lei Jun admitted the company grew "too fast" in the past few years leading to challenges in the business.. "2016 was a year in which we took time to catch our breaths and slow our rapid pace to make essential adjustments to our business that will enable us to go further," Jun said.. The company is targeting 100 billion yuan in revenue this year, a feat it has not achieved before.. The Xiaomi Mi 6 smartphone unveiled on April 29, 2017, in Beijing, China.. Xiaomi was struck a blow earlier this year when Hugo Barra, the executive it poached from Google in 2013 to lead its international expansion efforts, left the company to join Facebook. Xiaomi's attempt to broaden beyond China – where it still books the majority of its sales – has seen mixed success.. The electronics maker, which was once a disruptor, has seen itself face challenges in China from the likes of Oppo and Vivo which have found success from selling their devices in physical stores.. Jun has high hopes for the device which he says is the best the company has to offer.. "Mi 6 is the culmination of our seven years of research and development in the smartphone industry, and represents the pinnacle of our journey thus far," Jun said in a press release on Wednesday.. The Mi 6 will be available on Xiaomi's online store starting April 28, but won't be on sale in the U.S..

Xiaomi Mi 6 packs Snapdragon 835, dual-lens cameras, slick design for $365. Xiaomi’s long-awaited Mi 6 smartphone is here. A stunning, curvy body houses the most desirable processor out there at the moment: Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835, currently only found in the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Sony’s forthcoming Xperia XZ Premium. It’s cheaper than both these phones too, at around $365; but the same old Xiaomi problem still exists: You will have to import one to get it.. It’s a compact phone with a 5.15-inch, 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution screen. This is underneath a piece of curved glass, which extends round the back of the phone, and is matched to a stainless steel chassis. The design is an obvious evolution of the Xiaomi Mi 5, and retains the physical home button and fingerprint sensor below the display on the front. On the back there are now two camera lenses, elevating the Mi 6 to the same level as competing phones from Huawei, Honor, and LG.. The dual lenses both have 12-megapixels and operate in the same way as Apple and Huawei’s setup, allowing a 2x optical zoom and replicating the desirable bokeh blurred background effect. Xiaomi previously introduced dual-camera lenses on the Redmi Pro and the Mi 5s Plus , but neither work in exactly the same manner as the Mi 6. It’ll be interesting to see how it performs next to the Huawei P10 , which has the feature down almost to perfection. Xiaomi’s rear camera also has four-axis optical image stabilization, and brings the beautification mode seen on the 8-megapixel selfie cam to the rear cam too.. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 processor powers the Mi 6, and it’s the first phone to offer the chip in China. It’s paired with 6GB of RAM and a choice of 64GB or128GB of internal storage space. A 3,350mAh battery provides the energy, plus there’s NFC, an under-glass fingerprint sensor, stereo speakers, highly capable 2×2 MU-MIMO Wi-Fi, USB Type-C, and basic splash resistance. Android will be installed with Xiaomi’s MIUI software over the top. What’s missing? A 3.5mm headphone jack, and if we’re being difficult about things, a bezel-less display.. Xiaomi will make the Mi 6 in black, white, blue or a beautiful silver, plus a special ceramic edition with 18-karat gold camera trim, just like the limited edition. The ceramic Mi 6 will be the most expensive at the equivalent of $435 at today’s exchange rate, while the 128GB model in any other color will be around $420, and the 64GB Mi 6 will cost about $365. All will be available in China from April 28.. Updated on 04-19-2017 by Andy Boxall: Rewritten with all the official details on the Mi 6.. Here is everything we know about the Xiaomi Mi 7.

Xiaomi Mi 6 is one of the few high end smartphones from xiaomi with features like light water (splash) resistant, display with eye-care, octa-core CPU, dual 12 MP primary camera, adreno 540 GPU, 6 GB RAM, 4K video, fingerprint sensor, snapdragon 835 chipset and so on. All these features makes Xiaomi Mi 6 a feature reach phone as well as a strong powerhouse. This phone is definitely giving a big competition to Samsung and Huawei's high-end smartphones. However, Samsung with its Gear VR, Gear 360° camera, irish scanner and desktop excerience is way ahead. Xiaomi still can't compete at that level with Galaxy S8 and S8+ or overtake the camera of Google Pixel. But Xoaim Mi 6 is a strong signal that, in near future Xiaomi may also get interested in them!.
