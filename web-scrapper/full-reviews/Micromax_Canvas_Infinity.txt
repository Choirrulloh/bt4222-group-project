Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. The Canvas Infinity is a good option and puts up a decent challenge against the competition. It has a lot going for it, particularly its camera, but itâs not perfect.. Display 5.7-inch HD+ (1440 x 720) IPS. Expandable up to 128GB with microSD card. Rear Camera 13 MP with LED flash. Front Camera 16 MP with LED flash. Dimensions 152 x 9 x 73 mm. After the novelty was introduced to flagship smartphones earlier this year, screens with 18:9 aspect ratios are already trickling down to mid-range smartphones.Â. Clearly, this is the season of longer displays!. Micromax ‘s newest offering, the Canvas Infinity, the company has brought this feature to an affordable smartphone. But apart from that striking display, is the Canvas Infinity still a competent budget smartphone? Letâs find out in our comprehensive Micromax Canvas Infinity review.. The Canvas Infinity is a budget smartphone, yet there is a hint of style in its chassis. It sports a premium design and good looks, combined with great build quality. Though itâs not a metal unibody design, the Micromax uses top-quality plastic that doesnât feel cheap at all.. The phone feels great in-hand, especially because of its compact form factor. Even with a 5.7-inch display, the slim bezels and increased height make for a very comfortable phone. Itâs smaller than several smartphones in the market with 5.5-inch displays, and gives users a big screen experience without the need to lug around an unwieldy smartphone.. Micromax has done a good job in aesthetics as well as in build quality.. Overall, Micromax has done a good job in aesthetics as well as in build quality. Unlike other smartphones with large displays, the Canvas Infinity is actually comfortable to use with one hand.. The highlight of the Canvas Infinity is of course its display. Micromax offers an edge-to-edge display with 18:9 aspect ratio in a budget smartphone, and manages to be early on the trend. The 5.7-inch display sports a 1,440 x 720 resolution and the HD+ IPS LCD has a relatively low pixel density of around 282 ppi. While the colors are bright and vibrant, there is a definite lack of sharpness. The extra screen real estate makes for an immersive video or gaming experience, but the lack of details are a tad disappointing.. Micromax has done well to offer a large and tall display in a compact form factor. Itâs not perfect, but a lot of users won’t mind.. Powered by the older Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processor, the Canvas Infinity is not built to be a powerhouse. With 3 GB of RAM on board, it does not stutter in everyday usage, even with multiple apps and background processes.. When you stretch it though, there are occasional lags or frame drops. For a budget smartphone, I did not mind the performance â even playing graphics-intensive games worked okay. Itâs not a device built for multitasking or power users of any kind. Some apps that need a little more processing power, like Facebook, would take a couple of seconds extra to load or refresh. But this is to be expected.. The good news is that even when stretched, it doesnât get hot. During extended gaming sessions or while charging, it gets a little warm, but it never gets uncomfortable.. Powered by the older Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processor, the Canvas Infinity is not built to be a powerhouse.. The 720p display and the modest processor means that the Canvas Infinity manages to squeeze a dayâs worth of battery life from the 2,900 mAh battery it packs. Itâs not exemplary, but should be good enough for most people. Thereâs 32 GB of internal storage, with a microSD slot for extending the storage by up to 128 GB.. The Canvas Infinity packs in modest internals, but does a good job in extracting decent performance out of them. Most casual users will enjoy the seamless experience, but power users and specs sheet watchers will want more.. The Micromax Canvas Infinity sports a removable back panel allowing you to replace the battery, an uncommon feature in 2017. The device also features separate slots for two SIM cards as well as a microSD card, so you donât have to make a choice between the second SIM and expandable storage.. Thereâs a fingerprint sensor at the back that is fairly accurate and quick to unlock the phone. It is one of the best performing fingerprint sensors Iâve seen on a budget smartphone.. While the 18:9 display is the companyâs sole pitch for the device, its camera is the surprise standout of the Canvas Infinity.. The 13 MP rear camera with f/2.0 aperture trumps most smartphones in its price segment. Outdoors in daylight, it manages to take some great shots with quite good color saturation and an okay amount of detail.. The camera is the surprise standout of the Micromax Canvas Infinity.. In low light conditions, the photos are a hit-and-miss. While the color reproduction is good enough, the photos turn out a bit grainy.. Incidentally, the 16 MP front camera fares better, even in lighting conditions that are less than ideal. The color reproduction is accurate and it captures decent amount of details for your selfies to get enough likes (and validation) on social media.. The camera app on the Canvas Infinity is pretty good too. It features a portrait mode for both cameras that blurs out the background for the subject (you) to stand out. In most cases, itâs unnatural and artificial though, but I see a lot of people enjoying that – if my Facebook timeline is any indication. Thereâs also a feature called Super Pixel which takes multiple shots simultaneously and combines them to give a higher resolution photo. Some of these came out pretty good, but, again, they looked artificial.. Micromax has done well to offer decent imaging capabilities and an especially generous selfie camera. Not every shot will be great, so expect a few blurry or grainy photos, but at the price the Canvas Infinity comes at, you knew that already.. The Canvas Infinity runs on Android 7.1.2 Nougat , which would have been good if Micromax hadn’t chosen to hide the Nougat goodness under the companyâs own âMy Launcherâ.. The custom skin is responsible for most of the performance issues you may encounter with the device. It is buggy, and pre-installed apps ask for critical permissions randomly. Then thereâs the Apps Center that throws up ads as notifications. My Launcher aims to mimic the iOS UI, as is apparent with the icons and the Settings app. Iâm not really sure how this UI was approved at the drawing board but it’s a mess.. Also, thereâs a plethora of bloatware, including the random addition of the Indian Prime Ministerâs personal app. There are a few neat additions like Smart Actions and Smart Gestures, as well as a one-handed mode which is quite handy.. The Canvas Infinity is a big letdown in terms of software, and one should really opt for a third-party launcher. The good thing is that it packs the latest iteration of Android Nougat, and the company has announced that the smartphone will get the Android 8.0 Oreo update soon.. The Micromax Canvas Infinity is one of the best-looking smartphones in its price segment, and the novelty of a display with an 18:9 aspect ratio is a great addition. The camera is a surprise standout too.. The Canvas Infinity is a capable budget smartphone, with more than one thing going for it.. If you’re not looking for raw power, it will serve you well. Its only downside, and a major one at that, is its frustrating software experience.. At â¹9,999 ($154) in India, the Micromax Canvas Infinity is a good option and puts up a decent challenge against the competition. It has a lot going for it, but itâs not perfect..

News Micromax Canvas Infinity Review: It’s all about the screen. Micromax Canvas Infinity Review: It’s all about the screen. The Micromax Canvas Infinity brings a large screen with an 18:9 aspect ratio, but can the rest of the phone keep up?. Published: August 28, 2017 12:22 PM IST. Wide aspect ratio screens on smartphones are no longer a thing of the past, with Samsung and LG already in the market with phones that boast of an 18:9 or higher aspect ratio. Many upcoming phones are expected to launch with wider-than-usual screens, including the upcoming Apple iPhone 8. It’s no surprise then that manufacturers are preparing for the inevitable shift to wider screens, and one such manufacturer is India’s own Micromax.. With an aim to bring the wide-screen and good looks that come with it to the masses, Micromax has launched the Rs 9,999 Canvas Infinity. With a 5.7-inch 18:9 aspect ratio screen, the Micromax Canvas Infinity has a bigger screen, but is there more to the phone apart from the dominating display? We’ve reviewed the phone, so read on to find out.. With its 18:9 5.7-inch screen, the Micromax Canvas Infinity boasts striking good looks at the front. Although the non-screen space at the sides is about the same as you’d expect on any smartphone, the difference can really be seen below and above the screen. There’s very little space in both these places, including no capacitive buttons at the bottom and the speaker grille, proximity sensor and front camera squeezed in at the top. The curved corners of the screen also add to the look and design of the phone.. As a result of the reduced non-screen space, the Micromax Canvas Infinity manages to squeeze in a 5.7-inch screen while being slightly smaller than a typical 5.5-inch screen phone such as the OnePlus 5. The phone doesn’t feel too big, and will appeal to buyers on a low budget looking for a phone with a bigger screen that doesn’t feel quite as big.. While the competing LG Q6 disposes of the fingerprint sensor, the Micromax Canvas Infinity manages to include this now-expected feature. The sensor is at the back of the phone, and is fairly accurate and quick to unlock the phone, with very little delay between the phone accepting your fingerprint and actually waking and unlocking the phone. Other key advantages of the Micromax Canvas Infinity is the fact that the battery is replaceable under the removable back panel, and there are separate slots for both SIM cards and a microSD card, which means that you can have two SIMs and expandable storage on the phone as well.. With 4G connectivity and support for VoLTE, the Micromax Canvas Infinity is also suitably well set when it comes to connecting to data networks. You also get 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage out of the box, which isn’t often seen on smartphones priced at under Rs 10,000. The phone comes with Android Nougat 7.1.2 out of the box, with a single-layered user interface on top. The Android navigation keys are on-screen, and the icons, settings menu and styling closely resemble those on iOS. It’s fairly well laid out and doesn’t have too much bloat; just a handful of apps are pre-installed (Amazon, Asphalt Nitro and surprisingly, the Narendra Modi app), and these can be uninstalled easily. ALSO READ: LG Q6 Review. The Micromax Canvas Infinity comes with a 16-megapixel front camera. Although there’s no flash, the high resolution of the camera allows for decent pictures, even in lighting conditions that are less than ideal. There are a couple of additional modes as well, including real-time bokeh with the front camera, and super pixel technology. Additionally, you can reduce the overall resolution to allow for 18:9 aspect ratio pictures, which uses the entire screen as the viewfinder for the camera and takes wide shots. Pictures are sharp and well composed, and although the bokeh uses software to determine depth-of-field rather than a dual-camera setup, the results are interesting enough.. (Camera Samples shot with the front camera of the Micromax Canvas Infinity). For all of its pros, the Micromax Canvas Infinity comes with as many cons, if not more. The first significant shortcoming is in the screen resolution; the Micromax Canvas Infinity has an HD+ resolution screen, with a resolution of 720×1440 pixels. The pixel density ratio is around 282 pixels-per-inch, which is rather low and this lack of sharpness shows. Although the screen is decent when it comes to color and brightness, the low detail will be noticeable, particularly when gaming or watching videos, which would ordinarily be the key benefits of the large, wide screen of the Micromax Canvas Infinity.. The phone is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 SoC, a basic chipset that is also seen on the Xiaomi Redmi 4A, a phone that costs Rs 5,999. Indeed, the chipset is meant for basic entry-level smartphones at best, and the lack of capability in performance does show. During my time with the phone, I often experienced stutter and unpleasant lag, even with three or four apps running.. Gaming with graphics-intensive games is pleasant as long as you don’t keep too many other apps running in the background, and there is a slight amount of heat generated during intensive tasks. Certain apps, including the pre-installed Asphalt Nitro, did crash on occasion when other apps were also running. While the phone can handle most tasks with only the sacrifice of low frame-rate or the occasional frame drop, the slow loading times and stutter means that it’s meant for basic use at best.. The rear camera of the Micromax Canvas Infinity is a 13-megapixel shooter capable of recording video at up to 1080p resolution. However, pictures aren’t quite as good as they can get, particularly due to a fair amount of grain on shots even in good lighting conditions. Detail takes a hit, and colors tend to wash out as well. With the price in mind, pictures aren’t bad but aren’t particularly good either.. (Camera Samples shot with the rear camera of the Micromax Canvas Infinity). Battery life is again, just about average. On occasion, you may be able to run the phone for a full day on a single charge, but it usually drains out before the day is over. Considering that the phone is powered by the otherwise frugal Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 SoC, this comes across as a bit of a disappointment.. The Micromax Canvas Infinity may be a budget phone at heart and by price, and when it comes to performance, there’s absolutely no doubt of its credentials. It’s a basic phone at best and doesn’t quite perform to the standards of the similarly priced Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. Additionally, just an HD resolution for a 5.7-inch screen also has its shortcomings, as the screen isn’t very sharp.. But if you can get around those shortcomings, the Micromax Canvas Infinity is among the better looking smartphones you can buy at under Rs 10,000. The front-filling screen and lack of non-screen space make for a good looking device, while 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, a removable battery and separate slots for both SIMs and a microSD card only serve to sweeten the deal. It’s definitely worth looking at for these reasons, but if you want a more powerful device that serves your usage needs better, you’ll be better served by the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4..

Today in New Delhi , India. Metro cities - Delhi Mumbai Chennai Kolkata. Other cities - Noida Gurgaon Bengaluru Hyderabad Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Lucknow Patna Ranchi. Micromax Canvas Infinity first impressions: A Samsung Galaxy S8-like display for Rs 9,999. Micromax aims to bring the premium display experience to masses with the Canvas Infinity. Read our detailed hands-on to know more about the smartphone. Updated: Aug 22, 2017 19:44 IST. Is Micromax Canvas Infinity the best looking Micromax smartphone so far?. ‘Bezel-less’ displays have actually become a thing. From the Essential Phone to Xiaomi Mi Mix, there are quite a few smartphones that come with near bezel-less displays. Samsung and LG have also experimented with the concept with their latest flagship smartphones, the Galaxy S8 and LG G6, respectively. OEMs’ newfound obsession with bezel-less displays indicate that the market will be soon flooded with such smartphones. But at the moment, we can safely say bezel-less or near bezel-less smartphones segment to be precise, are niche.. This is exactly what Micromax is trying to tap into – delivering a smartphone that mimics Samsung Galaxy S8’s ‘Infinity Display’ and costs less than Rs 10,000. After all, Micromax’s strength has been catering to the ‘masses’. The Micromax Canvas Infinity is priced at Rs 9,999 and perhaps is one of the best looking Micromax smartphones thus far. But is that it about the Canvas Infinity? Well, the 18:9 is the main deal of the Canvas Infinity, but the smartphone does tick all the checkboxes for a decent sub-Rs 10,000 smartphone. Ahead of today’s launch, I briefly used the Micromax Canvas Infinity and here are my first impressions.. Without a doubt the Micromax Canvas Infinity is very good looking. The 18:9 ‘full vision’ display-screen makes all the difference. The display feels taller as you would have noticed in other smartphones with slimmer bezels. The Canvas Infinity has a 5.7-inch IPS HD display (an impressive 80% screen-to-body ratio), quite close to Samsung Galaxy S8’s 5.8-inch screen. Unsurprisingly, the Canvas Infinity does remind you of the Galaxy S8 from the front. During my brief usage, the display seemed bright enough while colour and saturation levels were decent enough.. Micromax Canvas Infinity boasts of 18:9 display.. The similarity with the Galaxy S8 ends here though. The back panel is removable and houses slots for microSD and two SIM cards. Even though it’s a plastic back panel, it doesn’t really come across as cheap. In fact, the design very well gels with the front. Though it makes me wonder should Micromax have gone ahead with a unibody design? What difference would it have made? Overall, the smartphone feels good enough when you hold it in your hands. All the necessary buttons like volume rocker and power button are well within the reach. Perhaps, people with smaller palms than mine may take some time to get used a taller smartphone. If someone has already been using a 5.5-inch or larger screen smartphone, switching to the Canvas Infinity should not be a problem.. The Canvas Infinity has a removable back panel.. Another major highlight of the smartphone is the 16-megapixel front facing camera. The camera is capable of delivering a ‘real-time’ Bokeh effect (DSLR-like depth of field) for selfies. I tried out this mode for a few selfies, most of them came out really well. The 13-megapixel rear camera seemed pretty fine as well. Wait for a more detailed take on the camera performance once we have reviewed the smartphone.. As far as performance goes, it felt pretty fluid during the time I spent with the device. The smartphone runs on Android 7.1.2 Nougat out-of-the-box. Micromax has said that the Canvas Infinity will receive Android 8.0 Oreo update as well. The company has also promised regular updates to the smartphone. It is worth noting that Android users have long demanded regular updates from the OEMs. Already, Nokia has been touting the ‘Android update’ as one of their USPs for their smartphones. That being said, the combination of Snapdragon 425 processor and 3GB of RAM may be inferior to what Xiaomi and Lenovo have been offering for their phones in the budget category. But I am not expecting the Canvas Infinity to be a powerhouse anyway. The Canvas Infinity comes with a 2,900mAh battery, smaller than Redmi Note 4’s 4,000mAh battery. But it’s not the mAh capacity alone that decides the battery life. We’ll be providing more in-depth details on the battery life once the smartphone has gone through a barrage of tests.. Summing up, the 18:9 display is indeed the main deal of the Canvas Infinity. At Rs 9,999, there’s barely any smartphone that offers the same display experience. LG, however, also offers a budget smartphone with an 18:9 display. Perhaps, the LG Q6 is superior to the Canvas Infinity, but it costs higher as well. The pricing of the LG Q6 starts at Rs 14,990, approximately Rs 5,000 more than the Canvas Infinity..

I bought it in Amazon last month in the mindset of supporting indian producr. A good come back for Micromax in the market. Pros: Good full vision display main reason y chose it. Nougat os and assured Oreo update from mm. Camera front 16mp with flash doing good for more than the money given. Decent back cam with 13mp is better taking better than front under flash. Bokeh effect is ok but not equal to potrairt. Finger print is fast enough but 9/10 times accurate. Battery is good with 1 day assured backup for moderate use and 15-18hrs for heavy usage. Premium look and metal body, good to hold. Within 24hr service or replacement guarantee by mm. 3gb ram with Snapdragon 425 1.4ghz ok for moderate games not for heavy games. No heat prblm till now.No hanging prblm till now after installing around 20 apps. CONS: No full HD screen only hd plus which is ok for this price. Speaker is not that much loud. Little heavy feel to hold which is habituated to use within a week. 720 * 1440 pixels display is not playing not full screen videos in YouTube otherthan that camera video MX player n live TV playing full screen. App centre notifications not clearing untill we open that which is annoying. Go for it if your budget is under 10k.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Delighting.

Tech Blog with a focus on personal and consumer technology. The best place for meaningful tech news, analysis, views and reviews.. Micromax Canvas Infinity Review: The Joker in the 18:9 Display Pack. Who said 18:9 is the preserve of the premium?. “Why so serious about the specs, check the display”. The camera is no joke! The rest…ah. That price: “I took a white knight, and brought him to our level”. Do I really look like a guy with a plan, Harvey? I don’t have a plan … The mob has plans. I am just the wrench in the gears. Yours, theirs, everyones… Schemers trying to control their worlds….Introduce a little anarchy, you upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos… I am an agent of chaos. Heath Ledger (aka the Joker, the Dark Knight). That monologue by Heath Ledger playing a very demented Joker in The Dark Knight is one of the most famous monologues of our time. It has become – rather ironically (considering it came from a master criminal) – a rallying point for those who oppose the ‘regular’ way of things. And well, we could hear it playing right through our heads when we used the Micromax Canvas Infinity.. For actually, that is exactly what the Micromax Canvas Infinity is. At a time when a number of brands are trying to make the 18:9 aspect ratio display a premium offering, others are doggedly trying to make it available at lower prices. And while the likes of LG (with the Q6) and Honor (9i) have done well in this latter objective, nothing has yanked the new display into the mainstream as the Micromax Canvas Infinity has.. When the Canvas Infinity was unveiled, we had said that it was the first indication – REAL indication – that the company that was once a formidable competitor in the Indian smartphone market was going back to basics. Basics that revolved around offering features that were seen on high-end devices at surprisingly affordable prices. With the Canvas Infinity, the company took aim squarely at the 18:9 aspect, almost bezel-less (on the side) display, which at the time of its release was largely limited to Samsung and LG’s flagships, which came with premium price tags. With the passage of time, other players have joined the 18:9 bezel-less race, but the Canvas Infinity remains the most disruptive of the lot.. And the reason for this is its price tag, which at Rs 9,999, makes it by far the most affordable of the 18:9 display group (the LG Q6 comes second at a price that is almost 50 percent higher at Rs 14,999 – read our review of that worthy here ). No, its spec sheet – Qualcomm Snapdragon 425, 3 GB RAM, 32 GB storage (expandable, with a dedicated memory card slot), 13.0-megapixel rear camera, 16.0-megapixel selfie camera, dual-SIM connectivity, 4G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, all topped off with Android Nougat (7.1.2) with Micromax’s relatively bare UI on top – is not going to make eyebrows rise. But yes, even at a relatively modest 1440 x 720 resolution, that 5.7-inch 18:9 aspect ration display will grab attention.. It is that display that gives this device a premium feel ( check our initial impressions to know more about its appearance). Yes, there will be those who will turn their noses up at the removable plastic back, but honestly, the Canvas Infinity punches well above its weight in the looks department, thanks to that display. No, it is not as poppy and bright as some displays we have seen in this price segment and at 1440 x 720 resolution is not the sharpest we have seen (the LG Q6 and Honor 9i have a 2160 x 1080 displays), but it is the most distinct at its price point, and is good enough for watching videos, social networks, and Web pages. And that aspect ratio makes the Canvas Infinity surprisingly compact (it is more easy to handle than the iPhone 8 Plus which has a smaller display) and easy to use even with one hand. This is the most distinct – if not the best – looking phone with a four-figure price tag, laying siege even to the dark and lovely Redmi Note 4’s black avatar.. But if the display is the apparent star, the dark horse is the rear camera. Ironically, Micromax talked more of the 16.0-megapixel selfie shooter with a flash on the device, but we found the rear camera often surprising us with some very good photographs. No, it is no low light star but in good light conditions, it time and again surprised us with its detail and color reproduction. The front-facing camera, on the other hand, is a bit of a disappointment with plenty of noise entering the equation. Micromax has thrown in a portrait mode in both selfie and normal photograph mode, but the results are nothing to rave about. But yes, as a simple point and shooter, the Canvas Infinity is a contender.. Which is about the end of the good news. With the specs it possesses, the Canvas Infinity is more of a steady performer than a superb one. It is good enough for basic tasks, social networking, games like Candy Crush Saga and browsing the Web, but push it into heavy gaming and frame drops and lags do not just creep in, but actually, make themselves at home. Call quality is good, though, although we would have appreciated louder sound off that loudspeaker, which is right at the back of the device (so keeping it on a table mutes the sound a little). Battery life is about middling – even with a relatively smaller 2900 mAh battery, the phone is able to see off a day of routine to heavy usage (high-end gaming not being an option, we used the phone mainly for watching videos and lots of surfing), thanks we suspect to the display not being a full HD affair. Those spoiled by the massive batteries of the Redmi Note 4 and Redmi 4 will, however, feel a trifle disappointed. We liked Micromax’s relatively unobtrusive UI, though (no app drawer), notwithstanding a few crashes – the settings panel takes some getting used to but all in all, it is straightforward enough and not blessed with as much bloatware as some of its predecessors. We do hope it gets the Android O update soon.. Which brings us to the big question? Should you be thinking of investing Rs 9,999 in the Micromax Canvas Infinity? Well, if Rs 10,000 is where your budget ends and you want a device that looks good and has a decent camera, the answer is yes. It definitely looks way more futuristic than anything in its price range and will not look out of place with even higher priced contemporaries. Those looking for sheer performance might find the Lenovo K8 Plus (our current sub-Rs 10,000 favourite) and the Redmi Note 4 to be much better propositions. But for those seeking just a good looking device with middling performance and a good camera, the Infinity is a heck of an option. And it certainly throws a spanner in the works of every manufacturer who is bringing an 18:9 aspect display phone in the market at a higher price tag – it just ripped the premium price tag off that display.. It is not perfect but punches above its weight in price terms. And in best Micromax tradition, the Canvas Infinity makes a perceived premium feature (the 18:9 display) fair game for anyone on a tight budget.. And in best Joker tradition too. Do you know how he ends the monologue we referred to at the outset of this review?. And you know the thing about chaos, Harvey? It is FAIR.. Last updated by Nimish Dubey , on 23-Oct-17.

Until last month, all budget smartphones looked pretty much the same. LG broke that cycle with the Q6. The phone brought the most desirable design feature from the company’s flagship, called the Full Vision display, to a more affordable segment. While the LG Q6 looks good, its performance isn't great. Now though, there is a new smartphone on the block from Micromax, offering similar design at an even more affordable price, and it is called the Micromax Canvas Infinity. The phone packs decent hardware and is a potent contender in its category. However, there is more to discuss.. The Canvas Infinity is all about its display, so let’s begin with that. The phone features an edge-to-edge display with an aspect ratio of 18:9, similar to the one we saw earlier on the LG Q6. While the IPS LCD is bright enough for all kinds of lighting conditions, the 1440 x 720p resolution does look a little stretched out on the 5.7-inch display. The display also has a slightly cooler colour tone and does not look as good (side-by-side) to similarly priced phones in its category.. NOTE: While our original test unit had a dead pixel on the display, the issue is not there on the new unit sent to us by Micromax. That said, there’s still minor light bleeding and the UI issues concerning privacy have not been addressed. The bugs in the UI though have been fixed, and there were no crashes this time. We also didn’t have to restart the new unit frequently.. Our test unit also had some minor light bleeding issues, along with one dead pixel. However, assuming that this was just an issue with our test unit, I can say that Micromax has done a decent job of bringing this kind of display to the sub-10K segment, albeit with some flaws.. The UI on the other hand is a total disaster in my books. Instead of using the simpler stock interface, which Micromax has used on previous phones, we have a custom skin running on top of Android 7.1.2 Nougat. The whole UI is ridiculously buggy and makes the phone freeze from time to time. All pre-installed apps ask for critical permissions to manage your phone calls, contacts, camera, etc. For example, the camera app requires permission to make calls, which should not be required in the first place. I’ve flagged this in earlier Micromax phones as well, but the company seems to be continuing with it any way.. If the UI wasn't enough of an annoyance, you also have apps such as the “App center”, and “system update”, that keep populating your notification panel, suggesting apps and showing adverts. These apps already take critical permissions from you (mentioned earlier) as soon as you turn on the phone for the first time. You can’t uninstall them and at best you can block all notifications. Micromax has also added a theme manager called “Personalise” to the UI, that is literally empty. Overall, it seems the UI is just put in place for advertising purposes and in the process has left out some essential things, like baking the critical permissions in the UI itself.. The Canvas Infinity is essentially a budget smartphone and it feels like one for the most part. Micromax has used an old school approach to build quality here. While the back is made of metal, it is actually just a metal plate on top of a plastic holder, and the entire rear housing can be removed to reveal a removable battery. Further, instead of SIM trays, you get access to dedicated SIM slots under the back, along with a dedicated microSD card slot, which supports upto 128GB. Now, some people may like the removable back and battery solution, but some may criticize it as well. From a fair bit use, I think that Micromax has done a good enough job and the phone seems sturdy enough.. The beautiful 5.7-inch display uses 2.5D curved glass on top, but no oleophobic coating, which makes it quite resistive to swipes. However, the new taller stance and slimmer bezels around the display results in a more compact overall footprint. This means the device is easier to use in one hand, even with that large display.. The Micromax Canvas Infinity features an older Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 SoC, which seems out of place in the budget segment in 2017. However, Micromax has done a decent job by eking out most of the processing power from it. While the erratic UI takes the shine out of the phone's performance by giving the user a sluggish UI, the phone does a really good job with gaming. I tested games like Asphalt 8 and Vainglory, which are both graphically intensive games and neither felt unresponsive. I did see an occasional frame drop or two, but that is about it, and quite acceptable from budget devices. What’s not acceptable is that day-to-day performance is not very smooth and even common apps like Facebook, SMS or even the camera sometimes take a couple of seconds to load. The phone is equally laggy when switching between apps, which again seems like the UI’s doing.. In terms of calling quality, the Micromax Canvas Infinity stands at par with most budget phones out there. The earpiece is aptly loud and the so is rear mounted single speaker. Audio quality via the headphones on the other hand isn't particularly amazing. It is flat and not loud enough.. After further testing I stand by the initial impression about the battery life of the device. The 2900mAh battery, 720p screen resolution and a not so powerful SoC, combine to provide a day's worth of battery life and should be sufficient for most people. However, if you are a mobile gaming enthusiast, or like to stream a lot of movies on your device, you may want to carry a power bank around. I didn't observe any heating issues. The phone does get a little warm while charging and during gaming, but nothing that would be described as uncomfortable or extraordinary.. While the performance of the phone is marred by its UI, the two cameras on the phone do a really commendable job. The 13MP rear camera on the device is one of the best we have seen in this category. It captures decent details and the colour saturation is almost accurate. Like any other budget camera phone, the Infinity doesn’t excel in low light. In such conditions, images tend to turn a bit grainy, but the phone manages to retain most of the subject details and colours without compromising on overall quality. You also have a Super pixel mode, which actually doubles the image size of the same subject and the intent here is to add more details. It’s not very useful and I’d recommend sticking to images clicked via the normal mode.. The front facing 16MP camera does an even better job. It captures decent amount of details and has close to source colour reproduction. It doesn’t soften skin tones, which is something we have seen from many other selfie-centric devices. However, you do have a beauty mode if you like to alter the skin tone or smoothen blemishes. The camera app features a portrait mode, which works with a slight lag and produces unnatural blur. Nevertheless, it will make for some dramatic photos for sharing on social media. Micromax’s software is limited to one person though, meaning if you try to click a selfie with a friend on portrait mode, the software may blur your friend’s face. The portrait mode is available for both front and rear cameras.. Overall, I think Micromax has done a good job, bringing decent camera quality to the budget segment. I would have loved the camera more, if it could take back to back images without a pause.. The Micromax Canvas Infinity simply put is a good smartphone, marred only by a frustrating UI. If Micromax could get rid of the UI, we might have a really good sub-10K competitor in our hands. The phone has the looks, offers good battery life, stable gaming performance and the two cameras are most likely the best set of shooters you would find in the sub-10K smartphone category. If Micromax’s replacement review unit can solve the display issues, this phone is indeed recommendable.. The sub-10K smartphone segment is a tough place to be. Phones like the Xiaomi Redmi range or the Lenovo K6 Power have reaffirmed their worth time and time again and still remain at the top of the category. However, the Micromax Canvas Infinity puts up a fair challenge and is better is some aspects, including the camera. I also believe that the Infinity is now the best looking phone under 10000. The performance and UI need some work, but if you can live with a slightly slow phone, the Canvas Infinity should serve you well. It has excellent cameras, good performance and a 18:9 display..

Micromax Canvas Infinity review: Will it be the Micromax's game-changer?. Micromax is an Indian smartphone brand that has been unable to attract consumers' attention, however, with the launch of its latest handset, the Canvas Infinity, it hopes to revive its brand value.. Updated: Tuesday, August 29, 2017, 16:37 [IST]. Micromax Canvas Infinity first impression: A device with a stunning design and competitive. Micromax has continued to be one of the most trusted Indian smartphone brands for over a decade now. Not only has it proffered consumers in the country with inexpensive handsets that feature competing specifications, it has also started shipping smartphones overseas to countries including UAE, Sri Lanka, Russia and Bangladesh.. By 2010 Micromax had established itself as one of the largest and most popular domestic brands in India. The brand came out as the tenth largest smartphone vendor in the world by the third quarter of 2014. The domestic brand earned immense popularity with Hugh Jackman as its brand ambassador promoting the Canvas line up.. However, in the last couple of years, the brand has witnessed a decline in the sales of its devices. Blame the entry of Chinese manufacturers of the likes of Gionee, Oppo, and Vivo that offer better UI and specifications in similar price range. Resultant, Micromax failed to keep up with its rivals and its revenue suffered badly.. Micromax is now trying to curb the competition coming in from the neighboring country. It has recently launched few devices that not only look and feel great in hands but also try to impart a better performance to consumers.. Its latest device Canvas Infinity offers a large screen with a design that tries to minimize the bezel. 9,999 in India and will be available for sale exclusively on Amazon.in. The big question that every gadget enthusiast has in mind is, 'Can Canvas Infinity turn the game in the favor of Micromax by offering a competitive performance'. That is what we will try to answer while we review the device. So, without further ado, let's go ahead with it.. The device offers a 5.7-inch IPS LCD capacitive HD display. It is powered by Quad-core Qualcomm MSM8917 Snapdragon 425 CPU clocked to 1.4 GHz coupled with 3GB of RAM. It has a f/2.0 camera with 13 MP sensor on the rear while a 16MP snapper at front. It has single LED flash for both cameras. The device has a 2,900 mAh battery.. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!. Design: Extremely appealing Camera: Decent specifications with commendable performance Performance: Good for day to day use but not a gamer's delight Software and UI: Promises Oreo update Display: Beautifully designed and responsive Battery and fingerprint sensor: Insufficient power backup Conclusion: A stunner with some room for improvement. Micromax Canvas Infinity has a glossy front panel with a micro speaker placed on top accompanied by a single LED flash and front camera on the either sides. A notification LED rests on top as well. The rear panel has a close to the matte finish and although it looks like it has a unibody design the rear panel comes off. It is worth mentioning here that the device has a metallic rear panel.. The rear camera, LED flash and fingerprint sensor are aligned in a single line. The speakers are behind the grills on the bottom of the rear panel. The speaker grills are unlike any other device in the price range and have circular cavities.. Power toggle and volume rockers are positioned on the right side edge. A 3.5 mm audio jack is on top while a micro USB 2.0 port rests at the lower edge.. The smartphone's front panel has an attractive design. The screen corners, similar to the corners of the smartphone, are rounded. The device derives 'Infinity' in its name from the display that tries to outdo the bezel and succeeds to a fair level. Although, the overall front look is not as minimalistic as you might have noticed in pictures shared by Micromax.. The device has a large screen but the width is trimmed down enough to make it easy for one-hand use. It feels great in hands and is also considerably slim. I really loved the design and none the less it attracted the. attention of several of my friends and acquaintances.. Micromax Canvas Infinity has a 13MP rear camera with single LED flash. The camera offers aperture value of f/2.0 which makes it capable enough to click decently lit pictures indoors. Its front camera is a 16MP snapper that offers myriads of features that include 'Beauty' mode and a more appealing 'Portrait' mode.. The camera app offers several filters that are now available on almost every other device in the price range. It proffers a 'Super Pixel' mode which we have already seen on YU Yureka Black, a Micromax undertaking. However, what's different on Canvas Infinity is the fact that the feature is a lot quicker.. The 'Portrait' mode on the device is something not noticed very frequently on competing devices. It allows users to click pictures with a considerable amount of bokeh. The camera has a feebly effective HDR mode, although the image quality is not too distorted. Talking of image quality, the pictures developed are sharp enough and retain quality.. All said and done, the camera is amply intriguing and the camera app is not too clustered with modes and filters. Folks who are not too obsessed with photography using smartphone will find it good for everyday use.. Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 Soc enjoys a reputation of its own. Canvas Infinity has coupled it with 3GB of RAM which gives it a better performance as compared to smartphones in the same price segment from Gionee, Oppo, and Vivo.. Canvas Infinity tries to match up to Xiaomi Redmi 4 and if it was not for octa-core Snapdragon 435 on the latter, Infinity would have certainly been at par with the best performing device in the segment. However, Redmi Note 4 offers 2GB RAM for the base model priced close to Rs. 10,000 while Canvas Infinity has 3GB of RAM.. As far as the performance of the device is concerned, there was. a minimal lag in opening even heavy apps. Switching between apps was also quite convenient. The device certainly isn't capable of running mid-high end games. I tried running Mortal Combat 5 on the device and the graphical performance was not close to satisfying. The Adreno 308 GPU's performance is questionable.. It handles low-mid graphical content all too well without a glitch. So the device is not what a serious gamer is looking for.. Micromax Canvas Infinity runs Android Nougat 7.1.1. This is nothing extraordinary for a smartphone priced in 10K segment. However, Micromax has promised that the device will receive Oreo update once the OS is widely available.. The user interface of the device is quite a catch. It offers several features to users that include gesture and motion control. Micromax has given the UI a very similar look and feel of iOS which makes it handy to use.. The device has a 5.7-inch display with 279 ppi pixel density. It has a resolution of 720 x 1440 pixels and the display is HD. The rounded corners of the display itself impart a really appealing look to the device. The screen is amply lit and the contrast ratio is impressive for a 10k device. The sharpness and clarity are also commendable. Video playback on the device is more than just subtle with a well saturated and distinctive performance. Daylight performance of the display is not too appreciable in harsh sunlight however in shady conditions the display is more than visible.. Movie buffs and YouTube enthusiasts will love the device for its display.. The battery on the device is a 2,900mAh powerhouse. The capacity is not too much and we have seen smartphones with batteries above 4,000mAh capacity. However, the device lasts throughout the day easily if used humbly.. Gaming and video playback certainly drains it out quickly which reduces the battery backup to 6-8 hours. Charging time of the battery, on the other hand, is not satisfactory. It takes close to 3 hours to pack up.. Fingerprint sensor of the device is quick and responsive. It is amply accurate and easy for fingers to locate.. The Micromax Canvas Infinity is a great looking device. When it comes to look and design, it has offered something fresh in the price segment and is quite ahead of its rivals for that matter. If you are looking for a smartphone with a great design and look canvas Infinity certainly rests your search.. While the device is not what serious gamers would be interested in, its performance is pretty impressive. It will never give up on you while you use several apps simultaneously on it. The battery also lasts sufficiently enough. But users who need a hard core battery performance should look for a better device.. Micromax is certainly reviving its product line up with competitive devices and Canvas Infinity is certainly a competitor. There you have a good looking, well performing device with an impressive UI that lasts sufficiently long.. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!.

Micromax Canvas Infinity design and display review. The Canvas Infinity has a premium design and combines good looks with great build quality, thanks to the combination of the taller display with the 18:9 aspect ratio. While the phone doesn’t feature a metal unibody design (actually, the back is removable in nature), it’s far more premium-feeling than holding the LG Q6, which has the plastic back. The one downside to the design is the rear panel which is hard to remove.. The Canvas Infinity’s 5.7-inch display is taller than most smartphones with the same size. Micromax says it has done away with bezels in favour of more screen real estate. This is made possible by the 18:9 display that has a resolution of 1440 x 720, all thanks to the odd aspect ratio. Compared to the phone with a 16:9 aspect ratio, the phone is not only easy to use with one hand, its narrow dimensions make it easy to stretch your thumb across the screen. The extra screen space is makes watching movies and playing games more immersive than ever.. As far as the screen’s quality is concerned, the LCD display is vibrant and detailed, but muted colours might pop up at times. Remember that the Canvas Infinity’s display is just 720p and lags behind competition like the Lenovo K8 Note and Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 in terms of quality. The Canvas Infinity by far has the best fingerprint sensor I have ever used on an affordable smartphone and unlocks the phone in seconds.. As far as its performance is concerned, it is fairly acceptable for day-to-day use. The phone uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processor with 3GB RAM. Fortunately, I felt the phone to be snappy as it easily handled multiple apps and processes in the background. The Canvas Infinity has 32GB of storage, with a microSD slot for extending that by up to 128GB.. Real world usage of the Canvas Infinity was smooth, but the phone does struggle a lot when running some of the demanding games like Real Racing and Asphalt and among others. Then again, you need to remember that it does retail for less than Rs 10,000.. Micromax Canvas Infinity software and battery review. The Canvas Infinity runs on Android 7.1.2 Nougat, though it’s not a pure form of Android. Tweaks have been made to accommodate the taller 18:9 display. Pre-loaded apps are there but the company does a great job in keeping the interface clean. Battery life on the Canvas Infinity is good if not the best ; it lasted anywhere close to 9 hours on a single charge. If you are constantly taking photos and uploading them on Facebook and Instagram, you will end up using juice more often. Again, in the real world you will find it performs better than this. The Canvas Infinity is backed by a 2900mAh battery.. Also read : Micromax Canvas Infinity first impressions: Infinity display at a budget, but will it be a hit?. The Canvas Infinity’s camera isn’t its greatest strength, but it does a decent job. The Canvas Infinity has a 13-megapixel rear camera, which is fast to use, and the aperture is a f/2.0. In practice, my photographs came out looking bright and less blurry, even in low light conditions. More than the back camera, I liked the front-facing 16 MP “selfie” camera which offers quality good enough to upload to social media which is what most users want.. Micromax Canvas Infinity isn’t perfect, but it doesn’t disappoint either. What I really liked about the Canvas Infinity is that it doesn’t look inferior from a performance standpoint of view. The features that really standout from the rest of the crowd is its taller aspect ratio display and the cameras. That’s a pretty good proposition – after all, the phone only costs Rs 9,999.

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Smile detection, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR). Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor.

Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD.

Ketan Pratap , 02 September 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Micromax Canvas Infinity has been launched at Rs. The 18:9 screen is the biggest highlight of this device. Gadgets 360 rates the phone 6 out of 10. Micromax Canvas Infinity design Micromax Canvas Infinity specifications and software Micromax Canvas Infinity cameras Micromax Canvas Infinity performance Micromax Canvas Infinity battery life. A lot of smartphone companies are now designing phones with screens that occupy their entire front surfaces, and nearly no borders. This year's most premium smartphones, including the LG G6 , Samsung Galaxy S8 , Galaxy S8+ and Galaxy Note 8 , have all featured these taller screens. Different brands have their own buzzwords, such as LG calling its screens FullVision while Samsung uses the term Infinity Display, but they all promise more screen and less body. Thankfully, these screens are already being featured on phones at more affordable prices, such as the LG Q6 and the recently unveiled Micromax Canvas Infinity .. LG's Q6 has been priced competitively to take on other phones at the Rs. Micromax, on the other hand, has different aspirations, and has positioned its all-new Canvas Infinity in the sub-Rs. The company has already confirmed that there will be more models in the Canvas Infinity series.. The 18:9 screen is this phone's biggest talking point but is that enough to challenge the competition? At this price level, the Canvas Infinity will have to take on some popular models including the Xiaomi Redmi 4 , Nokia 5 , Moto G5 , and Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 , all of which offer better hardware. We find out in our review.. In terms of design, the 18:9 screen is the first thing you'll notice about the Canvas Infinity, and we did feel that this made the phone seem premium. It has rounded corners matching the exterior of the phone. However, we're confused by the official images shared by Micromax at launch time, which show a nearly bezel-less design. In reality, the phone has much thicker borders than seen in its promotional shots, and you'll notice the difference immediately. While the sides are narrow, the top and bottom are quite thick, much more than what we've seen on the premium Galaxy S8 ( Review ) and LG G6 ( Review ). Micromax claims that the 83 percent screen-to-body ratio is equivalent to that of the Galaxy S8 series.. Rather than having a metal unibody, the back of this phone pops off. It has a removable battery, and dedicated slots for dual Micro-SIMs and a microSD card which is much preferable to having a hybrid dual-SIM slots like most other phones in this category. Micromax has used top-notch plastic on the Canvas Infinity, because it really doesn't feel cheap, and a lot of people around us thought it was metal at first glance. We had no problem using the phone with just one hand, and it fits well within a palm thanks to its size and rounded corners. The narrower screen and relatively thin borders make this feel like a 5.5-inch phone when it actually has a 5.7-inch screen.. Like several other phones, there are lines running across the top and bottom of the rear. The power and volume buttons are on the right and are easily accessible with a thumb or forefinger. The Micro-USB port is on the bottom while the 3.5mm audio jack is on top. Much like other phones with 18:9 screens, the Canvas Infinity also uses on-screen navigation keys. The fingerprint scanner is on the back, right below the camera, and there's a Micromax logo towards the bottom. It was easy to reach even when using the phone with one hand.. Despite its size and shape, this screen is also a let-down. It has a resolution of 720x1440 pixels and is an IPS panel, but its quality isn't up to the mark. In our opinion, the display on the Canvas Infinity is the least accurate in terms of colours that we have seen in the budget segment for a long time. During the review period, we noticed yellow and bluish tinges when looking at it from the sides, which was annoying. Sunlight legibility was weak as well despite the brightness being pushed up to its maximum. Considering that Micromax plans to launch more phones in the Canvas Infinity series, we hope that the company uses better quality displays. Overall, the Micromax Canvas Infinity keeps its promise of delivering an 18:9 aspect ratio screen in the budget segment, but there are severe tradeoffs.. Inside the box, the company bundles the standard documentation, a transparent back cover, earphones, a charger, a Micro-USB cable, and the phone itself. The Canvas Infinity will be an Amazon India exclusive at launch time but will be made available offline later. Micromax sates that consumers can expect a straight replacement if it is unable to repair any problem with the phone.. The Micromax Canvas Infinity is powered by a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 SoC clocked at 1.4GHz, coupled with 3GB of RAM. This is the same processor that we've seen powering the entry-level Xiaomi Redmi 4A ( Review ). There's 32GB of storage which is expandable by up to 128GB using a microSD card. The phone also has a 2900mAh battery that is rated to offer talk time of 20 hours and standby time of 420 hours.. At the phone's launch event, Micromax heavily promoted the Canvas Infinity's cameras. This phone sports a 16-megapixel front camera with a soft flash, f/2.0 aperture and face beauty modes. The rear camera has a 13-megapixel sensor with an LED flash and f/2.0 aperture as well. Connectivity options include 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth, GPS, AGPS, and OTG support. There's an accelerometer and proximity, light and magnetic sensors as well.. The Canvas Infinity runs on Android 7.1.2 Nougat with the company's My Launcher on top. This is the most current iteration of Nougat in the budget smartphone market right now, and Micromax co-founder Rahul Sharma has confirmed that the Canvas Infinity will be upgraded to Android 8.0 Oreo soon. Unfortunately, my Launcher manages to bury almost all important Nougat features. There are no app shortcuts, quick toggles, or revamped notifications. Only some features, such as split-screen multitasking, direct replies and quick app switching are supported. The phone uses an icon pack that mimics iOS, and the Settings app is clearly inspired by it too. We prefer the custom UI of Micromax's own Yu Yureka Black , which we reviewed few months ago.. There is a plethora of bloatware including Apps Centre, Personalise, Videos, and Music, which cannot be deleted. Some of the third-party ones that can be uninstalled are the Narendra Modi , Amazon Shopping and Facebook. The Canvas Infinity is therefore a let-down in terms of software. Our recommendation would be to switch to the Pixel Launcher or use a third-party option like Nova Launcher or Yahoo Aviate.. The phone supports Smart Actions which let you do things like wake up or lock the phone by double tapping the screen, flipping it to mute calls and alarms, and automatically accepting calls when you lift the phone to your ear. There are also Smart Gestures which can help launch apps quickly. You use this feature by drawing an alphabet like "O" which launches the camera. We used the Smart Gesture feature and it worked flawlessly. Micromax has also added a one-handed mode which gets enabled when sliding left or right across the navigation bar.. The Micromax Canvas Infinity sports a 16-megapixel front-facing camera, which is being heavily promoted by the company. It has a soft flash, f/2.0 aperture, 5P lens, and comes with face beauty mode. The company is touting the camera's portrait mode which blurs the background similar to the bokeh effect that you can get on phones with dual cameras. Unfortunately, shots taken in portrait mode looked like they were had been Photoshopped with a heavy blur effect, and subjects seemed to have been auto-enhanced with unnatural colours. However, regular selfies were passable and showed good colours with decent amounts of detail in good light. In low-light, selfies were too dark without the soft flash.. There's also a 13-megapixel rear camera with an LED flash and f/2.0 aperture. It, too, supports portrait mode though it required some amount of adjustment to get the software to apply its enhancements. Shots taken with the Canvas Infinity came out with pleasant and natural colours under good light. We got some good macro shots, and landscapes were decent. However, we found that high-contrast scenes were often underexposed, which meant a loss of detail in the shadows.. Tap to see full-sized Micromax Canvas Infinity camera samples. When zooming in to 100 percent, the Micromax Canvas Infinity photo samples showed noise but were still passable for social media posts. Autofocus works accurately in good light though you will have to do it manually in low-light situations.. Unfortunately, the low-light performance of both cameras is below par. Both the front and rear cameras need some amount of direct light around to illuminate images or they end up looking too dark with heavy noise across the entire image and minimal details.. We liked the camera app on the Canvas Infinity, which had most options just one tap away. With the camera roll feature, you can take a look at the last photo you took without the need to close the main app. There's a feature called Super Pixel which takes multiple shots at the same time and combines them to give you a higher resolution and more detail. We noticed that images taken with Super Pixel were better than regular shots, though they looked a little artificial.. We have reviewed several phones with the Snapdragon 425 SoC, and they have all performed decently. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the Micromax Canvas Infinity which was sluggish right from the start. We encountered slow responses to our touch inputs which is something we don't expect from phones at this price anymore. We also faced app crashes on the Canvas Infinity which affected usability. We blame the My Launcher UI in part for the phone's sluggish performance. It's worth noting that the phone responded better when using a third-party launchers.. Thanks to the extended screen space, we found it easier to use GPS navigation and multitask with two apps simultaneously on the Canvas Infinity. No metal in the body meant that the phone didn't get too warm, which is a good thing. We used the phone extensively for watching videos and didn't feel it heating then either.. We can't recommend the Canvas Infinity for gaming enthusiasts, however, as the phone stutters while playing heavy games such as Marvel: Contest of Champions and Asphalt 8: Airborne. Lighter titles like Angry Birds, Temple Run 2, and Subway Surfers were playable without any issues.. The Micromax Canvas Infinity managed 36,753 in AnTuTu, 13fps in GFX Bench, 3,649 in 3D Mark Ice Storm Extreme, and 10,925 in Quadrant.. Calls were clear and the bundled earphones were relatively good. Unfortunately, the speaker wasn't loud or clear enough, and its placement at the back meant that you might not hear it at all if the phone is left on a soft surface. We were able to make VoLTE (voice over LTE) calls using a Jio SIM on the Canvas Infinity. The phone, however, doesn't support direct 4G video calling, a feature being offered by Reliance Jio. Both SIMs can work on 4G networks, though only one at a time.. The removable 2900mAh battery is claimed to deliver up to 420 hours of standby time and up to 20 hours of talk time. In reality, the phone did actually last for roughly 20 hours with heavy usage. During our review, we used the phone heavily for watching videos and streaming media, and the battery did well overall. In our standard HD video loop test, it lasted for 10 hours and 20 minutes, which is good enough for a battery of this size. There's no fast charging, and the Micromaxa Canvas Infinity took roughly two hours to charge fully.. 9,999, the Micromax Canvas Infinity tries to bring an 18:9 display to the budget market. While we have to commend Micromax for trying, this phone definitely falls short in many areas. Despite the display being this phone's highlight, it is also its biggest disappointment. The My Launcher skin is buggy and performance is sluggish. If you're in the market for a sub-Rs. 10,000 Android smartphone, you should look at other options such as the Xiaomi Redmi 4 ( Review ), Moto G5 ( Review ), Nokia 5, or Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 ( Review ), all of which have better hardware at around the same price. If you still want a smartphone with 18:9 display just because it's something new, then you should save up some money and go for the LG Q6 ( Review ) instead..
