There's not a big difference between M & N.. So i recently bought a used HTC Butterfly 3 (International version) for approx $115. This is the Taiwanese one (also known as HTC J Butterfly HTV31). For the price the specs & look of the phone are pretty awesome. Why is that htc butterfly3 video calling is too dark, i hardly see my face during night..

HTC's Butterfly 3 is more powerful than the One M9, but it's only available in Japan. The HTC Butterfly 3 (HTV31) is officially heading to Japan and will launch on au by KDDI. The flagship smartphone is essentially the Japanese response to the HTC One M9 and boy do we want one.. HTC's latest smartphone comes with a 20-MP duo-camera setup on the rear (with 4K recording), as well as a 13-MP selfie machine on the front. We're looking at BoomSound stereo speakers, 5.2-inch QHD display, Snapdragon 810 CPU, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage (with MicroSD expansion) and LTE. There's also the IR blaster and NFC for those who require extra connectivity. Everything is powered by the 2,700mAh battery.. Lastly, Android 5.0 Lollipop is onboard. The Butterfly 3 will be available in three colors: Indigo, Rosso and Silk. It's a stunning device and one we expect Japanese consumers will be pleased to see made available in their local market. Would you like to see the HTC Butterfly 3 (or an international version) made available in markets outside of Japan?. Source: HTC (Japanese), KDDI. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

The Butterfly 3 is HTC's high-end device with a polycarbonate body rather than metal as in the One series. It's also basically the international version of the Japan-only Butterfly J which was launched back in May. Specifications are impressive all around, with a 5.2-inch QHD LCD display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 chipset, and 3GB of RAM. On the software side of things HTC's Sense 7 runs on top of Android 5.0. There are 32GB of built-in storage and a microSD slot for expansion. Power is provided by a 2,700mAh battery and the body comes with an IP57 rating for dust and water protection.. In the Duo camera module a 20.2MP sensor is supported by a secondary distance sensor. Just like in the One M8 this allows for changing focus post-capture and simulation of a shallow depth-of-field effect. Light is captured through a lens with F2.2 aperture and an equivalent focal length of 27.8mm. The front element is made from sapphire glass for extra protection. There is a dual-LED flash for shooting in very low light and as you would expect from a device of this caliber the Butterfly 3 is capable of recording 4K video. The front camera features a 13MP BSI CMOS sensor and an F2.0 lens with an equivalent focal length of 28.2mm. It can record footage up to 1080p Full-HD resolution..

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ hands-on: The devil is in the details. HTC's Butterfly 3 makes you wonder why the M9 exists. Here's yet another case of "Japan gets all the nice things." Earlier today, local carrier au by KDDI announced its smartphone lineup for the summer, and the one that caught our attention was the new HTC J Butterfly (HTV31), which will no doubt be entering other markets as the Butterfly 3. With the centered 13-megapixel selfie camera and subtle front-side BoomSound stereo speakers, this new phone shares a similar face with the Desire Eye and the Desire 826 ; except its 5.2-inch screen has a much sharper Quad HD resolution. The familiar Duo Camera feature on the back (for bokeh plus filter effects) is here to stay, though for some bizarre reason, the secondary camera is placed below its 20.2-megapixel counterpart instead of above it, meaning you'll have to be more careful with where you place your index finger while holding the phone.. Gallery: HTC J Butterfly 3 (HTV31) hands-on | 17 Photos. As a flagship-level device, it's no surprise to see Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810 chip with 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, microSD expansion, IR blaster, NFC and LTE-Advanced radio (225 Mbps down, 25 Mbps up) here. With this in mind, the Butterfly 3 sits somewhere between the M9 and the M9+ -- same chipset as the former, same screen plus main camera as the latter; but all inside a waterproof (IP55 and IP57) plastic body. We don't mind the lack of fingerprint reader here, but we are a little baffled by the slightly smaller 2,700 mAh battery, as both the M9 and M9+ come with 2,840 mAh.. Other than that minor niggle, we're liking what HTC's offering here. Let's face it, the Butterfly 3 is much prettier than its predecessor and, in some ways, the M9 series; at least there isn't a sharp ridge running around the phone this time. Folks in Japan can grab one in early June, but if you'd rather have a fingerprint reader and don't mind missing out on the Duo Camera, then you may want to wait for the mysterious M9e.

Here is a list of all the Android Custom ROMs for HTC Butterfly 3 we hand picked for you. This is just a list of the ROMs available for your device, and increase the performance and add many customizations and features, and dump the old and the monotonous interface installed on the phone by the manufacturer, which we call as Stock ROM. Before you begin with the procedure to flash the ROMs on your phone, make sure that the phone has been properly charged, and the data backed up, as it might get fully wiped while installing it. Also you will need to root your phone first, and install a suitable custom recovery on it. So if you haven’t done that already, it is advised that you do so, before proceeding further. You need to flash them at your own risk as we would not be responsible for any things that happens thereafter.. This was a small list of the various custom roms available for HTC Butterfly 3, and if you have any doubt do contact us, and our team would try to fix it soon. If you have any other suggestion of a rom, which should have been included in the list, then do tip us and we would be glad to add it to our list of the roms for the HTC Butterfly 3..

This is HTC’s real flagship smartphone for 2015, and it’s a Japanese exclusive. HTC J Butterfly is a hybrid of the One M9 and One M9+, and it's amazing. HTC has big plans for 2015. So far we’ve tested the One M9 , tried out its virtual reality headset , and seen its first wearable device .. Since then, we’ve been hearing about yet another high-end smartphone, which is believed to be the Butterfly 3. Now the rumors have turned official, and the new J Butterfly has been announced in Japan.. Updated on 05-14-2015 by Andy Boxall: Added news of the J Butterfly HTV31’s launch in Japan, the official name for the J Butterfly 3.. Announced by Japanese network KDDI as part of its summer line-up of new smartphones, the J Butterfly HTV31 is the official version of what we’d previously thought would be named the Butterfly 3. An international launch is unlikely, based on previous Butterfly phones, which is a shame because it’s the most powerful HTC phone we’ve seen yet.. It’s a hybrid of the One M9 and the China-only One M9+. The screen is 5.2-inches and has a 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution, giving a massive 565ppi pixel density, and the phone runs Android 5.0 with HTC Sense 7. Power comes from a Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM, and there’s 32GB of internal storage memory.. A 20-megapixel camera sits on the back of the phone above the Duo sensor, plus there’s the same 13-megapixel selfie cam found on the Desire Eye above the screen round the front. The body is plastic rather than the all-metal construction of the One M9, and will be sold in several different colors, including white, blue, and red.. Running through the remainder of the spec sheet we find there’s a 2700mAh battery inside the J Butterfly, 4G LTE connectivity, NFC, forward-facing speakers with Dolby audio, and also — making it really stand out in this year’s flagship phone world — water and dust proofing.. If you’re wondering how to get your hands on the J Butterfly, it’s probably not going to be possible unless you live in Japan. There’s a chance HTC may slightly alter the phone and release it elsewhere under a different name, but don’t pin your hopes in it happening any time soon. According to KDDI, the J Butterfly HTV31 will be released in early June.. VISIT PAGE 2 FOR ALL THE RUMORS REGARDING THE J BUTTERFLY 3. HMD’s Nokia 8 Sirocco is another breath of fresh air that runs….
