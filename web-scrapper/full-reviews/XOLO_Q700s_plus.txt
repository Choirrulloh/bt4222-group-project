Specs include 4.5" display, 1.3 GHz quad core MediaTek processor, 1 GB RAM, 8 GB native storage, microSD slot for extra capacity, 8 MP rear camera and VGA front-facing shooter.

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Smile detection, Geo tagging, Voice activation. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 18.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 19.7 days (473 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 8.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 17.9 days (429 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. Data: HSDPA+ (4G) 21.1 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s, UMTS. Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Android v4.4.2 KitKat OS 3G Quad Core Processor 1GB RAM 4.5" 8MP Rear Camera 0.3MP Front Camera 1800mAH Battery 8GB Internal Memory. 1GB RAM Phones Full HD Phones 5000mAh Battery Phones Best Selling Phones. Smart phone manufacturers are plenty and the entry-level smart phone wars are on an all time high. Various Smart phone manufacturers (Global and Local) have come out with entry-level Android Kit Kat based smart phones and needless to say, the consumers are definitely spoilt for choice. One such vendor that has been involved in making much entry level and mid budget smart phones with quite reasonable price tags is Xolo. Off late, the vendor is completely set to launch two smart phones, the Q700s Plus and Q1000s Plus. Announced in September 2014, this phone is soon to hit the Indian market.. Let’s delve into the Q700 Plus and look at its specs:. The Q700 Plus comes loaded with a 1.3 GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6582M processor coupled with a 416 MHz clocked Mali-400 MP2 graphics unit and 1 GB of RAM. These aspects are pretty standard among most of the budget smart phones making it on par with the others in the segment. One advantage is that the device runs on an Android based KitKat Operating System (4.4.2). The device doesn’t have a Compass / Magnetometer, and Ambient Light sensor, a gyroscope, A barometer or a temperature sensor. But, it has an Accelerometer, but what’s interesting about this device is the features it has such as 3G, Wi-FI, Bluetooth, GPS and a Dual SIM card support. The Q700S Plus supports Java but the browser doesn’t feature flash. It has enough features to make competitors sweat both in terms of features and price.. The Xolo phone has a manageable display unit with a 4.5-inch IPS capacitive touch screen that has a FWVGA screen resolution of 854×480 pixels. The IPS panel will render good viewing angles and decent color reproduction. It does feel like using a low-resolution display enabled device, which seems eerie and a little disappointing. The On-Cell technology on the Xolo Q700S Plus provides a faster screen response. This combination of screen size and resolution renders an average pixel density of ~218 pixels per inch to the handset making it a moderate performer for its price tag. It cannot be termed as a sparkling star in the display department; it measures 136 x 64.60 x 8.90 mm that isn’t the best size but it accommodates itself well in the pocket. The device will be available in Black, Titanium Blue, Real Golden colors .. The Xolo Q 700 S Plus has an 1800 mAh powered battery that can deliver up to 429 hours of standby time with 8 hours of talk time, 4.7 hours of web browsing and 50 hours of music playback all under 3G. We’ve seen and experienced better batteries. But hey, this is a budget friendly phone with its own twist of power saving.. The Xolo Q700S Plus adds a plus advantage with its network and connectivity options. To start off, the phone connects to 2G networks with GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 bands with both Sim 1 and Sim 2 and a 3G Network with HSDPA 2100 band. As far as connectivity goes, the 700S plus can be connected to Wi-Fi (802.11 b/ g/ n), GPS, and Bluetooth. But, it doesn’t have an NFC connection, Infrared, DLNA, MHL Out or HDMI. The phone has a Micro-USB port that enables charging. The Dual Sim enabled device has GSM connectivity. Sim 1 connects to 3G whereas Sim 2 operates on 2G. The device connects to a 3.5 mm headphone jack as well as an FM radio, but lacks proprietary charging and data connector.. The device comes with 8GB of internal space that can be expanded up to 32GB with the help of a Micro SD card. The 700S Plus has a stunning 8 Mega Pixel Exmor rear camera with LED flash and Auto Focus, that is a rear feat in budget sensitive smart phones. The secondary camera however revives the sensation of using a budget phone; it has a VGA camera with 0.3 mega pixels. The camera performs quite well in low lighting conditions, another advantage is that the device supports FHD 1080 P video recording as well as panorama, live photo mode, HDR and voice capture. It also supports MP3 / WAV files with AAC + player as well as Mp4 / WMV / with H.364 and H.263 player.. First and foremost, it is very hard to find budget friendly smart phones with state of the art features. Xolo Q700S Plus has various plus points and supersedes niggles. The device has a very good operating system and decent specs; the primary camera is also a very good addition, it is a little sad to know that the phone doesn’t have a better resolution screen. Xolo has added the right sort of concoction to assemble this technology and user-friendly device. The Xolo Q700S Plus is hence a good device and it should do pretty well in India..
