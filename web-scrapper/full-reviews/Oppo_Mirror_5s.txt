Oppo Mirror 5s - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 ». i love its remote control features for televesions. I got this phone 2nd hand pretty cheap ($150aud retails here for $269) And I am blown away. I have always had ios and needed something new but really cant be F'ed paying apples prices ($1000Aud minimum) so I went with it as my iPhone 5 was dying. Screen is amazing - Viewing angles are perfect, Colour is great and brightness is just what you need. Some reviewers say its average but they would be comparing it to a top Samsung. If you're coming from a basic android or old iOS its 10/10. Its fast enough - I've only played Miitomo and it runs with out a hitch. Minor stutter from time to time with scroll and app switch. Battery CAN be great but that depends on what you do.. About the same as the iPhone 5. As minimal and usable as the Color OS (its actually not bad at all, nice and fast. Very smooth) is I will always want stock android. Its running 5.1 at least but there's no support for custom ROMS to run stock android. So google now offers a lot of there stock apps on the playstore plus a Marshmellow 6.0 launcher..It more or less looks and feels like Stock android and It does the job till I can get a R7s or Nexus 6P. Just buy it or the F1 ( I'm pretty sure that is replacing it) These are great phones and you no longer need to spend a fortune for a good device.. Bought a mirror 5s in Australia. BEST phone I have ever owned. Runs as quick as seamlessly as an iphone 5 I had (work phone), but with all the benefits of android! Battery life is insane. I get over 2 days, sometimes into 3. The colorOS is very minimal so that is also great. GPS accuracy is great (unlike my galaxy that was rubbish). So glad I took a gamble on the brand..

I've been using oppo since december 2014. and still i have it in good contion.. harman , 23 Sep 2015 Is the camera of oppo mirror 5s better than iPhone 5s...?? IPhone i s better when zooming and low light.in daylight have same clarity.battery of both same duration.price oppo cheaper but I use for 7 month and the problem start.if you want a quality that can last for 2-3 years buy iPhone don't buy oppo. Ethanjo, 25 Oct 2015 Hey I just buy this phone few days ago. I just notice that the battery life is to short, do I ... more I also bought this device and i am very happy with it. To get long battery life u can stop some apps on the backround or don't use too long you're internet or playing games because this phone only havea battery of 2450mAh. If i dont use my mobile only on standby so no calls only on standby i can use it for a week or 8 days. If use internet whatsapp or other apps i can make it a day..so it depent how u use it. it's a strong battery...good luck with it.. one sim for work and the other for private use.

Thing is they already had the Mirror 5, so named because the screen is 5 inches, therefore the iterative update is called the Mirror 5s. Are they not allowed to do this because of the existence of another phone with 5s in it's name?. I've had this fone for abt 2 weeks n everything is perfect it's so fast n smooth not to mention really good camera n sleek look awesome fone if ur not sure abt this fone I recommend u get it I think it's way better then a lot of way more expensive fones..

Mikethefool, 11 Nov 2015 I don't really understand if frame is in real metal or plastic that looks like metal. more It is plastic, the phone doesn't feel super cheap though.. In my opinion one of the best value for money for a phone. Got one and compared with Samsung galaxy S5 and this phone is similer or slightly better in camera quality and sound. Put it side by side with iphone 6 and you won't believe the price difference. A slight leg in touch sometimes but hardly notices unless you look for it.. I don't really understand if frame is in real metal or plastic that looks like metal. koala, 27 Sep 2015 yes!!!

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $140 Buy. $90 Buy.

Go and get yourself the Oppo Mirror 5S and you will immediately gain that status.. We had earlier reviewed the Oppo Mirror 5S , and we have to say that it looks gorgeously beautiful. The device that was launched today has all the makings of a great smartphone and is a strong contender at a price point that won’t break the bank ($269). will be sold throughout Dick Smith stores nationwide, as well as online at. Michael Tran, Marketing Director at OPPO Mobile Australia, said: “Our goal is to offer Aussies a range of devices that match their lifestyle and budget.. The Mirror 5s maintains the high-quality craftsmanship that OPPO lives by, but does so at a price-point that’s pleasing on the wallet.” This is very true indeed.. You really can’t help but admire the beauty of the Mirror 5S, thanks to its sleek exterior and inner strength. You will come to appreciate how it looks so good from any angle. Feast your eyes on its unique back exterior that was designed with individual cut-glass sections and that have different reflective tendencies. All this is crafted using a sophisticated ultraviolet embossing technique that provides a stunning look in a stylish, white finish.. The beauty is not only on the outside, but all the way to the inside. Beneath the attractive surface is an innovative internal structure reinforced with a bi-metallic frame with cross beams that gives it the exceptional strength and durability. That’s something we don’t normally see in other smartphones.. Featuring a 5-inch IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen that displays 720 x 1280 pixels or ~294 ppi pixel density, the images on the screen are going to look great as well. By having the IPS screen tech, it provides for a much wider viewing angle that can easily be shared with a friend or two.. Having such an impressive look, it may be hard to match on the inside. Equipped with a Qualcomm MSM8916 Snapdragon 410 chipset, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53, Adreno 306 and 2GB RAM; it somehow falls short of the expectation. However, it is still good enough for most daily tasks.. The Mirror 5S uses an 8 Megapixel primary camera that comes with f/2.2 aperture lens and 1.4 um pixels size. With greater photo-sensitivity for low light conditions and a faster exposure time that minimizes blurring. Combined with the newly enhanced Pure Image 2.0+ engine; you can look forward to consistently superior images, whether it is day or night.. Then it has the 5 Megapixel secondary camera that comes with Beautify 3.0 technology, which eliminates the need for image editing. You can now focus on capturing beautiful and natural selfies to share with friends and family. It also comes equipped with multiple modes, matching gender, age, and so much more. You will have so much fun exploring what the camera can do. With the simple press of a button, the smartphone will automatically take six snaps, then create and combine them into a 24-megapixel photo, perfect for high-quality prints. Double Exposure and Time-lapse also serve as creative features from OPPO, with other modes including Super GIF, Panorama, Colorful Night Shot, plus many more.. You can expect the Mirror 5S to be faster, steadier and better as it has fast activation speed, smooth and steady sliding when ColorOS 2.1 meets Android 5.1 together. The new OS provides a faster, steadier, and overall enhanced user experience. Besides the new UI and extended themes available, ColorOS also offers fast activation speeds, smooth and steady sliding, as well as more memory and power, in which key application scenes have been optimized.

Home Reviews Smartphones & Mobile Devices OPPO Mirror 5s – 'blinged out' budget smartphone (review). Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. OPPO Mirror 5s – 'blinged out' budget smartphone (review). OPPO has released the Mirror 5s – the second new model in as many months. It is aimed squarely at the mass market and offers value well above the price.. Flagship phones – Apple iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy S6, LG’s G, Sony Xperia Z3/4, HTC One M9, Lenovo Moto X, and Microsoft 930 series (superseded). Huawei, OPPO, Xiaomi, ZTE and others have entrants in this category. Mid to high range – Huawei P8/Max, OPPO R7/Plus, Xiaomi, ZTE, Samsung A, LG L&F series, Moto E/G, Lumia 6XX. This may include Note/Phablets with Pen support. Mass market – Huawei Ascend Y/G series, OPPO 5s and N, ZTE. OPPO may be a little oppo-tunistic with naming this device. I honestly expected it to have an innovative mirrored front glass suitable for quick glances to see if makeup was on and hair straight – alas, it refers to the diamond pattern cut in the gloss white back. “Designed with individual cut-glass sections and different reflective tendencies, all crafted using a sophisticated ultraviolet embossing technique.”. So, to me it is just the 5s and it looks a little Applesque too.. Now let’s start on the price – A$269 from your local Dick Smith store (or its MOVE or David Jones Electronics) it is at almost the lowest price point of the mass-market price bracket that stretches from about $250-500.. For that, you cannot possibly get top-draw specs but this certainly competes with mass-market phones nearly twice its price and puts a good many mid-market ones to shame. Its good value from a Chinese manufacturer that has offices and support in Australia – it is a safe buy.. iTWire has adopted a new paradigm for smart phone reviews to ensure that like is compared to like – apples with apples - and not with specifications clearly out of its class.. The second column (greyed out) represents the typical specification for this class and the next what the OPPO 5s offers. Where it punches above its weight it will receive a + score.. Hardened – likely Gorilla 3 as has glove touch support. Qualcomm MSM8916 401 quad-core 1.2 GHz. LTE 1, 3, 5, 7, 8 28, 40. Yes – takes Micro and Nano sim but to use dual sim feature you lose microSD storage. Connects to two different carriers – supports dual 4G. Wi-Fi N, single band, WiDI, Wi-Fi Display. G-Sensor E-Compass Light Sensor Distance Sensor IR remote – for TV control. 8MP, f/2.2, Single flash, 3264x2448 pixels, autofocus, 1.4um,. 1080p video record at 60 fps. Normal, Ultra HD, colourful night, Beautify, 11 colourful filters, Panorama, HDR, GIF, Slow shutter, Audio photo, Double exposure, Expert mode, Time-lapse. Screen to body ratio (higher better as it affects dimensions) or keyboard. Premium gloss white finish above what is expected for the price/class. It the UI and apps covering for adware. ColourOS 2.1 for Android is light and unobtrusive.. USB Host OTG (supports USB Flash drives). Like its bigger brother – the spectacularly priced and featured R7 at $449 – this punches way above its weight. Build quality is excellent – including a bi-metal chassis. Android 5.1 works well on this device.. The camera took good photos – no it is not 13, 16, 20 MP as you will find in mid to flagship phones but it took competent shots in day and night – certainly commensurate with any other 8MP camera (iPhone 6 is only 8MP) and it has a new Pure Image 2.0+ engine that seems to deliver great results in mosts conditions even with flash. It has time-lapse and a double exposure mode that allows pictures to overlay and create different visual effects.. The front selfie has Beautify 3.0 – like taking a shot with Vaseline smeared on it to give a flattering result.. Chinese reviews are calling it a ‘blinged-out’ budget smartphone and that is what it is – good looks and beginning to get enough street cred in Australia – fewer are asking ‘what the hell’ an OPPO is.. Its proof that Android may be Android but you do not have to spend two, three, four times the price to get the features this has. OPPO R7 as Australia’s undisputed best mid and mass market phones that offer so much more.. LEARN HOW TO BE A SUCCESSFUL MVNO.

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Quad-core, 1200 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

Jul 03 AT 2:56 PM. Dima Aryeh is a Russian obsessed with all things car and tech. His time is split between gaming and fixing his racecar. He also does photography in his spare time. Tagged # announcement # mid-range # oppo # Oppo Mirror 5s # release # Snapdragon 410. Oppo’s high-end devices are pretty awesome, but the latest unveiled device is actually more mid-range. The Oppo MIrror 5s was unveiled in Taiwan and features some decent specs and a nicely designed rear plate. And surprisingly, it runs on the latest version of Android!. The Mirror 5s features a 5-inch 1280×720 display, a Snapdragon 410 processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of memory, an 8MP rear camera, a 5MP front camera, and a 2420 mAh battery. It is also dual SIM and supports LTE connectivity, which makes it great for the mid-range market. And running the show is ColorOS 2.1, which is skinned Android 5.1 Lollipop.. The back is something that should be mentioned, as it’s designed pretty nicely. It has a nice crystal pattern surrounded by a metal frame. There’s no word on price or availability, so we may never get it here in the US. But for the markets Oppo serves, this should be a nice device when it launches. Hopefully the price won’t be too high.. - Any - 3G|4G U301 USB Modem Acer Aspire One Netbook Acer Liquid M220 Airave 2.5 Plus Alcatel 510A Alcatel 768 Alcatel 871A GoPhone Alcatel A392G Alcatel Fling
