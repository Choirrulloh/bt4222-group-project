Good device at the price point just not worth it with good competition around same price point.. The A7000 Turbo is a pretty odd device with the launch of K4 note it serves no real puprose at less than Rs.1000 Price differece.. k3 note with 1GB more ram and 100 mAh lesser battery.. Uninspiring design nothing new nearly identical to K3 note slim nothing special finctional design with old era design capacitive buttons.. Since it shares the same hard that goes to the camera hardware too, its good shooter for its budget but nothing to brag about in good lighting conditions it will take accetable pics specially consider the budget.. Full HD OGS IPS LCD ensure that it has a great display and one of the better one's in this price range and Lenovo has done a great job keeping it up.. a 1.7 Ghz Mediatek MT6752 Octa Core processor. Same processor powering the k3 Note and bunch of other mid range devices,. One draw back and common complaint has been the processor isn't adept at handling full HD screen and has had quite a few heating complaints nothing too drastic but the phone would have been a better over all performer with a HD screen instead of Full HD like the Moto G 3rd Generation .. 2900 mAh battery powering the device should ensure a days usage easily for most users without much or any need to be tehthered to the wall in search of chargers midday.. Not sure what the device is suppose to do with the launch of k4 note which is better in every aspect with less than Rs.1000 price difference.

Information about the process technology used in manufacturing the chip. The value in nanometers represents half the distance between elements that make up the CPU.. CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors. They increase the performance of the device allowing the execution of multiple instructions in parallel.. The frequency of the processor describes its clock rate in cycles per second. It is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. GPU is a graphical processing unit, which handles computation for 2D/3D graphics applications. In mobile devices GPU is usually utilized by games, UI, video playback, etc. GPU can also perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the CPU.. Similar to the CPU, the GPU consists of processing units called cores. They handle the computation of graphics in various applications.. The frequency is the clock rate of the graphic processor (GPU), which is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. RAM (Random-Access Memory) is used by the operating system and all installed applications. Data in the RAM is lost after the device is turned off or restarted.. Information about the type of RAM used by the device.. Information about the number of RAM channels integrated in the SoC. More channels mean higher data transfer rates.. RAM frequency relates directly to the rate of reading/writing from/in the RAM memory.. Information about the capacity of the built-in storage of the device. Sometimes one and the same model may is offered in variants with different internal storage capacity.. The various types of memory cards are characterized by different sizes and capacity. Information about the supported types of memory cards.. One of the main characteristics of the display is its type/technology, on which depends its performance.. In mobile devices display size is represented by the length of its diagonal measured in inches.. The ratio between the long and the short side of the display. The display resolution shows the number of pixels on the horizontal and vertical side of the screen. The higher the resolution is, the greater the detail of the displayed content.. Information about the number of pixels per centimeter (ppcm) or per inch (ppi) of the display. The higher the pixel density, the more detailed and clearer is the information displayed on the screen.. The color depth of the display is also known as bit depth. It shows the number of bits used for the color components of one pixel.

Lenovo A7000 Turbo Price, Specifications and Review. Lenovo has re-branded K3 Note as a Lenovo A7000 Turbo, primarily for offline markets. In online retail space, Lenovo K4 Note selling in the adjacent price range makes more sense as of today. The Lenovo A7000 Turbo, however, will also be available online from Lenovo's own Thedostore and via other sellers on online retail sites. Needless to say, specifications are same as K3 Note, which was also Lenovo's best selling smartphone in 2015. There is 5.5-inch full HD display, 1.7GHz MediaTek MT6752 quad core chipset, 2GB RAM and 16GB expandable storage. There is a 13MP rear camera and a 5MP selfie camera for photography needs. The Lenovo K3 Note today stands as a well tested device. The handset was capable of delivering good user experience for the price but had a few shortcomings. The loudspeaker wasn't loud enough, the display glass was a bit reflective, processor didn't handle high end gaming very smoothly and camera performance seems to dwindle in tricky conditions. The best part was its vivid full HD display panel. We hope the same pros and cons will be passed on to the A7000 Turbo as well. The Lenovo A7000 Turbo price in India is 10,999 INR which is 1000 INR more than that of K3 Note. After a few days, you will also be able to buy Lenovo A7000 Turbo Online from third party sellers on ebay and other websites.
