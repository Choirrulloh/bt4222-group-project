I was used Panasonic eluga pulse X mobile phone,even it had 3 GB ram it will lag in high graphics games, but there is no problem like that. Also it has dedicated slots better than the classy hybrid.

Ketan Pratap , 10 August 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Lenovo's K8 Note is an Amazon India exclusive. The phone fares well in terms of overall performance. Gadgets 360 rates the phone 8 out of 10. There has been a sudden increase in the number of powerfully-specced smartphones in the sub-Rs. 20,000 market, and the new Lenovo K8 Note is the latest to join them. The new Lenovo device is targeted at buyers who love entertainment on the go and don't want to compromise with performance or camera quality. The Lenovo K8 Note sports dual cameras at the back, a feature that has become very popular among Android manufacturers after the launch iPhone 7 Plus ( Review ) last year. There are already quite a few Android smartphones with dual cameras in the Indian market including the Coolpad Cool 1 Dual ( Review ), OnePlus 5 ( Review ), and Honor 6X ( Review ). We'll find out how well K8 Note fares against its competitors.. Ever since completing its acquisition of the Moto brand, Lenovo has been on a roll in terms of smartphone shipments. Industry reports show that Lenovo has managed to become one of the top five smartphone vendors in India thanks to its vast portfolio of products. At the India launch of the K8 Note, Lenovo claimed that it has managed to sell 8.5 million K-series devices in the country so far.. With the Lenovo K8 Note, the company is also switching to a stock Android experience, ditching the Vibe Pure UI entirely , which is big move. On paper, the Lenovo K8 Note has some decent specs and features, but competition is stiff. Does it manage to strike a good balance between pricing and features? We find out.. Lenovo K8 Note look and feel The Lenovo K8 Note's metal body feels sturdy when you hold the phone for the first time. The Aluminium 6000 material offers a premium feel and a soft touch. While there's no doubt that the K8 Note is one of the better looking phones in its category, the design is far from original, and strongly reminds us of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. It has 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass spread across the front edges, which looks neat. Lenovo has used an anti-fingerprint coating on the screen which means you shouldn't have to bother cleaning it very often.. The Lenovo K8 Note has capacitive navigation buttons at the front, which aren't backlit. We often had trouble using them in the dark. The front camera has its own LED flash which has been a popular demand lately, according to Lenovo. The rear has the dual cameras which are placed one above the other, accompanied by a dual LED flash. The fingerprint sensor is right below the cameras, and was easily accessible at any point. The overall size and placement of physical buttons makes them easy to use. We liked the fact that power and volume buttons have been slightly low to easily fall under a thumb or forefinger depending on which hand you're holding the phone in.. There are the familiar antenna bands on the top and bottom of the handset's rear. The bands will match the phone's colour, making them blend in. The Lenovo K8 Note will be available in Fine Gold and Venom Black, which we received for our review. Lenovo has gone with minimalistic branding on the K8 Note, which is good. You can find a logo at the back.. The left panel has a dedicated "Music key" which is customisable for any purpose. Users can customise it via Settings > Music Key for playing/ pausing audio or video, toggling the flashlight, launching the camera, taking a screenshot, or opening a specific app. The Music Key has a red colour accent to make it stand out, with play and pause icons above it. There are also dedicated slots for two SIMs and a microSD card, which Lenovo stressed is one of the most demanded features in this segment. There's a Micro-USB port at the bottom, with a speaker grille on either side. Unfortunately, there's only one functional speaker, but this phone does support Dolby Atmos Audio enhancement. The other grille is just for show, much like on many other budget phones. The top has a 3.5mm audio jack.. We had no trouble using the K8 Note with just one hand. It measures 154.5x75.9x8.5mm and its rounded edges make it fit well in a palm. At 180g, this phone is a bit heavy compared to the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (175 grams) which should be seen as direct competition. Additionally, the Lenovo K8 Note has a water repellent design which help it survive light splashes, but don't consider it to be equivalent to actual water resistance. Lenovo clearly points out that liquid damage will not be covered under the warranty.. When compared to the Lenovo K6 Note , the Lenovo K8 Note has a lot of improvements in terms of design that make it feel more premium for its price. In the box, you get a transparent plastic case, a USB cable, a 15W rapid charger, a SIM ejector, and instruction manuals. The Lenovo K8 Note is the company's first smartphone to ship with a rapid charger. However, there are now no bundled earphones which might be a bit of disappointment for some buyers.. Lenovo K8 Note specifications and software The Lenovo K8 Note features a 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) display. Under the hood, it is powered by a deca-core MediaTek Helio X23 (MT6797) SoC with four cores clocked at 1.4GHz, another four cores at 1.85GHz, and two cores at 2.3GHz. The K8 Note has been launched in India in two storage and RAM variants: 3GB of RAM with 32GB of storage, and 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage. We received the latter for our review. Storage expansion using a microSD card (up to 128GB) is supported.. Lenovo is heavily marketing the dual camera feature on the K8 Note, which is the company's first phone to offer this feature. There's a 13-megapixel primary sensor and a 5-megapixel depth sensor for creating a bokeh effect. For selfie lovers, the K8 Note has a 13-megapixel sensor at the front with its own LED flash. There's a 4000mAh non-removable battery, and this phone does support rapid charging. The K8 Note features 4G with VoLTE (voice over LTE). LTE Cat 6 speed means that you can get up to 300Mbps download speeds and up to 50Mbps upload speeds if your carrier offers that kind of performance. Other connectivity features include Wi-Fi 802.11 ac and Bluetooth 4.1.. One of the big changes Lenovo is making with its all-new K8 Note is in terms of software. The Chinese company shared the news first with Gadgets 360 , and confirmed that all future Lenovo phones will run stock Android out-of-the-box. The Lenovo K8 Note runs on the recent Android 7.1.1 Nougat. This means Lenovo has entirely ditched its Vibe Pure UI. Running Android 7.1.1, the Lenovo K8 Note comes has the 3D Touch-like app shortcuts feature , which was rolled out in December last year. K8 Note users can perform contextual actions using any optimised app by simply long-pressing its icon. Our unit had already received the latest July security patch, and Lenovo promises that users can expect timely updates from now on. Some of the other notable Android 7.1.1 features on the K8 Note include GIF support directly in the keyboard, a wide variety of new emojis, split-screen multitasking, and Google Assistant.. You get all the standard Google apps including Duo, Play Movies and Play Music but the phone also comes with Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, which are removable. The interface is fluid, and you won't feel the device stuttering even when many apps are running. Google's Photos app becomes the default gallery which in our opinion is good, since you can sync all your photos and videos to the cloud.. There are still some minor tweaks to the software. You can find the Dolby Atmos app preloaded on the handset for tweaking audio settings. There's also TheaterMax VR support which was initially introduced with the Lenovo Vibe K4 Note. This time around, however, Lenovo doesn't have an exclusive partnership with any headset maker. The company feels that there are enough VR headsets in the Indian market, and the Lenovo K8 Note with TheaterMax tech will support most of them.. We tried the TheaterMax mode on the K8 Note with a VR headset in our lab, and found that it worked flawlessly. The VR mode can be enabled by long-pressing the power button and tapping the TheaterMax option. This lets you enjoy media on a virtual large screen, with a 100-degree field of view. We had fun watching videos and TV shows using the K8 Note and a headset as it offered a cinema-like feel. We hope that Lenovo partners with content providers and does even more with its VR push.. Interestingly, Lenovo has already promised that the K8 Note will be receiving an update to Android O before end of this year which makes it an even sweeter deal at this price.. Lenovo K8 Note performance and camera We had a good time using the Lenovo K8 Note, and found that stock Android was very welcome. We didn't have any issues despite running up to 12 apps in the background, which can be credited to Android's memory management. The K8 Note is being launched in 3GB and 4GB RAM options, and our suggestion would be to go with the 4GB version for a better overall experience if you can.. The only thing we noticed was that this phone got warm very quickly. You will start feeling heat if the camera app has been open for a few minutes or if you use GPS navigation even briefly. The same thing happened when gaming. A 20-minute session made the phone warm though not too uncomfortable to use.. Gaming on the Lenovo K8 Note was smooth, and it was able to handle heavy graphics in Need for Speed: No Limits without any hassle. Call quality was also decent, and we were able to make calls over the Jio network thanks to VoLTE support. The phone also does a good job of holding on to its signal in congested locations. The single speaker at the bottom right is loud enough but don't expect it to match the performance of stereo speakers. The Dolby Atmos app can be used to tweak audio options but still has its limits. Considering that Lenovo is heavily marketing the K8 Note as a multimedia device, we wish the company had gone with stereo speakers. There's no headset in the box which means that you will have to use your own.. As expected, the deca-core processor resulted in some pretty high test scores. AnTuTu returned 86,340 while Quadrant came up with 54,014, both of which are more than what we have seen on any phones we have reviewed in this price range. The K8 Note also managed 33fps in GFXBench and 11,151 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme. The 5.5-inch screen has a resolution of 1080x1920 pixels, and is adequately crisp and bright. Viewing angles are fine and sunlight legibility is not an issue. The display on the Lenovo K8 Note, in our opinion, was the best we have seen on a Lenovo device at this price level. We had a good time watching videos and playing games on the K8 Note.. Compared to the K6 Note ( Review ), the K8 Note has received a major bump in the camera department. It sports a 13-megapixel Purecel sensor and a 5-megapixel Samsung BSI sensor at the back. While the main 13-megapixel sensor is used to capture images, the 5-megapixel one captures depth of field information. The Camera app on the K8 Note is pretty stock which means you won't get a lot of tweaking options. Users can take images either in Normal mode or in Depth-enabled mode for a bokeh effect. Images taken in normal mode have good details and natural colours with low noise. The camera is quick to lock focus on a subject, and landscapes and macros are decent too. In our opinion, a lot more detail was visible in outdoor shots compared to most smartphone cameras in this category.. Tap to see full-sized Lenovo K8 Note camera samples. Coming to the depth-enabled shots, we found that the K8 Note handled this well but achieving a natural bokeh effect did take some effort. There will be times where you can get it right without making several attempts, but most often, you will get blurred-out shots the first time. You need to set the aperture value between f/1.2 to f/2.8 to blur out the background. We felt that the K8 Note camera was a bit harsh, and we ended up with some shots with unnatural-looking edges. Sometimes the subject wasn't adequately separated from the background and was partially blurred itself. We hope that this is something Lenovo can improve with software updates especially considering that the Lenovo K8 Note is the company's first smartphone with dual cameras.. Low-light shots tended to have a lot of noise especially when there was very little light around. We tried using the camera for landscape shots at night and ended up with results that looked washed out. Some indoor samples had visible color shading with poor detail.. The 13-megapixel front camera does a good job with selfies and the LED flash adds to its usefulness. There is a beauty mode to tweak shots slightly. The front camera was able to capture colour tones and details well enough compared to the competition in the segment.. Lenovo K8 Note battery life The 4000mAh battery in the K8 Note lasted for roughly for 20 hours with heavy usage. During our review period, we had WhatsApp, Outlook, Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, Google Maps, Telegram, and Twitter running at the background the entire time. We used the dual cameras extensively and also played games a lot. With lighter usage, our unit easily lasted over a day before switching to battery saving mode. However, the K8 Note still falls short of what the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 delivers in terms of battery performance.. In our standard video loop test, the K8 Note lasted for 14 hours and 20 minutes, which is good enough for a battery of this size. The Lenovo K8 Note ships with a rapid charger which means you can top it up quickly. We found that a mere 20-minute charge took us up to roughly 40 percent which should be enough juice to last for few hours. If you need a full charge, it will take nearly two hours.. Verdict The Lenovo K8 Note starts at Rs. 12,999 for the 3GB RAM /32GB storage model while our unit with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage has been priced at Rs. At these prices, the Lenovo K8 Note is a great overall package, and brings a lot to the table including stock Android, dual cameras, TheaterMax, and solid build quality. That said, there are few negatives. Battery life isn't the best in the segment, and the heating issue may concern you. The low-light camera results leave a lot to be desired as well. Thankfully, the highly marketed dual camera feature works well.. For Lenovo fans, the Lenovo K8 Note is a big upgrade from its predecessor, the Lenovo K6 Note, and is definitely worth the money. We can expect the K8 Note to go head-to-head with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 ( Review ) which has been very popular in this price range. However, with Xiaomi teasing a new dual-camera smartphone launching soon , we can expect to have fresh competition..

Lenovo K8, K8 Plus, and K8 Note will get Oreo update… next summer. by Mitja Rutnik October 18, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. If you own the Lenovo K8, K8 Plus , or K8 Note , we have some good as well as bad news. The good news is Lenovo has revealed on its website that all three devices will get updated to Android Oreo. This means they’ll receive all the latest features including picture-in-picture (PiP) mode, the ability to snooze notifications, and more.. The bad news, however, is that you’ll have to wait for quite some time before the update hits your device. The Lenovo K8 is expected to get it in June next year, while the other two models should be updated to the latest version of the OS a month later.. So the best case scenario is that the Oreo update will be released around eight months from now if everything goes to plan. This is rather strange when considering that all three handsets run a near-stock version of Android. What this means is that the update should be relatively easy to prepare, as it doesn’t really contain a lot of custom features developed by Lenovo.. One of the major advantages of devices with stock Android on board is that they are normally one of the first to get updated to the latest versions of the OS. That’s one of the reasons why smartphones made by Google (Nexus and. Pixel series) have been popular among consumers so far.. For now, the K8, K8 Plus, and K8 Note are the only Lenovo devices confirmed to get updated to Oreo, although more might join the list eventually.. Lenovo , Lenovo K8 Note.

Tech Blog with a focus on personal and consumer technology. The best place for meaningful tech news, analysis, views and reviews.. Lenovo K8 Note Review: A Killer, in Price and in Deed. Riding High on Stock Android, Dual Cameras. All day battery, Dolby Atmos and TheaterMax. After launching the K6 Note, last year in December, Lenovo has launched added another Note to the family, the Lenovo K8 Note. The Lenovo K Note series has been highly popular in the budget segment, and so powerful is its latest addition, which Lenovo claims it decided to give the K7 Note a miss (no, no superstition here, folks), and directly jumped to the K8 Note.. The K3 Note was the first full HD smartphone in India under Rs. 10,000 from a known brand and its successors took its legacy forward with features like TheaterMax technology, Dolby Atmos audio, and so on. Clearly, the K8 Note has a tough task. Not only does it have to live up to the K Note legacy, but it also has to justify skipping a generation. The Lenovo K8 Note does not look extraordinary. We received the black color variant (with 4GB RAM and 64GB ROM) for our review, and we would say that the company has played it safe in design terms, which is why, although solidly built, the phone does not exactly stand out in the smartphone market in the looks department.. The front of the phone is all about the 5.5-inch full HD display with a 2.5D curved glass which is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The display is bright and colorful and definitely is one of the best we have seen in this price segment, even though it does have rather prominent bezels (we have no problems with that, though). Right below it are three capacitive buttons on the chin of the smartphone for navigation, while the front camera, the earpiece, the physical LED flash and proximity sensor are all placed just above the screen. The phone is totally black from the front which we really like – only the capacitive buttons are slightly dark gray in color, making them stand out. Incidentally, the buttons are not backlit, sadly, which is why we think highlighting them was a good move.. As you will turn the phone around, you will get a metal-hit. The K8 Note comes with a metal unibody with slightly shiny antenna bands placed on the top and the base of the back. Just below the first antenna band comes the feature that will distinguish it from other phones in the market – a unit of primary dual cameras alongside which there is a dual LED flash. The camera unit juts out of the back but did not pick up any scratches in our use. Just below the camera(s), there is a circular fingerprint sensor which works just fine and is fast and accurate enough. Above the second antenna band that is placed near the base, there is a very subtle Lenovo branding. Lenovo, unlike some brands, does not seem desperate to get attention. To be honest, dual cameras apart, the Lenovo K8 Note reminds us a lot of the Redmi Note 4 from the back. The slightly shiny antenna bands, matte back and the placement of the camera and fingerprint sensor, all reminded us of the Redmi Note 4, which is not at all a bad thing because the Note 4 is beautiful (especially the black model…oops, we did it again).. The top of the phone sports the 3.5 mm audio jack, and the base of the phone comes with Micro USB port (Nah, no USB Type-C) and speaker grilles. The left side of the K8 Note holds the dual SIM card (nano) tray and the dedicated microSD card tray – which means you will not have to give up one of the networks on your phone to add additional storage to your smartphone. Hooray, no hybrid SIM slot hassles. The left side also sports the dedicated Music key accented with red (a very small drop of color on the completely black phone, which adds a twist in taste to a traditional recipe). If you are not really THAT big a fan of music, you can also customize this button and use it to perform various functions like launching your favorite app, starting the camera, or simply turning on the flashlight. The right side comes with the volume rocker and a textured power/lock button. The smartphone measures 154.5 x 75.9 x 8.5 mm and weighs 180 grams. It feels a little heavy to hold but can otherwise easily fit in one hand and seems rock solid and slim enough.. The Lenovo K8 Note is powered by a MediaTek Helio X23 2.3 GHz deca-core processor coupled with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 128 GB via microSD card. It ran up a decent score on the AnTuTu benchmark, 82951, which is significantly more than what its competitors have scored. And it is no paper tiger in the specs department – the smartphone sailed through multitasking hurdles that we put in front of it. We switched one app from another, and the phone did not lag or slow down. We jumped from social media apps to games to messaging apps, and the phone did not disappoint us.. The phone also did well in the casual gaming territory – we played games like Subway Surfer, Colour Switch, Temple Run on the smartphone and it worked smoothly. But the real surprise came with its performance in the high-end gaming zone either. While playing games like NFS – No Limits and Asphalt Xtreme, while we did face the odd lag or frame drop, the gaming experience itself was very smooth indeed. Taking into consideration the price of the K8 Note and its specifications, we think the phone is a very creditable performer even in the high-end gaming zone. Yes, it heats up slightly when working through the high-end games but this never seemed to be alarming.. Everyone has been talking about dual cameras for a while and now Lenovo as well. With the introduction K8 Note, the Lenovo has a entered in the field of dual rear cameras. The K8 Note comes with a combination of two sensors on its back. One is the primary sensor of 13-megapixel, and the other is a 5-megapixel sensor which is present to analyze the depth of field and introduce bokeh (read “blurry background”) in the picture. This is similar to the one we saw on the Honor 6X in concept. Now that we are done with the basic preamble, let us get straight to the point. There are two basic modes in the camera app of the Lenovo K8 Note.. In the Normal mode, the camera module on the Lenovo K8 Note is hands down one of the best we have seen in this segment, in terms of color reproduction and detailing. The rear cameras produce colors that are very close to the reality. The colors in the pictures were not fading or saturating at any point and were very realistic. The camera pretty much knocks it straight out of the park in terms of detail as well. We took close ups, landscapes, portraits, indoor, and outdoor shots and the detailing was on point in most cases and zooming into the picture did not result in pixelation for quite a while. In some close ups, we could even see the reflection of the surroundings in water droplets – it was that good. Another bonus point was the camera’s low light performance. We were stunned to see how well it did even in low light environments. It even handled glare well, and no light seemed to be bleeding out of the boundaries when we pointed it at lamps or light sources. And what’s more, it is super consistent.. That said, the bokeh bit of the story, which is supposed to be THE USP of the device, is a different tale altogether. Once you switch to depth-enabled mode, you get three options to choose the aperture of the camera lens, which determines the level of bokeh that will be introduced in your pictures. The options are f/2.8, f/1.8 and f/1.2 where f/2.8 offers the shallowest bokeh while f/1.2 offers the deepest (most blurry background in simple English). We preferred the shallowest bokeh amongst the three options as it had minimum chances of things going wrong. We thought the bokeh produced by the Lenovo K8 Note was very inconsistent and more software oriented than hardware generated, notwithstanding the second camera. The bokeh worked in some cases and failed in some. We witnessed the pictures getting bokeh unevenly, and this did not blur out when we increased the bokeh level, and only got more highlighted (pun intended).. Ironically, while the camera was consistent in normal mode, here consistency pretty much went out of the window – often blurring out some part of the picture as well as the subject. Yes, it was great when it worked, but alas, this did not happen all the time. The pictures taken in Depth-enabled mode can be later edited with a separate Depth Editor which comes with the Photos app. It allows you to make a selected part of the picture black and white, you can edit the bokeh-ed area and can even change the background of an image. It is no high-end editor but works just fine in most cases.. The Lenovo K8 Note comes with a 13-megapixel front shooter with LED flash placed on the front. The performance of the front camera can be a little inconsistent. In some cases, the pictures turned to be exceptionally well detailed with well-reproduced colors, while in other cases the colors seemed a little faded and the details were pretty much out of the picture (quite literally). The flash on the front works fine but can be a little too harsh at times. The selfie also offers HDR mode and beauty mode. The former makes pictures better, and the latter just makes the subject looks like an anime. All in all, we love the cameras on the Lenovo K8 Note, notwithstanding the slightly slow image processing speed and the frequent exhortations to hold the phone still. The camera app itself comes with minimalistic options (why? Read on). There are options like HDR mode, flash, timer and an icon to switch from Normal mode to Depth-enabled mode on top of the screen while on the base, there is the option to switch cameras, the shutter button, and the four modes namely, Panorama, Professional mode, video and the camera one.. Lenovo’s sister brand, Moto, has been known for the smartphones with stock Android while Lenovo introduced phones with Android and its in-house Vibe UI. But it looks like Lenovo is now following Moto down the stock Android route. The K8 Note is the first phone from Lenovo that comes with stock Android Nougat 7.1.1. And as per Lenovo, the phone will receive regular (faster) updates, too.. This makes the phone UI pretty basic – as well as customizable – as removing the in-house UI layer has taken away all the Vibe UIs features that most of the Lenovo devices came packed with. The move which is seen as a positive one largely because it unclutters the UI makes the device faster and also reduces bloatware has its negative side as well. We missed some of the extra toppings, and the phone felt more like Moto than Lenovo. But it basically all boils down to what you like. Stock Android is the darling of many Android fanboys, but we think some other users might find it well, too plain (Hey, there was not even Lenovo’s own Shareit on the phone out of the box). But this doesn’t mean that Lenovo has given up all the software tricks that it has up its sleeves – the camera app has a depth editor mode as well as depth enabled mode, and remember the customizable Music key we mentioned in the beginning? Essentially, Lenovo has tried to strike a balance between stock Android and additional features, giving stock Android priority. And hey, you can also say, “Ok Google” and get virtual assistance. To be fair, with stock Android, the K8 Note does work very smoothly indeed.. The Lenovo K8 Note comes with 4000 mAh battery with the support for Turbo Charging, and there is a 15W charger that comes along with it. To be fair, while the phone can see up to a day with a single charge under heavy usage and can see slightly more than a day when used moderately, we expected slightly more, given the performance of other devices with similar sized batteries. Turbo Charging is definitely a help and can give you a few hours’ worth of battery life in 15-20 minutes.. The K Note series is known for its multimedia prowess, and the K8 Note delivers in this regard. It comes with Lenovo’s very own TheaterMax technology which takes all the content on your phone and makes it appear as if you are seeing it on massive display – all you need is a pair of simple VR glasses. No special content needed, just hit the power button to activate VR split-screen mode. The phone is sound on the sound front too – Dolby Atmos support on headphones, which also helps with the call quality. And once again, all this actually works. Playing a high-end game on the phone with TheaterMax glasses and headphones plugged in can be quite an experience. Other connectivity options on the phone included; Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB OTG, 4G LTE, FM radio, and GPS.. If we had to give the K8 Note a dollar for every time it impressed us; we would have been broke by now. At Rs 13,999 for the 4GB RAM/64GB ROM combination, the Lenovo K8 Note definitely comes across as one of the major contenders in its price band. The smartphone has pretty much hit a home run on most of the strikes – the camera, the UI, the multimedia performance, the overall performance…we would not be exaggerating to say that the Lenovo K8 Note has just set a new benchmark for its competition. And it is some pretty stiff competition: the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, the Honor 6X and even its own brother from another mother, the Moto G5 Plus. We have a word of advice for every phone that is priced in the vicinity of the K8 Note. For, there’s a Killer Note in town.. Battery performance could have been better.
