Chạy hệ điều hành mới, kiểu dáng mới cùng màn hình cảm ứng phân giải cao, chiếc smartphone Bold Touch 9900 là sản phẩm đang rất được mong chờ của RIM..

Máy ảnh Fixed focus giao diện không trực quan. Phải tháo pin và khởi động lại máy nếu thay thẻ nhớ. Màn hình cảm ứng là một sự cách tân lớn của BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900. Nhìn trực diện bề mặt máy cho cảm giác mặt trước được chia đều ra làm hai, bên trên là màn hình cảm ứng (2,8 inch) và nửa dưới là bàn phím QWERTY và các phím điều hướng.Mặt sau được làm từ chất liệu sợi thủy tinh, khác với các smartphone trước đây được làm bằng da. Các cạnh được bo tròn cho cảm giác cầm tay thoải mái.Người dùng BlackBerry có lẽ không còn lạ gì viền kim loại được thiết kế quanh máy, nhưng chúng trông tuyệt hơn trên một chiếc máy mỏng hơn như Bold Touch 9900. Bold Touch 9900 sẽ đòi hỏi bạn những kĩ năng sử dụng mới, khác với các smartphone trong dòng Bold của BlackBerry.. 2,8 inch cho trải nghiệm tuyệt vời, độ nhạy tốt. Điểm yếu duy nhất đó là Bold Touch 9900 thiếu tính năng phản hồi xúc giác. Sử dụng Bold Touch 9900 dưới ánh sáng mặt trời không hề bị lóa.Bàn phím QWERTY cho cảm giác thoải mái. Phím bấm mềm mại hơn so với các máy BlackBerry Bold khác cho phép bạn gõ phím chính xác hơn.Phím khá nhỏ nhưng được thiết kế phù hợp và được chạm trổ cẩn thận cho người dùng. Nếu bạn có một bàn tay quá to thì bàn phím của Bold Touch 9900 mới có thể gây ra một ít phiền toái. Bất tiện duy nhất là đường vân kim loại phân chia giữa các hàng phím.. Có nhiều phím (cả số lẫn chữ) có thể dùng để gán dùng để thực hiện cuộc gọi nhanh chóng. Phím * để khóa bàn phím và phím # để chuyển sang chế độ im lặng.Phím gọi và phím điều hướng có khá to và chắc chắn, không gây phiền toái khi sử dụng.. Trên cùng là đèn LED truyền thống, cảm biến xa gần cùng tai nghe.. Mua BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 online và nhận hàng tại nhà ngay hôm nay. Bên trái là jack cắm 3,5 mm cùng cổng microUSB chuẩn.. Mặt phải gồm phím âm lượng cùng một phím tiện ích cho phép bạn gán chức năng sử dụng (theo mặc định, phím này được sử dụng để chụp ảnh).. Phần dưới không có phím điều khiển hay cổng kết nối nào.. Mặt sau máy là máy ảnh 5 MP và đèn LED flash. Loa máy được bố trí dưới vỏ pin.. Pin 1230 mAh Li-Po cho phép 307 giờ chờ và 6 tiếng 30 phút đàm thoại. Thử nghiệm thực tế cho thấy pin máy có thể dùng được 2 ngày sử dụng thường xuyên.. Bold Touch 9900 rộng hơn và tròn hơn, nhìn không sắc nét như dòng BlackBerry 97xx.. Hệ điều hành, trackpad và màn hình cảm ứng. Với BlackBerry OS 7, Bold Touch 9900 được trang bị NFC và khả năng quay HD video. Hệ điều hành có giao diện “hao hao” giống QNX trên máy tính bảng. Các biểu tượng được thay đổi để “bắt chước” với giao diện trên PlayBook. Ngoài ra, các chức năng còn lại không có quá nhiều thay đổi.. Khu Status gồm một hàng các nút bấm ảo, cho phép bạn chuyển đổi giữa các chức năng như Wi-Fi, NFC, nhanh chóng. Bạn cũng có thể dễ dàng truy cập vào các cài đặt cũng như chuông báo thức của máy.. Hệ điều hành cho phép bạn tìm kiếm bằng giọng nói. Để sử dụng, bạn gõ nhẹ vào biểu tượng mic cạnh thanh tìm kiếm để kích hoạt.. Bạn có thể dễ dàng truy cập các ghi chú, cuộc gọi bị nhỡ, hay email chưa đọc dễ dàng bằng cách bấm vào thanh nằm giữa biểu tượng tìm kiếm và biểu tượng profile trên màn hình mặc định. Dù chạy hệ điều hành mới, nhưng danh bạ trong điện thoại của máy không có gì thay đổi so với trước đây. Danh bạ được sắp xếp theo tên, cho phép tìm kiếm nhanh, cho phép sắp xếp theo các mục riêng như gia đình, bạn bè, công việc…. BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 hỗ trợ cả. Một số ứng dụng nhắn tin IM cũng được cài sẵn trong máy. Nếu muốn sử dụng email trên Bold Touch 9900, bạn phải đăng kí tài khoản BlackBerrry Internet Service.. Bold Touch 9900 hỗ trợ video định dạng DivX, XviD, H.264/MPEG-4 và WMV độ phân giải 720p. XviD không phải lúc nào cũng mượt mà. Một số file XviD có thể không tương thích do vấn đề bit rate hoặc âm thanh.. Là máy ảnh có độ phân giải cao nhất trong các smartphone BlackBerry. Với giao diện không hề bắt mắt cùng với ít tính tùy biến. Bạn phải thao tác chụp ảnh hầu hết ở chế độ chân dung. Lựa chọn duy nhất bạn có thể tùy biến là độ phân giải, được bố trí trong phần cài đặt nâng cao.. Không có cài đặt trợ sáng, cân bằng trắng hay tùy chỉnh ISO. Máy ảnh có chức năng nhận dạng khuôn mặt.. Chất lượng ảnh của máy đạt ở mức trung bình. Độ tương phản tốt, nhưng độ nhiễu ảnh lại khá cao.. Đây là một trong những smartphone của BlackBerry cho phép quay video HD cùng với model 9860 và 9810. Máy cho phép quay video với độ phân giải 1280×720 tốc độ 30 khung hình/giây. Đèn LED có thể được sử dụng để lấy sáng.. Chất lượng video tốt, khung hình tốt, độ nhiễu cũng ở mức chấp nhận được, màu sắc và tương phản có chất lượng cao..

Cổng microUSB chuẩn có thể dùng làm sạc pin, cho phép đồng bộ nhạc trong iTunes.. Điểm yếu: không hỗ trợ Flash. Lướt web trên Bold Touch 9900 có thể coi là mượt mà nhất so với các máy BlackBerry gần đây: nhanh, nhạy, hỗ trợ zoom đa chạm, chọn text… Điều đáng tiếc nhất là nó không hỗ trợ Flash.. Trình duyệt hỗ trợ duyệt web theo thẻ, chất lượng render trang tốt.. Máy cung cấp phần mềm Quick Office bản full cài đặt sẵn, cho phép xem xem các định dạng văn bản phổ biến (có cả PDF). Ứng dụng Facebook và Twitter cũng được cài sẵn để bạn dễ dàng. BlackBerry App World (kho ứng dụng). Chợ ứng dụng của RIM có cả ứng dụng trả phí lẫn miễn phí, hỗ trợ bạn thanh toán qua thẻ tín dụng hoặc Paypal. Không ấn tượng như Android market hay App Store, kho ứng dụng của BlackBerry chỉ đạt con số 14.500. với 3.500 trò chơi và 12.000 themes. Một tin đáng buồn nữa là số ứng dụng miễn phí là không nhiều.. Máy tích hợp GPS và hỗ trợ. BlackBerry Maps cho phép người dùng chia sẻ địa điểm với bất cứ ai qua email hay SMS.. Màn hình cảm ứng bên cạnh bàn phím QWERTY truyền thống đã tạo nên sự khác biệt của Bold Touch 9900.. Hai phong cách trên cùng một chiếc máy nhưng không gây trồng chéo. Bold Touch 9900 dường như không có điểm yếu và dường như là sản phẩm mà người ta đang mong chờ từ RIM. Bộ xử lý tốc độ 1.2GHz cùng bộ nhớ RAM khá lớn.. Tốc độ khởi động, đa phương tiện hay game không phải là yếu tố mà RIM tập trung vào smartphone này. Điều mà Bold Touch 9900 làm được chính là trải nghiệm người dùng, tiện lợi và ổn định – sự lựa chọn hàng đầu của doanh nhân.. Tính năng quay Video cũng không phải là điểm mạnh. Ngược lại, kết nối NFC là một tiện ích rõ ràng cho người phải thường xuyên thực hiện các công việc liên quan đến thanh toán, tài chính..
