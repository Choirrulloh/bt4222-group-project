Reviews over de Sony Xperia L1. De nieuwe mobiel is in reparatie. Hoe die is weet ik nog niet. Toestelspecificaties voor de Sony Xperia L1. Afmetingen (l x b x h). Beschrijving over de Sony Xperia L1. In maart 2017 introduceerde Sony een nieuwe budgetsmartphone: de Xperia L1. Het is een slanke smartphone met een mooi en groot 5.5 inch HD-display en vloeiende prestaties. Voor een kleine prijs heb je de smartphone van Sony al in huis. De Xperia L1 is verkrijgbaar in de kleuren zwart en wit en draait op de laatste versie van Android.. Maak in een handomdraai de mooiste foto’s en selfies met de uitstekende camera’s op de smartphone. De 13 megapixel hoofdcamera op de Xperia L1 maakt gedetailleerde foto’s, net als de 5 megapixel selfiecamera op de voorkant.. De smartphone wordt aangedreven door een MediaTek MT6737-chip met vier cores en 2 GB werkgeheugen. Dat is ruim voldoende voor het switchen tussen verschillende, niet te zware apps. Verder bevat de smartphone 16 GB opslaggeheugen dat is uit te breiden met een geheugenkaartje. Op de achtergrond werkt Smart Cleaner om jouw Xperia L1 altijd de maximale kracht te geven. Smart Cleaner stopt daarnaast jouw activiteiten automatisch wanneer deze niet gebruikt worden om batterij te besparen.. Onze klantenservice is 7 dagen per week bereikbaar.

You can think of the Sony Xperia L1 as a successor to the older Xperia E family, but more relevant to the average shopper is the kind of company it keeps within its price range.. At a wallet-friendly £159, the Xperia L1 is prowling the same territory as budget big cats such as the Moto G5 and classy alternatives such as the Wileyfox Swift 2. Unfortunately for Sony, it can’t quite live up to such distinguished company.. I’ll say this for Sony – you know one of its phones when you see one. For years now, the Japanese manufacturer has stuck with a blocky design language all its own.. If you had to name a phone you’d least like dropped on your head from an upstairs window, it would probably be a Sony Xperia. Pushed to be a bit more specific, the Sony Xperia L1 might well be the phone you’d select.. This is a seriously hefty bit of kit at 151mm tall and 8.7mm thick, while it weighs a pocket-sagging 180g. It’s all-plastic, but unlike other such phones it doesn’t attempt to hide that fact, which is a laudable design decision.. There’s something reassuringly sturdy about the Xperia L1’s undisguised matte plastic rear panel and plain, gently curved sides. It also has the kind of sharp corners that would serve you well in the impending zombie apocalypse.. Another reason for the Sony Xperia L1’s heft is its typically huge Sony bezel around the display. The ones to the side aren’t so bad, but the bottom bezel is pretty sizeable for a phone with no home button, and the phone’s forehead is a veritable Frankenstein’s monster of a thing.. Utilitarian looks aside, the Sony Xperia L1 actually feels pretty nice in the hand. Its weightiness gives the impression of quality, while that matte plastic ensures that it won’t be slipping out of your grip any time soon.. The phone’s power button and volume buttons are placed in the usual position on the right-hand edge of the phone, but they’re plain and untextured, so it can be tough to distinguish them by feel alone. On the bottom edge you get the phone’s USB-C port – a welcome inclusion over micro-USB – and a solitary speaker; there’s a 3.5mm jack on top.. There’s one major hardware omission here: a complete lack of a fingerprint sensor. Both the Moto G5 and the Wileyfox Swift 2 have decent examples at an identical price, so there’s absolutely no excuse for this. Indeed, even the £85 Vodafone Smart N8 has a strong fingerprint sensor of its own.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

Sony has been one of the bolder manufacturers when it comes to pushing screen technology in recent times. At the top end with the Sony Xperia XZ Premium , it’s just about the only smartphone maker pushing 4K, when most of the rest have settled on 2K (aka QHD).. It’s a shame Sony doesn’t show similar boldness at the lower end of the market. The Sony Xperia L1 has a 5.5-inch IPS display, but it comes with only a 720p resolution.. There’s nothing inherently wrong with such a spec – the iPhone 7’s screen isn’t far off 720p, after all – but when such a screen strays over the 5-inch mark you can start to see the individual pixels.. Going back to those aforementioned rivals, the Wileyfox Swift 2 is 720p but in a more compact – and thus more pixel-dense – 5-inch form factor, while the Moto G5 goes one better with a 5-inch 1080p screen. Both are smaller, but both are sharper.. It’s a shame, because in every other respect the Sony Xperia L1 screen is pretty good. It’s bright and clear, while colour reproduction is strong for a budget phone. Sony likes the tone to be icy-blue by default, but you can tinker with the white balance in the Settings menu if you’re after a warmer feel. We don’t expect phones to be super-quick at this price point, but we’re past the time where the Sony Xperia L1’s mediocre performance could simply have been shrugged off. Not when the likes of the Moto G5 and the Wileyfox Swift 2 kick along nicely with capable 4-series Snapdragon processors.. Using the Xperia L1 isn’t a bad experience, but there’s a general wallowy feel to even simple tasks. There are small but noticeable pauses when dragging down to bring up Sony’s universal search function, or when swiping to the left to bring up Google Now. The camera seems to take seconds to load up.. It doesn’t take long to identify the culprit: a MediaTek MT6737T CPU, which is a truly low-end piece of silicon. It’s pretty much the same chip – although clocked slightly higher – recently employed in the Vodafone Smart N8, a phone that costs around half the price.. You get 2GB of RAM to back up that modest CPU , but that’s pretty much the minimum for any Android phone shooting for a smooth experience.. The Xperia L1’s setup does ensure competent gaming performance, though. Guns of Boom’s slick online FPS action runs reasonably well, barring a few stutters when the action heats up, while Reckless Racing 3 and Oz: Broken Kingdom were jittery but playable during my time with the phone. 2D efforts such as Guns Of Mercy and Wayward Souls ran flawlessly, as you’d expect these days.. A Geekbench 4 multi-core score of 1881 shows just how short the Xperia L1 is of its main rival, the Moto G5. Motorola’s current budget king managed a score of 2440..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars Worthwhile if upgrading from an inferior model, but do your research.. I purchased this as an upgrade to a Moto G4 Play which was running LineageOS 14.1 (AOSP 7.1.2 Nougat). I needed a phone with a more reliable GPS, and the NFC option (for things like Android Pay) greatly enticed me (though I've yet to really try it out just yet). After having the phone a few days, here are my thoughts: + The Xperia L1's GPS includes GLONASS (Russian satellite support), something the entire Moto G series desperately needed. Satellite lock is almost instant and very accurate. The L1 also has a magnetometer (digital compass) which was absent in the Moto G series. + The Xperia L1's screen, while lower pixel density (267ppi vs 294 on the G4 Play), has much better color saturation. The screen is also half an inch larger, ideal for using Nougat's multi-window mode. = The L1's 13MP camera is about on par with the Moto G4 Play's 8MP camera when using auto-focus. However, the manual shot mode on the L1 does appear to have a decent array of options which might give it a competitive edge in the hands of an experienced photographer. = The Xperia L1 comes with Android 7.0 out of the box, while the G4 Play claims it will update to 7.1.1 through standard OTA. Motorola has had numerous delays in deploying this update, hence the initial need to use a custom ROM. There aren't too many differences, honestly, and the L1 is already getting a steady stream of support updates, making them evenly matched in software. = Bluetooth problems seem to be inherent on all Nougat devices right now, including Google's own flagship Pixel devices. The G4 Play running Lineage 14.1 will often disconnect from Bluetooth when connecting/disconnecting a Wi-Fi network, and phone calls on Bluetooth can occasionally force a reboot. Meanwhile, on the Xperia L1, the connection is stable but much shorter. Audio becomes finicky as far away as 5 meters on a device with a max range of 30 meters. = The L1's USB-C connector is still using the 2.0 standard, giving it roughly the same data transfer and charge rates as the G4 Play's MicroUSB port. However, the Type-C port feels a lot sturdier than the old MicroUSB port, which justifies the necessity of newer (better) cables. - The L1's MediaTek 6737T, despite having better benchmarks than the G4 Play's Snapdragon 410, has considerably more lag. This was a major disappointment for me as someone who uses their phone for EVERYTHING. Apps take a bit longer to open, and the keyboard has a slightly poorer response rate. - The L1 has a glass screen with a hardness of 6. However, it's so thick that if you try and place a tempered glass screen protector on top of it, the touch screen struggles to register much of anything. This means you need to go without and be a lot more careful than you would need to be with the G4 Play, which happily accepts tempered glass screen protectors. Is the Xperia L1 worth $200? I would say it's worth close enough to $200 not to matter. It more than makes up for the limitations of the Moto G4 Play, though it would have done better with a processor to match. It can beat out some phones in its class (like the Nokia 3), but other phones (like the upcoming Moto E4) might give it a run for its money (provided Motorola does not make the same mistakes twice)..

FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Putting together a good smartphone for beginners can often turn out to be an even tougher task than designing a flagship. Maybe that's why Sony is retiring its E-series and introducing a new contender in the Xperia L1.. Sony previously covered the budget niche with the pocket-friendly E series, some water-proofed handsets in the M lineup, and the selfie-centric C-series; this added adequate depth and continuity all the way up to the flagship Z lineup.. Now the Xperia X is in charge, and Sony is obviously keen on revising its alphabet further down the ranks.. Other than the name change, the newly unveiled Xperia L1 isn't dramatically different from the typical Sony entry-level handset we're used to. Almost a year sharp after the Xperia E5, we get a premium looped surface design - well executed given the tight budget - as well as a big screen, LTE connectivity and a high-res camera. Reasonably priced and powered by an up-to-date Android version, this starter package has all the right bases covered.. The Mediatek chipset is perhaps the biggest question mark - a small bump in clock speed over the Xperia E5 will hardly help the four Cortex-A53 cores make a difference and the graphics chip isn't particularly good either. That said, two of the most likely rivals, Nokia 3 and the Moto C Plus, are relying on the same chip to do the math.. Anyway, if Sony optimized the performance right, the Xperia L1 will be going places. Amid recent reports of improving smartphone sales, another potentially strong seller in the pipeline would be a welcome boost for the recovering company.. Let's get on with it then - the Xperia L1 is coming out of the box right after the break.. Retail box, 360-degree spin, design 3.

The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $130 Buy. $200 Buy.

Sony's L1 looks the part but is it too underpowered?. SHOULD I BUY SONY XPERIA L1?. How does Sony's Xperia L1 compare to other budget phones? Find out in our review. How does Sony's Xperia L1 compare to other budget phones? Find out in our review. 1.45 GHz Mediatek MT6737T quad-core processor. Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices. First announced in March 2017, the Xperia L1 has come to replace Sony’s now discontinued E series. Priced at a surprisingly cheap £169, the L1 is Sony’s newest attempt at shaking up the budget phone market. Its large screen and sleek design make us think of Sony’s higher range of smartphones: it would be hard to single it out as the cheapest model in a line of Xperias. But at such a bargain price, we can’t expect it to perform as well as its more expensive counterparts. So how does the L1 hold up to other low-budget smartphones? Here’s our Xperia L1 review.. The L1’s pricing makes for a great part of its appeal. Now available in the UK, you can easily pick one up from most retailers at an original price of £169.John Lewis. currently carries the black and white models and you can find the pink version at Argos. Some seem to offer even cheaper prices, like Alza or CSMobiles. In the UK, the L1 is available with 2GB RAM and 16GB of internal storage.. Our review unit came in matte black but the L1 is also available in white and pink. The familiar shape used by Sony on its Xperia line makes it look like a much more expensive smartphone than it actually is. Of course, the budget costs are noticeable in the choice of material. The L1 is made of a plastic shell, not quite as attractive as the XZ ’s metal back. But the material gives it a sturdy feel and makes it easier to grip, a notable asset considering its size.. At 151x74x8.7mm, the L1 is one of the largest phones you’ll find at this price and the dimensions can make it quite hard to hold and use with just one hand. But if a larger screen is part of what you’re looking for, its large 5.5in screen with narrow borders delivers. You should note, though, that large bezels remain on top and at the bottom of the screen. Its weight of 180g makes it a little bit heavier than some smartphones of its size, but it’s definitely not too heavy.. The L1’s budget means it lacks a fingerprint sensor which means you’ll have to unlock your phone using the old-fashioned password or pattern. Other than that, there aren’t many changes to the button layout. The power/unlock and volume buttons are on the same side, but their difference in size ensure you won’t mistake them. The headphone jack is on the top left and the L1 is also equipped with an USB-C port. The microSD card slot, on the high left, will enable you to expand storage up to 256GB.. The L1 only has one speaker but the ‘Loud’ option will enable you to hear just fine. Of course, it also has a selfie camera on top of the screen, and the camera and LED flash can be found in their regular position at the back. The phone’s overall look, despite using cheaper materials, is more than satisfactory.. The L1 manages to provide a fancy design without suffering too many losses but the internal specs are where it most cut corners. It is powered by a low-range Mediatek MT6737T chip, with a 1.45 GHz Quad-core CPU and a Mali-T720MP2 GPU.. Because of the slower chip, the phone tends to take a little bit longer than we’d like to open apps or take pictures. The scrolling is also quite slow, which can be annoying.. The benchmark results justify the general slow feel of the phone. Though it outperforms some of its concurrents, the results explain why the phone takes a long time to open the photo app or a google doc.. The 5.5in screen display is only 720p and comes with a pixel density of 267 ppi. The overall quality is satisfying for its price range but you can expect to see some pixels if you zoom in on pictures. The rear camera is 13Mp with LED flash and allows for clear pictures in good lighting.. The results won’t be so good in darker environments due to lack of contrast, and the camera can struggle to focus on the subject. The 5Mp front camera is quite standard and what you’d expect to find on the L1 for its price, though it is enough to satisfy selfie addicts.. The L1 is equipped with a 2620mAh battery which enables 11 hours of talktime on 3G, 63 hours on music play or around 8 hours of web-browsing. After 45 minutes of gameplay, the battery had lost 10%. With low to average use, the phone will be able to last for over a day. If you want to use it to watch videos, listen to long podcasts or spend a while browsing the internet, you will need to charge it every night.. The L1 comes loaded with Android Nougat 7.0. The app menu does not differ from the usual stock Android look, with a Google shortcut when you swipe left and access to the apps when you swipe right. It also has the usual pull down notification panel which gives you quick access to recently used apps. If you’re used to Android, the L1 does not present any challenge and it does not lack essential features either.. As usual, Sony has replaced most of Google’s apps with their own, which means you’ll find Sony Music, Photo and Video apps. The L1 also comes with Sony’s ‘What’s new’ application which gives you suggestions for new games, themes or films you might enjoy. It also has the ‘Xperia Lounge’ which is quite similar but comes up with offers on diverse products or services related to Sony. Neither represent a major asset to the phone.. 1.45 GHz Mediatek MT6737T quad-core processor. 13MP main camera, LED flash, support for 1080p video at 30fps. 1.45 GHz Mediatek MT6737T quad-core processor. 13MP main camera, LED flash, support for 1080p video at 30fps. If design and screen size are you main preoccupations, then the L1 is definitely the budget phone you need. Its resemblance to Sony’s higher range smartphones and the large screen it offers make it one of the best looking phones of its price-range.. The benchmark results and general slowness when multitasking hold it back, and if you plan on using it for intense gaming or video streaming, you might be better off with something else. If not, the L1 is an attractive budget phone and should be more than enough to satisfy your basic needs. Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices.

Mobiles / Sony Mobile Phones / Sony Xperia L1 Price in India. User Visits: 790 Compare. Sony recently launched the budget-friendly smartphone called L1 and it is a big step for the brand known for premium handsets. However, as expected, the cost cutting measures by the brand to offer this handset in the range of INR 10,000. While the premium handsets from the brand are commended, this one should be given a miss. Here is a brief overview of the handset to clear why this handset does not receive any love from our end.. USB Type C : The only highlight of this handset has to be the USB Type-C port on the rear panel of the device. The USB port brings reversible USB, fast charging and fast data transfer to the handset by default. However, apart from this, the handset has nothing that is not already there in budget segment.. No Fingerprint scanner: The brand has placed the handset in INR 10,000 range, which is like premium segment for budget smartphones. In this segment almost every smartphone comes with a fingerprint scanner. However, for some reason Xperia L1 is missing the feature, which is a let down.. MediaTek processor : The second let down in the handset is the MediaTek processor under the hood of the device. At a time when Chinese handset makers are offering Snapdragon powered devices in this range, Sony is just being ridiculous. You can expect the handset to lag a bit and also heat up when used extensively.. Smaller battery :The brand has equipped the device with a 2620 mah battery, which is pretty small for a powerful smartphone. While the handset has been equipped with quick charging, it makes no sense in the segment where we have 4000 mAh handsets.. 9,990 (Expected Price) Sony Xperia L1 is currently not available in any online store..

Attractive screen Expandable storage User friendly OS. Our Sony Xperia L1 review takes a close look at one of Sony’s most affordable phones of 2017. With its simple specs but typical Sony design, is the Xperia L1 a smart choice for anyone on a budget?. Sony Mobile has released a full range of handsets so far in 2017, offering a smartphone for pretty much any kind of budget. From the pricey Xperia XZ Premium (which boasts a 4K HDR screen) down to the great-value (and stunning). Xperia XA1 , chances are you’ll find a Sony blower that’ll meet your everyday needs – without blowing the bank balance.. Even those on a strict budget are now catered for, with the UK release of the Xperia L1. This Sony handset cost just £150 SIM-free, making it even cheaper than the Xperia XA1. The L1 is a direct rival to the likes of the Moto G5 , Lenovo P2 and Huawei P8 Lite 2017 , offering a full smartphone experience for under £200.. So is the Sony Xperia L1 worth your time and cash? Here’s our in-depth review.. Read next: Best Sony phones you can buy in 2017. Although the Xperia L1 is one of the most affordable phones in Sony’s current catalogue, you still get some flashes of the Japanese giant’s typical design language. That iconic, sharp rectangular finish is similar to the Xperia XZ and XZ Premium’s frame. The top and bottom edges might not be completely flat, while the Xperia L1’s body is of course constructed from plastic, but at least the handset clearly belongs to the Sony Mobile family.. One-handed use is a bit tricky as this budget blower is a mighty 5.5-incher. Combine that spacious screen with the thick bezels above and below the display, and you’re definitely better off with two hands at all times. Still, using a single mitt is just about manageable in a pinch.. The Xperia L1 isn’t water resistant, matching most other budget mobiles under the £200 price point. Neither is that plastic finish particularly durable. After just 24 hours of (admittedly constant) use, the rear end already had a permanent scar etched into the surface. If you grab an L1 of your own, you’ll want to treat it with serious respect to keep it looking fresh.. The SIM card and microSD memory card slip into hidden slots, which are concealed behind a pull-out flap. This flap is pretty discrete and stays firmly in place when not in use.. At 5.5-inches, this budget blower sports the same screen size as the considerably-more-expensive Xperia XZ Premium. Of course, you don’t get those same luscious 4K visuals or HDR support here, as you’d hopefully expect. Neither do you get the Full HD resolution of the Moto G5, which costs about the same.. Rather, Sony has gone with a basic 720p HD IPS screen for the Xperia L1. While that means images are less crisp than those produced by Motorola’s rival, you’ll still have to squint to make out individual pixels. High-def movies and photos look good, with eye-pleasing colour reproduction (considering the cost). Viewing angles are solid, while the maximum brightness is also strong.. Sony’s Super Vivid Mode and X-Reality engine are missing in action here, which isn’t a surprise considering the Xperia L1’s budget roots. Still, they aren’t particularly missed, as that panel is still fine for consuming media on the move. Especially given its spacious size, which makes for comfortable viewing.. Audio is pumped out from a dinky speaker on the phone’s bottom edge. Quality isn’t too hot, with most music sounding like a distorted, tinny mess at any kind of volume. Still, it’s fine for watch YouTube videos without the use of headphones.. If you prefer to carry around a big media collection on your phone, rather than streaming from the likes of Spotify and Netflix, the Xperia L1 will suit just fine. Although you only get a paltry 16GB of storage space (with 6 gigs already used up by the OS), you can slot in microSD memory cards up to 256GB in size. Plenty of room for your music and movie collection.. Android Nougat has been jazzed up with Sony’s Unified Design overlay, to set the Xperia L1 apart from every other Android handset out there. This adds some extra functionality and a consistent theme which matches the colour of the hardware.. On other Xperias this includes a funky animated wallpaper, which swirls as you skip around your desktops. The Xperia L1 isn’t up to the challenge however, with its basic performance (more on that later). So instead, you just get a static wallpaper.. Still, Sony’s built-in interactive tutorial is present and correct, helping smartphone noobs to learn about every aspect of their mobile. You don’t get too much crapware pre-installed either, although this does include some duplicate apps. For instance, you not only have Google Photos for viewing your snaps, but also Sony’s Album app.. Sadly there’s no fingerprint sensor on the Xperia L1, even though much cheaper alternative handsets such as the Vodafone Smart N8 sport one. Instead you’ll have to rely on a PIN, secret pattern or Google’s smart unlock feature. This allows you to bypass the traditional security barriers if the phone detects a trusted Bluetooth device, well-known GPS location and so on.. With a basic Mediatek 6737 chipset on-board, backed by just 2GB of memory, the Xperia L1 is designed for quite simple everyday tasks.. Web browsing, messaging, messing around on social media. All reasonably smooth on the L1, although occasionally an app will take a little while to load or the phone will suddenly stammer. However, when you attempt something more extravagant such as a spot of gaming or multitasking with two apps at once, you’ll notice some serious slowdown. If you’re a fairly demanding user, you’ll be better off with the Xperia XA1 (which sports a slightly more beefy Mediatek chipset and an extra gig of RAM).. As for battery life, you can rest assured that the Xperia L1 delivers a full day of use, even with constant fiddling. Get stuck into lots of web browsing, camera use and messaging and you should still make it to bedtime before plugging the L1 in.. If you’re really struggling and need to squeeze every drop of life from the Xperia L1, Sony has included the usual Stamina modes. These cull the most power-hungry features and apps, to stretch your remaining time.. The Xperia L1 sports a basic 13-megapixel Sony snapper on the rear end, with an f/2.2 aperture lens and single LED flash. You also get a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, again with f/2.2 aperture. Both of these cameras are capable of shooting up to Full HD resolution video.. For our in-depth thoughts and plenty of photo and video samples, check out our Xperia L1 camera review .. The Xperia L1 is your typical budget blower, offering some slick Sony styling for the £150 asking price. In some areas it lags behind rivals such as the Moto G5, especially when it comes to performance, while the camera tech isn’t quite as strong either. However, the capable screen, expandable storage and user-friendly interface combine for a satisfying everyday experience.. Sony Xperia L1 in a nutshell: Specs, UK price, release date and more.

Florian Wimmer ( translated by Katherine Bodner), 07/31/2017. Touchscreen Smartphone Android ARM. If you do not consider "solid" as an insult, but instead connect the word with reliability and trustworthiness, then the Sony Xperia L1 might be something for you.

The Sony Xperia L1 has a 5.5-inch display, which is still within the range of phones that can be easily operated with one hand. Our test unit's predecessor (at least by name) is the Sony Xperia L , presented in 2013, which is equivalent to the medieval period of smartphones. Apart from their names, the two devices do not have much in common.. With a price of $200, the Xperia L1 is positioned at the bottom. Phones in this price range usually do not offer convenient features such as fingerprint sensors or a large range of supported LTE networks. What is the difference between the Xperia L1 and its similarly priced competition? Could it be a camera with particularly high resolution? Or extensive software that learns from your inputs? To find out, we have compared the Sony Xperia L1 with other devices such as the. HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle , the. Test device courtesy of notebooksbilliger.de.

Apart from the front, the Sony Xperia L1's case has a rough finish; available colors are black, white and pink. It is designed to fit into Sony's current line, which is great: narrow bezels, a narrow bar below the screen and a slightly wider one above - in total, the display-to-case ratio is very good. The rounded corners make handling very comfortable. The Xperia L1 weighs 180 grams (~6.3 oz), which is rather heavy, and its 8.7 mm (~0.34 in) case is rather thick. Stability is as you would expect from a device of this price: pressure on the front and back is quite visible on the screen and warping makes the case creak and the screen change color.. The battery cannot be removed; there is a slot for the SIM and microSD cards on the left side. The case is not water or dust proof.. Sony Xperia L1 full resolution.

However, you can get better storage solutions for the same price with the Honor 6X , for example. You can effectively use just over 10 GB out of the 16 GB of storage - the other 6 GB are already occupied by the system. It is also possible to insert a microSD card and expand storage by up to 256 GB, but Sony will only let you configure the microSD card as external storage and apps cannot be saved to the memory card.. The USB connection only supports USB 2.0 speeds, but at least the connector can be plugged in either way, as it is a USB Type-C port. The device also has NFC, USB OTG and an FM radio, which is normal for a device of this price range nowadays.. left: SIM and microSD slot behind flap. bottom: microphone, USB C port, speakers. top: 3.5 mm audio jack, microphone. Sony has given the device Android 7.0, a rather new version of the operating system. The security patches are dated May 5th 2017, so are not really up-to-date anymore. Sony smartphones, including the Xperia L1, have their own launcher. This can be customized with different designs, although many of them have to be bought. Apart from that, the device operates just like any other Android phone, so if you are coming from Android you should have no difficulties. The phone also offers a detailed walk-through to help you get accustomed to the new phone. The interface has been made prettier by Sony by adding some animations and symbols to the settings.. The device comes with quite a lot of additional software, for example, Sony's own app store "What's New", which just forwards you to the Google PlayStore, really. The Spotify, Amazon and Facebook apps are obviously advertising apps and AVG Protection Pro offers you an ad-free virus scanner with Pro features for 180 days, after which you have either to accept less features or pay for Pro. Sony's video, picture and music apps double with Google's standard apps. Others, such as PlayStation or the manufacturer's drawing app are missing, but can be installed manually.. As of late, Sony's customized Android also offers tips to improve your experience with the device, based on your behavior. If you let it, the software will even intervene on its own and, for example, deactivate apps that are not used anymore in order to free up working memory and system performance.. The Sony Xperia L1 supports seven LTE frequencies, which is better than most comparison devices, but really only makes sense for Europe. The phone will not have reception in exotic places. Reception in general is good: in the well-developed German D2 network, LTE signal strength was at about 50% in a town apartment. It is a little annoying that you have to restart the smartphone after inserting or taking out a SIM card. The device does not support Hot Swap while it is turned on. It also took quite some time for the device to connect to the network after we first inserted the SIM card.. The device supports the Wi-Fi standards 802.11 a/b/g/n. This includes 5-GHz networks, which most comparison devices do not have. The Xperia L1 also has rather high transfer rates, but of course it cannot keep up with high-end smartphones that support 802.11 ac. HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle is a little faster at transferring data. Wi-Fi reception is great near the router and websites load quickly. At a distance of 10 meters (~32.8 ft) and through three walls, pages still load at a similar speed, but reception drops by about a quarter..

The smartphone was not able to locate us indoors. It took a moment outdoors, but then located us within 8 meters (~26.2 ft), which is not a very good result.. We took the Sony Xperia L1 on a bike ride in order to evaluate its GPS performance properly, and brought the Garmin Edge 500 along, too - a professional navigation system for bicyclists. The measured routes differ by about 250 meters (~273 yds), which is a good result. If you look at the recorded route, you can see that the Xperia L1 performed quite well and managed to record bends and curves quite accurately. It is definitely suitable for leisure-time use..

Even if Sony has given the telephone app a new symbol: it is still the standard Android app that you will find on many other Android smartphones. This was a good decision as the app is well structured and easy to use.. Voice quality while telephoning is average: We could understand our contact clearly via the earpiece, but the sound is distorted and there is a light droning when you turn the volume up. The microphone had similar issues: It managed to transmit when we spoke quietly, but our contact could also hear some rustling and cracking sounds. We could hear our call partner fairly well on speakerphone, but the microphone only registers loud voices and our call partner heard a lot of background noises.. The Xperia L1's cameras are more or less what you would expect from its price range: a main camera with 13 MP resolution and a front camera with 5 MP. Still, some of our comparison devices have been equipped with higher resolution front cameras. Compared to more high-end sensors, the main camera seems to take slightly blurry pictures. The dynamics in light and dark areas are clearly lower than in the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus. The images also seem a little washed out and colors are rather pale. Zooming in confirms the washed-out details and low dynamics. These are the usual problems that camera sensors on smartphones in this price range have. The only exception here is the Honor 6X .. Videos can be recorded in 1080p and 30 frames per second. Again, the colors seem a little pale, but image sharpness is OK. Brightness quickly adapts to the lighting situation; it is not possible to manually focus or change the exposure settings while filming.. The front camera takes good selfies, but light areas can become a little too overpowering and sharpness could be better.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. We also tested the main camera in lab conditions with set lighting, which makes the pictures comparable. The photograph of our test chart shows that surfaces are grainy and patchy. Colors appear quite natural, but writing on red and yellow background is blurry. You can notice the lacking contrast in the image of black writing on brown background, which is hard to read. Image sharpness is average, but remains consistent over the whole image. During our color comparison we noticed that most colors are a little too light and light tones of gray have a brown hue.. ColorChecker: The reference color is in the bottom half of the field.. The device comes with a power supply and USB cable only. for the Xperia L1 on the Sony website.. The manufacturer offers a 24-month warranty.. Sony has chosen SwiftKey as the keyboard app for the Xperia L1. This app is used a lot and offers many settings. Personally, we prefer Google's GBoard keyboard, as we feel that it is a little clearer. Other keyboard apps can be installed from the Google PlayStore.. The touchscreen is easy to use and has a smooth surface that makes gliding easy; the screen is receptive even in the corners. The Android keys are on the screen, which is the only navigation option, as the device has no hardware or touch buttons. The standby button and volume rocker are located on the right side of the case. They are easily identified by touch and have a clear pressure point. Unlike most Sony smartphones, our test unit does not have a dedicated camera button, but the volume rocker can be used as shutter release instead.. The Xperia L1 fulfills our expectations with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels, although the Honor 6X and Huawei P8 Lite have shown that higher resolutions are also possible in this price range. The average screen brightness is at 478 cd/mÂ², which is an average result. It has consistent brightness distribution at 94%, which means even larger areas of color are displayed uniformly.. We measured high-frequency flickering at low brightness levels. This is called Pulse Width Modulation and is a way to lower screen brightness. In this case, the frequency is so high that it should not cause any problems even for sensitive users.. 469 cd/m² 470 cd/m² 470 cd/m² 486 cd/m² 479 cd/m² 485 cd/m² 494 cd/m² 480 cd/m² 466 cd/m². 94 % Center on Battery: 479. cd/m²) ΔE Color 4.5 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 4.1 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.03.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM detected 25510 Hz. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. The display backlight flickers at 25510. Hz is quite high, so most users sensitive to PWM should not notice any flickering.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 8995 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. The high black value of 0.58 cd/m 2 means that black areas look dark gray and contrast is mediocre. Colors are not particularly vivid either.. The CalMAN software and spectrophotometer measured a slight blue cast in light shades of gray; the sRGB color space is covered by 95.2% - although we should consider this result more as a point of reference due to the imprecise method of measurement. White balance can be adjusted manually and made to suit personal preferences..

This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.2 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. At maximum screen brightness, the screen can be read in the sunshine outdoors, but you will often have to move into shade due to the reflective screen.

Sony has chosen the quad-core Mediatek MT6737T with a maximum clock rate of 1.5 GHz. This means the Xperia L1 is not quite as fast as the. Nonetheless, our test unit offered good performance for its price range and even beat the. During everyday use, you can expect the operating system to lag a little occasionally, but usually performance is smooth. Apps and especially games need quite a bit longer to load than on smartphones that are more expensive.. Just as with the SoC, it is positioned in the lower mid-range of our comparison devices..

It can take a while for the images to load on a website and demanding HTML5 games such as. letsplay.ouigo.com cannot be played smoothly (if at all). However, if you always access the same websites and do not often go to demanding pages, the Xperia L1 should be fine.. JetStream 1.1 - 1.1 Total Score Huawei P8 lite 2017.

We can only give a limited recommendation for the Sony Xperia L1 here: There should be no difficulties with very simple games such as " Angry Birds ". If you are interested in playing games that are more demanding, such as " Asphalt 8 ", you will have to lower the details so that it can be displayed smoothly. With " Dead Trigger 2 " you will reach a smooth 30 frames per second -only real high-end smartphones manage to display 60 fps smoothly. Whether the Xperia L1 is suitable for gaming really depends on your expectations.. At least the touchscreen and proximity sensor help ensure happy gaming: they react quickly and reliably.. The Sony Xperia L1 usually keeps to comfortable temperatures if you do not put it under too much load. Under full load it heats up to a maximum of 46.4 Â°C (~115.5 Â°F), which is noticeable and could become uncomfortable particularly in a trouser pocket. Luckily, this heat is limited to the top part of the case.. The smartphone manages to keep up full performance under prolonged load, which we tested with the GFXBench's battery test, Manhattan 3.1.. 44.4 °C 43.8 °C 34.4 °C. 45.4 °C 43.4 °C 34.4 °C. 44.9 °C 43 °C 34.2 °C.

The small speaker at the bottom edge can get quite loud: it reaches a maximum of 89.4 dB(A). We were happy to find out that the sound quality does not distort at maximum volume, although you can tell that the speaker has some difficulties: its sound lacks bass and low mids have a hard time coming through as well. This makes the speaker sound rather poor, although it should be fine for watching an occasional YouTube video or listening to a song.. If you want better sound, you should use the 3.5-mm audio jack positioned at the top edge of the device. It transmits the sound clearly to both headphones and external speakers. Sound quality is also good via Bluetooth. The device offers various settings: although we noticed no difference from the ClearAudio+ sound improvement, the equalizer lets you influence the sound quite a bit.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 31.6 32.9 25 25.4 33 31 25.3 33.5 40 32.9 32.9 50 33.6 35.3 63 31.6 38.3 80 28.4 28.5 100 27 28 125 20.8 33.4 160 22 28.4 200 21.3 30.8 250 20.8 42.5 315 21.2 48.2 400 19.4 56.8 500 19.5 63.4 630 17.7 68.7 800 17.9 74.6 1000 17.8 76.6 1250 17.3 76.8 1600 17.4 74.6 2000 16.7 76.1 2500 17.2 73.9 3150 18.2 74 4000 17.9 79.6 5000 17.6 82.3 6300 17.7 84.2 8000 17.8 77.4 10000 17.9 73.5 12500 18.1 72.2 16000 18.2 69 SPL 30 89.4 N 1.3 79.4 median 17.9 Sony Xperia L1 median 73.5 Delta 1.3 12.6 31.6 42.6 25.4 37.5 25.3 34.6 32.9 31.3 33.6 30.9 31.6 32.4 28.4 29.7 27 28.4 20.8 29.2 22 31.7 21.3 36.9 20.8 46 21.2 52.3 19.4 55.8 19.5 59.1 17.7 60.8 17.9 66.6 17.8 71.5 17.3 75 17.4 72.3 16.7 72.7 17.2 71.6 18.2 70.7 17.9 67.6 17.6 66.6 17.7 61.6 17.8 56.5 17.9 57.1 18.1 56.9 18.2 42.2 30 81.9 1.3 46.3 median 17.9 Honor 6X median 59.1 1.3 11 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Frequency diagram in comparison (checkboxes above can be turned on/off). Although the Xperia L1 consumes rather little power while idling and has normal consumption rates on standby and when turned off, rates increase dramatically under load. We measured a maximum of 6.94 watts, which is the highest value of all comparison devices..

Considering the comparatively high consumption rates, it is no surprise that the Sony Xperia L1 cannot get particularly long battery runtimes out of the small battery with only 2620 mAh or almost 10 Wh. Yes, the LG K10 manages half an hour less in the Wi-Fi test, but apart from that the battery runtimes of our comparison devices are a lot longer. The Honor 6X lasts particularly long: almost 16 hours. The Xperia L1 only managed 9:27 hours. This is still OK and can even last two days with average use.. The smartphone has adaptive charging technology, which is supposed to prolong the life of the battery. The enclosed power supply even supports quick charge, although the Xperia L1 does not support this feature according to Sony. Nonetheless, the smartphone was fully recharged in just over an hour, which is quite fast.. Idle (without WLAN, min brightness) 23h. NBC WiFi Websurfing Battery Test 1.3 9h.

The Sony Xperia L1 is a lower mid-range smartphone that offers a sound performance in most areas. If you expect no more from your smartphone than to work and occasionally shoot a photo, you will be very happy with this device. Even though some might complain about the bloatware in the system and the high temperatures under load can be annoying, there are several areas in which the Sony Xperia L1 is quite convincing: the precise GPS module, the extensive and up-to-date software, its good input devices and a display with good color accuracy, for example.. The screen, camera, and battery runtime are what can be expected from the Xperia L1's price range. The smartphone stands out with its fancy case and precise GPS module. If you want no more than a well-functioning smartphone, you will be quite happy with the Xperia L1.. If you expect your smartphone to have a high-resolution screen, more internal storage and a better camera, you can get the Honor 6X for a few dollars more. But if you would like a reliable smartphone with a nice case and an affordable price, the Xperia L1 might be something for you.. Sony Xperia L1 - 2017-07-27 07/27/2017 v6 Florian Wimmer.
