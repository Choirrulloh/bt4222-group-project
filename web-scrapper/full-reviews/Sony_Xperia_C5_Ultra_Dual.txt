Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual Review: A Big Screen Phone Done Right. Kunal Dua , 16 October 2015. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual is the third 'Ultra' device to have launched in India. Sony introduced the moniker with the Xperia Z Ultra , which was a flagship-level device in terms of specifications, but had a screen that was almost tablet-like as far as the size is concerned. The device got good reviews , though it was perhaps a little ahead of its time as far as people's comfort with huge phones is concerned, and in the end, perhaps just a little bit too big for its own good.. With the next member of the series, Sony toned things down a bit with the launch of the Xperia T2 Ultra Dual , which had a 6-inch display. Sadly, the rest of the specs were watered down as well. The T2 Ultra was a mid-ranger at best in terms of specifications; a correction that diverged a bit too far from the Xperia Z Ultra.. In that sense, the Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual , which was announced in August this year, seems to strike the right balance between size and specifications while still living up to the 'Ultra' moniker. A little over two years after the Xperia Z Ultra was launched, how will Sony's latest attempt perform in the real world? Let's find out.. Design and display If you are even considering buying the Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual, you hopefully know this very basic fact about the device - it's a big phone. While Sony has managed to shave a millimetre of length and more than 4mm of width compared to the Xperia T2 Ultra dual, the Xperia C5 Ultra is still large enough to be noticed wherever you go. The Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual is heavier and slightly thicker than the T2 Ultra, while also sporting a marginally smaller battery.. In terms of build quality, we have no complaints about the Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual. Our white review unit had a glossy back finish, which is also the case with the other two colours the phone is available in - Black and Soft Mint. The glossy back means the phone is a little prone to smudges, but they aren't really noticeable until you look carefully, at least on the white version. Though plastic and glass dominate most of the back and front, the Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual is built around a metallic frame, with plastic corners ostensibly to allow for better antenna performance.. In terms of the layout of ports, there's nothing extraordinary here, which is good. The 3.5mm audio port sits on the top of the device, with the Micro-USB port and microphone making their presence felt at the bottom. The left has a cover that can be pulled out to reveal the distinct microSD and dual Nano-SIM trays. The Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual comes with on-screen Back, Home, and Application Switcher buttons.. The most striking part of the right is the signature metallic, circular power button placed slightly above the halfway mark. There's a volume rocker right below that, followed by the dedicated camera button towards the bottom. There's a Sony logo right above the display, with a notification LED to its left, and the 13-megapixel selfie camera and a LED flash to its right. The back is pretty symmetrical, with six centre-aligned elements - the rear camera, LED flash, and a noise-cancelling microphone followed by three logos.. The phone is obviously big overall, but even those with medium-sized hands shouldn't have trouble holding the device. We needed to shift our grip to reach the upper regions of the screen, which is no surprise given the size of the display. Overall, the design of the Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual is quite comfortable and ergonomic for a device of its size.. The Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual comes with a 6-inch full-HD display, a welcome improvement over the Xperia T2 Ultra dual, which had a 720p panel which just doesn't look good when scaled up to this size. The screen goes edge-to-edge on the left and right, which explains how Sony has been able to make the C5 Ultra narrower than the T2 Ultra and still maintain the same display size.. By default, the colours on the display of the Xperia C5 Ultra Dual are rather neutral - some may even call them boring - but you can choose between the Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2 and the Super-vivid mode options from the settings to find a colour gamut that's more to your taste. You can manually adjust the white balance as well, if you are into that kind of stuff. The display has good viewing angles and is sufficiently bright, though you may find yourself manually adjusting the settings to see things at maximum brightness.. Software and performance The Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual is powered by a 1.7GHz oct-core MediaTek MT6752 SoC along with 2GB RAM. It comes with 16GB of internal storage, out of which almost 9GB is accessible by users. Pre-installed apps include Chrome, Facebook, News from Socialife, BIGFLIX, OfficeSuite, AVG, Jive, Real Football and File Commander amongst others, though a majority of these apps can be uninstalled to get more free space. You can get up to 200GB of additional storage via the microSD slot.. The Xperia C5 Ultra Dual runs Android 5.0 Lollipop with Sony's own skin on top. Sony has added some useful features keeping in mind the extra real estate on offer on this big phone. For example, you have 'small apps', the company's take on floating apps that can run on top of other apps. You can choose from a bunch of pre-installed small apps, download more from the Play Store, or run your favourite widget as a small app. Sony has also tweaked some parts of the UI for easier operation with one hand (see screenshots below).. Note how the keypad has shifted to the left to make it a little easier to reach the keys when holding the Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual in your left hand. Tap the arrow to shift it towards the right.. The Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual had no problems playing a full-HD video file encoded at a high bitrate, and games like Asphalt 8 ran without any hiccups or dropped frames. We played the game for over 20 minutes at a stretch, and while the phone got noticeably warm, overheating was never really a concern. The phone comes with 4G support and is compatible with the LTE networks deployed in India so far.. We faced no issues in terms of call quality, though the loudspeaker sounded rather tinny, especially relative to the overall size of the device. The Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual comes with FM radio and USB OTG support. Thanks to the large screen, the on-screen keyboard feels well spaced out, which, combined with the good default keyboard, means the overall experience is amongst the best we've had while typing on glass.. Camera and battery life The Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual has a 13-megapixel rear camera, which is not uncommon these days. However, the phone's front camera also sports the same resolution, which is a number that's been touched only by a handful of phones. For all its struggles in the smartphone business, Sony phones have traditionally been known for their good cameras - something that's backed up by the fact Sony's camera unit supplies sensors to some of the world's top smartphone manufacturers including Apple - and the Xperia C5 Ultra Dual is no exception.. The rear camera takes good-looking pictures with largely accurate colour reproduction when there's ample light, but the amount of detail captured could have been improved. While initially we weren't entirely happy with the low light performance of the camera, we received a software update (build 29.0.B.1.55) during the time we spent with the device which seemed to bring improvements on this front.. Sample shot by rear camera (left/ top) and selfie camera (right/ bottom). Coming to the monstrous selfie camera, it's safe to say that the images captured by it are amongst the best we've seen from a front shooter. Video captured by the front and rear cameras was of average quality. As far as the software is concerned, the camera app that ships on the Xperia C5 Ultra Dual is the one we've seen on other Xperia smartphones as well. It comes with some pre-installed modes and you can extend its capabilities by downloading more modes. The app has enough to keep everyone happy - those looking for stress-free clicking, and even people who desire a bit more control over their pictures.. The performance of the Xperia C5 Ultra Dual in our battery video loop test was average, with just under 8 hours of playback time. In terms of real world usage, we had no problems getting through our work days on a single charge. This anomaly is not uncommon with big-screen phones, which tend to underperform in test scenarios that require the display to always be on, but there's potential to do better in real world scenarios where display is off a lot of the time.. The Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual is certainly one of those phones, with good standby time. The battery life is admirable even when the phone is connected to 3G/4G networks and functioning as a hotspot. As long as you are not constantly playing games and watching videos, you will be extremely happy with the battery life of the Xperia C5 Ultra Dual.. Verdict Overall, it's hard to find a much wrong with the Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual. It's amongst the best big screen phones we've come across. The phone was launched in India with a price tag of Rs. 29,990, though it is now available in the market for slightly less. If you are looking for a 6-inch phone, you have other options such as the Asus Zenfone 2 ZE601KL and the Gionee Elife E8 which can be seen as direct competitors to the Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual.. The Elife E8 is a flagship device, with more features and a higher price tag. The Zenfone 2 ZE601KL is more affordable than the Xperia C5 Ultra Dual, but it hasn't started shipping in India yet. Further, we haven't reviewed either of those phones yet, so it's difficult to comment on their relative merits and demerits as compared to the Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual. The Lenovo Phab Plus , which comes with a staggering 6.8-inch display, is another big screen device that's been announced for the Indian market.. There are some other old 6-inch devices still available in the market that you could consider, though none of them can be seen as directly competing with the Xperia C5 Ultra Dual, which is a fantastic phone with a lot to love if you don't mind its price tag..

Whenever a user is looking for a powerful device with stunning display, brilliant camera and top notch durability, the first brand that comes to the mind is Sony Xperia and rightfully so. The handset maker has bamboozled the world over with its C-series and Z series of smartphones. Now the brand has gone ahead and added yet another marvelous product to its lineup in form of Xperia C5 Ultra. Here is a brief overview of the handset for our readers.. The design of Sony handsets need no introduction and they happen to be one of prettiest looking handsets in the market. Sony Xperia C5 Ultra comes with the same sleek and attractive design that is the signature of the brand. The handset features a curved back and premium aluminium frame, that feels as good in hand as it looks. Moreover, the handset is just 8.2 mm thin, which makes it look extremely stylish.. The display of the handset is the talking point of the whole package as it comes with a massive 6-inch display that was found on the Xperia Z Ultra. The display on the handset look even bigger than it actually is, owing to the near invisible bezels on the sides. This display has been equipped with a full HD resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels, which offers a stunning visual experience on the massive display. Sony has also equipped the device with a Super Vivid Mode for the display that further enhances the overall visual experience.. Sony Xperia C5 Ultra offers a good user experience right out of the box since it comes with the latest Android 5.1 Lollipop operating system out of the box. Throw in the Xperia UI and the combination is one to swear by. Sony Xperia UI comes with a a large number of enhancements and improvements over stock Android user interface.. The performance of the handset is quite exemplary as it comes equipped with a powerful Octa-core processor that has been clocked at 1.7 GHz. Accompanying the processor is a RAM of 2GB that ensures there is ample memory for the device to multitask smoothly. The rear panel of the handset houses a 2930 mAh battery that can last a day's worth of usage.. Sony has always been known for its camera modules as well as imaging prowess and the brand has upped the quality by a notch in the C5 Ultra. The handset comes with a 13 MP primary camera on its rear panel, which is as good as it gets owing to the exemplary camera module and integrated features. The same camera also features on the front panel and offers Superior Auto and a wide-angle lens for stunning selfies. If the Xperia C4 was awarded the best selfie smartphone for year 2014, we believe that C5 Ultra will repeat the history in 2015.. Coming to the connectivity, the handset comes with support for 4G LTE and 3G connectivities, however, it is not confirmed yet whether it will support the Indian 4G bands or not. Other connectivity options on the handset include Bluetooth, DLNA, NFC, microUSB, GLONASS and GPS.. It is expected that the handset manufacturing brand will position the handset in sub-INR 25,000 price segment in India. The handset will be competing head on with OnePlus Two that has recently been launched in India with impressive features and fingerprint sensor. It will also face competition from the likes of Samsung Galaxy S5 and Oppo R5.. One fact that remains is that when all is said and done, the C5 Ultra happens to be one of the best looking handset in the market. Moreover, with 13 Megapixel snapper on the front as well as back and impressive features, this handset is expected to sell well in the country.. Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual Price in India. 23,900 .00.

Description for Sony Xperia C5 Ultra. How you look and what you see. With front and back cameras that are equally powerful, Xperia C5 Ultra Dual lets you share the full story – better than ever. Use the wide-angle front camera for more inclusive group shots. And snap sharper pics with Superior Auto and autofocus on both front and back. Now you can share the who, the where and the what you’re up to, in the clearest quality imaginable.. Our PROselfie camera, made even better. Our best dual SIM selfie phone yet delivers sharper than ever selfies on the first take. Superior Auto ensures you always get the perfect shot and our unique Selfie Flash lights up more of the picture, for clearer selfies day or night. Backlight isn’t a problem either thanks to HDR. We made it bigger without getting bigger. With Xperia C5 Ultra Dual, we’ve managed some smartphone magic. We’ve managed to maximise the display without adding bulk to your phone. With a wafer-thin bezel, Xperia C5 Ultra Dual is almost all screen. Together with a cool aluminium frame and an ever so slightly curved back, it’s a smartphone that feels as good as it looks.. When you’re too busy for two hands. Even if you love a big display, there are times – like when you’re chatting with a friend – when you want to use only one hand. With Xperia C5 Ultra Dual’s one-handed mode you get all the convenience of a compact phone, without giving up on the screen size you want.. Xperia C5 Ultra Dual’s maxed out Full HD display is perfect when you want to grab friends to share a laugh. The 6” screen makes room for everyone, and IPS technology means the view is clear from any angle. Just you and your favourite show? Thanks to the near-borderless display, with Sony’s BRAVIA TV technologies you’ll feel more involved than ever as the plot twists and turns.. Handle calls on both SIM cards. Dual SIM smartphones allow you to separate work and play and handle your calls more cost-efficiently. With our dual SIM feature you can talk on one SIM and still receive calls from the other, instead of going to voicemail. So you never need to miss a call again..

Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual launched in India: Review. If you love large display phones and taking selfies, Sony Xperia C5 Ultra dual should be at the forefront in your ‘My next smartphone’ list. The handset has familiar Xperia series Omni Balance design, with a slim (8.2 mm) profile and tips the scale at the 187 grams, which again lies on the heavier side of the spectrum, even for a 6 Inch display phone. Before you buy Sony Xperia C5 in India, here is our initial analysis. Talking about features and specifications, Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual includes a 6 Inch IPS LCD display with 1080p Full HD resolution, which means everything should be sharp and crisp no matter how closely you gawk at it. In spite of the large display size, Xperia C5 Ultra Dual is relatively compact, thanks to the narrow bezels on all sides (75.9 percent screen to body ratio). The handset employs MT6752 MediaTek octa core chipset clocked at 1.7GHz, and compared to other mid-range 64 bit chipset, we have had better experience with this one, especially for basic and moderate usage. The chipset is further assisted by 2GB RAM and 16GB storage, which can be further expanded by another 200GB using MicroSD card support. The standout feature of Sony Xperia C5 Ultra is of course the eye like 13MP selfie camera with autofocus (a rarity for front snappers), selfie flash, 22mm wide angle lens, image stabilization and ability to capture 1080p full HD videos. Needless to say, if you are interested in selfies, Sony has got you covered. The primary rear camera is similar to the front camera with the same 13MP Exmor RS sensor, 25 mm wide-angle lens and 1080p video recording. Other notable features include 4G LTE / 3G HSPA+, WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n , Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC, Sony 3D Surround Sound technology, ClearAudio+, GLONASS and GPS. The 2930 mAh battery should last for one day of moderate usage. Sony Xperia C5 Ultra looks like a decent alternative for moderate and basic users. If you need to indulge in aggressive gaming or are a heavy user, there are better options like OnePlus 2 available in the same price bracket. Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual price online is approximately 26K at the time of writing.. 13MP Selfie Shooter Large 6 Inch Full HD Display Slim profile Up to 200GB MicroSD storage support Scratch Resistant Glass. The Xperia C5 Ultra is certainly big but it's just 6mm taller and 2mm wider than the latest 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus. And for those few extra mm you're getting half an inch of extra screen. The hardware in the Xperia C5 Ultra as is capable as most other midrange rival priced and does better than most Snapdragon-615-powered alternatives. The impressive selfie sensor is quite a bonus if you have a use for it.. Also available with dual SIM support Android 5.0 Lollipop with Xperia UI 16GB of built-in storage, expandable via a microSD card slot for up to 200GB Active noise cancellation with a secondary microphone 2,930mAh battery; power-saving STAMINA Mode. Glossy finish on a plastic back isn't particularly subtle, especially at this size Wi-Fi lacks a/c support Non-removable battery. Sony is better then all other brand. Screen 6 inch 13 mp rear and front selfi Bettery is good sharp screen No hanging problem at all No phon is near of c5 Video clearly awesome Head phone sound and phone sound awesome Top class phone. Price is still 25 k almost from 2 year... Heating Problem Hanging Problem Battery Discharge Very quickly. If you are thinking to buy Xperia C5 Ultra then go for it. No other phone can compare it's front camera. Because of big screen typing is very easy and has one hand mode also. Keyboard is also adjustable according to owner. Battery can be made more powerful by Sony but it is fine. If I charge it to 100 % then last for a complete day with normal uses of phone. Qnd even because of big screen and great camera people notices you and another reason is the brand tagged symbol "Sony". Great display,great camera great looks,great CPU. Display is very powerful and speakers,OMG, awesome. A lot of features and is upgradable to latest android version. Battery gets down a bit earlier may be because of big screen. Heating problem Battery Discharge fast Touch is Slow. Heating Problem when using 15 mint Continue Battery Discharge very Quickly Touch very Slow In sab Ke Hisaab Se Price Bhut Jayada Hai....

The Sony Xperia C5 Ultra has a slightly unusual camera setup, in that both the rear and front-facing snappers are 13 megapixel. That’s a fairly high spec for a rear camera and a very high one for a front-facing one, so you’ll be able to take sharp, detailed selfies with the phone.nnThere are of course a number of camera modes and features too, such as Superior Auto mode, which will pick the best scene mode for any situation and SteadyShot to keep your videos shake-free.nnThe front-facing camera meanwhile has a 22mm wide-angle lens, so you can fit big groups in a single shot and with a soft LED flash photos will look as flattering as possible..
