HTC One X10 - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ». I have to buy a new phone and I'm thinking between this HTC one x10 and Asus Zenfone 3 ... more one x 10 is batter option. I have to buy a new phone and I'm thinking between this HTC one x10 and Asus Zenfone 3 max 32GB/3GB ZC553KL. Seems like HTC discontinued the phone. bought this in Australia for A$350 (where flagship phones cost A$1000-1500+) and i think it's fantastic. battery life ifs the best on any phone i've had. i get a full day use with heavy gaming etc, then charge overnight. the cpu is not a flagship killer - but cpu hasn't been an issue for me for the last few phone generations. its cpu still does as good or better than comparable mid-range phones (around A$500 price) and it's energy-efficient which adds to battery life. i'm a photographer with a Canon 5D as my main rig, and yet the camera on the HTC is surprisingly good. the 'pro' mode on the stock HTC camera app is better than any open manual camera apps i've tried before. the manual sliders let me focus incredibly up-close macros, and the exposure and white balance sliders let me capture a perfect sunset - the touch UI is easier than on my Canon tbh. and the HTC's all-metal body looks and feels like a premium phone. i just wish it had usb C, like my last Nexus. bought this phone two weeks ago in Australia. very fast and excellent battery life. Reception when making calls is also very good. phone was released in 2017 but with outdated Android Marshmallow. Admittedly, it works really fast and smooth.. i am regular DUal sim user. Every thing is going fine yet, one drawback want to write about is, it has either dual sim option or you can use memory card. you cannot use sim2 and Memoray card together ( Both have same slot and they wrote EITHER SIM2 or SD.. SYED, 13 Nov 2017 Finally, I purchased yesterday HTC one x10... sound and display quality Is good but I was not... more You used these cell phone. Do Desire 828 or desire 830 has compass?. Failed on the first firmware update. Had to go off for repairs. No response from HTC when I asked for money back...still waiting. This is the second htc phone to do this to me and I'm not buying any more.... Son Start, 08 Jan 2018 What is your idea if you want to buy from these models : Zenfone 4 Max ZC554KL or HTC One X10 ... more Go for the Asus Max coz it has better SD430 SoC compared to others.. What is your idea if you want to buy from these models : Zenfone 4 Max ZC554KL or HTC One X10 and Galaxy A5 2017. I heard some news about the problem in Camera and quality of these phone.. This is the best value smart phone I have seen. Slightly less resolution than the main opposition, everything else is comparable or better. Cameras, RAM, memory (extend with card), processor, battery life ... At $349 from Dick Smith online, how can you beat it. Is this phone hybrid sim model???pls tell me.... SYED, 13 Nov 2017 Finally, I purchased yesterday HTC one x10... sound and display quality Is good but I was not... more Check out the camera settings.. I believe Huawei and Sumsang more reliable then HTC or don't. Huawei Y 7 Prime or Sumsang J7 pro are awesome.. Anonymous, 03 Oct 2017 I am very confusing between Snapdragon 617 and Helio P10. Which one is more faster? Pls tell m... more Never ever go for MediaTek. anybody can tell me the OS IS which version android 4 5 6 or 7. Finally, I purchased yesterday HTC one x10... sound and display quality Is good but I was not satisfied with the camera.. last time I purchased two mobiles of htc's. htc desire 830 and HTC desire 828 .compared to HTC one x10.. Htc desire 830/828 is a good camera.. if you want a good camera, please don't buy htc one x10.. in low range HTC Desire 830 Have a good camera.

HTC One X10 is official with 4,000mAh battery and metal body. Coming to Russia for the equivalent of $355.. HTC has announced the latest in its mid-tier "One X" family, the HTC One X10. Drawing from both old and new HTC design elements, the X10 packs a 5.5-inch 1080p display into a metal body, with an enormous 4,000mAh battery which the company claims can deliver up to two-day longevity.. Style-wise, it's reminiscent of the old "One M" series phones, with the addition of a fingerprint scanner around the back, while the front looks more like an HTC 10 with its fingerprint sensor lopped off.. On the inside, it's powered by a MediaTek Helio P10 processor, with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, plus microSD. There's also dual SIM support, with both slots supporting 4G LTE. You've also got a pretty run-of-the-mill camera setup, with a 16-megapixel sensor on the back, behind an f/2.0 lens, and an 8-megapixel f/2.2 selfie camera.. HTC's Sense software is running the show, along with its Boost+ feature, that's supposed to help speed up performance. HTC neglects to mention which version of Android this is though, which is cause for concern because the company is shipping MediaTek-based phones elsewhere still running the ancient 6.0 Marshmallow. (The HTC U Play, for example.). The HTC One X10 will go on sale in Russia later this month in black and silver color options, priced at 19,990 rubles ($355).. There's no word on any release outside of Russia just yet, nor is this is the kind of phone that's likely to see a widespread Western launch. In any case, my main takeaway is this: If HTC can cram such a large battery into a phone of this size, what was it thinking when it stuck the larger, flagship-tier U Ultra with a cell 25% smaller?.

Tech deals, prizes and latest news. The HTC One X10 is coming. A new line Via AndroidCentral. Rumors for the HTC 11 – also may be known as the HTC Ocean – are thin on the ground at the moment, but a new phone from the Taiwanese company has surfaced and it's called the HTC One X10.. The phone originally leaked thanks to Twitter leaker Evleaks, but now appears to be official.. The One X10 stands out with a 4,000mAh battery and boasts a full-metal design, but oddly enough, it only appears to be showing up on the Russian HTC website. It's possible that this phone won't release outside of RU, but fingers are crossed.. As we saw in the leak and now, the official page, the phone has a single-lens on the rear with an LED flash to the side of it. Underneath, you'll find a fingerprint sensor, a placement HTC hasn't used since the HTC One Max in 2013, and flanking it on the right hand side of the device is a button to turn the screen on and a volume rocker sat just above.. Regarding some other specs, it features a Full HD 5.5-inch display, 3GB of RAM and a 16MP rear sensor, 8MP front sensor, as well as running on the MediaTek Helio P10 octa-core chipset.. A price isn't clear at the moment, but the specs suggests it's a mid-range phone so will hopefully be cheaper than the very expensive HTC U Ultra if it ever arrives outside of Russia..

Mobiles / HTC Mobile Phones / HTC One X10 Price in India. User Visits: 258 Compare. The Taiwanese handset maker, HTC has been long overdue to launch a successor to the X9 and is all set to launch X10 in coming days. This mid-ranger from the brand is expected to come with a spec-sheet, which is typical mid-range and will go up against Xiaomi and Motorola to name a few. Here is a quick overview of the device for those who might be interested in the HTC One X10.. Impressive cameras : HTC has always highlighted the imaging prowess of its handsets as one of the mainstay and it has been true for most of its handsets. The HTC One X10 will also be equipped with top of the line 16MP snapper on the rear panel, loaded with HTC features. On the front panel is an 8MP shooter, which is ideal for clicking selfies. Moreover, the brand is also known for its low-light imaging prowess, which is a plus. Good battery : It is being speculated that the handset will come with a good 3,000mAh battery, which can push the usage to a day. Moreover, the handset comes with Quick Charging feature, which means it would not take much to go up to 100 from zero when charging. Also, HTC has one of the best battery saving feature integrated in the OS, which helps in pushing the device a little further if running on low battery. Crisp display : The HTC X10 comes with a decently sized 5.5-inch display on the front, which makes it a good option for multimedia and gaming lovers. HTC has blessed the display with a resolution of 1080p, which means not only it is easy on eyes but also on the battery.. No NFC : It is a deal breaker for many to get a mid-range smartphone in the market and to not have basic features. While the HTC One X10 does get a lot of good features out of the box, it is missing out on NFC. While this is not much of a deal breaker, It does change the dynamics when you take the futuristic features like Google Pay and others into consideration.. 22,990 (Expected Price) HTC One X10 is currently not available in any online store..

There had been an unofficial port available for months, but it wasn’t until last week that an official build was released. The unofficial port was version 3.1.1 of TWRP, but this official release brings it up to version 3.2 .1 and simply needs to be flashed via the fastboot flash recovery command. If you already have this unofficial version of TWRP installed, then you can simply update it from within this older version. You’ll find the download page for this TWRP build here while the source code has been made public here .. Want more posts like this delivered to your inbox?
