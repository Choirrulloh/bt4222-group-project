Sturdy glass makes up the phone's exterior, and you can select from gold, silver, or gray designs. Choose a phone with enough storage for your needs, such as a roomy 64GB option or a spacious 256GB phone. The oversized smartphone weighs 7.13 ounces. The iPhone's Multi-Touch display is intuitive and immersive, and as with previous phones, this iPhone has Touch ID built in. Equipped with a high-performance A11 processor, it's the fastest iPhone yet.. The iPhone 8 price reflects its multitude of features. Not only is the mobile phone beautiful and durable, but it's also dust and water-resistant. One of the coolest perks of the phone that it's compatible with wireless charging, so you can simply use a charging mat to power it efficiently and quickly. In the next year, Apple will release its own charging mat that will be compatible with the Apple Watch , too. This phone includes technology other phones don't, and gaming fans will enjoy the ability to play augmented reality games and apps with an enhanced platform.. Shutterbugs rejoice! The new iPhone has an improved camera guaranteed to please shooters of all skill levels. Take 12MP photos with the aid of a sophisticated six-element lens and speedy sensor. Added filters enhance colors and pixels, creating clear, vibrant images. Photos are never shaky thanks to the camera's optical image stabilization feature, and the iPhone offers up even more ways to snap stunning portraits with portrait modes and lighting meant to recreate the look of a studio shot.

CNET también está disponible en español.. iPhone 8 Plus hands-on: Will some prefer it to the iPhone X?. It's larger than the X and lacks some of its features, but it may have most of what people want.. by September 19, 2017 7:34 AM PDT. iPhone 8 and 8 Plus in photos: More glass, more durable. iPhone 8 and 8 Plus: Early first look. Update: Check out our full iPhone 8 review and iPhone 8 Plus review .. There are three new iPhones coming this fall, and Apple's range of iPhone models seems to be ever-expanding. The showcase flagship, the iPhone X , arrives in November. Meanwhile, the new iPhone 8 and 8 Plus have upgrades in camera, processor and add wireless charging, and arrive Sept. And, maybe, for some people, that's more than enough.. I tried the 8 Plus briefly after the announcement at Apple Park. In one sense, it feels similar to last year's iPhone 7 Plus. But it's also the only 8 model to have dual rear cameras (the smaller iPhone 8 lacks them, still). That means it can do Portrait Mode, as well as take advantage of new Portrait Lighting camera effects for a range of other photo features.. The new glass back gives it a glossier finish but similar design to the 7 Plus.. The glass back is very shiny, and adds a glossy feel to the phone finish. How the new iPhone glass backs fare when dropped is still an unknown. But it does enable wireless Qi-compatible charging with existing accessories on the market, which is a big plus.. A new A11 Bionic processor promises to be better optimized for AR, too, and faster than last year's A10. All three new iPhones have the A11, meaning they should all fare equally well at new ARKit apps. In that sense, the 8 Plus may very well be just as a good a choice as the iPhone X .. Except, its rear dual cameras lack one thing the iPhone X has: better telephoto. While the 12MP wide-angle camera has optical image stabilization like last year, the f/2.8 telephoto closer-range camera on the iPhone 8 Plus still lacks optical image stabilization. Meanwhile, the iPhone X telephoto is f/2.4 and has OIS, which could make a significant difference in certain conditions. We haven't done comparative testing yet: I only got to see these briefly in a demo room.. iPhone 8 debuts with wireless charging. The X adds a more compact design with a larger screen, as well as a better front-facing camera that adds more effects, facial controls, front-facing Portrait Mode selfies and Face ID facial unlocking. But it drops the home button and Touch ID. The new interface and unlocking method may not yet be your cup of tea. In that case, the iPhone 8 Plus might be the best bet.. And, for some apps, the 8 Plus might still feel like the biggest screen option. The iPhone X has a screen cut-out near the camera, and it's unclear how that will feel across existing apps. The 8 Plus is a safer bet, but also seems like the go-to choice for a would-be iPhone 8 shopper who doesn't want to wait. For practical phone features, such as battery, camera, performance and price, this might be the model to beat.. iPhone X: No home button, OLED screen, wireless charging. Apple TV 4K: New $179 Apple streamer adds HDR, better gaming. It'll be available in 64GB and 256GB models, with prices starting at $799, £799 or AU$1,229. The iPhone 8 Plus' all-new glass design is reinforced by steel. The front and backs are made of glass and have steel trimming around the edge. The phones will be available in silver, space gray and gold. The iPhone 8 Plus camera boasts new chips and sensors which should help across the board, with faster autofocus and better low light performance. The speakers are also purportedly 27 percent louder than the. iPhone 7 ( $679.99 at Amazon.com ) , with deeper bass.. iPhone 8 and iPhone X unveiled: Pictures, photos from the Apple event.

Apple iPhone 8 Plus (64GB, Gold). Apple iPhone 8 Plus (64GB, Silver). Apple iPhone 8 Plus (256GB, Gold). Apple iPhone 8 Plus (256GB, Silver). CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good Fantastic dual-lens camera shoots better than ever with improved portrait mode. Best battery life in current iPhone line.. The Bad Dated design. Lacks some of the extra iPhone X camera features. Large body makes it hard to hold.. The Bottom Line The iPhone 8 Plus is a great phone with a spectacular camera that offers a lot of what iPhone X has under the hood, but in a lot less exciting body.. Design: Once again (mostly) the same Camera: Stellar shots, even better video. The 8 Plus isn't "the best iPhone you can buy," as the larger Plus phones have been since Apple started its. "regular and extra large" iPhone releases in 2014. And it's no longer the only big-screen iPhone. The iPhone X is a step above the 8 Plus in a lot of ways, with some extra camera features, a great size-to-body ratio, a vivid OLED display, and a surprisingly functional Face ID camera that replaces the home button. Of course, it's also more expensive.. But, don't sleep on the 8 Plus. The 8 Plus feels a lot bigger than the compact X, and its design has barely changed from previous iPhone Plus models. But its powerful performance, still-excellent cameras, and roomy, standard-shaped screen -- which maximizes all existing iPhone apps and includes a few iPad-like features not available on the X -- makes it the old-school, "get it done" veteran of Apple's iPhone lineup.. Wireless charging: Qi for now, Apple's own AirPower in 2018.. This big, capable phone includes all of the features of the smaller iPhone 8 ( $799.99 at Best Buy ) -- including wireless charging, the True Tone screen and that same superfast A11 Bionic processor you'll find in the X. But, like last year's iPhone 7 Plus ( $891.02 at Amazon.com ) , you get a larger 5.5-inch screen, water resistance and -- most critically -- an excellent dual rear camera with 2x optical zoom, upgraded for 2017 with an all-new image sensor. That camera, already great a year ago, has gotten even more refined and fantastic-looking. In the weeks since the 8 Plus release, it's impressed both CNET Senior Photographer James Martin and me. And while the camera on the iPhone X is a bit better, the difference is more one of inches than miles, as Lexy Savvides and Vanessa Hand Orellana found in their deep-dive comparison .. While the upgrades for existing 7 Plus owners are minimal (beyond wireless charging), the 8 Plus is worth the premium over the 8 to get the dual cameras, larger display, and a battery life that still beats out the iPhone X. It feels like a large workhorse next to the iPhone X, a traditional phone... And, perhaps, one that some will prefer over the X.. Dual cameras: Mostly the same on the outside, better processing inside.. Now that I've lived with both phones for weeks, I prefer the more hand-friendly iPhone X. But I think the 8 Plus is still a fantastic package, and a great chance to get onboard with Apple's newest processors without making the full move (financially and ergonomically) to Apple's new iPhone designs.. 22: This review has been updated to add a battery rating, and a discussion of how battery life compares across 2017 iPhones. A November 16 update added extensive comparisons of the iPhone 8 Plus and the iPhone X, as well as photo comparisons to the Pixel 2.. The iPhone 8 (left) and iPhone 8 Plus (right) flanking the iPhone X (center).. To reiterate: The iPhone 8 Plus has all of the same basic features as the new iPhone 8, except for its larger size, slightly better battery life (in our everyday real-life use) and better cameras. If you want a deeper dive into those main new details of the 2017 iPhones, check out our iPhone 8 review .. Best iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus cases. As far as the Plus design goes, it's deja vu all over again. The iPhone 8 Plus looks identical to the 7 Plus, but it does feel different, thanks to a move to a glossy glass back. Apple's construction process this time uses stronger aluminum body accents, steel reinforcement inside and metal highlights around the camera lens. There are only three colors this time: white with silver highlights, glossy black and space gray, and a blush pink-like gold that feels rose-goldish.. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 ( $900.00 at Amazon.com ). The new Pixel 2 is a great camera. Apple used to have an untouchable lead in camera quality, but now many phones take excellent photos. And that's why Apple has once again raised the bar on its camera.. Portrait Lighting is a new mode that adds simulated lighting effects. The 8 Plus includes a new sensor and image signal processor to go with its new A11 Bionic chip, promising richer colors, better low-light shots and faster autofocus. My photos generally turned out great. Low-light gains aren't as dramatic as I expected compared to the already excellent iPhone 7 Plus, but the photos I've been taking have generally looked phenomenal.. Portrait Mode, which debuted last year, now supports flash photography and HDR (on the 7 Plus, too, with iOS 11 ). The 8 Plus and the X add a new photo technique called Portrait Lighting, a beta feature that adds simulated 3D lighting to faces and even strips out backgrounds to create a studio-shot effect. My mileage varied: Sometimes the effect was stunning, but other times it looked very fake and weirdly clipped. I wouldn't upgrade my phone for it, but it can be fun to toy with. Stage Light Mono effect in Portrait Mode. Originally this was an office background.. At sunset around my home, comparison shots between the 7 Plus and 8 Plus weren't that easy to tell apart until it was nearly dark. The new slow-syncing flash that promises richer flash photos didn't have a huge impact for me so far, but I need to keep trying it out. But see for yourself: the camera takes damn good photos, and colors do seem enhanced. That can also mean more details. HDR was improved when shooting sun-drenched clouds.. How the iPhone 8 Plus sees San Francisco. As I mentioned, James Martin used the Plus, too , and as a professional photographer is maybe even more impressed than I am. Instead of new lenses or a really different hardware camera, the software and processing inside are making the photos better. He was impressed by the low noise in low-light photos, the color rendering and the texture representation.. As opposed to traditional camera companies -- the Nikons, Canons and Fujis of the world -- he sees Apple's advances in applying the iPhone's powerful CPU to the photo process to be the most stunning concepts at play. "Apple is doing things in computational photography that the traditional companies have neglected," he says.. Portrait Mode feels a lot more refined.. Video looks fantastic, and the switch to new photo and video formats enables 4K video recording at 60 frames per second, or slow-motion in 1080p and 240 frames per second. That said, while the 8 Plus excelled in low-light video capture, CNET's Lexy Savvides found that the single lens of the Pixel 2 nudged past it on certain tasks when she compared them head to head .. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News. Homeland Security's tall order: A hacker-free election. 'Annihilation' director wove memory into a dream-like movie.

Just like the iPhone 8, the iPhone 8 Plus sticks to a familiar form factor, with water resistance and built-in stereo speakers, but replaces the metal housing with a glass back to enable wireless charging. It brings along a new, faster Apple A11 Bionic system chip and a display supporting Apple's True Tone display technology. The dual camera at the back now shoots 4K video at up to 60fps and takes portraits with studio lighting effects. The addition of optical image stabilization to the 2X zoom Telephoto camera should translate to clearer images and portraits. iOS 11 runs on it out of the box, introducing augmented reality applications, a redesigned App Store, a new Control Center layout, and a number of UI refinements..

Still a relatively low-res screen with a big bezel for the price.. The iPhone 8 Plus may promise better augmented reality experiences than its smaller counterpart thanks to its dual cameras, making it the one you should buy.. The iPhone 8 Plus — really the iPhone 7s Plus, when you think about it — may be the sweet spot in Apple's new phone lineup. Its dual cameras will enable better augmented reality experiences than the iPhone 8 , and its bigger screen offers a better spotlight for high-intensity applications powered by the new A11 processor. And, starting at $799 (for 64GB), it's significantly less expensive than the iPhone X. While we wish Apple had been more innovative with its screen and modem here, the 8 Plus is our Editors' Choice for iPhones right now.. From the front, you may have some trouble telling the iPhone 8 Plus apart from the 7 Plus. At 6.24 by 3.07 by 0.3 inches and 7.13 ounces, it's the same size, but heavier. It has a similar 5.5-inch, 1,920-by-1,080 LCD, although it's been enhanced with True Tone, which gives it better white balance in different kinds of lighting. The Touch ID home button sits below the screen, as usual. There's a Lightning port, but no headphone jack, and the phone is water-resistant.. Flip over the 8 Plus to see the difference from last year's model. The phone now has a glass back, rather than smooth metal. It also supports wireless charging with all the popular Qi-compatible chargers. We put it on both Mophie and Samsung wireless charging pads and it charged just fine, if slowly, at about two-thirds of the speed of standard wired charging. Apple says a firmware update will enable faster wireless charging in the future.. View All 17 Photos in Gallery. The A11 Bionic processor has six cores, two of which are "high performance" and four of which are "efficiency" cores. That's more than the four-core A10 and the two-core A9, but the whole core thing is a red herring; it's possible to design a fast processor with few cores, or many cores.. What makes it Bionic? Well, bionics is the science of combining biological and electronic parts and methods, so I think it's referring to the new Neural Engine. The Neural Engine is a custom block of the A11 dedicated to machine learning. On the iPhone 8 Plus, it doesn't do much yet, although it's involved in scene recognition in the camera app. But iOS 11 includes an API called CoreML that helps third-party developers integrate machine learning into their own apps—recognizing types of food or clothing when they train the camera on them, for instance.. The iPhone 8 and the 8 Plus have the same processor, although the 8 has 2GB of RAM and the 8 Plus has 3GB. That resulted in very similar benchmarks for the two phones. They're both the fastest phones we've ever tested, benchmark-wise, and in the same class as the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro .. On the iPhone 8 Plus, we got about 214k on the Antutu benchmark, 4,255 on Geekbench single-core, and 10,298 on Geekbench multi-core. The iPhone 7 managed 165k, 3,500, and 6,024, respectively. The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 hit 175k, 1,870, and 6,500.. For graphics, the iPhone 8 Plus' 65,011 scored on the 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited benchmark is nearly double that of the iPhone 7's 37,825. But wait! This is one area where Apple's steadfast refusal to improve its screen resolution does it no good. Last year's iPhones hit the 60 frame-per-second sync limit on the GFXBench graphics benchmarks, and this one does too. This iPhone's GPU is powerful enough to drive Apple's "ProMotion" 120Hz tablet screen; I just wish the phone had one.. See How We Test Cell Phones. For a real-world application, we recorded a 2-minute, 4K video, applied a filter in iMovie, and exported it to 720p. The iPhone 8 managed the export in 24 seconds compared with the iPhone 7's 31 seconds. That's a noticeable difference, but we couldn't find other apps where the difference between 7 and 8 performance was easily visible; iOS apps are just too well-architected for a range of phones.. The iPhone 7 is already quite fast in current applications, including the simple early ARKit apps. The open question is whether all of this neural and graphics power will make the iPhone 8 Plus more effective in future AR experiences.. We also took an in-depth look at the iPhone 8 Plus' modem performance and, as the chart below shows, it does better than the 7 Plus and the 6s Plus on all four major US networks. But Apple could have done better. This year's iPhones lack the gigabit LTE speeds currently being used by Bell and Telus in Canada, and which will come from AT&T and T-Mobile next year in the US. They lack 4x4 MIMO, which helps in weak-signal areas and with recovery from dead zones, and which the Samsung Galaxy S8 has. They also lack T-Mobile's coverage-extending Band 71, which is so far only on the LG V30 .. For Wi-Fi, we got slightly better performance on the iPhone 8 Plus than on the 7 Plus, but not so much that anyone would notice. The phone supports 802.11ac on the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, just like the iPhone 7 series.. Apple says the iPhone 8 Plus has roughly the same battery life as the 7 Plus. We got 5 hours, 13 minutes of video playback time over LTE, which is shorter than the 6 hours we got with the iPhone 7 Plus. However, the phone should fast-charge with high-wattage chargers, Apple says, all the way up to a MacBook charger. Using an iPad charger, for instance, nearly doubled charging speed—so if you're buying a new iPhone, a $19 iPad charger is a great investment.. Also, when you're thinking of iPhone battery life results, remember two things. First, you probably won't use your phone on full brightness (which will extend usable life). Second, iPhones leak battery in the background less than Android phones do. You won't be surprised by a dead battery if you pick up your 8 Plus after not having used or charged it overnight.. The 8 Plus has dual 12-megapixel cameras: a regular one, with f/1.8 aperture, and a 2x telephoto one, with f/2.8. There's also a 7-megapixel front-facing camera with f/2.2 aperture, the exact same one as on the iPhone 7 Plus. The telephoto lens is not optically stabilized, unlike on the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and the iPhone X. For now, the dual cameras are mostly about 2x zoom photography and bokeh, for selective-focus portrait mode like on the iPhone 7 Plus.. Our camera analyst, Jim Fisher, did an in-depth study looking at the difference between the iPhone 8 Plus and competing cameras, including the iPhone 8, the iPhone 7 Plus, and the Galaxy Note 8.. In the lab, the Note 8 shows a bit more color saturation in good light, and a bit less noise in low light. The Note 8's 2x lens is a bit sharper than the iPhone's in good light, but drops out of the race in low light. The 8 Plus does especially well in outdoor night scenes, balancing reflections off of street signs with darker areas.. Compared with the iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone 8 Plus isn't much of an improvement. Now, the 7 Plus is already very, very good — that's sort of the point here. But Apple is marketing the 8 Plus as having significant camera advances, and we just didn't see them. You have to go back to the Galaxy S7 generation, or the iPhone 6, to see a major jump in quality with the iPhone 8 Plus.. The iPhone 8 Plus can also do Portrait Lighting, a filter that makes people look silhouetted on a dark background. I'm not a fan, but the feature already appears to be widely popular (then again, so are Snapchat filters that make you look like a dog). If you want this feature, you need to get a Plus or an X, not the smaller iPhone 8.. Portrait mode is still clearly in beta, however. When we photographed one of our staffers outdoors, the iPhone's portrait and bokeh algorithms got thrown off by stray hairs in a way that didn't happen with the Note 8. This is something that can be fixed in software, and we're pretty sure that Apple will do so. With other subjects, such as food and flowers, the iPhone 8 Plus delivered better background blur using its dual lenses.. Two new features have come aboard for video: the phone can now record 4K video at 60 frames per second, and slow-motion 1080p video at 240fps. With 24, 30 and 60fps options for 4K video, the iPhone 8 Plus outpaces its Android competition (and older iPhones) in giving videographers a range of viewing styles.. But if you're a serious iPhone videographer, you may want to wait for the X. The 8 Plus' 2x lens is not optically stabilized, which means motion isn't as smooth when you're taking videos as it would be on the iPhone X or the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.. Apple is going big on augmented reality in the next few years. That's why we're uncomfortable telling iPhone buyers to purchase a model that lacks dual cameras. While Apple's ARKit can do augmented reality with a single camera, it's clearly limited. Demos we've seen show ARKit only able to map horizontal surfaces like tables and floors, not walls or whole rooms.. This is where we get into pure speculation. Apple swears up and down that the Plus' second camera gives it absolutely no advantage over a single-camera device for AR. But all of my experience with AR says otherwise: that second camera, in the future, could provide enhanced AR capabilities, such as the ability to detect vertical surfaces (in other words, walls).. The iPhone 8 Plus, like every iPhone Apple currently sells, runs iOS 11. We have a full iOS 11 review that goes into the new features in-depth. There's one area where we suspect the 8 Plus and 7 Plus will outpace other iPhones, though, and it's a major focus for Apple: augmented reality.. If you're deciding between an iPhone and an Android phone, on the other hand, there are a few areas where Apple and Google differ, although the two OSes are broadly similar in capabilities nowadays. We'd focus on Messages, the AR/VR split, services, and privacy.. If you have a lot of friends with iPhones, and you live in the US, Messages could help make your decision for you. Messages is the iPhone's default texting app (formerly iMessage), and it has much richer group messaging, presence, and stickers than SMS does. Later this year, it'll also get Venmo -like abilities to send money between iPhone owners. In countries where everybody uses Whatsapp or WeChat, this isn't such a big deal. But in the US, where default texting apps dominate, Messages tends to build iPhone-only social groups that can leave Android users out of the loop. If at least several of your other friends have Android phones, though, it won't have the critical mass to matter so much.. Apple is going big on augmented reality where Android is stronger on virtual reality. AR is about placing virtual objects in the real world; VR is about strapping on a headset and shooing the real world away. So far, there's no VR solution for iPhones, and Google is several months behind Apple on AR. I think AR has a broader appeal, because VR headsets tend to get sweaty and a little claustrophobic.. If you're interested in AR, I'd say go with the 8 Plus rather than the regular iPhone 8. And go with the 8 Plus rather than the 7 Plus. Not only do I suspect that dual cameras will offer a better AR experience in the future, a bigger screen gives you a better window into an augmented world, and the new A11 processor is specifically tuned for AR apps. It's safe to say this will be the best AR phone until we see the iPhone X.. If you aren't focused on AR or Messages, your decision may come down to whether you prefer Apple's services or Google's. Each company's music, mail, photo and cloud services work best on their own OS. Apple really wants you to use Apple Music, for example; if you ask Siri to play music, she'll try to do it through Apple Music. Similarly, iCloud is baked more deeply into the OS than other cloud services. The Gmail experience on iOS is okay, but it's better on Android. Finally, Apple is stronger on privacy than Google is. Google's business is data, and you should assume it's collecting data on everything you do. Apple's business is primarily hardware, and it's less likely to share your data with others.. The iPhone 8 Plus is ready for the future, which makes it our favorite iPhone so far — but then again, we haven't tested the iPhone X yet.. At $799 for 64GB and $949 for 256GB, the 8 Plus is less expensive than its primary competitor, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Like we saw with the iPhone 7 Plus, the second camera brings real value to the 8 Plus, and that's one of the reasons we recommend it over the iPhone 8. But in this generation, with Apple's new focus on augmented reality, we also think big screens are the way to go. A bigger-screen phone makes augmented reality applications easier to view and manipulate.. The wild card here is the upcoming iPhone X. The X is going to share a lot in common with the 8 Plus. They have the same processor and roughly the same cameras, although the X has image stabilization on the second, zoom camera that might improve low-light performance. And the X's sleeker design is going to fit better in the hand than the 8 Plus does, which could make it the best of both worlds: the big-screen, dual-camera power of the 8 Plus, without the 2014-era giant bezels.. What about iPhone or Android? It's really a matter of ecosystem. The 8 Plus has a better processor than leading Android competitors such as the Galaxy Note 8 and LG V30. The cameras just about match, while the 8 Plus' screen and LTE connectivity aren't quite as good. Ultimately, the iPhone's strength isn't in the specs. It's in the community and support — the ability to join group Messages chats with other iPhone users, to get things fixed quickly at a Genius Bar, and to be the first to see cutting-edge, gorgeously designed new augmented reality games.. We're recommending three iPhones right now: the low-cost iPhone SE, which needs a processor update but is the best price-performance value; the iPhone 7, which at $549 gets you a modern, AR-ready phone with a stellar camera for a reasonable price; and the 8 Plus, at $799. Those make a terrific good-better-best lineup for Apple fans, until the X arrives.. I'm not one to draw conclusions before actually reviewing a phone, so I look forward to checking out the iPhone X and editing this section based on my experiences. But for now, the 64GB iPhone 8 Plus is our favorite premium iPhone, and our Editors' Choice.. Bottom Line: The iPhone 8 Plus may promise better augmented reality experiences than its smaller counterpart thanks to its dual cameras, making it the one you should buy..

TechnoMaster sent me a great iPhone 8plus, new and crossed many thousands of international roads but got me the product unlike that dung pile KWIRELESS, heathens. I’ve never owned anything this nice in my life like the iPhone 8 Plus. You can play for days on end with the camera and have the same photo technology as professionals. The camera in the phone working along with an app for tilt and shift produces like 😵. Everything on the case is glass. I can’t dream of a drop and looking for a good case.. Was this review helpful to you?. #1 HALL OF FAME TOP 10 REVIEWER. 5.0 out of 5 stars Powerful and fast smart phone and we like ours!. Color: Gold | Size: 256 GB. I just traded in my iPhone 7 Plus for a new iPhone 8 Plus and I love it. The new glass case is beautiful. I also like the display as it is crisper and the color is perfect on the screen. I purchased a gold phone for my wife and a silver phone for myself. Don’t believe other comments you might see because I officially rate and run speed tests on my phones. The gold phone, we purchased, is rated the fastest phone smart phone in the world at this time. It’s Antutu rating is 219575 and the second silver phone is rated at 216318. This phone just blows away my iPhone 7 Plus with speed and downloading apps and animation quality. My old iPhone 7 Plus was rated at 178438. This speed is due to the new A11 Bionic chip with 64 bit architecture. This phone has the new bluetooth 5 which succeeds bluetooth 4.2. Bluetooth 5 is backward compatible to the previous versions. The new bluetooth has twice the speed of the 4.2 version and about 4 times the range. That is amazing since it uses less power and its message capacity is 255 bytes versus 31 bytes which makes the data payload of the 4.2 version rated at 20 bytes max. This is a major distance and data transmission increase in performance. I notice it when I lay down my phone and walk away and my Apple Watch 3 is still connected when before I would lose connection with my older iPhone. The phone is designed to be IP67 for splash, water and dust resistant. The camera is still 12 MP but it has excellent performance with optical zoom and digital zoom up to 10 times. It also still has the portrait camera mode with the blurred background Bokeh effect by using both of the rear cameras. It even uses the new portrait lighting mode to make your photos look more professional. In the video recording mode I really like the 4K video recording with 30 or 60 fps. Of course you still have the front facing camera with 7MP quality for face time or selfie photography. The slow motion mode is nice when shooting sports events or shooting wildlife videos. The phone is slightly larger but is still fits into most of your iPhone 7 Plus cases. The new iPhone 8 Plus weighs just a bit more at 7.12 ounces versus 6.63 ounces. The battery life is the same in the specs but for me it seems to be a bit longer at 22.4 hours. The new phone is only available in 64 GIG or 256 GIG storage capacity. Overall this is a great phone. I am happy with our new phones and it is a good upgrade in power and performance.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Was stoken!. Color: Gold | Size: 64 GB | Verified Purchase.

Honestly the people saying there’s no green and that it’s more grey are wrong, this case does have a bit of grey in the right light but it is undeniably green, and an awesome green to add to that.

I checked online and even tried it in the store to see what it would look like and liked it enough to spend $40 on it. But over time it started to look grey and I thought it was just me but other people agreed. As much as I love the color it originally appeared to be, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're cool with a dark grey looking color over time. 1 of 1 people found this useful. Is this review useful?

The iPhone 8 Plus’ updates don’t warrant a full number bump, but they’re welcome improvements that make it another great iPhone.. Great camera, fun Portrait Mode features. Pretty colors, but a dated design. Fantastic True Tone display, louder speakers. Unrivaled performance, AR for the masses. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. The name of one phone is rolling off everyone’s tongues: iPhone X. The X (pronounced “ten”) is Apple’s all new design for the iPhone, with an edge-to-edge. screen, fancy facial recognition features, and an eye-widening price tag .. If the $1,000 asking price is too much for you, and you can’t wait until November, there’s the traditional-looking iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. These new iPhones carry many of the same specifications as the iPhone X, but are they worth the upgrade? In our iPhone 8 review and our iPhone 8 Plus review, we find the phones tick all the boxes but are minor bumps over last year’s models.. Put the iPhone 8 Plus next to the iPhone 7 Plus and you’ll hardly notice a difference. The 8 Plus is marginally thicker and longer, but it should still be able to fit in any 7 Plus case. It carries the same design theme from the iPhone 6, but the major difference is a new glass back, which allows it to support wireless charging technology. Apple said it’s the most durable glass ever in a smartphone, with a “50 percent deeper strengthening layer,” but that doesn’t necessarily mean it will survive a drop on concrete. You’d be wise to protect it with a case .. There are fewer color options now: Gold, silver, and space gray (goodbye rose gold and jet black). The silver and space gray models are similar to the silver and black iPhone 7 Plus devices, but the gold is slightly more champagne-gold. The rear has a creamy, pinkish hue that we like, and the “aerospace-grade” aluminum sides are a darker gold. Adding to this elegance are the antenna bands, which have been moved to the sides, rather than visibly sticking out at the top and bottom. It makes the rear look more minimal than ever, as there’s just the dual camera module and flash at the top, along with the Apple and iPhone logo. Even the iconic “Designed by Apple in California” line has been stripped.. Sadly, the camera still juts out of the frame. Most flagship Android phones have evolved past this camera bump; why can’t Apple do the same? Even the iPhone X has this annoyance. Cameras look better when they’re flush with the rear, and it gives us more peace of mind when placing the phone down on any flat surface.. The iPhone 8 Plus is noticeably heavier than the iPhone 7 Plus, but not in a bad way. The added heft makes it feel as though the phone won’t slide out of our hands. The glass back is smooth and cool to the touch, but you won’t feel much of a difference if you’re coming from a Jet Black iPhone. It’s still a fingerprint magnet, but at least they’re less visible on the gold and silver colors.. As usual, you’ll find the power button on the right edge, with the volume rocker and mute switch on the left. The force-sensitive home button sits on the front (it may be the last iPhone with a home button), and you’ll find a Lightning port on the bottom with the speakers. There’s no headphone jack again, sadly, but there is a Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter in the box. The iPhone 8 Plus is once again IP67 dust- and water-resistant, so you can take it underwater up to 1 meter for 30 minutes. We’d have liked to see an improved IP68 water resistance, like Samsung’s smartphones, but IP67 should be more than enough for most situations.. As much as we admire the rear, flip the iPhone 8 Plus over and it feels like we’ve traveled back in time to 2015. is Apple’s edge-to-edge “ bezel-less ” competitor to phones like Samsung’s Galaxy S8. or Note 8 , and the LG V30. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus? Not so much. The screen is flanked by chunky edges that make the phone’s design look dated and unpleasant.. The bezel-less trend isn’t just about aesthetics. Shrinking the edges around the screen offers more display in a smaller package. The iPhone X is a good example. It’s just barely bigger than the 4.7-inch iPhone 8, but it boasts a 5.8-inch display. You’re getting a bigger screen than the bulky 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus, all in a smaller frame.. The iPhone 8 Plus is unwieldy, and it’s near impossible to reach the top of the phone. Thankfully, you can lightly tap the home button twice to lower the interface so it’s reachable. It’s a shame, though, that Apple is forcing people to shell out more money for a more relevant and functional design.. At the end of the day, the iPhone 8 Plus is still an iPhone. If you don’t care for the features or price of the iPhone X, you know exactly what you’re getting with the iPhone 8 Plus because it’s incredibly similar to the past few iPhones. Just know that with the X, you’re paying a premium for Apple’s next-gen design.. The iPhone 8 Plus’ display isn’t any different from the iPhone 7 Plus. It’s a 5.5-inch LCD IPS screen with a 1,920 × 1,080-pixel resolution (401 pixels-per-inch). It can get incredibly bright for easy viewing in direct sunlight; and as always, the colors are accurate and visually pop off the screen. Looking at it from the side, the display looks like a sheet of paper, because it doesn’t catch as much glare as other smartphones. It’s absolutely a joy to stare at and use.. What is new, however, is True Tone technology. A feature that’s trickled down from the iPad Pro, True Tone automatically changes the iPhone’s display “based on ambient lighting conditions to make colors appear consistent in different environments.” So for example, in incandescent lighting where everything has a yellow hue, the display will shift from slightly cool to a warmer tone. It can be tough to notice, but it works like a charm, and it makes it easier for your eyes to adapt to the screen.. The stereo speakers have also improved. They’re decently louder than the iPhone 7 Plus (about 25 percent to be exact), but they sound richer as well. We listened to Fiona Apple’s “Why Try To Change Me Now,” and on the iPhone 7 Plus it sounded like I was playing an MP3 file, but on the iPhone 8 Plus it felt as though she could have been in the same room.. Again, these are minor improvements over last year’s phone, but the display is now a little more adaptive to your environment, and you’ll have a slightly better listening experience when playing music with the speakers.. One category where Apple continues to blow away the competition is performance. Apple’s processors outperform anything from Qualcomm or Samsung, and the same rings true for the A11 Bionic in the 8, 8 Plus, and X.. In official Geekbench scores , the six-core A11 Bionic hit a whopping 4,198 on its single-core score, and 9,983 on multicore. In our test, it scored similarly: 4,238 and 10,453 respectively. For comparison, our Galaxy S8 scored 1,762 single core, and 5,723 multi core. In our own test with the AnTuTu benchmarking tool, the iPhone 8 Plus scored 222,462. Our S8’s AnTuTu score is 155,253, and HTC’s U11. It’s fair to say the iPhone is more powerful.. Apple’s processors outperform anything from Qualcomm or Samsung, and the same rings true for the A11 Bionic.. But benchmarks aside, it’ll be tough to spot the performance improvement from the iPhone 7 Plus. The iOS operating system moves just as fluid, apps open incredibly quickly, and scrolling feels buttery smooth. Apple said this performance bump will be handy for machine learning and artificial intelligence, but one way to perhaps see the A11 Bionic’s true power is through augmented reality.. Apple has brought AR to the masses, not with the iPhone 8, but with iOS 11. ARKit is the new framework developers can use to provide augmented features with your iPhone camera. For example, one of our favorite ARKit apps, Ikea Place, lets you drop Ikea furniture into your house to see how it would fit in with the rest of your furniture, and if it can actually fit in the room. An app called AR MeasureKit can impressively find the measurement of objects you point the iPhone camera towards (goodbye rulers).. Gaming is where the A11 shines, and credit is due to the Apple-designed graphics processing unit. We played augmented reality games like Euclidean Lands , Conduct AR! , and The Machines , and the graphics look great. We never ran into any performance issues whatsoever, but the phone did start to get quite hot.. Apple iPhone 8 Plus Compared To. Keep in mind, though, that you don’t need an iPhone 8 or 8 Plus to check out these AR apps and games. We’ve tried a few of the same apps on the iPhone 7 Plus, and they ran fine with with similar performance. You just need to install iOS 11, which is available for the iPhone 5S and above.. Bluetooth 5 is on board, which means you get much improved range and faster data transfer when connected to wireless devices like headphones.. Like the iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 11 isn’t a major upgrade to Apple’s mobile operating system. That doesn’t mean there aren’t important changes — the update streamlines the iOS experience further than iOS 10, and even adds more customization options.. First off, there’s a new Control Center. It’s all available on one screen now when you swipe up from the bottom, and you can tweak what you want to see here. Want a quick toggle to Low Power Mode? Done. Want to turn off True Tone display? Use 3D Touch on the brightness slider and toggle it off. We’d like to see even more options available, but this is a great start.. The Notification Center is also a little different. Now when you pull down your notifications, you’ll be greeted with the lock screen. You can swipe to the left to access the camera, and swipe to the right to access to Today widgets. Notifications are separated by day, so you have to swipe to the next day’s notifications if you want to see the “X” icon to clear everything.. Photos and videos are now captured in new formats. High Efficiency Image Format (HEIF), and High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). These formats basically offer the same if not better quality than JPEG, but at a much reduced file size — helpful if you’re planning to take a lot of 4K video.. There’s also a redesigned App Store, which is one of our favorite improvements to iOS. It’s no longer a mindless marketplace with difficult-to-find apps. It now follows a magazine-style layout, with featured stories on apps, tips and tricks, and a daily app of the day to keep you coming back.. A lot of smaller additions also make iOS 11 more pleasant to use, such as a revamped Notes app, a new Files app to manage all your documents, and a Do Not Disturb mode that automatically kicks in when you’re driving. Check out our iOS 11 review. The iPhone 8 Plus carries over nearly the same camera specifications as the iPhone 7 Plus, which first introduced Apple’s dual-camera system. It has two 12-megapixel cameras, one wide-angle lens with optical image stabilization (f/1.8 aperture), and one telephoto lens (f/2.8 aperture).. The telephoto lens is used for Portrait Mode, which adds a blur or “bokeh” effect behind a subject, but what the iPhone 8 Plus will have over its predecessor is a new mode called Portrait Lighting.. Before diving into Portrait Lighting, let’s talk about the regular camera experience. There’s now a permanently on HDR mode, which drastically changes the look of photos when compared to the iPhone 7 Plus. Ever have a photo where the sky is too white and overexposed, or the subject is far too dark but the sky looks normal? HDR fixes that by taking multiple images and compiling them together to get a perfectly exposed photo. These photos are incredibly detailed, and the color accuracy is impressive, though a tad more saturated than the iPhone 7 Plus — it still looks great. Photos are captured instantly because there’s almost no shutter lag, which helps a lot with moving subjects.. Low-light seems to have improved with less grain, but we’ll have to do more testing to be sure. There’s 2x optical zoom available, and it’s just as useful as before. We’re happy to have the option to zoom into a photo without sacrificing image quality, but we’re still surprised at how much detail is captured.. Apple said regular Portrait Mode is also improved, and the results are telling. The 8 Plus does a better job of detecting the edges of subjects, and the blur effect looks even more natural than before. It’s still not great in low-light environments, because the photos are incredibly grainy.. Portrait Lighting expands upon Portait Mode to offer five different types of lighting effects on subjects: Natural Light, Studio Light, Contour Light, Stage Light, and Stage Light Mono. These aren’t filters, but Apple said the iPhone 8 Plus’ camera uses facial landmarking and depth maps to figure out where to perfectly add these lighting effects. It’s a fun feature we can see being popular, especially on Instagram, but there are still some kinks that need to be worked out.. Studio Light, Contour Light, Natural Light, Stage Light Mono.. The Stage Light Mono, for example, takes a photo in black and white against a deep black background. It often struggled with accurately catching some strands of hair (it would just look cut off), and it also didn’t work as well on people wearing glasses. You still need to put some thought into the shot to get a good result, but it’s a lot of fun to use and it makes us want to explore the camera further.. Photos are incredibly detailed, and the color accuracy is impressive.. Do be warned, though, that like Portrait Mode, Portrait Lighting doesn’t work that well in low-light. The photos come out super grainy, and the effects don’t look right at all.. Our favorite Portrait Lighting setting is Studio Light, which brightens the subject dramatically for a cool effect. Portrait Lighting is still in beta, but it will likely officially launch sometime in October or November — similar to how Portrait Mode launched on the iPhone 7 Plus.. Overall, the camera update isn’t dramatic, but the always-on HDR and Portrait features are welcome improvements.. On the video side of things, you can shoot in varying types of 4K — 24 frames-per-second for a cinematic look, 30 fps, and 60 fps. What we like more, however, is how you can now shoot slow-motion videos at 240 fps in 1080p resolution. It’s a lot of fun to use, and the end result is finally Full HD.. The all-glass design of the iPhone 8 Plus means it’s now capable of wirelessly charging. It’s not “true” wireless charging — the charging pad you plop your iPhone on still needs to be connected to an outlet, but it eliminates the need to fish around for a cable in the dark before bed. Apple uses the Qi wireless standard; it’s an open standard that has been around for some time. Android phones have been using this standard for a while, and the good news is that means you have plenty of wireless charging pads to choose from.. Apple could have, and likely should have, added it some time ago.. You should know that the iPhone 8 Plus won’t wirelessly charge as fast as it can at launch. It can take in 5 watts at launch, but Apple will issue a software update later in the fall to allow the phone to take 7.5 watts. Mophie and Belkin have specifically worked with Apple to make sure their wireless chargers can deliver 7.5 watts as efficiently as possible.. Wireless charging is convenient and easy to use, just as it is in all the Android phones that support it. Apple could have, and likely should have, added it some time ago.. The iPhone 8 Plus’ battery life is on par with many other flagship smartphones, offering about a day’s worth of use. We frequently returned home with 40 percent battery left around 6:30 p.m. with heavy use — that includes taking photos, watching videos, browsing social media and the web, and streaming music. Charging speed isn’t as fast as we’d like — it took an hour and a half to go from 36 percent to 100 percent. The iPhone 8 Plus is capable of fast charging, but not with the cable in the box. You’ll need a USB Type-C to Lightning cable to charge fast, and Apple claims it will take 30 minutes to get the iPhone up to 50 percent from zero. It’s baffling why this cable is not included.. Apple offers a standard one-year warranty, starting at the date of purchase, that covers your device from manufacturing defects. It doesn’t cover liquid or accidental damage. For that, you can purchase $150 AppleCare+ insurance, which adds two years of technical support and accidental damage coverage.. The iPhone 8 Plus comes in two storage models: 64GB and 256GB. The former will set you back $800, and the latter will cost $950. It’s available now at all major U.S. carriers, as well as the Apple Store.. The iPhone 8 Plus should really be called the iPhone 7S Plus. Its updates don’t warrant a full number bump, but they’re welcome improvements that make the 8 Plus another great iPhone.. For iOS users, your next best bet is the upcoming iPhone X. It beats out the iPhone 8 Plus in most specifications and features, and it also has Apple’s new design language. It looks too good to ignore for any iPhone enthusiast.. If you don’t care for the special facial tracking features, you won’t be disappointed with the iPhone 8 Plus — though maybe a little sad the design hasn’t changed.. There are far more options if you’re willing to jump to Android. The two most notable are the LG V30 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Both feature bezel-less designs, offer great performance, and have unique camera experiences.. Apple is known to support its products for a long time, so we expect the iPhone 8 Plus to last four to five years, if not more. You should definitely get a case to protect the phone from accidental drops, but the waterproofing protects it from liquids. Expect to continue getting software updates for a similar length of time.. If you don’t want to spend $1,000 on the iPhone X, the iPhone 8 Plus is the next best thing.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

GSM / EDGE / UMTS / HSPA+ / DC-HSDPA / FDD-LTE / TD-LTE. by dougsmarket Dec 13, 2017. Moved up from S4 and very pleased.. Never has I phone before and so far very pleased. I opted for large memoyy and unlocked phone so I could change carrier if I wanted to. The best thing I noticed is that after reinstalling all my apps, there are NO ADDS as I was totally overloaded with adds on the android system. I is also very nice to have a battery that lasts 1.5 days and the wireless charging pad (optional) is a great convenience. I am in a rural area and have fewer dropped calls now and apps load and run so much faster. Camera is very high quality also. This plus model is larger and took a little getting used to, but I really like the larger screen. This was a great price, brand new in box with full factory warranty.. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New. by bryan.y.yu Oct 08, 2017. This phone has by far the best looking screen ever. Even better than the iPhone X because it’s bigger in size and the colors are realistic and clear. The phone is exceptionally fast, it loads contents like a champ and the wireless charging is so cool. I know other companies have already offered that but not Apple so I don’t care. I am an Apple user and I have many Apple products and they’re all connected and work like work of art! The speakers on this phone seems to be louder and the phone in general feels a little heavier but solid even though it’s pretty much all glass except for the sides which are stainless steal. I got the 256GB model because I intend on using this phone for years to come. There is nothing else I would want in a phone that is not already in this phone. I didn’t want t o wait for the iPhone X because I don’t want the stupid notched bezel that houses the earpiece and camera and I don’t care for the facial recognition. It just doesn’t make sense to get the iPhone X. I’m getting more for my money getting the 256GB version because I originally had the iPhone 7 128GB and I almost used up all the room because of all the photos/videos I take on the phone and documents that I save on the iPhone itself not on iCloud. Again, I have nothing but great things to say about this phone! I would buy it again and I’m trying to get my wife to buy one if she can sell her iPhone 7Plus to someone else. by techietrader Nov 28, 2017. 8 plus is Heavier and thicker. The 8 plus is actually heavier and thicker than the 7 plus. Also interesting is that the battery in the 8 plus has a slightly lower capacity than the one in the 7. I believe this was possibly due to increased efficiency in the 8's processors, so that the talking time etc.comes out about the same. Other than slightly louder speakers and the wireless charging, there isn't that much of a difference from the 7. The wireless charging works well and they are a number of wireless charging stations less than $12. I have a couple so I can charge my phone at night on the bedstand and keep it charged during the day at my desk. Next I'll need to get a wireless charger/holder for the car, and that will require another review. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned. by tale_91775 Dec 13, 2017. There is no problem at all. It has longer battery life and big improvement on camera. It is a very good value phone.. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New. by hooksa70 Dec 17, 2017. It’s a great phone, love the pictures quality, so far I have no any problem with it. There many memory space to download whatever I need and I’m crazy about that..

The iPhone 8 Plus shares a powerful foundation with the iPhone 8, but a few features give it a distinct advantage over its little brother. Its 12-megapixel dual camera is one of the best we've used, and its bigger battery means it'll stick around longer on a charge than the iPhone 8.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 2 Interface, Siri vs Bixby, Performance. 4 Battery life, Call quality and Conclusion. Apple iPhone 8 Plus vs Samsung Galaxy S8+. Apple iPhone 8 Plus vs Samsung Galaxy S8+. by Victor Hristov. T-Mobile - T-Mobile + AT&T - AT&T + Verizon - Verizon + Sprint - Sprint + Samsung - Samsung + iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple + Android - Android +. 1 Introduction, Design and Display. 2 Interface, Siri vs Bixby, Performance. 4 Battery life, Call quality and Conclusion. As much as there is competition in smartphones, in the past couple of years we have seen two companies take over: Apple’s iPhones have become the default options for many and Samsung with its Galaxy has grown nearly synonymous with Android. It’s only natural then to compare Apple’s newest iPhone 8 Plus against its rival, the Samsung Galaxy S8+. After all, both are big phones and both represent the finest from the two companies. The S8+ is now cheaper as it’s been on the market for nearly half a year, but it’s not outdated by any means. It lacks the dual cameras of the iPhone , but matches it and outdoes it in other aspects. And while both are great phones, they are better at different things and we’re about to learn more about those differences right away. Design The iPhone 8 Plus feels like a slight update to an aging design, while the Galaxy looks sleeker, more modern. Samsung has leaped forward with beautiful, sleek, futuristic glass and metal concoctions, and the Galaxy S8+ is just that: one stylish phone with an immersive display. Apple, you ask? Well, it actually seems to be lagging behind these days: the iPhone 8 Plus has a glass back which adds style points, but the huge bezel up front remind us that we are still looking at the same four-year old design. There are a few footnotes to all of this. First is color: the iPhone ships in three colors, but while they might sound familiar, the actual tones are different than on earlier iPhones. The silver one looks downright white and very clean, the gold one is a new shade of gold that is a mix between rose gold and the old gold, and both mask fingerprints extremely well. The space grey one actually has a brownish tone and is not even close to the deep hue of say last year’s jet black or even matte black options (it’s the only one where you can see fingerprint smudges easily). The S8+? It ships in four colors: black, blue, silver and gray, and finger smudges are very noticeable on all of those models. In practical terms, the glass on both is not slippery, but can definitely shatter when you drop the phones, so a case is strongly recommended (yes, a case also admittedly ruins a lot of the design effort that went into those phones...). The other important thing is to fully understand just how big these phones are. Neither phone fits comfortably in a jeans pocket, but the iPhone is especially uncomfortable. The S8+ is narrower, while the iPhone 8 Plus is very wide and you have to use both of your hands most of the times with these phones. Here are the actual physical sizes of both: iPhone 8 Plus: 6.24 x 3.07 x 0.30 inches S8+: 6.28 x 2.89 x 0.32 inches The iPhone weighs 7.13 ounces (202g) and is considerably heavier than the S8+ with its 6.10 oz (173g) of weight. We like a phone with a solid feeling in the hand, but if you are used to carrying your phone in your pants pockets, the extra weight of the iPhone adds to the inconvenience of having an already big phone, and can definitely be felt. Considering they are so big, it is a bit annoying that Samsung continues to put the fingerprint scanner way out of reach and next the camera on the S8+. You get used to it, but it remains a daily inconvenience. In contrast, the front-placed iPhone 8 Plus finger scanner feels much more natural to use. One last thing to know is that both phones are water-sealed (great news!): the iPhone carries an IP67 rating, while the S8+ has a higher, IP68 certification. What this means is that both are protected from dust ingress, and both can be submerged in water: the iPhone can withstand immersion in up to 3-feet deep water, while the IP68 S8+ can theoretically withstand up to 5-feet water depth, and both are guaranteed to survive in water for as long as 30 minutes.. Display The S8+ has an immersive, bezel-less AMOLED display with punchy colors that pulls ahead. The iPhone has big bezels from the past, but colors also look great on it. There are two things that make high-end phones stand out: one is the camera and the other is the display. And these two sure stand out, as they have two of the finest screens out there. The S8+ sports a 6.3-inch Super AMOLED display, while the iPhone 8 Plus features a 5.5-inch LCD. Both default to 1080p resolution, but you can set a higher, Quad HD resolution on the S8+ (this will result in theoretically better sharpness, but will also negatively affect the battery life). The big difference here, however, is in the form of the screen. Samsung calls its screen the “Infinity Display” because it feels like it flows into the body of the phone and has almost no bezels. The screen-to-body ratio of the S8+ is a whopping 83%, while on the iPhone it is merely 67.5% because of those big bezels on the top and the bottom. This sets the two apart in a big way: the S8+ feels more immersive and it fits more content. But it’s not just size: it’s the lively colors that impress the most with these two. The S8+ has different color modes where you can tweak its appearance, but the default Adaptive mode shows punchy, saturated colors, with great contrast and deep blacks. The iPhone 8 Plus also has very pleasing colors, but they do not quite reach the lush tones you see on the S8+. Blacks appear slightly more grayish and contrast is a bit lower, but everything also looks a bit better balanced, even if slightly toned down. Then, the iPhone 8 Plus comes with one neat innovation: True Tone technology. True Tone will adapt the display’s white balance to ambient light, usually making your phone look slightly warmer indoors, for a more natural look. 6.24 x 3.07 x 0.3 inches. 158.4 x 78.1 x 7.5 mm. 6.28 x 2.89 x 0.32 inches. 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1 mm.

Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Specifications News [170] Rivals Size it Videos.

Game performance? all mobile games have fps cap, and even mid-ranger SoC can hit that fps cap (as reminder, all mobile games use much lower graphic than 3D benchmarking tools). UI fluidity? it's also capped at 60Hz (except 120Hz on the new sharp and sony phone). (Posts: 208; Member since: 10 Oct 2017). posted on 11 Oct 2017, 09:49.

Even if you compare the latest iPhone 8 with the S8 or S8+. The iPhone 8 is only pushing the same low resolution display, compared to the S8's that are pushing more than 4 times the number of pixels. BTW the iPhone 7 A10 GPU is rated at 249 gigaflops compared to the SD 835's 570 gigaflops GPU. The iPhone 6s is rated at 170 gigaflops. If the A11 and iOS are really that fast, then the latest iOS should support real multitasking and split screen multitasking. Instead iOS on iPhones in 2017 is still a task switcher that halts the task you just switched from. Please cnour continue to look like an ignorant person. Just keep drinking that Apple Koolaid.. (Posts: 2305; Member since: 11 Sep 2014). posted on 11 Oct 2017, 13:38. Sorry but what you call REAL multitasking is on iPad that uses iOS 11 and A10X as chip with 3 GB of RAM and large screen.

PA, ya gotta do better man. The S8 Plus is far far better, than what you listed here. It put my 7 Plus to shame in every area, including battery life, and the 8 Plus is nothing more than a 7S Plus.

Clearly if you're looking to simulate all of this via a web browser script it isn't accurate. since a single flaw would not taint the results of such a wide test.

The performance on the iPhone are no match but it looks like an mid range phone to be honest.. (Posts: 1; Member since: 06 Nov 2017). posted on 06 Nov 2017, 14:40. Do any of you actually work with your phone? Or is it all games, videos and photo-taking? I use my phone for work. Phone calls (yes, I actually call people rather than bounce texts), email, calculations, apps specific to what I do, which is engineering and construction. Its a tool, not a toy. I've had iphones since the 3GS, and I'm not happy with Apple's progress regarding technical advances, especially over these past two product cycles. Steve Jobs, you are sorely missed, and I say that with my not being an Apple groupie. Why do I stay with them? In two words: the apps. I've bought samsung products (tablets) and have downloaded a number of apps similar to what I use every day. For the most part, they aren't on the same planet as the iphone apps from a standpoint of usability. The problem I am having with all of these phone reviews I am seeing on the iphone and the android phones is they focus on the fluff like screen resolution and form, and the technical specs, as if the damn things actually perform for real as they did in the lab. Regarding performance in real terms, about something that actually means something to me? Nada. I guess what I want and what everyone else wants to argue over are two different things, but COME ON, APPLE! Is Tim Cook the best you can do?.

Video camera still recording mono audio only. In another place and another time, the Apple iPhone 8 Plus would have been one of the hottest things around. Swathed in hype, causing a stir, bringing the free ride of the competition's flagships to an abrupt and painful halt.. This turbo-powered, glass-clad, sharp-shooting and fast-charging piece of a smartphone classic seems to have everything. It's just that its days as one of the hottest things around are numbered. Now, we're sure you know what we mean, so let's slow down and start over. Time isn't always a luxury - just don't tell this to an iPhone 8 Plus.. The 8 series is about to leave generations of iPhones behind. It's been ten years of refining the visionary iPhone. We saw it grow bigger, better, more durable, more powerful. Apple kept adding more screen real estate, more processing power and advanced camera features. In spite of all novelties, the iPhone essence was always there, underneath the fancy add-ons. Apple isn't just on the verge of breaking clean from the past. The future has already begun with the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. But it doesn't belong to them.. Back to the here and now, the Apple iPhone 8 Plus comes across as the usual incremental upgrade. The 8 Plus gets to keep its overall styling but swaps aluminum for glass and finally gets wireless charging. The new A11 Bionic chipset boasts an extra two power-efficient cores and, for the first time ever, an in-house GPU. Then the base iPhone storage has been doubled and now starts at 64GB.. Browsing the camera specs leave the wrong impression of copy and paste from the iPhone 7 Plus, when in fact both of the dual 12MP sensors have bigger pixels, backed by a superior flash and an exclusive new Portrait Lightning mode, which hopes to make the portrait shots look even better.. Finally, the screen size and resolution might be the same, but Apple has added HDR10 and Dolby Vision support, as well as iPad's True Tone color adjustment for life-like color presentation.. Indeed, the iPhone 8 Plus seems like a regular update but with the right touches in the right places. The screen bezels are here to stay but probably for the last time. The audio jack is already a goner, that's for sure, while memory expansion was never meant to be.. Some may still have gripes with the over-reliance on the iTunes software for music transfer to the phone, but in times of Apple Music, Spotify, Google Music, and Groove - we think this is another issue we mention one last time.. The iPhone 8 Plus is fresh off the assembly lines, but the iPhone X is just around the corner, while the iPhone 7 Plus is still relevant and cheaper.. Is the upgrade worth it? Is a switch worth it? Should I wait? The choice has never been harder, but the answers start rolling right after the break.. Final thoughts, key test findings, alternatives, verdict.
