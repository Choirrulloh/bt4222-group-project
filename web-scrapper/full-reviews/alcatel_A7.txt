Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Octa-core, 1500 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 22.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular Data: LTE-A Cat 6 (300/50 Mbit/s). Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: NFC, VoIP, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device.

The Alcatel A7 is an unremarkable budget smartphone in many respects, but its big screen and even bigger battery will help it stand out from other handsets currently on the market.. Rear-mounted fingerprint sensor too close to camera. Alcatel A7 release date and price Design and display Battery life and camera Other specs and features Early verdict I FA 2017 is Europe's biggest tech show. The TechRadar team is in Berlin to bring you all the breaking news and hands-on first impressions of new phones, watches and other tech as they're announced.. Alcatel has introduced a new budget smartphone at IFA 2017 , the A7. While it’s low in price it's also relatively low on specs and interesting features, but the A7 does offer a larger-than-average screen and a good-sized battery for its price.. The 5.5-inch Full HD display and 4000mAh power pack potentially make this a great budget buy for those who mostly use their phone for basic tasks but rarely have it out of their hands. There's also a decent 16MP rear camera.. The Alcatel A7 is available now in Europe for €229.99 (around £210), but its UK release date and exact price are yet to be confirmed. The phone will be launching in Australia in early 2018, where it’ll cost $299 SIM-free.. The A7 is a sleek-looking budget smartphone with a refreshingly bold design. Its metallic black casing is stylish, but it avoids looking dull thanks to the subtle engraved spin effect on the casing and the addition of accents around the home button, top speaker, fingerprint sensor and camera lens.. This design should certainly help the A7 stand out from other budget smartphones. However, it’s a shame that there's just the one color choice. Though it looks good, it seems like a wasted opportunity on Alcatel’s part that it didn’t play around with a variety of casing and accent color combinations to give potential buyers more choice.. The phone’s edges are smooth and pleasantly curved, and the metal casing feels smooth on the palm. The 5.5-inch display is larger than average, and though it sat comfortably in our palm we did struggle to stretch our thumb the whole way across the screen, which makes us thing that those with smaller hands may be less comfortable using the device one-handed.. We found the Full HD screen more than up to the task of filling all that space with a bright and clear display. Alcatel isn’t doing anything astonishing with its display here, other than making it larger than average for a budget handset, but it certainly looks good.. You’ll either love or loathe the placement of the A7's fingerprint scanner. It's on the back of the phone, and while we didn’t get the chance to test how accurate the scanner is, we were slightly put out by the fact that it sits directly below the phone’s camera lens.. While the other new phone announced by Alcatel at IFA, the Idol 5 , kept the scanner and camera far apart, the A7 unfortunately leaves open the possibility that you’ll smudge your camera lens every time you unlock your phone to take a picture.. Wired headphone lovers will be glad to know that a 3.5mm headphone jack can be found on the phone’s top, while at the bottom there are two speakers flanking a micro USB charging port. On the phone’s right side you’ll find two buttons, one for volume and the other for power.. When it comes to battery life, the Alcatel A7 demands your attention. It offers an impressive 4000mAh battery which can be fully recharged in around two and a half hours.. This is a good-sized battery considering the phone’s budget price point – the more expensive Idol 5, for example, only offers a 2800mAh power pack. However, given that the A7 is being targeted towards those who 'never rest', good battery life is the least we should expect.. There's a pretty respectable camera on offer here too. The A7 has a 16MP rear camera and a 8MP selfie camera. We got the chance to try out the rear camera, and as far as we could tell it was more than capable of taking good shots of your everyday life, although we’d want to test it in conditions other than a conference hall before passing full judgement.. Inside the Alcatel A7 you’ll find a MT6750T octa-core chipset and 3GB of RAM. 3GB isn’t a huge amount these days, but from what we could see the phone didn’t struggle to keep up with our quick switching between apps.. As with the camera, we’ll have to wait for our full review to see whether or not the phone can efficiently cope with the multi-tasking its presumed target market will likely be engaging in.. There’s 32GB of storage on offer in the A7, which just about passable for a budget phone but not overly generous; if you need more storage there is at least the option to expand this up to 128GB via microSD card.. The phone runs Android 7; with Android Oreo coming this may not be the case for long, but we’re not sure how long it’ll take Alcatel to bring the new software to the A7, and it’s unlikely to be one of the first phones to get it.. Overall, the Alcatel A7 looks to be an appealing budget smartphone proposition. Its specs aren’t anything special, but given its low price that’s really not surprising. If you prioritize battery life and price, and don’t need your smartphone to do anything particularly fancy, it could be worth looking at.. What is a hands on review?. 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.

Our Alcatel A7 review finds a mid-range smartphone that has a great looking design but more importantly, a high capacity battery that can give a full days use to even heavy users.. The Alcatel A7 has a front made of durable Dragontrail glass, which is very similar to the more well known Corning Gorilla Glass. This offers scratch and knock resistance for the 5.5” Full HD IPS display.. Fill in the form and be the first to know when the Alcatel A7 is released .. The display has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and this works out at an impressive 401 pixels per inch. The viewing experience remains good, thanks to an oleophobic coating, which resists fingerprint smudges on the touch screen.. New: Alcatel A7 XL review. The Full HD screen is excellent for video streaming, graphics intensive gaming or multitasking. There is very little delay when opening apps, or switching between them, thanks to a fast octa-core Mediatek 1.5GHz processor with 3GB RAM.. The Alcatel A7 does look pretty good. with its spin-effect textured back, that adds a touch of premium to the mix. This Alcatel phone will only be available in Metallic Black but there are gold accents added to the ear peace, microphone, buttons, camera module and fingerprint sensor.. The Alcatel A7 weighs 164g and is 8.95mm thick and both of these fall within the normal range of mid-range smartphones.. The Alcatel A7 is secured through a fingerprint sensor and this is located on the back and just beneath the camera lens and flash. Existing content and media can moved from an old smartphone or iPhone onto the 32GB memory, of which 23GB is free to the user. The microSD card slots accepts cards with values of up to 128GB.. The Alcatel A7 runs on Google’s Android 7.0 Nougat operating system. This gives the user a standard set of pre-loaded apps such as Google Maps, Play Music, YouTube and Gmail. Further apps can be downloaded from the Play Store.. The Alcatel A7 has a camera that has more resolution than quite a few premium phones. The 16MP camera has a wide f/2.0 aperture for letting in more light and offers features like HDR (High Dynamic Range) and EIS (Electronic Image Stabilisation).. The camera uses the latest super-fast (0.3 seconds) Phase Detect Auto Focus system and in low light it can call upon the LED dual tone flash for help. Certain photos can be locked away from prying eyes through the Photo Hide feature.. If you wish to record video, then this can be done at 1080p quality and at 30 frames per second.. The 8MP selfie camera has a wide viewing angle and its own single LED front flash. Real time face beautification allows the owner to preview the results before taking a portrait photo and selfies are organised in a dedicated Selfie Album.. The 4,000mAh battery is the crowning jewel of the Alcatel A7. Research consistently shows that battery performance is of the highest priority to smartphone owners and Alcatel has clearly picked up on this.. The battery offers up to 18 hours of talk time or up to 667 hours of standby, which is approximately 28 days. This is extremely impressive but the story gets better when we consider that a fast charging is to be found in the box.. The fast charger is 3x faster than a standard charger and this can charge the Alcatel A7 from flat to fully charged in just 2.4 hours.. Next: Apple iPhone 8 Plus revie. Galaxy Tab 4 10.1 16GB black.

TCL Communication Technology Holdings Limited (TCL Communication) site. Press release about TCL-Alcatel Joint Venture. This product or company article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it .. This article is about the spun-off phone brand. For the original Alcatel telecommunications company and its successor, see Alcatel-Lucent .. Alcatel (formerly Alcatel OneTouch ) is a French brand of mobile handsets owned by Finnish consumer electronics company Nokia and used under license [1] by Chinese electronics company TCL Corporation. The Alcatel brand was licensed in 2005 by former French electronics and telecommunications company Alcatel-Lucent to TCL for mobile phones and devices, and the current license expires at the end of 2024. Nokia acquired the assets of Alcatel-Lucent in 2016 and thus also inherited the licensing agreements for the Alcatel brand. Alcatel Mobile Phones was established in April 2004 as a joint venture between Alcatel-Lucent (45%) and TCL Corporation (55%). [3] Alcatel originally started making mobile phones in 1998.. In 2005, the joint venture was dissolved and TCL acquired Alcatel-Lucent's 45 percent share, and Alcatel Mobile Phones became a wholly owned subsidiary group of TCL. The brand name was licensed to TCL. In 2010, Alcatel One Touch became the corporate brand. In February 2016, it was changed back to simply Alcatel and a new logo was introduced.. In January 2018, Alcatel announced it would be partnering with Flipkart to bring new Alcatel devices to India. TCL Mobile Limited (former name: T&A Mobile Phones Limited) is a member of TCL Communication listed on Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE: 2618) which was established in August 2004 by TCL Communication and Alcatel. [6] TCL Mobile Limited manages three business units: Alcatel, TCL Mobile Phones and Brand Design Lab. Since 2016 TCL Communication is also the developer of BlackBerry devices.. In 2012, Alcatel won an International Forum Design iF design award for its One Touch 818 and the Onetouch 355 Play models.

Alcatel A5 LED and Alcatel A7 First Impressions. Jagmeet Singh , 10 November 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Alcatel A5 LED and Alcatel A7 are aimed at young Indians. The Alcatel A5 LED has a modular rear. The new Alcatel smartphones have a custom UI on top of Android. TCL brand Alcatel on Thursday expanded its A series with the launch of the A5 LED and A7 smartphones. Both new models are targeted at young buyers and are touted to deliver unique experiences to take on the competition. The A5 LED is specifically designed to let users stand out from the crowd thanks to its modular rear. The company has also launched two modules to support this distinctive feature. We spent some time with the two new Alcatel smartphones following the launch event, and here are our first impressions.. In the growing space of smartphones with narrow screen borders, the Alcatel A5 LED and Alcatel A7 still have thick bezels. Nevertheless, both models are compact enough to fit in your palm comfortably. The Alcatel A5 LED has a height and width of 146mm and 72mm respectively, and a thickness of 10mm. It weighs 159g with the default back cover, though attaching the additional modules will increase its weight to some extent. The Alcatel A7, on the other hand, measures 153x77x9mm. Both devices have plastic bodies and metallic back covers.. The Alcatel A5 LED has thick borders around its 5.2-inch HD IPS display panel. The fingerprint sensor below the screen is accompanied by capacitive Back and Overview buttons. Above the display there is an earpiece, a 5-megapixel front camera, and an LED flash. The volume rocker and power button are on the right, well within reach. At the bottom, the smartphone has a Micro-USB port, loudspeaker, and the primary microphone. The top has a 3.5mm audio jack and a secondary microphone. On the back, the A5 LED has a 13-megapixel primary camera with an LED flash. The default camera app on the A5 LED has features such as panorama and instant collage; the latter works similar to Nokia's Dual-Sight mode and captures photos with the front and rear cameras simultaneously.. The back panel of the Alcatel A5 LED is removable, and can be replaced with modules. The company has two modules, called POWER+ MOD and LIGHTUP+ MOD. As its name suggests, the LIGHTUP+ MOD has built-in multi-coloured LED lights that can be customised with the preloaded LightShow app. You can configure the LEDs to light up for notifications. Also, there are preloaded games that can make use of the LED panel on the back. A Colour Catcher feature lets you adjust the colours of the LED lights based on the environment around you, using the phone's camera to get an idea of your surroundings. Unlike the LIGHTUP+ MOD, the POWER+ MOD is more functional, augmenting the battery life of the Alcatel A5 LED with a 3100mAh battery that complements the phone's own 2800mAh battery.. Alcatel A5 LED sporting LIGHTUP+ MOD. The modular design of the Alcatel A5 LED brings to mind the Moto Z series of phones, which all support a wide range of Moto Mods. However, unlike Moto Mods, the Alcatel ones aren't easily swappable. You need to remove the default back cover to use the POWER+ MOD or the LIGHTUP+ MOD. Having said that, they fit right onto the body and the phone still feels sturdy with them attached - even though they add nearly 3mm of thickness to the device.. The Alcatel A7, on the other hand, has a 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) LTPS display on the front with thinner borders than the A5 LED, and uses on-screen Android navigation buttons. The front panel has a loudspeaker-microphone combo grill but it's a single, monophonic speaker, not part of a stereo pair. Above the screen, you'll find the earpiece, as well as an 8-megapixel secondary camera with an LED flash. On the right, the A7 has volume and power buttons that are easily accessible with one hand. At the bottom, there's a Micro-USB port, whereas the top has a 3.5mm audio jack and secondary microphone.. Unlike the modular back of the A5 LED, the Alcatel A7 has a simple removable rear panel. There's a 16-megapixel primary camera, LED flash, and fingerprint sensor on the back. The default camera app on the smartphone has a time lapse mode in addition to panorama and instant collage modes. Further, there is a 4000mAh battery, and the phone supports fast charging with a 9V 1.67A power source. The company claims that this smartphone can be fully charged in 30 minutes using its fast charging technology.. The Alcatel A5 LED is powered by the MediaTek MT6753 SoC, which has a 1.5GHz octa-core CPU and ARM Mali-T720 MP3 GPU. The phone also has 3GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage which is expandable via a microSD card. There is a hybrid dual-SIM slot to support two 4G SIMS, or one SIM plus a microSD card.. On the other hand, the Alcatel A7 uses the MediaTek MT6750T SoC that has a 1.5GHz octa-core CPU and Mali-T860 MP2 GPU, as well as 4GB of RAM. The smartphone has 32GB of onboard storage that can be expanded using a card. The phone has a hybrid dual-SIM slot, just like the A5 LED.. Alcatel A7 with dual SIM support. On the software side, the Alcatel A5 LED runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow with a custom skin on top. It also has some preloaded apps such as Facebook, Messenger, and WPS Office. Further, there is a Theme Center to let you change the theme, matching your taste and preferences, and a Private mode that lets you pick five apps such as WhatsApp, Instagram and the Phone that you can then launch with each of your fingerprints.The Alcatel A7, contrarily, runs Android 7.0 Nougat with a similar skin, but some default Nougat features are also available to make the experience superior.. Alcatel A7 with Android 7.0 Nougat. After exploring the design and the hardware, we got some time to take a few photos with both the Alcatel A5 LED and the Alcatel A7 at the launch event, but we weren't really pleased with the results. Most of the shots that we captured at the launch venue exhibited some noise when previewed on the phones' own screens. That could be due to dim lights in the room, so we will reserve judgment till we review these phones ourselves.. We didn't find any lag in terms of performance on the A5 LED and A7. Moreover, proprietary features such as the Theme Center and the Private Mode do make these new Alcatel smartphones stand out a bit..

On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. The former French manufacturer of telecommunication equipment merged to Alcatel-Lucent in 2006. Several business segments were sold to other companies, so the Alcatel brand is now used by various companies. The Chinese company TCL uses the brand names "Alcatel One Touch" and "Alcatel Idol" for smartphones and tablets.. The market share in the smartphone + tablet segment is very small, but there are quite some recent reviews in different languages. The ratings are average (as of 2016)..

Alcatel A7 leaks right before the launch at IFA 2017. A new set of leaks show off the benchmark specifications of Alcatel's upcoming A7, along with some renders that show off the A7's minimalist design.. Leaked specifications of the Alcatel A7. CPU : MediaTek MT6750T, Cortex A53. Screen : 5.5 inch 1920 x1080p. Alcatel is looking to bring out a new mid-range contender, and the upcoming Alcatel A7 is expected to make its debut at the IFA 2017 in Berlin early in September. Just days before the actual unveiling, a leak shows the Alcatel A7's specifications through a GFXBench listing along with some interesting images including a render of the phone.. The leak comes courtesy of Roland Quandt of WinFuture. The details are an interesting choice for Alcatel, to say the least. The A7 will have a 5.5-inch full HD 1080p display, a MediaTek MT6750T chipset and processor, an option for 3GB or 4GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, a 16-megapixel camera at the rear, and a pair of 8-megapixel front cameras for a nice dual camera selfie setup. It will run Android 7.0 Nougat.. — Roland Quandt (@rquandt) August 24, 2017. Alcatel A7: 5.5in FHD, 1080p, 3/4 GB RAM, 32GB Flash, Dualcam (I believe) 16 MP, 8 MP front cam, 250 Euro. The leaked renders of the phone, on the other hand, indicate that the phone won't have a home button at the front, and will instead have a stereo speaker setup with one speaker at the bottom.. There's just one important thing to consider. Alcatel has never really been a brand that competed well at the mid and upper ranges. Alcatel is best known for their entry-level phones, which are very affordable and offer great value in that segment. The rumor is that the A7 will go for around USD 295 (Approx. 15,058 PHP), which puts it smack in the mid-range market, and there is just too much competition in that segment, especially for a selfie-centric smartphone. It'll be going up against the OPPO F3 and the Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro in that segment.. Still, it looks like Alcatel is dead set to run with it, and we'll see how it pans out at the IFA. The A7 is also expected to launch alongside another Alcatel handset, the Idol 5. This handset is a smaller 5.2-inch phone with full HD 1080p resolution, a MediaTek MT6735 processor, 3GB of RAM, and 16GB of internal storage with a 13-megapixel front camera and a 2,800mAh battery. It's expected to be priced similarly to the A7.. Do you feel good about the upcoming Alcatel launch? We'll have more information as we cover the IFA in the next few days..
