Mobiles / Micromax Mobile Phones / Micromax Vdeo 2 Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 5,955 Launch Date in India: 15 February, 2017 Compare. Micromax has been one of the dominant presence in the Indian handset market when it comes to the budget segment. One of the USP of the brand was that it came out with a dedicated feature and outdid other handsets in the same price segment, when it came to that particular department.

Here is a brief overview of Micromax Vdeo 2 for those who want an affordable device supporting video call and decent performance.. Integrated VoLTE : There was a time when people used to zero in on a handset and then decide which SIM card or connection to get. However, Reliance JIO changed all that as now people first get a JIO SIM and then look for a handset. It is a brownie point than that the handset comes with an integrated support for the VoLTE feature.. Google Duo pre-loaded : Since the name of the handset is Vdeo 2, the brand had to provide some exclusive feature to justify the name. Micromax has done so by pre-installing the Google Duo app on the device. However, the app can also be downloaded from the Play Store on other handsets.. Dull display : One of the most irritating con that a smartphone can have, close second to weak battery, is a dull display. The display on this handset measures 4.5-inch and has a resolution of 480p. The resulting pixel density gets the job done but feels dull when looked at under direct sunlight, which is a buzzkill.. This is the worst con that any smartphone can be afflicted with and Micromax has done exactly that. The Vdeo 3 smartphone comes with a puny 1800 mAh battery that would not even last half a day if used excessively and is not recommended.. Micromax Vdeo 2 Price in India.

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 8 GB + MicroSD. Too little RAM memory (1 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (218 ppi). The Micromax Vdeo 2 comes with a 4.5-inch display, 1.3 GHz quad-core processor, 1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of storage and a 5-megapixel camera.. Dimensions: 5.20 x 2.60 x 0.38 inches (132 x 66 x 9.7 mm). Resolution: 480 x 854 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Quad-core, 1500 MHz, ARM Cortex-A7, 32-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 4.50 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 5.0 days (120 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

Commenting on the smartphones launch, Shubhajit Sen, Chief Marketing Officer, Micromax Informatics said, "2016 has seen a marked slowdown in the long term trend of Feature Phones users shifting to smartphones. Two barriers we identified were perceived high cost of data and a lack of a differentiated mass-use case. With the launch of the Vdeo range we have focused on these issues. We believe Video calling that is as simple as making a voice call, in a stable environment, will be a strong use case especially in smaller towns. This feature, coupled with free internet connectivity with the pre-bundled Reliance Jio SIM is a compelling proposition that will accelerate the switch from feature phones to smartphones.".
