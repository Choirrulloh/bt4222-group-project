OPPO A71 2018 vs OPPO A83 – Which OPPO phone is better?. Display Design Specifications Software Camera Battery Availability Tagged Oppo , Oppo A71 , Oppo A83. OPPO recently launched their OPPO A83 smartphone with a MediaTek P23 chipset, this device is one of the more budget-friendly offerings of the company similar to the OPPO A71. While both the device share a similar design, there’s a lot different that justifies the difference in the pricing of both the devices.. In this article, we compare and contrast the similarities and the differences between the two devices and help you in choosing one over the other based on your requirement.. The OPPO comes with a smaller 5.2-inch HD display with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels, the A71 comes with an older 16:9 aspect ratio display while the OPPO A83 comes with the 5.7-inch HD+ display with a resolution of 720 x 1440 pixels, the other upgrade on the A83 is the newer 18:9 aspect ratio display. While the OPPO A83 comes with a wider and better looking 18:9 aspect ratio display, most of the media content has not yet be tuned for it and needs to be either stretched or shrieked to be able to use up all the screen. Another difference in perspective comes with the screen sizes, while the smaller display on the A71 fits comfortably in most hands, the bigger display on the A83 also offers more viewing real-estate for a perceivably better experience.. Both the OPPO A71 and A83 come with Metal unibody design which adds a premium feel to the devices. Most of the design language throughout the devices is consistent and they don’t look very different except for the display sizes. Both the devices don’t come with a fingerprint scanner but the OPPO A83 comes with an incredibly fast Face ID login to compensate for the lack of fingerprint sensor.. The OPPO A71 comes with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 processor which is one of the best budget processors in terms of performance and efficiency. The Snapdragon 450 is a 1.8GHz octa-core and the device has 3GB RAM along with 16GB internal storage. Coming to the OPPO A83, the device runs on MediaTek 6763t Helio P23 processor. Although the device runs on a MediaTek processor, the P23 is a very well-tuned chipset and provides excellent performance for the price. Considering the fact that it’s the same manufacturer that has chosen to include a MediaTek processor over the Snapdragon 450 in the higher end variant, we expect the OPPO A83 to perform better than the OPPO A71.. Both the OPPO A71 as well as the OPPO A83 come with the Android 7.1 nougat based ColorOS 3.2 interface. This is a customized version of Android that has several features added to the operating system for what is expected to improve the convenience of the users while also adding certain functionality which was otherwise unseen. The OPPO A83 has a few features more in terms of the software including the extremely fast Face unlock on the A83 which greatly improves the convenience for the user.. The OPPO A71 comes with a 13-megapixel rear camera with Multi-Frame De-Noising Technology that helps reduce the noise in the image via post image processing. The device also has a 5-megapixel front camera with a pixel size of 1.4um pixel. Both the devices come with AI Beauty Technology to improve the renders of the front camera. Talking about the OPPO A83, the device comes with a 13-megapixel rear camera with an F2.2 aperture and an 8-megapixel front camera with a F/2.2 aperture. The OPPO A71 comes with a 3000 mAh battery while the OPPO A83 comes with a 3180 mAh battery. While there is a small difference in the raw capacity of the batteries, this difference in the battery is compensated with the difference in the screen sizes. The OPPO A71 comes with a relatively smaller display powered by a relatively smaller battery and returns about the same usage time as the OPPO A83 with a relatively bigger display and a higher capacity battery to power the same.. The OPPO A71 is available starting at a price of Rs. 9999 and can be purchased on the online shopping portals Amazon, Flipkart, and Snapdeal while the OPPO A83 comes for a price of Rs 13,999 and you can buy it on Flipkart, Amazon and in authorized offline retailers. The offline availability of the OPPO A83 comes as an added bonus as a lot of people still prefers to experience the phone before buying it.. Twitter Facebook Google+. Connect With Us!

Oppo A71 (2018) launches with Snapdragon 450, "AI Beauty Recognition Technology". The Oppo A71 was quietly announced last September , but it looks like it was a short-lived model. That's because today the Oppo A71 (2018) became official in Pakistan, ahead of a probably imminent launch in India.. The A71 (2018) is very similar to its predecessor, but packs in a couple of improvements (and, oddly, 1GB less RAM). It has the same 5.2" 720p display, 16GB of expandable storage, dual-SIM functionality, 13 MP f/2.2 main camera, 5 MP f/2.4 selfie shooter, and 3,000 mAh battery as the original A71. It's even got the exact same dimensions as that, measuring 148.1 x 73.8 x 7.6 mm, and weighs the same 137g.. What's new is the Snapdragon 450 chipset, replacing the old MediaTek MT6750. Qualcomm's SoC comes with the Adreno 506 GPU and a CPU with eight Cortex-A53 cores clocked at up to 1.8 GHz, and should enable an improvement in app starting speed of 12.5% on average compared to last year's A71.. This chip is paired with 2GB of RAM in the Oppo A71 (2018), and the phone runs ColorOS 3.2 based on Android 7.1 Nougat. It's an ever so slightly newer version of the UI overlay compared to the ColorOS 3.1 featured in the original.. That means you can use Oppo's "AI Beauty Recognition Technology", which is "based on a global image database that serves as an experienced photographer, who knows your beauty and will offer the most suitable beautify effect for you", according to the official website.. The Oppo A71 (2018) will be offered in gold and black. It's priced at PKR 19,899 in Pakistan, which at the moment means $179 or 144.. Oppo patents foldable smartphone with a single display.

The Oppo A71 (2018) uses AI to bring out the most beautiful you. by Williams Pelegrin 4 weeks ago. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. One year between smartphones is very normal. Even six months is something we have seen before, but four months? That is how long Oppo took to announce the A71 (2018) , the successor to last September’s A71 .. The A71 (2018) is physically similar to its predecessor. This means we have the same 5.2-inch display with 720p resolution, main 13 MP camera, front 5 MP shooter, 3,000 mAh battery, and 16 GB of expandable storage. Even the dimensions and weight are the same for both devices.. The differences start with the A71 (2018)’s Snapdragon 450 chipset, which replaces MediaTek’s MT6750 chipset found in the previous A71. Oppo says the change to Qualcomm ‘s processor sees up to a 12.5 percent increase in application start-up time.. OPPO launches A83 in India with artificial intelligence technology for selfies. OPPO has unveiled its latest entry-level camera phone in India, the A83.. The OPPO A83 comes with an 8 MP front camera and a 13 MP rear camera, and uses A.I. Beauty Recognition Technology that employs â¦. The company also said the swap should lead to smoother navigation of its ColorOS 3.2 software skin. This is a slight upgrade from the original A71’s ColorOS 3.1, though both versions are still based on Android 7.1 Nougat..

Oppo A71 (2018) first impression: Will AI Beauty feature make the phone competitive. The main USP of the Oppo A71 (2018) is that it comes equipped with an upgraded AI Beauty Technology.. Updated: Friday, February 16, 2018, 16:36 [IST]. Chinese phone maker Oppo on Monday launched the Oppo A71 (2018) in India at Rs. It is the same smartphone that was launched in Pakistan earlier this month, but with a different RAM configuration. The Oppo A71 (2018) in India carries 3GB RAM. Available in Black and Rose Gold color options, the smartphone can be purchased via various online platforms like Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal.. Just like most of the other Oppo phones, the A71 (2018) is also a selfie-focused smartphone. As such, the main USP of the device is that it comes equipped with an upgraded AI Beauty Technology. While there are some other phones with similar features, this is not something you see very often in phones under Rs. Having said that, while we reserve our final verdict for later on when we review the device, we spent some time with the new Oppo A71 (2018) to give you a first look and hands-on of the same.. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!. Design and Display Hardware and Performance Software, Battery and Connectivity Cameras Conclusion. To start with the design, the new Oppo A71 (2018) has the exact same appearance as the original Oppo A71 that was launched in 2017. The smartphone's rear panel is made of metal with the U-shaped fused antenna band lying at the extreme top and bottom edges. Since the antenna lines are not that visible, the device looks clean. The edges of the smartphone are slightly curved, so it fits perfectly in your hand.. The Oppo A71 (2018) is fitted with a 5.2-inch HD screen. Instead of featuring the trending 18:9 aspect ratio, the display has the traditional 16:9 aspect ratio. The bezels are also pretty thick. The smartphone doesn't have any physical button at the front. However, there is a virtual home button, back button and an app switcher button on the lower bezel. The upper bezel houses the selfie camera, earpiece and the sensor. The left side of the phone has the volume rockers, whereas the right side houses the power button and the SIM tray. At the bottom edge, you get a standard micro-USB port and the speaker grille. At the top, there is a 3.5mm audio jack.. Coming to the rear panel, the Oppo A71 (2018) has a single camera with LED flash towards the top left corner. If you go a little south, you can see the Oppo branding. Weighing at just 137 grams, the device is pretty easy to carry.. As stated, the smartphone comes with a 5.2 HD TFT display. Although the display offers HD resolution, the colors look pretty vibrant. And the texts also look sharp. We are yet to test the legibility of the display in sunlight, but our full review will include that.. The smartphone doesn't feature a fingerprint scanner, so setting passwords or lock patterns are your only options.. Well, the Oppo A71 (2018) is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 processor that contains eight 64-bit processing cores clocked at 1.8 GHz. The chipset is coupled with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. The storage space can be further expanded up to 256GB using a microSD card.. In our brief stint with the phone, we didn't notice any any lags or stutter while browsing through the phone or while opening and closing the apps. That said, we didn't play any games and we were not using several applications at the same time. So how the device performs in the long run remains to be seen. We will publish a detailed review regarding this in the coming days.. One thing that impressed us is the audio quality of the smartphone. The external speaker volume is quite loud, and the sound is clear.. Well, the Oppo A71 (2018) runs on custom ColorOS 3.2, which is based on Android 7.1 Nougat. The UI looks neat as the app icons are not gimmicky. So even you have not used an Oppo phone before, you should have any problem with the phone's UI.. The smartphone packs a 3,000mAh battery inside, which can last a day on moderate usage. For us, it lasted for a more than a day on a single charge, though we didn't watch videos for a long time or played games. Interestingly, the smartphone comes with OTG function so it can be used to charge other devices as well.. The dual-SIM smartphone offers connectivity options like 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.2, and GPS. Sensors on board include Proximity Sensor, Light Sensor, Accelerator Sensor and E-compass.. On the imagery front, the Oppo A71 (2018) sports a 13MP rear camera with f/2.2 aperture and LED flash. The rear camera is said to come with a Multi-Frame Denoising Technology that reduces noise for providing a better night photography experience. Further, the camera app has an Ultra HD feature that combines multiple burst photos into one, so pictures taken on the 13MP rear camera look in effect like 32MP. However, we were not impressed with the main camera performance. Pictures captured in daylight turn out to be decent, but the images taken under low-light conditions are grainy. Coming to the front, there is a 5MP sensor with an aperture size of f/2.4. The front camera offers Bokeh Effect, which we tried. Well, the Bokeh Effect is alright, but it is not something outstanding.. The front camera is also equipped with Oppo-specific AI Beauty Recognition technology, which is claimed to capture more than 200 facial features, makes face recognition more accurate and beauty retouching more refined.. Again the selfie camera failed to make any positive impact. The much-hyped Beauty AI Technology is just like any other beauty mode. When you take a selfie, it will just whiten your complexion, blur the sharp edges and increase the color contrast. Basically, the selfies don't give you a natural look.. Well, the Oppo A71 (2018) is priced a bit higher considering the specifications it offers. First, it comes with a rather small display with thick bezels at the top and bottom. Second, the phone doesn't have a fingerprint scanner, which could hamper the retailing of the product.. Moreover, with plethora of smartphones already available in the market with advanced features like the 18:9 aspect ratio, fingerprint sensor and dual camera system, and the most important one being a pocket friendly price, Oppo A71 (2018) might have a hard time catching up with the competition.. While the Oppo 71 (2018) brings the AI Beauty Technology to the budget segment, it is not enough for the phone to stand out from the crowd.. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!.
