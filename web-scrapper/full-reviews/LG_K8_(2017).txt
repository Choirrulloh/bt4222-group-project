The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 22 Dec 2016. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable.

The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards.

The screen colour is not as vibrant as some phones but I have no complaints. I find the internet speed is good and have not noticed any lag. The thing I am impressed with is the battery which lasts two days of moderate use.. If I had to point out a flaw it would be the in call volume on the highest setting was too low during a call.

System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time 12.50 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time 14.9 days (357 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. FCC ID value: ZNFUS215 link. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

LG is offering a combination of some premium features namely, 4G, OTG, Gorilla Glass 3 protection and a relatively nice 13 MP back camera. However, just one more feature could bring this gadget in a better place and it is a 2 GB RAM instead of 1.5 GB. In this price almost all brands are offering at least 2 GB RAM. So, this can hugely influence the decision of a customer. Altogether, LG K8 (2017) is a fine device. But if you value the build quality and brand reputation, Samsung is definitely over LG..

Opiniones y Comentarios LG K8 (2017). Hay 24 opiniones del LG K8 (2017) .. como hago para pasar las fotos que he tomado a la compu siempre me dice que no hay fotos y videos ,estoy usando el cable original del teléfono, me ayudan por favor.. Tengo un LGk8 2017 pero me vino con dos ranuras para SIM es normal o solo los chinos traen dos ranueras para SIM?. tengo el lg k8 2017 modelo LG-X240AR y es de empresa claro de fabrica no se si tendrá algo que ver pero me vino con android 6.0 de fabrica y supuesta mente viene con 7.0 de fabrica. y me llegó una actualización de software pero no para actualizarlo a 7.0. alguien me podría decir que pasa con eso ?. quiero saber si tiene auto captura de pantalla,no la encuentro. Mi móvil tiene sistema v 6 no es v7.. Tiene este modelo(K(-2017) cuando se le apaga la pantalla,una luz que indique que hay un mensaje,correo,etc.. mi opinòn: porque la batería no se carga normal he cargado bien.ahora cuando va en 50% lo conecto y dice cargando. No paso! posterior lo utilice bajo a 20%lo deje mas tiempo y no carga. bien! que solución me pueden apoyar en alguna recomendación.. pesimo telefono la memoria ram solo pasa llena es lento cierra las app y apenas tiene una semana de uso no lo recomiendo. Porque cada vez que agendo un número nuevo en contactos aunque seleccionó la opción de sim después aparecen 2 contactos iguales?. Que hago para que no pase. Actualmente tengo este celular y me siento muy decepcionado, para las características que tiene es demasiado lento con decir que cuando pasas de aplicación en aplicación el celular se pone demasiado lento. Anteriormente tuve un MotoG 4play pero me lo robaron y en comparación con este celular (Ya que las características son prácticamente las mismas a excepción de la memoria RAM que es 0.5 GB menor) el rendimiento es muy lento.

Una alternativa más confiable para desbloquear la pantalla del Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+: Intelligent Scan. Dos propuestas de mediana a baja gama de ZTE: Blade V9 y Blade V9 VITA, dos modelos con ligeras diferencias. Podría ocurrir que se repitan en otro lado, pero las cámaras del Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+ son algo único. Presentación oficial: el Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+ no viene con muchas sorpresas, pero igualmente deslumbra. SmartGSM es una de las comunidades de habla hispana más grandes sobre teléfonos celulares.
