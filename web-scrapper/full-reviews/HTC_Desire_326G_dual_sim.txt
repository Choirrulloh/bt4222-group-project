Network bands in regions may be different, depending on the mobile operator and your location. 4G LTE only available in select countries. Upload and download speeds also depend on the mobile provider.. Available storage is less due to phone software. Approximately 5.5 GB storage available for user content. Available storage is subject to change based on phone software updates and apps usage.. Battery times (talk time, standby time and more) are subject to network and phone usage.. A Standby time specification ("specification") is an industry standard that is only intended to allow comparison of different mobile devices under the same circumstances. Power consumption in a standby state is strongly dependent on factors including but not limited to network, settings, location, movement, signal strength and cell traffic. Comparisons of different mobile devices using such a specification can therefore only be done in a controlled laboratory environment. When using any mobile device in real life circumstances for which the mobile device is intended, the standby time could be considerably lower and will be strongly dependent on the factors mentioned above..

Mobiles / HTC Mobile Phones / HTC Desire 326G Dual SIM Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 72 Launch Date in India: 16 June, 2015 Compare. HTC Desire 326G Dual SIM Description. Easy Mode HTC Blinkfeed Sense User Interface Front firing loudspeaker. HTC , the South Korean handset manufacturing giant, is one of the leading player in the smartphone market around the world. The brand launches its smartphones under two series viz. One and Desire where the former is a flagship lineup while latter caters to customers of all price segment. The HTC Desire 326G Dual SIM is brand's attempt to provide a good looking smartphone to budget segment users. Here is a brief overview of the handset for the benefit of our readers.. The design of the handset features the traditional Desire gloss and bar form factor, which is quite attractive in this price range. At first glance, the handset reminds us of older devices like Desire V and Desire C. The front panel of the handset also houses front-firing loudspeakers that adds to the look and sound quality.. The handset manufacturer has placed a smaller 4.5-inch display on the front panel of the handset, which is kind of a letdown for those who are a keen multimedia lovers. Moreover, the minuscule resolution of 480 x 854 pixels does not help the cause any further.. User experience offered by the handset is not top of the line since it comes with the dated Android 4.4 Kitkat operating system out of the box. Moreover, there is no word regarding whether the handset will be updated to Android Lollipop operating system or not. However, the silver lining here is that the Kitkat update is one of the most stable release by Google.. Coming to the performance of the handset, Desire 326G offers a moderately decent performance as it is equipped with a Quad-core processor clocked at 1.2 GHz. The processor of the handset has 1 GB of RAM to access while multitasking and performing various tasks. There is a 2000 mAh battery in this handset for a decent battery backup.. HTC has placed an 8 Megapixels primary camera on its rear panel that ensures pictures taken by the handset are quite decent. Moreover, the device also comes with a 2 Megapixel snapper on the front panel.. On the connectivity front, there is no 4G LTE in the handset, however, the handset maker has included 3G support in the handset. Besides this there is Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and microUSB for regular connectivity with a number of gadgets.. The Desire 326G seems pretty powerful and capable a smartphone and while it may not be able to beat Moto E at its own game, it will be able to ensure HTC a strong entry ground in the budget smartphone segment. If HTC gets to break into the budget segment, it is just a matter of time before its technical know-how starts trickling down for lesser prices..

A pair of new HTC handsets have launched in India today. The HTC One E9+ Dual SIM and HTC Desire 326G Dual SIM are both available throughout the country, priced at the equivalent of $575 USD and $150 USD respectively. What we have here is one high-end model designed for the specs focused power user, and an entry-level unit designed for those looking to save money on the purchase of a new smartphone. The HTC One E9+ Dual SIM features dual SIM slots. Now that you've recovered from that shock, the model comes with a 5.5-inch screen carrying a resolution of 1440 x 2560.

The 64-bit MediaTek Helio X10 (MT6795M) chipset is under the hood containing an octa-core 2GHz CPU and the PowerVR G6200 GPU. 3GB of RAM is inside with 32GB of native storage. Those requiring additional memory can use the 128GB capacity microSD slot built for just such an occasion. A 20MP camera, with an f/2.2 aperture, is on back. On the front of the phone you will find the same 4MP ultrapixel camera that you'll find on the back of the HTC One (M7) and HTC One (M8). A 2800mAh battery keeps the lights on, and the phone supports 4G LTE, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity. The HTC Desire 326G Dual SIM comes with a 4.5-inch 480 x 854 resolution screen. A quad-core 1.2GHz spreadtrum SC7731 CPU drives the handset , which has 1GB of RAM inside. The phone offers 8GB of expandable storage and includes a rear-facing 8MP camera. Gracing the front of the device is a 2MP snapper that takes selfies and handles video chats. A 2000mAh battery keeps the engines purring and Android 4.4 comes on the unit right out of the box. The Desire 326G Dual SIM supports 3G, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. Thanks for the tip! source: Phonegyaan ( 1 ), ( 2 ). Two new HTC models launch in India. Two new HTC models launch in India.
