The Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 is the successor to the super-impressive, and similarly grammatically confused, Smart Ultra 6 – a high-spec budget phone that we were rather taken by when we reviewed it last year. And things are much the same this time around. Although you won’t find top-end specs in the Smart Ultra 7, there is enough decent hardware to provide snappy performance, and all for £135.. With the Smart Ultra 7, Vodafone has set its sights on undercutting competitors in the budget phone market. For example, the recently launched Moto G4 includes many of the same specifications, but costs £169. Of course, the catch is that you have to be on Vodafone, but unless you have a strong disliking for the network, it’s hardly a drawback, especially if it keeps the price low.. As OnePlus has consistently demonstrated, packing decent hardware into an affordable device is a winning formula (although, that $4 Indian smartphone could still ruin the whole thing for everyone ). So, does Vodafone’s latest offering manage to pull off the same trick of keeping the price low without skimping on quality. As it turns out, the answer is mostly.. It’s important to bear in mind the price when considering the Smart Ultra 7’s build quality and design. For £135, you’re not going to get the kind of refined finish seen on the Galaxy S7 or iPhone 6S. Vodafone’s handset is essentially a rebranded Alcatel phone that comes in an all-plastic case, with Dragontail glass – a cheaper alternative to Gorilla glass – covering the screen.You also have a choice of two, rather confusingly titled, colours: Satin Charcoal or Aluminium Silver.. The textured plastic backing is removable and feels distinctly Galaxy S5 -esque. It’s pretty flimsy and doesn’t look particularly sleek. Removing the backing is also a clunky way of changing SIM cards and inserting a microSD card, especially seeing as the battery isn’t removable.. Elsewhere, things look slightly more high-end. The plastic frame has a brushed metal-style finish on the edges of the phone, which at least creates the illusion of high-end design. That Dragontail glass also curves nicely as it reaches the edges of the screen, and the chrome finish around the home button adds an air of distinction to the whole affair.. Next to that home button you’ll find two backlit capacitive buttons, which in my opinion look a little outdated. There’s something about the lacklustre backlight that reminds me less of a slick top-end smartphone and more of the buttons you’d find on a cheap microwave.. At 150g and 152 x 78 x 9mm, the Smart Ultra 7 is firmly in Moto G4 territory. Lenovo’s device is slightly longer and thicker at 153 x 77 x 10mm, and it’s also a tad heavier at 155g. But overall, the form factors are similar. You’ll struggle to use the Smart Ultra 7 in one hand, and for me, when it comes to dimensions, I prefer my current handset, the OnePlus X , over Vodafone’s larger offering..

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. So, all in all, while you’re not getting the nicest-looking phone available, the Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 can at least pass for a well designed mid-range device. It’s only on closer inspection that the plastic casing and weird textured backing, volume, and power buttons become apparent. But I have to say, the phone certainly feels sturdy and well built in the hand – which is reassuring for a £135 smartphone.. The Smart Ultra 7 comes with a 5.5-inch 1080p screen, which equates to a 401ppi density. Those are exactly the same screen specs you’ll find on the Moto G4. With it’s smaller 5-inch screen, the OnePlus X offers a higher 441ppi density, which is to be expected with the reduced display size. All of which means that Vodafone has managed to match the best budget smartphones when it comes to screen specs.. In practice, these figures result in strikingly sharp pictures from the Smart Ultra 7. Although the screen isn’t going to wow you in the manner of the QHD display on the LG G5 or Galaxy S7, you won’t notice individual pixels on the Smart Ultra 7’s screen.. As with most IPS LCD panels, though, you will notice slight light bleed around the edges, and the blacks aren’t as deep as on the OnePlus X, which uses AMOLED display tech.. What’s more, the screen isn’t fully laminated to the glass, which means viewing angles aren’t quite as good as they could be. However, the screen here certainly isn’t like one of those cheap Twisted Nematic panels, where the picture goes dark unless you’re looking straight at it.. There’s also the bezel, which is thicker than you may have hoped, but no more so than the bezel on the OnePlus X or Moto G4. Even top-end phones continue to arrive with sizeable bezels, so I can’t begrudge Vodafone the hefty screen border too much.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

Vodafone has created another keenly priced smartphone that punches above its weight, but the Smart Ultra 7 launches into an increasingly competitive crowd.. The Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 hits the market at an interesting time. Here in the middle of 2016, we've reached the point where it's no longer a surprise when a really good, really cheap phone comes along.. The Moto G family set the tone several years ago, and we've since seen a whole bunch of top-value Chinese phones flood the low-end market.. Not to be undercut, UK mobile networks like EE and Vodafone have stepped up with surprisingly decent cheap efforts of their own. In fact, last year's Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 was one of the better sub-£150 phones of the year.. So how does its successor fare in an even more competitive market?. Costing just £135 on Pay As You Go, the Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 appears well equipped for the fight. It's got a decent lower-mid-range processor, a large and bright display, and a well-spec'd camera.. But as I've already said, this is an incredibly competitive market, with the Moto G4 resetting the parameters for what we expect from our affordable smartphones.. Vodafone's going to need to do something special once again with this year's effort - especially if it requires you to switch to the network from your current provider.. Vodafone's Smart Ultra 7 looks quite different to last year's model, despite essentially boiling down to the same combination of plastic and glass.. You get those faux-metal-effect plastic edges that are bafflingly common on this kind of phone. They're fine, and hard-wearing enough, but they can only ever really disappoint whenever you get within touching distance of the handset.. Around back, Vodafone has opted for a curious textured plastic finish. It's slightly pearlescent from a distance, and more than a little odd to look at close-up. The truth is, I'm still not sure whether I like it or not a week into my time with the phone - but at least it's a bit different from the norm.. The side power and volume buttons are pleasantly - or at least usefully - textured, so they're easy to distinguish and activate quickly by feel alone. Meanwhile, around front there are more changes from the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6.. It's pretty similar in a blank-slate, black-slab-of-glass kind of way, but the key area to focus on is just below the display. Whereas last year's model had a set of dedicated capacitive keys, the Smart Ultra 7 adds a physical home button.. In shape and function it's quite similar to the home button on the Samsung Galaxy S range - albeit with a slightly less satisfying click. It's a shame there's no similar double-click camera shortcut, though.. Either side of this home button you get the familiar back and recent apps capacitive keys. This serves to remove the functions from the UI itself, which means a diversion from the default setup for stock Android. Both approaches have their merits, and I can't say I have a massive preference either way.. At 150g the Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 sits nicely in the hand, and is actually 9g lighter than the Smart Ultra 6. However, a thickness of 8.7mm means it's a fraction chunkier. Still, it's both lighter and thinner than its big rival, the Moto G4 (which is 155g and 9.8mm thick).. On the bottom of the phone you get the standard micro USB port and a solitary, somewhat tinny speaker. The top edge simply contains a 3.5mm headphone jack.. And that's about it for external features. It's simultaneously a rather plain and slightly curious design, and one that fails to ignite much in the way of admiration. But it's perfectly functional, which is all you can really ask for in an affordable phone.. Next Page Key features.

A lack of truly standout features means the follow-up to the popular Smart Ultra 6 comes up short. Good specs for the price, impressive screen (to a point), uncluttered Android experience. Cheap design, poor camera performance and viewing angles, Vodafone only. THE VODAFONE SMART ULTRA 7, with its bargain bin price and decent specs, has the potential to outsmart its rivals.. After all, the Smart Ultra 6 was praised by tech tastemakers up and down the land in 2015, so it seems feasible that Vodafone can pull it off successfully again. Design The Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 is a bit like a bigger Galaxy S2 (remember that?) complete with textured back, only with cheaper materials. There's no luxurious brushed metal or Gorilla Glass, just an all-plastic case that adds to the fairly non-descript appearance.. It's bigger than the Vodafone Smart Platinum 7 at 152x78x8.7mm but weighs a none too heavy 150g. Despite the fair asking price it doesn't feel cheap, and it sits comfortably in the hand, although that 5.5in screen almost nudges it into phablet territory.. The big central button on the front doesn't hide a fingerprint scanner, but functions as a Home key. Either side are two capacitive buttons that light up when pressed, but we can't shake the feeling that they appear tacky.. Power and volume controls live on the handset's right side decorated in a fake textured metal. On the bottom, you'll find a USB 2.0 port and the phone's speaker enclosure. Sadly the speakers fail to reach the dizzy heights of those booming front-facing units on the pricier Smart Platinum 7.. The handset is available in Satin Charcoal or Aluminium Silver.. Performance and hardware Peering inside we find a MediaTek MT6755M CPU with four 1.8GHz and four 1GHz cores, backed with 2GB of RAM. The MediaTek chip also goes by another name, the Helio P10. You might know that as the brains behind the formidable Oppo F1 Plus, except that the Oppo uses faster clock speeds.. The Smart Ultra 7 scored 799 (single-core) and 3,022 (multi-core) in our Geekbench 3 tests. This compares favourably with the Moto G4 , which returned 713 and 2,947. It also beats the Obi Worldphone MV1 and Wileyfox Spark. As previously noted there's no fingerprint scanner like on its Smart Platinum 7 brother or NFC support..

Sony will sell its wireless 'open-ear' buds in the US. Vodafone's Smart Ultra 7 is another unremarkable refresh. Vodafone is back in Moto G territory with the Smart Ultra 7, an own-brand smartphone designed to replace the decent Smart Ultra 6 from last year. The new model is a smidge more expensive -- £135 on pay-as-you-go, rather than £125 -- but offers an ever-so-slightly more luxurious design. The Ultra 6's grey plastic shell has been swapped our for the same faux-leather look found on Vodafone's cheaper Smart Prime 7. It doesn't scream style, but neither will it attract much attention in a conference room.. Like the Ultra 6, the Ultra 7 comes with a 5.5-inch, 1080p display and 2GB of RAM. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 615 has been swapped out for an octa-core MediaTek processor -- we're not sure if that's an improvement -- and the battery has been trimmed from 3,000mAh to 2,960mAh. Any perceivable leaps in performance will, therefore, be marginal, although we found the Ultra 6 to be snappy enough last year. Provided you're not playing intensive games like Asphalt 8: Airbone , you'll probably be okay.. The best part of the Ultra 7 is, arguably, the software experience. Like the Ultra 6 and its popular competitor, the Moto G, the latest Vodafone handset runs a near-stock version of Android. You'll get 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box with no whacky wallpapers, icon packs or menu customisations of note. It's the experience Google intended, albeit with a few (nine at my count) Vodafone apps thrown into the mix. While these are still a nuisance, they're a small price to pay in comparison to other, more overbearing Android modifications slapped on by countless phone manufacturers.. The Ultra 7 is a logical, if unexciting successor to the Ultra 6. (A trend for Vodafone, it seems, after the Smart Prime 7 and Smart First 7 .) It's worth looking at, especially if Vodafone is your network of choice in the UK. Given its enterprise-ready design, however, we suspect it's been developed with the workplace in mind. The phone seems a good fit for well-paid executives who want to quickly equip dozens, if not thousands of workers with a respectable Android smartphone. It's not a flagship contender like the Smart Platinum 7 , but it should be more than capable of handling email, calls, texts and the usual repertoire of social media apps.. gadgetry , gadgets , gear , mobile , smartultra7 , vodafone. at Engadget, covering video games, internet culture. and anything else that takes his fancy.

Press enter or click on the search icon. Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 - Software and Performance. Page 1 Vodafone Smart Ultra 7. Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 – Software. Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 – Performance. Vodafone has loaded the Smart Ultra 7 with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow , and it’s done so without cramming in too much bloatware. In fact, Marshmallow remains virtually untouched, save for the handful of Vodafone apps that come pre-installed.. Bloatware is one of my biggest issues with any device, whether it be a computer, tablet, or smartphone. Consumers don’t like to be overwhelmed by random pop-ups and requests from programs that seemingly do the same thing as the stock software.. While Vodafone has been fairly charitable when it comes to showing restraint with bloatware on the Smart Ultra 7, it’s still present – lurking and poised to irritate. Vodafone apps include: the company’s calling and messaging alternatives; Accessories, which is just an excuse to get you to buy more stuff; Start; Updates; and the ever-helpful Tips app.. Those unfamiliar with touchscreen phones might find the Tips app useful, but for the most part, Android works perfectly well without these apps and it’s best to just ignore them.. To its credit, though, Vodafone has provided an almost untouched version of Google’s mobile OS, and the phone is all the better for it. Marshmallow is a great OS and it’s allowed to shine unimpeded on the Smart Ultra 7.. When it comes to specs, the Smart Ultra 7 isn’t going to blow you away, but it does manage to pack in hardware that promises stable, and even speedy performance. The 1.0GHz/1.8GHz octa-core MediaTek MT6755M CPU is no Snapdragon 820, but it does the job well enough that you won’t notice slowdown of any kind.. Alongside the CPU, there’s 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. It’s worth noting that the 16GB actually works out to about 9.8GB once you factor in the stock apps and system memory. In comparison, the Moto G4 comes with the same amount of RAM and either 16 or 32GB of internal storage, while the OnePlus X comes with 3GB of RAM and 16GB internal storage.. One plus point here is that you can upgrade the internal storage of Vodafone’s handset with a microSD card – something that both the Moto G4 and OnePlus X also offer.. Using the Smart Ultra 7 is, for the most part, a trouble-free experience. You might notice a slight pause when loading certain apps: my review model took a few seconds to load Chrome. But, on the whole, everything works fluidly. Gaming is similarly smooth: the handset ran the graphically intense Asphalt 8 without a hitch – although it does become a little warm during the process.. In terms of benchmarking, the Smart Ultra’s chip held up well in the Geekbench 3 multi-core stakes, rolling in with a score of 3,094. That’s in comparison to the Moto G4’s 3,190 and the OnePlus X’s 2,542, which makes the Smart Ultra just as good as, if not better than in some instances, the competition when it comes to performance..

Huawei’s £169 Honour 5X , which offers another great budget smartphone experience, does include a fingerprint scanner; however, it’s unusual on a smartphone costing £135.. On the plus side, Vodafone has provided an NFC chip with the Smart Ultra 7, meaning you’ll be able to get fully acquainted with Android Pay if you invest in its device..

We’ve spent some time with the Vodafone Smart Ultra 7, and here’s what we think. Read next: Best Android smartphone of 2016. Also see: Best Black Friday Phone Deals. So before we go any further, just how expensive is the Vodafone Smart Ultra 7? The Smart Ultra 7 was designed to be a budget smartphone that allows more people to use 4G (notable Vodafone’s 4G network, but you could probably get it unlocked) and as such, has a price tag to match. The Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 will set consumers back £135 on Pay as you Go, while Vodafone is also offering it on contract - £19 PCM will get you the smartphone along with 500 minutes, unlimited texts and 500MB of data.. The Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 can be considered a visual upgrade over the Smart Ultra 6 if nothing more. The Ultra 7 sports the same brushed metal body with a removable plastic rear, but with a few added details. For example, the plain-looking plastic rear cover has been upgraded and is clad in a rather intricate design, and while this isn’t ground-breaking, it does make a slightly bland looking phone a little bit more appealing.. In fact, we’d argue that the 5.5in Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 doesn’t look like a sub-£150 smartphone at all. While it doesn’t have the build quality of high-end smartphones like, say, the iPhone 6s or Samsung Galaxy S7 , it could definitely compete with mid-range smartphones in terms of design.. Why? For one, it’s fairly lightweight for a large budget smartphone, weighing in at 150g. It’s slightly thicker than its predecessor at 152.2 x 78.21 x 8.68mm, but is still thinner than the similarly priced EE Harrier (8.9mm) and EE Harrier Mini. The curved edges of the Smart Ultra 7 are dual purpose – as well as improving the aesthetics of the smartphone, it also provides users with a smartphone that’s comfortable to use over long periods, an important aspect to consider when buying a smartphone with a large display.. The Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 is available to purchase in Silver and the slightly darker ‘Dark Grey’, both featuring black bezels around the edges of the display. The build quality is generally quite good, although we’ve noticed that the plastic rear case doesn’t sit completely flush with the camera and while it’s not a huge deal, it’s worth pointing out.. The first thing you’ll notice about the Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 is the display – a beautiful 5.5in Full HD (1080x1920) IPS display, with a pixel density of around 401ppi. The display, although unchanged from the Ultra 6, is still pretty impressive for a smartphone with a price tag of £135, especially when you consider that similarly priced budget smartphones feature a 720p display. It’s crisp and vibrant, and we don’t really have any complaints about it – sure, it may not be the most visible in direct sunlight but for such a cheap smartphone, we’re not too fussed.. So if the display is still the same, what has changed? The internals – but we’re not sure if it’s for the better, if our benchmark results are anything to go by. On paper, it looks like the Smart Ultra 7 has had an upgrade – the Ultra 6 featured a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor comprised of one quad-core 1.5Ghz A53 and one quad-core 1.0Ghz A53 core, while the Ultra 7 features an octa-core Mediatek MT6755M processor, comprised of one quad-core 1.8GHz A53 and one 1.0GHz A53 core. Both feature 2GB of RAM and while the Smart Ultra 6 features an Adreno 405 GPU, the Smart Ultra 7 features a Mali-T860 GPU.. However, when we compared our benchmark results to the Smart Ultra 6, we were fairly surprised. As you can see from the chart below, the Smart Ultra 7 came out worse in both GFXBench tests, although it bested the year-old Smart Ultra 6 in the GeekBench 3 results. The Smart Ultra 7 scored 5.3fps in Manhattan while the Smart Ultra 6 scored 5.7fps, and the Smart Ultra 7 scored 13fps while the Smart Ultra 6 scored 14fps.. GeekBench 3 changes the tide for the Smart Ultra 7 though, as the Ultra 7 bested the 6 by quite a bit, scoring 3002 compared to the 2469 offering of the Ultra 6. We can’t compare JetStream test results, which test the browser speed, as we were using a different method of testing when we reviewed the Smart Ultra 6, but the Smart Ultra 7 scored an impressive (for its price) 22.6.. The Smart Ultra 7 features 16GB of internal storage and while that is okay for some, those of you that require a bit more space will be happy to learn that much like the Smart Ultra 6, the Smart Ultra 7 also features a MicroSD card slot. The MicroSD card slot allows Smart Ultra 7 users to expand their built-in storage by up to 128GB.. The smartphone also features a 2960mAh battery, but even though the rear plate is removable, the battery itself isn’t. The smartphone doesn’t feature any kind of fast-charging technology either, which means it does take a while to charge the high-capacity battery, although battery life is generally okay, lasting us the day without any real issue. We’ll run a battery test in the coming days and let you know the results soon!. Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices.

Tags Phones Smart Ultra 7 Vodafone. In need of a new phone but don't want to break the bank? Find out how the brand new Vodafone Smart ultra 7 marries top-end specs with an amazingly low price tag.... In 2015, Cnet senior editor Luke Westaway said that the Smart ultra 6 punched “above its weight when it comes to its on-board components,” while TrustedReviews called it “a seriously disruptive phone.”. The ultra 6 found favour with heaps of top tech reviewers, in fact, but we’re not resting on our laurels –. we’ve decided to truly raise the bar with its successor, the Smart ultra 7 – available right now. But what makes it special? Read on to find out…. Price on Pay As You Go: £135. Made for: Savvy streamers, gamers, texters and social media moguls. Great because: It’s got all-round performance at an incredible price. So what’s underneath the Smart ultra 7’s precision metal and glass chassis? Well, behind its full HD 5.5-inch display beats a similar octa-core processor to the platinum 7, along with a 2960mAh battery, and 16GB of expandable storage.. At 5-and-13-Megapixels respectively, its rear and front-facing cameras are more than capable of taking immensely detailed shots, especially as the front camera also has a flash and – like the platinum 7 – it all runs on Android 6.0.. But by far the best thing is its price. While this kind of tech is traditionally locked behind a high price bracket, the Smart ultra 7 can be yours for just £135 on Vodafone Pay As You Go, making it an absolute steal and great choice for any price conscious tech fans who don’t want to miss out on the latest and greatest mobile experiences..

Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 Review: In Depth. Screen size 5.5-inches Screen resolution Full HD (1920x1080) Weight 150 grams OS Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow Rear Camera 13-megapixels Front camera 5-megapixels w/ flash Processor 1.0GHz/1.8GHz octa-core MediaTek MT6755M Memory 2GB RAM Storage 16GB. Expandable via microSD up to 32GB 4G LTE Yes Bonus features Vodafone Call+ & Message+ apps. Slimmer and lighter than predecessor Clean Android experience Affordable. Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 review: We were wowed by Vodafone’s 2015 flagship last year, but can the follow-up rekindle that same success?. Versus the Ultra 6 , the 7 is lighter and tighter across all of its dimensions. There are more considered elements like curved surface glass on the front, a textured, patterned back with centrally justified camera placement and more tactile hardware controls along the side, but despite all this, it doesn’t feel like it’s punching above its price point.. Beyond the cover glass, the Ultra 7 features an all-plastic build with a removable back plate that (if you manage to prise it off) lets you get at the SIM tray and microSD card slot, but keeps the battery locked away. There’s a single speaker grille at the base, which doesn’t readily get obscured and a mix of capacitive keys and a physical home button on the front that give the Ultra 7 the look of a OnePlus 3 or a Samsung Galaxy Note , boasting more sophisticated white backlighting in place of the Ultra 6’s blue offerings.. Like last year’s phone, you’ll find a 5.5-inch IPS LCD that’s actually very pretty. There’s plenty of punch on offer with accurate looking colours, but whilst it doesn’t dim at more extreme angles, it does suffer from a little colour distortion, particularly with regards to whites, not to mention overall brightness could be better.. With Full HD resolution at your fingertips and 401 pixels per inch, the display is thankfully well-suited for enjoying media and the cover glass is relatively smudge repellent which helps too.. As with the rest of Vodafone’s 2016 lineup, the Ultra 7 runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow out the box with the network’s typical fare of own-brand apps added in. Thankfully the bloatware isn’t that heavy, most of it you can uninstall or avoid installing to begin with and some of the tweaks Voda’s made are actually quite useful. Beyond that, the 7 actually feels near enough like stock Android, so it should look familiar if you’re coming from the majority of other Android devices out there.. For all the tweaks for things like shortcuts and task management, one oversight has to be the lack of a one-handed mode, which on a phone with a 5.5-inch display, isn’t ideal, but with Android Pay compatibility and the lightweight alternations Vodafone’s made, the Prime 7 looks and feels clean and tidy to use.. General performance seems usable too, although in the tough affordable market that the Ultra 7 inhabits, perhaps not quite as snappy as we’d have liked. The octa-core MediaTek chipset and 2GB of RAM do struggle when pressed with extensive multitasking or gaming, usually resulting in a few dropped frames and longer app load times, but there’s enough power for the phone’s everyday functionality.. Whilst the phone is listed as boasting 16GB of internal storage, only 9.77GB of that is actually user accessible and with microSD support only going up to 32GB on top, versus the competition, there really isn’t a huge amount of room to throw media around on the Ultra 7.. The phone’s also another low-cost 4G capable offering, with decent Cat 4 LTE speeds at your disposal, as well as the aforementioned NFC for mobile payments. It’s all powered by a 3000mAh battery too, which does a respectable job of doling out a day and a half’s worth of use before giving up the ghost.. It’s the cameras that often suffer first when there’s a low price tag attached to a phone and whilst they aren’t abysmal, there’s certainly room for improvement with the snappers on the Ultra 7. We’re fans of the software, which offers a clearly laid out interface with some smart touches like a gesture-controlled shutter.. Selfie lovers will appreciate the front-facing LED flash attached to the forward-facing 5-megapixel camera, however out the box, ours was pretty much useless, misfiring out of time with the shutter so dark shots remained dark (Vodafone is now working on a fix though).. The main camera meanwhile packs a few more pixels, with a 13-megapixel sensor, and does a decent job of capturing something in all conditions, even low light. HDR in high-contrast scenarios is also effective, but the common issue across both the front and rear cameras is fine detail.. Shots taken from the phone appear a little muddy and there looks to be heavy-handed image processing at play that tries to hide the lack of fine detail with excessive smoothing. On social media, the cameras on the Ultra 7 get the job done, but only just.. In the plus column you do get Full HD video recording with optional image stabilisation, but just don’t expect miracles, especially with regards to audio quality.. Clean software and an attractive, (albeit plastic) design don’t save the Ultra 7 from feeling a little underpowered out the gate. It doesn’t feel like all that much of an upgrade, particularly down to the slow hardware elements, but at £135 it’s hard to bash this attractive 4G phone too much.. We’d, however, more readily put our money in the fractionally pricier (£149). Honor 5C , which boasts notably better performance and better cameras by comparison.. Vodafone Smart V8 Review: In Depth.

The OG Pebble: A Dead Product But Is It Still Worth It?. Top 5 Smartwatches of The Year 2017…So Far. Home / Reviews / Smartphone Reviews / Review: Vodafone Smart Ultra 7. 13MP rear camera – 1080p @ 30fps, with flash. Once again thank you to Vodafone for sending me a unit out for review and this time it’s the Vodafone Smart Ultra 7. This is another device in their self-branded range of devices. Coming in at £135 it is the second most expensive in the line up for this year. Lets see what £135 gets you.. As usual lets get the specs out of the way.. Cracking open the box open the first thing you’re greeted with is the device itself. Pulling the phone out you are find a little envelope with all the paperwork inside of it. Pulling that out you’ll then find a smaller box with the USB cable, wall plug, and a set of earbuds. Nice to see Vodafone throwing some earbuds in. However on the flip side my unit came with a European 2 pin plug and no UK one.. front of the device, on the bottom you’ll find the back, home and multitasking buttons. One thing to note is the home button is a physical button where as the other two are capacitive buttons. Now personally I dislike the home button with a passion and I’d prefer a capactive button like on the First 7 and Prime 7. Up top there is the front facing flash, speaker and the camera.. Spinning it around to the right you find the volume rocker and power button which both have a nice texture to them. Whilst this is generally fine, but to have the textured finish across both the Volume rocker and the Power button means any increased in the ability to find the buttons without a glance is lost and is kind of annoying. The buttons are ever so slightly. tactile but they certainly get the job done. Spinning around to left hand side you find nothing. Heading to the bottom of the device you find the micro USB port, speaker and a microphone. that the the micro USB port is on the far left hand side and the speaker is located in the middle. The problem with this is that the speaker gets covered too easily which is obviously inconvenient. So is the micro USB, which is rather odd to grip when a cable is plugged in. Heading up to the top of the phone you’ll find another microphone and the 3.5mm headphone jack.. Finally around the back you’ll find a plastic back with. a pretty pattern (which is the same design as on the other phones from Vodafone) as well as the camera hump and flash. It’s not a small hump as well, which is annoying and also means that the top of the device slides around way to much when on a flat surface.. As you might have expected the 13MP camera does a pretty average job at best with the stills but like I said in other Vodafone device reviews, they are budget devices so don’t expect an excellent camera. I mean it could be used to take a picture for insurance purposes and I suppose if you were out you could use it to take a picture of something but it’s not Galaxy S7 class and nor should it be at this price point. The front facing 5MP is a. Even with that front facing flash.. Like with stills the camera still doesn’t do all that great. Sure its OK and can just about replace and a regular point and shoot but if you like a high quality photo this isn’t a replacement. Take a look for yourself and comment what you think.. As I mentioned earlier the speaker is located in the middle of the device and it makes it ridiculously easily to cover it up. You can add in the fact it gets to half volume and sounds like its being shoved into a glass.. rather quiet on the first notch and too loud on the second notch. It really isn’t nice to use. Definitely a headphone or speaker job here, no ifs or buts.. The display however is something that I quite like about this phone. display, which if you don’t already know, my daily driver is a 6P and I like bigger phones so this is fine for me. The colours are also fine and viewing angles are great. Heck I actually enjoyed watching YouTube videos, Twitch streams and just general use on it.. Running the GeekBench3 battery test the Ultra 7 managed to score a very good score with the screen dimmed at 50% brightness delivering a battery length of over 5 hours, which is actually pretty damn good. I’ve also managed to conduct the usual “daily use” test during my working day.. The test is conducted by having the device idle for 3 hours then used just lightly to moderately in the evening. I got about 10-12 hours on battery. Not bad, I could live with that.. The benchmarks scores were not bad coming in at 768 and 3021 respectively. In real world test it was fine, I had no problem at all. Multi-tasking was fine, it never stuttered at all during switching. Though I did go into developer options and turn the animation speed down too 0.5x. but that seems to be something I do on every phone at the moment and is purely a personal thing.. The million dollar question is should you buy the Ultra 7? Being honest I kind of want to say no. It’s not that it is a bad phone, believe me it actually isn’t. It’s a nice phone but it just feels like a little bit of a beefed up Prime 7 (read my review here ) and I much preferred the Prime 7. that the Prime doesn’t have that stupid physical button is just a bonus. Add in the fact that the speaker is harder to cover up on the Prime 7 and it really does have my vote above the Ultra 7. The Prime 7 is also only £75, and that is quite a saving.. To be brutally honest the Smart Ultra 7 just left me feeling a little underwhelmed. In fact it took me longer to write this review than normal because it could have been easier to simply write “buy the Prime 7” instead of everything I have done, because like I said this just left me feeling like it could have offered more.. To wrap up, it’s not a bad phone, it’s just that it doesn’t offer enough to be an Ultra version when a Prime exists.. Plastic build could put some off. Has a stupid physical home button. Micro USB port is placed in the far right hand side. Speaker is the middle and to easy to cover up. Tags review Ultra 7 vodafone. Techie, Biker, Gamer, RC Stockcar racer.

Posted from Vodafone Smart Ultra 6. Vodafone turkey yesterday brought out the updated versions of the smart ultra phone, the smart ultra 7 and smart pro 7. Vodafone ireland has updated the smart prime and smart first phones from last years versions in the last month. I was wondering if there is any news on a release date for Ireland and a pricing on the smart pro 7 and smart ultra 7? Last years smart ultra 6 was a great phone and judging by the new phone specs this years updated versions will be even better. If the pricing is done right these could be a real crowd pleaser like last year. Did zte make this years versions aswell?. Message 1 of 6. Re: Vodafone smart ultra 7 and smart pro 7. We've no news on these handsets as yet, but any updates will be added to this page:. Learn all about our new forum, right here. To send me a private message, simply click here Please include a link to your thread when sending these over - due to the volume of queries, PMs without a thread link will not be answered.. Message 2 of 6. Re: Vodafone smart ultra 7 and smart pro 7. Posted from Vodafone Smart Ultra 6. I hear 20th of June as the release date for the Vodafone smart platinum in the UK anyway. This is the pro 7 in Turkey. Will it be released on this date in Ireland. It costs £300 so any word on pricing in Ireland? Specs are top of the range and I will definitely be interested in purchasing this phone. Message 3 of 6. Re: Vodafone smart ultra 7 and smart pro 7. Keep an eye on here: http://vodafone.ie/comingsoon This is where it'll be announced first.. Cookie Vodafone Community Expert (or so I'm told) and S8 owner. Message 4 of 6. Re: Vodafone smart ultra 7 and smart pro 7. I have bought and received the Ultra 7 this week from the Vodafone online store for €179.99. Does not appear to be in the shops right now.. Good phone, so fast and feels like a good quality phone.. No accessories available yet, which is a pity as I wanted a folio case for it.. Has a physical middle button which is nice to have.. Message 5 of 6. Re: Vodafone smart ultra 7 and smart pro 7. Posted from Vodafone Smart Ultra 6. Both are now available as of yesterday.I think I will be updating my Vodafone smart ultra 6 to the Vodafone smart platinum 7 with its flagship specs over the summer. The smart ultra 7 isnt a big enough upgrade from the smart ultra 6 for me.. Message 6 of 6.

Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 unboxing and hands-on review. Vodafone’s Ultra is back for 2016, with the new Smart Ultra 7 – a respectable high-end mid-ranger with 4G LTE, an expansive Full HD screen and a pair of promising snappers.. We say ‘high-end mid-ranger’ as the new Smart Platinum 7 has raised the bar on what Vodafone classes as a flagship device, but you still get plenty of bang for your buck with the Smart Ultra 7, which launched on PAYG for £135 on Monday.. Much like the Platinum 7 , the Ultra adopts a more refined box design than the likes of the Smart Prime 7, with a grey finish accented by a wireframe illustration of the phone. The box also highlights some of the key hardware and software features and points you to a dedicated webpage, where you can explore the phone further.. Lift the lid and the phone is the first thing that greets you. Powered off, the introduction of a physical home button gives it a similar appearance to Samsung’s Galaxy Note 2 , however, look closer and you’ll spot the backlit iconography of the capacitive keys either side.. The 5.5-inch Full HD LCD is skirted by thin bezels, above the screen sits a 5-megapixel front-facing camera with a dedicated LED flash and underneath the removable back, you’ll find slots for a microSIM and a microSD card, letting you bolster the phone’s 16GB of integrated storage.. Underneath the phone is a card holder containing a quick-start guide and all the necessary warranty information, leaving only the essential accessories yet to open up. In the next compartment within the Ultra 7’s box, you’ll find in-ear headphones with an inline microphone and one-button remote, although they only offer one pair of buds, so they won’t necessarily fit all ear shapes. There’s also a power adapter and a microUSB to USB lead for charging, however, the jump from a Qualcomm to a MediaTek chipset between the Ultra 6. and the Ultra 7 means there isn’t even the possibility of fast charging functionality.. The phone packs an octa-core MediaTek MT6755M processor, backed up by 2GB of RAM, a 13-megapixel primary camera and a 2960mAh battery too. Stay tuned for our full review soon..

There’s now four own-branded smartphones in the Vodafone armoury. We looked at the entry-level Vodafone Smart first 7 the other day and we’ve reviewed the mid-range Vodafone Smart prime 7. Now it’s the turn of the Vodafone Smart ultra 7. However, if you want an even higher-spec smartphone, don’t forget the new Vodafone platinum 7 that we reviewed just yesterday .. Think about what Vodafone are trying to do here. This has top-end specs and you can get it on contract from £19 a month with no up-front fee. On Pay As You Go it’s just £135. Basically, this is Vodafone saying, “Hey, this is a really, really good smartphone, but it won’t cost you a fortune”.. The specs are really rather good. There’s a 13 megapixel camera at the back with auto-focus and an LED flash. Up front, a 5 megapixel selfie cam. It’s powered by an octa-core Mediatek MT6755M CPU – that’s four 1.8 GHz cores and four 1 GHz ones. There’s a Malu T860MP2 GPU and it runs Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow). The screen is the same size as my LG G4 but not quite as high-res. The display on this one is a 1080 x 1920 pixel (401 ppi) 5.5″ model but there’s a tiny bit more chassis to deal with. It’s a smidge taller (at 152.2mm) than my G4 (at 149mm) but actually thiner – the ultra 7 is 8.7 mm thick compared to the 9.8mm thickness of the G4. The ultra 7 is also a very tiny bit wider, but not enough to notice.. Build quality? Yeah, not bad actually. No fancy slots in the side for your SIM and microSD – it’s old school “back off” time. The battery is glued in there and the 2960 mAh unit isn’t coming out in a hurry. Your SIM and microSD slide in here. The back has a grippy finish and it’s a flexible, bendy cover which clicks into place easily. A hole is left for that 13 megapixel camera.. The front is a polished and curvy affair, with the rather lovely front panel sloping off at the edges in a very natual and uninterupted way.. The top houses that 5 megapixel camera, which also has a flash (I’ve just blinded myself testing it, so I can attest to its brightness) and, at the bottom, a rather please “clicking” home button (which also wakes the device if you press it). This has a small back-lit symbol and there’s back-lit “back” and “menu” buttons either side too. The specs-list for this includes NFC, WiFi, GPS, an FM radio and 16GB of on-board storage which you can add to with that microSD card slot around the back.. The bottom and the edges of this phone are rounded metallic material and, although I can’t tell you just how much (if any) of this phone is metal, it certainly adds a fair amount of classiness to it. Down here you can see the microUSB charging point, a grill for the external speaker and the main microphone. There’s another microphone up top for noise cancellation.. Up here at the top you’ll also find the 3.5mm audio port.. The right side has the volume and power button. You don’t need to press this and you can use the front “home” button to wake the device, but it’s nice to see a different finish on the keys to differentate them – you can locate them purely by feel.. Inside things do indeed rattle along with quite some speed. It’s a rather plesant and familiar experience, but with some surprising additions. Take the screen brightness as an example. I wanted to adjust it (it’ll get brighter or darker depending on the surrounding conditions) but then I drilled down and found a whole host of screen options. Wanna adjust the contrast? The saturation level? The sharpness? Bloody hell. Is this an advanced TV? Wait a minute, there’s a colour temperature option too, and – blow me down – it’s even the correct UK English spelling (colour, not color). That gives me a little smile in a special place that does.. What’s this? Dynamic contrast? I’ve no real idea what that does but I’m gonna play. (It basically blows out white detail and destroys black detail from what I’ve seen).. You can also swipe right on the home screen to open your favourite app (and they put “favourite”, not “favorite” – I’m smiling again. You can also do a similar thing and set a favourite app to open with the aid of lock screen shortcuts.. You can tweak how long the touch keys stay on for, whether you want a pulse notification LED, which notification content to show. You can also setup Android Tap & Pay here or head into the memory and internal storage status screens. That 16GB of storage, by the way, instantly turns into 9.85GB once you.. You can also, if you wish, find out just who makes this. It’s a company called TCL Communications. They’re in Tower 3, 33 Canton Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong. You probably don’t need to know this but the sheer fact they’ve put that in shows an extreme attention to detail.. Inside you’ll also find an app called “Outlook” which heralds from a company called “Microsoft” who once made their own phones and their own Operating System (please don’t send hate mail, I’m trying to inject a bit of humour here). This can handle POP mail and my Gmail account too. I found myself liking it quite a bit, and I also noticed just how nippy that on-screen keyboard was. You can also tie in storage accounts (like Dropbox) and it’ll handle multiple email accounts – Exchange, Yahoo, iCloud, IMAP, Office365 and Outlook.. In addition, there’s all the Google bits. Play Music, Chrome, Play Movies, Books, Photos, Drive and Maps. You can of course to to Google Play and grab games a-plenty. It’ll also sync your contacts, appointments and email via the “cloud”.. Out of the box you can choose to turn on the Vodafone hints that’ll guide you around the phone. You also get some other special additions from Vodafone – Message+ and Call+ – These systems let you do a lot from a web browser, so you can use the Call+ and Message+ system to send and receive chat and text messages. You can also share photos, locations, stickers and emoticons. Call+ will let you “prepare” calls by sending location information and other important bits ahead of time. I can see why they’re doing it (WhatsApp is robbing the networks of lots of call / text / MMS revenue) and it works quite well.. The camera is pretty fully featured and has a manual setting so that you can fiddle around with white balance, ISO settings and more besides. Like other phone cameras, the full resolution (13 megapixels here) will be in 4:3 format and you’ll need to go down to 9 megapixels to get a “wide” 16:9 photo. There’s the ability to touch-focus, stablise images, turn on HDR, add a timer, engage a “night” mode and – when you click on an area to focus – you can adjust the brightness by pressing, holding and dragging up or down on the focus point.. Here’s some shots I’ve taken in a range of conditions... Yes, OK, there’s not the “brand power” you get with the likes of Samsung or iPhone. The metal and the glass isn’t quite there and you won’t have the massive range of covers and accessories for this but…. £135 on Pay As You Go?. Apart from the ever-so-slightly-lower-resolution screen (and I’m picking at flies here, because the 1080 x 1920 pixel unit on here is still vivid, bright and sharp), this is right up there with phones that cost £400 or more. Latest version of Android? It’s there. Decent, quick camera? Yeah, it’s decent enough.. OK, if I’m to pick on anything I’d have to point out that the CPU struggled a little under heavy multi-tasking (such as updating 15 Android Apps at once) and the camera isn’t fantastic in low light but, other than that, I’m honestly stuggling to find things wrong with this. I find myself recommending it quite highly, and sticking this into a file marked “Disrupting the smartphone market”. Why? Well, phones like this – phones that are made by some relatively unknown manufacturer in China and then branded by a network – they used to be hit and miss. Now they’re increasingly becoming hit and hit.. Get it from £19 on contract or £135 on Pay As You Go .. There's now four own-branded smartphones in the Vodafone armoury. We looked at the entry-level Vodafone Smart first 7 the other day and we've reviewed the mid-range Vodafone Smart prime 7. Now it's the turn of the Vodafone Smart ultra 7. However, if you want an even higher-spec smartphone, don't forget the new Vodafone platinum 7 that we reviewed just yesterday. Think about what Vodafone are trying to do here. This has top-end specs and you can get it on contract from £19 a month with no up-front fee. On Pay As You Go it's just £135. Basically, this is Vodafone saying, "Hey, this is a really, really good smartphone, but it won't cost you a fortune". The specs are really rather good. There's a 13 megapixel camera at the back with auto-focus and an LED flash. Up front, a 5 megapixel selfie cam. It's powered by an octa-core Mediatek MT6755M CPU - that's four 1.8 GHz cores and four 1 GHz ones. There's a Malu T860MP2 GPU and it runs Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow). The screen is the same size as my LG G4 but not quite as high-res. The display on this one is a 1080 x 1920 pixel (401 ppi) 5.5" model but there's a tiny bit more chassis to deal with. It's a smidge taller (at 152.2mm) than my G4 (at 149mm) but actually thiner - the ultra 7 is 8.7 mm thick compared to the 9.8mm thickness of the G4. The ultra 7 is also a very tiny bit wider, but not enough to notice. Build quality? Yeah, not bad actually. No fancy slots in the side for your SIM and microSD - it's old school "back off" time. The battery is glued in there and the 2960 mAh unit isn't coming out in a hurry. Your SIM and microSD slide in here. The back has a grippy finish and it's a flexible, bendy cover which clicks into place easily. A hole is left for that 13 megapixel camera. The front is a polished and curvy affair, with the rather lovely front panel sloping off at the edges in a very natual and uninterupted way. The top houses that 5 megapixel camera, which also has a flash (I've just blinded myself testing it, so I can attest to its brightness) and, at the bottom, a rather please "clicking" home button (which also wakes the device if you press it). This has a small back-lit symbol and there's back-lit "back" and "menu" buttons either side too. The specs-list for this includes NFC, WiFi, GPS, an FM radio and 16GB of on-board storage which you can add to with that microSD card slot around the back. The bottom and the edges of this phone are rounded metallic material and, although I can't tell you just how much (if any) of this phone is metal, it certainly adds a fair amount of classiness to it. Down here you can see the microUSB…. Vodafone Smart ultra 7 – Review. Vodafone Smart ultra 7 – Review. Vodafone Smart ultra 7 Review 89.

This nethod will break OTA, so for update you must use SUGAR. 1) Download TWRP and SPFT from my PAGE and place it on desktop. 2) Download these files and put them on your SD CARD: SuperSU_1 and SuperSU_2. 3) Turn off your phone and run SP FLASH TOOL. 3) When the SP FLASH TOOL starts, select MT6755 scatter file and MTK_AllinOne_DA.bin file (they are in SPFT folder). 4) Select ONLY recovery and load the TWRP_3.X.X file. (X.X means a version of TWRP). 6) Connect your powered off phone to PC via USB cable. 7) After flashing the TWRP, hold VOLUME UP + POWER to boot into TWRP. 8) In TWRP press "INSTALL" and flash the boot patch - SUPERSU_1 and then flash root - SUPERSU_2.

Have been trying to figure out the best way root this phone for two weeks now, and trying to avoid KingRoot all this time. Can you replace the KingRoot Binaries and Root Management Tools with the SuperSU ones?. Will Xposed Framework work on this phone? Really want AdAway, Greenify and Xposed Tweaks on the Vodafone Smart Ultra 7. You can replace kingroot with supersu thanks to this app:. I did not try the xposed yet. Join Date: Joined: Aug 2016. I still feel skeptical about KingRoot, and there are reports that indicate that replacing KingRoot with SuperSU isn't that easy either, KingRoot seems to completely deny root once altered or removed, which makes it look even more shady, I really want root on this phone, there are tweaks I would love to do such as dpi change, remove the vodafone label on the statusbar and more, but I don't know if I'm willing to use KingRoot in the process. I'm used to SuperSU and Xposed Framework working flawlessly, so I'm really 'scared' on this one. Join Date: Joined: Dec 2015. Not working on my ultra 7. Join Date: Joined: Aug 2016. Xposed Framework? Or root in general? (KingRoot). Not working on my ultra 7. Join Date: Joined: Dec 2015. After enabling USB debugging and unknown sources, I click "try to root" and then get the "Failed to root" screen. Xposed Framework? Or root in general? (KingRoot). Join Date: Joined: Aug 2016. I guess we'll have to wait for further development on the phone, I won't put my phone trough KingRoot, and you even reported that it isn't working for you... Really wanted root on this phone, lets hope someone actually picks it up just as they did with the previous model (Smart Prime 6 / Smart Ultra 6).. After enabling USB debugging and unknown sources, I click "try to root" and then get the "Failed to root" screen. Join Date: Joined: Oct 2013. İt did not work for me too ı hope a way can be found for rooting otherwise i desperately regret to bought this phone. Join Date: Joined: Aug 2016. Don't give up just yet, I do understand your desperation, as I feel almost the same as you, but you'll see someone will find a way, at least I hope... This phone its awesome for its price point, and would be absolutely marvelous with all the tweaks and adjustments root brings to the table. Who knows, maybe we'll have a full developed phone (custom ROMs, root, recovery, all of that good stuff), we can only wish someone works on it.... İt did not work for me too ı hope a way can be found for rooting otherwise i desperately regret to bought this phone. The Following User Says Thank You to skullbo For This Useful Post: [ View ].
