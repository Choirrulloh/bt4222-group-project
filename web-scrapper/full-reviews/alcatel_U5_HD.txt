The new Alcatel U5 HD sports a 5-inch display with HD (720p) resolution, an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera, and a secondary 5-megapixel selfie snapper. The original model has a 5-inch display with 480 x 854 pixels resolution, and much smaller 5MP and 2MP cameras. Otherwise, much of the specs inside are similar - the same MediaTek MT6737 processor, coupled with 1GB RAM and 8GB expandable storage. Moreover, the U5 HD is powered by a slightly 2,200 mAh battery..

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Features: Flash, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR). Quad-core, 1100 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm.

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 4.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 8.3 days (200 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 7, 8, 20.

Negative: Weak hardware; short battery life; easy getting fingerprints; poor cameras. Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 11/24/2017. This is a typical smartphone diagonal.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. The former French manufacturer of telecommunication equipment merged to Alcatel-Lucent in 2006. Several business segments were sold to other companies, so the Alcatel brand is now used by various companies. The Chinese company TCL uses the brand names "Alcatel One Touch" and "Alcatel Idol" for smartphones and tablets.. The market share in the smartphone + tablet segment is very small, but there are quite some recent reviews in different languages. The ratings are average (as of 2016)..

The smartphone comes in two color options: Metallic Black and Metallic Gold. It will be available for purchase exclusively on Flipkart starting from midnight today. As far as the specs are concerned, the Alcatel U5 HD comes with decent enough specs given the price range.

"With the new Alcatel U5 HD, first-time smartphone buyers can now enjoy a crisp and clear viewing experience on a 5-inch HD display and some really fun camera features.

Početna Testovi Testovi mobilnih uređaja Testovi mobilnih telefona Test: Alcatel U5 HD (video). Alcatel U5 HD poseduje jednu specijalno atraktivnu karakteristiku, a to je cena. U pitanju je veoma povoljna ulaznica u svet Androida 7.0 po ceni od oko 100 EUR-a. Veoma nas je zanimalo koliko telefona dobijate za ovu sumu, tako da smo par nedelja proveli sa ovim uređajem. Utisci su veoma pozitivni i iako postoje određene limitacije u skladu sa ulaznom cenovnom kategorijom, Alcatel U5 HD zapravo predstavlja veoma interesantan pametni telefon.. Alcatel U5 postoiji na tržištu još od februara ove godine, međutim Alcatel je želeo da ponudi pristupačan model sličnih karakteristika sa ipak nešto atraktivnijom prezentacijom. Zašto kažemo prezentacijom? Naime, Alcatel U5 je relativno sličan novom HD modelu, ali je manjkao na poljima koja se vide i kreiraju inicijalni utisak. Tu pre svega mislimo na ekran, a originalni U5 je sa svojim ekranom od 5 inča imao zaista prevaziđenu rezoluciju od 854x480 piksela.. Alcatel je ovaj, verovatno najveći aspekt, unapredio i sada je tu 1280x720 rezolucija koja odaje utisak uređaja sa aktuelnim karakteristikama. Kamere su druge na spisku, a tu je i nešto bolja izrada, tako da su unapređenja mahom ona koja se najlakše vide. U našem slučaju smo dobili uređaj namenjen testiranju od strane novinara, tako da nismo dobili puno "retail" pakovanje. Prema informacijama koje smo pronašli u paketu sa telefonom stiže samo osnovna oprema u vidu punjača, USB kabla, slušalica i dokumentacije, bez nekih specifičnih dodataka. Verujemo da postoji mogućnost i variranja u zavisnosti od tržišta, ali generalno je za očekivati da će se isporučivati samo osnovna oprema.. Imajući u vidu cenovnu kategoriju, Alcatel U5 HD izgleda prilično dobro i ne odaje kategoriju iz koje dolazi, već komotno možete pretpostaviti i da stiže iz nešto više (ne mnogo) klase. Bočni okviri nisu debeli, dok su gornji i donji možda nešto veći, ali je sve u granici prihvatljivog i ne bode oči što je pohvalno.. Leđa su plastična i skidaju se kako bi se dospelo do baterije i slotova za kartice. Dopada nam se činjenica da je plastični poklopac baterije zapravo opremljen teksturom koja čini da telefon ne kliza iz ruke. To znači da će i bez zaštitne maske U5 HD lepo ležati u ruci. Osim što lepo leži, telefon je izuzetno lagan, mada tačan podatak o tome nije iznesen od strane proizvođača. Što se izrade i spojeva tiče, sve je vrlo lepo uklopljeno, a tek pri namernom pritisku može da se javi krckanje plastike. U prevodu, ukoliko ga ne tražite, nećete ga ni naći.. Iznad ekrana na gornjem okviru pronalazimo LED blic, prednju kameru od solidnih 8 megapiksela, senzor blizine, osvetljenja i LED notifikaciju. Ovo je vrlo interesantno, jer na modelima ove kategorije često neka od ovih stavki nedostaje ili je u najboljem slučaju senzor prednje kamere daleko manje robustan po pitanju rezolucije.. Ispod ekrana se nalaze tri kapacitivna senzorska tastera koja nam se ne dopadaju. Jednostavno, to što su malo veći možemo da oprostimo iako čini da uređaj izgleda manje atraktivno. Ipak, razmak između njih je previše veliki tako da zahtevaju neprirodne pokrete da se aktiviraju. Posebno kada je potrebno aktivirati krajnji desni taster palcem dok uređaj držite jednom rukom. Što se njihove reakcije tiče ona je na zadovoljavajućem nivou i tek ponekad "omanu" u konstataciji aktivacije što je i za očekivati.. Kako uređaj ima poklopac ispod koga se kriju kartice, ivice kućišta su veoma čiste i uredne. Na desnom boku se kriju tasteri za pojačavanje i smanjivanje zvuka, kao i "power-on" dugme, dok na levom nema ni jednog detalja.. Konektor od 3.5mm se nalazi na vrhu, dok je microUSB konektor lociran na centralnom delu donje ivice, a tu je i mali otvor za mikrofon.. Uklonimo li plastični poklopac baterije, zatičemo ostatak interesantnih detalja. Pre svega, reč je o dual-SIM uređaju, sa dodatnim slotom za microSD memorijsku karticu. To znači da možete da imate sve tri kartice u telefonu što je pohvalno, jer neretko "high-end" modeli teraju korisnike na kompromis gde možete da birate između druge SIM ili memorijske kartice.. Dok je na nekim poljima zaista odlično realizovan, hardverski gledano Alcatel U5 HD je ipak tipičan predstavnik "entry-level" klase, a pritom nije unapređen u odnosu na standardni U5. Osnovu čini Mediatek MT6737 čipset koji je izrađen u 28nm proizvodnom procesu i sačinjen je od četiri Cortex A53 jezgra podešenih na frekvenciju od 1.1 GHz. On je uparen sa jednojezgarnim Mali-T720 grafičkim procesorom koji nudi bazične performanse. Sve u kompletu bi možda bilo mnogo bolje da Alcatel U5 HD raspolaže sa malo većom količinom RAM-a, a koje ima svega 1 GB što je zaista krajnja donja granica današnje tehnologije. Da je reč o 1.5 GB gde bi ostalo malo više raspoloživog operativnog prostora situacija bi bila znatno srećnija. Nažalost, od starta bez instaliranih aplikacija slobodnog RAM-a ima nešto manje od 200 MB, tako da je potrebno redovno pražnjenje RAM-a kroz ugrađenu prečicu. Dobra vest je da sam telefon raspolaže sa 8 GB interne memorije, tako da korisnik ne mora odmah da poseže za ubacivanjem memorijske kartice ukoliko nema neke specijalne potrebe za dodatnim prostorom.. 5.0 inča. Testovi govore za sebe i rezultat u Antutu od oko 28 hiljada bodova daje do znanja gde se nalazi ovaj model na polju performansi. Ruku na srce, opet treba imati u vidu koliko je zapravo pristupačan ovaj model i tako nešto je sasvim očekivano, jer su mogućnosti na nivou Snapdragon 410 čipseta, tako da u suštini dobijate solidan uređaj kada se sve sabere.. Sam interfejs je prilično standardan i u pitanju je Android 7.0 Nougat koji je veoma dobro optimizovan, mada bismo rado izbacili i to malo "bloatware-a" koji je Alcatel ubacio kako bismo rasteretili radnu memoriju. Vizuelno, radi se o neizmenjenom Andorid iskustvu koje naravno nešto malo sporije zbog slabijeg hardvera. Tu i tamo se pronalazi poneka dodatna aplikacija, ali Alcatel nije preterivao niti dodavao neke specifične softverske dodatke. Spomenuli bismo Phone Guard koji predstavlja korisnu aplikaciju za čišćenje i generalno održavanje softverske strane uređaja. Osim toga, korisnim smo pronašli i "Explorer" koji olakšava baratanje fajlovima.. Ekran je unapređen u velikoj meri u odnosu na Alcatel U5, pa tako U5 HD poseduje 5-inčni displej rezolucije 1280x720. Sam panel je IPS tipa, pa su uglovi gledanja veoma dobri, a oštrina prikaza znatno unapređena. Konkretno, sa vrlo niskih 196 ppi, gustina piksela je skočila na drastično atraktivnijih 294 ppi. Ekran pomalo vuče fabrički na plavkastu nijansu, ali je koloritet prilično dobar generalno gledano, a čak je i maksimalno osvetljenje prilično dobro, pa stoga osim pri najjačem suncu nećete imati problem da vidite šta se dešava na ekranu kada ste napolju.. Baterija koja je ugrađena u telefon ima kapacitet od 2200 mAh, što je sasvim korektno. U pogledu autonomije, možemo reći da će pregurati oko dan i po nekog aktivnijeg korišćenja, ali i više u trenucima kada ga ne budete preterano koristili. Ipak, ono što je sigurno da će 24 časa prebaciti "bez greške", što i ne čudi s obzirom na to da se radi o relativno nezahtenom hardveru, a tu posebno mislimo na čipset koji radi na relativno niskoj frekvenciji.. Alcatel U5 HD raspolaže sa mono zvučnikom ima solidnu snagu, mada se ne izdvaja u bilo kom smislu. Eventualno možemo da primetimo blago izobličenje zvuka kada je pojačan do maksimuma. Ipak, za konzumiranje multimedije je više nego dobar, posebno je ima kvalitetan audio izlaz na slušalicama.. Kamere kod ovog modela su pretrpele promene u odnosu na standardni U5 model, pa tako Alcatel U5 HD poseduje daleko bolju kombinaciju u vidu zadnjeg senzora sa 13 MP i prednjeg sa čak 8 MP. Glavna kamera (zadnja) pored fotografija u rezoluciji od 3264x2488 piksela ima mogućnost snimanja u 720p rezoluciji. Verujemo da 1080p nije bio moguć zbog ograničene snage ugrađenog čipseta.. Kvalitet fotografija u oba slučaja zaista nije preterano veliki i tu nema zbora. Obe kamere "pate" od velike količine šuma i kompresije, tako da slike mogu biti atraktivne uz malo više truda, ali će i tu njihova upotrebna vrednost biti najviše prilagođena za društvene mreže, pre nego za bilo kakvu ozbiljiju upotrebu. Dinamički raspon je ograničen, pa tako savetujemo korišćenje dodatnih aplikacija za naknadnu obradu kako biste dobili malo atraktivnije kadrove. Ovde se ponovo vraćamo na više puta korišćenu kvalifikaciju, ali definitivno je reč o odličnim rezultatima za cenovnu klasu. Posebno kada uzmete u obzir da su tu i blicevi za obe kamere koji sami po sebi dodatno olakšavaju fotografisanje u loše osvetljenim uslovima.. Sam interfejs aplikacije za kameru je ekstremno jednostavan i prilagođen novim korisnicima. Broj opcija je redukovan kako bi se korisnik što lakše snašao, a tu su i neke dodatne opcije kao što je HDR režim, "time-lapse", režim za pravljenje kolaža sa fotografijama, kao i panorama.. Alcatel U5 HD je solidan budžetski model koji zaista ima nekoliko jakih strana, kao što su ekran, kamere (za svoju klasu), opremljenost radiom, slotovima za dve sim i jednom memorijskom karticom, ugrađenih 8 GB memorije i nekoliko simpatičnih softverskih rešenja. U radu se primećuje da se hardver pomalo bori sa Androidom 7.0 ponajviše zbog skromnog RAM-a koji je možda mogao biti 500 MB veći što bi verovatno donelo malo fluidniji rad, posebno kada se malo razmašete sa brojem pokrenutih aplikacija.. Osim toga, reč je o kvalitetno izrađenom uređaju koji će steći sasvim sigurno veliki broj poklonika, jer predstavlja daleko bolji izbor od standardnog U5 modela, a biće dostupan u ponudi operatera i to verovatno po ekstremno povoljnim uslovima.. Prednosti: - Cena - 720p ekran - Prednji i zadnji blic. Nedostaci: - Fokus kamere ume da se zbuni - 1 GB RAM-a - Malo fluidniji rad interfejsa bi bio dobrodošao. Moj Alcatel U5 HD je iz Telenora. U startu je iskrsao problem sa baterijom koja sa 90% uvece, ujutro bude na nuli odnosno telefon se iskljuci. Nakon reklamacije vratili su mi telefon sa porukom da je sve u redu nakon njihovog testiranja. Da li gresim u rukovanju ili... Drugo ovaj telefon sa oznakom 5047Y nije sa dve kartice i ne mogu da ga pronadjem nigde na internetu. Od kada je 720p ekran na 5" prednost?. Test: Motorola Moto G5S Plus (Video).

The best price does not always mean you get the best deal. Take into consideration the warehouse, from which the device will be shipped and consult your local customs regulations, so you will be prepared to pay any customs fees and taxes, if necessary. For example, if you're based in Europe and you order a device from a warehouse in China, it is very likely that the device will be held by the customs in your country and will be cleared once you pay the due taxes. Hence, it might turn out that ordering a device from an EU warehouse might be cheaper. Don't forget to check the delivery and warranty conditions of the online store you want to buy from. Before ordering, check whether the device is in stock and its final price in your local currency.
