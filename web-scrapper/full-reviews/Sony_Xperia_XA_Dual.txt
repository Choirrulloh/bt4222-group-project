Sony Xperia XA Dual - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 … 25 26 ». Hallo friends im using sony xa dual. Im facing when I use headset with my xa pain comes from ears any body has this problem. Hello peeps, I have been using this phone for at least 9 months i guess. First of all, I definitely wouldn't recommend you this phone but wait let me explain. (Please read all of them, thx!) There's a whole range of smartphones with great specs and even greater value than the xperia xa dual. Besides, the most concerning issue of this phone is the overheating. It heats up very easily especially when you are playing games with high fps. The phone also heats up when you take some shots with the phone's camera. When the phone heats up, it doesn't just heat up the phone but drain the battery as well. If you have seen the complains, its all about the battery drain so i think you get the idea of that part. Its just not the average battery drain you would expect from a mid range phone. Okay what about the performance? Well, its not that great either but what can you expect from a mid range phone.. Am i right? Last of all : the camera. The image produced are a bit softer and the front facing camera just won't meet my expectations. Honestly though, its still a usable phone with edge to edge body ratio. The body is sleek and the modern design wont dissapoint you. Overall its an OK phone with a slightly higher price. Thanks for reading all of them.. usat., 14 Dec 2017 I had using this Xperia xa mobile atlest one year. When we using camera that time the phone is... im okay with my xperia dual. only one problem, why the music is not loud. even my old nokia polyphonic ringtone is louder than my xperia. Sony xa plus is the worst phone I have ever used works slowly when data is switched on ,it can't perform multitasking what should I do. I had using this Xperia xa mobile atlest one year. When we using camera that time the phone is very hitting. And a others problem That is the very poor battery life. I thought This problems are the facing all Xperia xa user.. So i recommend my all frnd they were didn't buy this mobile phone. I am using this phone since one year, its performance is good but it gets heated up very fast particularly while we use camera for long time. i want to share some serious problems with this phone regarding its built quality, first of all at this price range its body plastic is very poor as my phone back side got minor scratches when already its back cover was on due to fine dust particles(not an issue with my Samsung at all), well which is not a major problem.. but now after 11 months my glass for back camera(13Mp) got blur(damaged glass surface) on its own with in genuine use, i visited Sony service center, as my phone was under warranty they charged me rupees 300\- as service charge and without warranty they charge 800-1000 rupees for the same problem & with waiting period if minimum one week so this is very costly brand after you purchase it.At this price range the quality is not up to match,,. but what st the heck i can do from 2300mah battery. it drains very fast and heats up when using camera and downloading files from wifi(eg:torrents) i like the brand but why they add a small batteries to their products and this is a waste of money. the main things that I want from a mobile are performance, storage and battery &#128542;. raza, 19 Aug 2017 Now my xperia xa is making me crazzy.. now its too slow day by day after updation of nougot an... After nauget upgrade the camera became slow .When i want to restart it then it frize sometime. I had using this xperia xa dual for almost 1 years and 3 month, all i got to say is there is pro and con,the con is heating ,its no so serious,but it will heat if using a camera for a long time or heavy usage like gaming,other is battery life,under heavy use it only get half a day,average usage will get barely 1 day. but on other side ,the pro,after more than 1 years usage i got to say ,this phone is still smooth and snappy,performance still good,only need to take care not to cramp internel storage,camera front and back good enough for me and its charging quite fast even with normal charger. overall,this phone is good because its still maintain a stable and smooth performance after more than a year because some of my friend bought xiaomi but after 6 month it get slow and laggy.the only thing that need to live with it is heating under heavy usage and battery thats all,i recommend this phone to someone that doing light usage and snap a photo sometimes ,cheers... I got this phone for a discount and all i can it one hell of a phone for the price of RM 799.The performance is top notch and the screen is beautiful given for the price range.The battery kinda suck as i manage to to only keep it charge for 1 day but other that it performs well for my daily needs. Dont buy unable to upgrade the OS. Vick, 03 Nov 2017 Is there any heating issue in the device or what about battery ? Please help i want to buy Extreme heating issue & battery life is not good. Is there any heating issue in the device or what about battery ? Please help i want to buy. I would like to buy a new xa dual. Pls feedback give me, how is battery life. Bunny, 21 Aug 2017 Heating machine. Getting with simple use and after update battery drains too fast gives 4 5 ho... more Battery backup bad.ear sound very bad. What are you thinking about this phone?. You, can move most of apps to SD card. Go to settings >apps>select particular app>inside it select storage >memory shared>storage used>change it to SD card. Most of apps can be moved to SD card except Google apps & whatsapp. Please Tyr it I have tried it, works.. Has 16gig memory but you can't move apps to the the memory card so it quickly fills up. For a phone built in 2016 to lack 4g is absurd. Battery life is the worst I have ever seen in a mobile phone. Only preserves battery when the saving mode is activated but you lose functionality. Only nice thing about this device is the camera. If I had an option to return the phone would gladly do that. Sathiyen, 26 Aug 2017 How to enable Jio 4G volte in Xperiaxa Keep the mobile data on.

So you’ll never be left fumbling while the moment passes.. A super-fast autofocus to capture the instant. Xperia XA features Hybrid Autofocus to freeze the action in a bright, sharp picture in less than a second. And thanks to wide focal coverage, you can touch anywhere on the screen, even the corners, and fast focus on a subject.. Make your nights shine Stunning low-light shots now with both cameras. Want to capture a selfie at a party, or maybe photograph the details of a beautiful cityscape at night? With Xperia XA’s highly responsive sensors you get clear, sharp shots even in low light, with both the front and back cameras.. Need a quick battery top-up?

Sony Xperia XA Dual Best Price in Sri Lanka 2017 : Shop online for Sony Xperia XA Dual only on Dialcom.lk at Rs.22,900. The Sony Xperia XA retail box is deceptively simple, plain white on the outside with just Xperia's new X logo to catch the eye. When you open it, the sides provide a burst of color, well played, Sony.. The box we got with our review unit held only a microUSB port and a charger (1.5A). Note that Sony packages phones differently based on region (there may even be differences between carriers in the same country). Double-check what's in the box before you buy, if you were hoping for a fast charger or a headset.. The Sony Xperia XA measures 143.6 x 66.8 x 7.9 mm. As we already mentioned, this makes it the narrowest 5" phone in our database. It's light (137.4g) and thin too. The rounded front glass and metal sides flow smoothly and make it feel even thinner. It's a bit tall for a 5" phone (especially for no hardware keys or stereo speakers), however, that's the dimension that has the least impact on usability. The weight is evenly distributed, so you don't feel like the phone wants to tip over.. Sony has always taken pride in the craftsmanship of its products and the Xperia XA is a strong effort. Yes, it follows the base Xperia design, but its the small tweaks that make it great.. The 2.5D shaped glass, the narrow bezels, the metal frame, the proportions of the thickness and weight come together just right. It's not often that a mid-ranger can make you wish its flagship brother was more like it, but the XA pulls that off on the Xperia X and X performance.. The Xperia XA is one of the best-designed Sonys in recent years. Note that those two have a metal back and polycarbonate sides, while the Xperia XA flips that - metal sides, polycarbonate back.. It's a good quality material, soft and smooth to the touch, a bit prone to fingerprints, but flows into the sides just as smoothly as the front glass. And polycarbonate is more durable than glass, so the clumsier among you might actually be better off this way.. The old-school OmniBalance power key on the right is easy to reach with your index finger or thumb depending on which hand you use to hold the phone.. The volume rocker is poorly positioned • No fingerprint reader on this Power key. The volume rocker is cramped between the power key and the shutter key. It's reasonably easy to press with the left hand, but reaching it with the thumb of your right hand is a challenge.. Again, there's no fingerprint reader on the power key or anywhere else on the device. If it makes you feel better, US buyers of the Xperia X and X Performance aren't getting a fingerprint reader either. And given that it's a mid-range device we are talking about here we won't be taking away many points for that.. The other side of the Xperia XA is for the card slots, which are hidden under a flap. We have the single-SIM model, which offers spearate slots for a nanoSIM and a microSD card. There's a dual-SIM model too, there the microSD card remains separate.. The card slots on the Xperia XA are hidden behind a flap. Both sides have noticeable cuts near the top and the bottom corner. It's not the cuts that bug us, it's that the material clearly changes - the left and right sides are different from the top and bottom sides.. The front has fairly roomy bezels above and below the screen. The top one houses the earpiece, 8MP selfie camera, sensors (proximity, ambient light) and the notification light (small, invisible when off, positioned in the top left corner).. The bottom bezel is barren, though, Sony has reserved stereo speakers for the higher-end X phones.. An 8MP selfie camera, earpiece and sensors above the screen. The loudspeaker on the Xperia XA is actually on the bottom, a grill nestled in the corner next to the mouthpiece and microUSB 2.0 port. The secondary mic for stereo audio and noise cancellation is on top. There you'll also find the 3.5mm audio jack.. Loudspeaker on the bottom • microUSB 2.0 and mic too • 3.5mm audio jack on top. The 13MP camera on the back is put in the upper left corner with a single-LED flash below it. The camera is flush with the back, better still because of the back's curved shape it doesn't quite touch the surface when you leave it on a table.. The polycarbonate back is glued on tight. Don't even try to open it, we'll tell you what's inside - a 2,300mAh battery.. The polycarbonate back is home to a 13MP camera and its LED flash friend. There are four color options available and the hue covers the whole phone - front, sides and back. You can pick from Graphite Black (the one we have), White, Lime Gold and Rose Gold. You will find Sony Xperia XA Dual Sim phone at the cheapest price only at Dialcom.lk for Rs.22,900 as at 11/12/2017 16:02:25.. Dialcom © 1999 - All rights Reserved.
