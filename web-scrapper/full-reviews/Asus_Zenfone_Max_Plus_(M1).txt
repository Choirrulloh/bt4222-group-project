more ... more .... more ... more .... Asus ZenFone Max Plus (M1) hands-on. Asus ZenFone Max Plus (M1) hands-on. by John Velasco. Tags :. Hands-on - Hands-on + Android - Android + Asus - Asus + CES2018 - CES2018 +. It took quite some time, but it looks that Asus is finally giving into the trends. You know, the kinds that we saw happen in the smartphone market throughout 2017. The Asus ZenFone Max Plus (M1) is the device that finally brings dual-cameras, a large screen with an aspect ratio of 18:9, and a premium design fused into one smartphone. Sure, you can say that they're rather late to the game, but don't be too quick now to dismiss it – just because it has some intriguing things under its sleeve.. Checking out the Asus ZenFone Max Plus (M1) for the very first time, we can't help but to notice its premium design. It's clearly going for a far more uniform look with its all-metal chassis, providing it with that comforting feeling that it's not cheap. Best of all, too, the phone seems to be hand-friendly thanks to its compact size. However, it's worth pointing out that even with its svelte chassis, the Asus ZenFone Max Plus (M1) is packing a pretty substantial 4130 mAh battery, which is rated to deliver up to 26 hours of talk time. That makes perfect sense, given that it's called the Max Plus.. In going with the trends, the Asus ZenFone Max Plus (M1) features a 5.7-inch 1080 x 2160 display with that oh-so typical 18:9 aspect ratio. While this move is appreciated, the bezels surrounding the screen appear to be somewhat thicker than others we've been seeing. Then again, this is the first foray for Asus into this new screen aspect ratio. Another trend that it has adopted is featuring a dual-camera system, broken down to a 16MP main camera and a 12MP wide angle one – while the front is blessed with a generous 16MP snapper.. Rounding out the package, it's powered by a MediaTek MT6750T processor, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone, and also a face unlock feature. All of this makes for a convincing package, especially when it's anticipated to launch stateside in the US and Canada starting in February for $229. We weren't necessarily astounded by the phone when we first checked it out, but that price point is really tough to overlook – so that's an advantage that should help the phone out when it launches as an unlocked smartphone!.

Asus Zenfone Max Plus (M1) - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 4 5 ». ASUS you need to take an action on this! as no good feedback comes from users using this model.. Dissapointed on the battery life, and overheating issues. Chichiri, 14 Feb 2018 My zenfone max plus m1 is 5 days old anditcan only last 4 hours or less. more don't check the 2x lifespan so it won't drain fast. Originally i wanted the normal zenfone max; no finger print & dual camera based on my budget. I have 2 choice; zenfone max or samsung j7 pro. Yet, i chose max since j7 pro's android only 6.0 which is older. But the seller suggest i take max plus since if differs myr100 only so i take it. I used asus zenfone go zc500tg previously, but it's so laggy and always stopped app for like everytime. Which disturb my work if i use it urgently. Camera - 8.5/10 (wide angle is nice for group photo, but only up to 8mp, kinda downline for me. They have selfie master which similar with other beauty app). screen - 8/10 (they have this one hand operation view, which quite handy for a multitasking person like me. plus glove mode, i havent test yet but will do in the future. Im not sure whether it is Youtube new feature or this phone, u can watch it in 2 types of full screen, 1 which utilized the whole screen, 1 is normal view full screen. No corning gorilla like max pro, from what i know it protect your screen from minor scratch & crack. Thats make me to handle it with extra super duper care & alert. I drop my zenfone go hundred times, no injury until the ultimate fall from motorbike. Yeah, one big scar across the screen). battery - 7/10 (so far, as a new phone no problem. Full charged on 6am, use it the whole day without having a panic attack in finding my powerbank which is my everyday routine. Depends on what i do on that day, if i watch video it'll drain faster yet not so fast like my zenfone go. Bare in mind i use it with 4g internet 24hours & active streaming-fb, youtube, google, whatsapp, wechat, some on9 game, joox & instagram. Charging it to full took time & somehow annoyed me without a reason. Asus are well known for their hot battery, my zenfone go even have personal fan to cool it down when it is too hot. So far max plus never get that hot level that i got, only warm when i use youtube continuosly ). unlock - 9.5/10 (finger print is like a must in 2018. I havent tried face recognition yet thus 9.5 score). mobile manager - 10/10 (i thought it was file manager but im wrong. Similar to clean master, u dont need to install clean app. I love it because no ads for sure. zen.ui 4.0 interface - 10/10 (prrobably what makes me like asus is i dont need to install lock app theme & phone theme. Plus asus keyboard can customize theme & can put picture in it! Again i dont need to install unless u want more updated emoji). android 7.0 nougat - 8/10 (u cant complain if u have 7.0 in 2018 unless u got 5.1 lolipop. Probably because that im aware that 8.0 version is already available on certain phone since it is the latest one. But 7.0 quite ok, u cant complain yet). reverse charge - 4/10 (the lowest one, why? It is not fuctional. I test it with my zenfone go for this feature, but unfortunately nothing happen. I dont know whether i need to set up first or what, thus 4 since it is bad number in chinese. overall - 7.5/10 (because google apps took my storage the most out of all the apps, & u cant uninstall it. I mean i dont use google play music & tv and google photo app. I hate it cuz its sit there like parasite. The one that makes me mad as hell is that i have to use google music or joox to listen my music. The box comes with usual usb charger, pin to access the simcard & sd card, earphone with extra sets of buds, usb for reverse charging, & silicone case. No screen protecter, depends on the shop whether foc or upgrade to tempered glass-a must. Affordable price, the only differs max plus & max pro is dual camera, finger print & ram. If u have more budget, go for max pro or nova 2i. But if lesser budget yet wanted hi-tech feature, this one is ok since it is one of the latest.). My review based on my own experience. So, it might differs with others experience with max plus. My suggestion, go for lots of survey and asked the expert. I took half an hour just for arguing & discussing the specs with my tech geek friend on the phone b4 finally bought it. Dont ask girls, they just bought phone bcuz it is trendy & celebrity endorsement. Differs from me altho im a girl, i go for specs first b4 else. I dont bought asus because of gong yoo, thats for sure.. My zenfone max plus m1 is 5 days old anditcan only last 4 hours or less. When i checked the Battery usage the '' standby'' mode is consuming most of the power. I already customized the settings, brightness, kill apps, blah blah but no change. I have 7 day replacement period i just hope the store replace it fast.. Soooo Disappointed !! BATTERY drains so fast !. Too many complain regarding this device..

PCMag reviews products independently , but we may earn affiliate commissions from buying links on this page. LAS VEGAS—The new Asus Zenfone Max Plus M1 is built in the newly mainstream 18:9 form factor, and its dual cameras are something you don't generally see on a phone under $250, making it one of the most compelling phones we've seen here at CES so far.. The Zenfone Max M1's metal chassis is part of what makes it look so good for a $229 device. It sports a 2,160-by-1,080, tall-and-narrow 5.7-inch display, and feels cool and metallic in the hand. Eyeing it, I thought it looked a little grainy, but that could just be the wallpaper selections.. At this price point, you're not going to get a flagship processor; the Max M1 runs a Mediatek chip with LTE Cat 6 and Android 7.0. But it's surprisingly full featured; it has 3GB RAM, a huge 4150mAh battery, a fingerprint scanner on the back, and face unlock technology. The unit we checked out had 4GB of RAM, but that's not the first time we've seen an Asus phone on a show floor that wasn't quite the retail model.. Also, I love the dual rear cameras. The front camera is 16 megapixels, and on the back, there's a 16-megapixel main camera and an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera. You'd typically have to pay $100 more to get this particular kind of dual-camera setup.. I don't have all that much to say about the hands-on experience with this phone, except that it felt more premium than it is thanks to the metal body, the dual cameras, and the form factor. We'll see when we get it into our labs whether the CPU drags things down, although I suspect it won't as long as you're not running heavy games.. The phone will be available next month, and it will be compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile.. Check Out the Best Photos From CES 2018. Ohio Man Charged With Creating 'Fruitfly' Mac Malware.

A good first attempt but specs are just too low to attract any real interest from majority of potential buyers.. Unfortunately, Asus has a history of not updating older phone software. I know of this first hand unfortunately. At least better than Oppo, Vivo & Xiaomi. If you really like the latest android rom go and buy project treble phone.. RM899 for this kind of specs for the late 2017? I think Asus mobile division and marketing division are going for cold war and didn’t talking to each other.. If batteri tahan and camera not bad then can go a head liao rm 899, peduli apa proceesor lah, exoensive processor can scroll faster kah??, not playing heavy games no difference 1 whatever. Kecuali wan showoff then tambah 4ribu beli iphoneX.. Guys it is not 720p from what i read , it is actually 2160×1080 ! pretty decent for a price only rm899 don't you think ?. Based on the spec sheet provided by ASUS Malaysia which is also published on their website, the ASUS ZenFone Max Plus uses a 5.7-inch HD (1440 by 720) display. You can click on the spec sheet link in the post for more info.. Hmmm , its kinda confusing … maybe you should check this , it saids 5.7-inch Full HD (2160 x 1080) resolution https://www.asus.com/my/Phone/ZenFone-Max-Plus-M1…. Another ASUS site stated fullHD screen. No details on the trade in rm200. Is it up to rm200 or rm200 for any working phone trade in. My ZenFone 2 has been good so I am getting this new one. Still don’t trust chinese phones lol.. Don't buy this phone…unless you don't mind with only 2.4Ghz WiFi support.. 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. 11 12 13 14 15 16 17. 18 19 20 21 22 23 24. 25 26 27 28 29 30 31.

Home » Editorials » ASUS ZenFone Max Plus M1 Review: Is ASUS’ First 18:9 Phone Worth It?. ASUS ZenFone Max Plus M1 Review: Is ASUS’ First 18:9 Phone Worth It?. We review the ZenFone Max Plus M1!. 5.7-inch 18:9 full HD+ IPS Display. 16-megapixel f/2.0 primary camera and 8-megapixel wide angle rear camera with PDAF. Design: The ZF4 Max’s fraternal twin. Display: Good enough for the price. Performance: Older MT6750T really hurt performance. Software: Face Unlock is a cool feature, but we still recommend using fingerprints. Cameras: Dual cameras are an improvement over previous model. Battery: This is the Zenfone Max we know. Verdict: Lives up to its pedigree but in for a tough fight!. The 18:9 aspect ratio is becoming the defacto required feature for mid-range phones to even stand a chance in an extremely competitive market. Taiwanese manufacturer ASUS is well aware of this, and has released an updated version of their battery-focused ZenFone Max to take advantage of the new design trend. The ZenFone Max Plus M1 trades a few hundred mAh in favor of a full HD, 18:9 display and better cameras which would have been fine trade-off. if it wasn’t for a puzzling processor choice that gums up the works.. Is the ZenFone Max Plus M1 truly a battery king? We’ll find out. With development times being what they are, it made sense for ASUS to simply adapt an already existing design to use for their first 18:9 phone. Specifically, we’re talking about the ZenFone 4 Max. ASUS took many of the same design cues from that particular phone and applied it to the ZF Max Plus M1 with a few tweaks.. Related Posts: Watch: Asus Zenfone Max Plus M1 Video Review ASUS ZenFone Max Plus M1 Unboxing, Initial Review:… Asus Zenfone 4 Max vs Asus Zenfone 4 Max Lite:…. The curved sides, camera placement as well as the coloration of the new phone looks pretty close to the ZF4 Max, though obviously ASUS had to make a few changes to accommodate some of the new features on the old chassis.. Specifically, they moved the front-mounted fingerprint scanner to the rear. We don’t really mind this change – we prefer rear-mounted fingerprint scanners to front-mounted ones anyway , since your finger naturally falls to that particular area when you’re holding the phone with your hand.. The volume and power buttons are still located on the right side of the phone, and the 3.5mm jack, USB port and speaker grille are still at their old haunts, namely on the top and bottom respectively. The dual-camera module is still located on the upper left side of the phone, flanked on the right by an LED flash.. One nice thing about the ZF Max Plus M1 is that it can accommodate two SIM cards and a microSD slot – no need to choose between extra storage or an extra SIM.. Because of the display, the chunky chin and top portion of the previous battery-centric model has been largely reduced. The front facing camera is located on the top, along with the other sensors and earpiece.. Since the phone uses an 18:9 aspect ratio, the ZF Max Plus M1 has reduced bezels on the side, giving the display an overall size of 5.7-inches. The side bezels aren’t as thin as we’d like, but they’re thin enough that they’re not going to be much on an eyesore as you use the phone.. As for actual display quality, the one on the ZF Max Plus M1 isn’t too bad. There’s good viewing angles all around, and colors are pretty accurate. The extra pixels on the top and bottom of the phone mean you get more screen real-estate when you’re using Facebook, Instagram, Chrome and other apps that support it.. Powering the ZF Max Plus M1 is MediaTek’s MT6750T octa-core processor running at 1.5GHz, paired with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable storage.. ASUS’ choice of processor is a little puzzling for the phone. While we’ve seen other budget devices bear the MT6750T processor before , the decision to put what is essentially a budget chipset on a mid-range device is a little disappointing. While navigation and app use was largely unaffected by the chipset’s age (it was announced back in 2016) people looking to play Android games with the new phone will have to tone down graphical settings if they want smooth, consistent frames.. The lithography (manufacturing process) used with the MT6750T is also a little problematic, considering it’s built on 28nm process. The smaller the die, the more power-efficient the processor is, and many phones that it’s going up against have processors that are using the more power-efficient 14nm or 22nm manufacturing process.. The phone’s lithography and processor age has a big impact on battery life, as you’ll see later.. Just like most phones that ASUS releases, the ZF Max Plus M1 comes with their ZenUI 4.0 overlay on top of Android Nougat.. While we still yearn for a more stock Android experience, ASUS has taken positive steps to reduce the bloatware included in their phones, which has helped substantially in the overall user experience.. New with the ZF Max Plus M1 is the face unlock capability. The feature worked reasonably well, though it relies too much on the available light level to work accurately. We’ve found it to flounder a bit in places with dim lighting, though you can bypass it with your fingerprint if it’s not registering in low light.. The ZF Max Plus M1 has better cameras than the ZF4 Max. The main shooter is a 16-megapixel deal with PDAF an f/2.0 aperture lens, paired with an 8-megapixel panoramic wide camera.. Overall image quality has improved thanks to that wider lens and higher resolution sensor, though images will still suffer a little bit if there’s not enough light around you when you’re shooting. Color reproduction is good and overall picture quality is what you’d expect from a phone at its price range. The 8-megapixel wide camera is still a little underwhelming, fit to be used only in places where there’s plenty of light. Don’t even try to use it in low light.. The whole point of the ZenFone Max series of phones is providing longer run times thanks to bigger than average batteries in their bodies. With the ZF Max Plus M1 taking a hit in the battery department in favor of a better display, many have been curious to see how long the phone lasts on a single charge.. Initial results on our synthetic benchmarks were very disappointing given the Max series has been known for but after an update to help optimize battery life, we’re happy to say that the M1 lives up to its “Battery King” moniker. The new results on PC Mark’s battery benchmark. has the device clock in at 11 hours and 28 minutes. In real-world use, that amounts to about a day and a half of juice though mileage will vary depending on usage habits.. One of the main complaints of past iterations of the Max series was the fact that it didn’t support fast charging and we’re glad that Asus has listened to the people. Topping up the Max Plus M1 will take about 2 hours, which isn’t bad considering its capacity.. On paper, the Asus Zenfone Max Plus M1 checks most boxes that make it a pretty good option for those looking for less than Php 12,000. You’ve got an 18:9 display with great pixel density, an improvement on its dual cameras, premium build quality, and great battery life that makes it live up to its given name as the Taiwanese company’s Battery King. The chink in its armor is the MediaTek processor that may leave heavier users wanting a bit more power under the hood, so keep your usage habits in mind if you are looking to pick up the M1.. While the phone certainly lives up to its pedigree, the extremely crowded and competitive marketplace for the mid ange market means that ASUS has its work cut out for it with the ZenFone Max Plus M1.. The phone retails for Php 11,995 and will go on sale on January 14. First 200 customers will receive exclusive freebies that amounts up to Php 7,595..

Adrian Diaconescu January 11, 2018 12:01 pm. Let’s not beat around the bush. The 2018 Consumer Electronics Show, which is technically still ongoing but in all honesty finished as far as product announcements are concerned, has been a bitter pill to swallow for mobile enthusiasts.. With companies like Samsung , LG , HTC and even Sony looking to unveil the next generation of flagship Android phones between February and March, mobile underdog Asus was left grabbing unusual attention in Las Vegas this week.. We were so desperate to spend some one-on-one time with a decent smartphone at CES 2018 that we (largely) chose to ignore both the convoluted name of the ZenFone Max Plus (M1) and its prior appearances in Russia and other European markets .. Priced at a very reasonable $229 for a February US unlocked launch, the Asus ZenFone Max Plus M1 delivers an impressive amount of battery juice while following 2:1 “full-view” display trends.. There are other premium and trendy features offered at that irresistible price point too, including dual rear cameras and facial recognition. Also, the ZenFone Max Plus doesn’t look half bad on the outside, thanks to a respectably ergonomic and stylish metal build.. Android 7.0 Nougat software and middling MediaTek processing power are probably the handset’s most glaring flaws, but we’re still curious to see how everything performs over a more extended period of time..
