Quick look: Android Go on the Alcatel 1X (Updated). by Bogdan Petrovan 2 days ago. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Alcatel informed us that some of the Alcatel 1X units that we were shown during the pre-briefing were reference devices running non-approved and incomplete software. We will revisit the Alcatel 1X tomorrow and hopefully we can bring you some good news about its performance. Original post, February 24: One of Googleâs big initiatives for 2018 is Android Go , a lite version of Android 8 Oreo that is optimized for phones with 1 GB of RAM or less. Android head Hiroshi Lockheimer teased several Android Go devices coming at MWC 2018 and today Alcatel introduced the first one.. Read: Alcatel’s 2018 phone lineup unveiled at MWC. The Alcatel 1X looks and feels as âbudgetâ as youâd expect from a phone that retails for 100 euros, but its saving grace might be the fact that it actually runs Oreo. Thatâs not something that can be said about most phones out there, including some that cost seven times more than the 1X.. How good is Oreo Go edition on the Alcatel 1X? If you were hoping for the answer to be âsmooth as butter,â youâre in for a disappointment. Despite the optimizations and down-sizing, thereâs a jankiness to the Alcatel 1X you just canât get around. Loading the recent apps takes a noticeable moment and there are frequent instances of lag when scrolling through the app drawer or through a webpage.. But! This is a phone that costs less than some people spend on a case! Besides the 1 GB of RAM, the phone features a quad-core MT6739 processor clocked at 1.28 GHz, 16 GB of onboard storage and a 5.3-inch 18:9 âVGA+â display. Considering these specs, itâs actually impressive to see Android 8.1 Oreo in the About section of the settings, and itâs even more impressive that Oreo Go edition is fully serviceable. One other thing to keep in mind is that the phones we tested at the Alcatel pre-briefing were pre-production units, meaning thereâs still time for the company to stamp out performance issues before the public release.. The operating system is just a part of the Android Go platform â the other main component is a set of slimmed-down Go apps, including Assistant Go, YouTube Go, and Files Go. We werenât able to test these apps extensively, but in our short time with them, they did the job just fine. You wonât get the full experience you get with the regular versions, but thatâs not really the point of the Go platform.. Android Oreo Go edition addresses one of the biggest problems that plague the low-end of the Android smartphone market, which is the fact that customers rarely get the latest version of Android out of the box. The other big issues are the lack of security patches and the lack of OS updates. The 1X is a mixed bag in this regard: Alcatel says it will receive âregular Android security updates, on a minimum quarterly basis.â Thatâs not as good as the monthly cadence that high-end phones offer, but itâs a step above what cheap Android phones have offered so far in terms of updates, which is to say, nothing. Unfortunately, Alcatel had nothing to share when it comes to OS updates.. Leaving Android Go edition aside, the Alcatel 1X comes in multiple variants, depending on the market: 1 GB or 2 GB of RAM, single-SIM or dual-SIM, fingerprint sensor or no fingerprint sensor, 8 MP camera or 13 MP camera, and even Google Assistant and no Google Assistant.. The model with 2 GB of RAM features Face Key, a camera-based facial recognition feature. While itâs not as secure as PINs, patterns, or fingerprints, Face Key worked pretty fast and reliably in our time with the phone.. Available in multiple colors starting in April, the Alcatel 1X will start from 99 euros for the single-SIM version and 109 euros for the dual-SIM model.. Read: General Mobile’s Android Go edition phone leaked. At the end of the day, Alcatel and Google managed to put 2018 software on 2013 hardware and made them work together harmoniously, more or less. We look forward to seeing what other manufacturers were able to achieve with Android Go. Stay tuned for more coverage from MWC 2018 in the coming days.. Alcatel MWC 2018 Android Go Alcatel 1X.

While most of us are looking forward to new and powerful flagships in Mobile World Congress, Alcatel has launched its first Android Go phone and is simply called the 1X.. But the Alcatel 3V is the largest and sharpest member of the 2:1 family, with a 6-inch FHD+ panel in tow, while the 5.7-inch HD+ Alcatel 5 has a completely bezel-less chin and dual front-facing camera going for it. We also get a fingerprint scanner on the back and Alcatel's Face Key facial unlocking feature. Every device in the 3 series clocks in under €200 euro. There's a dual front camera setup on here that includes a 13MP sensor with f/2 aperture and 5MP wide angle camera, as well as a 12MP reader camera with an f/2.2 aperture. The one caveat: Alcatel hasn't discussed plans to release any of these devices in the United States, so domestic phone fans on a budget will have to look elsewhere for now. This is in addition to Social Mode, a suite of editing tools created to " to take photos in a fun and more efficient way ". "The 10" variant has a 1280 x 800 resolution, also 1GB of RAM but storage has been doubled to 16GB.. Coming to the Alcatel 3 line, the company states this one is created to offer a relatively similar experience to the Alcatel 5, but at a cheaper price point.. The next phone to be announced is the Alcatel 3, which comes with a few beefed-up specs when compared to the 1X. Although at present only the Alcatel 3V is available with the standard model and the X variants are due to become available " in select markets " next month.. Say hello to the Alcatel 1X, Alcatel 3, Alcatel 3V, Alcatel 3X, and Alcatel 5. The camera system is smart enough to tell when you should switch from a Portrait Mode selfie to a wide-angle shot with friends when there are more than two faces in frame. The phone's storage is also expandable up to 32GB. There's a 3,000mAh battery, fingerprint sensor, and Android Oreo included, too. Such kind of devices are usually favored in countries such as India and certain European countries, therefore the Alcatel 1X will be available in both single and dual SIM variants, which will carry a price tag of €100 (RM482) and €110 (RM530) respectively. It's running Android Oreo and has a 3,000 mAh battery that Alcatel claims will provide a solid 17 hours of talk time.. Samsung Galaxy S9 Starts At $960 CAD Unlocked In Canada.

Cellular: Mobile Phones, Call Contracts, Content, MMS and SMS. It is free, and it takes less than 1 minute to register.. It is free, and it comes with many benefits.. Results 1 to 2 of 2. Join Date Mar 2016. The alcatel 1X has a modest starting price of €100, but it runs the latest Android 8.1 Oreo. It should be noted that this is Android Go Edition, due to the low-ish hardware specs. The phone has an 18:9 screen, 5.3" in diagonal, and a fingerprint reader on the back (the latter available only in some regions). The camera is pretty solid, though it varies by region - you get either 13MP or 8MP. The good news is that both record 1080p video and have Electronic Image Stabilization (plus Photo Booth and Social Square modes). The selfie cam is a 5MP shooter with dedicated flash (it doesn't support face unlock). That's the good news, but in this price range some concessions have to be made. The chipset comes with an unimpressive quad-core processor and the base memory option gives you only 1GB of RAM. You can get an upgrade to 2GB, but the built-in storage is fixed at 16GB in both cases (there is a microSD slot, though). The screen is nothing to write home about with its 480 x 960px resolution, which is a bit low even in the €100 price range. The battery is on the small side with 2,460mAh capacity too. The alcatel 1X will launch in April in single SIM (€100)(R1422,33) and dual SIM (€110)(R1564,56) versions. Some models will have a soft touch Suede finish. Exchange Rate - 1 Euro = R14,22.

Quick look: Android Go on the Alcatel 1X. Hands-on with Alcatel’s new phones at MWC 2018. Posted on February 25, 2018. One of Google’s big initiatives for 2018 is Android Go, a lite version of Android 8 Oreo that is optimized for phones with 1 GB of RAM or less. Android head Hiroshi Lockheimer teased several Android Go devices coming at MWC 2018 and today Alcatel introduced the first one.. Read: Alcatel’s 2018 phone lineup unveiled at MWC. The Alcatel 1X looks and feels as “budget” as you’d expect from a phone that retails for 100 euros, but its saving grace might be the fact that it actually runs Oreo. That’s not something that can be said about most phones out there, including some that cost seven times more than the 1X.. How good is Oreo Go edition on the Alcatel 1X? If you were hoping for the answer to be “smooth as butter,” you’re in for a disappointment. Despite the optimizations and down-sizing, there’s a jankiness to the Alcatel 1X you just can’t get around. Loading the recent apps takes a noticeable moment and there are frequent instances of lag when scrolling through the app drawer or through a webpage.. But! This is a phone that costs less than some people spend on a case! Besides the 1 GB of RAM, the phone features a quad-core MT6739 processor clocked at 1.28 GHz, 16 GB of onboard storage and a 5.3-inch 18:9 “VGA+” display. Considering these specs, it’s actually impressive to see Android 8.1 Oreo in the About section of the settings, and it’s even more impressive that Oreo Go edition is fully serviceable. One other thing to keep in mind is that the phones we tested at the Alcatel pre-briefing were pre-production units, meaning there’s still time for the company to stamp out performance issues before the public release.. The operating system is just a part of the Android Go platform – the other main component is a set of slimmed-down Go apps, including Assistant Go, YouTube Go, and Files Go. We weren’t able to test these apps extensively, but in our short time with them, they did the job just fine. You won’t get the full experience you get with the regular versions, but that’s not really the point of the Go platform.. Android Oreo Go edition addresses one of the biggest problems that plague the low-end of the Android smartphone market, which is the fact that customers rarely get the latest version of Android out of the box. The other big issues are the lack of security patches and the lack of OS updates. The 1X is a mixed bag in this regard: Alcatel says it will receive “regular Android security updates, on a minimum quarterly basis.” That’s not as good as the monthly cadence that high-end phones offer, but it’s a step above what cheap Android phones have offered so far in terms of updates, which is to say, nothing. Unfortunately, Alcatel had nothing to share when it comes to OS updates.. Leaving Android Go edition aside, the Alcatel 1X comes in multiple variants, depending on the market: 1 GB or 2 GB of RAM, single-SIM or dual-SIM, fingerprint sensor or no fingerprint sensor, 8 MP camera or 13 MP camera, and even Google Assistant and no Google Assistant.. The model with 2 GB of RAM features Face Key, a camera-based facial recognition feature. While it’s not as secure as PINs, patterns, or fingerprints, Face Key worked pretty fast and reliably in our time with the phone.. Available in multiple colors starting in April, the Alcatel 1X will start from 99 euros for the single-SIM version and 109 euros for the dual-SIM model.. Read: General Mobile’s Android Go edition phone leaked. At the end of the day, Alcatel and Google managed to put 2018 software on 2013 hardware and made them work together harmoniously, more or less. We look forward to seeing what other manufacturers were able to achieve with Android Go. Stay tuned for more coverage from MWC 2018 in the coming days.. Posted on February 25, 2018. There are plenty of big announcements still coming at MWC, with companies like Samsung and LG sure to make a big splash in the smartphone market. But those aren’t the only phones worth paying attention to. Google recently promised that we’d see Android Go phones at MWC 2018, and Alcatel is the first one to announce one at the trade show. Not only that, Alcatel knows high-end phones aren’t for everybody, which is why the company has announced five new phones in total, all offering solid specs without breaking the bank.. Say hello to the Alcatel 1X, Alcatel 3, Alcatel 3V, Alcatel 3X, and Alcatel 5. We’ll go through all of the devices in detail below, but the unifying theme between them are their 18:9 FullView displays. Alcatel is the first to bring the 18:9 aspect ratio across their entire range of smartphones regardless of price.. The most affordable of the new devices is the Alcatel 1X, which comes in two variants and starts at 99,99 euros for a single-SIM and 109,99 euros for a dual-SIM. Both models have 16 GB of internal storage and a microSD slot that supports up to 32 GB. It comes in either 1 or 2 GB of RAM variants which is questionable for a new phone coming out in 2018, until you realize that they’re running Android 8.1 Oreo (Go Edition) — the new version of Google’s OS that’s optimized to run on devices with less than 1 GB.. The 1 GB version comes with an 8 MP rear shooter while the 2 GB version has a 13 MP camera, and both have an f/2.0 aperture, a 5 MP front-facing camera, and are capable of capturing 1080p video at 30 fps. The 5.3-inch screen has a resolution of 960 x 480 which means you can ditch the bulky phones of the past for a narrow phone that’s easier to hold in the hand. All of this is powered by a 2,460 mAh battery under the hood.. The next phone to be announced is the Alcatel 3, which comes with a few beefed-up specs when compared to the 1X. You’ll also get an 18:9 IPS display, but this one has a resolution of 1,440 x 720 and measures 5.5 inches — slightly larger than the 1X we mentioned above. It has 16 GB of internal memory with microSD card support for up to 128 GB.. On the front you’ll find a 5 MP camera for all your selfie-taking needs. The back camera has a 13 MP sensor and comes with extra features like HDR, panorama, and face recognition. It’s running Android Oreo and has a 3,000 mAh battery that Alcatel claims will provide a solid 17 hours of talk time. It’ll be available next month for 149,99 euros and comes in black, blue, and gold.. Stepping up to the Alcatel 3X you’ll get a 5.7-inch HD+ display with a resolution of 1,440 x 720. The 3X sports a dual-camera setup, one of which being 13 MP while the other is 8 MP. Memory can be expanded up to 128 GB, and internal storage comes in at either 16 or 32 GB variants. In the 32 GB model you’ll find 3 GB of RAM, while the 16 GB model features 2 GB of RAM. Unfortunately this phone runs Android Nougat out of the box, which is a shame as all the other Alcatel phones are running Oreo.. It also comes with a 3,000 mAh battery, estimated for 6 hours of talk time if you’re on 3G. It comes in the same three colors as the other models, but will retail for 179,99 euros upon release.. The second phone in the 3 series is the 3V, which comes with a 6-inch Full HD+ (2,160 x 1,080). The 3V also comes in two storage capacities (16 GB/32 GB) with 2 GB of RAM. The rear camera is a 12 MP shooter and just like the Alcatel 3, this too comes with a 5 MP selfie camera and a 3,000mAh battery that will last you 14 hours of talk time. When it comes out it’ll retail at 189,99 euros and come in three different colors: black, blue, gold.. Rounding out the new devices announced is the Alcatel 5, which again, comes in two variants. The first comes with 32 GB of internal memory and 3 GB of RAM, while the second has 16 GB of storage and 2 GB of RAM. Both models come with a microSD card slot that can take up to a 32 GB card. Unique to the Alcatel 5 is a 13 MP front-facing camera with an f/2.0 aperture, while the back camera is 12 MP. Both cameras feature electronic image stabilization (EIS). Under the hood is Android Nougat and it also has a 3000mAh battery. This model comes in only two colors (black or gold) and comes in at 229,99 euros.. Thoughts on Alcatel’s new phones? Are any catching your eye, or would you go for another affordable device? Let us know in the comments..

Hands-On With The Alcatel 1X, 3V & 5 Android Smartphones – CES 2018. January 9, 2018 - Written By Alexander Maxham. Alcatel is previewing three new lines of smartphones at CES 2018 this week, and will officially launch at Mobile World Congress next month in Barcelona. These include the Alcatel 1X, 3V and 5. These are going to be priced at under $100, under $200 and under $300 respectively. All three are designed mostly the same, although they do have different finishes, but do sport a fingerprint reader on the back and a 18:9 aspect ratio display.. Starting off with the Alcatel 1X, this is the “entry level” model of the three being previewed this week in Las Vegas. It’s going to be priced at under $100 (official pricing won’t be out until next month at MWC). These devices do not have any specs announced, but we do know that it sports a 18:9 aspect ratio display, and it actually looks pretty good. The backside is actually a hybrid of the OnePlus One’s Sandstone and the Nexus 5X’s soft-touch back. It really feels good in the hand. Which is a bit surprising considering its the cheapest model, but feels the best in hand of the three. Considering the Alcatel 3V sports a glass back, and the Alcatel 5 is more of a plastic/faux metal back.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. All three of these smartphones do sport fingerprint sensors on the back, beneath the camera. Though, surprisingly, the Alcatel 3V does sport a dual-camera setup while the Alcatel 5 and 1X do not. A bit surprising since it’s the middle of the three and not the highest-end model. Another interesting difference between the three is the fact that the Alcatel 1X and 3V both sport micro USB ports, and the Alcatel 5 sports a USB-C port. Alcatel did say that there was no technological reason why this was the case, but they felt it was a better decision for consumers to use micro USB for the two lower-end models and stick with USB-C for the higher-end model.. Now Alcatel did mention to us that the three devices are not running on final software right now, and what was running on these three were Android Nougat. Alcatel did say that all three devices will be sporting Android Oreo once it is officially announced next month in Barcelona. But through the quick hands on time that we had with the devices (mind you, they were not connected to the internet, so there wasn’t a lot of things we could do with the software), all three felt pretty smooth, software-wise.. As mentioned, the Alcatel 1X, 3V and 5 are all new series for Alcatel. The company is looking to bring the success of its Idol smartphones to the cheaper price range of phones, which is becoming a pretty popular range these days, with many flagship smartphones nearing that $1000 price, the sub $300 range is gaining a lot of attention recently. But first impressions on this new range from Alcatel is pretty positive. Of course, these were not final, so there will likely be some polish on these before they are made official at Mobile World Congress next month in Barcelona..

Official: Alcatel 1x, 3v And 5 Will Be Announced On Feb. February 16, 2018 - Written By Kristijan Lucic. Alcatel has allowed us to check out. the Alcatel 1X, 3V and 5 at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), even though those three devices were not official at the time. It seems like, however, that they will become official at this year’s Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona. The company suggested earlier that those three handsets will be announced at MWC 2018, and Alcatel just confirmed that it will announce those three devices on February 24.. In the post, Alcatel also shared renders of all three devices, which is not exactly a huge surprise for us, as we’ve already managed to get our hands on all of those devices, even though we still do not have official spec details or anything of the sort. The Alcatel 1x and 3v looks like regular phones, their bezels are not exactly thin, though they’re not overly thick either. The Alcatel 3v, unlike the Alcatel 1x, sports rounded display corners, while you will find physical keys on both this phone’s left and right side, while all the physical keys are included on the right-hand side of the Alcatel 1x. The Alcatel 5 is a completely different story as far as the design is concerned, this handset sports really thin side, and bottom bezels, while its top bezel is quite thick. All of these phones sport a single camera on the back, while a fingerprint scanner is included on the back of each of those phones as well.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. It is worth noting that neither of these three devices will be high-end, or anything of the sort. Alcatel did confirm, to us, that all three phones will ship with Android Oreo, and we also know that the Alcatel 3v will sport a glass back. The Alcatel 1x will be the cheapest of the bunch, as it will cost less than $100. The Alcatel 3v will cost less than $200, while the Alcatel 5 will set you back somewhere between $200 and $300. No official spec info was shared by the company, but if rumors are to be believed, the Alcatel 3v will be fueled by the MediaTek’s MT8735A SoC, while it will also sport 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. The Alcatel 5 , on the other hand, is expected to ship with the MediaTek MT6750 SoC, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of native storage, and a 5.7-inch HD+ display..

Categories Alcatel , Alcatel 1X , Android , Android Oreo , Android Oreo Go Edition Tags Alcatel , Alcatel 1X , Android , Android Go , Android Oreo. Posted on February 25, 2018 February 25, 2018 by Clinton. The Alcatel 1X has been announced at Mobile World Congress and represents the first phone in the new budget focused Android Go program.. The Go program phones are designed to be low cost with basic specs but with the benefit of using the Go lineup of apps and being updated regularly.. The 1X falls squarely in line with the goals.. Mediatek MT6739, the Alcatel 1X has 1GB of RAM and 16GB of storage which can be expanded up to an additional 32GB thanks to the MicroSD slot.. It has a 5.3″ 18:9 ratio display that renders at 480×960.. It has an 8MP main camera and a 5MP selfie cam.. All of this will be around $120 when it is released.. While the specifications of the 1X are not going to set the world alight, the biggest benefit this budget friendly phone has is the updates from Google.. Android updates will be rolled out to the Go phones like the 1X to keep them secure and up-to-date.. That is basically unheard of for budget phones..
