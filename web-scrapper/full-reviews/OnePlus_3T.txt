CNET también está disponible en español.. The Good The OnePlus 3T's battery lasts way longer, takes sharper selfies and has a 128GB storage option.. The Bad Pricier than the OnePlus 3, the 3T now directly competes with better phones.. The Bottom Line This is our new favorite budget Android, but if you have the OnePlus 3, you don't need to upgrade.. Still as fast, and now lasts longer OnePlus 3T Benchmark Scores. Editors' Note : Since the June 2017 release of the OnePlus 5 , OnePlus is phasing out 3T production and will no longer actively sell the phone. You can read CNET's OnePlus 5 review here .. At least, that's what OnePlus is saying with the OnePlus 3T -- a phone that comes just five months after the company launched its OnePlus 3 flagship in June.. The OnePlus 3 was our favorite mid-price phone until this 3T came along. I have no idea why the company is in such a rush to replace its already excellent phone so soon after its launch, but there you have it. And here you have a phone that's the new standout in its category. Oh and don't worry -- the 3 is far from obsolete.. Compared to the 3, the 3T has a darker grey color and a new 128GB storage option (there's also a special-edition black version too). It's got a faster processor, a bigger battery and a better front-facing camera. It's also a smidge more expensive at $439 or £399 for the 64GB variant and $479 or £439 for the 128GB model. (OnePlus isn't available in Australia, but that converts to about AU$580 and AU$632.). For OnePlus 3 owners, don't panic. You're only missing out on a couple hours of extra battery life and better selfies. Plus, all the 3T's new software goodies will soon roll out to 3 owners too. Read on for more details about how the 3T is different (including our spec and price comparison chart at the end), and check out our full OnePlus 3 review for an even deeper dive.. The OnePlus 3T's darker shade of grey. The earlier OnePlus 3 was fast -- it outpaced the Samsung Galaxy S7 , LG G5 and HTC 10 in diagnostic benchmark testing scores. This time around, the 3T beats the 3 in the same benchmarks and is just as fast as the Google Pixel and LeEco LePro 3 -- two newer phones that have the same Snapdragon 821 processor as the 3T.. When it comes to real-world use, the camera opens and snaps a shot in seconds. You'll scroll through a webpage and navigate the phone without lag. The keyboard is as quick and responsive as you'd expect. If you plan to download a lot of apps and fill up storage with photos and video, you may want to get the 128GB version to give yourself some breathing room. A nearly full 64GB phone could slow down operations later on.. OnePlus gave the 3T a bigger battery than the 3: 3,400mAh instead of 3,000mAh. In our lab tests for continuous video playback on Airplane mode, the 3T lasted an average of 16 hours and 56 -- a notable 2.5 hours longer than the 3.. The battery still uses OnePlus' proprietary Dash Charging technology, which charges the battery quickly without overheating. In 30 minutes, the phone charged up to 57 percent, and after an hour, reserves were at 93 percent. A full charge took about 1 hour and 35 minutes. This is about 20 minutes longer than the 3, but that makes sense given the increase in size.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition....

It is the successor to the OnePlus 3 and was revealed on 15 November 2016.. It is an incremental update to the company's flagship phone being released only 6 months later. It features the identical Optic AMOLED display, the same Sony IMX298 rear camera sensor, and the same Dash Charge technology as its predecessor. The OnePlus 3T is also the first phone from OnePlus to be available for immediate delivery (in Europe and North America), without long waiting times from being out of stock. The OnePlus 3T was released on 15 November 2016 via a Facebook live video. [5] It went on sale in a new Gunmetal colour with the Soft Gold option being released soon after much like the OnePlus 3. GB of RAM, the option of 64 or 128. GB of UFS 2.0 storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor that can support the new Daydream VR headset from Google .. To celebrate Colette's 20th anniversary, OnePlus and Colette partnered to produce 250 exclusive limited edition black versions of the phone featuring a Colette logo at the back of the phone. This exclusive edition of the phone went on sale in Paris at a Colette store on 21 March 2017. The OnePlus 3T has the same metal back design, compared with the OnePlus 3, with anodised aluminium and curved edges. The device is available in two colors, a new Gunmetal (black/gray), which is slightly darker than the Graphite color used in the OnePlus 3 and Soft Gold (white/gold) which was released on 6 January 2017. [7] A limited edition Midnight Black colored phone was available to purchase on 28 March 2017, it featured an all black backing similar to the Colette exclusive limited edition but without the logo. The OnePlus 3T's darker aluminium backing is the only physical characteristic that allows it to be distinguished from the OnePlus 3. [9] Users can also purchase the same protective covers in Bamboo, Rosewood, Black Apricot, Karbon and Sandstone, [10] which takes care of the camera hump and evens it with the phone.. It features the same Optic AMOLED display with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection, in the same casing of the OnePlus 3. The OnePlus 3T now comes in options for 64. GB of UFS 2.0 storage. The phone also features the same alert slider which users can use to quickly toggle between alert modes from silent to priority to all notifications. It includes NFC and the same fast finger scanner which can unlock the device in approximately 0.3 seconds. The OnePlus 3T contains the same rear-facing Sony IMX298 sensor with 16 MP, 1.1 μm, f/2.0, Optical image stabilization (OIS) and Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS), as the predecessor. The phone has an upgraded front-facing Samsung 3P8SP sensor with 16 MP, 1.0. The phone once again has the same OnePlus quick charging capabilities named Dash Charge with the ability to gain 60% of the charge in 30 minutes. According to the company, this is accomplished by doing all the power transforming required for direct input to the battery in the power brick supplied, not within the phone itself, reducing heat on the device. Additionally, the power brick can contain larger, dedicated electronics, whereas any power processing on a phone has to use smaller and cooler equipment, reducing the speed of charging.. The phone comes with a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and a bigger 3400. After owners of the phone expressed concern whether their phone would be abandoned after the release of the OnePlus 5 , it was confirmed by Pete Lau, the CEO, that the phone, and its predecessor would eventually receive a software update to Android O. [13] It was also announced that it would be the last major update. [14] As of 19 November 2017, the phone started receiving Android O stable updates [15] .. The OnePlus 3T has the following compatibility. OnePlus 3T generally received a good reception. It was especially praised for its good performance and price to quality ratio. The OnePlus 3T was considered too similar to OnePlus 3 and the increase of the front camera's megapixels was thought to be ineffective in many reviews. Many critics felt the difference was so small that OnePlus 3 owners should not to upgrade to OnePlus 3T. XDA Developers discovered that with the launch of the Android 7.0 Nougat update, OnePlus introduced a software defeat device into the code of the OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus 3T, relaxing thermal throttling and increasing clock speeds when the phone detected that it was in a benchmark app, in order to boost benchmark scores. [20] This came as a bit of a shock to much of the Android enthusiast community, as every major manufacturer had removed their benchmark cheating code following the massive backlash that occurred when it was originally discovered on other devices in 2013. [21] [22] OnePlus immediately stated that they would be removing the benchmark cheating from future software versions, and that they weren't sure how it made it into a production build. [20] OnePlus later reversed this decision with the OnePlus 5, reintroducing the software that locked clock speeds to their maximum while in a benchmark.

Read our hands on OnePlus 5T review OnePlus 3T price No longer on sale - replaced by OnePlus 5 64GB: $439 (£399, around AU$580) 128GB: $479 (£439, around AU$630) Design Premium metal unibody looks and feels great Exactly the same design as OnePlus 3 Read our OnePlus 3 review for the full run-down on the design Display 5.5-inch full HD AMOLED display Great for everything from emails to gaming For more detail on the OnePlus 3T display, read our OnePlus 3 review. Update: Android Oreo has started rolling out for the OnePlus 3T, but if you want a bigger upgrade the OnePlus 5T has also now launched.. The OnePlus 3T is something of a surprise offering.. It’s a phone we didn’t expect the Chinese startup to launch when it unveiled its 2016 flagship, the OnePlus 3 , just six months prior to the 3T’s arrival. The OnePlus 3T has killed off the OnePlus 3 after half a year, but now the 3T is dead as well thanks to the arrival of the OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 5T.. The 3T wasn’t a completely new phone – even OnePlus admits that, instead billing it as new variant of the 3, and too right - the OnePlus 3T has the same design, screen, RAM, rear camera and fingerprint scanner as the phone it’s shoving out of the limelight.. Weight : 158g Dimensions : 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35mm OS : Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow Screen size : 5.5-inch Resolution : 1920 x 1080 CPU : Snapdragon 821 RAM : 6GB Storage : 64/128GB Battery : 3,400mAh Rear camera : 16MP Front camera : 16MP. It’s not like the OnePlus 3 had any major flaws either – it scored a highly respectable 4.5 stars in our in-depth review, and comfortably made it into our list of the top 10 best phones in the world.. So why the new model? OnePlus tells us its engineers found solutions to some nagging issues on the 3, and they didn’t want to wait another six months for the OnePlus 5 launch on June 20, 2017.. That means you’re getting slicker performance, longer battery life, a punchier selfie snapper and a new storage option – at a slightly higher price.. It’s a move that’s likely to frustrate early adopters of the OnePlus 3, as the company they’ve put their faith in has suddenly relegated their handset to a second-class citizen, and relatively soon after its launch.. All that aside though, the OnePlus 3T is another stellar offering, with super performance, a strong feature set and a still-reasonable price tag.. In a rush? Check out our OnePlus 3T video review below!. Update: The OnePlus 3T is no longer on sale. OnePlus has ceased production and removed it from its website. It has been replaced by the OnePlus 5, which itself has now been replaced by the OnePlus 5T - the only phone you can now buy from the firm.. You had to pay more to own a OnePlus handset with the 3T. The firm’s cheaper OnePlus X had been dead for a while, and the OnePlus 3T price started at $439 (£399, around AU$580) for the 64GB model.. That’s up from the $399 (£329, around AU$450) for the OnePlus 3 – but there was another storage/price option with the OnePlus 3T.. OnePlus introduced a new 128GB storage option for its fourth generation flagship, which set you back $479, (£439, around AU$630) – it's a move that will likely delight some users, with the firm continuing to shun expandable memory features such as a microSD slot.. The OnePlus 3T went on sale in the US on November 22, while Europe had to wait a few more days for its OnePlus 3T release date of November 28.. We’re not going to spend too much time talking about the design of the OnePlus 3T. Why? Because it’s identical to the OnePlus 3, and we mean identical.. Same weight (158g), same size (152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35mm), same aluminum uni-body, same rear camera protrusion, same factory fitted (but removable) screen protector…. In fact, the only new feature design-wise is the addition of a new color variant for the 64GB version: gunmetal. This is a darker grey than the silver which adorned the OnePlus 3, and joins ‘soft gold’ to offer two shade choices. The 128GB OnePlus 3T only comes in gunmetal though.. OnePlus introduced a limited edition color for the 128GB model more recently, but the Midnight Black hue has sold out is most regions - so you'll be lucky to get hold of it now.. The OnePlus 3T is still a premium-looking and feeling device, which doesn’t look out of place alongside the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge , iPhone 7 Plus and LG G5 .. However there are newer flagships on the market, and the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6 push the design envelope even further - the OnePlus 3T hasn't been left behind, but it doesn't look quite so good next to 2017's Android flagships.. Considering the OnePlus 3T is comfortably cheaper than all of these handsets though, it’s still rather impressive.. In the run-up to the OnePlus 3T launch there were several reports suggesting the new phone would drop the AMOLED screen technology used on the OnePlus 3 in favor of a LCD screen – luckily that didn’t happen.. This allowed the OnePlus 3T to maintain the same slim profile and bright, vibrant display. The AMOLED panel on the 3T also features the same Full HD resolution, resulting in a 401ppi pixel density.. What that means is text, images and video are clear and smooth – although the display lacks the supreme clarity of the QHD-toting LG G6 and Galaxy S8.. Next Page What’s it like to use?.

The OnePlus 3T makes improvements in all the right places and while this does result in a price hike, the end product and improved user experience certainly makes it worth the extra money..

Dimensions and weight 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35mm. In the past, OnePlus focused on one primary flagship per year,Â. Only six months after the OnePlus 3 was first announced, OnePlus returned again with the OnePlus 3T.Â. As the name suggests, this device is essentially a souped up, or “Turbo” version of the OnePlus 3 that builds on everything we loved about the first, while giving it a slightly more competitive edge against the competition.. A few months later, the first 2017 flagships have started to surface but the OnePlus 3T remains one of the best options on the market, especially for those that are price conscientious. So what exactly does the OnePlus 3T bring to the table, and how does it compare to the OnePlus 3, as well as more recent competition? Let’s dive in and find out.. As far as the design is concerened, the OnePlus 3T looks exactly like its older sibling, and features the same full metal unibody construction, with a slightly curved back and rounded sides and corners. Despite being made entirely of metal, the phone is surprisingly light, and because the back tapers along the edges, it feels thinner as well, making for a device that is very comfortable to hold.. It’s also not a very tall or wide phone and is only slightly larger than the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge , allowing for a comfortable one-handed experience despite coming with a 5.5-inch display. There isn’t any 3T logo anywhere on the device that explicitly indicates that this is the upgraded flagship, and the only way to to really distinguish it from the older OnePlus 3 is by the color.. The OnePlus 3T is available in the same gold variant as the OnePlus 3, but the second color option is gunmetal instead of silver. The gunmetal version comes with both 64 and 128 GB options, while the gold iteration only comes with 64 GB of on-board storage.. As was the case with the OnePlus 3, build quality is not an issue here, and everything is very well put together. Taking a look around the device, the power button and volume rocker are on the right and left sides respectively, and the buttons feel very tactile and are easy to press. Above the volume rocker is the very useful Notification Slider, that lets you quickly toggle between silent, do not disturb, and full volume options.. At the bottom is the headphone jack, the USB Type-C port, and the single speaker unit, and up front is the home button with the integrated fingerprint scanner, flanked by capacitive back and Recent Apps keys. The back key is on the left and the Recent Apps key is on the right by default, but you can flip the orientation if you prefer in the Settings.. Things remain unchanged on the display side, with the OnePlus 3T also coming with a 5.5-inch AMOLED display with a 1080p resolution. As is expected from an AMOLED screen, you get rich and vibrant colors with a lot of contrast, and the optional dark mode that is built-in to Oxygen OS takes fanastic advantage of the deep inky blacks. If you aren’t a fan of the vibrancy though, it is also easy to switch to a sRGB color mode in the Display Settings that provides a more natural and less saturated look.. Brightness isn’t a concern and allows for comfortable outdoor visibility. Sharpness isn’t a problem either, and to the naked eye, the difference between this 1080p panel and other Quad HD screen won’t be noticeable, unless you are using the phone for VR. OnePlus feels that VR isn’t mainstream enough to justify the jump to Quad HD, and decided to stick to 1080p to aid with the battery life.. There aren’t a whole lot of differences between the OnePlus 3 and the 3T, but performance is one area that has seen an improvement. Under the hood, the OnePlus 3T comes with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, clocked at 2.35 GHz, which is faster than the one found in the Google Pixel smartphones. The 3T retains the 6 GB of RAM that is also available with the OnePlus 3.. Not surprisingly, the performance is absolutely fantastic with the OnePlus 3T, with the comparatively lower resolution display a contributing factor as well. Opening, closing, and switching between apps is smooth and snappy, the touch responsiveness is excellent, and the device also handles graphic-intensive gaming comfortably, with no dropped frames to be seen.. With 6 GB of RAM, multitasking isn’t an issue either, and you can have a lot of apps in running the background and keep them for a very long time. The OnePlus 3T features one of the quickest and smoothest Android experiences out there. Granted, it may not be as smooth as the experience available with the Pixel devices, but it is certainly up there among the best.. As mentioned, 64 GB and 128 GB are the internal storage options available, but if storage is a concern, users will have to opt for the higher variant, with expandable storage via microSD card not being available. Getting the 128 GB model means that you will also get the new gunmetal color.. The fingerprint sensor that is integrated into the home button up front does unlock the device really quickly, but it is unfortunately not the most accurate scanner out there. It is fairly reliable, but there have been quite a few instances where it misreads my fingerprint. You can also add a variety of long press and double tap functions to the home button and the capacitive keys.. Another area where the OnePlus 3T has received an upgrade is in the battery department, with the device coming with a 3,400 mAh battery, which is a slight bump when compared to the 3,000 mAh unit available with the OnePlus 3. The 13% bump in battery capacity is more impressive when you consider the fact that OnePlus was able to achieve it without making the phone any heavier or thicker than its namesake.. OnePlus’ Dash Charge technology is available here to quickly get the phone back up to a full charge. The biggest advantage with this technology however is that the majority of the heat that is generated during charging is contained in the wall adapter and doesn’t make its way to the device. This also means that you can use the phone while it is charging, without worrying about the charging speeds being throttled in order to control the device temperature.. OnePlus claims that you can get a full day of battery life after charging the device for just half an hour. In my experience, that translates to a charge to 60% in half an hour, which is certainly impressive, and very useful if you don’t have a lot of time to fully charge your phone.. As far as the battery life is concerned, the overall experience has been extremely good. The phone easily lasts all day even with my fairly heavy usage, which typically consists of several hours of gaming, watching videos on Youtube, and streaming music, throughout the day. So, while this bump in battery capacity may seem small, it seems to make a significant difference to the battery life.. The final area that has seen an upgrade from the OnePlus 3 is with the camera, but this change is more focused on the front-facing shooter, which is now a 16 MP unit, which is double the 8 MP sensor that was found with the OnePlus 3. The rear camera is the same 16 MP unit that was availableÂ. with the OnePlus 3, and Â. comes with a f/2.0 aperture, optical image stabilization, and phase detection autofocus.. The front-facing camera also comes with an f/2.0 aperture, which helps a lot when taking selfies in low-light conditions. With the bump in megapixel count, you will also have a lot more room to zoom and crop without any deterioration in the quality of the picture, and also enjoy sharper looking video. Overall, you get a far better experience with the front-facing shooter now than you did with the OnePlus 3.. The default camera app is pretty similar to the Google Camera, with many of the same modes to be found here, including Timelapse, Slow motion, and Panorama. The only exception is that manual controls are available if you are looking to dial in the setting yourself, but it is otherwise a very nicely laid out and easy to use camera application.. This is definitely a good camera with it comes to picture quality. Photos are crisp and well detailed, and I really like the color reproduction. You get nice, natural looking colors, and the images are sharp enough, but without looking oversharpened and artificial. If you do want some extra sharpening, the HQ mode is available, which adds a fairly noticeable amount of sharpening to the photos. However, the images looked fine in most situations, and I rarely had to use this feature.. In terms of dynamic range, the camera does have a tendency to overexpose the shot and blow out a lot of the highlights, but HDR mode alleviates this problem easily. It does a great job of pulling extra detail from the highlights and shadows, while still maintaining the natural look of the original image. Low-light shots can be good, but onl when using the HQ mode. Without it, images are noisy and soft, and the mode allows for sharper, more detailed images that are a lot cleaner.. On the software side of things, the OnePlus 3T is running the latest Oxygen OS 3.5.1 based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and you get a very stock Android look and feel here, but with a lot of customizations available that add to the experience without getting in the way.. Shelf is still accessible by swiping to the left of the home screen, and holds a lot of information, including the weather info and your recent contacts or used apps. You can also compose memos and manage your data, storage, and battery life, and there any widget can be added here, instead of having them take up space on the other home screens.. A few new customization options have been added to the latest version of the Oxygen OS, such as a built-in night mode, that makes the viewing the screen easier on your eyes at night. There are custom accent colors, support for third party icon packs, and the screen off gestures like double tap to wake, or the ability to launch the camera or flashlight by drawing on O or a V on the screen.. You can truly tailor the experience to exactly the way you like it, and that is one of the best parts about Oxygen OS. This updated version introduces some new features to further refine the experience. You can now swipe down on the screen with three fingers to take a screenshot, and add a password or use your fingerprint to lock down any application.. Despite still being based on Android Marshmallow, OnePlus has also updated the notification shade to the Android 7.0 Nougat style that comes with easy access to the Quick Settings with one downward swipe. OnePlus hasn’t announced a specific date as to when an official update to Android 7.0 Nougat will be available, but it is slated for the end of the year, and will be made available for both the OnePlus 3 and 3T.. The faster processor, an improved front-facing camera, and larger battery capacity also results in a bump in the price point, with the 64 GB model priced at $439, and the 128 GB iteration setting you back an additional $40. The OnePlus 3T will be available on November 22 in the US and November 28 in Europe.. So, there you have it for this in-depth look at the OnePlus 3T review! If you already have the OnePlus 3, the 3T really isn’t compelling enough to justify an upgrade. The improvements are nice, but the overall experience isn’t significantly different between the two, and if software updates are a concern, the good news is that both devices will receive them at the same time.. On the other hand, those who have been waiting to see what Google had to offer with their smartphones and were holding off on buying the OnePlus 3 will certainly be elated.Â. Given the upgrades, the $40 and $80 difference in price from the OnePlus 3 is completely understandable, and still undercuts a lot of other flagships. What you get for the money does make the OnePlus 3T one of the best deals you can get for an Android flagship, and is a smart move by the company.. It also holds pretty well against the competition, even more expensive options, and remains among our list of best Android smartphones available right now.. OnePlus 3T , Smartphone Reviews.

What comes after the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T ? Surprise, it’s the OnePlus 5 !. Yes OnePlus is skipping the number four due to the phenomenon of tetraphobia in its home country. But the name isn’t important when you consider the OnePlus 5 is the company’s most ambitious and most expensive smartphone to date.. So what are the biggest changes and - more importantly - is the OnePlus 5 still a smartphone bargain? Let’s take a look…. OnePlus 5 (left) vs OnePlus 3T (right). The latter is visually identical to the OnePlus 3. Like the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T (and in fact like every previous generation of OnePlus), the OnePlus 5 sports a 5.5-inch OLED display with 1080p native resolution:. But look closely and you will spot a difference. The OnePlus 5 screen is slightly stronger as it supports Gorilla Glass 5 (which is better at resisting cracks from drops) and there are also minor upgrades to the screen brightness, even if this won’t compete with top OLED panels like those found in the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus .. OnePlus 5 has an improved LCD display but it cannot match the best OLEDs. Does the 1080p resolution matter? Not in my opinion. The 401ppi display is still nearly 5x more dense than a 50-inch Ultra HD 4K television and even the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus default to 1080p by default - so you’ll survive.. Design & Size - Eerily Familiar. Like the display, there’s also not a great deal of difference in the size and weight of the OnePlus 5 compared to its immediate predecessors:. Despite this, the look has changed a fair bit. The OnePlus 5 does still sport a metal unibody providing decent grip, but the edges and corners are more rounded to make it nicer to hold while the antenna lines are repositioned to be less visible.. OnePlus 5 has greater curvature on its edges for better feel in hand. Unlike an increasing number of phones, a physical home button under the display but at the back you’ll now find a dual rear camera which has shifted to the side making it look like an iPhone 7 Plus.. OnePlus 5 colour options are limited at present with just Midnight Black and Slate Gray compared to the OnePlus 3T which also came in Gunmetal and Soft Gold, but expect this choice to expand in time.. The dual camera on the OnePlus 5 is its headline feature. With the relatively subtle changes to the OnePlus 5 display and design, it is up to the camera to provide the biggest upgrade from the OnePlus 3T and OnePlus 3:. The upshot however is the OnePlus 5 can deliver 2x optical zoom ( via a slight cheat ) and combine both its rear camera to deliver a Portrait Mode (think heavy background bokeh to mimic the effect of a DSLR) similar to the iPhone 7 Plus.. Portrait Mode on the OnePlus 5. Aside from party tricks, OnePlus claims the OnePlus 5’s increased aperture means it can capture 34% more light than the OnePlus 3T and OnePlus 3 (which share the same single rear camera) for better low light shots. It can also focus up to 40% faster.. Meanwhile the OnePlus 5 has the same core specifications for its front camera as the OnePlus 3T, though the latter only delivered this upgrade seven months ago to address the fairly unremarkable front camera in the OnePlus 3.. Performance - Blowing The Competition Away. While the dual camera will grab the headlines, for many the real appeal of the OnePlus 5 will be its incredible performance:. Yes just like Samsung’s (US Edition) Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus, the OnePlus 5 packs a top of the range Qualcomm 835 chipset. The 835 only delivers 10% greater CPU performance and 21% greater GPU performance than the 820, but it is also up to 25% more efficient.. OnePlus 5 is the fastest Android phone currently available. But what really catches the eye is the option of a massive 8GB of RAM (128GB version only) in combination with Oxygen OS, which is the company’s wonderfully clean and streamlined take on stock Android.. The result is a smartphone which feels considerably faster than Samsung’s new Galaxies and LG’s G6 with only Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL holding their own. Given the price difference between the OnePlus 5 and such premium rivals (more later) this is a big selling point.. Battery Life & Charging - One Step Back, One Step Forward. Rather surprisingly the OnePlus 5 actually features a smaller battery than the OnePlus 3T:. Is this a disaster? Potentially not. The good news is OnePlus claims efficiencies in both hardware and software mean in practice the OnePlus 5 will actually last 20% longer than the OnePlus 3T - but that will depend on how you are using the phone (gaming vs reading emails, for example).. Personally I think it’s an opportunity missed not fitting a bigger battery to really stun the competition.. Dash Charge is faster than any rival charger, particular when the phone is in use. You also won’t find wireless charging. But Dash Charge is carried over from its predecessors and is still the fastest smartphone charging system around, especially while using your phone at the same time. It’s just a shame you will need the company’s specific Dash Charger plugs and cables to achieve this.. Storage & Price - A Significant Increase. What made OnePlus famous is its combination of top line features and incredibly aggressive pricing. This isn’t quite so clear cut now the OnePlus 5 has had a significant price rise - particular in the UK and Europe:. At $479 the entry level OnePlus 5 is a notable increase on the OnePlus 3 in particular, and the 128GB / 8GB RAM model for another $60 is the better deal in my opinion.. Of course $539 remains a lot to ask for a smartphone and it certainly takes the OnePlus range outside the almost impulse-buy territory of the original OnePlus One ($299). But what works in the phone’s favour are the price increases by rivals.. The Galaxy S8 ($750) increased $100 on the Galaxy S7 and both the Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone 8 are expected to cost over $1,000. At these price points the OnePlus 5 is still a relative bargain, but if the company increases the price again next year it could prove problematic.. OnePlus 5 is the best OnePlus ever made, but not the best value. The OnePlus 5 is a solid, if not spectacular, upgrade on the OnePlus 3T and OnePlus 3. For my money there’s not enough reason to upgrade from the former but it will provide value for owners of the latter.. I’m not fully convinced the dual camera gimmickry in the OnePlus 5 does enough to justify the price increase and I’d have liked to see a larger battery, but this remains a premium phone sold well below the price of the company’s most famous rivals.. The OnePlus 5 has done it again - just.. Follow Gordon on Twitter , Facebook and Google+. OnePlus 3T Vs OnePlus 3: What’s The Difference?.

The OnePlus 3T isn't a huge improvement over the already-solid OnePlus 3, but it's still a well-rounded unlocked phone with buttery smooth performance, long battery life, and highly customizable software.

PCMag reviews products independently , but we may earn affiliate commissions from buying links on this page.. View All 11 Photos in Gallery. Clean UI and highly customizable software. Same screen resolution as the OnePlus 3, and less sharp than the competition. The OnePlus 3T isn't a huge improvement over the already-solid OnePlus 3, but it's still a well-rounded unlocked phone with buttery smooth performance, long battery life, and highly customizable software.. Well, that was fast! The OnePlus 3T, available in 64GB ($439) and 128GB ($479) models, has arrived to replace the $399 OnePlus 3 , which was just released this summer. With the 3T, you get the very latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor complemented by 6GB of RAM, making the phone one of the fastest we've tested. Camera performance has improved with a higher megapixel front sensor, the already excellent battery life is even longer, and the software remains highly customizable. If you have a OnePlus 3, you'll probably want to hold onto it, but if you're in the market for a new unlocked phone , the OnePlus 3T is a solid alternative to the ZTE Axon 7 and a much more affordable option than the Google Pixel XL. Put the OnePlus 3T next to the OnePlus 3 and you won't be able to tell the difference. The two phones are physically identical, sharing the same metal unibody build, and same button and port placement. They can even use the same cases and accessories (including the OnePlus Loop VR headset), and both phones are available in gray or gold, though the gray 3T is slightly darker (pictured below).. Unsurprisingly, the two phones are identically sized at 6.0 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and both weigh 5.6 ounces, putting the 3T in the same size and weight class as phablet-size metal slabs like the Pixel XL (6.1 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 5.9 ounces) and the Axon 7 (6.0 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches, 6.2 ounces). I find it a bit too wide and tall to reach everything with my thumb, making it difficult to use with one hand, especially since there's no option to resize the screen.. As mentioned, the ports and buttons are the same as those on the OnePlus 3. On the right panel, there's a dual SIM card slot with a power button below it. The bottom has a 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB-C port, and a fairly loud bottom-firing speaker. The left edge houses a handy alert slider letting you quickly and easily switch between Ring, Silent, and Do Not Disturb modes.. View All 11 Photos in Gallery. The display is a 5.5-inch 1,920-by-1,080 Optic AMOLED panel, the same resolution as the previous generation phone's with the same pixel density (401ppi). That means the Quad HD panels on the Axon 7 (538ppi) and Pixel XL (534ppi) are both significantly sharper. It's a pity that given its higher price point, OnePlus chose not to bump up display resolution.. That said, the screen is nothing to scoff at. Maximum brightness has been tamped up and color calibration improved. Colors are accurate, but also vivid when using the default sRGB mode, and customization options are available to make color temperature warmer or cooler. Outdoor visibility is excellent thanks to the combination of high maximum brightness and a polarizing layer between the screen and the protective pane of Gorilla Glass 4. Using the OnePlus 3T side-by-side with the Pixel XL, I never noticed the difference in display resolution. The one exception is that if you're using a VR headset you'll notice more pixelation on the 3T.. On the lip below the display, you'll find a fingerprint scanner that doubles as a capacitive home button with back and recent buttons on either side. There are various programmable functions (launching the camera, opening a previously used app, bringing up voice assistant, etc.) you can enable for each button with either a long press or a double tap. Other customization options include swapping the order of the buttons or turning them off entirely in favor of the on-screen navigation bar.. Despite its rich array of features, the OnePlus 3T isn't protected from submersion in water. And while neither the Pixel XL nor the Axon 7 offer this feature, it's becoming more common on flagship phones and would have been a nice addition here.. As an unlocked phone supporting LTE bands 1/2/4/5/7/12/17/30, the OnePlus 3T shares the same network compatibility as its predecessor, and will work with GSM carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile without any trouble, but unlike the Pixel XL, there's no support for CDMA carriers including Sprint and Verizon. The X12 modem is also limited to the same Category 6 LTE speeds as the OnePlus 3, so in our testing it proved to be slower than the Pixel XL, which can support speeds up to Category 12 (once that kind of coverage exists). That said, network speeds were still good when we tested the phone on AT&T in midtown Manhattan, averaging 15Mbps down. Other connectivity protocols include dual-band Wi-Fi, NFC, and Bluetooth 4.2.. The phone also supports two SIM cards, allowing us to make calls using two separate phone numbers, a handy feature for work or travel, and one that's fairly uncommon in the US. Unfortunately, the second SIM slot isn't also compatible with microSD cards, which would arguably be more useful for most people.. Call quality was great in our tests. Transmissions come across with clear and audible tones, with strong noise cancellation that blots out most background noise. Earpiece and speakerphone volume are both quite loud and can be used to carry on a conversation in a noisy environment.. The OnePlus 3T is powered by the very latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor clocked at 2.35GHz, has 6GB RAM and UFS 2.0 flash storage under the hood. All of this makes for one of the fastest phones we've tested. The 3T scored an impressive 159,144 on AnTuTu, which measures overall system performance. It beats the Snapdragon 820-powered OnePlus 3 by a significant amount (141,429), as well as the Axon 7 (141,989). On Geekbench, the 3T has an excellent single core and multi-core scores 1881/4276, outperforming the Pixel XL (1661/4146), though not by very much.. Unsurprisingly, real world use is buttery smooth. Launching apps and multitasking is so quick it feels almost instantaneous, and during testing, I was never able to put the phone under enough strain to make it stutter. Games like GTA San Andreas and Asphalt 8 run without any hint of latency or dropped frames.. See How We Test Cell Phones. Battery life is stellar thanks to the large 3,400mAh cell combined with a relatively undemanding display. The phone outlasted our 10-hour test video in which we stream full-screen video over LTE while set to maximum brightness. At the end of the test, we still had 5 percent charge remaining. That gives the OnePlus 3T one of the longest runtimes among the phones we've tested, matching the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and handily beating the Pixel XL (6 hours, 43 minutes) and the Axon 7 (6 hours) by several hours. Enabling the Battery Saver feature will also improve runtime by turning off vibration, location services, and most background data. And the proprietary Dash Charger allows the phone to be charged to full in less than an hour.. The 3T has matching 16-megapixel cameras on the front and the back, but the one on the rear also supports optical image stabilization (OIS) and 4K video recording. Generally, the camera performance of the rear sensor hasn't changed significantly from the OnePlus 3. It's still a fast, crisp shooter outdoors and in other well-lit settings. There's no noise to be found in pictures taken outside, the camera app is quick to launch, and autofocus is fast and accurate.. That said, low-light shooting is still not exceptional. While the 3T manages a respectable level of clarity in darker settings, a shootout with the Pixel XL emphasizes its shortcomings. With a 1.12 -micron pixel size, the 3T simply can't gather as much light as the larger 1. 55 -micron pixels on the Pixel XL. That means despite the lack of OIS, the Pixel XL can take clearer, less grainy, and better-lit photos when snapping in Auto HDR mode. The rear sensor is capable of recording video in 4K at 30fps. It's smooth and fairly stable, but in a testament to Google's impressive software optimization, the Pixel XL was more stable during testing despite only offering electronic image stabilization.. The quality of the front-facing camera is top notch. Thanks to its high megapixel count, I was able to take some exceptionally crisp selfies and video, and auto exposure adjusted well to account for lighting conditions indoors and outdoors.. Overall, the Pixel XL has a better and more reliable sensor, at least with regard to its rear camera and video recording. The 3T can hold its own in daylight shots, though, and it has more options to fine tune photos with m anual controls. You can tweak ISO, white balance, focus, shutter speed, and other settings. You can also shoot in Raw for higher quality images.. The OnePlus 3T comes running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with its OxygenOS skin. It's a bit disappointing the phone doesn't have Nougat yet, but OnePlus has promised it will be coming by the end of the year. OxygenOS live up to its name by being a lightweight skin with a look that should be immediately familiar Nexus users. App icons haven't changed, nor has the notification shade, or app drawer. The only immediately distinguishable difference is that when you swipe left from the home screen you get Shelf, OnePlus' custom home screen. Shelf shows you your favorite apps, most frequent contacts, and recent photos, also giving you the option of adding additional widgets.. But what really sets apart OxygenOS is its customization options. It offers a built-in manager for themes, custom app icon support, rearrangeable buttons, and different accents and colors for the Settings menu and status bar, including a spiffy-looking dark theme. You can also lock individual apps and require a password or fingerprint verification to unlock them, useful for sensitive selfies. Gesture support is also on board, allowing you to double tap to wake, draw on the screen to open the flashlight and use a three finger swipe to take a screenshot.. Swiftkey is integrated as one of the available keyboards (the other is Google's), but the phone asks permission before enabling either. Aside from that, there's a File Manager, Weather app, and Voice Recorder, all of which I found useful. Out of a total of 128GB of storage, 13GB is occupied by the OS and UI, leaving you with 115GB free. It's an ample amount of space, making up for the lack of expandable storage.. OnePlus has come a long way since the invite only days of the OnePlus One and OnePlus 2. At $440 the OnePlus 3T is the most expensive phone the company has ever made, but it's also the fastest. The smooth performance combined with long-lasting battery life, an improved front camera, and clean and customizable UI make it an excellent choice. However, depending on storage capacity, the ZTE Axon 7 is $40 to $80 less, while offering largely similar performance with a higher-resolution screen, thundering front-facing speakers, and high-quality audio.. The Google Pixel XL retains its Editors' Choice status for its excellent camera, unbeatable voice assistant, 24/7 live support, and a guarantee of reliable Android updates. But if some of those aspects aren't important to you, then the 3T could be a compelling option, costing nearly half as much with slightly better performance and a much longer battery life.. Bottom Line: The OnePlus 3T isn't a huge improvement over the already-solid OnePlus 3, but it's still a well-rounded unlocked phone with buttery smooth performance, long battery life, and highly customizable software..

I write about technology's biggest companies. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. Snapdragon 820 chipset: Quad-core Kryo CPU, Adreno 530 CPU, 6GB RAM. OnePlus 3T - Qualcomm Snapdragon 821: Quad-core Kyro CPU, Adreno 530 CPU, 6GB RAM. OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T - 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.4 mm (6.01 x 2.94 x 0.29 in) and 158 g (5.57 oz). OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T - 5.5-inch, Optic AMOLED panel, 1080 x 1920 pixels (401 ppi pixel density) and Corning Gorilla Glass 4. OnePlus 3T - from $439 (64GB, 128GB). The OnePlus 3 is, without doubt, one of 2016’s very best smartphones because it offers true flagship performance at half the price of most rivals. But just five months after release OnePlus has controversially announced an upgraded version called the ‘OnePlus 3T’.. So what are the differences between the OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus 3T and should you be angry or excited and eager to upgrade? Let’s take a look…. The OnePlus 3T is visually identical to the OnePlus 3 but has a new darker grey 'gunmetal' colour option. The headline addition to the OnePlus 3T is its improved performance thanks to an upgraded chipset:. Yes on paper this doesn’t look a major change and synthetic benchmarks don’t show a major difference between the 821 and the 820 - but the key here is efficiency. The Snapdragon 821 runs much cooler than the 820 so it doesn’t throttle as much and can consistently run at full speed when needed. It also uses less power helping to preserve battery life and has specific optimisation for traditional Android weak spots like web browsing scrolling.. The OnePlus 3T is just as slim as the OnePlus 3. How the OnePlus 3T performance compares to the lightning fast Snapdragon 821-equipped Google Pixel will be fascinating to see since many of the Pixel’s improvements were claimed to stem from Android 7.1 when the 3T will (disappointingly) ship with Android 6.0.1.. The OnePlus 3T also features an enhanced camera over the OnePlus 3, but not where you might expect.. While the decent 16MP and 4K video capable rear shooter of the OnePlus 3T adds ‘Intelligent Pixel Technology’ which reduces noise in low light, plus a sapphire lens and improved EIS (electronic image stabilisation) the core Sony sensor with f/2.0 aperture remain the same.. The OnePlus 3 has a tweaked rear camera and major front camera upgrade over the OnePlus 3. Instead the bigger change is to the front camera which makes the jump from 8MP to 16MP and adds ‘smile capture’ for automated snap taking when you grin. OnePlus promises a major advance in image quality here which could be a big hit with the selfie obsessed, as long as it bears out.. Battery Life & Charging - A Welcome Bump. The OnePlus 3T also ups the ante on its older brother with a welcome 13% increase in battery capacity that sees it now close on rivals like the Galaxy S7 Edge (3600 mAh) and Google Pixel XL (3450 mAh):. More frustrating, however, is OnePlus continues with its proprietary ‘Dash Charge’ technology which is incompatible with Qualcomm’s popular Quick Charge alternative and the native USB 3.1 standard Google is starting to push handset makers to adopt on all Android phones going forward. This fracturing of standards (and therefore chargers) hurts what should be one of Android’s biggest advantages over the iPhone.. OnePlus uses 'Dash Cash' which is frustratingly proprietary but very fast, particularly when the phone is in use while charging. That said where Dash Charge excels is the speed of its charging while using the phone. Most Android fast charging options are extremely quick while the phone is inactive, but slow significantly when the phone is in use. Design & Size - Eerily Familiar. OnePlus has chosen not to change the external design of the OnePlus 3 with the OnePlus 3T by even millimetre or gram:. While perhaps dull, I’d argue this is a good thing since you’ll find the same high quality aluminium chassis on the 3T which feels good in hand and provides a more tactile grip than the competition. The colours have been tweaked slightly so you’ll now have ‘gunmetal’ replacing ‘graphite’ (it’s a darker grey) while the soft gold option remains.. The OnePlus 3T display is perfectly good, but it is unchanged from the OnePlus 3 and doesn't compete with the best smartphones. Displays - Same Old, Same Old. The OnePlus 3 doesn’t have the best display on the market (it’s perhaps one area where its budget roots start to show) and this also hasn’t been changed with the OnePlus 3T:. OnePlus did issue a firmware update shortly after the OnePlus 3 was released to address inaccurate colours and this panel is unlikely disappoint in isolation. Especially when considering the biggest selling point for both phones…. Storage & Price - Justifiable Rise. Yes the OnePlus 3T is more expensive than its predecessor, but not by much considering the core improvements to speed, camera and battery life. Power users will also find a new 128GB option.. The OnePlus 3T will go on sale in the US on November 22nd and in the UK on November 28th.. The OnePlus 3T is slightly more expensive than the OnePlus 3, but it's still incredible value. OnePlus is likely to be both criticised for upgrading a five month old phone and praised for committing to the bleeding edge for only a moderate price rise. I can see both sides to this, but I lean towards the latter.. As such if you have a OnePlus 3 there’s not enough reason to upgrade to a OnePlus 3T, but if you’re on the lookout for a new phone and are targeting a bargain then the OnePlus 3T looks set to be the best of them all..

Android 6.0.1 with OxygenUI (updated to Android 7). – A side of Nougat and new Midnight Black edition. OnePlus has released a matte-black version of the excellent 3T. Like the iPhone 7 before it, dark black is probably the perfect colour for a phone and the new 3T looks fab. It’s only available in limited amounts, and in 128GB varieties, but it’s still an excellent value phone.. It comes in a nice black and red box.. Both the front and back are sleek black, and it looks fantastic.. The back has a similar feeling to the dark black iPhone 7.. OnePlus has also been rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat to its OnePlus 3T phones over the past few weeks. I’ve had it for just over a week now, but by all accounts it’s a staggered release so don’t be surprised if you’re still waiting for Nougat on your 3T.. With the update, things now look a little different to what I’d grown accustomed to having used the OnePlus 3T as my main phone since its original release.. The first thing I noticed had changed was the lockscreen notifications and the notification shade, which have both seen a design update.. In keeping with OnePlus’ light-handed touch to customising Android, it’s what you’ll see on other Nougat-powered smartphones such as Google’s Pixel devices. The changes mean you can reply from the notification shade in a more intuitive, in-line manner.. There’s now a whole extra row of icons on the homescreen, too. As a result, you get a 4×5 grid over the previous 4×4 one, and icons are able to make much better use of the phone’s screen.. Changes are abound in the Settings menu, too. Everything’s now had a lick of blue paint and you get a bit of contextual information for each settings section, such as how much duration you can expect from the battery.. New emojis have also been introduced, so if you’re sick of seeing the little “X” box being sent to you from iPhone users, you’ll finally be able to see those little taco or cowboy emojis you’ve been missing out on all this time.. Nougat’s other big feature is its Multi Window support, which makes it to the OnePlus 3T – but not in the manner I was expecting. Normally, you hold the Overview button – the one that brings up your recent apps – to open up the Multi Window interface to choose which apps to open side-by-side.. On the OnePlus 3T, you bring the recent apps carousel up but hold one of the open app cards and drag it to one side of the screen. Unfortunately, Multi Window isn’t supported by every app at present and depending on what apps you use, can feel a little cramped.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

It still feels incredibly nippy and doesn’t succumb to slow down or judder. If anything, it feels like it might be slightly snappier with Nougat.. Battery life has also held up, and I can still easily last a day without worrying about carrying a charger with me. It’s hard to tell how much improvement, if any, there has been from the upgraded Doze feature in Android Nougat, however.. For me, the OnePlus 3T remains a phenomenal phone for the money, and the addition of Nougat only improves on it.. You can read TrustedReviews’ original OnePlus 3T review below.. The OnePlus 3T is to the OnePlus 3 what the iPhone 6S was to the iPhone 6. It looks very much the same, but there are some seriously welcome upgrades under the body.. Key changes include a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, 13% larger battery capacity and improved front-facing camera. But, with the pricing now starting at £399, do the changes justify 3T’s increased upfront cost? Fortunately for OnePlus, the answer is largely yes, which is doubly good news as the OnePlus 3 is being discontinued.. Not a great deal has changed here. There are now two colour options, a new Gunmetal finish or Soft Gold, although if you want the new larger 128GB capacity option you’re limited to only Gunmetal. The Gunmetal option replaces the previous Graphite finish available with the OnePlus 3 and is a little darker in shade.. Outside of this, the OnePlus 3T remains 7.4mm thick and is made from a single slab of aluminium alloy that feels lovely in hand. OnePlus made a big deal about how the top of the frame curves differently from the rest of the edges. It’s not something you’re going to notice unless you go looking for it, but it’s still a nice touch.. Look to the bottom of the phone and you’ll find a neatly drilled speaker grille, a USB-C port and a headphone jack. The latter is worth drawing attention to as, despite Apple’s efforts to kill the 3.5mm jack, no one seems to be in a great rush to make USB-C headphones over Lightning headphones.. I’m actually all for moving away from the 3.5mm jack and use Bluetooth headphones more often than not, but there are still times when I want to use a wired connection beyond headphones. Too often I went to plug the jack-less Moto Z into my car radio only to remember I’d left the adaptor connected to my wired headphones back home. It’s a frustration I can do without.. Along the left edge is a three-level Alert Slider to toggle between notification profiles. You can either have them all, priority or none, just like the OnePlus 3. It’s a useful addition you don’t see often. Below this is the volume rocker, and on the opposite side the power button.. There’s a front fingerprint sensor, which I’ve always stated is my preferred position over a rear placement. The fingerprint sensor also doubles as the Home button, flanked by capacitive Back and Recent keys that are only marked by a backlit dot, rather than their standard icons. This is because you can swap their positions in the OnePlus 3T’s settings.. The button setup is similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7 ‘s, and means you can do away with Android’s on-screen navigation buttons, freeing up more of the display. You can still turn on the on-screen navigation in the settings if you want.. Having a choice is great and the customisation options don’t end there, on the 3T you can also choose different shortcut actions for double-press and hold inputs for any of the capacitive buttons.. The fingerprint sensor feels responsive and on a par with other great fingerprint sensors, such as the Huawei P9 ‘s, when it comes to swiftness. It does fall afoul of the same pitfalls as all other fingerprint sensors I’ve used though, so wet hands will still see you resorting to more traditional unlock methods.. Turn the OnePlus 3T over and you’ll see a moderate camera bump from the protruding rear camera. It’s not as pronounced as on certain other phones though and OnePlus has also made improvements here by coating the sensor in sapphire glass, for an extra level of resilience.. The OnePlus 3T supports dual SIMs, useful if you have a personal and work number and don’t want to carry multiple devices. The second SIM slot does not double as a microSD card slot, as is the case with certain other phones, so there’s no expandable storage, just like the OnePlus 3.. But as mentioned, there is now 64GB (£399) and 128GB (£439) capacity options. The extra for 128GB isn’t a complete rip-off compared to what others have charged for extra storage, either. Otherwise, NFC makes a welcome return so you can use Android Pay.. The 3T’s 5.5-inch screen is on paper identical to the OnePlus 3’s. It has the same 1,920 x 1,080 resolution and uses the same Optic AMOLED technology. That’s not going to amount to the highest pixels-per-inch density in the world, but with general use it’s not something you’re going to notice.. The Optic AMOLED tech means black levels are superb and the display still looks super sharp, regardless of its comparably low pixels-per-inch count. Viewing angles are also excellent, with limited brightness drop-off when viewed off-centre.. I was also impressed with the reserved auto brightness adjustment. Too many of the phones I’ve tested have had very aggressive automatic adjustment settings that kick in even when ambient light levels haven’t changed. Brightness on the OnePlus 3T is also more than adequate for outdoor use.. One of the chief complaints when the OnePlus 3 launched was its unflattering and unnatural colour calibration. This was something that eventually got fixed through software updates, which is at least a testament to OnePlus listening to its customers.. Luckily, some of these learnings have been applied to the OnePlus 3T. Out of the box colours are a little oversaturated but the display looks great and in truth, this is how I left the display during most of my testing.. If you want more natural, representative colours, an sRGB calibration profile is also an option, which makes the colours look considerably more muted. Another custom option lets you manually adjust the colour temperature to your liking.. From the Quick Toggle menu you can also turn on a Night mode, which knocks down the blue light part of the colour spectrum. This makes the display a little less harsh on your eyes in the dark as well as supposedly reducing the impact on your circadian rhythm.. Like the Moto Z, there’s also an Ambient Display that turns the display on in a low-power mode when notifications come in, as well as Proximity Wake that turns on the display when you wave your hand over the camera. The latter doesn’t work as well as the Moto Z’s dedicated proximity sensors, however.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network. 
The iterative march can make it tough to know when to upgrade.. The average OnePlus phone owner likely upgrades faster than owners of other brands, but even they have limits. Most won't drop the money to get a new phone every six months ... but jumping up every year is totally reasonable. With the release of the OnePlus 5T there are a whole lot of OnePlus 3T owners eyeballing this upgrade who understandably passed on the quick jump to the original OnePlus 5 while their own purchase was still nice and fresh. And there are probably many OnePlus 3 owners feeling the same way, not wanting to wait another half a year for whatever succeeds it.. Whether you're hanging onto a OnePlus 3 or the slightly upgraded 3T, we want to give you the information you need to know if the OnePlus 5T is a worthy upgrade at $499.. OnePlus has held a pretty amazing consistency in its flagships from the original OnePlus One up to today's 5T. Though the exterior of the OnePlus 5T looks quite different from the 3 or 3T, the core experience of using the phone hasn't changed all that much. Android 7.1 Nougat on the OnePlus 3 and 3T is near-identical to what ships on the 5T, and all three phones are slated for the Android 8.0 Oreo update by the end of 2017.. The core experience of using the phone hasn't changed much from the OnePlus 3 to the 5T.. Performance, too, is extremely consistent between the phones. Though the OnePlus 3 may seem "old" to phone nerds, its Snapdragon 820 processor and 6GB of RAM are more than capable of pushing this nimble OxygenOS software and all of the latest apps at nearly the same pace as a Snapdragon 835 and (potentially) 8GB of RAM on the latest OnePlus 5T.. Beyond the software being displayed on the screen, the core hardware experience hasn't changed much either. We'll talk about the design changes below, but when you think about the basic hardware features — like ports, buttons, speaker, radios, etc. — you'll find few discrepancies between the previous generation and the latest. Again, it's worth remembering that even the OnePlus 3 isn't particularly old at this point, and when it was released it had most of the latest and greatest internals — they've aged well.. The most obvious difference with this upgrade is the change of hardware design. OnePlus is using the same simple, solid and efficient hardware in the 5T as it did back with the 3, but it's much more sleek and refined in 2017. The OnePlus 5T has a bit more character, more polish and more style when set next to the generic-looking OnePlus 3. The feel isn't much different between the two, but looks are important.. There's no doubt the OnePlus 5T feels like a far more 'modern' phone.. The same goes with the view from the front, where the 6-inch 2:1 display on the OnePlus 5T just feels more modern compared to the larger bezels surrounding a 5.5-inch 16:9 display on the older phones. And it isn't just for looks: you get the benefit of more usable screen space in effectively the same package, too, and the fingerprint sensor is just as usable on the back of the phone. The Optic AMOLED display panel itself isn't notably improved from last year, but getting more of it in the same basic package is a win-win.. We've established that the OnePlus 5T doesn't necessarily have a huge lead in terms of performance today compared to the older phones, but its newer specs certainly give it a longer runway into the future. The Snapdragon 820 holds up just fine today, but how about in another year? It won't feel the same as the 5T's Snapdragon 835. And that brings up a larger point about the future of software on these phones: the OnePlus 3 and 3T are likely done with official software support following the Oreo update, while the 5T will see at least the "P" release in 2018.. The 5T's specs aren't game-changing today, but they will help a ton going forward.. The one clear point of differentiation in terms of specs and their actual effect on your daily use right off the bat will be when talking about battery. The OnePlus 3's 3000mAh capacity is of course 10% smaller than the 5T's 3300mAh, but the newer phone also has a much more efficient processor on board to make better use of it. That's a real-world improvement you'll see in battery life day after day. Now when talking about the OnePlus 3T with its 3400mAh capacity, you won't see much of a difference — you can't argue with that extra capacity.. The camera comparison between these phones is a bit of a mixed bag as well. You can quite easily argue that the OnePlus 5T's newer sensor, secondary lens for low light and Portrait Mode as a complete package is better overall than the single 16MP camera on the OnePlus 3 and 3T. But in many shooting conditions that old camera — with its optical image stabilization — is going to do an admirable job that'll compare favorably to the OnePlus 5T. Yes the newer phone has more features, but in terms of raw shot-to-shot photo quality OnePlus just hasn't made massive strides in the last year.. As you can see, OnePlus hasn't made huge improvements in features or performance when comparing the OnePlus 5T to even the original OnePlus 3. But that really is more of a testament to how well the OnePlus 3 has held up over time than the OnePlus 5T being unattractive on its own. OnePlus takes a relatively conservative approach, and isn't particularly willing to throw out features or specs with the new phone — it instead refines in some areas and adds in others to give you a better phone with each generation.. This isn't a 'sure thing' sort of upgrade, but you can find reason for it — and it may not be expensive.. When you look at things this way, it's easy to say that your can be happy with your OnePlus 3T or even OnePlus 3 at the end of 2017, choosing to not drop the extra money on a new OnePlus 5T that isn't a substantial upgrade. Yes the hardware is nicer, the screen is larger and the specs give you more runway for the future; but today you'll get almost the same experience using a OnePlus 3 as you do on the OnePlus 5T.. The one thing making this upgrade decision interesting is how well OnePlus phones seem to hold their value on the used market. Browsing OnePlus listings on popular trade site Swappa shows OnePlus 3s still selling for over $200, and 3Ts often snagging upwards of $300. That's a solid return on a phone that's at least a year old, and gets you about half way toward your new OnePlus 5T, should you decide to upgrade.. If you're willing to sell on your OnePlus 3 or 3T, you can hop onto the latest and greatest from the company for what comes out to a modest investment. And in doing so, you're getting a phone with a longer runway into the future and the same great day-to-day OnePlus experience you already know and love..

CNET también está disponible en español.. OnePlus is releasing a better phone, 5 months after the OnePlus 3. The OnePlus 3T boasts a bigger battery, a faster processor and a better camera than its predecessor.. by November 15, 2016 10:30 AM PST. OnePlus 3 flaunts its luxe gold looks. Software tweaks (for everybody) OnePlus 3T Spec Comparison. In a somewhat odd move, Chinese phone maker OnePlus is releasing a high-end handset called the OnePlus 3T -- just five months after launching its OnePlus 3 flagship in June.. The OnePlus 3T (above) looks similar to the 3.. Though the device looks the same (save for a darker coat of paint called "gunmetal"), it's packed with a bigger battery, a faster processor and a better camera. It also costs a bit more: the 64GB variant is $439, £399 and a new 128GB storage option is $479, £439. (Australia pricing is currently unknown, but that converts to about AU$580 and AU$630.) A gold finish will be available later too, but only for the 64GB model.. The 3T is seen as an "evolution of the 3," according to the company's head of marketing Kyle Kiang, and OnePlus did not want to "withhold some of the improvements" it could make for a whole year, when the next flagship is expected to launch. Kiang also said that the software updates in the 3T (more on that later), will roll out to 3 owners as well.. For OnePlus 3 owners though, this still has to sting. The 3 remains a great device and you're not "stuck" with a lemon ( in fact, we gave the phone an Editors' Choice ). But buying a great phone only to learn that the same company is selling an even better version for $40 more isn't a great feeling.. The OnePlus 3T will be available in the US starting November 22, and will roll out to Europe on the 28th. The 3T will be OnePlus' marquee handset, and the company will discontinue selling the 3 after the 3T's launch. To see how these phone's differ, read on for more info.. OnePlus 3 flaunts its premium design to the masses (pictures). Compared to the OnePlus 3, the 3T has both a higher battery capacity and a faster processor. Its battery is still physically the same size, and it will still employ OnePlus' fast Dash Charging technology, but it will go from 3,000mAh to 3,400mAh. During our lab tests for continuous video playback on Airplane mode, the OnePlus 3 lasted 14 hours and 17 minutes, so we expect the 3T to last longer than that.. Likewise, the 3 had a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 820 processor. This time around, the 3T has a 2.35GHz Snapdragon 821 chipset. The 821 is the same processor you see in the Google Pixels and the LeEco LePro 3 , and OnePlus 3 claims that despite the higher clock speed, the processor will run with the same power efficiency and won't take a huge hit on battery life.. The phone's front-facing shooter jumps from 8 to 16 megapixels, and OnePlus claims it can take better low-light photos than its predecessor. The rear will remain a 16-megapixel camera, but its lens is made of a sturdier glass. Its image stabilization algorithm has also been updated so videos will appear more stable.. The OnePlus 3's (above) front-facing shooter will go from an 8- to a 16-megapixel camera.. Like the OnePlus 3, the 3T will launch with Android 6.0 Marshmallow. OnePlus does promise that a 7.0 Nougat update is in the near future for both the 3 and 3T, and that the software updates featured in the 3T will roll out to the 3 as well. That's one bit of good news for 3 owners, at least.. The software updates include more system gestures (like flipping the device upside down to mute a call and taking screenshots by sliding three fingers downward), resizable icons and a more user-friendly file manager. The shelf home screen page, which gives you fast access to your favorite contacts and email, will also get a minor facelift. You'll be able to assign passwords for individual apps for extra security too. Extended screenshots, which allows users to take screenshots beyond what appears on the display (think webpages or files that you need to scroll down and see) will also be available in a future update.. 2.15GHz + 1.6GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821. Notifications toggle, dual-SIM, Dash Charging. Notifications toggle, dual-SIM, Dash Charging. Access to LeEco's streaming platform with Live button.

Antonio Villas-Boas , Business Insider US. The OnePlus 3T is physically identical to the OnePlus 3 in every single way, which means it’s still one of the best looking phones you can buy. The OnePlus 3 (left) vs the OnePlus 3T (right). The new “gunmetal” color replaces the lighter “graphite” option. The OnePlus 3 (left) vs the OnePlus 3T (right). It looks better than the Google Pixel (in my opinion). The sapphire glass protecting the camera was also upgraded to better resist crack and scratches. The OnePlus 3T has an updated processor, which helps open and run apps slightly faster than the OnePlus 3. The front camera was also upgraded from eight megapixels on the OnePlus 3 to 16 on the 3T, but I was surprised to find the OnePlus 3 actually took sharper selfies. OnePlus 3 (left) vs OnePlus 3T (right). OnePlus claims the OnePlus 3T’s front camera takes better photos in low-light situations. That’s true — the 3T’s selfie is less grainy — but the 3’s selfie is still sharper. Selfies taken at the exact same time with the OnePlus 3 (left) and OnePlus 3T (right). OnePlus also updated the back camera to record smoother videos, but the difference is slight, and the Pixel still records smoother videos with less stutters. Otherwise, the OnePlus 3T’s rear camera is the same as the OnePlus 3, which means it’s OK, but not quite up to snuff with other top Android smartphones. Here’s the same photo taken with the Google Pixel, which looks dramatically better. Should you upgrade to the OnePlus 3T if you have the OnePlus 3, which was released just five months ago?. OnePlus released the OnePlus 3T just five months after it launched its predecessor, the OnePlus 3, so it could keep offering the latest and greatest specs.. As a result, the OnePlus 3T is priced at $450 – that’s $50 more than the OnePlus’ $400 price tag, but still considerably less than other top Android smartphones like Samsung’s Galaxy phones or Google’s new Pixel.. While the upgrades make the OnePlus 3T a better phone than the 3 overall, it didn’t necessarily shine in every single area.. See how the OnePlus 3T stacks up against the OnePlus 3, as well as the other top Android phones.. Having tougher glass protecting the camera is always going to be a good thing, even if it wasn’t a problem on the OnePlus 3.. I wasn’t expecting much of a difference between the OnePlus 3 and 3T’s performance despite the 3T’s superior processor, but I was surprised to find that apps opened with more immediacy after tapping them on the OnePlus 3T than they did on the OnePlus 3.. The OnePlus 3T’s battery is also slightly larger, but it didn’t make a perceivable difference in overall life.. I would rather OnePlus improved the rear camera than the front camera, as it’s decidedly more important unless you’re an avid selfie taker.. The OnePlus 3T’s processor and battery improvements are the only upgrades worth considering, and they’re not substantial enough to warrant an upgrade from the OnePlus 3.. If my Android phone was starting to show its age with slowing performance and I was on the market for a new phone, it would be a tough race between the OnePlus 3T and the Google Pixel.. The OnePlus 3T looks better, and it’s $450 price tag is more tempting than the Pixel’s $650 base price.. I’m also a great fan of OnePlus’ signature alert slider, which you can set to silent, ring, and “do not disturb.” You won’t find that on any other Android phone.. Software-wise, OnePlus rightfully chose to keep the pure Android aesthetic with its own Oxygen OS skin, which is generally better than the skins that Samsung, LG, and HTC have on their phones. Yet, the OnePlus 3T still won’t get updates as quickly as Google’s Pixel. In fact, the OnePlus 3T ships with Android 6.0 while the Google Pixel (and the LG V20 ) ships with Android 7.0.. At the end of the day, I’d go for the Pixel for the timely updates directly from Google, as well as its superior camera.. TAGS Features Google Pixel OnePlus OnePlus 3 OnePlus 3T Reviews Smartphones.

By dev646@gmail.com | 20 Apr 2017. this phone is really good and lives upto your expectations... i bought this phone on 14th april 2017 ... after one week of usage and system update, this phone still amazes me ... grt camera (i shot my sisters dance performance in this, grt clarity but 10min of video was 1.5 GB !, it comes with the clarity)... the best part is fastest charging ever experienced! (0 to 100% in 1hr 5 mins !)... and give me 14 hrs of backup with 4G on all the time ... take care to switch off background net using apps like facebook etc.. movies are too good to watch ... take care only charge using the official dash charger coming with this phone, the charger takes up most of the heat without transfering it to the phone ... still a slight heat does come up while it's getting juiced up... the speaker i've exprncd some less power than other phones, may be due to only one sided 6 drilled holes, but one would not mind that much... blv me it's still loud only.... the fingerprint sensor is really good , one of the fastest .. faster than my frnd's iphone 7 !. dfntly buy a protective case, the phone feels very premium and you don't want to have it scrtched ....

Although I am against Chinese products but I could not found better mobile than this at this price range.. 6GB RAM: does not deliver what it should actually do.. 64GB internal space: more than enough for moderate users. 16MP Camera (front and back) : primary camera is awesome but the problem is secondary camera (front camera) is of no use in low light or in dark as there is no flash neither enough screen light for selfie.. Battery backup: initially I had very good battery back up but as days pass it reduced and now i charge twice a day to support me for gaming / browsing / calling.. Overall: 2star for such a bad experience. Was this review helpful? Yes No. Awesome Feautures But failed to give battery backup. By Manikumar Gupta | 22 Jan 2017. I got this phone on 21st Jan 2017. And started using immediately when i receive. Please find the below details for my review. Awesome Clarity on Camera on both Front and Rear. Dash Charging technology is appreciated which will charge the mobile within 1 or 1.5 hrs. Mobile is getting heated up very quickly even thought you are not using Internet and while charging also. Im getting just 4 to 4.5 hrs after full charge.. You feel bit delicate while handling the phone. Rear Camera is projected outside the mobile which is critical to handle. Was this review helpful?

Lots of RAM (6 GB RAM). Lacks microSD slot for storage expansion. The OnePlus 3T comes as an upgraded variant of the highly acclaimed OnePlus 3. As such, it brings more than just a new Gunmetal color option. The 3T is packed with a 13% larger battery, a slightly faster processor, a higher-resolution front-facing camera, a 128GB storage variant, and 6GB of RAM as standard. While the main camera remains largely unchanged, it now has a sapphire glass cover and improved video recording capabilities. As expected, the OnePlus 3T runs the Android-based OxygenOS interface, which builds on top of stock Android by adding features like Night Mode and UI theme support.

OnePlus 3T review: A satisfying update to a fairly new phone. The epic battery life alone is a marked improvement.. Remember the OnePlus 3? It came out barely six months ago and was the best phone you could get for $400. Well, it's about to be replaced by a faster, slightly more expensive version of itself that the company is calling the OnePlus 3T. (The T doesn't stand for anything; it's a cheeky take on the typical "S" suffix denoting many flagship sequels.) The new $439 device uses the latest Snapdragon 821 processor to achieve even faster speeds, and packs a beefier battery and sharper front camera -- improvements in areas where the original sort of fell short. I say "sort of" because other than battery life, the OnePlus 3 didn't need much improving. But OnePlus made it better anyway, and now it's one of the best phones on the market, especially at this price.. Front camera performs well in low light. Only compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile. Dash charger doesn’t work with all cables. Just months after the OnePlus 3 came out, it’s being replaced with an updated model that offers better performance. For starters, the OnePlus 3T is one of the fastest phones on the market, thanks to its zippy new Snapdragon 821 processor. And now, post-update, it’s also one of the longest-lasting. Additionally, the phone’s new 16-megapixel front camera takes great portraits in low light. You still won’t find a microSD slot for expandable storage, and the lower price here means you’ll have to settle for a full HD display instead of a quad HD panel. Still, for $440 the OnePlus 3T delivers excellent value.. There isn't much of a difference, at least externally, between the OnePlus 3T and its predecessor. Indeed, a lot of what I'm going to describe here was covered in greater detail in our review of the original. The most obvious physical change is the new "gunmetal" color, which is a slightly darker shade of gray-silver than the OnePlus 3. A "soft gold" option is also available, just like with the original.. Color aside, the 3T looks exactly the same as its predecessor, which itself is impressive, given that it has a larger battery. It sports the same 5.5-inch full HD Optic AMOLED display, which was sharp and bright enough to watch videos on indoors and outdoors. It also has the same single speaker at the bottom that was loud enough to fill my living room with sound, although it got tinny at top volume.. Gallery: OnePlus 3T review | 12 Photos. You'll find the same fingerprint sensor, USB-C charging port and physical mute switch here as on the OnePlus 3. Just like the previous version, the OnePlus 3T has a dual nano SIM card slot, but no room for a microSD reader. Those who want more storage will have to opt for a new 128GB option, which costs $479. Neither phone meets widely accepted water-resistance standards, though the company says the handsets will survive wet weather. It didn't rain during my review period, so I unfortunately wasn't able to test that claim.. Gallery: OnePlus 3T OxygenOS screenshots | 12 Photos. You probably won't notice many differences between the OnePlus 3's version of OxygenOS and its successor's; the changes here are very subtle. The company resized its app icons so they're consistent across the home, all apps and Shelf pages, and added some new gestures, such as three-finger screenshots and flip-to-mute, to make the phone more convenient to use.. The OnePlus 3T also gets new apps for weather and voice recording, and allows you to lock specific apps with your fingerprint. It also features a quick-settings panel that's more similar to what you'll find on Android Nougat. The changes here aren't major, but they do make getting around the system slightly easier.. I don't generally need an excuse to go on a selfie-taking binge, but I did appreciate having "testing the OnePlus 3T's 16-megapixel front camera" as a reason to do so. The new setup is much sharper than the one on the OnePlus 3, which the company says makes for better low-light performance.. This was indeed true when I casually snapped dozens of portraits while traipsing around Manhattan one night, and the camera delivered several crisp images, despite all the motion. Not only were they sharp, but the pictures were also bright and relatively noise-free. I had to take a picture in a dark, poorly lit warehouse before I started to see any graininess. The one thing I wish the OnePlus 3T's front camera had was some form of flash, for taking clear shots in near-darkness.. Gallery: OnePlus 3T camera samples | 20 Photos.

Just because they have the same megapixel count, though, doesn't mean that the front and rear cameras are the same. They differ quite vastly on color quality, thanks to their different sensors and pixel size. The same scenes shot with the front camera looked washed-out and pale compared with those taken with the rear camera, which generally captured vibrant, richly colored images. OnePlus 3T also added a layer of sapphire glass to the back camera to protect it from scratches that could forever mar your shots.. As we mentioned in our review of the OnePlus 3, the rear camera is capable in most lighting conditions, but won't impress the way the iPhone 7 Plus or many other smartphone cameras would. It delivered sharp, accurately colored exterior shots on sunny days, and rendered a respectable amount of detail in low light, but images looked flat indoors. Still, it's perfectly adequate, and that front camera will please selfie fans like myself.. Most flagship phones released this year use the Snapdragon 820 processor , rather than the newer 821 chip that Qualcomm started offering later in the year. So, only the Google Pixel and LeEco Le Pro3 have it, which makes the OnePlus 3 slightly less competitive on specs (the LePro 3 costs the same as the OnePlus 3). I imagine this is one of the biggest reasons OnePlus decided to drop a new flagship so soon after unveiling its previous one, but still, it's a smart move.. The Snapdragon 821 processor makes the OnePlus 3T faster than the original, which was already pretty speedy. It's hard to tell the difference in day-to-day performance, because I'm not a robot and can't detect minute differences in app-launch times, but overall the 3T was very responsive. Its Vellamo score of 6,144 beat the OnePlus 3, the Samsung Galaxy S7 , the HTC 10 and the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, while its AndEBench result trumped the OnePlus 3 and the Galaxy S7 but fell short of the Pixel phones and HTC 10. The OnePlus 3T also bested the field in graphics-performance tests.. This means you're mostly going to see similar speeds across these phones. Considering the Pixels use the same chip (albeit with less RAM) but cost hundreds of dollars more, the OnePlus 3T really delivers on value here.. The OnePlus 3T has the same 6GB of RAM as the original, which makes for swift multitasking. OnePlus says it also improved the launch speed for large apps and games, so you won't have to wait quite as long to open these programs. I also found call quality to be perfectly adequate. I called a friend who was in Queens (on T-Mobile's network), and he was able to accurately repeat a string of numbers that I recited, despite his dog barking in the background, which I heard as well. Unfortunately, as with previous OnePlus handsets, the 3T works only on GSM carriers such as AT&T and T-Mobile.. One area where the company says it received the most negative feedback about the OnePlus 3 was battery life. In addition to simply bumping up the battery capacity to 3,400mAh from 3,000mAh, OnePlus tuned the power efficiency of the CPU so that despite its faster speed, it sips power at the same rate as the previous handset.. I was expecting a slight increment on endurance and wasn't quite prepared for the 3T's epic stamina. It lasted 16 hours and seven minutes on Engadget's battery test, which involves looping an HD video with the screen set to 50 percent brightness until the device conks out. That's almost six hours more than the OnePlus 3's runtime, and two hours longer than the Google Pixel XL, which has a 3,450mAh bank.. When the phone does eventually run out of juice, it charges back up to offer what the company says is a day's worth of power in 30 minutes. After the OnePlus 3T finally died on Engadget's battery test, I plugged it in and was able to take it on a quick video shoot just 15 minutes after, because it already got back up to 20 percent in that time. Not only is this fast, but that's enough juice to last at least two hours.. The OnePlus 3T faces direct competition from the LeEco Le Pro3, which uses the same processor with less RAM for $400. But the Le Pro3 suffers from unintuitive software, has a less vibrant display and doesn't last as long as the 3T.. Google's Pixel phones also use the same processors, offering similar (if not better) performance in a premium frame. These handsets have better cameras and run the latest version of Android (7.0 Nougat) , offering a cleaner interface and helpful new features like Google Assistant. But the Pixel lineup starts at $800, which is nearly twice the OnePlus 3T's asking price. Indeed, the latest OnePlus handset is probably the best handset you're going to find for around $440.. The OnePlus 3T improves things about the original that were slightly lacking, such as battery life, and amps up on performance and software, making it a strong option for power users. I particularly love the sharper front camera for its solid performance in low light. I'd also argue that the boost in endurance alone is worth the $39 price hike, but the previous iteration offered enough stamina for the average user who may not want to shell out for a few extra hours of juice. As a replacement for an existing flagship, the OnePlus 3T is a refinement that not only feels timely, but also well-planned and executed. You'd have a hard time finding a better phone for the price.. android , gadgetry , gadgets , gear , mobile , oneplus , oneplus3t , OxygenOS , review , reviews , smartphone , smartphones , Snapdragon821 , uk-reviews , video.

The OnePlus 3T is hands down the best high-performance Android phone you can buy on a budget.. The OnePlus 3T is hands down the best high-performance Android phone you can buy on a budget.. Blazing speed from Snapdragon 821 chip. Smooth Android experience with regular updates. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. The OnePlus 3T is a relatively light, internal-only revision of the impressive OnePlus 3. It brings the phone right up to date, putting it head-to-head with the Google Pixel .. A Google Pixel will cost you $650, but the OnePlus 3T is $440. That’s a massive savings, and although OnePlus bumped the price of the 3T up by $40 over the OnePlus 3’s $400 price tag, it’s still way cheaper than the Galaxy S8 , the LG G6 , or any other big-brand flagship Android phone on sale today. The insanely low price is low enough to make you wonder:. The OnePlus 3 was the best phone OnePlus had made, and one we highly recommended. Can a revision that adds newer hardware to a winning package do anything other than improve on the original? We’ve been finding out, and have revisited the OnePlus 3T on release of the midnight black model.. Put the OnePlus 3 next to the OnePlus 3T and unless you are familiar with the colors — the OnePlus 3T ditches silver for a stylish gunmetal finish, and also comes in a stunning, limited edition black finish — it’s absolutely impossible to tell them apart. There was no sense in changing the OnePlus 3’s design after just six months, because it was solid to start with.. The OnePlus 3T replaces the sandpaper-like body of the old OnePlus 2 for smooth metal, with a sleek, minimal design. There’s a solitary OnePlus logo stamped on the back, bookended by iPhone and HTC-like antenna breaks, and a slightly raised camera lens. Pick it up, and the sides are subtly curved and completely smooth. It fits in your palm extremely well. We hold our phones many times during the day, and comfort is very important. However, since the OnePlus 3 made its debut, in-hand comfort has been taken to the next level by phones such as the ZTE Axon 7. The OnePlus 3T can’t quite match the thought and effort that went into shaping the Axon 7’s body in particular. It’s not like it’s covered in thorns, but the game has definitely moved on from the somewhat sharp edges of the 3T. If you swooned at the sight of the OnePlus 3, then the 3T will make you weak at the knees, too.. The OnePlus 3T is very compact, with a body that’s very slim and weighs just 158 grams. The bezels around the screen are slim, but it doesn’t have the bezel-less display that’s now a feature on premium phones like the Galaxy S8 and LG G6. Choose the midnight black model, and the dark colors do a great job of disguising the size of the phone in general, and because the antenna lines are also black, the rear of the device is even more minimally styled.. If you swooned at the sight of the OnePlus 3, then the 3T will make you weak at the knees, too.. A pane of curved 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4 covers the screen, completing the slick modern design. It’s punctuated only by the fingerprint sensor, which doubles as the home button. On the side of the body, the notification alert slider makes a welcome return. The two-stage switch lets you selectively mute alerts, based on importance. It’s a time-saver, and the switch itself has a cool knurled pattern for grip. Its placement at the top left of the device is a little odd, but only if you’re right handed.. The fingerprint sensor always recognized my print with astonishing speed, and there’s NFC in the OnePlus 3T, so the phone supports Android Pay. Mobile payments are hit or miss, but Android Pay’s problems are hardly unique to the 3T.. The OnePlus 3T has a 5.5-inch Optic AMOLED screen with a 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution. What’s Optic AMOLED? According to OnePlus CEO Carl Pei, the Samsung-supplied screens feature a dual-polarizing layer that’s tuned for improved color temperature and contrast. On the OnePlus 3, it was always a pain to “tune” using the basic controls, but that’s changed on the OnePlus 3T. Out of the box, it looks amazing, and the true whites really shine through in a way that was difficult to achieve on the 3. If it’s too stark, under a Screen Calibration setting, there’s an eye-pleasing sRGB option, and a custom setting with a warm-to-cool slider.. Don’t for one second think the 1080p resolution holds the OnePlus 3T back. It’s stunning, and further proof a 2,560 x 1,440 pixel resolution isn’t really essential on a smartphone of this size. If there is one slight downside, it’s the outdoor performance in sunlight. The screen is highly reflective, and the brightness never elevates itself to a high enough level for super visibility.. The primary change between the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T is the replacement of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 with the newer and more powerful Snapdragon 821 processor. Yes it has since been superseded by Qualcomm with the Snapdragon 835, but that’s only available in a handful of very expensive phones at the moment. The RAM remains the same at 6GB, and although there are a few other alterations, the chip swap is undoubtedly the main reason why the 3T is more expensive. Therefore, you’ll want to see a noticeable performance bump, right?. It’s difficult to tell the difference. It’s not like the OnePlus 3 performed like it was wading through six feet of sludge. Putting the two alongside each other and seeing if there was any visible difference seemed like a good place to start. A few searches in Chrome, scrolling through lists on Twitter, and playing side-by-side games revealed … no discernible difference whatsoever.. This is simply one of the highest performing smartphones you can buy.. Putting the OnePlus 3T up against the OnePlus 3 this way is perhaps the easiest way to find any differences. AnTuTu 3D on the OnePlus 3 scores 144,131, and the same test on the OnePlus 3T comes back with 166,912. Both were run in the same environment, with no other apps running, and on the most up-to-date public release version of OxygenOS.. That’s a big difference, and not only does it crush just about every other phone out there, but the spankings continued through other tests as well. Geekbench 4 returned 4,133 multi-core on the OnePlus 3 and 4,390 multi-core on the OnePlus 3T. We ran 3DMark’s Slingshot ES3.1 gaming benchmarking test on both, too. The OnePlus 3 scored 2,561, while the OnePlus 3T came back with 2,700.. However, many will be asking that if you can’t see the differences going about your day-to-day business, is there really any point? If you already own the OnePlus 3, then no, probably not. However, by selecting the 3T you’re getting a newer phone that will still keep pace with high-end phones for longer, and longevity is very important in the smartphone world. It also makes the phone even more cost-effective.. There are some other changes that won’t be instantly noticeable, either, but are definite benefits. The OnePlus 3T runs cooler when under pressure than the 3, and the increased power efficiency offered by the Snapdragon 821 means the larger capacity 3,400mAh battery will last even longer.. There wasn’t a moment when the OnePlus 3T felt like anything other than a rocket ship, and there was no point where more power would have been helpful. This is simply one of the highest performing smartphones you can buy, and one of the fastest smartphones we’ve ever tried.. The OnePlus 3T has the same 16-megapixel camera as the. It has an f/2.0 aperture, optical image stabilization, HDR, and a 1.28-inch sensor. However, OnePlus has tweaked the software. The ultra-high contrast images taken with the OnePlus 3 have been toned down ever-so slightly, so the OnePlus 3T takes pictures that are more natural, but still pleasingly vivid.. Close-up photos blur the background very nicely, and on a sunny day, blue skies shine beautifully. With HDR activated, shadowy areas lit up. In low light, plenty of detail is revealed, and although it can’t quite keep pace with the iPhone 7 Plus. or Google Pixel, you won’t be disappointed. Shots of lit buildings in the dark saw the 3T create fantastic, inky blacks, but the OIS couldn’t quite keep things steady enough to maintain detail.. Around the front, the OnePlus 3T has a 16-megapixel selfie camera. The reason for this massive sensor is not just for selfie-lovers, but for live-streamers who demand a high-definition image. It’s great, and even in low-light — when the camera combines pixels to artificially boost the light — it does well. There’s a simple beauty mode, and a feature where it’s supposed to recognize smiles and activate the shutter, but it never worked for us.. Swipe to the right to access a manual mode, where ISO, focus, shutter speed, and brightness can be adjusted. A tripod is necessary to get the best from the manual mode, but. the OnePlus 3T takes great photos without messing around with the settings. The software is fast and easy to use, but when shooting video, it oddly shows a far larger image in the viewfinder, meaning objects you think fill the frame are actually far too close.. Annoyingly, this issue still hasn’t been cured on our newly delivered, and up-to-date midnight black 3T.. Nougat in the OxygenOS 4.1.3 user interface, modifying the operating system slightly from Google’s vision. It’s not a drastic alteration, and it’s closer to how Motorola deals with Android than a more heavy UI favored by Samsung. Purists will be pleased to note the app drawer is present and the notification shade is as Google intended. Our midnight black version has the March 1 Android security patch installed, bringing it almost up to date. April and May security updates are out from Google, though, so we hope OnePlus will quickly follow through.. There are a few modifications included in OxygenOS. The most noticeable is Shelf, which slides in from the left of the home screen, where you can find shortcuts to frequently used apps, space for Android widgets, the weather, and a space to write memos. It’s easy to turn off OnePlus’ Shelf option if you don’t like it.. OnePlus installs its own gallery app, file manager app, music player, voice recorder, and a new Community app. This last one is an odd addition, but in line with OnePlus’ commitment to interacting with its loyal users. It gives direct access to the company’s busy online forums, and it’s a bit like looking at a self-diagnosis website when you’re sick. The forums have plenty of complaints and moans, most of which are isolated incidents, but it can make you go looking for problems when none really exist.. OxygenOS was unshakable and we haven’t had any stability issues, or any unwillingness to run any app we threw at it. SwiftKey’s keyboard is an option, but due to personal preference, we chose Google’s Android keyboard, which performs brilliantly, and we love the subtle haptic feedback.. Depending on which model you buy, you can get either 64GB or 128GB of internal memory, but sadly there’s no MicroSD card slot to increase your storage. OnePlus decided not to go for one of the new dual-SIM trays that have the option of using one of the slots for a memory card, so the 3T is a strictly dual-SIM device. For this reason, we suggest opting for the 128GB OnePlus 3T, especially as the phone’s performance will see it last for several years before it needs replacing.. The last major update for the OnePlus 3T is Android O , according to the head of product at OnePlus, who disclosed the information on the firm’s. The company will continue to provide security updates in the future — particularly OxygenOS v4.5 within the upcoming months.. Even though the OnePlus 3T has the same dimensions as the OnePlus 3, it contains a larger capacity 3,400mAh battery, which we found to last about a day with moderately heavy use. You can elongate battery life even further, using the battery saver, which turns off location, background data, and the vibrate feature. You know when it’s active, because the notification bar turns bright orange. One thing we do like is the chance to display the battery icon as a circle and not a bar. It’s much easier to visualise the remaining time, if you choose not to show the percentage figure.. The Dash Charge fast-charging system is back, and OnePlus claims it will charge the battery to 60 percent capacity in just 30 minutes. Our tests showed this to be accurate, and a timed run saw 60 percent arrive in 31 minutes. A full charge was completed in an hour and 20 minutes. The same as we achieved with the OnePlus 3.. The much-hated invitation system is a thing of the past, and you can buy a OnePlus 3T through OnePlus’ own online store right now. If you’re in the U.K., OnePlus has secured its first network deal, and the phone can be purchased through O2 with a two-year plan .. However, we always recommend buying a phone without a contract, if possible, and it’s definitely the way to buy the OnePlus 3T; but it’s more expensive that the OnePlus 3 It’s $440 for the 64GB model, which is $40 more than the equivalent — and now discontinued — OnePlus 3. The 128GB model is $480, and you have to choose that configuration if you want the midnight black model. In the U.K., the price has increased to 400 British pounds, up from the 330 British pounds the OnePlus 3 cost during the summer, and a whopping 80 British pounds more than the 310 British pounds it started out costing.. OnePlus has a one-year warranty on its devices in the United States, where device defects will be repaired or a replacement device will be provided for free, including the shipping and handling costs. It doesn’t cover wear and tear, or water damage. Alternatively, OnePlus offers an extended warranty plan though Assurant Solutions called On-Guard. Plans can be for a year, 18 months, or two years, and see devices repaired or replaced in the U.S., rather than China. This means the turnaround should be quicker. Costs range from $20 to $110 extra.. The OnePlus 3T has enough power to birth small galaxies, and more style than the pages of a glossy fashion magazine, yet still manages to leave hundreds of dollars in your pocket when you choose it over the competition. One or two software problems did show up — video recorder, and the smile shutter for example — but we hope these will be fixed in the near future, and they aren’t enough to put us off.. The OnePlus 3T is by far the best value smartphone on sale today, particularly in light of rising prices for flagship phones like the $720-plus Samsung Galaxy S8 and the $650-plus LG G6. The chance to save between $200 and $300 on a highly competent new smartphone simply can’t be ignored. Even though the processor is now a little dated, it’s still technically “fresh,” and the phone potentially won’t need replacing for several years to come. Yes, the OnePlus 3T will be superseded, but its current ability and performance mean you probably won’t care.. If money isn’t the main driver, then the Google Pixel is likely the only Android phone that comes close to the OnePlus 3T in terms of our own recommendation. Its camera is superb and it has Android 7.0 Nougat with Google Assistant installed; but it costs $650, and is almost always out of stock.. Fossil Q Marshal Digital Display Silicone Touchscreen Smartwatch. If you want to keep the price on your new smartphone low, the ZTE Axon 7. has been our most recommended smartphone for $400, just edging out the OnePlus 3 in many circumstances. The OnePlus 3T costs a little more, but it’s worth it. However, the OnePlus 3T now costs more than the magic $400, and if that’s all you want to spend, the Axon 7 is the choice to make. may want to investigate the Honor 8 Pro , which combines a great camera with good software and other strong features, for 480 British pounds.. However, all this applies to someone wanting to buy a new smartphone right this minute. The OnePlus 3T is nearly six months into its lifespan, and rumors are flying about a sequel in the near future. If you buy one, be prepared to see it replaced before the end of the summer.. The OnePlus 3T isn’t a rugged phone, and misses out on any water resistance , so you’ll have to be careful with it if you want it to last. It should be worth it, though, because the processor is still one of the fastest out there, which enables OnePlus 3T owners to keep up with. gaming and app trends, ensuring their phone will handle the best software for some time to come.. Our midnight black OnePlus 3T has Android 7.1.1 Nougat installed with the March 1 Android Security Patch, so it’s nearly. OnePlus has shaken up its software department recently , and promised more timely software updates in the future.. The updates come to an end with Android O, but the device will continue to receive security updates.. The OnePlus 3T is a ridiculously good value smartphone, without any of the drawbacks you’d expect from anything labeled as “good value.” It’s beautiful to look at, great to use, takes impressive pictures, and is technically capable enough to give years of service. All for $440? Just buy one.. Update: Android O will be the last major update for OnePlus 3 and 3T. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

OnePlus 3T review: Rekindling a love story. The best budget-minded flagship gets even better with a mid-cycle spec bump.. The OnePlus 3 is easily the company's most complete (and well-received) product, offering a high-end experience at a fraction of what you'd expect to pay elsewhere. But the hardcore phone nerds that are so often potential OnePlus buyers are a fickle bunch, and they may not be interested in buying an "old" phone that was released six months ago. The answer? Bump the specs, add a couple important improvements and re-release the phone to reassure potential buyers that they're getting the absolute best when they buy.. The result of that thinking is the OnePlus 3T. The "T" doesn't really mean anything, per se, aside from the fact that some companies use an "S" to denote their follow-up models ... and well, T is one letter more. But the name also denotes that you're getting the new phone, and the OnePlus 3T does have a few points of distinction that are worth re-evaluating it as a phone worthy of your hard-earned dollars.. With the same great overall experience so many people enjoyed on the original OnePlus 3, the OnePlus 3T adds a little extra in the form of some new specs, a new storage option, a fresh color choice and the promise that a new software version is just a month away. Here is our full review of the mid-cycle OnePlus refresh.. I (Andrew Martonik) am writing this review after 9 days using a gunmetal OnePlus 3T with 128GB of storage. The entirety of the review was conducted on the T-Mobile network in the greater Seattle, WA area. The phone's software arrived on version 28_161027 (with the October 1 security patch), and was not updated during the course of review. The phone was provided to Android Central for review by OnePlus.. The external hardware design of the OnePlus 3T is identical to that of the original OnePlus 3, so I won't get into the minutiae of the hardware details yet again. I will point out, though, that even six months on, the design and in-hand feel still hold up. The aluminum feels great, the build quality is precise and I still love the Alert Slider for quickly silencing the phone. Up front the 1080p display (which remains unchanged) is still colorful and crisp, but its overall brightness leaves just a little bit to be desired — its aggressive dropping of brightness when set to "auto" doesn't help, either.. The hardware absolutely still holds up, and outdoes other phones in its class.. For a 5.5-inch phone the OnePlus 3T is still plenty thin and compact, though the slick metal body doesn't quite offer enough grip for me sometimes. I found myself putting it in a OnePlus sandstone case more often than not, which is a shame because I really love this new gunmetal color that's a bit deeper and includes a hint of brown when compared to the old silver color. If you want something a bit different, the soft gold metal with a white front remains an option, and will be on sale shortly after launch.. Now to what OnePlus actually changed. There's a faster processor, a larger battery, a new front-facing camera (more on that below) and a sapphire covering for the rear camera. You can also now option up to 128GB of internal storage for a very fair $40 more, which will help placate those still miffed by the lack of SD card slot.. The internal hardware additions are nice, and mean that you can rest assured that you have the latest and greatest inside, but right now the specs really just make sure that your OnePlus 3T will be good to use in another year more so than improving things dramatically today.. OnePlus 3T Software and performance. It's a tad superfluous to spend all that much time talking about the software here, as by the time the first OnePlus 3T orders arrive they'll be less than a month away from an OTA that will bring Android 7.0 Nougat. I absolutely have to say that perhaps holding off on the launch of the OnePlus 3T in order to ship it with Nougat out of the box would have been a real treat, but I also understand the desire to get the phone out in the market for the holiday season as well.. Nougat will be here soon, but for now the OxygenOS Marshmallow experience is excellent.. But as it stands, the OnePlus 3T will greet you with roughly the same "OxygenOS" experience built on Android 6.0 Marshmallow as you'll find on the OnePlus 3, OnePlus 2 and OnePlus X today. The newly combined OnePlus software team has made a handful of small visual and feature enhancements, though — there's a fresh look to the notification shade, a few tweaks to the stock launcher and under-the-hood file system improvements to provide even more speed.. The tweaks are relatively minor, and all build into the same great software vision — OxygenOS is still all about simplicity, respecting Google's vision for Android and augmenting it with a handful of useful features and customization options. As I've said before, OxygenOS includes many of the features we rooted our phones for years to get, and it integrates them into Android as if they were meant to be.. Though the OnePlus 3 was already one of the best-performing and slickest phones available, a bump to a newer Snapdragon 821 processor is always welcome. The OnePlus 3T is of course extremely fast and smooth, and I never experienced a slowdown in over a week of using it — and I'd expect it to hold up just as well as my OnePlus 3 has after months of use. And not only does the new Snapdragon 821 give you the confidence that you're getting the latest and greatest mobile CPU when you buy the phone, but it also prepares you for the future — you just got a little extra runway for top-end performance a year or 18 months from now.. It isn't uncommon to finish a day with over half of the battery left.. The same goes for the battery, which jumped over 10% in capacity to a hearty 3400 mAh. Together with the more efficient processor and already svelte software, the OnePlus 3T has offered me amazing battery life. My usual day, kicking off at 8 a.m., with lots of podcast listening, frequent app use, retrieving email, managing my social networking apps and taking photos left me with 40-50% battery when I headed to bed after 10 p.m. A lighter weekend day saw the OnePlus 3T end up with over 65% left when I went to bed. That longevity puts it in rare company already, and battery life is only set to get better when Nougat arrives.. Dash Charge fast charging is of course still included, though because battery life was so great I really didn't find a need for it and regularly just used whatever charger I had laying around. Adding to that feeling is the fact that Dash Charge is proprietary to the OnePlus 3 and 3T, meaning I'm still going to lean toward carrying a different charger that's better suited to powering all of my devices rather than tailoring to just one. But for those who just use a single phone, the ridiculously fast refill times from Dash Charge still can't be overlooked.. interesting move to switch away from its previous 8MP front-facing camera, which had large 1.4-micron pixels, to a new 16MP sensor (different from the rear camera) with much smaller 1-micron pixels. Aside from the spec change the camera is still fixed-focus and offers 1080p video, if that's your sort of thing.. This feels like an overall upgrade to the front-facing camera, but it's still just average.. On the face of it (har har) this change should offer better image quality in daylight and a dropoff in low light situations. The camera does pretty well, actually, particularly in better lighting. Low light shots were understandably grainy, but no more so than any other front-facing camera I've used lately. The only issues I can find here is that the fixed focal distance can sometimes leave your face a tad soft (an issue with most front-facing cameras), and there's no sort of front-facing "flash" mode that lights up the screen in dark situations. A move to an auto focusing front-facing camera would be more expensive, but a front-facing screen light when taking a selfie in darker areas should be standard particularly when you have a sensor with such small pixels.. Now, a small gallery of selfies for you to judge (hopefully just the camera quality) for yourself — and no, these shots didn't use the "beauty" mode.. The rear camera is exceptional for a $440 phone, and competitive with $650+ phones.. Aside from the addition of a sapphire glass covering, the rear camera has remained unchanged from the OnePlus 3 — a 16MP sensor with f/2.0 lens that's known to be a solid performer. The Snapdragon 821's improved ISP (image signal processor) may be helping things a tad here, but I honestly couldn't tell the difference in images taken with the OnePlus 3T versus its predecessor. In most situations the camera does a great job of quickly snapping a photo that's accurate and colorful, though low light pictures still get a good bit of blurry chroma smoothing when compared to top performers like the Pixel XL. For a $440 phone the camera is beyond fantastic, and when compared to $650+ phones it's competitive. Once again, things could improve further with the Nougat update.. Whenever a company replaces a popular product with a new model less than six months after its launch, it has the potential to turn customers sour. Discontinuing the OnePlus 3 in favor of a spec-bumped and more expensive OnePlus 3T was always going to rub some the wrong way, but considering the overall minor extent of the upgrades and the continued software support for the original model I think we can all get past it. The original OnePlus 3 is still a great phone today, and nobody who has one should feel any different now than the 3T is here.. You still can't find a better value than the OnePlus 3T.. Looking at the OnePlus 3T as a standalone device, available in late 2016 to compete with phones ranging from $400 to $700, it's absolutely a fantastic total package. OnePlus took a proven platform that was already a crown jewel of "affordable flagship" phones, and refreshed it with a couple important improvements without removing anything that made it appealing when it launched the first time earlier this year.. Even with the modest price bump, the OnePlus 3T is an amazing value. It has great hardware, slick and responsive software, amazing battery life, strong rear camera and every internal spec you could want. Even its few weaknesses, like slightly low screen brightness, lack of waterproofing and questionable software update frequency, are minimal bad marks on what is otherwise an exceptional phone. At $439, you can't find a better value than the OnePlus 3T.. OnePlus 3T review: Rekindling a love story. Discuss OnePlus 3T and 3 in the forums. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge review: this is the smartphone to beat. iPhone 7 Plus review: 2014 called – it wants its phablet back. The OnePlus 3T is a minor update to a very good smartphone which improves on some key areas, but it isn’t quite the bargain the original was.. The Chinese smartphone firm only released the OnePlus 3 in June , but already it has been replaced. The 3T is practically identical to its predecessor, a slight colour difference on the outside the only sign that things have changed.. According to OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, the company had some improvements available that would fit more or less in the same package – a larger battery, faster processor and improved cameras – so rather than wait a year, it simply replaced the OnePlus 3 with the 3T.. But at the same time it has also increased the price of the smartphone, from its original £309 on launch, through its post Brexit referendum currency adjustment of £329 to a starting price of £399. Is the new 3T worth £70 more than the old 3?. The smooth aluminium body with a curved back and beveled sides feels every bit as good six months on with the 3T. It is a very nice smartphone to hold, touch and appreciate: there’s no doubt the 3T has the look and feel of a smartphone costing much more than £400.. The 5.5in 1080p AMOLED screen is great. Now you can customise the colour tone to your liking, although out of the box most people will be very happy with the more subtle colour mode OnePlus uses compared to other AMOLED-using phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S7.. With a pixel density of 401 pixels per inch, the 3T isn’t quite as crisp as top-end Android competitors, which have quad HD resolutions at the same screen size, and therefore side-by-side with a 534ppi Google Pixel XL it looks slightly less pin sharp. Most will be happy with it, although it will be noticeably poorer for virtual reality applications.. The narrow bezels and curved back make it manageable one-handed even with the 5.5in screen. It isn’t quite as narrow as the current king of the large screen in a tiny bodied phone, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, but it is 1mm narrower than the Pixel XL.. OnePlus’ excellent notification slider completes some well made buttons on the left and right side of the phone.. The OnePlus 3T has the same amount of memory and storage as its predecessor, but has a slightly more powerful processor: the Snapdragon 821 from Qualcomm, which is used in other high-end Android smartphones including the Pixel XL.. It feels snappy, but not quite the fastest smartphone on the market: the Huawei Mate 9. It doesn’t feel any faster than the OnePlus 3 , but the battery did last longer between charges. It has a slightly larger battery, and software refinements over the last six months have made the experience smoother.. Used as my primary device with five hours of listening to music through Bluetooth earbuds, three hours spent browsing or using apps, occasional gaming and taking photos, with hundreds of push notifications throughout the day, the OnePlus 3T lasted around 36 hours between charges.. The big improvement over the 3 has been in standby performance: where the 3 dropped 12-16% overnight , the 3T dropped only 4%, which is very good compared to most of the competition.. Charging the battery is fast, too. With OnePlus’ proprietary Dash Charge power adapter and cable it took just over 70 minutes to reach 100% from zero charge, which is right up there with the fastest charging smartphones. It can also be charged using pretty much any USB charger, but at a standard rate.. The OnePlus 3T also has dual-Sim support, which means two mobile phone contracts and two numbers can be used at the same time in the same phone. It’s a common and useful feature in Asia, but rare in the UK, and makes travelling or juggling a work and personal phone much easier within one device.. The fingerprint scanner on the front, which doubles as a home button, is excellent. It’s fast, accurate and works great.. OnePlus customises Android to create OxygenOS. Unlike some other manufacturers the changes are subtle, more refinements rather than drastic alterations.. If you’re a fan of the standard Android experience, you will appreciate OxygenOS. It has more customisation options, from the ability to swap the navigation buttons over, put them on screen or use the capacitive buttons beside the fingerprint scanner, to extended gesture support and tweaks for the dual-Sim capabilities.. But the 3T ships with OxygenOS 3.5, which is based on last year’s Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, not the newest Android 7 Nougat. OnePlus expects to have an update to Nougat available before the end of the year. So far, it has not had the best track record for speedy software updates, but has got better over the last few months.. The 16-megapixel rear camera has some subtle improvements to detail and noise suppression over the OnePlus 3. Overall it’s a capable camera, shooting detailed shots in good lighting and solid if not remarkable shots in lowlight. It’s not quite as good as the best from Samsung or Google, but it’s hard to take a rubbish shot with the 3T.. The 16-megapixel selfie camera is one of the highest resolution front-facing cameras available, and although more megapixels does not always equal better results, the 3T produced some of the most detailed and natural-looking selfies I’ve ever shot, even in tough lighting conditions such as office fluorescent strip lights.. The OnePlus 3T is available in either gun metal grey or soft gold with 64GB of storage for £399 or just in gun metal with 128GB of storage for £439. It’s also available exclusively with a mobile phone contract with O2 in the UK. For comparison, the 5.5in Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge costs £520, the Google Pixel XL costs £719, the Huawei Mate 9 costs €699 (£589) and the Apple iPhone 7 Plus costs £719.. The OnePlus 3T is an excellent smartphone. The fit and finish is right up there with the best, the metal design is refined and even with a 5.5in screen, it’s a manageable smartphone to use on a daily basis.. It isn’t quite the bargain the OnePlus 3 was , and I don’t think it’s worth £70 more than the previous model. But with currency fluctuations the way they are and the pound down against the US dollar it’s not all about profit. It is still excellent value for £400 when Apple and Google’s equivalent smartphones, that boast less storage, cost £719.. With the backing of O2, OnePlus also now has more legitimacy as a manufacturer in the UK. And while there’s certainly room for improvement, the company is committed to delivering faster software updates.. You get more than what you pay for with the OnePlus 3T compared to rivals..

Like, seriously, it's the worst phone I've ever bought, and the customer service is nonexistent. My phone stopped working right within a month, and the warrantee was already up. (It's good for two weeks.) The phone randomly dies and won't start again for days. I've never dropped it or gotten it wet. Half the apps I download don't work. But mostly, there's no one who can service it. The only way to get this stupid thing fixed is to mail it across the country to a service center, which takes 2 days each way, and then however long it takes them to process and fix it. Stick to a company that stands behind their products and can help you with problems in a timely and local manner.. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of PhoneDog.com. Would Recommend to a friend.. Posted on: April 20th, 2017 by sam. One Plus phones may be good in specs bu they are the worst phones to buy. Dont ever buy these phones the battery life after 3 months use only last 1hr and bluetooth most of the times dont work the phone shouts down randomly while using it and bluetooth earphones don't work when using with phone calls.

The OnePlus 3 (also abbreviated as OP3 ) is a smartphone produced by OnePlus. It was revealed on June 14, 2016. [1] [2] The phone was unveiled in a virtual reality event and OnePlus offered its customers Loop VR headsets to experience the event using their phones, giving away 30,000 free headsets in lieu of a traditional press conference. Prior to the global launch event, OnePlus revealed that the OnePlus 3 would have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 6 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage. [5] After criticism from customers about the removal of the NFC chip from their previous phone, OnePlus once again included NFC.. The OnePlus 3 is the first OnePlus device to not be part of the invite system, [6] which OnePlus had used for its last three devices to regulate flow with inadequate manufacturing for the inevitable high demand.. Following some controversy, the OxygenOS 3.2.1 update began rollout on 7 July 2016, with improved RAM management, an alternate sRGB display mode in developer options, and various bug fixes. An updated version of the device, called the OnePlus 3T , was announced by the company on November 15, 2016 and released on November 22. It improves upon the OnePlus 3 by including the newer Snapdragon 821 chipset, a 16MP front camera, along with a 3400mAh non-removable battery. [8] [9] Sales of the OnePlus 3 were discontinued on November 17 with the OnePlus 3T replacing it. It was also announced the phone will share the same software update cycle with its successor starting from Android N. [10] [11] After owners of the phone expressed concern whether their phone would be abandoned after the release of the. OnePlus 5 , it was confirmed by Pete Lau, the CEO, that the phone, and its predecessor would eventually receive a software update to. It was also announced that it would be the last major update. On 8 September 2017, the phone started receiving Android O in closed beta with public beta updates following soon after as part of their community beta program. [14] As of September 19, 2017, Android O is delivered via update. The OnePlus 3 features a new metal back design, similar to that of an HTC M9 or later, with anodised aluminium and curved edges. The device is available in two colors, Graphite (black/gray) and Soft Gold (white/gold, released later in August 2016. [16] ) Additionally, users can purchase protective covers in Kevlar or black apricot wood, bamboo, rosewood, and sandstone which takes care of the camera hump and evens it with the phone.. The device is slightly smaller than its predecessor, the OnePlus 2. It's 2.5mm thinner, 0.9mm shorter, and 0.2mm narrower, but still has the same screen size, at 5.5 inches (140. The display is still 1920×1080 px, comparable to that of the previous two models, but the 3 is the first flagship OnePlus to have an optic AMOLED display. As is typical for most smartphones, the OnePlus 3 features Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection. The OnePlus 3 in OnePlus' StyleSwap cover.. The OnePlus 3 is also the first OnePlus phone to ship with only 64 GB of storage available, as all other OnePlus devices have shipped with a 16 GB option also. The onboard storage is UFS 2.0, but there is no option for memory expansion via an SD card. The OnePlus 3 does include a dual-sim card tray, but fails to have compatibility with LTE band 13, [18] making LTE unavailable to Verizon customers in the United States.. For the rear-facing camera, the OnePlus 3 has a 16 MP f/2.0 Sony IMX 298 sensor, with both optical image stabilisation and electronic image stabilisation. It is capable of 4K video at 30fps, and 720p slo-mo video at 120fps. Further, it includes support for shooting RAW images, allowing greater control of the image to the user. The front camera is an 8 MP f/2.0 Sony IMX179 sensor, with 1080p at 30fps video and fixed focus. One new feature to the OnePlus 3 is Dash Charge. It is a custom version of OnePlus' parent company's ( OPPO Electronics ) VOOC Charging. The feature is made possible by the processor, which has Quick Charge 3.0 support. [20] According to the company, the battery can achieve a 60% or more charge within 30 minutes. This is accomplished by doing all the power transforming required for direct input to the battery in the power brick supplied, not within the phone itself, reducing heat on the device. Additionally, the power brick can contain larger, dedicated electronics, whereas any power processing on a phone has to use smaller and cooler equipment, reducing the speed of charging.. Other features include the alert slider, originally added to the OnePlus 2. NFC was added again from the OnePlus One (as it was absent from OnePlus 2).. A fingerprint scanner is also found at the bottom of the screen. It is estimated to unlock after approximately 0.3 seconds, becoming one of the fastest scanners on a phone. TDD 38 / 39 / 40 / 41.

(December 2016) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ). The Verge gave the OnePlus 3 an 8.6/10, praising its great build quality, high performance and sharp display. However, The Verge had some reservations about the phone, noting that it does not work on the US Verizon or Sprint networks, it does not have an SD Card slot, and the quick charging is limited to a OnePlus-specific cable and power brick. Nonetheless, they conclude that "The One Plus 3 is the rare kind of phone [we] can recommend without reservations" [31]. Mashable gave the One Plus 3 a notable mention, saying that " [the] One Plus 3 is practically the perfect Android smartphone". Wired also praised the smartphone concluding that the One Plus 3 is "A true flagship phone with style and power".. ZDNet commented that the OnePlus3 is "An excellent all-rounder with some very attractive capabilities.". On 6 August 2016, The OnePlus 3 Appeared on the No.1 spot in Stuff.tv 's Buyers Guide 2016.. The OnePlus 3 is also one of the best smartphones of 2016 by Android Police .. With the release of OnePlus 3, the company got the "Best Phone Brand" of the year from PcPro.. Marques Brownlee also praised the phone for its performance, display and camera, but criticized the camera bump found on the rear of the phone and the smaller battery compared to that of previous generations. Neither the OnePlus One nor the OnePlus 2 had a camera bump, and both featured slightly larger batteries. He also noted that OnePlus refrained from attempting to innovate, stating that it "doesn't really have any huge, big gimmicks or risks". He implicitly compares this to LG 's and Lenovo 's attempts at modularity with their recent flagships, respectively the LG G5 and the Moto Z. In summary, Brownlee felt that the phone "despite being so simple, really is the complete package". Several online reports claimed that despite the OnePlus 3's 6 GB of RAM, the phone could not handle more than 3 or 4 applications at one time. [33] Ars Technica added that OnePlus configured its build of Android to impose an artificial limit of 20 applications stored in RAM at a time. [34] OnePlus indicated this was a deliberate choice to maximize battery life. On launch, XDA Developers called the OnePlus 3 the "Perfect Canvas for the Spec-Hungry Tinkerer". [35] In January they discovered that with the launch of the Android 7.0 Nougat update, OnePlus introduced a software defeat device into the code of the OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus 3T, relaxing thermal throttling and increasing clock speeds when the phone detected that it was in a benchmark app, in order to boost benchmark scores. [36] This came as a bit of a shock to much of the Android enthusiast community, as every major manufacturer had removed their benchmark cheating code following the massive backlash that occurred when it was originally discovered on other devices in 2013. [37] [38] OnePlus immediately stated that they would be removing the benchmark cheating from future software versions, and that they weren't sure how it made it into a production build. [36] OnePlus later reversed this decision with the OnePlus 5, reintroducing the software that locked clock speeds to their maximum while in a benchmark. ^ "The OnePlus 3 will be unveiled on June 14".
