The SoC integrates different hardware components such as the CPU, GPU, memory, peripherals, interfaces, etc., as well as software for their functioning.. Information about the process technology used in manufacturing the chip. The value in nanometers represents half the distance between elements that make up the CPU.. CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors. They increase the performance of the device allowing the execution of multiple instructions in parallel.. The frequency of the processor describes its clock rate in cycles per second. It is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. GPU is a graphical processing unit, which handles computation for 2D/3D graphics applications. In mobile devices GPU is usually utilized by games, UI, video playback, etc. GPU can also perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the CPU.. The frequency is the clock rate of the graphic processor (GPU), which is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. RAM (Random-Access Memory) is used by the operating system and all installed applications. Data in the RAM is lost after the device is turned off or restarted.. Information about the type of RAM used by the device.. Information about the number of RAM channels integrated in the SoC. More channels mean higher data transfer rates.. RAM frequency relates directly to the rate of reading/writing from/in the RAM memory.. Information about the capacity of the built-in storage of the device. Sometimes one and the same model may is offered in variants with different internal storage capacity.. The various types of memory cards are characterized by different sizes and capacity. Information about the supported types of memory cards.. One of the main characteristics of the display is its type/technology, on which depends its performance.. In mobile devices display size is represented by the length of its diagonal measured in inches.. The ratio between the long and the short side of the display. The display resolution shows the number of pixels on the horizontal and vertical side of the screen. The higher the resolution is, the greater the detail of the displayed content.. Information about the number of pixels per centimeter (ppcm) or per inch (ppi) of the display. The higher the pixel density, the more detailed and clearer is the information displayed on the screen.. The color depth of the display is also known as bit depth. It shows the number of bits used for the color components of one pixel. Information about the maximum number of colors the screen can display.. The estimated percentage of the screen area from the device's front area.. Information about other functions and features of the display.. Sensors vary in type and purpose. They increase the overall functionality of the device, in which they are integrated.. Digital cameras use image sensors for taking photos. The sensor characteristics are some of the main factors determining the quality of the camera integrated in the mobile device.. Aperture (f-stop number) indicates the size of the lens diaphragm opening, which controls the amount of light reaching the image sensor. The lower the f-stop number, the larger the diaphragm opening is.. Cameras of mobile devices use mainly a LED or a Xenon flash. The LED flash has a softer burst of light and in contrast to the much brighter Xenon flash, is used for recording videos as well.. One of the main characteristics of the cameras of mobile devices is their resolution, which shows the number of pixels on the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the image.. Information about the maximum resolution available for shooting a video with the device.. Information about the maximum number of frames per second (fps), supported by the device while recording a video at maximum resolution. Some of the main standard frame rates for recording and playing video are 24p, 25p, 30p, 60p.. Information about additional software and hardware features of the privamery camera, which improve its overall performance.. Aperture (f-stop number) indicates the size of the lens diaphragm opening, which controls the amount of light reaching the image sensor. The lower the f-stop number, the larger the diaphragm opening is.. Information about the maximum image resolution of the secondary camera. Often, the resolution of the secondary camera is lower than the one of the primary camera.. Information about the maximum resolution available for shooting a video by the secondary camera.. Information about the maximum number of frames per second (fps), supported by the secondary camera while recording a video at maximum resolution.. The loudspeaker is a device, which reproduces various sounds such as ring tones, alarms, music, voice calls, etc. Information about the type of speakers the device uses.. Information whether the device has an FM radio receiver or not.. The tracking/positioning service is provided by various satellite navigation systems, which track the autonomous geo-spatial positioning of the device that supports them. The most common satellite navigation systems are the GPS and the GLONASS. There are also non-satellite technologies for locating mobile devices such as the Enhanced Observed Time Difference, Enhanced 911, GSM Cell ID.. Wi-Fi communication between devices is realized via the IEEE 802.11 standards. Some devices have the possibility to serve as Wi-Fi Hotspots by providing internet access for other nearby devices.

Well I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks now, and when I say charmed I really mean it, it has just taken me a while to digest that I finally got a beast of an product. To tell you guys my history I haven't been completely on an smart phone for about 2 years now due to some personal reasons.. As I was very skeptical about the next phone I want I did a lot of research and to be really true at that time A9 pro was some where in the unknown territory. For a matter of fact I never even had it in my shortlist. When the salesman showed me other options for wat I asked c9 pro and a9 pro were the only ones that impressed me, though had one plus, Mi and Asus on the top of my head.. The next thing i realized was typing my pin to confirm the transaction. Finally as destiny unveiled I was stunned by the look and feel while unboxing this beast. After getting it setup, somewhere in the corner of my mind I still had the urge for c9 pro but had to live with the truth that a9 pro is what I had bought.. Well as the days passed I once again starting in falling in love with It, as the daily tasks, that incmuded a bit of gaming a lot of phone calls, a nights full of music, and substantial browsing and setting up the phone I was always left for ample amount of battery to run the same operation next day as well without charging.. The applications run super smooth and as I have loaded the phone with applications, music, videos, themes and books that a phenatic beginner wanna be geek like me would require it charms me every day.. There are just 3 issues that I had faced with this beautiful device. It's a bit heavy and definitely not a one handed phone, as they say, but what I was looking for was a big screen and good battery backup, so I guess this is the price that I have to pay. Flaunting it definitely raises some eye brows, but the classy and glassy look with its size makes it a bit difficult to hold. As it is complete glass and with no protection has to be handled carefully due to its smooth and slilpery nature. But again class is always not anyone'seen cup of tea. The price drops and ads and promotion.This is really scaring the sh*t out of me. Anywhere you see there is comparison between a9 and name any phone in its category or above, and every where you see a9 pro is a top notch. Either this phone is having some problems and the manufacturers or importers have too much stock to handle, or the phone is bugged as there are a lot of default applications and capturing personal data that cannot be rooted. With the precautionary methods taken I think it is still worth to own this device until kept secure.. But any ways, as far as I am concerned I completely overwhelmed with my usage experience. This is definitely the best phone I have had or used. Hope it stands likewise at least for an year..
