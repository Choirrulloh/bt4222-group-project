Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better!

more ... more .... more ... more .... Dimensions 5.76 x 2.88 x 0.32 inches (146.3 x 73.2 x 8.2 mm). Weight 5.36 oz (152 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution 720 x 1280 pixels. Features Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features Album art cover, Background playback. Notifications Haptic feedback, Music ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Other VoIP, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

LG K8 (2018), K10 (2018) Launched Ahead of MWC 2018: Specifications, Features. Posted By: admin on: February 22, 2018 In: Technologies No Comments. LG K8 (2018) specifications and features. LG K10 (2018) specifications and features. LG on Thursday unveiled the 2018 editions of its K8 and K10 smartphones, saying they would be launched at MWC 2018. Both new smartphones will roll out globally in key regions, including Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East, the South Korean company said in a press statement. The announcement comes just days ahead of Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2018. The handsets are designed as the successors to the K8 (2017) and K10 (2017) that were launched at CES in January last year.. Between the LG K8 (2018) and LG K10 (2018) , the former is the inferior offering. However, LG has confirmed that both handsets will carry over its glossy pebble identity that has been a key element of the K series’ identity since the launch of the first-generation K8 that happened back in March 2016. The smartphones have 2.5D Arc Glass build and will come in three new colour options: Aurora Black, Moroccan Blue, and Terra Gold. Additionally, there are preloaded features such as a new Low Light Noise Reduction option and High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode. The smartphones also have a new Timer Helper feature that will help users keep count the seconds until the timer triggers the shutter using the flash as a visual aid. Similarly, the company has provided a Flash Jump Shot that captures a photo every three seconds (up to 20 photos) and stitch them together into a GIF for easy sharing. The feature can be used with either the front or the rear camera.. The Android 7.1.2 Nougat running LG K8 (2018) features a 5-inch HD (720×1280 pixels) On-Cell display that has a pixel density of 294ppi. The smartphone has a 1.3GHz quad-core SoC, coupled with 2GB of RAM. For capturing images and recording videos, it has an 8-megapixel camera sensor on the rear along with an LED flash and a 5-megapixel camera sensor on the front. There are also new camera UX features such as Auto Shot, Gesture Shot, Flash for Selfie, and Quick Share.. On the part of storage, the LG K8 (2018) has 16GB of onboard storage that is expandable via microSD card (up to 32GB). The smartphone has 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth v4.2, GPS/ A-GPS, FM radio, and Micro-USB on the connectivity front. Besides, it packs a 2500mAh battery and weighs 152 grams.. The Android 7.1.2 Nougat-based LG K10 (2018), on the other hand, features a 5.3-inch HD (720×1080 pixels) In-Cell display with 277ppi of pixel density. The smartphone has a 1.5GHz octa-core SoC and comes in three variants, namely the LG K10 (2018), the K10+ (2018) , and K10 Alpha (2018) aka K10a (2018) , that offer 3GB and 2GB RAM options. While the K10+ (2018) and K10 (2018) variants have a 13-megapixel rear camera sensor and 8-megapixel or 5-megapixel (wide-angle) front camera sensor options, the K10a (2018) has an 8-megapixel rear camera sensor and a 5-megapixel front camera sensor. The front camera sensor of the K10 (2018) family supports a Bokeh effect, especially for selfies. Plus, there has Phase Detection Autofocus (PDAF) that is touted to be 23 percent faster than a traditional autofocus system.. Likewise, the K10+ (2018) has 32GB of internal storage, while the K10 (2018) and K10a (2018) have 16GB storage. All the three variants have storage expansion support via microSD card (up to 2TB). LG has provided 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth v4.2, GPS/ A-GPS, NFC, FM radio, and Micro-USB. There is also a fingerprint sensor that functions as a Quick Shutter and Quick Capture to let users easily capture their photos or screenshots directly using their fingers. Lastly, the smartphone has 3000mAh battery and weighs 162 grams.. “LG’s 2018 K Series range of smartphones is focused on delivering even more value to consumers looking for the right device that fits their lifestyle and needs,” said Ha Jeung-uk, senior vice president and business unit leader for LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company, in the statement.. As we mentioned, LG will showcase the K8 (2018) and K10 (2018) models at the forthcoming MWC. Price and availability of the smartphones are likely to be announced locally.. Last week, LG revealed that it is also building the V30 2018 version with AI-based image recognition features. The advanced features that come through the company’s proprietary Vision AI technology are expected to debut at the MWC, alongside the new K series handsets..
