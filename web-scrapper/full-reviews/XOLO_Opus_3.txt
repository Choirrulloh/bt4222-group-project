Xolo Opus 3: The Selfie Fanaticism is back on a Budget Xolo comes in with the most recent launch following the advent of the elusive Opus series. The recently launched Opus 3 has a lot to offer in terms of utility and specifications whereas the dual SIM supportive gadget promises quite a lot. One might regard this one as the selfie focused Smartphone which allows the user to click in quite a lot without having to search for other options. This common trend has been taken up pretty effectively by the company which has added a lot more than just the camera modules. Pros: The display size is pretty hefty whereas the processor comes in as one pacey inclusion. The RAM allotment is pretty sizeable for this budget module whereas the KitKat support provides the needed spunk. Cons: The internal storage is limiting whereas the resolution on offer is nothing encouraging. Lack of LTE support might be an impending factor while the design cues could have been better. The Opus 3 assumes a sizeable limit which would look to offer a lot in terms of utility while focusing upon the nooks and crannies of the same. Here is a detailed review which enumerates every single aspect with utmost detailing: Design: The plastic make is persisted with whereas the gadget looks pretty pleasant. What pans out is the better designing options put into use by Xolo which adopts a simplistic layout besides the textured back. The gripping support is better whereas the camera units are fixed onto the same pretty seamlessly. Be it the dual SIM slots or the micro SD utility, the manufacturers have put in quite a lot in terms of usability and seamlessness. Display: The 5 inch panel is a pretty strong statement for a budget Smartphone which is pretty well backed up by the HD resolution. What looks more of a letdown is the offered resolution at 720p which could have been scaled up to something sizeable. The options however are taken well care of by the IPS LCD panel which is extremely vibrant and also takes care of the viewing angles which are being talked about. Display sharpness is commendable whereas the clarity and size make for the stronger points. Operating Platform: This handset is all set to involve the latest operating platform in KitKat 4.4 which picks up from where the Jellybean left. The app drawer is one extensive option while the user can now handle the navigation bar pretty effectively. Hardware Specs: The Opus 3 comes in with the quad-core processor which is pretty sizeable for the given budget handset. This would be the first instance of the company adding in the MediaTek SoC with the clock speed corresponding to the 1.3GHz level. The company previously made use of the Broadcomm and snapdragon orientated options but at the given price range MediaTek appears to be the more prudent option. In comes the Mali 400 MP2 GPU which comes in with better graphical performances thus offering multitasking needs and other graphic intensive options. Storage: The internal memory allotment is pretty restrictive at 8GB which isn’t quite enough for a more enthusiastic user. Moreover a better part of the internal memory is taken up by the OS which leaves a pretty sorry state for the users to look at. The expandable storage limit of 32GB is quite staggering but adding the micro-SD card may slow down the gadget performances a fair bit. RAM support comes in at 1GB which is pretty sizeable for the cost and price range ventured into. Camera: Two camera modules can be seen added to the hierarchy with the primary one being set at 8MP. This hardware allotment is pretty sizeable which readily involves the LED flashlight in addition to the other imaging suites. The focus here is on the front camera which has been specially designed and loaded for the selfie fanatics as the 5MP front shooter is certainly one of the beefier inclusions. The wide angled lens set at 88 degrees packs in a lot of intuition whereas the f/2.0 is the aperture size concerning the same. LED flashlight is also included which adds to the popularity of the same. Battery: This handset packs in a 2500mAh unit which delivers a lot of juice and firepower. Be it the 13 hours of 3G talktime or 26 hours of 2G life-time , this battery pack supports a lot and makes the device go on for days at average usage. Conclusion: The Xolo Opus 3 comes in with a promising layout which features multiple specs in the form of strong camera hardware and the faster processor. This could be the perfect budget Smartphone for satiating the basic user needs with a special inclination towards the selfies.
