Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (MediaTek) - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 ‚Ä¶ 102 103 ¬ª. hmm i bought this a phone about a year ago and i think im a little disappointed because the snapdragon version of this version is much better and supported by xiaomi itself :(. Md sany, 13 Feb 2018 Yes my front camera is like what you said.But my rear camera not bad. In my reminder note 4 mobile is not working normal camera? And any cast mplus2 not with ordinary tv. Hayder, 29 Sep 2017 I have recently bought this set,(Global Edition 4gb/64gb) everything is perfect like shape/des... more Yes my front camera is like what you said.But my rear camera not bad. Ravi, 23 Jan 2018 My redmi note 4 left side speker didn't work its not speaker its normal because the left side is mic. I've been using it for more than one and half years and the performance is exactly the same as i bought it even with everyday playing graphics intensive 3d games like asphalt 8,modern combat 5,nfs no limits etc..yeah asphalt 8 on highest setting lags when heat occurs bt of course it doesn't matter for this price range. Multitasking handles with ease, faster web browsing, 4k hdr video runs smoothly and display is amazing... (on the basic of 1 yr experience)If you are looking for a promising phone under 14 k,I gonna tell your redmi note 4 will never disappoint you.battery& camera &features are awesome in this phone.no hanging issue.only one problem that will disappoints you hardly is dead pixel problem .which occurs in 3of5 phones.but that is not a big issue because they are only visible at black wallpaper. Otherwise redmi note 4 is nightmare for oppp vivo and Samsung budget phone&#128519;. My Redmi Note 4, isn't vibrance. My note 4 phone's contact have problem, someone's no, showing some one others name. Ravi, 23 Jan 2018 My redmi note 4 left side speker didn't work That's because there's no left speaker. My redmi note 4 left side speker didn't work. Even after a year of use still has the same performance as new.. Lower price with reasonable cameras bt performance is not reasonable. This phn is very fast and intense tasker. For a long time, it's going to be great performer to me.. A powerful soc like mtk x20 won't get update from xiaomi. If it gets nougat then graphics will be more strong with less overheating issue.. Dearest fact following knowledge enthusiasts.Plus complete flawless gsmArena review.Just with respect to the affordable price and regardless of having not popular hybrid,and NFC it i. one of the most ququality midrange of 2017 thought Xiaomi itself is one of the most successful smartdevice maker of 2017 in many countries!But a successful entity must also respect its customers rights too and not forgetting and evading them!!On the base of research and investigation , all redemi note 4 users are waiting for its upgrade to android 7 and 8 which is their trust and hopeful rights!Since nowadays people worldwide look for qualities and remember being evaded and forgotten!Hopefully Xiaomi at least reads my friendly unbiased suggestion ! Justice Right.Omid12Omidvar searches and writes just like gsmArena and has no relations with no brands based on moral guidelines....Thanks mentioned names..... It's arrived 2 days ago the update miui 9.2.2.0 for mediatek readmi note 4x. But how many errors are there on my two phones, it is detected cpu hexa core instead of deca core, in many options windows so many errors of graphics with various strange doodles, the times disappeared for the nation Italy but if you set India appears the times. I reported the errors, so many ..... No nougat on 9.2.2.0 for redmi note 4 mtk. In fact, there, probably, won't ever be a nougat update for this phone. tytyr, 29 Dec 2017 28 dec 2017 i received i guest last update MIUI 9,2,2,0 GLOBAL VERSION nothing about android oreo Did u get nougat before..?. currently updating to miui v 9.2.2.0. 28 dec 2017 i received i guest last update MIUI 9,2,2,0 GLOBAL VERSION nothing about android oreo. I think this Helio X20/X25 soc are probably the first MTK chipset on pair with Snapdragon chipsets. I have 2 phones running SD 625 and this one running MTK H X20 and there is huge difference in speed. Helio X20 is much faster and responsive compering to SD625. X20 is also more power thirsty but still, with 4000mAt battery it lasts a whole day +some more. SD625 is like VW Golf diesel that is not always super fast but can very easily last for 2 days with same battery. I wander why Xiaomi stop using SD 650 (RN3 pro/plus) coz they were really good compromise between performance and battery life,. Or why is there no SD 630/660 chipsets in any of these phones..

Performance & Battery Life Report: Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 with MediaTek Helio X20. by Matt Humrick on February 23, 2017 7:00 AM EST. 151.0 x 76.0 x 8.35 mm. 151.0 x 76.0 x 8.45 mm. 4GB / 3GB / 2GB LPDDR3. 64GB / 32GB / 16GB (eMMC 5.0). 2G / 3G / 4G LTE (Category 6). FDD-LTE / TD-LTE / TD-SCDMA / WCDMA / CDMA / GSM. 2G / 3G / 4G LTE (Category 7/13). FDD-LTE / TD-LTE / WCDMA / GSM. As a member of Xiaomi‚Äôs more affordable Redmi series, the Note 4 does not have a curved screen, a ceramic body, or the latest flagship hardware like Xiaomi‚Äôs more expensive models, but it does pack a 5.5-inch IPS LCD display, a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, and a 13MP camera with PDAF into a solid-feeling aluminum chassis. This report is more concerned with its internal hardware, however, focusing on the Redmi Note 4‚Äôs system performance, gaming performance, and battery life.. We previously reviewed Xiaomi's Redmi Note 3 Pro , the international version with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 SoC. Its big.LITTLE combination of two Cortex-A72 and four A53 CPU cores delivered excellent performance well above its low-priced competitors and their octa-core A53 SoCs. While the lower-power, in-order A53 core performs well enough over a range of light to moderate workloads, it falls far short of its bigger brother when dealing with more complex tasks such as rendering Web pages. Pairing the Snapdragon 650 with a large 4050mAh battery also gave the Redmi Note 3 Pro good battery life, with 12 hours of screen-on-time in our Wi-Fi browsing test.. Like previous Notes, the Redmi Note 4 comes in two different versions. The international version comes with a Snapdragon 625 SoC, an octa-core A53 configuration built on the 14nm LPP FinFET process with all eight cores reaching up to 2.0GHz. We'll be taking a look at the Chinese version, however, which comes with a MediaTek Helio X20 SoC and three different memory/storage configurations: 3GB/64GB, 3GB/32GB, and 2GB/16GB. The international version tops out at 4GB/64GB, retains the 3GB/32GB configuration, and offers more internal storage in the base model at 2GB/32GB. Both versions support microSD cards for storage expansion, though.. The Helio X20 version‚Äôs software is also specific to China, with preinstalled apps that cater to this market, some of which stand in for Google apps and services that are not installed by default. It's also not uncommon for region-specific ROMs to differ in performance as well as features, catering to the demands of local users.. The MediaTek Helio X20 stands out for being the first SoC to use 10 CPU cores arranged in a Max.Mid.Min tri-cluster configuration. The Max cluster contains 2 A72 cores that provide a burst of performance for heavier tasks and improve overall responsiveness. The Mid cluster uses 4 A53 cores with a max operating point of 1846MHz that consume less power than the more complex A72 cores but still offer a reasonable level of performance for common workloads. The Min cluster also contains 4 A53 cores but they only ramp up to a max frequency of 1391MHz, and are intended for light workloads or background tasks where power efficiency is more important than performance.. It‚Äôs best to think of the three CPU clusters like gears in a car. If you want to go faster or need more torque because a heavy load is placed on the engine, like climbing a hill, you select a different gear. Likewise, when you‚Äôre just cruising down the freeway at a constant speed, you shift into overdrive to maintain your speed and improve fuel efficiency.. MediaTek‚Äôs CorePilot 3.0 software is responsible for selecting the right gear, its scheduler shifting threads between CPU clusters and working with the CPUFreq framework to adjust CPU frequency to achieve the right balance between performance and power consumption. CorePilot increases the sampling rate for adjusting CPU frequency, a method it calls Fast DVFS, so the system can respond more quickly to changes in load.. CorePilot also includes a feature called iCore that modifies the kernel‚Äôs CPU hotplug mechanism. A system always needs at least one CPU active to handle critical tasks like interrupt handling and running the operating system. By default the Linux kernel reserves CPU0 for this task, which in the case of the X20 is the first physical CPU in the Min cluster; however, keeping CPU0 and its cluster active at all times unnecessarily increases power consumption for the X20‚Äôs tri-cluster design. The iCore feature solves this problem by migrating the tasks statically assigned to CPU0 to a CPU in the Mid cluster, allowing the Min cluster to power down when not needed.. The Helio X20 uses MediaTek‚Äôs Coherent System Interconnect (MCSI) to provide hardware-based cache coherence, enabling faster thread migration between CPU clusters. The 2x32bit 933MHz LPDDR3 memory interface cannot provide the same amount of bandwidth as the LPDDR4 memory systems in current flagship phones, but it should be sufficient for the modest Mali-T880MP4 GPU.. Until now, the Meizu Pro 6 was the only device we tested that employed MediaTek‚Äôs tri-cluster approach. Its Helio X25 SoC is the same as the X20, but uses higher peak frequencies (2.52GHz / 2.00GHz / 1.55GHz) for the Max, Mid, and Min CPU clusters, respectively. Unfortunately, the Meizu Pro 6 performed poorly in our initial tests. A closer analysis revealed that the Pro 6 was not migrating threads to its two A72 cores under heavier loads like it should, effectively behaving and performing more like a device with an octa-core A53 CPU arrangement. While it‚Äôs unfortunate that Meizu would ship a product in this condition, it did eventually adjust CorePilot‚Äôs load threshold values to allow proper thread migration, which we noticed after retesting the Pro 6 with Flyme OS 5.2.5.0G. If anything, this experience highlights the important role OEMs play in tuning the software parameters that control a device‚Äôs CPU scheduling and DVFS systems, customizing the balance between performance and power consumption.. Now it‚Äôs time to see how the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and its Helio X20 SoC fare in our performance and battery life tests. Will it utilize its big cores effectively and be able to match the performance of the Redmi Note 3 Pro and other, higher-cost phones? Will its large 4100mAh battery keep it chugging along or will SoC or display inefficiencies reduce battery life? How will its scores compare to the updated results for the Meizu Pro 6 and its higher clocked X25 SoC?. Please log in or sign up to comment.. serendip - Thursday, February 23, 2017 - link. Isn't there a new Redmi Note 4 variant with a Snapdragon 625? XDA reviewed that, comparing it with the older 652-based Note 3 and found that the newer phone was slightly slower but had even better battery life. They're serial violators of the GPL, enough said. BMNify - Thursday, February 23, 2017 - link. Snapdragon version is being sold in India and Mediatek version is being sold in China. h0007h - Friday, February 24, 2017 - link. 625 version is also sold in China, which is named Redmi Note4X. jospoortvliet - Monday, February 27, 2017 - link. It seems the Mediatek is at least a big part of the reason for the lower battery life, GPL violations and resulting lack of support longevity aside. That the 625 is slower with longer battery life makes sense given its octa core a53. Dropping the higher performing a72's for more but slower a53's is not a step forward unless all you care about is battery life... djayjp - Thursday, February 23, 2017 - link. Wish the OnePlus 3T was in all the benchmark results, not just the storage ones.... Lodix - Thursday, February 23, 2017 - link. Matt the X20 is a lower binmed SOC so it has worse thermals and power consumption compared to the higher binned X25. Matt Humrick - Thursday, February 23, 2017 - link. Even if the X25's A72 cores could reach 2.5GHz at the same voltage as the X20's at 2.1GHz, the X25's A72 dynamic power would still be higher based on the increase in frequency. While I would need a measurement to confirm this, I suspect that with a mature 20nm planar process that the X25 would need additional voltage to hit 2.5GHz. The Meizu Pro 6's operating table (which usually are not 100% accurate) at least suggests the X25's voltage is higher. In order for the X20 to consume more power and produce more heat than the X25 as you suggest (at least for the big CPU cores), the X25's A72 cores would need both a 19% increase in frequency and an 8% reduction in voltage, which seems unlikely. zodiacfml - Thursday, February 23, 2017 - link. I can't wait for the X30. dexterkarthik - Thursday, February 23, 2017 - link. Redmi Note 4 international variant is a joke. I doesn't have the dual WiFi band as the RN3, downgraded camera pixel count, downgraded CPU and GPU (redmi3s is >90% a RN4 for almost half the price in India). I love this strategy to an extent since it makes me feel happy to own the RM3 for getting 3/4th OnePlus 3 performance for 1/3rd price and since most run behind core count and "LATEST" version, RN3 will start getting discounts and sale, etc :D. WPX00 - Friday, February 24, 2017 - link. The SD625 is a more significant bump to the 617 or 430 than you might expect. GPU is 2-2.5x more powerful, its 14nm process is 35% more efficient, and the CPU is 1.5-2x more powerful thanks to the greater thermal headroom 14nm brings. It is a massive leap forward, in my opinion, a more significant leap than the jump from quad to octa (410 to 61x series). IanCutress : This guy's big mug on a wall @benwood https://t.co/8KavLs4a9W.

Answered Feb 10, 2017 ¬∑ Author has 154 answers and 432.3k answer views. The Redmi note 4 comes in 2 variants i.e the Snapdragon 625 as well as mediatek's helio x20 depending on regions. If we do side by side comparison of chipsets then the helio x20 has 2 cortex A72, 4+4 cortex A53 cores whereas the sd625 has 8 cortex A53 cores. The cortex A72 cores in x20 will make it more powerful in power demanding tasks. However, in terms of power efficiency, the sd625 wins also little amount of heating may take place with x20.. If u prefer heavy performance then x20 variant will be fine. However, for balanced usage then the Snapdragon 625 variant will be my choice.. 26.8k Views ¬∑ View Upvoters ¬∑ Answer requested by Santhosh Karur. Which one is better, a Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Mediatek) or Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x?. Which phone is better Redmi Note 4 or Redmi 4?. What is better, Redmi note 4 (32 GB) or Redmi 4 (64 GB)?. Which is better to buy, a Xiaomi Redmi 4 or a Xiaomi Redmi Note 4?. Which one's better: Mediatek or Snapdragon?. R V , former Retired Technical Personnel Semicon Industry. The chip die size of 625 is 14nm and Helio X20 is 20nm. 20 nm dissipates more heat a it consumes more power and should be faster than Snapdragon. That too depends on software optimization to get the best of the chip without overheating. 130 GFlops Helio P20 (MT6757) - Mali-T880 MP2 20nm. 61.2GFlops Well if Helio X20 if inferior would it be marketed in China when there are many brand choices with other chips. Snapdragon earned a name in SOC but it doesn't mean it is better as Wafer Fab , assembly ....cost is less in Taiwan and China. Heat is a killer for chips and all electronic components and the life shortens. 24 Deg C will have minimal change in values of electronic components for 5 years as per my experience in Semicon Industry on Equipment which run 24/7 a minimal differentiation in values of components for 5 years and tend to slide down after that. External Temps are much higher and components are killed faster. Take an example - a laptop using HDD and SSD - HDD fails faster than SSD which operate to higher temps but the cooling fan of the laptop is never good enough to exhaust the heat dissipated by the components. As for my laptop I use Samsung Evo SSD and also an extractor fan JM Max Pro which is the most powerful one. Other extractor fans are just for name but do not do the job. So just imagine the Components in Smartphones do not have these luxuries and Overloading its use will cause the component value depreciation. Just like earlier Xiaomis had very good performance but gaming, multi-tasking caused it to overheat and its slows down or fails. Through my experience as a Field Service personnel in SEA I would like to impart my knowledge as experienced. Of Course Semicon Equipment cost $200k and above and have multiple exhaust fans and Temperature sensors but does a smartphone have it - NO. Most processor and chips are plastic products not the ceramic ones which could stand extreme Temps. Sorry for the long winded answer hope it helps the readers in related fields to understand electronic Components. 6k Views ¬∑ View Upvoters.

My personal experience Mediatek as a processor is not good. It heats a lot, doesn't gives the performance as it's counterpart in snapdragon can provide, it makes the phone lag and so many other issues.. On contrary, snapdragon from Qualcomm is a well designed, perfectly clocked PROCESSOR. It makes what Note4 exactly is.

Mediatek is no doubt very larger manufacturer of processor, but they are only manufacturing without doing development or innovation. They just copy the structure u like to say.. And Qualcomm processors are also involves for development and research and innovation.. Therefore, if u observe only cheap phone have that mediatek, not Samsung note series, OnePlus, or anyone in high budget phone.. So, according to me, mediatek is best if u want to buy low budget phone and if not then snapdragon there is‚Ä¶. 15.7k Views ¬∑ View Upvoters. In the Chinese market Xiaomi introduced Redmi Note 4 with Media Tek‚Äô Helio X 20 chipset. For the Indian market they went for snapdragon 625. So now the question arises which one is better. In case of performance Chinese variant of Redmi Note 4 powered with Helio X 20 comes victorious. It had the capacity of a flagship product but the company delivered it to its customer at mid range. This is how MediaTek always works .They try to deliver premium features to mid range and hence they clearly dominate in budget phones.. MediaTek‚Äôs Helio x 20 has the following features. 64-bit Helio X20 deca-core chipset clocked at 2.3GHz. (two cortex A72 cores, eight cortex A53 cores) paired with Mali-T880 GPU. Coming to the Snapdragon 625 it is pretty satisfactory but holds no ground performance wise in comparison to MediaTek‚Äôs helio X 20. It comes with eight octa core Cortex A53 cores clocked at 2.0 Ghz.. Conclusion ‚Äì MediaTek‚Äôs Helio x20 delivers much better performance and features in comparison of Snapdragon 625. 2.2k Views ¬∑ View Upvoters.

First of all it‚Äôs like you compare MediaTek and Qualcomm or Helio and Snapdragon, so correct that question.. Now for a phone like Redmi which is a brand mostly catering the mid-range phones demand in the Indian Market, so there is nothing better than MediaTek which has been catering this section for longer time.

Performance & Battery Life Report: Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 with MediaTek Helio X20. by Matt Humrick on February 23, 2017 7:00 AM EST. The Redmi Note 4‚Äôs Helio X20 SoC includes a Mali-T880MP4 GPU running at up to 700MHz. Based on ARM‚Äôs now last-generation Midgard architecture , it still supports all of the latest graphics APIs, including OpenGL ES 3.1 + Android Extension Pack (AEP). The T880 is the highest performing Midgard GPU, with 3 ALUs/core, but MediaTek is using a modest four-core configuration.. We‚Äôve seen this same configuration in HiSilicon‚Äôs Kirin 950/955 (Mali-T880MP4) that‚Äôs used in Huawei‚Äôs Honor 8, Mate 8, and P9. The only difference is the Kirins‚Äô Mali ramps up to 900MHz. The Redmi Note 4‚Äôs lower peak frequency limits FP32 throughput to a theoretical 84 GFLOPS compared to 108 GFLOPS in the three Huawei phones, and because each GPU core contains a single texture unit, along with supporting hardware for triangle setup, tiling, rasterization, etc., it‚Äôs not just ALU performance that‚Äôs limited by using fewer cores; even workloads that are not shader bound take a performance hit.. In the older OpenGL ES 2.0-based GFXBench T-Rex game simulation, both the Redmi Note 4 and Meizu Pro 6 essentially match the Redmi Note 3 Pro‚Äôs performance. readily outpace the Adreno 506 GPU in the Moto Z Play‚Äôs Snapdragon 625 SoC and the T860MP2 GPU in Meizu‚Äôs M3 note. As expected, the Honor 8 performs 24% faster than the Redmi Note 4 based on its frequency advantage.. The Adreno 530 GPU in LeEco‚Äôs Le Pro3 and Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy S7 is the only one in these charts capable of hitting vsync when rendering onscreen. Because all of these phones except for the 1440p Galaxy S7 have 1080p displays, there‚Äôs no appreciable difference between offscreen and onscreen results.. GFXBench Car Chase uses a game engine based on OpenGL ES 3.1 + Android Extension Pack (AEP) and employs several modern features, such as tessellation and compute shaders, that stress ALU performance.. Despite the difference in workload, the results are largely the same. The Honor 8 maintains a nearly 24% advantage over the Redmi Note 4, while the latter still holds the advantage over the lower-end Adreno GPUs in the Moto Z Play and Moto G4 Plus.. 3DMark Sling Shot Extreme uses OpenGL ES 3.1 on Android and stresses the GPU and memory subsystems by rendering offscreen at 1440p (instead of 1080p like our other tests).. With so many pixels to process it‚Äôs no surprise to see the flagship devices using Snapdragon 820/821 or Exynos 8890 SoCs perform at least 4.6x faster than the Redmi Note 4 and the other less-expensive phones, whose GPUs were never intended to drive 1440p displays. While the Note 4, Note 3 Pro, and Pro 6 were pretty evenly matched in the GFXBench tests, the latter two pull ahead of the Note 4 by 25% in this test. In the case of the Note 3 Pro, the larger portion of its advantage (35%) comes in the first graphics test that focuses on geometry processing.. The Physics test, which is based on the Bullet Open Source Physics Library, runs several multi-threaded simulations on the CPU and is heavily influenced by memory controller performance. The Redmi Note 4 handles this workload especially well, effectively leveraging its 10 CPU cores to pull away from the Redmi Note 3 Pro and the other phones in the second and third subtests that each add additional simulation threads.. As its name implies, the Basemark ES 3.1 simulation uses OpenGL ES 3.1 on Android. It‚Äôs a demanding test that uses a number of post-processing, particle, and lighting effects, but does not include tessellation like GFXBench 4.0 Car Chase.. While Qualcomm‚Äôs Adreno GPUs generally provide better ALU performance than ARM‚Äôs Mali GPUs at the same price tier, we‚Äôve consistently seen Mali pull ahead of Adreno in Basemark ES 3.1. In the previous tests, the Redmi Note 4 performed the same as or a little behind the Redmi Note 3 Pro and its Adreno 510 GPU, but here the Note 4 pulls ahead by 7% in the onscreen test.. Most people who list gaming as a priority are probably willing to pay a little extra for a more performant GPU. For phones below the $200 USD mark, like the Redmi Note 4, price/area and power are the motivating criteria. It‚Äôs no surprise then that the peak GPU performance of Xiaomi‚Äôs latest Note falls well below the numbers from mid-range phones and even flagships from a couple years ago like Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy S6; however, its performance is actually quite good compared to the phones it‚Äôs competing with in its price bracket. It also supports the latest graphics APIs and features, including tessellation, and is still capable of playing the majority of games currently available with acceptable frame rates. There are occasional stutters, however, so it would be nice to see a higher peak GPU frequency to boost performance when needed, but I suspect it‚Äôs being limited by the Helio X20‚Äôs 20nm planar process..

XDA reviewed that, comparing it with the older 652-based Note 3 and found that the newer phone was slightly slower but had even better battery life. They're serial violators of the GPL, enough said. BMNify - Thursday, February 23, 2017 - link. Snapdragon version is being sold in India and Mediatek version is being sold in China. h0007h - Friday, February 24, 2017 - link. 625 version is also sold in China, which is named Redmi Note4X. jospoortvliet - Monday, February 27, 2017 - link. It seems the Mediatek is at least a big part of the reason for the lower battery life, GPL violations and resulting lack of support longevity aside. That the 625 is slower with longer battery life makes sense given its octa core a53. Dropping the higher performing a72's for more but slower a53's is not a step forward unless all you care about is battery life... djayjp - Thursday, February 23, 2017 - link. Wish the OnePlus 3T was in all the benchmark results, not just the storage ones.... Lodix - Thursday, February 23, 2017 - link. Matt the X20 is a lower binmed SOC so it has worse thermals and power consumption compared to the higher binned X25. Matt Humrick - Thursday, February 23, 2017 - link. Even if the X25's A72 cores could reach 2.5GHz at the same voltage as the X20's at 2.1GHz, the X25's A72 dynamic power would still be higher based on the increase in frequency. While I would need a measurement to confirm this, I suspect that with a mature 20nm planar process that the X25 would need additional voltage to hit 2.5GHz. The Meizu Pro 6's operating table (which usually are not 100% accurate) at least suggests the X25's voltage is higher. In order for the X20 to consume more power and produce more heat than the X25 as you suggest (at least for the big CPU cores), the X25's A72 cores would need both a 19% increase in frequency and an 8% reduction in voltage, which seems unlikely. zodiacfml - Thursday, February 23, 2017 - link. I can't wait for the X30. dexterkarthik - Thursday, February 23, 2017 - link. Redmi Note 4 international variant is a joke. I doesn't have the dual WiFi band as the RN3, downgraded camera pixel count, downgraded CPU and GPU (redmi3s is >90% a RN4 for almost half the price in India). I love this strategy to an extent since it makes me feel happy to own the RM3 for getting 3/4th OnePlus 3 performance for 1/3rd price and since most run behind core count and "LATEST" version, RN3 will start getting discounts and sale, etc :D. WPX00 - Friday, February 24, 2017 - link. The SD625 is a more significant bump to the 617 or 430 than you might expect. GPU is 2-2.5x more powerful, its 14nm process is 35% more efficient, and the CPU is 1.5-2x more powerful thanks to the greater thermal headroom 14nm brings. It is a massive leap forward, in my opinion, a more significant leap than the jump from quad to octa (410 to 61x series). IanCutress : This guy's big mug on a wall @benwood https://t.co/8KavLs4a9W.

Aditya Misra , Smartphone afficonado and B.S Electrical Engineering. Key differences can be summarized as follows:. Chinese version - Mediatek Helio X20/X25 - 8 Cortex A53 + 2 Cortex A72 + Mali T880 GPU - Faster processor than the one used in the Indian version. Does suffer heating issues from time to time in heavy apps/games.. Indian version - Snapdragon 625 - 8 Cortex A53 + Adreno 505 GPU in a big.Little configuration. Slowest of all the Redmi Note 4 versions due to SD 625. Highly battery efficient due to 14nm process which is a first for a mid range chipset. Single channel memory which inhibits performance at 1080p resolution or more due to limited bandwidth.. Chinese Note 4 - Uses a superior finishing process with a metal unibody design. Looks marginally sleeker due to this.. Indian Note 4 - Uses an older fabrication process which is more like the Note 3, therefore the joins are visible to an extent.. You‚Äôll have to look closely to tell the difference though, on first glance they both look pretty identical.. Everything else is pretty much the same, which includes NAND, Display, Camera and sensors. Image quality will vary due to different ISP used in both the processors. The Chinese Note 4 is more powerful/faster and is better at games/multimedia heavy apps. Battery life is much lower than the Indian version due to the 10 core processor used and the older 20nm fab node.. The Indian Note 4 is much more battery efficient and will last quite a bit longer in normal day to day usage. Runs pretty cool as well with the efficient 14nm A53 cores and light GPU. Performance is quite a bit lower than the Chinese version however.. 18.7k Views ¬∑ View Upvoters. Smart articles! We explain everything you should know on the topic..

The major and only difference between both the variant is it's processors and somewhat body, except that device is perfectly identical.. The Chinese version of Xiaomi uses Mediatek processors whereas the Indian version is powered with a Snapdragon processor in India owing to a court injunction, which restricts the use of MediaTek processor. The Indian variant houses the SD625 whereas the Chinese variant sports the Deca Core Helio X20. On paper it may seem that the SD625 is far inferior to the Helio X20, but infact the SD625 packing Indian variant pulls ahead in real world tests. It seems like the X20 has not been well optimised by Mi. But in case of battery life, the Indian variant is miles ahead of MediTek powered Chinese variant.. Though there are certain differences in the CPU configuration, both these chips are almost on the same level in terms of performance.. There are some key differences in the build of the two variants. See the picture below depicting the arrangement of elements up top of the phone in the Indian variant. The headphone jack at one end, IR blaster and sec. mic bundled at the other end.. But The Chinese variant is different, having the IR blaster at the center, sec. mic and headphone jack to its right and left. Take a look at the image below;. Though they look almost the same, Indian variant has plastic on top and bottom while Chinese one has all metal build with antenna lines and screws on bottom and hece a better and sturdier build. Though the Indian variant is inferior to an extend, it offers better protection against drops as the plastic offer better cushion to the phone. This variation may be a smart move from Mi to make the phone well balanced for the price across all markets as it uses different processors of different cost..

This variation may be a smart move from Mi to make the phone well balanced for the price across all markets as it uses different processors of different cost.. The screws hold the phones metallic back to the body of the phone, and make the phone stronger a lot. This is where the Indian variant is really inferior to the Chinese one. 9.4k Views ¬∑ View Upvoters. Rahul , Founder at üåêBintooShoots.com, India. Answered Nov 5 ¬∑ Author has 343 answers and 172.8k answer views. China variant build is completely metal with antenna lines on the back while Indian variant has plastic strip on top & bottom. This provides better asthetics to China variant but superior signal reception to Indian variant.. China variant runs on mediatek processor while Indian redmi phones run on Snapdragon due to restriction on use of mediatek processors by Xiaomi in India & to avoid lawsuits from rival brands.. China variant comes with MIUI China rom without playstore & Google services because these are banned in China. For Rest of the world gets Xiaomi make miui global ROM with Google services which we get in India.. These are the differences that I know are major but you can see it's best to stick to Redmi Note 4 officially sold in India.

Opinion: Why I am not convinced with Redmi Note 4 design One of the major Redmi Note 4 peeve points is its design.. The ‚Äòmetal unibody‚Äô design with two ‚Äòsymmetrical‚Äô circles ‚Äì a camera sensor followed by a fingerprint reader ‚Äì and two color-matched plastic caps on top and bottom is frankly growing mold.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 China variant with full-metal body and diamond cut edges. So, we weren‚Äôt quite happy about Xiaomi using the old process for the Indian variant of Redmi Note 4, the one that is regressive enough to still use ungainly plastic trimmings on the rear. The diamond cut edges that embellish the all-metal Chinese variant are also missing (and that does matter).. 34.9k Views ¬∑ View Upvoters. Prima facie, on of the main differences is the design of the two variants. While the Chinese variant features a full metal body with diamond cut edges, the Indian one misses them and instead feature old school plastic trimmings on the back..
