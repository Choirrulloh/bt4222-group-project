Chinese smartphone OEM OPPO has launched two new smartphones in China with the release of the Oppo R11s and R11s Plus. These devices are refreshed versions of the OPPO R11 and R11 Plus, which were launched back in June of this year. The main highlights of the OPPO R11s and R11s Plus are their large,. bezel-less displays, both featuring an 18:9 aspect ratio with very small top and bottom bezels.. The OPPO R11s sports a 6.01-inch FullHD+ AMOLED panel from Samsung with an 85.8% screen-to-body ratio and a screen resolution of 2160 x 1080. Moving on to optics, the dual camera setup on the OPPO R11s is comprised of 20MP + 16MP sensors with both sensors utilizing f/1.7 aperture and a large 2µm pixel size for better low-light performance. The front camera is a 20MP shooter with f/2.0 aperture and the company is throwing in features like AI Beauty, portrait mode and scene detection for an enhanced selfie experience.. Under-the-hood, the OPPO R11s is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 octa-core SoC, paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of on-board storage. On the software side, both devices ship with Color OS 3.2 (based on Android 7.1.1) which brings along many new features such as split-screen mode, face unlock, a game acceleration mode, smart gallery and more.. The OPPO R11s Plus is same as the R11s, except it sports a larger 6.43-inch display, a bigger 4,000 mAh battery and 6GB of RAM.. Other specs include a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, Bluetooth 4.2, dualSIM support, and a microSD card slot. Unfortunately, there is no USB Type-C on board but on the flip side, you still get a 3.5mm headphone jack.. The OPPO R11s and R11s Plus are now available for pre-order in China for CNY 2999 and CNY 3699, respectively.

more ... more .... more ... more .... Oppo R11s and R11s Plus now official: Here's what the OnePlus 5T might look like. Oppo R11s and R11s Plus now official: Here's what the OnePlus 5T might look like. by Peter Kostadinov. Tags :. Android - Android + OnePlus - OnePlus +. Chinese smartphone manufacturer Oppo just announced the R11s and R11s Plus, which are both expected to be close relatives of the upcoming OnePlus 5T. In particular, the rumored OnePlus device is rumored of inheriting the general design of the Oppo R11s but would feature a bit beefier specs inside. Anyway, let's talk about the R11s and the beefier R11s Plus. With a stand-out bezelless design and trendy 2:1 displays, the two devices are as contemporary as it gets. While you won't find a Snapdragon 835 inside ( which would definitely be the case for the OnePlus 5T ), the new Oppos would likely prove to be neat upper mid-rangers thanks to the efficient Snapdragon 660 that's powering them. Yet, the true highlight of the Oppo R11s and R11s Plus are their cameras. Both phones feature dual-camera setups (16MP f/1.7) + 20MP f/1.7 at the rear but don't expect ultra wide-angle, tele-photo, or even monochrome solutions. Both cameras have the same field of view and are capable of snapping pictures independently based on the lighting conditions you're shooting in. It's said that the 20MP snapper is optimized for low-light scenarios whereas the 16MP one would be used in any other more favorable scenarios. Here are the specs at a glance:. Specs Oppo R11s Oppo R11s Plus Display 6.01", 1080 x 2160 pixels, 9:18 aspect, Gorilla Glass 5 6.43", 1080 x 2160 pixels, 9:18 aspect, Gorilla Glass 5 Screen -to-body ratio. 85.5% - Chipset Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 RAM 4GB 6GB Storage 64GB +microSD 64GB +microSD Battery 3,205mAh, VOOC Flash fast charging 3,205mAh, VOOC Flash fast charging Rear cameras 16Mp f/1.7 + 20Mp f/1.7, 20μm pixels 16Mp f/1.7 + 20Mp f/1.7, 20μm pixels Front cameras 20MP 20MP Additional features Fingerprint scanner headphone jack, microUSB port, no NFC Fingerprint scanner headphone jack, microUSB port, no NFC OS Android 7.x Nougat, ColorOS 3.2 UI Android 7.x Nougat, ColorOS 3.2 UI Colors Black, Red, Champagne - Price Black/Champagne: CNY 2,999 (~$450) Red: CNY 3,199 ($482) CNY: 3,699 (~$560) Release date November 10 (China) November 10 (China). So, we largely believe that the Oppo R11s could be used as a foundation for the OnePlus 5T, which would likely go official pretty soon given that Oppo has unleashed its latest devices to the Chinese market. So, expect the upcoming never-settling handset to look a lot like the ones you can see in the gallery right below. Sony Xperia XZ2 impressions: Gone with the old, in with the new.

Both devices share the same specs except for the fact that the OPPO R11s Plus features a larger display, a juicier battery and enhanced RAM compared to the OPPO R11s.. OPPO launched the OPPO R11s and the OPPO R11s Plus with a bezel-less display and dual cameras earlier this month. However, only the OPPO R11s was made available to buy along with the promise that OPPO R11s Plus would go on sale at a later date. And now sticking to the promise the OPPO R11s Plus has also hit the shelves in China.. The OPPO R11s Plus carries largely the same specs as that of the OPPO R11s, at the same time, it differs in some of the aspects. The OPPO R11s Plus comes with a bigger sized display and battery, as well as bumping up the memory as against the OPPO R11s. It is offered at CNY 3,699 (Approx. PHP 26,000) in two color variants: Black and Champagne Gold.. The OPPO R11s Plus features a 6.43-inch full HD+ bezel-less display with 18:9 aspect ratio and Gorilla Glass 5 layer of protection.

As for the imaging department, the smartphone tacks on a dual-rear camera setup with 16MP+20MP camera configuration with LED flash and f/1.7 aperture. On the front, it mounts a 16 MP selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.. The OPPO R11s Plus runs on Android 7.1.1 Nougat underneath the ColorOS 3.2. Backing up the device is a non-removable 4,000 mAh battery. Amongst other things, it features a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, facial recognition feature and 3.5 mm audio jack. The connectivity options include 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, microSD, and dual SIM slots.. Considering the price tag the OPPO R11s Plus will be up against the recently launched OnePlus 5T , which is kitted out with slightly better specs. As of now, the company has kept mum about the launch of both the OPPO R11s and R11s Plus in the Phillipines. But given that the Chinese OEMs are swift with regard to carrying over their devices to the Phillipines, OPPO mightn't afford to keep it out of bounds of the Philippine market for longer..

Mobiles / Oppo Mobile Phones / Oppo R11s Plus Price in India. User Visits: 3,980 Compare. Oppo sits firmly among the popular chinese smartphone manufacturers to witness huge success in the Indian market. Oppo is mostly famous for its camera centric smartphones and offers some impressive features in its lineup. However, it misses out on the reputation front, as most chinese products do. But, considering the inexpensive offerings along with some key features, people love this brand. Similarly, Oppo has launched another camera-oriented smartphone in its line-up along with some goodies, Oppo R11s Plus. Before you make up mind to buy this smartphone, go through the below mentioned key elements of the smartphone to decide on the same.. Everyone loves smartphones which come with an excellent battery backup. A powerful phone is of no use, if it is not backed efficiently by a strong battery. The Oppo R11s Plus is similar to what users look for in a smartphone, as it carries a massive 4,000mAh battery to fuel it. Moreover, it comes with a quick charging feature which is an added advantage of the device.. Unlike other Chinese brands, Oppo stresses more on providing key features to its product to boost its performance. The Oppo R11s Plus seems to be a powerful performer, as it is offered with a perfect blend of superior processor and huge RAM capacity. It is offered with an Octa core processor, which is aided by a 6GB RAM along with an Adreno 512 GPU to deliver seamless and lag-free performance.. Oppo smartphones are synonymous to good quality photography. It offers a dual primary camera setup with 20MP+16MP resolution at the rear, which produces sharp quality images along with good quality videography. The selfie camera of the device is the major attraction for the selfie lovers. As the 20MP front camera delivers impressive selfies and aids video calling to stay connected with your dear ones.. Powerful Battery with quick charging feature. The Hybrid SIM slot is one of biggest loophole for many smartphones, as it provides a single slot for two purpose. In a Hybrid SIM slot you can either insert a second SIM or an external memory chip at one time.

These days, everyone uses dual SIM connectivity which makes the absence of dedicated memory slot a major issue on the storage aspect.. There should not be two thoughts while buying the smartphone, as it is a delightful device for those who are selfie freaks along with its lag-free performance.
