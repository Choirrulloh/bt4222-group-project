Gionee S10 With Four Cameras Launched: Price, Release Date, Specifications, and More. Shekhar Thakran , 26 May 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Gionee S10 and S10C will be made available on June 9. Gionee S10B will be made available from Friday. Gionee S10 comes with 6GB of RAM. Gionee on Friday launched its S10 smartphone at an event in China. While the highlight feature of the new smartphone, the dual camera setups at front and back, was already leaked in weeks ahead of the launch, the smartphone has been launched in three variants - regular S10, S10B, and S10C. S10C will be made available for purchase in China from June 9 while the S10B will be made available from Friday itself.. First moving to the regular variant of the Gionee S10 , as we mentioned before, the unique selling point of the phone is its camera department. The smartphone features a 16-megapixel sensor and an 8-megapixel sensor at the rear with 6P lens and f/1.8 aperture. At the front, it comes with a 20-megapixel sensor along with an 8-megapixel sensor.. The successor to last year's Gionee S9 , Gionee S10 runs Amigo 4.0 OS and sports a 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) In-Cell display, and is powered by a MediaTek Helio P25 SoC coupled with 6GB of RAM. It comes with 64GB of inbuilt storage, and sports a 3450mAh battery, an improvement over last year's Gionee S9. The Gionee S10 has been priced at CNY 2,599 (roughly Rs. It is currently unclear if the storage is expandable and Gionee has not confirmed the Android version on the smartphone.. Moving to the Gionee S10B , the smartphone has been priced at CNY 2,199 (roughly Rs. 20,700) and also features a dual camera setup with a 13-megapixel and 5-megapixel sensors at back and a 16-megapixel sensor at front. The S10B also runs Amigo 4.0, features a 5.5-inch full-HD display, and is powered by a MediaTek Helio P10 processor coupled with 4GB of RAM. The Gionee S10B comes with 64GB of in-built storage. The smartphone houses a large 3700mAh battery.. Finally coming to the least expensive model of the three, Gionee S10C has been priced at CNY 1,599 (roughly Rs. The smartphone comes with a single 13-megapixel sensor at the back and a 16-megapixel sensor at the front. Just like the other two phones, the Gionee S10C runs Amigo 4.0 OS but sports a 5.2-inch HD display and is powered by a Snapdragon 427 processor coupled with 4GB of RAM. The smartphone comes with 32GB of built-in storage that's expandable via microSD card (up to 128GB), and houses a 3100mAh battery.. The connectivity options offered by the Gionee S10 models were not shared by the company at the launch event. Stay tuned in for more details on the smartphones..

This is a BETA experience. You may opt-out by clicking here. I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. The Gionee S10 in multiple colors.. Is more always better? To Chinese smartphone companies, the answer is always yes. Gionee's newest phone, the S10, has four cameras -- two on each side of the device. Each pair work in unison to craft photos featuring the. "bokeh effect." Unlike other phones that do it via software, Gionee says it wrote its own ISP (image signal processor) algorithm to produce the depth-of-field with hardware. Meaning the blur that appears in the background behind the subject is produced in real-time by the dual-camera sensors, not software trickery.. The Gionee S10 comes in four colors, including the blue and green pictured here and gold and black.. What that means in the real world results is a bit of hit and miss.. When the perfect lighting situation and positioning align, the bokeh effect looks great, but other times the blur looks artificial, sometimes cutting into a subject's head. Shot using the S10's bokeh mode.. Notice here, the background blur looks natural, but the logo of the perfume also suffered from the bokeh effect when it shouldn't.. For normal shots without the gimmickry, t he S10's rear 16-megapixel main shooter can capture sharp and vibrant images outdoors, but suffers in low light despite the f/1.8 aperture.. Notice the detail in the petals.. The camera software is intuitive with a nice set of additional software features such as 3D photos and "group selfie," which is like a panorama shot but with the front lens. The main front-firing selfie cam, by the way is a whopping 20-megapixels, producing images of my face that's way too large for my own comfort (prettier people may love it though). The two selfie-lens are flanked by a dedicated flash that's softer on the skin than other the typical LED flash.. I've gone on record with my disdain for selfies, so this feature has no use to me; but if you have a need to snap selfies inside a dimly lit bar, well the S10 has got you covered.. on Forbes : Inside Gionee: A Visit To The Chinese Phonemaker's Manufacturing Plant. Moving onto the hardware: the S10, as you can see, is not the most original looking device, but it's very well-built with a fast fingerprint reader located on the front of the device surrounding a capacitive touch home button. Unfortunately, the back button is on the wrong side (aka the default Samsung way) of the device. The bezels are also rather large by 2017 standards, but overall this is a pleasant looking phone with soft/round corners and sides.. The home button is not a physical button.. Helio P25 chip -- the newest processor of MediaTek -- and 6GB of RAM. Combined they make the S10 quite snappy; Gionee's cleaned up amigoOS helps a lot. Now at version 4.0, Gionee's take on Android is a typical Chinese skin, that means. square-ish icons a la iOS, no app tray, and shortcut toggles that needs to be swiped from bottom of the display. Though it's no stock Android, the aesthetics here is quite pleasing to the eye, particularly the all black notification shades that also separate notifications by importance (the phone does quite a good job of knowing which notification is import and which is fluff). There are some shortcut gestures, such as double tap on screen to wake the phone, which I love. The native Gionee web browser is a buggy mess though -- you'll switch to Chrome in no time.. Gionee has gone on record stating it makes phones for either of two groups : businessmen/politicians or young millennials. The S10, with the four cameras and selfie flash, is obviously aimed at the latter, but still, Gionee brought over some security features from the M series, such as "Private Space," which is a section of the phone that stores apps and media in a partitioned section of the hard drive. That means you can run a second version of WhatsApp or Facebook in there that behaves completely independent from the main versions on the home screen. Any photos or messages stored inside the "Private Space" won't show (nor are they searchable) outside on the main phone too. This is a very useful feature for people with things to hide (makes sense, then, that Gionee is so keen to say the security features were built for politicians).. Yes, the design looks a wee bit familiar.... The dual camera set-up in the back.. The phone ran smoothly in my week of daily use, and handled. as Mortal Kombat X with no problems. The 3,450 mAh battery, as per usual with Chinese phones, can last me more than a full day. I routinely finish 12-hour days with 35% battery left. That's partly because Chinese software have aggressive battery optimization, but also because the 1080p screen doesn't eat up battery as much as a 2k resolution.. Overall the S10 is a solid, if unspectacular phone. The bokeh tricks can produce some genuinely impressive shots, but how many photos of blurred sides do you need? The software experience isn't bad, but. you'd most likely slap a skin on this anyway if you're a western user. The big saving grace may be the price tag. just 2599 yuan (US$378), the S10 ticks most of the boxes you'd need for a phone,.

I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. The Gionee S10 in four colors.. Last week I teased a new phone with four camera from Gionee, and today the Chinese phonemaker has made it official with a launch event in Shanghai. The S10's official spec list includes two front-firing lens at 20-megapixel and 8-megapixel, and rear shooters of 16- and 8-megapixels. The 16-megapixel rear camera (aka the "main" camera) has an f/1.8 aperture, which means it should be quite solid in low light performance.. The S10 is in line with Gionee's established business model -- its M series, with an emphasis on security and raw power, is catered towards businessmen or people with sensitive information (like, say, a politician), while the S series is for youngsters. That explains the two selfie lens. (one of which has an insane 20-megapixels), which are used to produce bokeh shots, aka "portrait shots," because we know how much millennials love selfies. According to Gionee, the S10 produces the bokeh effect with its own "Hardware Engine Image Processor" and "self-created ISP algorithm," that means the depth-of-field effect you see in photo samples are determined using the phone's actual hardware instead of just an artificial software blur. I didn't have much time with the phone yet but from my test the bokeh shots came out impressive and fast.. This is a sample shot showing off the S10's bokeh effect.. The S10 does produce a more detailed bokeh shot faster than on other phones.. Other specs include a Helio P25 processor with 6GB of RAM. The device has a sleek all-metal build with a 5.5-inch 1080p screen that curves subtly at the edges (aka 2.5D glass). The battery inside is 3,450 mAh, which Gionee says will provide up to 12 hours of video time, 40 hours of talk time and 99 hours of music playing. The device comes in four colors, black, blue, green and gold.. The blue looks quite nice in my opinion.. I have a review unit on me right now, and while I haven't been able to do much with it, the phone feels very premium. The software is of course snappy so far out of the box, but we'll see how that goes as I test it more. I'll have a review up here in about a week or so.. My review unit, looking sleek in matte black.. The matte black won't pick up fingerprints like the glass backs on other phones.. The S10 will go on sale in China on June 9th. for 2,599 yuan and will hit other markets around Asia soon.

Gionee’s no stranger to boundary-breaking smartphone design. Its W2017 features two fast-charging batteries packed into a compact body, and it claims that the M6 and M6 Plus are among the “most secure” phones around. So it’s not exactly surprising that its revamped S Series — the newest to join the company’s growing smartphone portfolio — is no less innovative.. were announced for Chinese markets in May 2017, but could launch in more territories in the coming months. Here’s everything you need to know.. The S10, S10B, S10C may not look especially distinctive — Gioneer’s S-Series aesthetic is something of a cross. between an iPhone 7 and HTC’s U11. But there’s more to the phones’ design than meets the eye.. The S10, S10B, S10C have rounded and chamfered edges, and an oval-shaped fingerprint sensor on the front flanked by two touch-sensitive navigation buttons (a back button on the left, and a shortcut to the list of apps running in the background on the right). Gionee has implemented a unique antenna design that has eliminated the need for plastic seams, and has added protective glass on the S-Series with a “2.5D” shape that curves around the phones’ bodies.. All three phones have hybrid slots that allow either Dual SIM or MicroSD storage expansion.. The S10, the highest-end offering of the S-Series bunch, boasts the most impressive hardware, unsurprisingly.. On the front’s a 5.5-inch 1080p (1,920 x 1,080 pixels). In-Cell display with a MediaTek Helio P25. There’s 64GB of storage onboard, a 3,450mAh battery that delivers 40 hour of call time and 12 hours of video playback.. Two on the front (one 20MP sensor and one 8MP sensor), and two on the rear (one 16MP sensor with a f/1.8 aperture and one 8MP sensor), deliver superior shots in low light. Gionee’s “Hardware Engine image processor” powers the four shooters, and an ISP algorithm generates real-time. The S10B, the midrange S-Series offering,. is a slight step down from the S10.. It has 5.5-inch Full HD display, a MediaTek Helio P10 processor, and 4GB of RAM (as opposed to the S10’s 6GB). There’s 64GB of internal storage, and a 3,700mAh battery.. Software Release date and availability HTC U11 vs. Samsung Galaxy S8: Which flagship reigns supreme? HTC U11 vs. Google Pixel: Can HTC’s latest beat Google’s first phone? With 4,000mAh battery, Energizer Energy E550LTE should keep going and going. The cameras are the most obvious compromise. The S10B has lower-quality dual cameras on the rear — one 13MP and one 5MP — and 1 single 6MP selfie cam. And it lacks the S10’s image-processing hardware.. The S10C, the most affordable in Gionee’s S-Series lineup, has a smaller, 5.2-inch HD screen and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 427 processor coupled with 4GB of RAM. There’s 32GB of storage under the hood, and a 3,100mAh battery.. A single 13MP front sensor and 16MP rear sensor juggle picture-taking duties.. The S-Series ships with Gionee’s Jinli security suite, which protects against fraudulent phone calls, text messages, and phishing websites, and offers quick access to Allipay and WeChat, China’s most popular payment platforms — double-clicking the home button launches the payment service you’ve specified in the Settings menu.. Gionee’s health app records activities like running and walking, and applies machine intelligence to “show more comprehensive health data” and track sleep. And Grabber uses “semantic intelligence” to highlight locations, times, and phone numbers in text messages and websites, supplying a corresponding “smart card” with related info and sharing shortcuts — sort of like Google’s Now on Tap.. The G10 starts at CNY 2,599 (roughly $380). The cheaper S10B retails for CNY 2,199 (roughly $320), and the S10C is. Gionee’s S-Series phones will ship in gold, black, blue, and green when they go on sale in China. The S10C is available now, and the Gionee S10 and S10B launch on June 9..

Mobiles / Gionee Mobile Phones / Gionee S10 Price in India. Market Status: Coming Soon User Visits: 1,392 Launch Date in India: 20 March, 2018 Compare. The Chinese handset maker, Gionee is on a launching spree it seems as it has recently launched A1 and is now all set to launch the M6S Plus on April 24. In the meanwhile, a new device from the brand has surfaced on the Internet, which is touted to be Galaxy S10. This handset happens to be a powerful dual camera smartphone from the brand and will appeal to smartphone photography enthusiasts. Here is a brief overview of the handset for those who might be interested in this one.. Dual rear camera : The brand has equipped the device with a powerful dual camera module on the rear panel. This camera module is a combination of 13-megapixel primary sensor and 5-megapixel secondary sensor along with LED flashlight. We can be rest assured that the device would be able to capture great images.. Front fingerprint scanner : While the images on the internet are showing Gionee logo on the back, this time around the fingerprint scanner is not embedded in the logo. This time around the brand has embedded the scanner in the front into the home button. This is preferred by most users, who are used to having it on the front.. Powerful front camera : It is not only the rear camera on the handset that steals the show, but in true Gionee fashion, the front camera is also pretty impressive. Gionee will be launching this handset with a powerful 16 Megapixels snapper on the front panel. This camera module is more suspected to pull in users instead of the back dual camera module.. No NFC : This is one of the biggest omission that any smartphone could possible have at this point. Most cashless transaction apps and features come designed to be used with the NFC.

Gionee s10 ,gionee s10 leaked specifications Less than six months ago, the dual camera Gionee S9 hit the market. Those who picked it up might be sad to learn that a successor is already on the way. The Gionee S10 was seen getting certified on TENAA. While the upgrades are not a lot, it still hurts to see a phone get refreshed less than a year after launch. The Gionee S10 has the same 5.5-inch FHD display as the S9. The RAM and storage have also been kept at 4GB and 64GB respectively. Where the Gionee S10 begins to differ are in the cameras, battery and software. The dual rear cameras are now both 13MP sensors while the front-facing camera is a 16MP shooter. The rear cameras have been redesigned as they now sit at the left corner and are raised. The battery capacity has also been increased to 3700mAh. The TENAA listing shows that the Gionee S10 runs Android 7.0 Nougat but there is no information if it will be Amigo OS 4.0. The processor wasn’t specified but it is still a 2.0GHz octa-core SoC. gionee s10,gionee s 10,gionee,gionee s9,gionee s9t,gionee s10 review,gionee review,review,unboxing,hands on overview,overview,hindi,2017,india,gionee india,gionee s10 specifications,gionee upcoming phones,gionee upcoming smartphones,gionee a1,gionee dual camera,gionee selfie,selfiestan,selfiestaan,gionee alia bhatt,gionee virat kohli,gionee a1 review,gionee a1 plus,gionee a1 vs moto g5 plus,gionee 2017,gionee mobile,gionee s10 leaked specifications gionee s 103 gionee s10 gionee s 103 pro gionee s106 gionee s105 gionee s107 gionee s10 price gionee s108 gionee s10 price gionee s10 gionee s10 jig gionee s10 for sale gionee s10 manual gionee s10 kit gionee s10 price gionee s10 quilts gionee s10 quilt gionee s10 specs gionee s10 rom gionee s10 unblocked gionee s10 weight gionee s10 xtreme gionee s10 zr2 gionee s10 000 gionee s10 youtube gionee s10 32gb gionee s10 7.3 gionee s10 8i gionee s10 9mm gionee s10 priuce in india diesel gionee s10 priuce in india 2016 gionee s10 priuce in indiana gionee s10 priuce in india bangalore gionee s10 priuce in india bangladesh gionee s10 priuce in india company gionee s10 priuce in india call gionee s10 priuce in india amazon gionee s10 priuce in india arie gionee s10 priuce in india hyderabad gionee s10 priuce in india gsmarena gionee s10 priuce in india ebay gionee s10 priuce in india ever gionee s10 priuce in india flipkart gionee s10 priuce in india january 2016 gionee s10 priuce in india map gionee s10 priuce in india maps gionee s10 priuce in india price gionee s10 priuce in india pakistan gionee s10 priuce in india love gionee s10 priuce in india location gionee s10 priuce in india kerala gionee s10 priuce in india online gionee s10 priuce in india now gionee s10 priuce in india news gionee s10 priuce in india quikr gionee s10 priuce in india quizlet gionee s10 priuce in india review gionee s10 priuce in india rs gionee s10 priuce in india reviews gionee s10 priuce in india univercell gionee s10 priuce in india usa gionee s10 priuce in india vs gionee s10 priuce in india vs australia gionee s10 priuce in india vs pakistan gionee s10 priuce in india vs pakistan gionee s10 priuce in india visa gionee s10 priuce in india today gionee s10 priuce in india time gionee s10 priuce in india to usa gionee s10 priuce in india xbox one gionee s10 priuce in india youtube gionee s10 priuce in india year gionee s10 priuce in india z10 gionee s10 priuce in india zip code gionee s10 priuce in india zone Gionee S10 expected price in India is Rs. 16,900 Subscribe Our Chennel:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6aM...

Gionee announced in China a new line of smartphone that will come in three variants.. This is the Gionee S10, which will come in three different flavors: the S10 itself, the S10B, and the S10C.. The Gionee S10 variants will be situated at different price categories. However, it looks like none of them are meant for the low-end market. The cheapest of them all, the aptly named S10C, is still at CNY1,599 ( around Php11,600). That’s still way expensive than the sub-Php5,000 that most budget-friendly devices we’re accustomed to.. However, it looks like Gionee gave a reasonable pricing for the three. The solely named S10 is the top-of-the-line member of the bunch. The handset boasts four cameras in total, equally divided to have the front and back sport a dual-camera setup. We have seen this initially with the Oukitel U22 , and it looks like the S10 is just the rebranded version. The two looks similar just in the looks itself.. Moreover, the Gionee S10 also brags other high-end features. There’s a large 5.5-inch IPS display with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. A quite substantial 3450mAh which can hopefully last for more than a day.. On the downside, Gionee opted for a MediaTek processor instead of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon. However, what we have here is still one of the best from the Chinese SoC manufacturer. The Gionee S10 is equipped with a 2.5GHz Helio P25 octa-core processor, backed with a generous 6GB of RAM. This thing can probably take pretty much everything you throw at it.. Next stop, we have the more toned-down S10B. This one still has some high-end features, but not as crazy as what the S10 has.. The Gionee S10B doesn’t have four camera sensors on it, but it is still. equipped with a dual-camera setup at the back. It also has a less aggressive 1.8GHz MediaTek Helio P10 octa-core processor, but still decently. There’s also a 4GB RAM to carry multiple applications well.. What hasn’t changed from the S10 to the S10B is the display. This smartphone will have the same 5.5-inch IPS screen. Gionee F5: 5.3-inch HD Display, Octa-core CPU, 4GB RAM, 4000mAh battery. And for the last one, we have the Gionee S10C. This is where Gionee made quite a huge adjustment in the whole line.. Unlike the first two, Gionee sliced. size and resolution on the S10C. We now have a 5.2-inch IPS display with only 720p resolution. Despite the slash, the screen is still respectable. Gionee also completely removed the dual-camera setup on. However, both the cameras found at the front and back still. Gionee M2017: Snapdragon 653 processor, 6GB RAM, dual cameras and massive 7000mAh battery. One surprising move Gionee did is the move from a MediaTek chip to a Qualcomm Snapdragon. However, what the S10C has is a 1.4GHz Snapdragon 427 quad-core processor, an evidently weaker processor than the first two.. The new Gionee S10 smartphones will be available in China starting June 9. We still have to wait for Gionee Philippines’ official word regarding of its official price and availability in the country..
