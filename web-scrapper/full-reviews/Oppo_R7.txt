And The Elegance Of A Violin. The body of the R7 was designed with a single piece of aircraft-grade magnesium aluminium alloy and has undergone 48 polishing processes before finally attaining it’s exquisite all-metallic body. Its metallic ratio is as high as 92.3%. The robust device is matched with a 5 inch 1080p Super AMOLED screen, and the craftsmanship and beauty of a violin.. OPPO has initiated the concept of "Free Curves" and redefined the curves of the screen. The precision craftsmanship creates a glass screen that is solid yet gentle, while the metallic body provides incredible protection when dropped.. The design of the R7 body delicately employs the artistic style of "lineism". The back adopts the classic arc design of a violin's neck to match the double-arcs of the body's edges, creating the visual effect of slimness and highlighting the perfection in details through the movement of light and shadows.. 5 minutes of charging supports 2 hours of talk time. With five layers of protection and low-voltage rapid charging, mobile power packs are no longer needed. Unless it's our VOOC Power Bank of course.. For photo-taking, the R7 utilizes phase detection autofocus (PDAF) and smart anti-shake optimization. The best image is formed instantaneously using multi-modal sensitive computations, capturing perfect images with incredible image quality even when taken quickly.. 3GB of RAM matched with an amazing 8-core processor. Say goodbye to tedious loading and hello to faster and smoother games and programs.. The Choice is Yours With Dual SIM.

Forget about missing important notifications with automatic lock screen notifications !. We realize that users prefer mobile phones with a clear aesthetic and an outstanding feel.. OPPO has created a comfortable large-screen smartphone that beautifully satisfies the difficult balance of ergonomics and visual sleekness. The R7 is born.. The chief designer of the R7 started learning the violin from a very young age and found that the arcs of a violin's neck are perfectly suited to fit the hand. Thus, the R7 forms a quintessential link between tradition and modernity.. The R7 inherits OPPO's classic “Lineism” design philosophy, with free-flowing curves conveying elegance, tenderness, and aesthetic sleekness, whilst providing users with a sense of security and ease. The R7 employs a unibody craftsmanship and is the result of 48 polishing processes. While aiming at a hardy and metallic appearance, the use of multiple arcs at the angular joints gives the handset a dynamic look that flows with lights and colors, no matter the angle from which it is seen.. The back has undergone refined polishing, with the protrusion of each grain on the surface being only 0.03 micrometers. The fine and delicate smoothening with zircon and sand blasting creates a back that is soft to the touch, with a velvet-like softness despite being metallic.. The front of the R7 is installed with a jaw-dropping, AMOLED glass screen for better image quality. The 2.5D arc surface (droplet screen) does not have any hard angles along the front edges. The edges of the screen are gentle, yet compact and safe, endowing the phone with gorgeous charm.. The Flexibility Of Light And Shadow. The R7 cleverly combines light and curves to create the visual illusion of a slimmer appearance. An arc and a Bezier curve are added to the sides of the body, resulting in a unique T-shaped tooled-outlateral arc that is filled with light. This is an exceptional technique combining light and shadow, creating extraordinary visual charm.. Every OPPO device is born with photography deep within it’s DNA. It picks out every detail of the photograph in depth. Perfect image quality, brand-new Beautify 3.0, and ultra-clear flash shot help you capture every moment of beauty.. The Pure Image 2.0+ engine of the camera has been fully upgraded. Multi-frame sampling empowers the R7 with Ultra HD 50 megapixel shots to capture even more details..

CNET también está disponible en español.. Oppo's R7 charms with a sleek metal build, but the price isn't right. The Good The Oppo R7 packs premium design into a slim, luxurious metal package. It also features Oppo's patented fast charging and you can easily get hold of it in major western markets.. The Bad The phone is expensive for its midrange hardware, and its battery life isn't that good.. The Bottom Line Oppo's R7 looks great, but the $400 price tag will push potential buyers away. There are cheaper phones out there that are just as good, and better ones don't cost much more.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Design and build 5-inch display with 1,920x1,080-pixel resolution 5.6 by 2.8 by 0.2 inches (143 by 71 by 6.3mm) 5.2 ounces (147 grams) Comes in gold or silver The Oppo R7 sports a magnesium-aluminum rear. Touch-sensitive keys take up space at the bottom. Hardware 1.5GHz octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor from Qualcomm 16GB of storage (expandable memory of up to 128GB) 3GB of RAM 2,320mAh embedded battery The Oppo R7 has a good-looking design and packs midrange hardware. Software and apps Google Android 4.4.4 KitKat OS Gesture features that allow quick access to the phone Customizable themes The Oppo R7 UI doesn't deviate too much from Android, though like many Chinese-based ROMs, there's no app drawer. The pull-down notification menu is similar to that of other Android phones, and you have quick access to control buttons. You can also enable gesture controls that give you quick access to the camera and music playback. Camera and video 13-megapixel (bottom) rear-facing camera 8-megapixel front-facing camera Full-HD video recording at 30 frames per second (rear) Auto-focus, LED flash. Oppo's R7 -- the successor to the superslim Oppo R5 -- is a beautiful phone. It's kept the R5's metal look, but it's larger, slightly thicker and feels a lot more polished. And where the R5 had performance issues, the R7 runs smooth as butter. The camera app launches quickly too, resolving one of the biggest problems with its predecessor.. However, the price of the R7 will be a sticking point. It retails on the Chinese manufacturer's online store for $400/AU$449 (this converts to about £260), which is expensive for a phone with midrange specs. If you're willing to spend slightly more, flagship phones such as ZTE's Axon Pro are available, while cheaper phones such as the One Plus 2 or the Xiaomi Mi Note offer similar designs.. The Oppo R7 is a looker. While the phone bears a passing resemblance to Samsung's new Galaxy range, Oppo has made the R7 its own. The metal band around the sides accents the look, and it's just wide enough to contain the audio jack and Micro-USB ports. That said, unlike phones with a smoother edge, it isn't comfortable to grip. The slightly annoying feeling of a metal edge digging into your palm doesn't make for the most pleasant of holds.. The R7's 5-inch AMOLED display has a full-HD 1,920x1,080-pixel resolution. The rear is an aluminum-magnesium alloy, and the metal gives it a smooth, luxurious feel. The 13-megapixel camera is located at the top left.. Oppo typically features physical touch-sensitive menu keys, and the R7 is no different. The power button is found on the left side and the volume rockers are on the right. If you're worried the buttons are too small for its 6.3mm frame, fret not -- you'll have no issues here. In fact, I quite like the clickiness of the keys. That said, the power button placement can be a bit annoying as you'll sometimes hit it when picking up the phone or taking pictures in landscape mode.. Lastly, you'll find the dual-SIM 4G slots located above the volume keys. The microSD SIM slot also doubles up as a microSD card slot with support for 128GB of external storage.. The Oppo R7 is a midrange phone, so it's no surprise that the specs aren't as impressive as flagship phones. It's powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor, which, based on previous experience with similar devices, is capable of offering a smooth performance. You'll be able to run games and other resource-intensive apps just fine, but don't expect anything too impressive.. Other specs include 16GB of storage, 3GB of RAM and 13-megapixel rear and 8-megapixel front cameras. While the 2,320mAh battery is small, the phone features fast-charging technology. Oppo claims you can charge to 75 percent in a mere 30 minutes, and in testing it came close -- I was able to hit 72 percent in the stipulated time.. If you need 4G support, there are three different versions of the phone. The international version should work on LTE networks such as Three and EE. In Australia, the R7 is an Optus exclusive if you're buying from a carrier, but the unlocked version from the Oppo website will work on other networks such as Telstra. In the US, it can get 4G on both T-Mobile and AT&T.. While the Oppo R7 runs on the older KitKat version of Android, the phone uses Oppo's Android-based Color OS. So I'm not faulting this phone for running KitKat, since you won't see much stock Android on it.. Oppo's customized launcher comes packed with signature Oppo features including gesture control. For example, you can activate the camera by drawing an O, or you can turn the music on by swiping two fingers downwards while the screen is off. When the screen is on, you can pinch close with multiple fingers to turn on the camera, or slide three fingers up and down to take a screenshot.. The phone has a range of themes and gives you the option to change the visual effect for opening, closing and switching apps. Oppo has also included backup features and an O-Cloud sync for your contacts and messages, though this only seems to be compatible with other Oppo phones. If you're wondering where the app drawer is, it's not there. Like iOS, Color OS puts the apps right on the phone's home screen. That said, features such as control buttons -- to let you change your Wi-Fi and data settings, put the phone into airplane mode and so on -- are handily located on the notification pull-down menu.. On many large screen smartphones, the user interface isn't always optimized for the larger display, and some icons can appear too large and look awkward. It's definitely a pet peeve of mine. The R7's screen, however, isn't big enough that this would be a problem, and the icons appear to fit the screen well.. The R7's camera app has a pretty simple layout. There's a big shutter button at the bottom, and when holding the phone in a landscape position, you can filter your photos by tapping the button at the top-left corner. Doing this will give you access to a bunch of filters and features, such as Ultra HD (which stitches multiple pictures into one for a larger image) and other standard modes such as panorama and HDR. There's a cool GIF animation creator, which lets you shoot a movable image like a video, but without sound. You can also reverse the motion of the capture to spice things up.. Best Phones for 2018.

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

Pros: o aparelho é bonito de uma construção sólida as primeiras impressões foram muito satisfatória. veio com uma capinha e película já instalada Cons: O aparelho veio com defeito não liga apenas aparece o ícone da bateria, é uma situação bastante desagradável, esperar tanto pra receber o celular e quando chega vem com defeito, eu acho que não é culpa da gearbest porém é muito desagradável e agora se eu quiser ter algum lucro tenho que mandar de volta pra China pra não ficar no prejuízo kkkkk.

Yes ( 0 ) No ( 0 ). Pros: Overall it is BEST smartphone in today's market! The detailed reasons: Needless to say the price is unbeatable for comparable quality phones; The ease of use: very very, set up is easy, surfing the various functions and the internet are fast in speed comparable or even faster often than my i7 PC; Building quality: personally unseen so far; I can not even figure out how to open the back cover. In fact it is no need as the SIM/SM cards are in the right side pin-keyed double slots. The most impressive is the aesthetic beauty, not mentioning the 6.3 mm thickness. It comes with a clear plastic case, a big plus! The screen has a protective clear film, almost invisible if not to search for carefully, so that the screen can not be easily damaged. Usefulness: the 13 MP back and 8 MP front cameras are truly enjoyable. The vibrant, bright colors become a minor plus by comparison! And, not mentioning the rapid recharging feature. Overall, simply the best phone! The 1st was for my son. The 2nd order is for me, coming today any minute - just can't wait ! Cons: None. wait, perhaps I should say the post-order events are a bit sluggish for about a week during which no update at all-silent. Then thereafter, the shipping events move in a rapid fashion. From the time the phone is picked up by DHL it takes ~60 hours to move rapidly through ALL the processing, custom check and final delivery. So during the 1st 6 days you may be 'unnerved' by the absolute absence of processing updates wondering whether something go wrong. Then you are blistered with the rapid pace until you have it in your hands in a matter of 2.5 days (from Singapore to USA).. Is this helpful? Yes ( 0 ) No ( 0 ). Pros: - is looking nice - thin - fast charging - good camera - menu is simple and you haven't useless application Cons: - sometimes is overheating but only on intense use. - is coming with uk plug and you need adaptor for european plug..

Android 5.1 Lollipop, Color OS 2.1. OPPO has made official two new midrange of devices. The OPPO R7 and the R7 Plus. These two succeeds the R5 which used to hold the title of world’s thinnest smartphone. And here are the specs of each for now.. The R7 also features VOOC which fast charging that gives 75% power in 30 minutes. And the R7 body is only 6.3mm thin.. It also comes with a fingerprint sensor.. R7 from Oppo is a smartphone that is class apart. Dual SIM slots both for Nano or Micro SIM cards. An Android v4.4.2 (KitKat) operating system. Android based exclusive Color OS 2.1 from Oppo that enhances functionality of the phone and usability and organization of apps. The relentless pursuit of Oppo, a China based electronic device make that later expanded its business into smartphones; to meet highest quality standards makes it a prominent smartphone maker in Philippines. Although introduced to this Pinoy market just a few years back, they have successfully proven themselves as capable rivals of strong competitors.. Their hard work and persuasion in providing latest technology, features and facilities to their users, is clearly visible through each one of their designs and sets. It is not just the internal features, but also the aesthetic beauty of these sets that consumers have adored.. One of their series of smartphones that have successfully managed to bring a number of smartphones with great designs is their R series. Amongst its high end models, the Oppo R7 is indeed a treat to eyes as well as a comforting experience for the user.. The R7 model from Oppo has an AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with 16M colours. The 5 inch long screen with 1080 x 1920 pixel resolution ensures a great display. However, it is its 143 x 71 x 6.3 mm dimension that makes sure that the screen size is in perfect compatibility with the body. Oppo smartphone makers always target and aim at catering to the requirement of their consumers, and all of their models and their designs as well as configurations are inspired by their needs. Unlike many other high end sets that do not offer exclusive features like face detection, Oppo R7 detects its owner and lets access to its use.. A 13 megapixel primary camera and an 8 MP secondary camera, along with a Panorama feature, is a perfect combination for great images. Selfies as well as videos can be of high quality. Each and every image as well as video would be of HD quality and they are a treat to the eyes to watch on the screen of this set.. With an Oppo R7, connectivity is not a problem. With internal basic features like Bluetooth connectivity, Wi-Fi or WLAN connectivity, the GPS or geo-tagging feature helps the user to locate himself or herself and stay connected. Stuffed with so many features, the battery needs to be strong and a Non-removable Li-Po 2320 mAh battery that gets charged fast, offers an uninterrupted experience of using this phone..

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Compelling specs, uber-premium design and numerous enhancements make the Oppo R7 one of the most desirable mid-range smartphones on the market.. Color OS won't appeal to everyone. Oppo isn't a household name in the west, but that probably won't be the case for much longer. Ever since the firm's inception just over a decade ago, the Chinese manufacturer has been renowned for producing high-quality, affordable consumer electronics.. Originally specialising in MP3 and DVD players, Oppo recently moved into the smartphone sector, and has enjoyed booming success in mainland China.. Groundbreaking devices such as the Find 5, N1 and R5 have propelled Oppo into the global spotlight, and like many other Chinese smartphone manufacturers the brand is also beginning to gain traction in international markets.. Rather than being something totally unorthodox, the newly released Oppo R7 is more of a refined sequel to the paper-thin R5 – and isn't to be confused with the phablet variant of the R7, the R7 Plus , which was also launched during Oppo's 10th birthday celebrations in May.. Unlike many other Chinese smartphones, the SIM-free R7 attracts no international price markup.. Although most official stores and other partner retailers are located in Asia, you can pick up a SIM-free R7 online. Oppo sells directly via both Amazon and Oppostyle , and the R7 is currently available for just £250 (around $400, AU$515).. While ultimately not as powerful as beefier rivals such as the OnePlus One and Honor 6 , and despite the fact that it's missing the fingerprint scanner from the R7 Plus, the Oppo R7 still packs some impressive specs.. Oppo has included a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 Octa-core processor, an Adreno 405 GPU and a hefty 3GB of RAM – 1GB more than the R5. The front-facing shooter has received a resolution bump to 8MP, and the rear 13MP unit now derives from Samsung, rather than Sony.. 'VOOC Flash Charge' technology is once again on board, enabling the R7's relatively small 2320mAh battery to charged to 75% in just half an hour. Unfortunately there's still no NFC , but Oppo has included dual-SIM 4G LTE connectivity.. Akin to the Samsung Galaxy A3, the Oppo R7's all-metal design is what sets it apart from other mid-range offerings. In terms of look and feel the R7 really does surpass all expectations for an affordable smartphone, and almost everything seems more refined than on the R5.. The capacitive navigation keys aren't backlit, but they do free up space on the R7's screen.. At first glance the front of the Oppo R7 looks extremely similar to the R5, partly thanks to the retention of Oppo's physical navigation keys below the display.. Up top things look a little less lopsided, with the improved 8MP front-facing snapper moving to the left of the central earpiece while the proximity and ambient light sensors remain on the right.. Hidden beneath the front glass is an LED notification light that's only visible when illuminated. Unfortunately, as on the Moto G (2014) it's of the white variety, so you won't be able to differentiate between notification types without firing up the display.. The bottom edge looks almost identical to that of its predecessor, with two antenna bands flanking the centrally positioned microUSB port and single microphone.. Outdoor screen viewability is great, even in the brightest of conditions.. Gazing at the Oppo R7's Full HD screen is a real pleasure, it's one of the best examples on an affordable handset.. A high pixel density of 445ppi makes for crisp-looking text and images, and the inclusion of AMOLED display technology is very welcome. Vivid colours and wide viewing angles combine with an extensive brightness range to create a stellar viewing experience, regardless of lighting conditions.. This impressive screen also features Oppo's '2.5D Arc Edge' design, whereby the glass gently tapers off at the edges, resulting in a pleasant-looking droplet effect. Unfortunately the R7's metal frame interrupts the flowing glass at the very edge, preventing you from fully appreciate the innovative design.. With a thickness of 6.3mm the R7 is chubbier than the R5, but it's lighter, weighing just 147g.. Unusually, the metallic power button is located on the left-hand side. While that may sound problematic, the key is easily accessible with your middle finger if you're right-handed and lefties will find the key perfectly positioned for their thumb. You can double-tap the screen to wake the phone, or the home button to sleep it if you prefer, although you will miss out on the great tactile feedback.. Like the power key, the volume rocker on the right edge feels very premium. That said, being right-handed I often found myself hitting the volume keys with my thumb by accident when gripping the R7.. Oppo has implemented a nifty 4G dual-SIM and microSD setup in order to keep the sides of the R7 clean. The tray located above the volume rocker can hold one microSIM and nanoSIM, although if you wish to expand the 16GB of internal storage by up to a further 128GB you'll have to swap out the nanoSIM for a microSD card.. Sacrificing storage for a second SIM isn't ideal, but it's a sacrifice that was necessary in order to retain the R7's slender profile and minimal look.. Last year's R5 was compromised in multiple ways, and the omission of a 3.5mm headphone jack was arguably the most notable example. Thankfully you won't need to use a pesky microUSB-to-headphone adapter with the R7, as Oppo has managed to cram a 3.5mm jack into the slightly thicker frame.. Another antenna band is present up top, alongside the headphone socket.. Despite the Oppo R7 featuring a modest 5-inch screen, the inclusion of physical navigation buttons at the bottom results in a rather tall device. A degree of dexterousness may be needed to reach the top corners of the display, although the well-positioned buttons help to minimise in-hand shuffling.. For such an affordable offering the full metal unibody construction of the Oppo R7 is incredible, exhibiting absolutely no signs of creaking or flexing. The quality of the fit and finish is right up there with flagships such as the iPhone 6 and HTC One M9 , which cost almost twice as much.. Machined speaker holes are present at the base of the R7's rear.. The smooth metal rear is subtly stylish and pleasantly cool to the touch. At the top-left there's a 13MP rear snapper, which thankfully protrudes far less than the unit found on the R5. Underneath sits the single LED flash, with the noise-cancelling microphone taking up a slightly off-centre position above the Oppo logo.. Both the silver and gold variants of Oppo R7 adopt a matte finish around back, which does a good job of resisting fingerprints. In stark contrast to many metal smartphones the rounded-off corners on the back don't dig into the palm, and the chamfered metal frame provides plenty of grip.. Arguably the Oppo R7's standout feature is its design. As discussed in the first section of this review, the build quality is superb and it feels lovely in the hand.. Oppo also touts the prowess of both the main 13MP camera and 8MP front-facing shooter, which I'll look at more closesly in the camera section of the review.. While more and more manufacturers have been adopting Qualcomm's 'Quick Charge' technology, Oppo has been busy perfecting its own alternative: 'VOOC Flash Charge', which was first introduced with the Find 7 and is designed to provide a safe and fast charging experience.. At present VOOC charging is only available on Oppo's own handsets.. The Oppo R7 is the latest device to support this technology, with the Chinese firm claiming that five minutes on the supplied rapid charger will give you enough juice for a two-hour phone call, and that charging the battery from 0 to 75% can be achieved in just half an hour. In practice I was consistently able to reach over 70% within the allotted time, a quite remarkable feat.. Being a Chinese smartphone, it's not surprising that the R7 includes dual-SIM functionality. Only a handful of devices designed in the west, such as the Moto G (2014) , support this feature. Yet in Asia and other developing markets this feature has been available for some time, even on the cheapest of handsets.. Dual-SIM options are clearly displayed throughout Color OS 2.1.. I can see why the feature is so highly sought-after in certain parts of the world. It's extremely convenient if you normally have to carry around separate work and personal phones, while regular international travellers and business people will also appreciate not having to swap SIM cards every few days.. 2G, 3G and 4G LTE are usable on both SIM cards, which will certainly appeal to heavy data users, although when you select one SIM to use either 3G or 4G LTE, the other is automatically limited to just 2G.. US and international versions of the R7 are available, so users residing in the States and Australia shouldn't have a problem accessing 4G LTE networks. Unfortunately none of the R7 variants support band 20 LTE, so those in the UK who are on O2, giffgaff or Tesco Mobile won't be able to receive any 4G signal.. Color OS 2.1, Oppo's customised version of Android, is preinstalled on the R7. For some reason the Chinese firm decided to release the newer Android Lollipop-based software exclusively for the larger R7 Plus , leaving the R7 stuck on 4.4.4 KitKat.. However, on the face of it there seems to be very little difference between the two software versions, and I'm hopeful that the R7 will receive the Android 5.1 update in the near future.. With little bloatware to bog you down, maneuvering through Color OS 2.1 is a simple affair.. The latest Color OS 2.1 upgrade brings improved aesthetics and a host of new features.. In general the icons and menus exhibit a flatter, more refined look than before. Stock widgets, such as the clock, now appear slightly transparent, and the music space to the left of the central homescreen has also received a facelift.. Likewise, all of the R7's key apps are very similar to what was present on the R5 , but have been slightly tweaked to be more visually coherent.. As is the case with the majority of Chinese custom UIs, Color OS 2.1 still doesn't feature an app drawer. For first-time smartphone users and those switching from an iPhone, this omission arguably makes navigating around the OS a little simpler.. Android veterans on the other hand will probably dislike the multitude of app icons and folders taking up precious widget space on the R7's homescreens.. One folder that will be a welcome sight is the one containing key Google apps like Gmail, Chrome and Maps. Other than the variants sold domestically in China, all R7s are shipped with the Play Store and Google Services preinstalled.. From previous experience of owning imported Chinese smartphones, I know how much of a chore it can be to get these installed and running smoothly. So being able to use them straight out of the box is a real blessing.. As Oppo's global presence grows, higher quality themes will become available in the international Theme Store.. Despite many lacking Google apps, devices from China do tend to offer a multitude of customisation options.. A Theme Store app is present on the international Oppo R7, but it's a watered-down version of the one found on the Chinese variant. There are fewer themes available, and the ones that are included aren't as polished.. That being said, the themes are far from the worst I've seen, and the app still enables you to change the look of the icons, folders, lockscreen and wallpaper.. Hopefully the 'Mash Up' feature from the Chinese Theme Store will soon be rolled out globally, as currently you can't combine elements from different themes.. In spite of the lack of aesthetic customisation options, Oppo hasn't tried to compensate by adding tons of gimmicky software features. In fact, in the gesture and motion department the Chinese firm have removed the finicky air gestures, opting to focus its attention on 'Screen off' and 'Screen on' gestures.. A number of customisable letter-based gestures are available when the R7's in sleep mode. These enable you to either jump straight into an app of your choice, or control your music while the screen is off.. The much-loved double-tap to wake feature is also here and, instead of having to reach for the power key, a quick double-tap of the home key will sleep the R7's display.. Luckily for those who find accessing some areas of the R7's screen a bit of a challenge, a handy 'Mini-screen' mode can be activated via a simple gesture. Swiping into the centre of the display from either of the bottom corners shrinks whatever's on the screen, and pulls it closer to your preferred hand.. Next Page Performance and essentials.

Nagy April 21, 2015 1:53 am. Update: Meanwhile the images below have popped up on Mobile-Dad purportedly showing off the device which is expected to be even thinner than the R5’s 4.8mm profile (and without the protruding camera), while maintaining a metal build. Remember the OPPO R7? It will, at one point (whenever it gets released), become the R5’s follow-up, and one of its main features is the fact that is has a (nearly) bezel-less (on the sides) outer aspect. We looked at the OPPO R7 in some leaked images at the end of last month, but now we’re being treated to a video showing off the phone.. As it turns out the OPPO R7 is not bezel-less. As thin as the frame might be on the side, there are bezels indeed, but OPPO has found a clever way to mask them, and give the phone. A curved glass reflects (or refracts) the light on the sides in such way so that you’d think the screen goes all the way to the sides. It doesn’t, but the idea is neat. You can check the effect out at the end of this OPPO R7 video below.. In terms of its internals, little to nothing is known about the phone. Some reports suggest that it might feature a 64-bit octa-core. MediaTek MT6795 processor and a 20.7MP main camera.. Source: YouTube Via: GSMArena , PhoneArena. Android , Leaks , News , Oppo , R7.
