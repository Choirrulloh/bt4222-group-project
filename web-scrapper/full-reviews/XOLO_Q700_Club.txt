Xolo has announced an entertainment centric entry level smartphone dubbed Xolo Q700 Club that is priced at Rs 6,999. Despite its luring price tag, the handset flaunts dual front facing speakers and IP55 certification. With these aspects, the Xolo offering makes a good entry level offering and here is a quick review based on its hardware.. The primary camera unit in the Xolo Q700 Club is a 5 MP primary camera that is coupled with LED flash for better low light photography. Along with rear snapper, there is a front facing VGA selfie shooter that that can take care of basic video conferencing. At this pricing, there are many smartphones that arrive with similar aspects making this phone an average one.. The internal storage is 8 GB that makes it standard and this can be extended up to 32 GB using a micro SD card. Almost all the devices launched in this price bracket arrive with similar storage options and hence, we do not have any issues with the Xolo phone in this regard.. The chipset used is a quad core MediaTek MT6582M SoC ticking at 1.3 GHz clock speed. This processor is paired with a moderate 1 GB of RAM and these should suffice in rendering decent performance and multi-tasking experience. Moreover, many smartphones in this price bracket arrive with similar hardware aspects.. Battery capacity of the Xolo Q700 Club is 2,000 mAh and it is claimed to pump in 9 hours of talk time and up to 550 hours of standby time respectively on 3G. This makes the battery pretty standard and decent of the pricing the smartphone asks.. Xolo has given the smartphone a 4.5 inch IPS display that carries a FWVGA resolution of 854×480 pixels. It appears like this display is average with a usable pixel density of 218 pixels per inch that should be adequate enough for the usual functionalities.. The device runs on Android 4.4.2 KitKat operating system and is packed with the usual set of connectivity options such as 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and dual SIM functionality. As mentioned above, there dual front facing speakers with DTS support will render an outstanding music experience and the IP55 certification provides it dust and water resistance. It also comes preloaded with Hungama Music app and three months of free subscription to enjoy unlimited music and video downloads.. Analyzing the pricing of the smartphone, it is clear that the Xolo Q700 Club would fall into a rivalry with the other best sellers in the segment including Asus Zenfone 4.5 , Xiaomi Redmi 1S , Huawei Honor Holly and others.. The Xolo Q700 Club is definitely priced appropriately for the specifications and features it arrives with. The handset brings water and dust resistance to the entry level smartphone segment in country with its IP55 certification despite the pricing it carries. This aspect makes the handset stand up against the competition that is faces from the other popular brands that are selling well in this segment..
