As was the case with the older F1, Oppo markets the F1s as "The Selfie Expert", and looking at the specs of the secondary camera on the front, it's easy to see why: the Oppo F1s integrates a 16MP selfie camera with a 1/3.1-inch sensor and an aperture of f/2.0. Selfie camera aside, the Oppo F1s specs are mid-range ones. The display, for one, is a 5.5-inch panel running at a rather modest resolution of 720 by 1280 pixels. The chipset of choice, the Mediatek MT6750 chipset, is another mid-range component, integrating a 1.5GHz octa-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU. In the memory department, the Oppo F1s comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of integrated storage space. Other specs include a fingerprint reader embedded in the physical home button, dual-SIM and microSD compatibility via a triple-slot tray, as well as Android 5.1 Lollipop overlaid with Oppo's own Color OS 3.0.. OS: Android (6.0, 5.1), OPPO ColorOS UI. Dimensions: 6.08 x 2.99 x 0.29 inches (154.5 x 76 x 7.38 mm). Weight: 5.64 oz (160 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 4), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed.

As was the case with the older F1, Oppo markets the F1s as "The Selfie Expert", and looking at the specs of the secondary camera on the front, it's easy to see why: the Oppo F1s integrates a 16MP selfie camera with a 1/3.1-inch sensor and an aperture of f/2.0. Selfie camera aside, the Oppo F1s specs are mid-range ones. The display, for one, is a 5.5-inch panel running at a rather modest resolution of 720 by 1280 pixels. The chipset of choice, the Mediatek MT6750 chipset, is a ... nother mid-range component, integrating a 1.5GHz octa-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU. In the memory department, the Oppo F1s comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of integrated storage space. Other specs include a fingerprint reader embedded in the physical home button, dual-SIM and microSD compatibility via a triple-slot tray, as well as Android 5.1 Lollipop overlaid with Oppo's own Color OS 3.0..

OPPO F1s review: Great hardware, inexcusably old software. OPPO's latest Android phone looks a lot like its last one. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing.. Following the F1 and the F1 Plus , we now have the F1s from OPPO, completing the trilogy of photography-oriented phones. Where the F1 Plus was a noticeable leap ahead of the F1, the F1s' position is somewhere in the middle. On the face of it, it's hard to tell it apart from the F1 Plus.. Indeed, with both the F1s and Plus on my desk side by side, it's impossible to know which is which except if you're looking at specific things — not necessarily a bad thing, since the F1 Plus is a nice piece of hardware. The new F1s is a little larger, a little less powerful, and is making its debut in India for ₹17,999 ($270).. OPPO (the parent company of OnePlus ) has suddenly become one of the world's top five smartphone vendors, so it's very much a company to follow. The F1s isn't particularly different from its predecessors, which means it has the same good and bad points that we've come across before.. Color OS 3.0 based on Android 5.1. 154.5 x 76 x 7.38 mm. Externally, the F1s looks a whole lot like the F1 Plus, but with subtle differences that give it an aesthetic advantage. The ugly antenna lines from the Plus are gone and what is left is a metal back with only the thinnest of breaks. This is likely due to the addition of plastic cutouts on top and bottom, but either way, it's a more attractive chassis. The camera flash is now to the side of the lens, and while the design tweaks are minimal, what you get is an overall better look.. Round the front you're looking at a 5.5-inch 720p LCD display with a physical home button beneath that doubles as the fingerprint sensor. And once again, OPPO nailed this. The fingerprint scanner on the F1s is crazy fast.. Even at 720p, OPPO did a nice job with the display. As usual OPPO did a nice job on the display as well. 720p isn't the highest resolution for this size, but it looks really good. It's visible in fairly bright sunlight and has the eye-protecting blue light filter mode built in that I'm now so attached to. OPPO went away from the AMOLED in the F1 Plus, no doubts to bring the price down a little, but it's still great to look at, even side-by-side with the Plus. Colors are noticeably different to the AMOLED, but whites have a cooler tint, which I personally prefer.. What will split opinions is that the F1s comes pre-dressed with a factory fitted screen protector. Love it or hate it, it's there. It's also there to peel off if such things disgust you. Oh, and while the back of the F1s is metal, the sides are plastic simply painted to match. But as with the F1 Plus, the F1s is sleek, slim and generally a pretty good looking product.. You still get microSD support from OPPO, which will please folks who like that sort of thing, but you also get a decent amount of internal storage. Not as much as on the F1 Plus's 64GB, but 32GB is a great starting point that I wish more companies used.. Hardware isn't really OPPO's problem, and this latest "Selfie Expert" phone isn't breaking from that form. Where we usually find fault is when you turn it on and see the mess that is Color OS. Most disappointing is that OPPO has been teasing the stock-ish looking Project Spectrum for what seems like an eternity, but Color OS still prevails.. OPPO simply has to get off Android Lollipop in a hurry. The issue isn't even what it looks like anymore, nor, thankfully, its overall performance. Color OS used to be pretty appalling in both areas but with version 3.0 big changes were made. There's a much flatter, brighter appearance nowadays and it's super smooth and snappy to use. But it's still based on Android 5.1 Lollipop , and with Android 7.0 on the horizon that's simply unacceptable.. In China, the version of Android might not be an issue. But even though the F1s isn't slated for a North American or European launch, it will be sold in markets where people do care about this stuff. OPPO is now one of the big boys, and it absolutely has to up its software game.. If you want a more in-depth look then check out our review of the F1 Plus , which tells pretty much the same software story. Same good bits, same bad bits. That last one gives us the biggest sad face.. Bouncing back to things that are better to talk about: cameras. You've got the same basic set up on the F1s as on the F1 Plus, in that there's a honking great 16MP front-facing camera on the front and a 13MP shooter on the back. And as always, megapixels don't tell the whole story. You simply take amazing selfies with this thing.. Marketing buzzwords aside, if you're fond of using a front facing camera then the OPPO is worth your attention. It won't make you truly beautiful — much to my dismay — but it'll make your self portraits look sharper than many a phone out there. The camera app is super simple to use and still looks like the one you'd find on an iPhone, but it's the results that really matter.. And while the F1s won't win any best-in-show awards, it has a competent rear camera, too. I took the F1 Plus on a trip to China while reviewing it and was pleasantly surprised at its speed, ease of use and image quality. It's the same story with the F1s, much to my delight.. You'll get a decent day's use out of the F1s, too, with a fairly sizeable 3,075mAh battery squeezed into its svelte frame. OPPO's way of displaying battery usage stats to its users is still a mess, but you're probably OK to ignore it throughout the day, anyway. The VOOC fast charger is also included in the box, offering you the chance of a quick top-up should you need it.. We haven't gone as in depth with the F1s as we might have other phones, because for the most part you could read our F1 Plus review and get the general idea. The F1s is one of OPPO's best phones to date, but the software still drags it down from becoming a truly great phone.. OPPO isn't alone on that front, and heaven knows we've been saying it about other Chinese phone makers for long enough now. What's currently here works just fine in China, but other parts of the world are going to want to see newer versions, the up-to-date security features and regular progress in keeping phones updated. OPPO is doing a lot right, but it needs to get this part nailed.. The F1s also does a lot of things well. It's up for sale in markets such as India and, software aside, is a very nice phone. Hell, even the software it's got is okay — it's just dreadfully out of date. Fix that, and you've got a lot of phone for not a whole lot of money.. Interested? The phone will be available starting August 11 for ₹17,999 from Amazon India as well as brick-and-mortar stores across the country.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Oppo F1s is an upgraded F1 with a 16-megapixel selfie camera. The fingerprint sensor is quick and battery life is also good. The Oppo F1s is priced at Rs. Oppo debuted its camera-centric F-series at the beginning of this year with the launch of the Oppo F1 ( Review ) in India. Shortly after, we got the F1 Plus , which was a more premium model. The company has been marketing this new series aggressively, especially in offline retail channels.. It's been more than six months since the launch of the F1, and to be honest, it feels a bit dated today given how the competition has marched forward. The F1s is a much-needed upgrade, in terms of both design and features, in order to give it a fighting chance. The focus however, continues to be on the front-facing camera. Design and build It would be easy to mistake the F1s for the F1 Plus since they look virtually identical from the front. The mildly curved edges of the display offer a pleasant feeling when you hold this phone, and the slim bezel adds a bit of style. The phone has a pre-installed screen guard which attracts scratches fairly easily, and we think this could have been done away with since there is Gorilla Glass 4 for protection.. The 5.5-inch IPS display produces rich colours, and the maximum brightness level is much better than the Oppo F1 could manage. We had no trouble with the display under direct sunlight. Even though the panel is good, we're not happy about the HD resolution, which is a bit too coarse for a screen of this size. Even though pixellation isn't all that apparent, it would have been nice to have text and icons just a bit sharper, and that isn't asking for too much considering this phone's price point.. The F1s gets a fingerprint sensor, which was missing on the F1, and it works very well. Just like the F1 Plus, the screen unlocks instantly. The sensor is flanked by two backlit capacitive buttons. Oppo also throws in a notification LED near the top. The all-metal body looks really good and the glossy gold trim that runs along the edges of the phone adds to the device's premium aesthetic.. Button placement is ergonomic although we would have liked better spacing between the volume buttons so we could distinguish them better. The headphones socket is on the bottom, along with a Micro-USB port and mono speaker. Once again, the headphones socket would have been better on the top as cable tend to get in the way while you're trying to type.. Around the back, we have the 13-megapixel camera and LED flash. The battery is sealed inside and is non-removable. The SIM tray sits on the right and we appreciate the fact that it's not a hybrid Dual-SIM solution. Along with the two Nano-SIM cutouts, you also get a dedicated microSD card slot which can accommodate a 128GB card.. The package includes a 10W power adapter, data cable, silicon case, SIM ejector tool, headset, and some reading material. Overall, the F1s gets a much-needed cosmetic upgrade, which makes it feel relevant among the competition. The fast fingerprint sensor and dedicated microSD card slot are added bonuses. It doesn't feel too heavy at 160 gram and is fairly slim at 7.3mm.. Specifications and features Oppo has gone with MediaTek's MT6750 octa-core SoC which features eight ARM Cortex-A53 cores running at 1.5GHz. This chip is part of MediaTek's new entry-level lineup with integrated LTE which was announced earlier this year. We got 41,244 points in AnTuTu and 21fps in GFXbench.. Other specifications include 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, USB OTG, GPS, and FM radio. There's no NFC or Wi-Fi ac. The F1s supports 4G LTE on Indian bands along with VoLTE support.. Just like the F1 Plus, the Oppo F1s runs on Colour OS 3.0, which makes Android look somewhat like Apple's iOS. This is fine by us, but what we don't like is that fact that OEMs are still serving up Android Lollipop today, which is now almost two generations old. We might see Marshmallow as an update down the line but it's always nice to have the latest version at launch.. We did find a few kinks in the software that need ironing out. Notifications from some third-party apps, especially Telegram, would intermittently refuse to show up in the notifications shade even though we would hear the alert. Barring this, the interface is quite smooth and relatively lag-free for the most part. The recent apps are displayed as stacked cards, which you swipe up to dismiss.. Oppo has added some tweaks of its own to the settings app. The display submenu gets a blue light filter whose intensity can be varied; Lockscreen Magazine changes the lock-screen wallpaper each time you unlock the phone. You also get a bunch of gestures including one-handed mode, however this didn't work well in our experience.. The phone comes with Google's suite of apps along with others like Theme Store, Kingsoft Office, Security Centre, File Manager, and a video player. O-Cloud is also present, and lets you back up your SMS messages and contacts to Oppo's cloud.. Performance The Oppo F1s is a very good phone to live with and after using it for more than a week, we did not find any glaring problems. It handled most tasks that we threw at it easily, including 3D games, and didn't heat up too much either. There were instances where it got a bit warm but nothing too alarming. 4G connectivity was good and the earpiece was sufficiently loud even during a chaotic commute. There's only the TouchPal keyboard installed, which works well. This is one slippery device, though.. The phone handled HD media files well, including some of our high resolution test files at up to 1080p resolution. Oppo also adds its Dirac software enhancement for the speaker and headphones, which does a fair job at boosting the lower frequencies. The mono speaker gets quite loud for alerts, but the effect isn't that good when watching media.. One of the reasons you'd pick this phone over the more obvious choices is its camera performance. We begin with the front camera, which is the highlight of the phone. You get a 16-megapixel sensor with an f/2.0 aperture that manages pretty detailed selfies in even less-than-ideal lighting conditions. Beautify 4.0 software lets you get rid of any 'blemishes'. You can vary its effect on the final picture or not use it at all.. (Tap for full size Oppo F1s sample image). Like earlier F-series phones, you can take a selfie with a palm gesture or a voice command. Thanks to the brighter display, the screen flash is a lot more effective. However, it's still a bit weak in pitch darkness. The front camera can record 1080p video and there are some additional shooting modes like gif, filters, and double exposure.. (Tap for full size Oppo F1s sample images). The 13-megapixel rear camera also gets the same shooting modes, along with additional ones like Expert mode. The latter lets you control the shutter, ISO, exposure and white balance, and even save in RAW format. We would have liked better controls though, for instance, you can't select a fast shutter speed other than Auto. You only get to choose from 1 second to 16 seconds. Image quality is pretty good for landscapes and macro shots. There is slight artefacting in the dark areas of shots taken in low light, but not too much colour noise, which is good.. The rear sensor gets phase detection autofocus (PDAF) which helps in locking in on your subject better. We like the simplicity of the camera app and the placement of the toggle switches.. Battery life Coming to battery life, we managed to get 10 hours and 11 minutes of continuous video playback from the 3075mAh battery. Under regular use, we found ourselves going a little more than a day before reaching for the charger. However, we wish the F1s had the VOOC fast charging feature that its bigger brother does, as even with the 10W adapter, it takes a painfully ling time to fully charge the phone.. Verdict The F1s is yet another good product from Oppo but we really wish the company had paid a bit more attention to the little details, which could have made it really competitive. We're talking about things like fast charging, Wi-Fi ac and NFC, which probably won't be missed by many but are features we've come to expect in this price range.. The F1s does have a charm of its own and we can see why some would opt for it over the usual suspects. It has a classy design, is built very well, and offers quite a few modern features. The display is also good (although full-HD resolution wouldn't have hurt) and the cameras tend to deliver on their claim.. The launch price is currently this phone's biggest problem. The original F1 has no place in the market anymore, so the most logical thing would have been to swap the F1s in at the same price, which would be the right price segment to be in. 17,990 isn't competitive enough given the phone's specifications, as there more powerful and feature-rich smartphones available for under Rs.

The Oppo F1s is a new phablet with a different take on one of the smartphone industry’s biggest selling points: the camera. This device has a better front-facing camera than its rear one – sounds weird, right? Oppo is calling the F1s a ‘selfie expert’, with software tricks coupled to its front camera aimed at keeping the focus quite literally on you. But should this be your next smartphone? Find out in this Oppo F1s review.. Oppo F1s release date and price. The Oppo F1s was launched at an event in Mumbai, India, on August 3, 2016. It’s priced at $275, but pricing will vary by market. The question of market availability is an interesting one, as the F1s will not be available in major markets like the US and Europe. Oppo has decided to sell it in South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and Australia.. Deciding to launch the device in India is a clear signal that Oppo is targeting markets where there is demand for mid-range phones that have qualities of premium devices like the iPhone 6s Plus, even if it has little more than an echo of premium performance. It’ll be available in gold, rose gold and gray color options.. Oppo F1s design and build quality. The Oppo F1s's design is familiar. We’re dealing with another iPhone-inspired design. Similarities with the iPhone are uncanny. The design of the Oppo F1s will hold your attention only briefly. It might look oddly similar to an iPhone 6s Plus, and that’s because it is. On the front you’ll find a fingerprint sensor which doubles as a clickable home button, front-facing camera and capacitive navigation buttons. On the bottom is a headphone jack, mono speaker grille (although there is a passive secondary grille) and a micro-USB port.. On the right side is a sleep/wake button below the dual-SIM tray, which also has room for a micro-SD card. All three cards can be used simultaneously. To the left side is a volume rocker and on top is a microphone port. On the rear is a 13 MP camera lens, sitting almost completely flush with the metal panel, alongside a flashlight. This flash is surprisingly weak and, while it does the job, is one of the least luminescent smartphone flashes I’ve ever used.. So we’re dealing with another iPhone-inspired design. When I first held the F1s, it felt cheap and hacked together. This initial impression faded the more I used the device. It is, objectively speaking, a mid-range phone and provides no ‘sense of occasion’ while you use it. It’s not premium – but it doesn’t set out to be. While you might not mind, there are small design decisions that suggest build quality was a secondary consideration for Oppo.. The headphone jack, for example, has a small piece of metal missing so that it doesn’t form a whole ring. This is probably due to the port not being symmetrically aligned with the frame (it’s closer to the back edge) and was an engineering tradeoff to avoid structural weakness. Cutting it out was better than leaving it in to possibly bend under force.. The Oppo F1s has a 5.5-inch IPS LCD display, utilizing 2.5D curves around the edges, and is covered in Gorilla Glass 4. But the important thing to note here is resolution. The F1s has an HD display, but it’s only 720 x 1280 pixels. A 720p display, on paper at least, doesn’t look too bad. But we’re well beyond the years when this type of resolution was considered good, and we’re also well beyond a time when 5.5 inch displays are considered huge.. What this leads to is a resolution that’s simply too low for a display of this size. If an attractive display is important to you, with even 1080p not enough for some people, then this could be a thumbs-down moment for you. If you don’t want pixels with your YouTube videos, then buy another phone.. If you don’t want to watch the 1080p videos you recorded with this phone in only 720p resolution, buy another phone. To give context, the last time Samsung used a 720p display in its flagship Galaxy S series was in the Galaxy S3, released in 2012.. Despite its poor resolution, the Oppo F1s display has a cool color mix that is, overall, not bad to use. Unnaturally oversaturated LED displays can get tiring after a while, so if you expect a display to just work without pulling any tricks, the F1s does just that.. The Oppo F1s uses ColorOS 3.0. Running an OS with its roots in 2014 Android is a baffling decision. The Oppo F1s's software, skinned Android 5.1, is very similar to iOS.. Oppo says the F1s runs an “all-new ColorOS 3.0 based on Android 5.1”. In case you missed it, Android 5.1 Lollipop is an operating system from March 2015. So the F1s is running a relatively new skin over the top of an Android version that’s fast becoming outdated. Sure, Android 5.1 is still the second-most used version at the moment, but its peak has passed.. Running an OS with its roots in 2014 Android is a baffling decision. Not only does it bode poorly for the possibility of future software updates – with the release of Android 7.0 Nougat literally only weeks away – it means that buyers of the F1s will be well behind the pack for new features that are already available on phones that were built two years ago and have already received Android 6.0 Marshmallow.. The decision baffles, but this is probably just a way to keep development costs low. With the Oppo Find 7 taking nearly forever to receive Lollipop late last year, Oppo’s poor track record with providing prompt software updates is already well documented. If you want to buy the Oppo F1s, be prepared to be at least one year behind on software updates.. On the surface, ColorOS 3.0 on the F1s is a familiar set of design tropes. When you land on the home screen, you could immediately mistake the clock and Google Now search bar placement for Samsung’s TouchWiz interface.. The similarities with iOS 9 are uncanny. As someone who has used the iPhone for years, the lack of design originality is disappointing. But to someone who has never used an iPhone, and perhaps never will, does it matter? I think, at the very least, potential customers should be aware of how much liberty Oppo has taken in borrowing design ideas from Apple. Other Chinese manufacturers have done the same, such as Huawei.. My question to Oppo is – what’s the point of skinning Android with your own design if that design is heavily borrowed from Apple? If you want to use someone else’s design, just use stock Android.. One of the Basemark X runs. The Oppo F1s is not a powerful phone. It has a 64-bit octa-core MT6750 processor from MediaTek, clocked at 1.5 GHz, and running alongside 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage. Graphics are handled by a Mali-T860 MP2 GPU from ARM.. I ran a series of benchmarks to see how the F1s performed in a controlled environment. Three runs per benchmark were performed to come up with an average. So how did it fare? In Vellamo Metal it. scored 1266, while in Vellamo Multicore it hit 1553. In AnTuTu benchmark it scored 41,565 points, which is quite low indeed. For comparison, this is slightly below how the Lenovo Moto G4 scored in our testing. Geekbench single and multicore performance was 704 and 2938 points, respectively. Finally, on Basemark X medium, it scored 10479, while in high mode it reached 4346 points.. Although it benchmarked relatively poorly, in real-world usage the F1s is up to the task. Benchmarking, after all, proves the extent of hardware performance, yet you won’t need to use the full breadth of it as you switch apps and send text messages.. To push its graphical capabilities, I ran the game Implosion – Never Lose Hope on high settings. Although the display’s resolution held back the game’s graphical quality, I was surprised at the overall smoothness of the gaming experience. The low resolution and processing power also meant that the phone didn’t heat up much. So don’t let the specs sheet put you off – the Oppo F1s still knows how to rumble.. Oppo claims that the fingerprint scanner will unlock the Oppo F1s in 0.22 seconds. In my testing, I found the sensor to be fast and accurate. A new feature that Oppo has included with the F1s is fingerprint-activated calling and app launch. You can assign up to five fingerprints to do this, making the launch of your most-used apps very fast. Unlocking the phone with one of your thumbs is easy to do, however, using your other fingers can be a little awkward as they normally sit behind the phone as you hold it. But other than that, this is a good feature that has a direct benefit to users.. Audio quality is more than decent on the F1s. The Oppo F1s audio experience was pleasantly surprising. The loudspeaker is good for a phone of this price range, getting quite loud but also having decent mid to high-range output. Although it won’t replace a dedicated external speaker, it’s good enough to play your favorite songs as you wash the dishes.. There are preloaded music and radio apps which work well. You’ll probably download a player with its own music streaming library, but the basics are here if you’ve got some music you’d prefer to store locally. Audio quality was good whether with earphones or the loudspeaker.. The music player has an equalizer, which is called ‘Dirac Power Sound’, which has a bunch of different settings to change the sound quality. But I wouldn’t be lulled into the idea that the equalizer improves sound quality – if you really want to improve the audio, leave Dirac and search for a higher quality pair of ear or headphones.. Call quality was surprisingly good as well. The call speaker produces sharp, robust sound and gets quite loud and works well in noisy environments. It’s great to see on a mid-range device of this kind, no forgoing basics like call quality which are all too easy to overlook when focusing on raw performance.. The rear camera is average at best. The front camera is this phone's highlight. I wasn’t sure how much of the photo quality was due to the sensor. See the full test gallery here. Oppo calls the F1s a “Selfie expert”. Although it sounds a bit awkward, the point behind this is that the front-facing camera was intended to be the standout feature of the device. I tested both cameras in a variety of situations to see how they compared. Let’s look at the rear camera to start off.. It has a 13 MP sensor with an aperture of f/2.2, coupled with an LED flash. The first thing you’ll notice when you load up the camera app is how similar it looks to the iOS camera app. But, moving beyond that, the rear camera itself is capable of snapping some decent photos. I found that depth of field was pretty good and I was able to isolate objects easily while taking macro shots.. Burst mode wasn’t too fast and, unless you’ve taken a second to properly focus on your subject, all of the images you’ve burst mightn’t turn out as sharp as you’d like. This is probably just a byproduct of the camera’s slightly sluggish focusing abilities. Other modes like panorama and timelapse worked well, but the latter lapses between frames so quickly that it’s difficult to follow what you’ve shot. There weren't any options to change the frame rate of time-lapse mode, so you’ll have to really focus in on your subject for more than just a few moments to track their movement in a meaningful way.. The camera gets the job done, but I found its low-light performance to be pretty bad. Don’t expect to shoot amazing photos here. It’s a mid-range phone and the main camera, if you can even call it that, offers mid-range quality photos.. This shooter has a 16 MP front sensor with an aperture of f/2.0. If you look closely, you can actually see the slightly larger aperture in comparison to the rear camera. This camera is pretty decent, but I wasn’t sure how much of the photo quality was due to the sensor and how much was due to software processing. I’m all for software tricks that help casual photographers improve the quality of their photos, particularly if they have no intention of editing them, but I’d personally like to take neutral images that I can edit to my preference.. ‘Beautify 4.0’ allows you to increase the level of airbrushed skin you’ve got in selfies. Other manufacturers, such as Huawei, offer this type of software. It looks weird and unnatural, like your skin has the texture of porcelain and candy floss at the same time. Other selfie-focused features include different methods to activate shutter activation via voice or palm activation. If you set the phone down or hold it far from your face, you can hold your palm out to begin a countdown timer.. Overall, both cameras produce good photos but colors can look a little washed out, especially when lighting conditions aren’t ideal. It might have just been better for Oppo to choose a smaller front-facing sensor with better image quality, as the promise of taking expert selfies isn’t really fulfilled on the hardware front. But then again, at the price point, the Oppo F1s camera’s are good – just don’t expect to outdo more expensive phones on the photography front.. Oppo F1s battery life is good, aided by the phone’s lower performance capabilities and display resolution. It has a 3075 mAh battery and will net you around a day to a day-and-a-half of normal usage. While Oppo claims that ColorOS 3.0 has in-built power-saving technology, this phone really should have Android Marshmallow and, with it, Doze mode. I could see battery life extending a little bit further when the update is released.. I ran a battery benchmark in AnTuTu tester. The Oppo F1s scored 6798 points, which is above average when compared to a lot of the other devices we’ve run battery tests on. But benchmarking aside, I found battery life to be better than what you’d expect from a lot of phones nowadays. It lasted for more than a day during regular usage, which is a big plus if you’ve grown tired of all the turbocharged, battery-annihilating flagships out there. This is the plus-side of average specs – better battery life.. 154.5 x 76 x 7.4 mm. 1280 x 720 pixels (267 ppi). While the Oppo F1s is underwhelming in areas like rear camera performance, display quality and raw performance, some drawbacks can be expected for a device in the sub-$300 price bracket. If you’re shopping for a mid-range phone like this, then it shouldn’t come as a surprise that you won’t have cutting-edge hardware.. But what you do get is a good front camera, battery life and affordable price tag. Gaming performance was also quite good, so you can still get a lot for your money here. What I found disappointing, however, is the overt copying of iPhone software and hardware design. Oppo isn’t the first manufacturer to do this, but the lack of originality makes this phone feel cheaper than what it really is.. But if you’re never planning to buy an iPhone 6s Plus, it might make no difference to your purchasing decision. You might want to wait a little to see when Oppo pushes out its big Marshmallow update but, other imperfections aside, the Oppo F1s is a decent. budget phablet worthy of your consideration.. oppo f1s is like an iphone 6 plus but way cheaper & more uswr friendly... iphobe doesn't have external sd card slot & not compatible in most of other devices.... please give me a way how to hack the Oppo F1s so that i can find a way to find who snatch my phone. Well, again a mediocre chinese phone I guess. Huawei started the same way I guess but they made a lot of progress. This Oppo thing is just not interesting for US or Europa, like not at all, no one would really consider buying it when they see it in a shop. So yea kinda does make sense to not sell in those markets, but at some point they have to sell phones here if they want to mature and become a real competitor.. I think Oppo has made a good move to not sell the F1s in the US/Europe. I agree that a lot of people probably wouldn't find it so interesting in those markets, seeing as there are a lot of iPhones floating around already. Who knows, Oppo might have some big plans for the US and Europe, but at the end of the day, there's already plenty of business where they're focusing..

No VOOC fast charging No front-facing flash. Just as a book is easy to judge by its cover, it’s only too easy to judge smartphones by their design and their price. A device that looks like an iPhone with an almost dirt-cheap price tag? Gotta be a cheap knock-off coming from China. That is the stereotype that Chinese OEMs like OPPO face, especially when their smartphones, like the OPPO F1s, do really look like an Apple or even a Samsung flagship. But just like in real life, some things deserve a second, sometimes even third, look. Which is why we gave the OPPO F1s, the new, self-proclaimed “Selfie Expert”, a thorough inspection, and we’re glad we did. Read on to find out why.. It is somewhat strange that OPPO has christened the OPPO F1s as its Selfie Expert when the smartphone sits somewhat in between the previous Selfie Expert, the OPPO F1, and a more premium OPPO F1 Plus. At least in terms of specs. The OPPO F1s is pretty much a mid-range smartphone that sits just a wee bit below most 2016 flagships in terms of specs. Here’s a quick rundown of that, highlighting the smartphone’s key features:. Operating System: Android 5.1, ColorOS 3.0. CPU: MediaTek Helio P10 MT6750, 64-bit octa-core 1.5 GHz. Storage: 32 GB, microSD up to 256 GB. Display: 5.5-inch 1280×720 267 ppi. Main Camera: 13 MP, f/2.2, 1/3.1-inch, PDAF, LED flash. Secondary Camera: 16 MP, f/2.0, 1/3-inch. The Helio P10 isn’t exactly MediaTek’s highest rated mobile processor, a distinction that belongs to the Helio X series, and even then the OPPO F1s’ processor is clocked slower than the OPPO F1 Plus’ MT6755. That said, as you’ll see later, the smartphone fared quite well for its category. The 3 GB of RAM is similar to the OPPO F1, but the F1s gets double the storage compared to its nominal predecessor at 32 GB. And the OPPO F1 Plus? 4 GB of RAM with 64 GB of storage. And even then you can slot in a microSD card for good measure. Here, the OPPO F1s actually outranks even a Samsung Galaxy Note 7. Whereas most smartphones these days will force you to choose between having two SIM or one SIM and one microSD card, the OPPO F1s’ tray has room for all three!. MediaTek has traditionally been considered, warranted or not, as the “cheaper” alternative to Qualcomm’s more ubiquitous processors. The past years, however, it has been shedding off that image and becoming more aggressive in getting its chips in more high-profile devices. That said, despite being advertised as a flagship smartphone, the OPPO F1’s specs, including its processor, is hardly flagship material. As a mid-range device, the OPPO F1s does well for itself. Based on benchmarks, it lags just slightly behind the Samsung Galaxy S5 and Nexus 6, both 2015 smartphones. The OPPO F1s will probably groan under extreme multi-tasking and resource heavy games, but it will handle taking lots of selfies and videos, which is what this smartphone is all about anyway.. In regular, everyday usage, the OPPO F1s operates smooth as butter. Part of its snappy feeling is thanks to ColorOS which is surprisingly light, unusual for a Chinese Android UX. Especially when you compare it to something like Samsung’s TouchWiz. Sadly, for a mid 2016 smartphone, the OPPO F1s still runs Android 5.1. And, like other Chinese Android interfaces, it has strong parallels to iOS. Which isn’t exactly surprising considering the smartphone’s overall design.. Let’s get it out of the way. The OPPO F1s looks like an iPhone 6s Plus at first glance, and sadly that will be the only glance and summary judgment most will give it. Never mind it has a more oblong home button. Never mind that it doesn’t have atrocious antenna lines. It’s clear white face, rounded edges, and Gold and Rose Gold metal backs will undoubtedly make many call it an iPhone wannabe.. While that might be a badge of shame that most would love to pin on these smartphones, they do overlook an effect of the design: the OPPO F1s looks good. It looks premium, which isn’t exactly a common occurrence among mid-range smartphones. The numbers are growing, however, which bodes well for the future of mid tier smartphones overall.. The one rather disappointing aspect of the OPPO F1s is its battery. Not that the 3,075 mAh isn’t enough. Indeed, we got nearly 9 hours of use in a single charge. And that’s with rather heavy use. Of course, if you’re going to take selfies all day long, mixed with the rear camera, you’re bound to run empty sooner. And when you do need to reach out for a charge, that’s when a missing feature will hit you hard. The OPPO F1s doesn’t have the company’s much touted VOOC fast charging capabilities, which means charging that rather large pack is going to take a while. This is one of the ways that the OPPO F1 Plus, with near identical specs, trumps the Selfie Expert, as it has that VOOC technology available to its admittedly smaller 2,850 mAh battery.. Now that we’ve got the basics out of the way, we can focus on some of the ways that the OPPO F1s truly shattered our prejudices, let alone our expectations. And we start with the screen. On paper, it definitely doesn’t look all too exciting. 5.5 inches and 1280×720 pixels? That is, of course, a recipe for a mediocre experience. The OPPO F1s screen was surprisingly bright, crisp, and sharp. And while it technically is HD only, through some trickery or magic, it doesn’t look or feel that way. Yes, you are going to get some scaling when you try to view 1080p content, but in almost all cases, it does extremely well. Colors are vibrant and viewing angles are impressive. And for an LCD screen, that’s quite a feat.. The fingerprint scanner is also one of the pleasant surprises of the OPPO F1s. Truth be told, this is actually the defining feature that distinguishes it from the OPPO F1 and the OPPO F1 Plus, not the selfie camera that it shares with the F1 Plus. The OPPO F1 didn’t even have a fingerprint sensor and, while the F1 Plus does have one, the F1s’ sensor is actually more capable.. For one, it is extremely fast. Just 0.22 seconds, though admittedly just a tad slower than the F1 Plus’ 0.2 seconds. More often than not, the speed and sensitivity of the sensor is taken for granted. But every millisecond you wait adds up to wasted time. And despite being fast, it is still accurate, which can’t be said of some fingerprint scanners, even those from big brands.. But that’s not where the OPPO F1s’ fingerprint reader excels. It is impressive because of how OPPO has utilized its speed and accuracy to offer a unique feature on the smartphone. Just as you can easily register more than one, usually up to five, fingers to unlock your smartphone, you can actually assign different actions to each of those five fingers. So while your thumb unlocks your OPPO F1s as normal, your index finger can immediately take you to Facebook the moment you unlock your smartphone. Or your other thumb will let you jump to the camera up in a flash. Huawei and honor may have their swiping gestures on their fingerprint scanners, but OPPO takes off the gloves with this “One Touch” feature.. And now we get to the meat of the OPPO F1s, what this particular smartphone is all about. While the likes of Samsung, LG, and Apple are in a rat race for the best main camera on a smartphone, OPPO is content to run in a niche category of its own: selfies. This, if you remember, is the very same company who brought the odd, rotating camera in the OPPO N1. But now the OPPO F1s trumps that, not just in megapixel size but also in actual performance.. The F1s’ front camera has a 16 megapixel 1/3.1-inch sensor with a lens aperture of f/2.0. Already, it beats its own main camera, which only gets a 13 megapixel sensor of the same size but with a smaller f/2.2 opening. Here, theory and practice meet, and the OPPO F1s lives up to its name as a Selfie Expert. That said, it isn’t the only one in OPPO’s stable, as the OPPO F1 Plus has the exact same front facing camera.. The OPPO F1s’ selfie expertise, however, has one rather puzzling limitation. Like many cameras, the front shooter works best under bright light. It does, however, terribly under less than ideal situations. That’s because the OPPO F1s doesn’t have a front-facing LED flash, though the F1 Plus doesn’t have one either. It simply uses a screen flash, that instantly and temporarily turns your screen white, to make up for the lack of a real one. It’s a disappointing deficiency in a smartphone whose entire essence is dependent on selfies.. The rear camera, though less sensational, is at least decent. It does have its own LED flash, but the smaller f/2.2 aperture basically cancels out the benefit. It does better in low light, but not to the point of being extraordinary.. By no means is the OPPO F1s a spectacular smartphone. There really is no going around that, despite the marketing. For what it’s supposed to do, it does it well, but not to the point of overtaking the more premium, and more expensive, competition. And although it falls short of becoming a perfect selfie machine, it does earn its keep as a Selfie Expert.. But here’s the thing: you aren’t going to find a more impressive smartphone at that price.. The OPPO F1s goes for around $270 in markets where it is available. The cheapest flagship-level smartphone you’ll be able to get your mitts on is the OnePlus 3, but that costs nearly double at $399. And that won’t give you a super fast and multi-functional fingerprint scanner or a real Selfie Expert. The OPPO F1s is an unexpected gem in a sea of wallet-friendly smartphones that are starting to all look-alike. Once you get past the initial prejudice of its appearance, you will discover, much to your surprise, a very capable Android smartphone with some tricks up its sleeves. They usually say that you get what you pay for, but with the OPPO F1s, you are certainly receiving a lot more.. Topics Android oppo Phone Reviews Phones Photography smartphone.

As was the case with the older F1, Oppo markets the F1s as "The Selfie Expert", and looking at the specs of the secondary camera on the front, it's easy to see why: the Oppo F1s integrates a 16MP selfie camera with a 1/3.1-inch sensor and an aperture of f/2.0. Selfie camera aside, the Oppo F1s specs are mid-range ones. The display, for one, is a 5.5-inch panel running at a rather modest resolution of 720 by 1280 pixels. The chipset of choice, the Mediatek MT6750 chipset, is a ... nother mid-range component, integrating a 1.5GHz octa-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU. In the memory department, the Oppo F1s comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of integrated storage space. Other specs include a fingerprint reader embedded in the physical home button, dual-SIM and microSD compatibility via a triple-slot tray, as well as Android 5.1 Lollipop overlaid with Oppo's own Color OS 3.0..
