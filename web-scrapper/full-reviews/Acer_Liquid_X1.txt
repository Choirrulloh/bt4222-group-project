Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Face detection, Geo tagging. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 6.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 10.4 days (250 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. Data: LTE Cat 4 (150/50 Mbit/s), HSPA, HSUPA.

A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

CNET también está disponible en español.. Acer pairs an octa-core CPU with LTE in the Liquid X1 smartphone (hands-on). The 5.7-inch Liquid X1 boasts some serious processing power with its eight-core 1.7GHz CPU and Cat 4 LTE capabilities.. by June 2, 2014 9:29 PM PDT. The Acer Liquid X1 on display at Computex 2014. The Zoom Fit option on the X1 resizes the interface to a 4-inch 'screen'. The textured rear is reminiscent of the Galaxy S5. TAIPEI, Tawain -- First launched at the end of May , Acer was showing off its powerful new Liquid X1 smartphone on the Nangang show room floor at Computex 2014.. The X1 sits firmly in the phablet category with a 5.7-inch display and an impressive octa-core processor. Combined with Category 4 LTE capabilities -- a theoretical download speed of 150Mbps -- this phone has some very real appeal for the power user.. The rear of the X1 has a dimpled texture, reminiscent of the Galaxy S5. For a big phone, it's good to have some grip, and while imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, it's also extremely practical for something of this size. The weight was hard to judge thanks to the security chain keeping it out of the bags of less scrupulous Computex attendees but, according to Acer, it tips the scales at 160g.. The screen resolution was, surprisingly, 1,280x720. I say surprisingly because the X1 screen is beautiful -- bright and clear -- and I would have expected it to be Full HD at the least.. At the top and bottom of the screen, almost invisible to the eye, are two forward facing speakers, a bit like the setup on the HTC One. Finally, the screen has something Acer is calling 'Glove and Water Touch'. Essentially the screen is sensitive enough to handle covered or wet hands.. Obviously, Acer is making a lot of noise about the octa-core 1.7GHz processor. While no one at the Acer stand was forthcoming about the manufacturer, my colleague Aloysius Low assures me it's a MediaTek processor. It's rounded out with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, along with a 13-megapixel camera. The camera also has a 0.3 second focus time and motion tracking.. One particularly neat software trick from Acer is the Zoom Fit, built for people who complain that phones are getting too big. By holding down the home button and dragging it off to the left, you can Zoom Fit, which immediate resizes your screen interface to 4-inches. You can then reposition the smaller interface anywhere on the 5.7-inch screen that you like. It's a bit odd, but it's meant to convert the X1 for one-handed operation.. I'm a big fan of big phones and at first blush the X1 has a lot going for it. Unless you're only going to be satisfied with a Full HD screen, this phablet should appeal to anyone looking for speed both in connectivity and processor.. No pricing was available, although the X1 is expected to ship in Q3 of this year.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

1 – 18 of 29. With a huge battery, 13-megapixel camera and high-quality audio, Acer's Liquid Zest Plus manages to surprise with a low price.. The Liquid Jade Primo is the first of a new breed of Windows 10-powered phones capable of linking up with a keyboard, mouse and monitor to be used like a desktop PC.. Acer has a range of new Android phones, which boast high-resolution front-facing cameras -- and tiny price tags.. Running on Microsoft's new Windows 10 Mobile operating system, the Acer Liquid M330 and M320 will arrive later this year in Europe and Asia.. The new phone runs Windows 10 Mobile with Microsoft's Continuum software, enabling it to power a workstation all by itself.. The 5-inch Liquid Z520 and the 4-inch Liquid Z220 won't cost you very much.. The Liquid M220 has a 4-inch display and a low price tag.. Acer brings its ultralight 5-inch LTE Liquid Jade Z and Liquid Z410 smartphones stateside.. If you're the sort with too many phone lines and not enough phones, this Acer smartphone could be exactly what the doctor ordered.. The 5.7-inch Liquid X1 boasts some serious processing power with its eight-core 1.7GHz CPU and Cat 4 LTE capabilities.. The low-priced Acer Liquid Z4 joins the ranks of other pint-size and affordable Android smartphones, and aims to make an impact at MWC 2014.. The Acer Liquid E3 smartphone uses a front-facing flash for better selfies in low lighting.. Priced at 169 Euros, the new Acer Liquid Z5 strives to bring advanced yet affordable Android capabilities to Europe and Asia.. Extend is a laptop-like accessory Acer says could be sold in a bundle with an Android phone for as little as €400.. The Acer Liquid S2 is a new 6-inch rival to the Samsung Galaxy Note that brings both 4G data connection and ultra-high-definition 4K video.. If you can overlook mismatched colors, wonky design, and a mediocre camera, the unlocked Liquid E2 brings quad-core Android Jelly Bean smarts for an affordable price.. At Computex 2013 in Taipei, Acer debuted its Liquid S1 phablet, which sports a 5.7-inch display, a quad-core processor, and an 8-megapixel camera.. The Acer Liquid E1 costs a reasonable 199 euros and comes equipped with stereo speakers, DTS digital audio, plus Android Jelly Bean.. Related Deals and Promotions. All Deals.

The smartphone will be initially available for purchase in Taiwan. Acer Liquid X1 Phablet with 5.7-Inch Display and Android KitKat Finally Goes on Sale. Acer announced back in late May that the Liquid X1, its attempt to be successful on the phablet market, would be available for purchase sometime in Q3 2014.. True to its promise, Acer has recently announced that its Liquid X1 phablet is available for purchase in Taiwan through major carrier Chunghwa Telecom. The good news is that Acer is only asking about $265 (€200) for the Liquid X1, which is a great deal considering its specs sheet.. In even more good news, Acer has confirmed that the Liquid X1 will be available for purchase in other countries as well, but has not shared details on exact release date for the moment.. According Focus Taiwan , citing Towny Huang, president of Taiwan operations at Acer, the company plans to boost its phablet sales with two more handsets that will be launched on the market in Q4 2014 and Q1 2015, respectively.. On the other hand, Acer’s CEO Jason Chen has said that his company will take cautious steps in the smartphone market, focusing on quality rather than quantity.. Back on Acer Liquid X1, the phablet, that was announced a few months ago and has finally made it to market, boasts a large 5.7-inch IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen display that supports HD (720p) resolution.. In order to keep the phablet’s price down to a decent amount that will make it competitive, Acer decided to include a MediaTek MT6592 chipset in it, which packs an octa-core processor, a Mali-450MP4 graphics processing unit, and no less than 2GB of RAM.. Furthermore, the Liquid X1 packs 16GB of internal memory, but users can further expand storage up to 32GB via a microSD card slot. Another strong point of the phablet would be the fact that it comes with support for LTE connectivity, which makes it perfectly viable for well-developed markets as well.. On the back, Acer Liquid X1 features an impressive 13-megapixel photo snapper with autofocus, LED flash and full HD (1080p) video recording, while in the front there’s a secondary 2-megapixel camera for video calls.. Although the smartphone is powered by a high-capacity 2700mAh battery, there’s no telling how much it will last, as Acer has yet to rate it for standby and talk time. Last but not least, the Liquid X1 ships with Android 4.4.2 KitKat operating system out of the box.. Acer Liquid X1 is a great alternative for those who can’t afford to pay for phablets like Galaxy Note or other more expensive handsets in the same category. Here is hoping that Acer will bring the Liquid X1 to other countries sooner rather than later.. # Acer Liquid X1 # KitKat smartphone # Acer Liquid # Android phone # Liquid X1.
