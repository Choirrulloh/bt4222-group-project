The display on the device is bright and vivid; however it has black bezel around it and the screen is not visible in direct sunlight. Carrying the smartphone with you is not as easy as you would think; it doesnât fit inside the pocket as well. Camera performance is sharp and accurate in daylight conditions only, and not too accurate in low. So, only if youâre looking for an enormous entertainment product, go for Zenfone 3 Ultra. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 03/24/2017 Rating: Total score : 60%. Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra Review Source: Gadget Diary The phone is priced at Rs. 49,999 which in my opinion is a bad pricing. You will find much better phones in the price range. But then, people are still buying this phone because it does have something to offer i.e a huge display and Asus has used top quality components to build the phone.

Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra Review: Don't Judge a book by its cover Source: The Mobile Indian This at first glance looks pretty decent and promise a lot, but as you use it does not stand out in many fronts be it the camera the or the heating problem I faced while playing games, even the big screen might be a dealbreaker for some. all in all, I will suggest there are many other options in this range with the similar screen size that might fulfill all the needs expected from this Phablet or tablet. Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 02/12/2017. 64% Asus ZenFone 3 Ultra ZU680KL Review Source: Think Digit The Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra is a decent smartphone, but it doesn't make sense at Rs. The Xiaomi Mi Max is pretty much as fast and a more colourful screen. The Zenfone 3 Ultra does have a better camera, but it still doesn't belong in the premium range. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 01/17/2017 Rating: Total score : 64%. Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra Review: The Mighty Multimedia Slab Source: Tech PP It scores heavily on multimedia, battery and design, but the fact is that the biggest stumbling block for the Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra is likely to be its price of Rs 49,999. That is more than the Samsung Galaxy S7 at the time of writing and well above the likes of the OnePlus 3T, Moto Z Play and the Nubia Z11, all of which can compare favorably with it in terms of specs and performance in most regards. One area where the Ultra holds its own is in its role as a pocket theater, thanks to that display and sound with the battery chipping in to ensure that your videos go on for a while. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 12/29/2016. 65% Asus ZenFone 3 Ultra review: The Director's Cut of smartphones Source: India Today The ZenFone 3 Ultra is too big for one. Its sheer size and scale could be a major turn-off for many. Then again, it could have made a lot of sense for someone who is a multimedia junkie who loves to Netflix, or read e-books, or someone simply looking to replace their Android tablet with a full-functional phablet. If you're looking for a large phablet, you're better off saving (a lot of) money and buying the Xiaomi Mi Max. The only trade-off perhaps would be the camera, but all in all, the Mi Max is capable of hitting the ZenFone 3 Ultra straight out of the ball park, in every sense of the word. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 12/21/2016 Rating: Total score : 65%. Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra Review Source: Fone Arena Calling the Zenfone 3 Ultra, a phone, is a bit of a stretch. For that matter it transcends even the phablet category and is approaching small tablet standards. Marginally smaller than a Nexus 7, it really puts media consumption and battery life first. On those fronts, the phone excels with a very good screen though points could be deducted for it not being a Quad HD panel. The exemplary battery life further aids its claim of being a content consumption device.

I am sure there are a lot of users who have genuine use for a smartphone that offers an extra-large screen and this will appeal to them. But I think a lot of buyers might get this for the camera and battery life, choosing to adjust and live with the larger build.

While we really like the premium look and feel, the display, fingerprint sensor and software-based tweaks, the large size and occasional heating issues are the downsides.

We find that devices of this nature arenât practical as everyday smartphones, but you might like to have something like this more as a tablet with a SIM card for mobile data and the occasional voice call.

ASUS ZenFone 3 Ultra ZU680KL review - Finally, a powerful and premium all-in-one phone tablet Source: Tech Nave Coming in with an RM2599 price tag and 6.8-inch full HD display, the ASUS ZenFone 3 Ultra ZU680KL is just 0.2-inches short of a full 7-inch tablet. Still, ASUS have done a very good job of shrinking the bezels so that it looks like a very large phone instead of a tablet phone. Featuring a flat and thin all metal design, the ZenFone 3 Ultra has "invisible antennas" or no visible antenna bands but is the only ZenFone 3 to put the fingerprint sensor in the home button (also the only one with a physical home button for that matter). Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 10/21/2016. The ASUS ZenFone 3 Ultra (ZU680KL) Phablet Review Source: Tech ARP The ASUS ZenFone 3 Ultra is, no doubt, the best phablet ASUS has ever made. A premium phablet, made out of metal and glass. It represents a massive upgrade in features and build quality over its predecessor, the ZenFone 2 Laser (ZE601KL). ASUS is definitely trying to move up the value chain.

Otherwise, if you were to it this phone against other with the same price range at P32,995 ($700US) then perhaps you should look elsewhere as there are far faster and better specs.

Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra Review: Is That Gigantic Screen Worth It? Source: Unbox The Zenfone 3 Ultra is the biggest phablet that weâve ever encountered so far this year, and its size is both its strength and weakness. On the upside, the phones huge display is a boon for people who watch a lot of movies and play games on the go. The downside is that itâs difficult to use as a daily driver, even if you have big hands. Its price too, is a limiting factor â at Php 32,995, itâs already going up against high-profile flagships that have better (but smaller) displays with nicer cameras and features.

ASUS Zenfone 3 Ultra Review Source: Yugatech With the Zenfone 3 Ultra, ASUS is not only trying to redefine the phablet, but also wants to set a benchmark on what a multimedia powerhouse smartphone should be. With that goal in mind, the company decided to just supersize everything. And if youâre the type whoâs looking for a smartphone-slash-tablet, the Ultra seems like the almost perfect device.

Watch: Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra Unboxing And Initial Review Source: Unbox ASUSâs 6.8-inch Zenfone 3 Ultra is a gigantic phablet decked out with hefty internals and a premium metal build. More tablet than a phone, the Zenfone 3 Ultra is ASUSâ attempt at making a high-end device that straddles the fine line between portable and unwieldy. Given the phabletâs flagship-level price, will ASUS succeed with the Zenfone 3 Ultra? Editor-at-large John Nieves explores that question and more in this video unboxing review. Single Review, online available, Very Short, Date: 08/25/2016. Unboxing & Review: ASUS ZenFone 3 Ultra Source: Tech Critter Lastly the price, at RM2599 that shouts "flagship", that is not very convincing for a phone that only comes with mid-ranged Qualcomm Snapdragon 652. If and only if ASUS were to pair this phone with a flagship worthy SoC, it will definitely hold back quite a few potential customers because, at the same price, they can instead get a high spec ZenFone 3 Deluxe. Unless you're looking for a phone that is larger than a phablet for your day to day usage, then you might consider having ZenFone 3 Ultra in your pocket.

Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra Unboxing And Initial Review: A Tablet Masquerading As A Phone Source: Unbox Aside from its sheer size, the Zenfone 3 Ultra faces an uphill battle as far as pricing is concerned. At Php 32,995, itâs already priced at flagship territory. ASUS is hoping the allure of a big-screen phone aimed at entertainment segment will be more than enough incentive for people to fork over money for the Zenfone 3 Ultra. Will it work? Only time will tell. Single Review, online available, Very Short, Date: 08/24/2016.

Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 10/05/2016. Model : The Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra ZU680KL is a huge 6.8-inch smartphone built for users who watch a lot of videos. Its massive 4,600 mAh battery can be charged quickly thanks to Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 technology, which will charge it from flat to 60% in just 45 minutes. It can even charge attached devices such as a power bank with a high current of up to 1.5 A. According to Asus, itâs the first smartphone in the world fitted with a 4K UHD TV-grade video processor, while a 6.8-inch Full HD (1,920 x 1,080) display delivers top notch graphics. Looking at the design, the Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra ZU680KL features a sleek, diamond-cut all-metal unibody. The chassis of the smartphone is made of aerospace-grade aluminum alloy and a CNC special crafted metal body protects the ZenFone 3 Ultra. It is infused with the spirit of Zen: the embodiment of luxury, beauty and simplicity. It integrates invisible antennas design with a technology called PureMetal. The ZenFone 3 Ultra tapers to 6.8 mm at its thinnest edge, curving ergonomically for the perfect grip. It is finished with a chamfer all the way around, diamond-cut to mere 0.18 mm width, which is almost as fine as a single strand of human hair. For display, Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra ZU680KL features the ASUS Tru2Life+ technology which has motion-estimation and motion compensation (MEMC) algorithms for smooth, blur-free video that doesnât judder. It also enables a 95% NTSC color gamut to deliver vibrant colours. Gorilla Glass 4 protects the screen from minor scratches and damages.. As for audio, the ZenFone 3 Ultraâs SonicMaster 3.0 technology gives it supreme audio performance for entertainment or calls. Dual five-magnet speakers driven by a powerful NXP Smart AMP, give an expansive, high-volume output. From a simple test with music, the phoneâs sound system is remarkable. It provides just enough bass without affecting its clarity. And for calls, SonicMaster 3.0 ensures the very best voice quality in VoLTE (Voice over LTE) calls even in the noisiest environments, with advanced noise cancelling and voice enhancement technologies. The ZenFone 3 Ultra features PixelMaster 3.0, which packs a 23 MP camera, 92 MP Super Resolution technology, large f/2.0-aperture lens and subject-tracking TriTech auto-focus for any distance and lighting clarity in just 0.03 seconds. It utilizes both optical and electronic image stabilization for blur-free shots and videos and a color correction sensor for true color photography. Besides that, it also features real-time HDR that properly shows the resulting HDR photo as framed. All these results in a rather good photo quality but it is still easily beaten by serious contenders such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and iPhone 7 Plus. Another thing to note is the lack of proper manual mode for the camera. The ZenFone 3 Ultra is packed with a 64-bit, Snapdragon 652 processor, which is quite a weird choice for a top-range device, and 4 GB of RAM. The ZenFone 3 Ultra also has 300 Mbps 4G LTE and intuitive fingerprint security that unlocks it in a fraction of a second. In short, the Zenfone 3 Ultra is a serious smartphone with some really cool features. For its price, it does an amazing job. Just donât expect it to be a flagship killer and youâll be fine.. Only a few smartphones have larger screens. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. This weight is typical for smartphones.. In the notebook sector, Asus had a global market share of about 11% from 2014-2016, making it the fourth largest laptop manufacturer. In the smartphone sector, Asus is not among the Top 5 and has only a small market share (as of 2016).. Similar devices from a different Manufacturer. Lenovo Phab 2 Pro Adreno 510.

Are there other issues with the phone which cannot be resolved because i live in Nigeria and no after sales support and return back option here. will be grateful for a quick answer Thank you. Can someone tell me which audio DAC it uses - asus india does not have any info about it ?. I have Vivo x5 max and Mi max1 prime [128 gb version] so need one BIG phone [like mi max] with Hi-Res audio support - one device for all audio and video needs instead of two devices. Is the audio DAC of this phone better than that of vivo x5 max ?. no info on the internet about this ?. For us taller people with bigger hands and pockets, this screen size is great! Add more high end stuff and will support it all the way!!. Samsung just dropped out of the race without a decent 7inch phone, masquerade a '6.3inch' note8 and discontinued the tab s2 8.0..... nanivon, 17 Aug 2017 Sorry, but again the Mi phones really does not appeal to me as a brand. more I see you are a brand conscious/brand first buyer because the Mi Mix I recommended is far better in build quality and features than your Zenfone 3 ultra ever is, and the Mi Mix is far superior in features and yet lower in price than your Zenfone 3 ultra. If you see Xiaomi as a brand as too 'low end' for your taste, it's your perception. I can't blame you for that even if your perceived impression of the brand has no real basis in facts. As for me, my experience with Asus has put it lower than Xiaomi in the durability ladder. It left me buying the brand with caution. Common Asus phone owner complaints from my friends include overheating, usb port becoming loose and no longer charging, glitchy apps after every update, rapidly deteriorating battery, and bootloops. Personally, my Asus Nexus 2013 lte tablet is no longer charging due to the loose/damaged usb port, its power button fell off as it became brittle and cracked, and I've been living with its phantom touches on the screen and the drastically reduced battery life. It's probably isolated but hearing complaints from other Asus users as well make me recommend the brand with a lot more caution than Xiaomi. That is based on experience and not just some gut feel.. I am very much sad and angry at Asus for not releasing a newer model of zenfone 3 ultra for 2017. I was waiting and waiting for the news at the conference to come up but unfortunately i didnot come. I have this phone since it got released and i love every aspect of it. It is super phone in regard to the screen size and audio level in addition to the camera and battery life. God I hate you Asus for ignoring this phone categry.. nanivon, 17 Aug 2017 Sorry, but again the Mi phones really does not appeal to me as a brand. more Sad to day you did not appreciate the value of money. Coming from Samsung s7, I always use mi max because of battery. Anyway people is different, some are always finds the looks. Anonymous, 14 Aug 2017 Actually the Mi Max 2 has an official global ROM version if you want to have the official Goog... more Sorry, but again the Mi phones really does not appeal to me as a brand. I really find the built quality as too low end for my taste. I already tried the Mi Max and I was not impressed with the built, OS and performance of the phone. It's a good back up phone because of its battery life but that just it. I really want a similar phone like my current Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra but with updated specs and design. The size is also perfect for me too. I still want the 6.8 inches screen.. Pages: 1 2 3 … 22 23 ». Total of 456 user reviews and opinions for Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra ZU680KL ..

ASUS ZenFone 3 Ultra ZU680KL Reviews. ASUS Zenfone 3 Ultra is a 6.8inch FHD 1920 x 1080 of display, Android OS, v6.0.1 runs on a Qualcomm MSM8976 Snapdragon 652processor.. 6.8 inches, 1080 x 1920 p... 2G, 3G, 4G (LTE), 128GB, ... Please feel free to post your review on this product.. I used to use Z Ultra and Z3, but replaced them with this.. It looks luxurious with metal used fully. It is as good as high-end smartphones from other makes.. I carried Z Ultra for using with wi-fi connection and Z3 for voice calls, so I am happy that now I only have to carry one device, ZenFone 3 Ultra.. It was difficult to operate at first because the physical button felt hard and I was used to having a key on the screen. But I have no problem with it now as I got Bar Launcher app.. It is fast in this order; ZenFone 3 Ultra, Z3 and then Z Ultra.. With Sony, I can only choose some preinstalled fonts, but with ZenFone 3 Ultra, I can install font I like using i-Font app. As for home launcher, I had used NOVA and customized a lot. Now that I have customized ZenFone 3 Ultra in the same way, there is not much difference.. ZenFone 3 Ultra has a good speaker, so it is very easy to listen to. Overall voice call sound quality is more satisfying than I had imagined.. When it is held vertically, the speaker has excellent sound. But sadly, when I put it sideway, its performance drops.. It lasts longer than I imagined. It lasts for a day even when I use it heavily. I always carry 10000mAh battery anyway, so I am not so fussy about battery life, but I give it 5 stars when it lasts for two days fully used heavily.. I was waiting for Z Ultra's successor model, but it seemed it wouldn't be released, so I got this. OS is now version 6.0, so I don't need to carry two devices anymore. I replaced Xperia Z5 premium with this. I got this because it had terrible battery life.. It has high-end feel to it with its metallic body. Its sides might get scratches easily, though.. It looks like a small tablet. When I use it for voice calls, people look at me. Unexpectedly, it fits in my pocket.. Home button is a physical button. Volume button on its back is convenient when using voice calls.. It has ATOK installed, but it is an old one.. It has no problem and works lightly.. It has 4GB, so it works very pleasantly.. What I am happiest about this phone is its size and image quality. It is excellent both with WEB and YouTube.. But because I watch movies with this sideway, the position of the speaker is disappointing. Also, the sound it makes when it has focused and shutter release sound are too loud. I hope it gets improved with update.. Because it has big capacity, I cannot use it till it goes flat in one day. I feel safe with this and power efficient CPU.. It seems phablets are getting popular in Japan finally. This is the biggest size for a phablet. I think this will be my partner for a long time.. It has achieved perfect complementarity of a smartphone and a tablet.. It is flat and has narrow bezel, so it doesn't feel big for its screen size. It is simple and has high-end feel to it. This definitely is too big compared to iPhone or other smartphones in general, but it fits in my pocket. It fits in my jacket pocket, too.. It has a home button/fingerprint sensor below the screen, so I can operate it without picking it up leaving it on a table.. It has the newest mid-high SoC, so it works very lightly. It is very fast to launch any apps.. It is easy to use that I can bring up many functions by gesture. Because my main machine is iPhone, I got muddled, but once I got used to it, I have no problem with it.. I was worried as it is only FHD for 6.9inch display. But I didn't need to worry about it. It especially shows its ability when playing movies. You definitely would be impressed how smooth it looks and its little afterimage for quick moves. It is way smoother my iPad Pro.. It is clear and easy to hear.. It has about 50% of battery remaining at night for my usage.. There are not many devices you can have amazing experience with like this smartphone. I have used ZenFone3, ZenFone 3 DX, Mate 9, iPhone 6S etc. within past 6 months, but this is the one I was impressed with the most when I opened that box and touched it. If you seek portability, I recommend other device, but if you would like to satisfy your desire to possess, this would be a good choice, too.. I use 5.2inch Xperia Z5 for a smartphone, and 10.1inch Xperia Z2 Tablet (Wi-Fi model) for a tablet. I got this thinking this would be a handy size to take out for its size being between these two devices and has 4GB. With its full-metal body, it has both luxurious feel and rigidity. I would like you to understand this evaluation as a device with 6.8inch display, but this is just right. It is thin and light with FHD, and it fits in a chest pocket of my jacket. If it was 7inch or 8inch, it would be difficult to do so, but I can do so with this device. The power button is in the middle of its side, so it is well balanced design-wise. Having said that, thinking when I turn it on and hold, it would have been better if it was positioned lower. The home button feels heavy, so it needs to be lighter or the stroke is shallower or make it a touch key.. Also, the back button and menu key need to be touched properly to get it responded.. From the usability of the home button and menu key, I got stars off of it.. It works lightly with launching apps, changing between pages, and so on. The setting menu is relatively subdivided small and hierarchy is not so deep. So it is easy to reach where you want to.. Dropdown list from menu button has a big icon and easy to understand.. The coloring is rich, and it is rather warm. It is not too sharp and is bright. When I watch movies with 5inch smartphones, I need to have a close look at it sometimes, but with 6.8inch display of this smartphone, my eyes don't get tired as much, so I can keep watching for a long time.. On the other hand, I need to pinch in as I read e-books and Nikkei online paper which I was able to read somehow with Z2 Tablet, but I can still see the entire page, so it is not a big disadvantage.. Ability of description and color reproductivity are both good. I can do detailed manual setting, so once you get used to this, I think you can use it fully.. It shows a bar in the center for leveling, so I can photoshoot avoiding objects tilting.. The shutter release sound is rather loud as other people have pointed out, and it can be a negative.. The sound output with a headphone is good. It is not only thanks to its hardware but also ASUS's preinstalled music player app's high sound quality. It may not be as good as a MP3 player, but think this does better than Z5, which is well-known for its high sound quality.. Pitch extent, frequency balance and resolution are excellent. I can hear hi-hat cymbals clearly with and base drum sounds sharp with Hi-Res audio. Vocal sounds wet and clear, too. Localization of sound is well done, so you can immerse yourself in music.. One disappointing thing is that the preinstalled app I mentioned above shows songs in albums in alphabetical order, and it sometimes play songs in different order to its original order in the album. I hope they improve with the update of apps.. Because I mainly wrote about music, I didn't evaluate the speaker I don't use for listening to music and ringtones. I think it was more practical to have one speaker each on top and bottom, not two at the bottom, thinking watching movies using the phone sideway.. I don't think the battery life to be too short, but I think it consumes rather quickly for its 4,600mAh battery capacity. It is only my personal feel, but I feel Z2 Tablet with 6,000mAh has longer battery life, so I took it off stars comparing with it.. There are some items I took stars off because of minor points I was not fully happy with, but none of them are crucial disadvantages. This device has more advantages than these negatives.. The best thing about this device is its screen size and the size of the device. This is the biggest it can be as an easy-to-carry mobile phone. Pricewise, it feels rather expensive, but it fulfills my purpose of getting this device, and it actually does better. I am very happy with my purchase.. Ito na talaga ang Zenfone 3 ko mahal nga naman ito pero ayos lang kasi ang ganda nga naman ng design nito kitang kita rin naman na ang sulit ang pera ko sa pag bili nitong aking phone. Ang gaan lang din naman dalhin nitong aking phone at hindi rin naman sagabal sa akin to. Sobrang dali lang din naman ang pag gamit nito kasi ang tagal ko ng gumagamit ng ASUS na phone kaya ang dali na lang talaga sa akin to. Mabilis din naman maka access ng internet connections kaya mabilis din akong maka download ng mga applications at games sa aking phone kaya ang ayos lang nito. Ang camera din ay ganda at ang linaw ng pag kuha ng mga litrato kaya ang galing nito. Ang lakas din naman ng volume sa speaker kaya perfect na itong phone ko at ang haba din naman ng buhay sa baterya nito kaya mas lalong sulit to kasi mas maeenjoy ko lalo ang pag gamit.. Thanks to the big gift my handsome boyfriend I don't expect that you gave me this very beautiful and brand new phone I really happy to receive this kind of anniversary gift from my love. I like the design and display of this phone. Super handy and not hassle phone I want to used it. Easy to operate and used this it can also access easy the internet connection so great and I can download a lot of applications on this phone. The battery life is very long and last thing I love on it is the quality of the camera is very good and clear and also the volume of the speaker is very loud..

Buying a phone is fundamentally a personal choice to suit your needs. I like the size of this phone because I it allows me to perform laptop related tasks without having to carry around a lap top. The battery life is good, the memory capacity is also good, the screen is excellent. Also it has in my view the most powerful speakers in any phone to date. Finally although its processor is not the latest, the phone is zippy, with no lags. The phone is large I will admit, but personally i like large screens, so it an advantage to me. I am still able to fit it in my trouser pocket, The extra weight means that it lessens the possibility of me forgetting it somewhere. i am bound to miss its presence. I have no regrets with this purchase. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned. Current slide {CURRENT_SLIDE} of {TOTAL_SLIDES}- Explore Buying Guides.
