I am very much aware Lenovo has bought Motorola for a while now. And yes I am aware that the updates are slower than ever but does it make them worse off really?. Honor (& Huawei) have been very slow in their updates as far as history/reviews.... What do you mean by front camera is beast?. Mr.Tonikm, it's a stunning glass body on the back & aluminium frame around. With this specs, one can't find a phone that low in weight and beautifully designed..

Dual-camera setups are the rage of the season, and the Honor 9 Lite comes with a dual-camera setup on both sides. We review this stunning new device from Huawei-owned Honor.. Published: January 17, 2018 1:30 PM IST. The Honor 9 Lite is priced at Rs 10,999.. The phone runs on EMUI 8.0 based on Android Oreo.. The device has dual-camera setups at both the front and the back.. While we in India may not have noticed, Chinese smartphone maker Huawei grew to become the second largest smartphone maker in the world on global device sales. And while it may not seem like it, Huawei has a strong presence in India. Apart from extensive operations in the business-to-business side of things, the company also maintains a presence in the consumer space through its Huawei and Honor brands.. Although the Huawei brand isn’t quite as active in the smartphone space, the Honor brand definitely is. With frequent product launches, competitive prices and good smartphones, Honor is making a mark in various price segments, from the budget space to the ‘flagship killer’ space. Honor’s latest launch in India is the Rs 10,999. Honor 9 Lite , which comes close on the heels of the Rs 29,999 Honor View10. The new smartphone has a couple of evident things going for it, including dual-camera setups at both the front and back, as well as a glass-based build that makes the phone look fantastic. We review the Honor 9 Lite, and here’s what we think.. Honor View10 Review: Not your average flagship. What appeals to me the most about the Honor 9 Lite is the way it looks. At just 7.6mm thick, it’s a slim smartphone with a strong focus on design. The device has 2.5D curved glass at the front and back, which is notably different from the all-metal devices that we’re used to seeing in this price segment. What I definitely didn’t like about the phone is its plastic frame. It takes away from the otherwise excellent build quality, and will also make the phone a little less durable. This is of particular concern when you consider that the rest of the phone is glass. Drop it, and it’s likely to do some damage to the device.. The Honor 9 Lite is available in three color options – Black, Blue and Grey. They all look fantastic, but the Grey and Blue variants stand out for their own reasons. The Blue variant has a particularly catchy color that will attract looks from far away, while the Grey variant is almost a perfect mirror if lighting conditions are good enough. It sets the phone apart from most of what you’d find at a similar price, and some might even think it almost succeeds in looking like an Apple iPhone 8 Plus. from certain angles, thanks to the slightly bulging dual-camera setup.. Honor 7X Review: Capable mid-ranger with beautiful display. The front of the Honor 9 Lite also sticks to the color at the back, although there’s very little non-screen space to put that color in. The phone has a 5.65-inch full-HD+ screen with an 18:9 aspect ratio, leaving just thin slivers of room all around. The bottom just about manages to fit in the Honor logo, while the top has the earpiece, proximity sensor, notification light and dual-camera setup. It’s a fairly standard look on the whole, with nothing to complain about at the front. The screen itself is decent, maintaining sharpness and brightness without any issues.. With a solid set of specifications for the price, the Honor 9 Lite has what it takes to convince buyers of good value. With either 3GB or 4GB RAM, 32GB or 64GB of internal storage, hybrid dual-SIM connectivity and the HiSilicon Kirin 659 SoC, the phone is a solid mid-range performer. During our time with the device, I had no issues or complaints, with the phone proving to be a reliable daily driver.. The Kirin 659 SoC has been developed by Huawei subsidiary HiSilicon, and is fabricated on the 16nm FitFET+ process. It’s considered on par with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 SoC, and the Honor 9 Lite does indeed perform at the same levels. Although the Qualcomm chipset does in my opinion offer slightly better battery life, the Honor 9 Lite isn’t far behind. With a 3,000mAh battery under the hood, the phone will get through a day on a charge, and takes a little over two hours to charge using the bundled 10W charger. This is a bit disappointing, and a fast charger would have been a good addition to the package.. Dual-camera setups aren’t new, but it isn’t often that you see two sets of it on a phone. Although the Huawei Mate 10 Lite and Honor 9i were the first devices from the company to have two dual-camera setups, the Honor 9 Lite brings it back at a stronger price point, which gives it a distinct advantage here.. Moto X4 Review: Style and performance, but it isn't perfect. Dual-camera setups come in many configurations, with different manufacturers using the tech for different implementations. You can have wide-angle photography, monochrome + RGB for better light and detail capture, lossless zoom and depth-sensing for DSLR-like bokeh effects in your pictures. In the case of the Honor 9 Lite, just the depth-sensing abilities are made available by the two dual-camera setups. This means that whether you’re taking a picture of someone or a selfie, you will be able to take depth-of-field pictures that highlight the subject and blur out the background.. (Camera samples shot on the Honor 9 Lite). Let’s start with that then – the Honor 9 Lite takes portrait shots, and rather good ones at that. However, the software algorithms that process portrait shots are unlike what you’ll see on most other smartphones, and is naturally similar to that of the Honor View10 which uses the same software and interface. It’s tricky in that even if you have portrait mode and bokeh effect on, it won’t necessarily take the picture.. We found that unless the subject is looking at the camera, the phone doesn’t trigger the portrait mode at all. This means that pictures have to be properly composed and patiently put together to get it to work. This includes a steady hand to avoid blurs, as well as waiting just a moment longer to let the phone capture all of the information after you’ve hit the shutter button. If you get everything right, though, the results are great for a phone in this price range. The depth-of-field sensor does its job and captures the foreground cleanly. This is the case with both the front and rear camera setups, both of which use 13-megapixel plus 2-megapixel cameras. The front camera has fixed focus, which is tuned for selfies.. (Camera samples shot on the Honor 9 Lite). When it comes to everything else, the camera is a bit disappointing. Regular photos taken using the rear camera are average at best, with a lack of real detail, brightness and composure. Although the images look good on the small screen of the phone itself, a closer look on a PC reveals grain, dullness and a general lack of pop. The pictures aren’t bad; they just aren’t very good either. In roughly this price range, you’ll get better photography from the slightly more expensive. Xiaomi Mi A1 , which uses its dual-camera setup more effectively and delivers on everyday photography better.. Xiaomi Mi A1 Review: Truly A1!. (Camera samples shot on the Honor 9 Lite). The Honor 9 Lite is the second smartphone from Huawei in India to run on Emotion UI (EMUI) 8.0, which is the company’s latest iteration of its Android-based user interface. While the previous version was EMUI 5.1, Huawei has skipped a couple of numbers in between to bring the version number in line with the Android version that it is based upon. The company will follow a similar strategy going forward, and for now EMUI 8.0 effectively means that the smartphone is running on Android 8.0. This makes the Honor 9 Lite one of the few smartphones in the mid-range segment to be running the latest version of Android, with many manufacturers still stuck on Android Nougat.. However, EMUI 8.0 in its full glory also needs the right chipset to power it – that is the HiSilicon Kirin 970 that can be found on the Honor View10. Since the Honor 9 Lite and many of Huawei’s other phones use chipsets such as the Kirin 659, the company’s software development team have also configured a ‘light’ version of EMUI 8.0 for these phones. It doesn’t quite have all the fancy features that are present on the View10; the artificial intelligence-based features are skipped here, as is the AR-style translator that uses the camera app. However, other features including smart split screen and dynamic fonts are present.. The former builds on Android Oreo’s native split-spreen, by letting you quickly load notifications in split screen mode as they come, without interrupting what you’re already doing. Dynamic fonts allows the system to change font colors and styling on the fly based on the background; a light background would have a dark font and vice versa. And of course, considering that EMUI 8.0 is based on Android Oreo, you get all of the native benefits of the latest version of Google’s mobile operating system.. Honor 9i review: A smartphone trying to be perfect. Priced at Rs 10,999 (Rs 14,999 for the 4GB RAM/64GB storage version), the Honor 9 Lite has a lot going for it. The stunning looks and dual-camera setups on both sides stand out, but there’s also decent software, a good screen and decent specifications that make the phone a worthwhile option to consider in the mid-range segment. While the plastic frame, average camera performance with regular photography, standard battery life and slow charging are definite drawbacks, on the whole the Honor 9 Lite is a satisfyingly good smartphone, particularly considering that it’s significantly more affordable than similarly positioned competition.. While there’s a lot to justify it, competition in the mid-range space is as hot as ever. The Xiaomi Mi A1, Moto X4 and Huawei’s own Honor 9i. give the phone a tough fight, although the Honor 9 Lite does have the distinct advantage of being priced incredibly well. It’s an impressive device that hits many right notes, and is definitely worth a look if you want a good-looking phone and the ability to take neat portrait shots, without having to spend too much money. The phone goes on sale on January 21, exclusively on Flipkart.. Android 8.0 Oreo with EMUI 8.0. HiSilicon Kirin 659 Octa Core 2.36GHz Processor. 13MP + 2MP dual camera with Bokeh Effect.

Huawei Honor 9 Lite First Impressions Review: Seems Good For The Price. Huawei Honor 9 Lite smartphone will be available in two variants-- 3GB RAM/ 32GB and 4GB RAM/64GB--for Rs 10,999 and Rs 14,999 respectively.. Updated: January 18, 2018, 2:03 PM IST. Debashis Sarkar | News18.com @SarkDeb. Honor is simply going the ‘Xiaomi-way’ to offer a spec-loaded phone for a competitive price. The Honor 9 Lite is the latest smartphone from Huawei aiming to gain traction in the budget segment. Given the intense competition in the price range of Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000, smartphone brands have opted for “more the better for less money” strategy for quite some time. And the brand Honor is simply going the ‘Xiaomi-way’ to offer a spec-loaded phone for a competitive price. The only exception here is that the design of the Honor 9 Lite is way better than what other competitors are offering. The device will be available in two variants, 3GB RAM/ 32GB internal storage and 4GB RAM/64GB internal storage for Rs 10,999 and Rs 14,999 respectively. After spending some time with the Honor 9 Lite, here are our initial impressions. The Honor 9 Lite looks unique and will remind you of the older flagship Honor 8. For the price of Rs 10,999, the Honor 9 Lite is great looking smartphone. It’s an all-glass smartphone and looks ways more shinny than any other handset. So, if you don’t like a phone which is too shiny and reflective then the Honor 9 Lite might not be the phone for you. This is because the rear of the phone is literally a mirror. However, the front of the smartphone looks good with the almost bezel-less design. Being an all-glass device, it attracts a lot of fingerprints and you will have to be a bit careful as it is slippery. Overall, it is a well-built smartphone and feels good in the hands as well. Also read: Samsung Galaxy A8+ (2018) First Impressions Review: Power Packed For Rs 32,999 What to look out for?. The Honor 9 Lite features a dual-lens camera setup at the front and at the back as well, with one 13-megapixel primary lens and a 2-megapixel secondary lens. Overall, the image quality is good and in this price range, buyers can look up to the cameras. It features a 5.65-inch Full HD+ FullView display with an 18:9 aspect ratio and 2160x1080 pixel resolution. It is powered by Honor's own HiSilicon Kirin 659 octa-core SoC, with four cores clocked at 2.36 GHz and four at 1.7GHz. It runs Honor's own UI - EMUI 8.0 based on Android Oreo 8.0. Connectivity options on the Honor 9 Lite include hybrid dual-Nano SIM slots, 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth, GPS/ A-GPS, 3.5mm audio jack, and a Micro-USB with OTG support. The smartphone is backed by a 3000 mAh battery. The Honor 9 Lite has a lot to promise for its price. If the device is able to actually deliver then it has a good chance to be the new budget smartphone king. WATCH VIDEO: Tech and Auto Show EP 28 | 2018 Audi Q5, LG V30+ & More.

CNET también está disponible en español.. Honor 9 Lite: Four cameras and luxe design impress us so far. This phone has the makings of a good deal.. by February 6, 2018 3:00 AM PST. The glass back and four cameras of the Huawei Honor 9 Lite. 13-megapixel camera with depth sensor on front and back. 32GB storage (expandable with microSD cards up to 256GB). So far, the Honor 9 Lite seems to be plagued by few of the compromises you'd usually get when buying a budget phone. It looks good, it's got plenty of power, and a big screen. It even goes a step beyond with a total of four cameras to capture the moment.. That's a whole lot of phone and at only £200, it's unquestionably affordable. There's no official word from Honor yet about if or when the phone will hit the US and Australia, but for reference, that price converts to $280 and AU$353, respectively.. The design is probably my favourite thing about the phone. Its deep blue colour is a signature hue of almost all of Honor's phones, but it sets it apart from the typical grey or black phones you'll often find at this price. The back is covered in a sheet of shiny glass, giving it a much more premium aesthetic than you might expect for the low price. Admittedly, that glass is a total fingerprint magnet, and it might make it more susceptible to breaking if dropped, but that may be a worthwhile tradeoff if you want a great-looking handset.. The front is dominated by a 5.6-inch display with extremely slim bezels around the edge. Its 2,160x1,080-pixel resolution makes it pin sharp too.. I spent a few days with the Honor 9 Lite, and was able to run CNET's usual battery of performance benchmark tests. In those results, it performed well, beating many similarly priced phones, such as the Nokia 6. As you'd expect, it's not a match for premium phones like the Galaxy S8 or, indeed, Huawei's own Mate 10 Pro. What I don't know yet is how well it performs in everyday life. That's something I'll be able to evaluate after we've given the phone the full review treatment.. The phone has dual camera setups on both the back and front. Each side has a main 13-megapixel sensor with an additional sensor designed purely to capture depth information. It helps to give that DSLR-style depth of field to portraits, and by having it on the front too, you can capture selfies with an attractive 'bokeh' blurring around your face.. Honor 9 Lite front-facing camera test. The effect worked adequately in our early tests. In this example image, it's clear to see how the phone has blurred the background around me, but the 'cut-out' of my face isn't neat, resulting in parts of my hair being blurred into the background. Overall the shot is at least good enough for a Facebook post.. Shots from the main camera are about what I'd expect from a phone at this price; good enough to for some holiday snaps in bright sunlight, but lack the overall clarity and punchy colours you'd get from a higher-end phone. If top-notch photography is important to you, it's looking like you may want to consider a different phone. I'll give the Honor 9 Lite's cameras a more thorough test when I'm able to review it fully. There's no waterproofing of any kind, which is one of the main compromises you'll have to make in opting for a budget handset. Even Honor's pricier View 10 isn't waterproof, and you'll need to splash out many hundreds more to get the waterproof Huawei Mate 10 Pro. The 9 Lite also charges using the rather outdated micro-USB, rather than USB-C. That's perhaps not much of an issue, as it will at least mean it's compatible with the stack of micro-USB cables you've likely got cluttering up your drawers at home.. In terms of specs, there's little that competes with the Honor 9 Lite at this price. The Nokia 6 costs around the same but its sluggish performance lets it down, and I personally prefer the glossy blue of the Honor. The Motorola Moto G5 Plus was our budget champion of last year, but its higher price, bulkier design and lack of a neat multicamera setup means the Honor 9 Lite is well placed to usurp the Moto's position..

Huawei Honor 9 Lite first impressions: Quad-camera smartphone priced from Rs 10,999 onwards has immense potential. Jan 22, 2018 20:28 PM IST. Huawei is on a smartphone announcement spree. After launching the Honor 9i , Honor 7X and the Honor View 10 within a span of a month, one would assume the brand would take some time out — and maybe give us poor journalists a break. But no, they just had to go and launch another smartphone.. That new phone is the Honor 9 Lite, has been released in India at Rs 10,999 for the 3 GB RAM and 32 GB storage variant. The 4 GB / 64 GB variant is priced at Rs 14,999. It will start selling on Flipkart from 21 January onwards.. The Honor 9 Lite is quite the looker. Here are our first impressions of only the second Honor phone so far that sports quad-cameras.. The Honor 9 Lite borrows a lot of design elements from its siblings. This 5.65-inch, 18:9 aspect ratio, 2.5D curved display sporting phone has thin bezels on the right and left-hand sides. The Honor branding is noticed on the thin lower bezel. The top portion houses the dual cameras beside the tiny speaker section and the proximity sensor. The Honor 9 Lite comes with 2.5D glass on both the front and the back, separated by an aluminium frame. It measures around 7.6 mm thick.. The phone borrows many design elements from its siblings. Turn the phone around and you notice some finesse, as compared to the Honor 9i , 7X and even the View 10. The camera bump that was prominently noticeable in all the other three phones isn’t very pronounced (although it does rise by just a millimetre from the plane of the rear side) on the Honor 9 Lite. The circular fingerprint sensor is at the top-centre portion and its matte finish makes it stand out in the glossy surroundings.. For all practical purposes, it resembles a mirror as it is highly reflective. While I loved the Sapphire Blue colour variant as compared to the black and silver colour variants, the blue colour tends to attract a lot of smudges. These are easy to get rid of, unlike those on the metal back of the Honor 7X , but it can be annoying to constantly see smudges during your daily usage. The smudges are neatly masked on the silver backed Honor 9 Lite.. The good news is that the headphone jack is still here. The bad news is that there's no USB-C. The phone has an aluminium frame with rounded edges, which gives it a sufficiently good grip. While the volume rocker and power/standby button are located on the right-hand side, the SIM card tray is on the left-hand side. The bottom edge hosts the 3.5 mm audio jack, a microUSB charging port and data transfer port and the speaker grille section. The phone fits quite well in the hand, although one-handed operation will be challenging. At 149 g it is quite light to hold.. Overall, the Honor 9 Lite is a good-looking phone.. While Honor has clearly taken dual-camera phones to heart (which might soon become quad-camera phones), it also appears to have embraced 18:9 displays. The last three phones we saw from Honor sported 18:9 aspect ratio display and the trend continues with the Honor 9 Lite. You get a 5.65-inch, 18:9 aspect ratio display with a resolution of 1080x2160 pixels, which gives a pixel density of 428 PPI.. The 18:9 display is quite good. The panel is an IPS LCD and in the limited time I spent with it, I found the display to be quite decent. It can get quite bright, has good colour reproduction and has no noticeable colour shift when viewed from extreme angles. The text was sharp, and I noticed no pixellation.. Just like the Honor 9i and Honor 7X before it, the Honor 9 Lite also houses the HiSilicon Kirin 659 chipset which has an octa-core processor. It has a four Cortex A53 cores clocked at 2.36 GHz and another four Cortex A53 cores clocked at 1.7 GHz for the low-power tasks. On the graphics front, you have a Mali T830 MP2 GPU.. Our review unit comes with 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage, out of which around 53.6 GB is usable. There is a 3 GB RAM and 32 GB storage version of the same available as well.. On the connectivity front, you get a hybrid dual-SIM slot, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS with A-GPS and no infrared or radio.. One good thing about the Honor 9 Lite is that it comes with Android Oreo 8.0 out of the box. Of course, the Android OS gets a skinning treatment and comes with Huawei’s Emotion UI version 8.0 (EMUI 8.0). Huawei has fast-forwarded the version number of the EMUI from 5.1 to 8.0 to keep the EMUI version number the same as the Android version number, which makes a lot of sense when you think about it.. This is one of the few phones that will come with Android Oreo out of the box, albeit with some EMUI skinning. It must be noted that the Kirin 970 sporting Huawei View 10 has the full version of EMUI 8.0, which takes complete advantage of the chip’s neural network processing unit (NPU) to carry a lot of on-device machine learning tasks.. The Honor 9 Lite, which sports the Kirin 659 chipset, gets a light version of the EMUI 8.0, which does not have all the features that would be seen on the Kirin 970 chipset-supported phones. That said, the focus on on-device machine learning continues with the Honor 9 Lite, according to Huawei.. We have done a detailed analysis of EMUI 8.0 in our Honor View 10 review , so you can read up on that. We will attempt to enumerate the differences between OS variations in our upcoming review of the 9 Lite. Off the bat, I noticed that in the camera section, the object recognition feature wasn’t present.. The phone uses an unusual dual-camera layout where one low-res camera is dedicated to capturing depth information. The Honor 9 Lite continues the quad-camera tradition started by the Honor 9i. You get a 13 MP + 2 MP setup for the front camera as well as the rear camera. The 13 MP camera is the one which does the heavy lifting, whereas the 2 MP sensor is meant for capturing depth information, thereby helping you get that much-wanted bokeh effect with ease. The aperture mode lets you adjust the depth before as well as after capturing the photograph. Both the front and rear camera pairs are capable of shooting FullHD videos at 30 fps.. Unlike Huawei's most recent phones, the camera bump on the 9 Lite isn't so prominent. The user interface of the camera is quite straightforward. Swiping right brings up multiple modes such as Pro Photo, HDR, Panorama, Light painting among others. Swiping left brings up the settings menu. While trying out the camera indoors, I found the images to be a bit grainy. Outdoor daylight photos turned out well. But I will be doing a thorough testing of the camera during my review.. The Honor 9 Lite comes with a 3,000 mAh Li-Polymer battery which is non-removable. It supports Super Charge technology, which is Huawei’s fast-charging tech. But it comes with a microUSB 2.0 charging and data transfer port. This decision seems a bit odd in 2018 when USB Type-C should be mainstream.. The Rs 10,999 price point for the 3 GB / 32 GB variant is a disruptive price point which has the potential to redefine the budget segment. Xiaomi clearly has some competition on its hands in the sub Rs 15,000 space now.. Huawei has started 2018 with an interesting looking device, which seems to pack in all the features one expects from a mid-range Android phone. The four cameras, wonderful look and feel, an 18:9 aspect ratio display and Android Oreo 8.0 out of the box, are compelling features that are desirable for any Android smartphone buyer in 2018.. At Rs 10,999, Honor seems like it has a winner on its hands. The full detailed review will be out soon.. #Huawei Honor 9 Lite First Impressions. #Huawei Honor 9 Lite Release Date.

For the last couple of years, while buying smartphones, camera quality has become one of the top priorities. along with the processor, RAM, and Storage. People tend to compare camera quality in the cheapest possible smartphones let alone mid-rangers or flagships. In short, if you were to build a smartphone in this era, considering the camera is essential. And Huwaei has some similar thoughts too so we are here to compare two smartphone, Huawei Honor 9 Lite vs Xiaomi Mi A1 in this article. Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime with samsung pay mini launched, look at this article for more information.. Huawei’s latest smartphone, the Honor 9 Lite, is the new mid-range smartphone in the market. It undoubtedly is an excellent smartphone with proper specs & a beautiful design for the price which customers would fancy. But it has yet to prove that it is better than our last year’s mid-range favorite, Xiaomi’s Mi A1 .. Xiaomi’s Mi A1 has unquestionably been a mid-range favorite for consumers as well as experts. Hence, the capability of Honor 9 Lite to beat Mi A1 in the mid-range smartphone race is purely dependent on the quality of the phone.. Huwaei’s Honor 9 Lite comes in two variants. 10,999 for the 3GB option and another at Rs. Hence, depending on the price and specifications Mi A1 and Honor 9 Lite can go toe-to-toe for most of the part which leaves the camera quality the game-decider. With two monochrome sensors on the rear side, Honor 9 Lite can take great shots. But is it as good as or better than Xiaomi’s Mi A1?. We are going to compare both smartphones under specific conditions like Natural lights, Low Lights, Artificial Light, Camera UI and selfie camera so read this amazing article who will win the fight, Huawei Honor 9 Lite vs Xiaomi Mi A1.. The Honor 9 Lite comes with as 13MP+2MP rear camera as well as 13MP+2MP front-facing selfie camera. The 13MP sensor is the primary sensor, whereas the 2MP one is a monochrome sensor which is used for capturing depth.. On the other hand, the Mi A1 comes with a 12MP+12MP rear camera. The first 12MP is a wide-angle lens or the primary lens with a f/2.2 aperture, and the other 12MP lens is a f/2.6 telephoto lens. Apparently, the Mi A1’s camera isn’t as good as the iPhone 7 plus’s (as they were comparing). But is it better than its near-competition, i.e., Honor 9 Lite? Let’s find out. we have already added Xiaomi Mi A1 in. best looking smartphone in India.. Based on camera specifications, it’s certain that Honor 9 Lite is built to capture more details and better colors, whereas the Mi A1 focuses more on the portrait mode. Let’s check out the cameras by side-to-side comparison. But before starting the comparison, let’s have a look at the user interface of the camera.. Best 4G Smartphone Under 10,000 INR in India. As the brands are different, obviously the user interface is going to vary. So let’s find out which is better.. The software provided by Honor 9 Lite is pretty clean and easy to use. Just by swiping left or right, a bunch of modes are accessible. With easy controls, all the essential functions are available. On a negative aspect, around 40% of the phone’s screen is covered by black borders, which doesn’t leave enough space for the viewfinder.. Talking about the functionalities, you get camera switching mode, wide-aperture mode, flash controls, and moving picture mode on the top of the screen. side, you can find the galley shortcut, shutter button, and video switch.. Additionally, it has the Pro mode which enables you to tweak settings like ISO, exposure, focus, etc. Moreover, pro video mode, night shot, time-lapse, filters; watermarks, light painting, panorama, and more are also available. Other shortcuts like touch to capture, capture smiles and object tracking are also there.. This pretty much sums up everything about the Honor 9 Lite ‘s Camera UI. Let’s move on to Mi A1’s UI.. You might be aware of the camera interface of Mi A1 as it’s a comparatively old as well as a successful device, but still, let me give an overview.. In comparison to Honor 9 Lite, the camera UI on Mi A1 is more straightforward and gives more space to viewfinder. despite not having an 18:9 display (as in Honor 9 Lite).. In the context of functionalities; on the top, there’s a key to toggle flash, a portrait mode button, and an HDR toggle mode. On the other end (i.e., bottom), one can find the shutter button, the gallery shortcut, switch camera, filters, and options. Tapping on options takes you to the modes and settings. The Mi A1 has Panorama mode, Watermark on/off switch, manual mode, beautify, square photos, and audio. Using the audio mode, one can click pictures using voice commands.. Top 10 Smartphones under 10,000 INR. For me, unquestionably the Mi A1’s interface is better due to simpleness. But the Honor 9 Lite ‘s camera interface isn’t bad either. That means it comes to personal preference of the user. In the end, the UI doesn’t matter; one won’t like an interface initially but will get used to it. So, the UI is not a question of the debate.. The primary debate is about the quality of the pictures, so let’s jump right into it. We will compare the images clicked in various conditions and finally declare the verdict. In natural light, naturally, any camera works at the best; so let’s start with natural lighting condition.. Both the images in the above picture where taken from the same spot. A huge difference is visible on the first sight. The image clicked from Mi A1 looks closer than Honor 9 lite one. The Mi A1’s photo appears warmer and more natural than Honor 9 Lite. The colors in Honor 9 Lite look under-saturated.. While the Honor 9 Lite fails to produce accurate-to-source colors, it excels at certain areas which Mi A1 fails at.. In this picture, you can see the Mi A1 overexposes the background of the image. On the other end, Honor 9 Lite accurately judges the scene and manages to click a better picture accordingly. In short, the Honor 9 Lite judges the view better at times.. One can see that the dynamic range of the Mi A1 is better than that of Honor 9 Lite. The shadow details and intensity of Lite is obviously better in the Mi A1 which makes the overall frame better comparatively.. In artificial lighting condition, the Honor 9 Lite gives better and punchy colors by reading the scene pretty well. On the other hand, the Mi A1 also produces a similar picture, but on edge, the image becomes smudgy which makes it look dull. So when artificial lighting is in the context, Honor 9 Lite wins by a slight margin.. Like in the first photo, Honor 9 Lite messes with the white balance here as well. Although none of the pictures can be considered the best, Mi A1’s view resembles more natural and pleasing to the eye.. I guess you know the answer to this one. With the telephoto lens, undoubtedly, the photos clicked by Mi A1 in portrait modes will be the best. Because Mi A1 uses its telephoto lens to measure depth and then uses software to blur the background which ends up making the images look excellent. Whereas, the Honor 9 Lite is dependent on camera, lacking the telephoto lens. Hence, the portrait mode photos in good lighting conditions are better in Mi A1 compared to Huawei’s Honor 9 Lite.. When in low lighting conditions, neither of the phones can click pictures in portrait mode. But if we were to choose one, Honor 9 Lite is the one due to a less grainy, clean image.. Neither of the phone is good in low lighting condition. But if compared, Mi A1 is better. In my review of Mi A1, the low-light photos were the only disadvantage of the smartphone. And even though, it surpasses the quality of the competitor.. In the above image of the car, the number plate is clearly visible in the Mi A1’s photo. Similarly, the colors and details of the tree in the second image are better in Mi A1.. In this image too, the quality of Mi A1 shot picture is better. The whole pole is adequately covered in the Mi A1’s view whereas the Honor 9 Lite fails to do that. Also, the yellow color is better visible in the first photo which makes Mi A1 better at detail capturing in low lighting conditions too.. Also Read: Full Specification Review of Xiaomi Mi A1. Due to the 13MP+2MP dual front-facing camera, the selfies in Honor 9 Lite are obviously better than the Mi A1’s 5 MP selfie shooter. so we compared Huawei Honor 9 Lite vs Xiaomi Mi A1 on various points in this article.. We saw that both the cameras are pretty good in the price range. But the Mi A1’s camera is better. Although Honor 9 Lite is better in some context, Mi A1 beats it in most of them.. Now if you wish to buy a smartphone based on selfie, surely buy the Honor 9 Lite.. But with a better dynamic range, portrait mode, and detail capturing ability, I would personally recommend buying the Mi A1 over Honor 9 Lite. That’s the end of this review and one more giant coming this year OnePlus 6 .. Will any other budget smartphone beat Mi A1 this year? To find out subscribe and revisit this site.

Looks so good, you have to keep it on a shelf and admire it from afar.. Huawei Honor 9 Lite 4GB Rating 76/100. Our VerdictAs the year drew to a close, a British anthology series premiered another season of exploring and contemplating the many facets of technology and how they impact our lives. I was reeling off a binge-watch of the season when the Honor 9 Lite dropped (cautiously) in my hands. The name of the series, Black Mirror, essentially means, "the reflection of an unlit computer screen", and when I noticed the all-glass design of the phone, the whole essence of the phrase became more apparent. Honor's latest offering is all-glass-everywhere, perfected in a way that when the tall screen turned off, I was left rethinking my life as I saw myself.. Essentially, the Honor 9 Lite is an stunningly good looking phone, but that's about it. Everything else about the phone is more or less mediocre and something that you would expect from mid-range phones anyway. The new glass design and the quad cameras seems to be just ticks on a checklist to set itself apart from the rest. And while it does manage to grab attention from curious onlookers, you will be left disappointed when actually using the phone as a daily driver.. Huawei Honor 9 Lite 4GB: Detailed Review. There are phones that are practical, and then there are phones that just grab eyeballs without living up to the expectation they set. Take the Google Pixel 2 and the iPhone X in the premium range for example. The Pixel 2 does not boast of a modern design. It's quite retro in the way it's built, as compared to the revolutionary iPhone X which comes in an all-glass body. Between the two, the latter will definitely grab more attention than the former, but at the same time, the Pixel 2 will edge out the iPhone in terms of value for money.. A similar conundrum is now raging in the mid-range segment, now that the Honor 9 Lite is out in the market. It looks like it was carved from a piece of glass which gives a premium feel to the phone. It actually feels quite underpriced for the materials used. But then there are phones like the Lenovo K8 Plus which may have copious amount of plastic in the body, but does the job it's made to do.. We received the 4GB/64GB storage variant and In our review of the Honor 9 Lite, we come to the conclusion that looks are not everything. It's the overall package, and a consistent performance that makes all the difference.. The Honor 9 Lite is an exquisitely crafted smartphone. It is so well made that it feels more like an artifact than a device you would use daily. The glass-enclosed design will remind you of the older Honor 8, but this one feels more compact thanks to the 5.6-inch Univisium display housed in a 6-inch body. There's more screen real estate because of the 18:9 aspect ratio.. Phones are no stranger to glass designs. Before the metal unibody design took over phones, glass was used to set premium phones apart from the rest. Phones with glass bodieshave a snug and smooth hand feel, but they are also prone to damage. It is primarily because of that reason that manufacturers switched to aluminium bodies that gave phones the longevity glass couldn't. Yet, more recently, glass made a comeback, not because phones needed to look better, but for wireless charging. But the Honor 9 Lite, despite having an all-glass body does not have wireless charging. So it's safe to assume, Honor's choice to use glass was for aesthetics only. And in that regard, the phone just oozes a premium feel. But is the glass durable enough to withstand the daily wear and tear phones tend to go through?. Well, Honor certainly thinks the phone can withstand shocks and scratches. Honor claims it has used a 12-layer coating on the glass and a special nano-optical film on top to prevent scratches. Less than a week of using the phone, I had two deep scratches atthe back of the phone which was probably caused by the house-keys I was carrying in my pocket along with the phone.. The Honor 9 Lite is a phone that looks stunning, but if you intend to use it as your daily driver, you will have to slap a case on the back of it. What's the point of having a stunning design if you can't flaunt it to the world?. Nevertheless, the phone itself is quite compact compared to other offerings in its price range. In fact, the dimensions are similar to Honor's other offerings - The Honor 9i and the Honor 7X. In fact, the Honor 9 Lite is much smaller compared to the two. It's not completely bezel-less though as there are distinct borders around the edges and thick upper and lower chins. At the back, the dual camera unit is housed on the top left corner while the fingerprint sensor sits in the upper central coloumn. The power and volume rockers are on the right edge and they are quite responsive and clicky. The phone also relies on a micro-USB port to charge and that's a bummer.. In a sense, the Honor 9 Lite is a culmination of all the design cues from the company since the Honor 9i launched in India. Honor has perfected the colour offerings as well and the 9 Lite comes in three beautifully crafted colours - Saphire Blue, Glacier Gray, and Midnight Black.. Taller, 18:9 displays are now a common sight in smartphones. It took surprisingly less time for the technology to trickle down to lower price segments but 2017 saw phones across a broad price range launch with the new display formats. The Honor 9 Lite is the fourth offering from Honor in India featuring the 18:9 display. For one, because of its proprietary chipset, the Honor 9i is one of the few mid-range phones to offer an FHD+ (2160x1080p) resolution. That means, the phone packs a lot more pixels in the 5.6-inch panel thanmost, making photos and videos look vibrant and full of colours.. The display also didn't have the cool blueish tint that other Honor phones have. In fact, I found the Honor 9 Lite's display has a more accurate white point. You can play around with the colour temperature though and Honor also gives you the option to dial down the resolution to 720p if required.. Yet, one of the major problems the display will face is incompatibility with apps. Not all content is calibrated for taller displays, yet. So some Android games like Injustice 2 will have menus cropped when you go full-screen, although Netflix and YouTube should work fine.. The display had a measured luminescence rating of 570 nits which is quite good for the price. Although, because this is an IPS LCD panel, you won't get the deep contrasts on the Honor 9 Lite. As a result, while the brightness is enough to be legible under direct sunlight, content might seem a little bland.. As a subsidiary of Huawei, Honor devices have the honour (get it?) to use the company's proprietary chipsets. The Honor 9 Lite is no exception. But weirdly enough, all the newly launched mid-range phones by Honor are powered by the same chipset - The HiSilicon Kirin 659. Like the Honor 7X and the Honor 9i, the Honor 8 Lite too is offered in 3GB and 4GB RAM variants with 32GB and 64GB of storage respectively. Even weirder is the margin of difference the three phones had on benchmark tests. While there wasn't much separating the phones on AnTuTu or Geekbench 4, 3D Mark, which calculates graphical prowess of the phone, gave drastically low scores.. After scratching our heads for sometime, we figured it could be that the chipset's drivers are not optimised for Vulcan API which is enabled by default on Android Oreo. Futuremark notes on its website that "devices that shipped with early Vulkan drivers may have performance and stability issues in this test. Vulkan performance can be much lower than expected and the test can crash on devices with underdeveloped Vulkan drivers.". Nevertheless, real world usage will show no difference. The phone did not slow down even after opening a lot of apps in one go. There are also no drops in framerates whileplaying games like Asphalt 8: Nitro and loading times are impressive. The phone feels faster for its price of Rs 14,999 and that speaks a lot for mid-range phones where the raw performance is not always the priority.. The phone is also optimised to run quite fast. It takes around 35 seconds to boot which is commendable and the fingerprint sensor works blazing fast. Overall, we felt the phone is quite fast for the price it retails for, and that should be an encouraging sign of the phones to come this year.. The highlight of the Honor 9 Lite isits Quad-camera setup. Honor has done this overkill before with the Honor 9i and now, it has trickled down the novelty to a price where dual cameras are just starting to come in. There are two cameras on the front, and two at the back. On both sides, the primary camera is of 13-megapixel resolution and there is an additional 2-megapixel sensor to capture depth information. The twin cameras on both sides are mostly for portrait mode. Yes, portrait mode is present on both the front and the rear camera. But based on what we saw, the cameras are not that impressive. They dotake quality images under perfect light, but it's not that consistent.. Under direct sunlight, the colours are somewhat faded and whitened out. You will notice the blue sky has become white around the edges while in the center, the saturation is way too low. Yes, it was a rare blue sky on a cold winter afternoon in Delhi that day.. If you take photos against harsh sunlight, expect a loss in focus and soft-touches to objects. What's commendable though is the lack of shadows in the photo under such tricky lighting.. The whitening effect of the camera becomes more prominent in the photo above. The walls should have a yellowish glow considering its peak afternoon outside and the white balance is always warmer in such situations. But the phone whitewashes the walls to an even whiter shade than it should, for aesthetics?. Having said that, under indoor lighting, the camera can reproduce vibrant and punchy colours, which is what Honor's cameras are famous for. Even then, we faced some difficulty to bring objects into focus. A quick shot will most likely be out of focus. It is only when you spend some time composing the shot will you get decent results.. Low light shots are as you would expect from a mid-range phone. Also, it takes significantly more time to focus and then some more time to process the photo after shooting. But the end result isn't as impressive. There is some amount of noise reduction and sharpening that happens, but you won't make out finer details from a photo taken under low light.. As for the portrait mode, the Honor 9 Lite will aggressively blur the background, so much so, that the main object in focus sometimes loses detail. The portrait mode also makes photos overexposed which is never a good thing.. The story of the front camera is also the same. There is the same odd whitening effect prevalent in selfies, even more so, because of the beautify effects. The portrait mode from the front camera has the same issue of overexposing the shot.. To be honest, the camera is better than what phones at that price offer, but if you are buying the phone simply for the camera, it's better to think again.. A phone that's coming out in the beginning of 2018 shouldn't come with anything less than the latest version of Android, and the Honor 9 Lite doesn't disappoint in that regard. The phone comes with EMUI 8.0 based on Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box even when new phones launching in January are still running older versions of Android.. Having said that, the interface is nowhere near as light as stock Android. It's still faster than the previous EMUI 5.0 as the new version takes advantage of the lightweight nature of Android Oreo. It has also cut down on some system animations and now the UI feels much smoother. That could also be because the Honor 9 Lite uses the F2FS (Flash-based files storage) system that prevents the phone from slowing down over time apart from increasing app loading times.. The UI offers a new way to navigate the phone using a navigation dock. It's like an on-screen trackball that allow users to go back, go to the homescreen or hit the recents menu. It's quite nifty for one-handed use.. There are a bunch of pre-loaded apps including a second Gallery App, a separate mail and music app, and the likes, which may make sense in the Chinese market (where the phone originally launched), but in India, it's just taking up precious space. Apart from these, you get the usual Honor suite of apps.. There are a couple of India-centric features on the phone as well - Paytm is integrated in the software and there is a dedicated bike mode that prevents the phone from buzzing while you are riding.. Android Oreo also brings new features like picture-in-picture, deeper notification management and more.. Latest Android is always welcome on a phone, but considering how heavily customised the interface is, it's remains to be seen whether future updates will be rolled out in time.. The Honor 9 Lite sports a 3,000mAh battery which is just about enough to last you through the day. The phone lasted around 7 hours on PC Mark's battery test which is commendable. We also used the phone like a daily driver with generous amounts of social media browsing, playing YouTube videos, and browsing the web apart from half an hour of gaming and copious use of the camera to take photos.. The phone uses a micro-USB port to charge which is disappointing considering how the USB Type-C is fast becoming the convention across devices. There is support for fast charging and "smart battery saving"technology which essentially monitors active apps running in the background, manage screen-timeout and location settings to extend the battery life.. The Honor 9 Lite will score full marks in terms of design but lose out on durability. It will impress with the number of cameras on the body, but will disappoint with the image quality. The phone will again feel fast and smooth, but Honor's track record of providing timely updates is questionable. However, for the price of Rs 14,999, the Lenovo K8 Plus is also a good option to keep in mind. It may not have the attractive design of the Honor 9 Lite, but it more than makes up for it in terms of performance and camera quality. The higher variant of the Honor 9 Lite will go up against the Xiaomi Mi A1 and its own Honor 7X. Between the three, it will come down to the interface you are used to, the most and the build quality. 4GB of RAM should more than compensate for the heavily modded EMUI interface and take it at par with the Mi A1..

Huawei Honor 9 Lite Review: Too Many Selling Points On A Single Device. On December 2, Huawei launched a very attractive smartphone named the Huawei Honor 9 Lite aka Huawei Honor 9 Youth Edition. As the name suggests, this is the lightened variant of the original Honor 9 made for young customers. This simply means it should come with all the latest trends, sport a stylish look, and priced too low. The Honor 9 Lite has all the aforementioned features. Besides the full-screen, it also comes with a quad-camera module. What else young people need? That’s why we are sure this phone will show good sales performance. The lowest variant with a 3+32GB memory option is available for 1199 yuan ($182), the 4+32GB model is sold for 1499 yuan ($228), and the 4+64GB version is at 1799 yuan ($273).. 1 Huawei Honor 9 Lite Appearance 2 Huawei Honor 9 Lite Performance 3 Huawei Honor 9 Lite Camera 4 Huawei Honor 9 Lite Battery 5 Conclusion. The Huawei Honor 9 Lite sports a 5.65-inch full-screen with a resolution of 2160 x 1080 pixels (FHD+) and an aspect ratio of 18:9. Thanks to it, we get our hands on a housing identical to a regular 5.2-inch screen. So be sure single-hand operations are implemented with no additional efforts. Plus, we get a larger screen with a better viewing experience.. This phone uses a double-sided 2.5D glass body, while the back also uses a 12-layers nano-technology to provide a better mirror effect. Young users should like this effect.. However, Huawei has shown it adopts quite different full-screen technology placing a home button below the screen. The Huawei Honor 9 Lite has put the fingerprint reader under this button. It works quite fast and accurately providing down to 0.25 seconds of unlock speed.. There is still a 3.5mm audio jack located on the bottom along with the micro USB port, a microphone hole, and a speaker .. Like all the latest phones launched by Huawei, this one comes with an EMUI 8.0 pre-installed. It is an intelligent software based on Android 8.0 Oreo. This software also comes with an underlying depth optimization, optimized system cache, and defragmentation.. As for hardware, the Huawei Honor 9 Lite sports a Kirin 659 octa-core chip based on a 16nm process node that also provides a good power saving performance.. This chip has been tested via Honor of Kings. Recently, the company opened the high frame rate mode, and the Honor 9 Lite shows 30fps. So we should state this handset and the Kirin 659 is capable of providing great gaming performance.. Probably young customers will like more the quad-camera feature rather than the full-screen that can be found on any modern smartphone. There are the same 2+13MP dual-camera modules placed on both front and back. These sensors come with an aperture of f/2.0 and PDAF.. As you understand, the 13MP lens is responsible for the imaging process, while the 2MP lens provides the high-demanded bokeh effect. This statement is true for both the front and rear cameras. Thanks to them the phone is capable of taking good shots under the direct sunlight. Moreover, when taking photos via the portrait mode, this handset provides a shooting experience close to SLR blurring. But it would be unfair to say the Honor 9 Lite takes similar photos in low-light conditions.. There is a standard 3000mAh battery under the hood. This capacity should be sufficient for a daily use. To understand whether it’s so, we used a 70-minute test. The first 15 minutes we were reading news. It consumed only 2% of power. The next 15 minutes were spent on a social networking. It consumed only 3% of power. Then, we were watching an HD video online for 20 minutes that consumed 7% of power. A 20-minute pastime via the Honor of Kings consumed another 7%. So we have all reasons to think this handset is capable of providing a day-lasting battery life.. As for charging, it comes with an adapter supporting 5V / 2A 10W. When tested it for charging, the first 90 minutes of the whole process showcased a stable performance. After the first 30 minutes, it reached 33% of electricity. Charging for an hour brought it to 62%. After 90 minutes it reached 88% and switched to a trickle charge. So it took about 120 minutes to charge from 0% to 100%.. The Huawei Honor 9 Lite comes with a more attractive design than many thousand-yuan machines available in the market. It sports a double-sided 2.5D glass housing unlike the metal- or plastic-made phones. Apart from this, it is the first quad-camera smartphone of the Honor line that makes it even more eye-catching. And we also should recall the full-screen technology that is required for any modern handset.. I'm a Tech Enthusiastic and CEO of Get Droid Tips. Leave a Comment Cancel Reply.
