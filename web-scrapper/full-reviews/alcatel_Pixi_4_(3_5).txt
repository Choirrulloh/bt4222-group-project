Yo hace 3 meses, Me conseguí este Smartphone en Claro Honduras, Y la verdad, Iba muy bien, Las aplicaciones basicas los agarraba bien, Osea, Los programas predeterminados. Pero poco a poco que le instalas ciertas cosas como por ejemplo: Whatsapp, Facebook (Normal), Messenger (Normal), y YouTube, No los soportaba muchisimo que digamos, Ya que a veces al mirar un video en YouTube, el video se ralentiza, Si queremos cambiar de video, Osea, Lo agarra pero seria un milagro que lo agarrara excelentisimo. OK, Entiendo que es un telefono que es para gente no muy "Exigente", pero yo tenia un Bmobile AX620, el cual si no mal recuerdo (Tengo que investigar de este telefono) Tenia casi las mismas especificaciones, Osea, que rayos? Yo pensé que era por el telefono, Pero en realidad el Procesador MediaTek MT6572M (Quad-Core) Que Pueda soportar el Android 5.1 (No pide mucho pero para este telefono no es muy recomendable), puede llegar a niveles de lag muy grandes. Yo en mi caso a mi telefono le he instalado anteriormente Facebook al telefono (Normal) Es increiblemente la molestia del espacio (Se me llena rapido, Ni moviendolo a la tarjeta). Pero igual, Con una particion lo arregla jeje. Este telefono falla en esas cosas de particion, O a menos que usen una tarjeta sd que no esté en uso (Root xD). En resumen, Es un telefono dedicado a esas personas que no piden aplicaciones y juegos asi como Clash Of Clans, COD:BOZ, en otras palabras, Un Telefono que sale mejor para personas con bajo presupuesto y con baja mentalidad para instalar programas al telefono, Solo le instalamos Whatsapp y Actualizamos YouTube, y Listeticks! Ya tenemos nuestro telefono de gama baja jeje. Aunque en serio, este telefono puede fallar muchisimo a los usuarios que se han acostumbrado a otros telefonos como Samsung S5, HTC One M8, osea, No se pasen de la raya con este telefono. Resultado: Un telefono que les servirá a aquellas personas que quieren empezar a usar este tipo de telefonos (Smartphone). Es sencillo, Pero ahorras para comprarte uno mejor xD :v. Este equipo para el precio que tiene es, como se dice vulgarmente, bastante "apañador", es un celular dedicado para los que no son exigentes con los Smartphones, pero de un rendimiento más que aceptable con aplicaciones cotidianas como WhatsApp, Facebook e Instagram. Totalmente recomendado para el precio que tiene.. quiero mas memoria 32 GB de almacenamiento interno, procesador dual-core a 1GHz, 980MB de RAM, es un smartphone económico con pantalla HVGA de 4.5, cámara principal de 5 megapixels, y Android 9.0 Lollipop.. no te dejes engañar este dispositivo es sólo basura, nada de lo que dicen es cierto, tengo uno tengo 3 meses con él y desde el primer mes comenzó a fallarme, hoy ya la pantalla esta quebrada no por golpes ni nada por el estilo sino por la fuerza que tengo que hace en el botón para encender la pantalla cada vez que se apaga, a veces se reinicia o se marca solo sin que le ponga un dedo en la pantalla, en verdad me arrepiento de haberlo comprado y sobre todo que no halla un centro de servicio aquí para exigir la devolución de mi dinero y poder comprarme otro de otra marca y mejor que esta basura.. WOW! 3.5' pulgadas, 512mg de ram, 4gb de rom y puede correr lollipop ? en serio, me imagino que al comienzo te ira bien, pero apenas le comienses a descargar aplicaciones se ira poniendo tonto, porque no creo que un procesador dual-core a 1GHz pueda correr tan fluido llolipop... Me parece una apuesta muy interesante, yo me compraria uno para tenerlo de smartphone secundario.. Ver todas las Opiniones del Alcatel Pixi 4 (3.5) - Total de opiniones de usuarios: 8.

Home Other Phone Models Alcatel Alcatel Pixi 4 Cases. The Alcatel Pixi 4 is a range of android based smart phones due to be released in 2016 featuring the popular Android operating system. The Alcatel Pixi 4 range offers a selection of screen sizes and specification to ensure there is something for everyone, from the casual user all the way to the more experienced android enthusiast.. Here at 32nd Shop we understand how important your Alcatel Pixi 4 is. Our phones are a vital part in almost all of our daily lives and many of us would feel lost without our phone in our pocket or handbag. We now seem to use them for everything, from snapping photographs and sharing them with friends and family to catching up on our favorite TV Programmes. This makes our phone even more vulnerable to damage as they are consistently in and out of pockets or in the palm of our hands waiting to slip from our grasp at the worst possible moment, as such we understand the desire to protect our phone from the dangers of daily use.. We have all experienced that terrifying moment, losing grip on our device for just a millisecond only to watch it fall helplessly to the ground wishing that it had some form of protection. Any drops could easily cause disastrous damage such as cracking its sensitive glass screen or damaging its high tech circuit boards, and the cost of repairs can quickly add up. As the saying goes, prevention is always better than a cure and fitting your Pixi 4 with the best case is the simplest, most practical way of preventing your phone from getting smashed and could quite easily save you a large repair bill in the future.. Our huge range of Alcatel Pixi 4 cases all provide long lasting protection at a competitive price point without compromising on style, usability or quality. Whether you are after a heavy duty cover to protect your phone, or something more stylish that enhances your phone we have a full range of colourful Alcatel Pixi 4 cases that will suit your preference. All of our Pixi 4 cases are available in a wide array of colours and designs making them an ideal present for any mobile phone aficionado..
