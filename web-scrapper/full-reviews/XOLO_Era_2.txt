There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 1.0 out of 5 stars Shocked by Amazon and xolo. More than xolo I am extremely dissatisfied and shocked with Amazon. Being an international brand, a certain level of quality is expected but this is the worst example being portrayed by Amazon. This is the worst ever product being sold at Amazon. The product is a total waste. Infact it wastes up emotions, energy, time and electricity also. The phone initially was not delivered on time, then I wanted to return it but it was not accepted, later the phone started behaving absurdly even though it was not being used. The phone gets heated, the phone hangs, the phone switches off absurdly, the phone is extremely slow, this phone has very poor battery performance. The phone is unbelievably weird. One should rather throw his money in a ditch than buying this phone. Also this time spent on writing this review is wasted but this is being done so that others are not duped as I've been by Amazon and xolo. Pls don't ever buy this phone. Also, someone at Amazon Pls take a note of my review, you have lost one family by selling this phone to them.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Good and affordable 4g smartphone for light users. If you are not into playing too many games and do not add too many apps, then it works without a hitch. Camera and sound quality are ok. Battery lasts for a complete day, even when I use whatsapp call for almost an hour. But it did hang and the screen went completely blank twice when I used whatsapp calling. It comes back to normal when the other person cuts the call. This was the only issue that I have faced. There are a ton of preinstalled apps, but most of them can be deleted. It may not be suitable for people who wants to install many apps.. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars Stay way from the product..Buggy OS installed. I Received this phone on 8th of May. The Phone looks decent for the price range but will not last long 1) Built is too delicate 2) They claim the camera to be 5.0 mega pixel. But the quality of the photos are not good. It seems to be of photos taken from camera with 1.0Mega Pixel. 3) Messages are not getting recived properly. Looks like amazon has given me a buggy product or the product itself buggy (Buggy Software) 4) Video player used to play video is not of good quality Overall i'm not happy with the product for the given price range..

These are the two major chip manufacturers who are dominant in the processor market. Recently, Intel tried their hand at manufacturing mobile processors and Xolo Mobiles were the first Indian company they chose as partners to launch smartphones powered by Intel chips. Xolo is a subsidiary of Lava Mobiles, which is one of the largest mobile phone makers in India. Xolo Era 2 is one of their newer offerings which was launched in October 2016.. Xolo is known for making affordable smartphones with mid-range specifications and premium looks. The Xolo Era 2 is a stylish looking smartphone which runs on a quad-core processor and supports 4G bands of India. It is a dual-SIM device which features 4G connectivity and supports VOLTE. The Xolo Era 2 is available at a price of Rs. Let us take a closer look at this phone.. The Xolo Era 2 is encased in a plastic body featuring a matte finish on the removable back panel. It provides access to the removable battery, the dual SIMs, and the microSD card slot. The back panel is rather bare, with only the Xolo branding in the center. The 5.0-megapixel camera is located in the top-left corner with a single LED flash beside it.. The camera is placed in a vertical pill-shaped metallic accent. There are metallic accents over the top and bottom edges of the phone as well. These provide a nice contrast to the matte black body. The micro-USB charging port and the 3.5mm headphone jack sit on the top edge. The bottom edge is bare, except for the primary microphone. The left edge is completely clean.. The volume rocker and the power button are located on the left edge of the phone. Over at the front, the 5.0” TFT LCD screen dominates. The earpiece sits at the top of the display and is flanked by a 5.0-megapixel selfie camera with its own flash. The three touch capacitive touch buttons are located below the display and they are not backlit.. The Xolo Era 2 has a 5.0” TFT LCD display with a resolution of 480 x 854 pixels with a pixel density of 196 PPI. The display is well-saturated with ample brightness and decent viewing angles.. The display is highly reflective and that affects its sunlight legibility. The middling resolution on a 5.0” inch display also takes its toll on the sharpness. The display appears soft in some scenarios.. The Xolo Era 2 sports a 5.0-megapixel camera at the back as well as the front. Both the cameras have their own single LED flash. Pictures from the primary camera clicked in daylight under ideal lighting conditions turn out clear and well-lit. But the camera struggles in indoor or low-light conditions.. Noise begins to creep in and in extreme cases, the colors smudge into each other. The front 5.0-megapixel camera takes good selfies in good light. In low light, the single LED flash manages to light up the photo well as the subjects are well within the range of the flash. The same camera is used for video calls and the call quality is decent.. The Xolo Era 2 is powered by a quad-core Spreadtrum SC9832A processor running at 1.3 GHz accompanied by a Mali-400MP3 GPU. It is supported by 1GB RAM and 8GB built-in storage capacity. The storage can be increased up to 32GB via the microSD card slot. The phone works on Indian 4G networks and supports VOLTE calling on supported networks.. Both the SIM slots support 4G and the phone features dual standby. The 2350mAh battery powers the phone for a long time between two charging cycles. The 8GB storage tends to fill up fast and the phone slows down considerably after that happens. The Xolo Era 2 also supports Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth V4.0, FM radio and A-GPS wireless connectivity.. Bluetooth V4.0 and Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n with A-GPS support.. Camera quality not up to the mark.. The Xolo Era 2 is a wonderful mid-range device which accomplishes daily tasks without breaking a sweat. The 5.0-megapixel selfie camera is the USP here. The selfie flash makes it an even more attractive to potential buyers. Overall, it is good value for money well spent.. Xolo Era 2 Full Specifications. 146.5 x 73 x 9.2 mm. GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900. 1.4 µm pixel size, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, panorama. HSPA 21.1/5.76 Mbps, LTE Cat4 150/50 Mbps. 8 GB ROM, 1 GB RAM.
