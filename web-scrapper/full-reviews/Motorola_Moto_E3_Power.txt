Please ask the question in above box. What is meant by NFC chipset?. Near field communication, a technology that allows the short-range wireless intercommunication of mobile phones and other electronic devices for purposes such as making payments.. NFC stands for Near Field Communication.. Which one is better Redmi 4 or Moto E3 power?. If you are going forward for durability and the toughness of the mobile phones, then go for Moto E3 Power. But if you want to have more features and configuration for the same price, then you can always have the Redmi phones.. Moto has Google Stock Android OS. Also, its memory is very less (16GB), whereas Redmi comes with 32 GB and 64GB. Moto is water and dust resistant whereas Redmi is not. Also, Moto is very good in durability and toughness.. So the bottom line is, for durability with bit compromise of features and configuration, you can go for Moto. And if you require good configuration with bit compromise of durability and toughness, then go for Redmi.. Not used Redmi 4 till now. But as per my experience with Mi phones, it should be better. E3 would stand right behind Redmi 4.. redmi note 4 better than moto e power. Moto 3 power is the best phone.. Moto phones don't support HDMI, so MHL and Slimport are not supported. Casting via chrome cast is the solution for most stock Android devices.. No, it does not support MHL or slim port.. hey mahesh! as a moto E3 power user i am little bit disappointed, yeah it supports JIO 4G network but didn't offer a video call on the LTE network! mark my word in future they are not going to update the firmware of this device for Video calls, if you want to use this services you must think for another handset. camera is also not powerful as compared to other phones in this segment. in my point of view this is just an elementary handset in today scenario.. battery backup is very fantastic ..... front camera is very superb .... other than company this phone facility at least above 11000 ...... so fantastic mobile Moto E3 Power....by s.murugadoss ...........tiruvarurur dist .......7339019999.

The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. Quad-core, 1000 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit.

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Moto E3 Power is priced at Rs. It will be going on sale exclusively via Flipkart. It packs a large 3500mAh battery. When Motorola made its comeback to the Indian market in 2014, the budget-friendly Moto E played a major role in its success. The company received a massive response to the first Moto E launch, leading Flipkart servers to crash and units to go out of stock within seconds. Motorola followed the same strategy with its second-generation Moto E ( Review ) but didn't quite achieve the same level of success in India thanks to stronger competition.. Now, post takeover, Lenovo is launching the third-generation Moto E. There is however a change this time; the model that is launching is called Moto E3 Power , and it's a variant of the Moto E3 for India. The Moto E3 Power is definitely superior on paper thanks to its bigger battery, and twice the amount of memory and inbuilt storage. But will that be enough to take on the likes of some popular budget smartphones in the country? Only time will tell. We spent some time with the new Moto E3 Power at its launch event in New Delhi, and here are our first impressions.. One of the biggest highlights of the Moto E3 Power is its large 3500mAh battery, and this is being marketed heavily by the company. Making the deal even sweeter, Lenovo will ship a 10W charger in the Moto E3 Power's box. The phone supports rapid charging, which means plugging it in for 15 minutes will give you up to five hours of battery life, according to the company.. The Moto E3 Power has a removable back cover that opens up to reveal two SIM slots as well as a microSD card slot. The company has gone with a removable battery on the Moto E3 Power, which looks like a welcome change from most phones today which have non-removable batteries.. The new Moto E3 Power definitely looks a lot like the first-generation Moto E with speaker grilles both above and below the display. The 5-inch screen makes this phone feel taller than the original Moto E which had a 4.3-inch display as well as the Moto E (Gen 2) which had a 4.5-inch display. The front of the new phone is plain with no branding, while the rear sports the iconic Moto logo just below the camera. We liked the textured rear panel and the metal frame, which both give the Moto E3 Power a sturdy feel as well as decent grip.. The volume and power buttons are on the right, while the left is blank. The 3.5mm audio jack is on top, and the Micro-USB charging port is on the bottom. At around 154 grams, the phone feels slightly heavy for its size, and with a 9.5mm side profile, it's also quite thick.. In terms of display, Lenovo at the launch touted that the Moto E3 Power sports the "biggest and brightest" display ever for a Moto E-series phone. The E3 Power sports a 5-inch HD (720x1280-pixel) IPS display which is certainly an improvement over the previous generation's qHD (540x960-pixel) resolution. That means that despite its bigger display, the Moto E3 Power also sports a higher pixel density which now stands at 294ppi. We were however surprised to see no reinforced glass. This was one feature that both previous Moto E models offered. During our limited time with the device, the display on the Moto E3 Power seemed crisp and did a decent job for the most part. We liked the viewing angles but were however slightly disappointed with the display's brightness which might be an issue under direct sunlight.. Lenovo has gone for onscreen buttons instead of capacitive ones for Android's Home, Recents, and Back navigation controls. The physical volume and power buttons placed on the right offer decent tactile feel. Much like previous Moto handsets, the Moto E3 Power will also sport a nano-coating which is claimed to protect it from rain splashes.. The Moto E3 Power runs near-stock Android 6.0 Marshmallow with very minimal tweaks from the company. The unit that we played with had the Google Now launcher which was set as the default. There are not many third-party apps installed on the phone which is good for users as they get the most out of the 16GB of onboard storage. The phone supports storage expansion via a microSD card (up to 32GB). Additionally, Lenovo is also offering two years of free photo storage on the Google Photos app.. This new phone is powered by a 64-bit 1GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6735P processor, and has 2GB of RAM. For those familiar with the Moto E series of smartphones, the previous Moto E model was powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor. In the time we spent with a Moto E3 Power demo unit, we found that the smartphone was responsive to touch inputs and quick enough with multitasking. Stay tuned for when we put this phone through its paces for a detailed review.. One of the biggest improvements on the Moto E3 Power is in the camera department. This phone sports an 8-megapixel rear camera with LED flash, with features like 720p HD video capture and burst mode. It also has a 5-megapixel front-facing camera with a beautification mode.. The camera app on the Moto E3 Power launched quickly after tapping on the icon. In our short time with the device, we found that images taken under normal lighting seemed crisp, with good amounts of detail. On zooming in, we however saw pixellation in the corners. The front-facing camera took decent images though we will reserve our verdict on the cameras until we get a chance to test them under varied conditions.. In terms of connectivity, the Moto E3 Power offers Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, A-GPS, Bluetooth v4.0, 3G, GPRS/ EDGE, and 4G LTE (Cat. It also supports VoLTE and can take advantage of Reliance Jio's network. Sensors include a proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, and an accelerometer.. 7,999, Lenovo's Moto E3 Power seems like a decent overall package. The device will be available exclusively through Flipkart from midnight on Monday with plenty of launch offers.. Amit Boni, General Manager, Motorola Mobility at the launch event revealed that there are over 3 million Moto E users in India, which is a testament to the popularity of the previous two models. However, at its price point, the new Moto E3 Power will be competing against some of the most popular phones in the country, including the Xiaomi Redmi 3S which is priced lower at Rs. 6,999 and offers better features such as an all-metal body and a massive 4100mAh battery.. The new Moto E3 Power will also be challenged by Lenovo's very own Vibe K5 Plus and Vibe K5 which are already available in India priced at Rs. On being asked whether the Moto E3 Power will pose a problem for existing Vibe models in the Indian market, Sudhin Mathur, Executive Director, Lenovo MBG India stated that the sub-Rs. 10,000 price segment is too big and there's "something for every phone".. The Moto E3 Power brings a lot of upgrades and improvements compared to its predecessors but is it worth buying, especially with competition as fierce as it is?

Seller(s) of Motorola Moto E3 Power Latest Price Flipkart Rs. Moto by Lenovo for the first time has gone with MediaTek processor with the Moto E3 Power.The phone as it looks like focuses on providing excellent battery life. That could be one of the reason Moto chose to go with a low end MediaTek chipset to make sure it does not consume more power.. The look and feel of the device comes from the recently launched Moto G4 Play with plastic body but solid built and good to hold. Also the smaller form factor ensures the devices to be easily used single handedly. The display of the Moto E3 Power is a 5 inch HD with a resolution of 1280x720 pxiels and that gives the display a total pixel density of 294PPI which does sound decent in terms of sharpness.. Running inside the phone is a MediaTek Mt6735P Quad Core chipset clocked at 1GHz and combined along is thankfully 2GB of RAM. The processor being just about average in performance has also been under clocked to get more juice out of it.

Apart from that we have standard Bluetooth and WiFi connectivity as well.. For a price of around Rs.8000, even though Moto is betting big on it's massive battery , the Moto E3 Power does not make sense at all as it has a major competitor Xiaomi Redmi 3s and Redmi 3s Prime around the same price. The latter two phones offer much better performance and an even bigger battery along side other essential features ..

Was this review helpful? 0 0. By Parush Anand on March 26, 2017 | Verified Owner. Bought this phone at a 10% off from Flipkart @ Rs 7200. This is my secondary phone basically bought to use my secondary Sims. But the phone sometimes gets switched off itself while it is in my pocket. I really get annoyed with that. Apart from that as I am an apple user the touch response is pretty dull when compared to an apple. I suggest not to buy this as you have a lot of other options these days rather than this in this price range.. Display size is appropriate Camera is good. Heats a lot Gets switched off automatically Touch is not so good. Was this review helpful? 0 0. By Pramey Popat on March 28, 2017 | Verified Owner. Writing review after 5 months of usage. Best in class phone in this price range.. 1) Good battery backup of 3500mah works absolutely fabulous. 2) Nil or very very less heating. 3) Best camera in this price range. 4) comes with fast charging which isn't available in any other phone in this price range.. 1) earphones coming with this product aren't very comfortable and pain feels after average usage of 30 minutes. 3) Not upgradable to Android 7.0.(till this date).

Motorola Moto E3 ‘Power’ release might still be on, Android 6.0 obviously in tow. Adrian Diaconescu June 28, 2016 11:35 am. The low-cost Android smartphone landscape has changed a great deal lately, thanks primarily to increasingly ambitious Chinese OEMs that are pushing the entry-level standards higher and higher.. Budget specialists like Huawei , Xiaomi or Meizu , with little focus on profit margins, have made it nearly impossible for Samsung, HTC, Sony or LG to compete in the sub-$100 and even sub-$200 market segments.. But does the same go for Motorola, the uncrowned champion of the uber-affordable niche in the past few. years? Not with Lenovo at the helm, a larger, faster than ever yet inexpensive new Moto G out and about, plus a Moto E3 Power seemingly incoming.. We were almost ready to give up on the once oft-rumored 5-inch sequel to the early 2015-released 4.5-inch second-gen Moto E… when a Wi-Fi certification of an XT1706 caught our eye earlier today. That’s exactly the model number we expect to follow the XT15xx, and surprisingly enough, the Wi-Fi Alliance reveals the official product name as the aforementioned Moto E3 Power.. It’s etched in stone the device will run Android 6.0 Marshmallow out the box (duh), and according to past benchmarks, other specs include a quad-core MediaTek SoC, 2GB RAM, and 8 and 5MP cams..
