The rugged LG X4 Plus goes official with Hi-Fi DAC and LG Pay. by Williams Pelegrin January 19, 2018. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. LG unveiled the X4 Plus in its home country of South Korea. The phone features mid-range specifications, MIL-STD 810G certification, and a Hi-Fi DAC. The X4 is available through South Korean carriers for $280 outright.. While LG figures out what it wants to do with its flagship smartphones for 2018, the company announced the rugged X4 Plus for the mid-range market.. Sporting an aluminum build, the X4 Plus features a 13 MP camera that sits above the circular fingerprint sensor. Around front is a 5 MP selfie shooter and the 5.3-inch display with 720p resolution.. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 425 and 2 GB of RAM power the X4 Plus, with the 32 GB of built-in storage and microSD card slot giving folks some flexibility for their storage needs. The phone also features a 3,000 mAh battery, which should play nice with the processor and display resolution to net you all-day usage.. Unfortunately, the X4 Plus runs Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box, which makes me sad. I get that the phone is a mid-range device, but Oreo has now been available for months and introduces quite a few improvements over Nougat.. Is LG launching a new V30 variant at MWC 2018? (Update: LG official confirms). Original story (01/19): LG has certainly picked an interesting time to undergo a transitional period. With ailing sales and losses spiralling into the hundreds of millions, the South Korean OEM recently revealed that it is …. The software might be updated, but the X4 Plus does have at least one advantage — the X4 Plus is MIL-STD 810G. This means the phone will stand up to temperature extremes, drops, and other factors that the clumsy among us will appreciate. The rating does not mean the phone is water- and dust-resistant, so remember that if you want to use it by the pool.. Another nifty feature is the Hi-Fi digital-analog converter that allows for up to 32-bit 192 kHz audio output. Finally, the X4 Plus supports LG Pay, the company’s mobile payment system that has been available in South Korea since last June. LG confirmed it will launch LG Pay in the US by the end of June , but not with the X4 Plus.. That is because the X4 Plus looks to stay in South Korea and be available through the country’s carriers for around $280. We will keep an eye out to see whether the phone makes its way overseas..

Affordable LG X4+ goes official with rugged design, Hi-Fi DAC, LG Pay support. Adrian Diaconescu January 19, 2018 3:53 am. While LG Mobile continues to consider its high-end 2018 options , reportedly going back to the drawing board to try to find a unique selling proposition for a G7 flagship that’s now expected out no earlier than April, a mid-range X4+ has just snuck into the company’s domestic market.. Although unveiled with minimal fanfare for all three Korean wireless service providers, LG’s first new phone of the year has quite a few things going for it. The 5.3-incher is obviously no powerhouse, packing a modest quad-core Snapdragon 425 processor coupled with 2GB RAM, but a Hi-Fi DAC is not something you typically see offered in the sub-$300 price bracket.. The LG X4+ therefore promises the “highest level of high resolution music”, supporting up to 32-bit 192 kHz sound reproduction. In addition to high-resolution 32-bit audio, the “exceptionally durable” handset aims to stand out with military-grade protection against everything from drops to vibration, extreme temperatures, thermal shock, and humidity.. Less bulky than most rugged devices out there, the LG X4+ tips the scales at 172 grams and measures 8.6mm in thickness, rocking a premium aluminum backplate that hides a decently sized 3,000mAh battery.. The final selling point is undoubtedly LG Pay support, previously included only on the high-end G6 , although if the X4+ ever expands internationally, odds are you won’t be able to use the chaebol’s digital wallet platform.. The rest of the features are nothing to write home about, from 13 and 5MP rear and front cameras to Android 7.0 Nougat software, 720p resolution for the 5.3-inch 16:9 IPS screen, 32GB internal storage, and microSD card slot. But the LG X4+ may just be affordable enough to make a few waves, at KRW 300,000, equating to roughly $280.. Android , LG , News , X4 , X4 Plus. Android , LG , News , X4 , X4 Plus.

LG X4+ unveiled in Korea: a MIL-STD rated phone with 32-bit DAC. LG Android Announcement. Each of the phones in LGs X-series has a special skill. The new LG X4+ is rugged with a MIL-STD-810G certification, similar to the X venture though at a lower price point.. The X4+ puts battery life ahead of performance with 3,000mAh capacity and a Snapdragon 425 chipset (with 2GB of RAM, 32GB storage). It runs Android 7.0 Nougat on a 5.3 IPS display (720p resolution, nothing to write home about).. This isnt a simple low-end affair. The phone boasts a high-quality DAC with support for 32-bit 192kHz audio. Or you could listen to FM radio instead. LG Pay is also supported for when youre back in civilization  complete with a fingerprint reader on the back for authentication.. And when out in the wild, you can shoot 13MP photos with the rear camera and 5MP wide-angle selfies (100°).. The LG X4+ will be available on the three major Korean carriers at a price of KRW 300,000 ($280/230) with a choice between Moroccan Blue and Lavender Violet for the exterior.. Its not clear if it will get a western launch, but in case it doesnt you can consider the more capable (but more expensive) LG X venture. Or if you don't care about the ruggedness or the DAC, check out the LG K10 (2017) instead.. Source (in Korean) | Via. LG X venture is now available for purchase in US. LG X Charge arriving to Xfinity Mobile with 4,500 mAh battery and octa-core CPU. LG X Power2 with 4,500mAh battery now available in Canada. LG X300 goes official: 5-inch 720p display, Snapdragon 425, Nougat. Is this one actually mil title worthy unlike the v30?. I doubt LG is ever gonna stop....

Starting off with the specs, the X4 Plus has a 5.3-inch display with a 720p resolution and a standard 16:9 aspect ratio. Powering the device is the Snapdragon 425 SoC, which has been coupled with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage.. The cameras for the X4 Plus are also pretty basic, as the device features a 5MP wide-angle selfie camera, and a standard 13MP rear-facing camera. The device also packs a 3,000mAh battery and somewhat surprisingly runs Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box and not Android Oreo .. As for the fun offered by the X4 Plus, the device is MIL-STD-810G certified, meaning that it is built to withstand the elements, including impact, temperature variation, humidity, and more. Additionally, LG has included a Hi-Fi DAC which will help you experience the best tunes when you’re out on a hike. On top of that, LG has included an FM radio in case you need to check up on the ball game or listen to an emergency broadcast.. Finally, the LG X4 Plus has LG Pay onboard, making it easy for you to quickly make payments on the go, without worrying about your wallet. Pricing for the device starts around $280, but there is no mention of whether this will make its way to other regions in the world.. LG's 2018 flagship to be revealed in June.
