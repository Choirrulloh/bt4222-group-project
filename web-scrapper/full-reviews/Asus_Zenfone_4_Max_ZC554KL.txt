Source: Hardware Zone If all you care about is battery life, the ZenFone 4 Max may be the phone for you (although even then, you should take a look at the Nokia 2), but if design, display, camera, performance, or features like NFC and 802.11ac Wi-Fi (which honestly should be standard on all phones by now) are at least somewhat important, look elsewhere. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 01/16/2018. 60% Asus ZenFone 4 Max: Big Battery Can't Mask the Blandness Source: Tom's Guide The cheapest ZenFone 4 is a perfectly serviceable smartphone with great battery life and dual cameras, all for $200. Unfortunately for Asus, other drawbacks make this phone difficult to recommend over the budget competition. Single Review, online available, Medium, Date: 10/11/2017 Rating: Total score : 60%. 80% Asus Zenfone 4 Max Review Source: Phone Arena We must say, Asusâ first of the Zenfone 4 lineup has us encouraged. Retailing for $200, competition is plentiful, but the Zenfone 4 Max makes a respectable case for itself. We love how fluid and snappy the device is, throwing in a gigantic battery didnât hurt either. Better yet, it doesnât feel like its packing 5000mAh in there judging by its weight, though it most certainly is. While the dual camera has its issues, it is certainly competent for the price point. The display's 720p resolution and washed out colors do make our hearts (and eyes) hurt when viewing anything other than full screen media or relatively large text, but all in all, weâre happy we met you, Zenfone Max 4, and we canât wait to meet your siblings.

Asus Zenfone 4 Max hands-on Source: Trusted Reviews The phone market is currently in serious need of a smartphone that can fill the gap left by the Lenovo P2. If the Zenfone 4 Max can deliver on even a fraction of the companyâs battery claims, it could be the phone that plugs it. Single Review, online available, Short, Date: 09/22/2017. ASUS Zenfone 4 MAX Review: Battery Life Over Everything Else? Source: Manila Shaker The Zenfone 4 Max has only one specific purpose, and that is to provide enough battery life to last you more than a day. It isnât spectacular, however, and other than the wide-angle double-lens camera, I personally think the Zenfone 4 would be a better choice despite the slightly higher price tag, if you really are looking for a basic phone.

With an SRP of Php9,995, the Zenfone 4 Max is designed for users who are looking for a device with features found in more expensive devices but can withstand heavy usage and doesnât break the bank. Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 08/18/2017. ASUS ZenFone 4 Max 5.5-inch Quick Review: Big Battery Budget King? Source: Unbox Surprisingly enough, ASUS has toned down the amount of bloatware in ZenUI, their custom interface thatâs layered on top of Android Nougat. Instead of more than 20 apps updating when we first setup the phone for our use, the app list has been whittled down to less than 10. Thereâs far less pre-installed crap on the device this time around, and while we still want a mostly pure Android experience on our phones, this particular compromise is more than okay.

On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. In the notebook sector, Asus had a global market share of about 11% from 2014-2016, making it the fourth largest laptop manufacturer. In the smartphone sector, Asus is not among the Top 5 and has only a small market share (as of 2016).. Asus Zenfone 4 Max Pro ZC554KL Adreno 505. Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie ZD553KL Adreno 505.

ASUS ZenFone 4 Max ZC554KL Reviews. With a whopping 5000mAh, dual camera with 120-degree viewing angle and instant switching chamber, you can take all the videos and pictures you want easily.. 5.5 inches, 1080 x 1920 p... 2G, 3G, 4G (LTE), 16GB, 32GB ... Please feel free to post your review on this product.. bagay na bagay sakin o sa mfa mahihilig magbabad sa online games.. so far wala naman akong naeecounter na problema.. yung finger print kahit slight touch lng gumagana na d gaya ng iba diniinan mo na d pa mabasa.. ok din sa design sa harap ang fingerprint mababa nga lang cpu speed pero tama lang para di malakas kumain ng baterya... I was hesitant in buying this phone because of other options. But up to this day this phone works really well for me. It is because of the battery. 5000 mah really do great and can last for more than a day. Plus its removable and I plan to buy a new set of battery next month. There are other phones there with battery as this big but I still choose ASUS, because it is a well respected brand. And specs here seems to be better. No lagging, no slow conncetion, just pure awesomeness. It works well to me so I definitely recommend it. If you need a phone with big battery this one is in the list!. Pang matagalan ang phone na ito sa totoo lang ito yung phone na nag tagal sa akin kasi mostly sa phone six months lang wala na pero ito maganda kasi naman maganda yung battery capacity niya 5000mAh na matagal tagal din mag lowbat talaga and aside from that maganda din ang camera ng asus zenfone talaga every update ng camera nila ay maganda ang result at may 120-degree viewing angle din ang isang ito kaya for me maganda talaga madami din gestures simple lang mag design ang asus pero maganda.. 5 for design napaka ganda at gusto ko talaga nasa harap ung finger print censor. 5 for portability may qualcomm quick charge 2.0 and USB type C and pwede rin sya isalpak sa PC. 5 for operability kung ASUS fan ka talaga alam mo na mga features ng asus at mga susunod pang features ng ASUS and i like this product. 5 for reponse because of Snapdragon 430 octa core processor ram management is optimized and speed is incredible plus the latest 7.1.1 nougat. 4 for display still in old design in front still in 16:9 ratio and its not on latest 18:9 but its ok small screen make phone faster. 5 for listenability napakalakas ng volume ng ASUS talaga lalo na mga zenfone series very good. 5 for battery is the cheapest well known product with 5,000mAh aside on Cherry mobile Flare s5 Max with 6,050mAh for 9,995 u have phone with 5k battery and snapdragon 430 is design to optimized cpu speed an make battery effecient. lang ang battery tinatagal pag gaming.. -ang hina ng sounds/ sa iba ata malakas.. -ok ang response mejo nag lalag sya minsan.. - however, nag lalag sya sometimes.. Overall 28/35 Stars For my opinion!. I give 3/5 for design because the back side of the phone is like cheap design also its copy like version of OnePlus 5 and Iphone 7 Plus but i like is that the back side is made of metal and its soft to touch.. I give 4/5 on portability because it has high ram with 3gb for 10k phone and 32gb storage but in real phone it has 22.75gb left in storage not bad and has qualcomm snapdragon 430 not bad for 10k phone doe.. I give 4/5 on operativity because u can use it on any weather i dont know if its water proof but its operatable phone. I give 4/5 on Response because first it has 3GB of RAM so less lag better gaming phone good for hard gamers but when i play mobile legends it response well but sometimes it lag i dont know if its network problem or something.. I give 5/5 on display because 1080x1920 resolution for 10k phone no one can get his high resolution for budget phone under 10k men even vivo v5 cant beat the display and its multi touch best phone for 10k. I give 4/5 on listenability because its pretty cool pretty loud phone not bad.. The main feature even samsung s8 and Oneplus 5 cant beat the battery of the budget phone of under 10k zenfone 4 max 5,000mAh so i give 5/5 this is very cool. Gusto ko sana makita ito sa personal kasi ang ganda napaka simple pero magaling yung specs niya isa sa bilib ako hindi siya gaanung mahal ang ganda ng specs kasi 5000mAh battery capacity that can last for two days and a very cool camera because it has dual camera with 120 degree viewing angle that can make your photo more realistic to look and it has a nice design that makes this phone more expensive to look and its has a very high resolution display on the screen thats why i cant wait to experience this very cool phone from asus.. ASUS Mobile Phones > ASUS ZenFone > ZenFone 4 Selfie ZD553KL. Ang phone na ito ay may pretty good design at quality. Walang issues ng heating problems sa mga games tulad ng Gangster Vegas, Asphalt Extreme, Asphalt 8 Airbourne, at iba ppa. ASUS Mobile Phones > ASUS ZenFone > ZenFone Pegasus 4A. Super cool and very nice ang design ng phone na ito. maganda ang performance at may surprisingly good screen. 1.25GHz nga lang pero para sa akin ay plenty at mabilis na sa mga light tasks nang hindi ...

Chances are the Verizon phones that worked were Samsung devices or Pixels which they code for multitude of carriers.. This is why if you notice manufacturers are starting to advertise if they support it on T-Mobile as a selling point.. Find ways to contact us now.

The Zenfone 4 Max makes a respectable case for itself. We love how fluid and snappy the device is, throwing in a gigantic battery didn’t hurt either. Better yet, it doesn’t feel like its packing 5000mAh in there judging by its weight, though it most certainly is. While the dual camera has its issues, it is certainly competent for the price point. The display's 720p resolution and washed out colors do make our hearts (and eyes) hurt when viewing anything other than full screen media or relatively large text, but all in all, we’re happy we met you, Zenfone Max 4, and we can’t wait to meet your siblings..

Asus ZenFone 4 Max Philippines Price, Specs, Initial Review, Dual Camera Feature Explained. Donning an official suggested retail price of Php 9,995 in the Philippines, the all-new Asus ZenFone 4 Max is the most affordable of the give new Android smartphones that Taiwanese electronics company Asus officially unveiled via their media and consumer event held last Saturday - August 19, 2017 - at the SMX Convention Center in Pasay City. Although the metal shell and overall footprint of Asus ZenFone 4 Max ZC554KL are largely the same as that of its predecessor - the Asus ZenFone 3 Max - which was released earlier this year, this new model does offer a number of enhancements in specs as well as fresh features that we're seeing for the first time in the Max series. The face of the handset gives you two new obvious enhancements coming from the older model. To specific, there's now a physical home button below the display, which features a Fingerprint Scanner for quickly unlocking the device all while making it more secure. Also, above the 5.5-inch HD IPS display , underneath the 2.5D Curved Glass touchscreen, you'll find the Soft LED Flash for the 8 MegaPixel f/2.2 front-facing camera , which comes in handy when snapping selfies in low to zero lighting conditions. Sidenote: Asus ZenFone 4 Max's aluminum unibody enclosure looks and feels almost exactly like the shell of the Asus ZenFone 3 Max, which is not a bad thing given that the earlier release was one of the better-looking handsets in its price category. On a separate note, the concentric Zen design element of this new smartphone is found on the real metal volume and power buttons. Another notable improvement implemented on the ZF4Max is its even bigger battery pack! Whereas the 5.5-inch ZF3Max was powered by an already big 4,100 mAh Li-Ion battery, the follow-up has an even higher capacity 5,000 mAh non-removable pack , which ensures longer uptime with regular use and gives more juice when the phone is used as a powerbank via reverse charging. Apart from the larger battery, my favorite new feature of the Asus ZenFone 4 Max ZC554KL is its Dual Rear Camera module, which is made up of two 13 MegaPixel optics with varying field of view. The first lens has a standard 80-degree field of view while the other is wide-angle at 120-degrees. Hence, with this Dual Cam set-up, you can capture a wider view of the subject in front of you with just a click of a button -- no need to take a few steps back. This comes in handy when taking photos of buildings or even groups of people. As I've mentioned above, Asus ZenFone 4 Max supports reverse charging, which gives it powerbank functionality. Simply use the USB-On-The-Go cable provided in the package to use this phone as a power source for your other mobile devices, including other Android smartphones. On the software side, the biggest enhancement that Asus fans will experience on this model is its new ZenUI 4.0 interface for Android 7.1.1 Nougat operating system. This version of the UI is simpler and has fewer bloatware, giving users a near-vanilla Android experience and eliminating unnecessary apps and processes running in the background. Overall, I think all these improvements make the Asus ZenFone 4 Max a great option for consumers who are looking for a fairly affordable mid-level 2017 Android smartphone -- even if some say that the internal hardware - which include the Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 chipset, 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of expandable storage - could have been better. If anything, however, I wish the company retained the Full HD resolution of the Asus ZenFone 3 on this refresh. But I understand that to keep the price of the device low all while incorporating new parts, they had to make such compromises. Not so sure, though, how fans of the brand will take this. For those who are interested, Dual SIM 4G-enabled Asus ZenFone 4 Max ZC554KL is now available at all Asus Concept Stores and partner dealers across the Philippines.
