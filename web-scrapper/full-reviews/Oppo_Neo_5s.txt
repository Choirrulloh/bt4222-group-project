Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI). Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Night mode, Effects.

The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Quad-core, 1200 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

Launching the OPPO Neo 5(2015) & Neo 5s: The Perfect Choice at an Affordable Price. Fans in a number of markets around the world will see a new edition to the OPPO family with the OPPO Neo 5(2015) and Neo 5s. Dedicating great attention to design and photography, the pair encompass visually pleasing aesthetics and plentiful features.. Sporting a double-layer metallic structure resulting in a compact, thin, and seamless body, whilst its tough inner core achieves enhanced heat dispersion properties. Undergoing 5 refining manufacturing processes, the uniquely laminated back cover gives the Neo 5(2015) a clean and natural, yet striking appearance with beautiful shine.. Its 8MP camera has a rear-illuminated sensor and a large F/2.2 aperture, making it more photosensitive with a higher resolution, blocking infrared light effectively to produce high quality images. Combined with features such as ‘Double Exposure’ and ‘Panorama’, the OPPO Neo 5(2015) ensures it has all your photography requirements covered. In addition, the onboard ‘Pure Image 2.0+’ system is packed with ‘Beautify’ and a range of other customizable features, meaning fun and versatility for all your photography needs.. At the heart of the Neo 5(2015) is a quad-core MTK processor, delivering resilient performance to cover gaming, video or multi-tasking needs. This is combined with a 2000 mAh Li-Polymer battery pumping life into the Neo 5(2015) and keeping you on the move.. Loaded with 8GB ROM and 1GB RAM, the Neo 5(2015) continues to deliver; supporting microSD up to 32GB to ensure storage never becomes a concern. As well as being dual SIM compatible, the OPPO Neo 5(2015) makes life all the more easier and convenient coupled with OPPO’s unique ColorOS operating system.. Developed to improve not only aesthetic qualities but also practical attributes, a simple three-finger swipe on screen will snap a screenshot at any time. Furthermore, ‘Smart Gestures’ will allow users to perform various commands even when the screen is off such as screen wake-up or direct access to the camera interface. So whether you’re searching for photography features, functionality or a striking appearance… the OPPO Neo 5(2015) has all the bases covered.. Above and Beyond, The Neo 5s. As well as encasing all of these great features, the Neo 5s goes that extra mile. Inside, the MTK brain has been replaced with a Qualcomm quad-core Snapdragon 64-bit processor as well as other extra features within.. For those with a big appetite, the OPPO Neo 5s supports a colossal 128GB of microSD storage, but the story doesn’t end there. An exclusive ColorOS eye protection system has been developed, filtering out the blue light, creating a soothing screen display that is easy on the eyes for enhanced health benefits.. If that wasn’t enough, smart multi-frame optimization and algorithms have come together to develop ‘Colorful Night Shot’ mode, effectively removing noise and improving both brightness and clarity.

Home News OPPO Neo 5s – Very first unboxing in Pakistan. OPPO Neo 5s – Very first unboxing in Pakistan. By Khurram Ali. OPPO Neo 5s is the entry-level smartphone from Chinese phone manufacturer which is now available in Pakistan and costs you only Rs. 131.9 mm x 65.5 mm x 8.0 mm. Qualcomm MSM8916 Snapdragon 410 Quad-core 1.2 GHz. 8GB(expandable up to 128GB microSD card). Support for Gloved and Wet Touch Input. Normal, Colorful night, Slow shutter, Expert mode, Beautify, HDR, Panorama, Audio photo, GIF, Double exposure. Distance sensor Light sensor, G-sensor, E-compass. OPPO Neo 5s, Micro USB cable, Charger, Earphones, Documentation. While OPPO is doing very hard globally, OPPO Pakistan is also trying best on its part and introducing the devices as soon as possible in the country. Not only, they are targeting the consumer directly but they are doing it probably the right way of involving tech and gadget reviewers on the web to trial their products and share or publish their in-depth opinion to their readers.. As mentioned above, the OPPO Neo 5s is the entry-level smartphone from the company but has a an edge over its hardware to support Android OS with a little push with 1 GB RAM for its ColorOS. 480p resolution also describes it as somewhat in between a low-end and mid-range smartphone for its price. We’ll check more in details in the review later.. Right now we are opening the box and want to let you know what’s inside the package and how the package is designed.. Well, as far as the product finishing is concerned, we already have our point of impression set for the Chinese manufacturer after having OPPO R5 reviewed lately. And here with the packaging of their smartphones, we are impressed to see that quality.. The package is wrapped into plastic cover and the outer box is made of thin card printed with the device labels and a set of key features on it while the inner box is pop-out style, hard and finished in extremely premium way – we liked it .. In the box, what we have else other than the device, are the stereo headset, a micro USB cable for data connectivity and charging, and a 1 ampere fast charger. Two user manuals are also included.
