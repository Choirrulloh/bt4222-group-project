Good Stuff Good performance while gaming or multitasking Excellent display even under bright light Awesome battery life Bad Stuff Low-light camera performance Hybrid SIM slot Takes lot of time to recharge battery. The Lenovo K6 Power is one of Lenovo’s recent smartphone launches that were showcased at IFA 2016 along with two other smartphones.. The K6 Power features a 5.0-inch display with 1080 x 1920 p resolution and 441 PPI of pixel density that enables the phone to show crisp, bright colors on its IPS display. The only but minor downside to the display is the matter of skewed viewing angles where quality takes a hit. Like the K6, the K6 power also comes in a unibody metal design in three colors: dark grey, gold, silver.. The phone runs Marshmallow 6.0 on a Snapdragon MSM8937 430 chipset that holds an octa-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53 processor and 3GB of RAM that will handle complex tasks with relative ease. Multitasking might be slow with these numbers, but will not be too much of a hindrance. The K6 Power is equipped with a 32GB of storage for default apps and data, which can be increased to 256G with an SD card. An Adreno 505 GPU handles graphics with ease without taking a large toll on the battery.. The primary camera is 13-megapixels with autofocus and LED flash that captures quality images. It can also record videos in 1080p at 30 fps. The front facing camera is 8-megapixels, only capable of capturing mediocre selfies. The battery on the K6 Power is a whopping 4,000mAh non-removable Li-Po one that will last over a day with moderate use.

Please ask the question in above box. What is meant by hybrid slot?. We can insert SIM card in one slot and in the second slot we can put either the SIM or a memory card.. You can use two SIMs, and if you want a microSD card, then you have to sacrifice one SIM slot.. You can use 2 SIMs or 1 SIM and 1 microSD card.. What is NFC CHIPSET and INFRARED?. NFC stands for “Near Field Communication” and, as the name implies, it enables short-range communication between compatible devices. This requires at least one transmitting device, and another to receive the signal. A range of devices can use the NFC standard and can be considered either passive or active, depending on how the device works.. IR data transfer uses a beam of infrared light to send data and operates only at a range of about a meter. Since most televisions and other home entertainment appliances use IR remote controls, some smartphones can be configured to control these devices using third-party applications.. NFC means Near Field Communication, which was often used by Nokia and Samsung before 5 years. Now it's available in all the company models. It's a communication Mode like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. It can be used for file sharing, RFID card and ATM card processes.. Infrared is not used as a communication medium. it is occasionally used on mobile as IR blaster (Universal Remote) or in flashlights of the mobile for the night view.. “Near Field Communication” it enables short range communication between compatible devices for transferring the data from one device to other. Infrared connectivity is an old wireless technology used to connect two electronic devices.. It enables short range communication between compatible devices for transfering the data from one device to other. Infrared connectivity is an old wireless technology used to connect two electronic devices.. There is no such drop in network connectivity. You will find no such issues in this phone regarding phone's network problem. Is this phone better than Samsung Galaxy on7 pro?. In my opinion, Yes, Lenovo K6 power is much better in all the aspects such as performance. If you are a heavy gamer, then this is the best phone at this price. As it has FHD display, it very clear and much better than On 7 pro. The battery is 4000 mAh which is more than enough to last for a whole day and camera does an excellent job as compared with other phones in this price segment. It has a full metal body and gives a premium feel on hand but it is little heavier and it has all sensors even VR mode.. Yes it has 3GB RAM and it also 32GB internal storage. You will get the latest Snapdragon 430 Octa-core processor which is the latest chipset. One of the most important aspect is the 4000 mAh battery which gives you at least one and a half days of backup.. As a MP4 player it is nice. Mic has design defect & Lenovo is not bothered. The receiver is unable to hear you. It gets heated while charging & multitasking. If you want to use it for voice calling, then don't buy.. I will not suggest you to purchase K6 Power because of it's heating issue. I purchased this phone on 10th May, still facing heating issue. Galaxy on7 Pro is better than Lenovo K6 Power.. You can go for comparison chart in my smart price. Then you can understand which one is good.. Is this phone is better than Xiaomi redmi 3 s prime?. Yes, Its better than Redmi 3S.. Some people have told that Redmi 3s has got better processor but reality is that Both the phones have Snapdragon 430 processor. So, there is no questions of substandard performance.. Now, hanging is a problem with all the budget processors and 430 is the processor being used in almost all the good budget Smartphones under 10,000.. If you will push any phone with Snapdragon 430 processor, it will hang. For reasonable performance like gaming and all, it will not disappoint. But if you are a gaming freak and play too much of high definition and demanding games then better go with a phone with processor Snapdragon 625, 650 or Mediatek Helio p10 and above process.. It can not be said that Lenovo K6 Power is better than Redmi 3 S Prime. But I can say that Sound Quality is definitely better than Redmi 3 S Prime. Other advantages of this phone over Redmi 3 S Prime are... You could check in Google to see more details of comparison of this phone with Redmi 3 S Prime.. The phones are more or less the same but where Lenovo K6 Power is better than Redmi 3S Prime is the HD display and better interface. So overall I would suggest you go with Lenovo.. the camera quality is better than red mi 3s prime, and also sound quality is better than redmi.. Yes, compared with camera and resolution. Not a very fast processor but is quite a good one for budget phone.. You will not come across any difficulty as it will be able to handle almost all the usual jobs you require your smartphone to do.. Asus Zenfone max had the earlier version of this processor running on Quad Core technology.. This is the upgraded version with Octa Core facility and with 4 GB RAM handling capacity.. In fact this processor is being used by many other even phones with 13-14 thousand price tags- Asus Zenfone Max 2, K6 Note, etc. So, it's a good processor with decent performance. K6 Power has very good specifications with proper balance of Power and Performance.. It comes with 1.4GHz octa-core with Qualcomm Snapdragon 430, which handles heavy games very smoothly. I am using this phone for over a month and I played all the heavy and high graphics games and this phone handles all of them very smoothly. I didn't find any lags till now and if you are a heavy gamer like me, then you are going to love this phone for its smooth performance and huge battery capacity.

And by far we can say that K6 Power has eliminated all competition. This is the Best one in Budget segment. With 3GB RAM and Octa Core processor it can run anything with ease. K6 Power and 3S Prime both have same RAM and Processor. The 32GB ROM gives you ample space to store and you will mostly don't require a Memory card, Still Expandable storage Upto 128GB is given if you can sacrifice Second SIM. Here, Redmi 3S Prime and K6 Power are tied and both have a drawback if you want to get both- Second SIM as well as SD Card. Again both have a 5 inch Display but here is the point where K6 Power Scores. K6 Power has Full HD Display i.e. While reading for a long time a phone with Full HD display will be more helpful. So, K6 Power has definitely an edge over Redmi. Both have 13MP Primary Camera but K6 Power has 8MP Front Camera whereas Redmi has just 5MP. So, here again K6 Power is a winner. In all cases Lenovo clicks better photographs than Redmi. You must be assured about that. Of course the quality will not match K4 Note, K5 Note or Zenfone or Moto but it is a decent snapper. With both of them having 4000 mAh Li-Polymer Battery K6 Power is behind Redmi by 100 mAh but that is a small difference. Power gives you 1.5 days back up even with heavy usage. For a normal user, it will give 2 days backup. Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 Processor is the machine behind both the devices, so again a tie, Operating System Android Marshmallow 6.0.1. Processor Clock Speed is 1.4 GHz for both. Memory Card Slot Type is Hybrid Slot for both. PDAF with FHD Video Recording is available in both. So, we see that Lenovo K6 power is a great device if you can go upto 10,000. Reviewed on MySmartPrice. Report spam 0 0.

It’s hard to talk about any phone in the sub-Rs 15,000 segment without mentioning Xiaomi. Xiaomi’s stellar Redmi Note 3 and 3S Prime are ruling the roost in that segment just as Samsung and Apple are king of the flagships.. Muscling its way into this exalted company is Lenovo’s K6 Power smartphone. On paper, the phone offers a surprisingly reasonable package ( Asus, take note ) and seems like a compelling alternative to Xiaomi’s budget kings. Here’s how it fared in our review.. Build and Design: 7 / 10. Note the powdered finish on the metal back. Given that the phone is selling for Rs 9,999, I did temper my expectations, but I’m still disappointed with the build quality. The back of the phone is metal and the matte grey finish (the colour we received for testing) isn’t bad.. The metal finish means that the phone does get a bit slippery, though.. As the two rear speaker grills suggest, you get dual-speakers. You get a centre-aligned camera and fingerprint sensor on the back and a dual-speaker grill near the bottom at the rear.. Strangely enough, the micro-USB port is placed at the top, alongside the 3.5mm headphone jack. You’ll find the power and volume buttons on the right and the SIM card slot on the left.. You get capacitive buttons on the front, but they're not backlit, which is frustrating. The buttons are capacitive, but are reflective and not backlit, which was disappointing.. The fit of the device is very good, even though the quality of the materials could have been better. While I personally feel that the Redmi Note 3 offers better build quality, the build and finish of the K6 power is actually not that bad. There are no sharp edges and the colour tone is uniform. I just wish it didn't feel so tacky.. In terms of specifications, you get a 5-inch, Full HD IPS LCD screen. This translates to a PPI of 441, which is very good. The chipset is a Snapdragon 430 unit clocked at 1.4GHz — the Redmi Note 3 offers a much more powerful Snapdragon 650 — that’s backed with either 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage or 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Memory is expandable by up to 256GB via a microSD card slot.. The rear camera is a 13MP unit with PDAF and the front camera is an 8MP unit. The rear camera can record video at 1080p and 30fps.. You get a nice pair of dual-speakers, but they’re oddly positioned on the rear of the unit. For what it’s worth (very little), these speakers get Dolby Atmos support.. Connectivity is comes in the form of Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2 and micro USB v2.0. An FM Radio antenna is also available.. The 5-inch IPS LCD panel with Full HD resolution offers good pixel density and little else. The maximum brightness is good enough for use in daylight, but that’s where the good news ends.. 441 ppi is nice, but colour rendition needs work. The contrast ratio is quite bad, the screen has a decidedly blue cast to it and colours are definitely muted. Textures also get muddy in colourful scenes.. Don’t expect to be wowed by this screen, but at Rs 9,999, it’s not so bad. The screen doesn't seem to have much of an oleophobic coating and is thus a great fingerprint magnet.. The phone runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with Lenovo’s Vibe Pure skin on top. The skin is light enough, though I would have preferred stock Android.. That said, there are a number of software tweaks that I really liked.. You get a number of useful gestures such as double-tap to wake the screen, double-tap the volume button to take a photo, reduce the volume of the ringtone when you pick up the phone, etc.. More useful than this is a feature that lets you run apps under two different accounts. You can have WhatsApp running with two different registrations, for example.. These are all nifty features, but some, like double-tap to wake, are a little slow to respond. That general slowness in fact, pervades the entire K6 Power experience.. Given that it’s powered by a Snapdragon 430, the K6 Power’s performance is rather underwhelming. While the UI is smooth, everything else, including the camera and especially the browser, seem ponderous in. Opening a new tab, waiting for a page to load, waiting for the keyboard to pop-up, etc., are all part and parcel of the experience.. If the Redmi Note 3 didn’t exist, I’d say that this performance was par for the course. Since it does exist, the K6 Power’s performance is disappointing.. You’ll be happy to note, however, that the device never once heated up in our tests. It got slightly warm under sustained load, but that’s as far as it got.. But then again, Lenovo placed them on the back and didn’t even take the trouble to give the rear a small lip or bump to raise the rear slightly. Because of this, audio can get muted if you place the device on its back on a flat surface.. In any other situation, however, the dual-speakers are quite loud and clear and I have absolutely no complaints on that front.. Another area where this phone does well is in call quality. Voice quality was good and I didn’t experience any unexpected network losses. Data signals (4G) were always decent on my usual route.. Oh, and the fingerprint sensor is fast and responsive.. If it wasn’t for the general sluggishness of the phone, I don’t think I would have had any complaints.. I’m actually a bit impressed with the camera. It’s quite decent at this price and the camera software boasts of many useful features. Peruse through the Flickr album below to examine the images and read my notes.. You get manual control over ISO and white balance, control over metering methods as well as a level indicator.. The feature I liked most about the camera is its speed. It’s quick to adapt to changing lighting conditions and focus distances and I don’t think I ever missed a shot because the camera couldn’t meter and focus in time.. Image quality itself is strictly average. In good light, the camera can hold its own with any budget contender in its class and even in low-light, performance isn’t terrible.. There is noise to be found for sure, and this is a budget camera, so don’t get your hopes up too high. However, for its price, this is a very decent camera indeed.. One very frustrating aspect of the camera is that the cover glass picks up fingerprint sensors very easily. The resultant images are blurry and not metered correctly and I had to clean the glass almost every time I had to take a photo.. My daily usage approximates to about 2-3 hours of video, the same amount of music, maybe a handful of photos, dozens of messages on WhatsApp and Telegram and easily 2-3 hours of reading on the web (over 4G). I don’t game much on my phone and I doubt I spend more than half an hour a day playing games. I also don’t spend more than a couple of minutes a day talking on the phone.. Given that usage, my iPhone 6S Plus runs out by the time I get to bed, which translates to a solid 15-18 hours of battery life. In comparison, the Lenovo K6 Power with its 4,000-mAh battery easily got me through a day and a half of usage. This is roughly what I managed on the Redmi Note 3 as well.. Charging was slow, with the battery taking an hour to go from 1 percent to 29 percent. A full charge can take almost 4 hours at times.. I did notice that the battery tends to drain very fast the moment I run some intensive app, like a game. This is expected, but that drain is a little faster than I’ve experienced on other Android devices.. These observations are borne out by the fact that our intensive PCMark Battery Life benchmark rated the K6 Power at just under 9 hours. This is a bit low, given the stellar battery life we’re seeing from smartphones these days.. However, it bears mention that the cheaper Redmi 3S Prime offers a slightly larger battery and much longer battery life (11.5 hours on a 4,100-mAh battery).. The Lenovo K6 Power’s price places it at rather awkwardly in the budget-smartphone lineup. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 is available at the same price and offers a Snapdragon 650, which is at least 30 percent faster than the K6 Power. The Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime is cheaper and offers the same performance and way better battery life, albeit with a lower-resolution screen.. Compared to the other offerings on the market, particularly those from Asus , the Lenovo K6 Power is a great deal. Compared to Xiaomi’s offerings, it’s not.. Considering all of this, I would urge anyone that’s looking for a budget phone to look no further than the Redmi Note 3. If you’re looking for a better deal, the Rs 6,999 Redmi 3S Prime (2GB RAM/16GB storage) is a great option.. Only if you’re dead set against a Xioami phone would I recommend the K6 Power, though.. If you fall in that latter group, rest assured that you’re getting a good deal in the K6 Power; just know that it's not the best deal. The Lenovo K6 Power features a 5.0-inch FHD IPS display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and is powered by a 1.4GHz octa core processor and has 3GB of RAM. It comes with 32GB of inbuilt storage, expandable upto 128GB and has a 13.0-megapixel rear camera and 8.0-megapixel front camera. It comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow OS and support a 4000mAh battery capacity with 3G & 4G.. 70.3 x 9.3 x 141.9 mm. Published Date: Dec 27,2016 12:51 pm. | Updated Date: Dec 27, 2016 12:51 pm.

Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Lenovo K6 Power has been priced at Rs. It is available exclusively on Flipkart. Gadgets 360 rated the phone 8 out of 10. Lenovo today holds the second place in terms of smartphone market share in India, according to IDC data for Q3 2016. The Chinese company has been one of the few companies that has been launching 4G-enabled smartphones in India for a long time.. In 2015, the company claimed it had a 30 percent share of the 4G smartphone market in the country. Lenovo's dominance however has been challenged by other vendors, even as the market grows thanks to Reliance Jio's 4G network and other telcos making big investments in 4G as well. Lenovo has been dealing with solid competition from other Chinese counterparts including Xiaomi, which has for the first time made it into the top five in India.. The recently unveiled Lenovo K6 Power tries to further strengthen the company's portfolio in the sub-Rs. The company already offered a slew of models in this segment including the Lenovo Vibe K5 ( Review ), Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus ( Review ), and the now-dated Lenovo Vibe K4 Note ( Review ). The new Lenovo K6 Power features an all-metal body and comes with a fingerprint scanner. One of its highlights is a large 4000mAh battery which also supports reverse charging, which means it can charge other devices connected to it.. There are other models in the same price bracket that offer similar features, such as the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime ( Review ), Coolpad Note 5 , and Asus ZenFone Max (2016) ( Review ). In our first impressions , the Lenovo K6 Power looked like a solid competitor in its price segment, but will it be able to live up to our expectations? Let's find out.. Lenovo K6 Power design and build At first glance, the metal-bodied Lenovo K6 Power looks strikingly similar to the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime. The two are more similar when seen from the front than from the back, as the rear has some differences in terms of the camera placement and antenna bands. The camera is placed in the middle alongside an LED flash and the fingerprint scanner, similar to the arrangement on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 .. Lenovo branding can be seen on the lower back, along with dual speaker grilles. The phone is available in Dark Grey (which we got for review), Gold, and Silver. The front of the K6 Power is dominated by a 5-inch screen, with capacitive navigation buttons below. We wish that the navigation buttons had been backlit, as we struggled to find them in the dark.. ( Also see : Lenovo K6 Power vs Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime vs Coolpad Note 5 vs Asus ZenFone Max 2016 ). At 9.3mm and 145 grams, the Lenovo K6 Power is definitely thicker but barely heavier than the Redmi 3S Prime, which measures 8.5mm thick and weighs 144 grams. The physical button placement on the K6 Power is ergonomic. The power and volume buttons are on the right, while the left has the SIM slot. The 3.5mm headphones socket and Micro-USB charging port are on the top. A notification LED is hidden in the earpiece grille.. sensitive and unlocks the phone quickly. Lenovo has included app lock functionality which can be set up to use the fingerprint sensor.. The all-metal body gives the K6 Power a premium feel, though it also makes the phone a bit slippery. It could slip out of a hands if not held carefully. However, it was easy to use with just one hand thanks to the manageable 5-inch screen. We liked some of the UI additions made by Lenovo including the shortcut of double-pressing on a volume button to launch the camera app quickly. This works even with the phone locked.. The 5-inch screen on the Lenovo K6 Power has a full-HD resolution, for a density of 441ppi which makes text appear quite sharp. Brightness is good and colours are punchy. Viewing angles and sunlight legibility are also decent. The display on the K6 Power is one of its biggest highlights. The Lenovo K6 Power's retail box includes a regular charger, a data cable, a SIM ejector tool, and instruction leaflets.. Lenovo K6 Power specifications and features The Lenovo K6 Power is powered by the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor that we've seen in the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime. This octa-core SoC is clocked at 1.4GHz and is coupled with 3GB of RAM. The phone has 32GB of inbuilt storage and supports expansion using a microSD card (up to 128GB). Dual Nano-SIMs are supported, but unfortunately, the K6 Power uses a hybrid SIM slot which means users have to chose either two SIMs or one SIM with a microSD card. Connectivity options include 4G with VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, FM radio, Micro-USB, and GPS/A-GPS.. The Lenovo K6 Power runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Lenovo's Vibe Pure UI on top. The company has been reducing the bloatware on its smartphones, and the UI on the K6 Power definitely felt smooth. There are two default home screens with app icons scattered across them. It's worth mentioning that there is no default Gallery app on the K6 Power, which might be slightly confusing for new users. Google Photos is preinstalled but not set as the default photo handler. Lenovo however provides access to all kinds of files through a File Manager app.. The dropdown shade offers quick settings along with notifications. The preloaded Themes Center app offers several customisation options for wallpapers, icons, lock screen settings, and more.. Two of our favourite software features on the Lenovo K6 Power are the app lock functionality, which allows users to lock any app with a fingerprint, and the Dual Apps mode that. allows apps to be used with two different accounts on the same phone. We tested the feature and it worked as described. The second instance of the app is marked with blue SIM tag.. The K6 Power's Settings app has a section called "Feature" which includes various quirky customisations from the company. Quick Snap lets users take an image by double pressing a volume button; Knock to Light wakes the phone with double-tap on the screen while it is off; Wide Touch offers one-touch shortcut access through a floating button; Fingerprint Snap lets the fingerprint sensor act as an alternative shutter button; and Quick Flashlight lets you toggle the flashlight by long-pressing the Home button. Lenovo has also incorporated a VR Mode with its switch hidden inside the "Feature" settings page.. We found several third-party apps preloaded on the K6 Power including Evernote, Flipkart, McAfee Security, Skype, Shareit, Truecaller, Syncit, and UC Browser.. Lenovo K6 Power performance The Lenovo K6 Power was able to handle most everyday jobs and we had no complaints with the octa-core processor. Even visually demanding games like Need for Speed: No Limits worked smoothly. Multitasking on the K6 Power was fine, and apps launched quickly. While using the device, we noticed that there was over 1GB of memory free at any time, and we experienced no lags in terms of system performance during the review period. There was no problem with overheating either.. The display on the Lenovo K6 Power is great for media consumption. It was a treat watching videos, and playing games on this device. The dual speakers at the back are loud enough to fill a small room with decent audio quality. The phone also supports Dolby Atmos to tweak audio settings. The quality of the bundled earphones however was awful.. The Lenovo K6 Power, despite being powered by the same Snapdragon 430 processor as the Redmi 3S Prime, returned much lower scores than its competitor in several benchmarks. It managed 27,372 on AnTuTu, 19,718 overall in Quadrant, 5,603 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme, and 15fps in GFXBench's T-Rex test. In contrast, the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime managed 40,250 in AnTuTu, 21,253 overall in Quadrant, 5,714 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme, and 24fps in GFXBench's T-Rex test.. The Lenovo K6 Power sports a 13-megapixel rear camera with a Sony IMX258 sensor, PDAF (phase detection autofocus), and an LED flash, plus an 8-megapixel front camera with a Sony IMX219 sensor and a wide-angle lens. The K6 Power's rear camera can lock focus quickly thanks to the PDAF. The camera took some decent close-up shots that exhibited good colour accuracy, though on zooming in we found noise towards the corners.. Tap to see full-sized Lenovo K6 Power camera samples. The biggest problem with the camera on the Lenovo K6 Power is that it requires a good amount of light around. Low-light shots tended to have a lot of noise, and unfortunately, even the otherwise helpful Smart Composition tool couldn't fix that. The K6 Power's rear camera was unable to capture objects in motion well, something we also experienced with the Lenovo Vibe K5. The K6 Power can record videos at full-HD resolution. and these came out looking good. The front camera took decent selfies in well-lit situations though a screen flash would have helped in the dark.. There is support for 4G with VoLTE, and call quality was impressive. The K6 Power was able to latch onto mobile networks in areas with poor connectivity quite well.. The non-removable 4000mAh battery on the K6 Power managed to last for 14 hours and 30 minutes in our video loop test, which is not bad for a battery of this size. The Redmi 3S Prime with a slightly larger 4100mAh battery managed 14 hours and 50 minutes under the same conditions, but it's worth noting that the K6 Power sports a full-HD screen while the Redmi 3S Prime has a lower-resolution i.e. With heavy usage, the Lenovo K6 Power easily managed to last over a day, which was impressive. There's also an Ultimate Powersaver mode which extends battery life by disabling all functions other than calls and SMS messaging. We also tried the reverse charge functionality using our own Micro-USB adapter, which doesn't come bundled in the box. The ability of the K6 Power to be used as a power bank could can come handy in emergency situations. We however wish that the device supported fast charging as it took nearly three hours to fully charge the handset.. 9,999, the Lenovo K6 Power is a smartphone with a lot of promising features, and we commend Lenovo for paying attention to the little details. The metal body feels premium, and the fingerprint scanner is a nice bonus. The light Vibe UI was smooth throughout the review process, while the Snapdragon 430 processor turned out to be enough for our everyday tasks. We however felt that the camera on the Lenovo K6 Power is not up to the competition's level and might be this device's Achilles heel. The battery life and display are no doubt the biggest notable features of the K6 Power.. 10,000 price segment has some of the most popular handsets, it will be interesting to see how the Lenovo K6 Power fares against its competition. Those looking for alternatives can consider the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime, if they like MIUI more than Vibe UI and need a better camera..

Mobiles / Lenovo Mobile Phones / Lenovo K6 Power 32GB Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 7,213 Launch Date in India: 06 December, 2016 Compare. The Chinese handset maker, Lenovo is quietly building up a reputation as one of the brand that can be relied on in budget segment. Its Vibe and K series handsets are one of the most value for money handsets that anyone can buy at the moment. Lenovo Vibe K5 Note has been a good device that impressed many. Now the brand is all set to launch the next generation in this lineup and one of the first handset to arrive would be the Lenovo K6 Power. Here is a brief overview of the device for those who are looking for a good budget segment handset.. Good Display with Theatermax technology : Lenovo has equipped this handset with a 5-inch display that comes with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. This means the resultant pixel density of 441 ppi makes for a pretty sharp viewing experience. Also, it comes with the Theatermax technology from Lenovo, which makes it VR ready.. Close to stock UI : Earlier, Lenovo used to skin Android on its handsets with Vibe UI, which was heavily skinned and bloated, which dampened the user experience a bit. However, starting now, Lenovo has switched to Pure UI, which as the name indicates is close to the stock Android user interface. This makes for a familiar and convenient experience for many smartphone users.. Big battery : One of the biggest requirements by any smartphone buyer is to have a device that can see them through a day's worth of usage. Lenovo K6 Power, as the name suggests, is a battery oriented handset. Lenovo has equipped the device with a massive 4000 mAh battery, which also comes with quick charging.. PDAF : Most budget smartphones are not well equipped when it comes to camera, as a result many images turn out to be blurry as the subject moved just as you clicked. Lenovo has taken care of this issue in the K6 Power as the handset comes equipped with Phase Detection Auto Focus. This allows the 13 Megapixels camera on the rear panel to lock focus and capture even the moving objects clearly.. Hybrid SIM card slot : This is probably the only and universal con with most budget smartphones coming out in the market these days. Owing to this, you can either use single SIM card and expand your storage or use dual SIM in the handset.. Lenovo K6 Power 32GB Price in India. 8,699 .00. 9,390 .00.

The Lenovo K6 Power is the latest to join the hyper competitive sub Rs. A market that is dominated by the likes of Xiaomi, Coolpad, Micromax and more. The Lenovo K6 Power is then aimed to take the competition head on. with specifications and a competitive price point, the phone seems to have what it takes to make a mark for itself. We’ve spent a couple of days with the handset and here’s what we think of the Lenovo K6 Power.. For better or worse, the Lenovo K6 Pro is a pretty generic looking device. The front in particular could easily pass off as any other entry-level Android device. The device measures 141.9 x 70.3 x 9.3mm and in hand, it feels good albeit pretty much the same as any other in the category.. Up front is a 5 inch Full HD panel,. with a deep black shell running all around the device. With the screen switched off, the display almost merges into the bezels alongside and exudes a black slab like appearance. The metallic bezel running around the front of the phone extrudes out and prevents the screen from lying flat on a surface. An 8MP camera module lies above the screen while below it is a row of capacitive keys that correspond to menu, home and back. Unfortunately these are not back lit.. Moving on, there’s a volume rocker and power button lying over on the right side of the phone. We found the ergonomics to be great and the buttons are placed exactly where your fingers lie. The tactile feedback too is very satisfactory. The left side sports the Hybrid SIM card slot. Finally, in a rather unconventional arrangement, both the microUSB port and the 3.5mm jack are placed at the top of the device.. Flip the phone over and you’ll observe that the metallic back panel curves over the edges to reach the raised rim. The camera module sits above the fingerprint scanner with an LED flash placed between the two of them. The rear panel is also host to very visible antenna bands. Overall, the design is bog standard and visually inoffensive. Its not the best looking device but it won’t be an eyesore either.. We like the software approach taken by Lenovo. There’s hardly any bloat on the device and minor tweaks aside, it sticks to the stock Android paradigm. The lockscreen leads to the homescreen where you can place app icons or widgets.. You can also easily drop into the app drawer from where you’ll be able to find all remaining applications. We like the fact that bloatware has been kept to a minimum and so have needless customisations. Really, the icons aside, Lenovo’s software interface could very well be stock Android.. Let’s talk about some of the more interesting customisations to the software. There’s a full range of gestures integrated into the device that let you quickly take photographs, switch on the flashlight, use the fingerprint reader as a shutter button and much more.. Our favorite feature however has to be the Dual Apps profile which lets you maintain two versions of the same app. Its a simple affair to enable Dual App support on most installed apps and you can use two separate WhatsApp accounts on the device should you please.. Between the Octa-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor and Adreno 505 GPU aided by 3GB of RAM, the Lenovo K6 Power does well enough in its category. It’s main competitor is the Xiaomi Redmi 3S that packs similar specifications. Face it, a phone like this is not meant to be a scorcher. It strikes a good balance between power, performance and also battery life. We found that the Lenovo K6 Power worked very smoothly while navigating the interface. There’s no lag or stutter here. Even while multitasking we failed to get the phone to slow down. High end games run fine but take a bit longer during start up. We also observed an occasional drop in the frame rate.. In the 3DMark Ice Storm benchmark, the phone scored 9554 points which placed it in the middle of the benchmark list.. In the Vellamo 3 browser benchmark, the phone scored 2541 points which is about the same as most of the competition. Of note, the Redmi Note 3 Pro shot ahead with 4875 points.. On Geekbench 3, the Lenovo K6 Power scored 1752 points placing it at the bottom of our test bench.. Finally in the AnTuTu benchmark, the phone scored 44008 points lying right in the middle of benchmark list. As always, we don’t recommend blindly following benchmarks since they are only indicative of performance and can’t give an idea of regular usability.. A 5 inch Full HD IPS panel can be seen on the Lenovo K6 Power. pixel density of about 440 PPI.. Absolutely tack sharp, you’ll struggle to spot jagged edges anywhere. Images, icons and text, all look absolutely crisp.. Color rendition is good but tends to err towards over saturation. While not accurate, we feel that most users prefer the high contrast, saturated color signature especially for media consumption. Brightness levels could have gone higher which would have further helped sunlight visibility which is good but not quite the best.. The 13MP rear camera with a Sony IMX258 sensor has a decent enough pedigree. Unfortunately, camera performance was pretty disappointing. The images turned out consistently washed out and low light shots were night unusable.. In what is a pretty typical scenario, we took a photograph down the street but the sky was completely blown out and the colors look very washed out.. The Lenovo K6 Power did well enough in close up shots and the flowers looked sufficiently vibrant. We had a lot of trouble capturing the image of the moving dog and the burst mode certainly helped in that regard. Overall, the camera is usable but don’t expect wonders from it. Connectivity options on the phoe include 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS and USB OTG. About 8GB of the 32GB storage onboard is used up by the operating system. The K6 Power is a dual SIM device with a hybrid SIM slot that you can use for expanding storage as well. In addition, you can bump up storage via a USB OTG dongle.. Finally coming to one of the best aspects of the handset. The Lenovo K6 Power with its 4,000 mAh battery consistently delivered well over a day of usage. With relatively heavy usage consisting of multiple email accounts, social channels, a lot of WhatsaApp & Telegram use and a couple of photos as well, the Lenovo K6 Power still had over 30% charge left. Battery life varies drastically depending on use but all said and done, you’ll find it very hard to deplete the battery in a single day.. The Lenovo K6 Power is a solid offering from Lenovo and it manages to strike a very good balance between performance and value for money. Our biggest gripe was the camera performance which proved to be quite underwhelming.. 9,999, the phone makes a good case for itself. It stands right next to the Xiaomi’s offerings while providing a very competitive and in some. available exclusively from Flipkart ..

Sample photo from Lenovo K6 Power. Sample photo from Lenovo K6 Power. Also some shots in bright sunlight look over-exposed. However the camera struggles to focus in low-light.

Lenovo is back with another K phone in India, and this time we are getting the K6 Power. Lenovo K4, K5 Plus, K5 Note were all launched in India this year, but the latest one sports a beefy 4000 mah battery.. Lenovo is now the second biggest smartphone vendor in India, a position that was previously held by Micromax for some years. The K series, which is online only, along with the Moto phones, has helped the company become the biggest online vendor in India, if you go by IDC’s numbers. But Lenovo isn’t just playing the online-only game in India; in offline stores there’s the push from its A series smartphones. For now, this tactic it looks like this it is paying off.. The K6 Power is priced Rs 9,999 and given the specifications, it will directly take on Xiaomi ’s popular Redmi 3S Prime. So does the K6 Power live up to the hype? Here’s what we thought of the phone.. Watch our video review of Lenovo K6 Power. Specs: 5-inch full HD IPS display | Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 octa-core 1.4 Ghz processor | 3GB RAM+32GB storage (expandable to 128GB) | 13MP rear camera + 8MP front camera | Android 6.0 with Pure UI | 4000 mAh battery | Lenovo K6 Power full specs. If you put the K6 Power ,. next to the Lenovo Vibe K5 Note ,. you can see the similarities in design, except that this comes in a smaller, more compact 5-inch form factor. Of course, comparisons with Redmi 3S Prime will continue, and from the front both phones look very similar, except for the different styling of the on-screen buttons.. Lenovo K6 Power in a metal unibody design, that has become the norm in this price range. The main camera is in the middle of the rear panel, followed by the flash, and the round fingerprint scanner. Lenovo has added dual speakers at the bottom of the phone just below the logo. It has antenna bands running on top and bottom, and is slightly curved from the back, making it easy to hold.. We got the dark grey colour version of this smartphone, and it looks as good as any other mid-range phone in the market. As a design, the K6 Power might not be revolutionary, but it is practical, and that works in its favour.. Given that the 4000 mAh battery is the USP of this phone, let’s start with this. I set-up the phone with under 50 per cent battery and this includes close to 20 apps, all of which were downloaded on 4G, and the battery levels didn’t budge. Most phones start to get warm when you are downloading a flurry of apps, but the K6 Power handled the task easily. If you’re looking for a phone that won’t die, Lenovo K6 Power is a solid bet. Even with heavy usage like gaming and watching a lot of videos, this phone lasts a day. If your usage is moderate, which is just basic browsing, etc, you can go without charging this one for two days. At this price-point, a long-lasting battery life is a crucial need for many users, and K6 Power easily nails the brief.. Lenovo K6 Power comes with a full HD display which is crisp and vibrant. Watching videos, using the phone in sunlight is not a problem. Add to this, the 5-inch form factor means this is a much more manageable device, especially for those who love smaller phones.. Lenovo K6 Power has a 13MP rear camera, which I’d say is a notch above competition. In bright daylight, pictures come out nice, and there’s no tendency for the colours to look unnatural. However, there are some issues in low-light performance, which I’ll discuss next.. there’s 3GB RAM and 32GB storage on board which is expandable. The phone comes with Snapdragon 430 and multitasking is not an issue especially if your main use case is browsing the Internet, watching videos. But heavy games like Asphalt 8 do tend to lag.. Lenovo’s Pure UI is pretty much like stock Android, and that’s a good thing. It’s clean, swift, and comes with settings you’d get on a pure Android phone, and at this price point this is a win in my opinion. Most phones from other companies come with customised UIs at this price range, and these have some issue or the other.. Finally, this is a 4G VOLTE phone.I set it up exclusively via the Jio SIM, and faced no troubles with downloads or connectivity, and even calls.. The camera struggles with focus especially in low-light and tends to slow down. And there’s a lot of noise in these pictures. But again this is a Rs 10,000 smartphone. My main issue would be that some pictures taken in bright sunlight looked over exposed. For the selfie freaks the front camera is nothing exceptional.. Lenovo has kept the speakers at the back, which means that if you place it flat on a table, the sound is muffled, even with Dolby Atmos mode on. I really could not need feel a difference to the sound quality with this mode.. While I didn’t face any app crashes, I felt the phone does have some issues with touch response. There’s a lag at times when you’re trying to open some apps. The lack of fast-charging is a big miss on this phone; I feel Lenovo could have really changed the game by introducing this a budget price point.. Lenovo K6 Power is another phone in the company’s great lineup of K phones. It scores simply because of the UI and battery; the overall performance is not too bad either. Of course, the phone will compete against the Redmi 3S Prime, which is similar in terms of specs, except for the lack of a full HD display.. But Lenovo’s smartphone lineup looks a bit confusing as well. There’s also the older Vibe K5 Plus which has a better processor, but less battery and storage that can also be an option. It is also priced less than the K6 Power. But overall, the K6 Power lives up to its claims of. being a solid phone for under Rs 10,000, and you can add it to your buy list..

By Ritu Sharma on March 21, 2017. Really good product at this point. No heating issue, finger print sensor which is really too fast, solid sound and video experience. Battery takes time to charge, but not that long time as mentioned by many Tech gurus. Sometime camera llacks sharpness in low light, but I can't complain at this price point, where some other good brands r not giving half of solid features at same price point.. Finger print sensor, Dolby sound, crisp video quality, budget phone, no heating issue. Was this review helpful? 3 0. By Kuldeep Kapoor on July 13, 2017 | Verified Owner. This device comes with some really good features at a very affordable price. Featuring an octa core processor with 3GB RAM makes it sufficient to run multiple programs with ease and fastly. It has an average camera, although high in megapixels but quality is average only. It has stunning battery capacity of 4000 mAh.

The Lenovo K6 Power offers much more than just hardware specifications in the competitive sub-Rs 10,000 segment.. Updated: December 13, 2016 12:20 PM IST. Lenovo K6 Power Display, UI, and features. Saying that the Indian smartphone market, especially the sub-Rs 10,000 segment, is crowded will be an understatement. If you have been closely following the smartphone launches for last couple of years, most of the smartphones in the budget segment follow one philosophy – offer relatively high-end specifications at affordable prices. From customers’ point of view, it’s actually not a bad thing to have so many choices, mostly good ones. But at the same time, it has almost become difficult for brands to offer something “new” each time they are offering a new smartphone, considering that price and specifications no longer have the same pull. Lenovo , which has been in fray for quite some time, is now looking to move beyond the specifications war and focus on experience, which perhaps could start off a new trend in a segment that currently appears to be mundane.. Earlier this month, Lenovo launched the K6 Power smartphone, which is priced at Rs 9,999. Just like with some other competing smartphones in this segment, the K6 Power comes with the tried and tested Snapdragon 430 processor and 3GB of RAM along with popular features like VoLTE support and a fingerprint scanner. The K6 Power, however, isn’t just about specifications. Aimed at multimedia hungry millennials, the smartphone comes with Dolby Atmos for superior audio, TheaterMax for widescreen virtual cinematic experience and a full HD display with pixel density of 441ppi, 450-nit brightness and 178-degree viewing angles. Living up to its ‘Power’ moniker, the smartphone has a large 4,000mAh battery as well.. The Lenovo K6 Power takes on the current budget champions, the Redmi 3s Prime and Redmi 3 Note from the house of Xiaomi. I have been using the Lenovo K6 Power for over a week as my primary smartphone. Let’s find out whether the K6 Power is actually a standout device that finally brings something “new” to the table, or just another high-specced smartphone in the crowded market. Even though the popular trend is to have a big screen smartphone, Lenovo believes smaller is better. Having spent quality time with the smartphone, I believe Lenovo has gotten it mostly right.. Since it is a 5-inch smartphone, it has that compact look and feel. Keeping up with the trend, the Lenovo smartphone has a metal body with gently curved corners, and thin antenna lines at the back. Following the design language of the Vibe K5 Note , the Lenovo K6 Power too has a symmetrical design with the camera lens, flash and fingerprint scanner followed by Lenovo branding at the bottom falling in one line.. The front is dominated by the display, front camera and LED notification light on top whereas the capacitive touch buttons for navigation are at the bottom. The volume and power buttons are located on the right while the left side houses the hybrid slot for the microSD and SIM cards. Oddly enough, the 3.5mm audio jack and micro-USB ports are located at the top while the base is plain. The smartphone easily fits in your palms with the volume and power buttons at the side, and fingerprint sensor at the back within easy reach. You can comfortably perform single-handed tasks on this phone.. But then there some low points as well. Besides a compact screen size, the Lenovo K6 Power doesn’t really look very different from a lot of Chinese smartphones featuring metal bodies. Also, at 144 grams, the smartphone feels pretty heavy and is actually fairly thick at 9.3mm.. As said earlier, the Lenovo K6 Power aims to woo users who like to extensively consume multimedia on the go. The 5-inch full HD display has a pixel density of 441ppi, 450-nit brightness, and 178-degree viewing angles. All of this in a smaller screen gives fairly a better experience while watching high resolution videos or even playing graphic intensive games. However, the experience is best when you are indoors. Under direct sunlight, you may struggle to see the content on device as the display gets a bit reflective and you may need to manually increase brightness. The auto-brightness doesn’t quickly adapt itself to the light conditions you are in. Fortunately, these are not issues grave enough to mar the overall experience.. Speaking of experience, one of the biggest strengths of the smartphone is the bouquet of features that let you further personalize the experience. The Lenovo K6 Power runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow-based Pure UI. The interface is plain cold stock Android with some added customizations. It’s fluid and easy to get familiar with.. While it retains Marshmallow’s core feature likes Google Now on Tap, it comes with a slew of custom features like knock to light, which lets you double tap while the screen is off to light up the screen. It has a Smart Scene mode, which lets you customize volume and other features such as GPS and Bluetooth according to the place you are in. For example, you can customize it to Office mode, selecting weekdays and a time period between 9am to 10pm, where it will keep all settings tuned to suit the office environment. This could include keeping your phone on silent, or turning off the GPS inside the office where you’re unlikely to need it.. Another major feature is ‘Dual app profile’, which lets you set up two accounts of specific apps, such as WhatsApp or WeChat, simultaneously. This feature has already made its way to a lot of phones from brands such as Xiaomi and Coolpad in this segment. All of these features can be accessed by going to Settings > Feature.. The fingerprint scanner on the Lenovo K6 Power can read up to five stored fingerprints. It is fairly easy to set up and can also be used as a shutter button for the camera. It isn’t as fast as I would have liked, as the display takes its own time to switch on after I’ve already activated it.. There’s an App Lock feature that lets you lock apps such as Gallery and WhatsApp via the fingerprint scanner. To start, you need to go to Settings > Security> scroll down to App Lock > set a pattern or pin. The apps that have been locked will appear with a lock icon on the front end.. Besides these personalization features, the Lenovo K6 Power comes with Dolby Atmos for an ‘enhanced’ audio experience. The stereo speakers are pretty loud while the sound quality over the bundled headphones is also quite good. I played a few bass-heavy tracks on the phone, which I think is satisfactory, though slightly flat. However, vocals-based songs were pretty well handled. Unlike a few others in this segment, the K6 Power has a decent speakerphone that is very usable on its own. Lenovo lets you further customize the experience with a dedicated app for Dolby wherein you can choose from different pre-loaded sound modes such as Movies, Music and Voice. If you aren’t a fan of Dolby’s audio tweaks, you can simply turn it off.. Even though virtual reality is in nascent stages, and perhaps there aren’t enough takers for VR headsets, Lenovo has continued to put its faith in TheaterMax technology, which delivers widescreen virtual cinematic experience on the smartphone. This technology has been on some of the previous Lenovo phones such as the Vibe K4 Note and Vibe K5 Note. To experience this feature, you need to have a VR headset. Just like the previous Lenovo phones, you can activate the TheaterMax mode by simply long pressing the power button, and choose VR mode. If you are into watching movies on your phone, you should definitely try this feature out.. Personally, I liked TheaterMax because it doesn’t make me nauseous, as is the case after watching 360-degree videos through VR gear. Another good thing is that you don’t need to separately download content as this is natively built onto the phone, and converts all existing content into the widescreen cinematic experience.. The Lenovo K6 Power runs Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor coupled with 3GB of RAM. We have seen this combination work very well on the Redmi 3s Prime. Unsurprisingly, the Lenovo K6 Power is a pretty good performer as well. During my usage, I didn’t come across any lag while multitasking, and never needed to kill a few apps to keep the phone functioning smoothly. At most, I had 10-15 apps running in the background. The Lenovo K6 Power can also deal with some graphic-intensive games like Marvel Clash of Champions and Real Racing 3. Basic games like Subway Surfers or Temple Run are pretty fluid on the phone. Extensive gaming sessions slightly heat up the device but never to an uncomfortable level.. One of the biggest highlights of the Lenovo K6 Power is the 4,000mAh battery. And it is pretty impressive as well. The battery can easily see you a day with single full charge despite medium to heavy usage. I started off the day around 9am with 100 percent power, and by midnight it was still going strong with 15 percent battery. My usage included extensive messaging through WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, video streaming, social networking, a bit of photography, phone calls, as well as having apps such as Facebook and Slack always running in the background. The phone delivered about 7 hours of usage time. For power users, they can easily get through the day with one single full charge whereas light and moderate users can get roughly one-and-a-half day’s of usage.. Even though the smartphone offers you a large 4,000mAh battery, you can still further optimize the battery life via different modes. There’s a Battery Saver mode, which reduces device’s performance and limits vibration, location services, and most background data. Email, messaging and other apps that rely on syncing go into sleep mode unless you open them. You can set battery percentage at 5 or 15 to automatically turn on this feature.. The ‘background app management feature’ lets you restrict apps from auto-starting on power-up and background auto-start. After the screen turns off, these apps will close if they are not active in the background. With Ultimate Power Saver, you can restrict the phone to just key functions such as calling and messaging.. The smartphone comes with 32GB of onboard storage and a microSD card slot for additional storage. The K6 Power comes with a hybrid SIM slot, letting you either go for dual SIMs or one SIM and microSD card. Connectivity options include 4G with VoLTE support, Wi-Fi 802.11n, USB OTG support, Bluetooth 4.1 and GPS.. The Lenovo K6 Power comes with a 13-megapixel Sony IMX258 sensor camera with LED flash, Pro-mode, PDAF support, slow motion and time lapse. The smartphone does take pretty decent photos outdoors when you have ample of light, say in morning or afternoons. Image processing is pretty fast when not using any specific mode. The camera did take some interesting macro shots as well. Though the colors and white balance are pretty underwhelming, but looking at the price point, it can be forgiven. The smartphone does come with a few customization features to help you take photos according to your preferences.. It has a Pro mode which lets you customize white balance, ISO and brightness among others. There’s also a mode called art nightscape, which is supposed to improve low-light photography. I did try out a few modes, which didn’t really radically change the quality, but pictures looked slightly better nonetheless. Speaking of low-light photography, the smartphone doesn’t really blow your mind in such conditions. It struggles to get the focus right, giving you very shoddy results with noise and underwhelming white and saturation balance. One of my favorite modes was the ‘Artistic HDR’, which has a ‘Still Life’ feature, allowing you to take photos with depth of field.. The 8-megapixel front camera is pretty satisfactory and gives you Instagram-worthy selfies. Like other smartphones in this category, it comes with a beautification mode. For low-light selfies, it has a fill light feature that brightens up the screen with white light when taking selfies, to provide some amount of illumination. The experience isn’t what I would call ‘awesome’ and could have been much better.. Overall, the camera quality on Lenovo K6 Power is pretty average, and you have to be quite meticulous and careful to get the photos right if lighting conditions aren’t ideal. But again, don’t forget that this is just a Rs 9,999 smartphone.. With the K6 Power, Lenovo has done a terrific job at delivering the right balance between hardware, software, and more importantly, experience. While ensuring it has high-end specifications, the smartphone stands out in the crowd with its solid performance and features such as Dolby and TheaterMax technology, and reliable battery life. It certainly isn’t the perfect phone and has its own low points, such as the mediocre camera, but looking at the price point, you can easily accept some of these flaws.. If you are looking for a value-for-money smartphone at a budget of Rs 10,000, the Lenovo K6 Power is definitely worth considering for its interesting feature set and strong battery. If you are just interested in top-end specifications, then you may also consider the Redmi 3s Prime, which is available at around the same price.. Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with Vibe UI.

Lenovo K6 power Review 1st December, 2016. The K6 Power has a 5-inch, 1920x1080 IPS LCD. Out of the box, the display comes with saturated colors that don't look very good.

The K6 Power has a 13-megapixel camera on the back with phase detection autofocus, and single LED flash. It can also do 1080p video at 30fps..

Grab a logcat right after the problem has occurred. (Please include at least a few pages of the log, not just the last few lines, unless you know what you're doing.). If it is a random reboot, grab /proc/last_kmsg. (Do not bother getting a logcat unless you can get it just before the reboot. A logcat after a reboot is useless). If the problem disappears after running "setenforce 0" from a root shell, grab /data/misc/audit/audit.log. Remember to provide as much info as possible. The more info you provide, the more likely that the bug will be solved. Please also do not report known issues. Any bug not reported in the bug report format below may be ignored.

However, if battery life is your main consideration, then the Redmi 3S Prime is the phone to get. In all the phones I used last year, there wasn't one that came close to the battery life of the Redmi 3S Prime. MIUI's aggressive memory management combined with a huge battery means you'll easily get two days of battery even if you're a heavy user.. 1 more answer(s) | Spam?. pro and cons of lenovo k6 power?.
