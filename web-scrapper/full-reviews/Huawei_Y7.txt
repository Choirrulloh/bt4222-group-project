Since the manufacturer recently stated that it would not produce any more budget smartphones in the future, it might also be the last. But perhaps this refers to even more affordable. smartphones, since the Huawei Y7 costs almost 200 Euros (~$238; starting from $210 in the US) after all. For that, you get a quite large battery, a metal case, and a 5.5-inch display with the Y7.. The smaller sibling, the Huawei Y6, was able to convince us in the test. Now we ask if the Y7 is a close relative that just turned out a little larger, or whether there are clear differences. We want to find out in the test. We also compare the Huawei Y7 with similarly large-sized and priced smartphones, such as the. As a slightly more expensive competitor, we have also added the.

The buyer must decide on the color: should it be the gray model with a black front, the one in the completely golden color, or perhaps the silver back with a white front as in our test unit. In any case, the non-removable back is made of metal and the edges are rounded. Huawei Y7 fits into the hands very well. The bezels are very small on the right and left sides,. and it has the classical wide edges. At 165 grams (~5.8 oz), the Huawei Y7 is quite light, particularly considering the relatively large battery which, by the way, cannot be removed.. Pressure on the front becomes easily visible in the liquid crystal, but pressure on the back does not affect the screen. While the device can be twisted minimally, it does not creak and seems very stable otherwise. The workmanship is very good, and the transitions between the front and back cannot be felt..

With 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of storage, the Huawei Y7 is on the same level as its smaller sibling and also as the standard of most other smartphones in this price range. The user has 10 GB available for data and apps, since the operating system is also installed. Unlike the Huawei Y6, the optional microSD card shares a slot with the second SIM card, so that you have to decide between dual-SIM and microSD. There is a regular micro-USB port at the bottom edge. A USB-C port is still rare in this price range, but the. Xperia L1 , for example, has one.. While Huawei has installed Android 7 on the Y7, unfortunately, it is not kept very up-to-date. The security patches are from April 2017, so they are already almost 6 months old at the time of our testing. user interface is installed on top,. it does not make any significant changes in the basic Android structure, so that the user should quickly find their way. There are several pre-installed apps, and Huawei includes a large tool set, from a flashlight and service apps up to a Health app. Unfortunately, there are also several Free2Play games and pre-installed advertising apps on the smartphone, which the users will have to uninstall if they do not like them.. The Huawei Y7 offers WLAN according to the 802.11 b/g/n standards. More is rarely offered in this price class. which is currently 60 Euros (~$71) more expensive, includes the faster 802.11-ac WLAN and can also access the less used 5-GHz band. If you compare the transfer rates in our standardized WLAN test, the Huawei Y7 is on the level of the price range. The times to load websites are also average, and the reception is fully present near the router. At a distance of 10 meters (~33 ft) and through three walls, the signal strength is still 3/4 and the websites load at the same speed as near the. 4 and with that a maximum of 150 MBit/s during download and 50 MBit/s during upload are supported. With six LTE bands, the Huawei Y7 also has average features when looking at the comparison devices. In Europe this should be sufficient, but in further away countries, it might be difficult to find an LTE network..

While we cannot be located indoors, it takes quite long outdoors to achieve an accuracy of 6 meters (~20 ft).. For our practice test, we pack the Huawei Y7 together with the Garmin Edge 500 professional navigation device into a backpack and take a bike ride with the mountain bike. The difference in the measured distance is only 40 meters (~131 ft), and the Y7 records our route really quite accurately. Even though we can clearly see that the Garmin Edge 500 has considerably more measuring points, for leisure time usage or even some more demanding tasks, you can use the Huawei Y7 for navigation.. GPS Garmin Edge 500 â overview. GPS Garmin Edge 500 â crossroads. GPS Garmin Edge 500 â bridge. Huawei has installed its own Telephone app, which is very similar to that of Android. There are various tabs for calls, contacts, and favorites. When you open the app, you first see the numbers last called and the keypad.. The call quality on our side is very good: our conversation partner sounds very clear through the ear piece and the voice can be quite loud if necessary. However, the microphone records our voice quite muffled, but at least it does not distort it and can record very loud as well as quiet voices precisely. Through the speaker phone, the voice of our conversation partner still sounds good, but not quite as full anymore. Here the microphone can easily begin to distort, especially if we talk too loud.. With 12 Megapixels in the back and 8 Megapixel in front, the Huawei Y7 takes a slightly different path than most of the comparison devices and also the smaller. Huawei Y6 : there are slightly less Megapixels in the back, but the front camera has a higher resolution.. The front camera takes very bright pictures, which can become its downfall on a cloudy day, when bright areas quickly become too bright. But of course, this is an advantage in dark surroundings, even if you really have to watch out to avoid blurring the pictures. Otherwise the pictures taken with the front camera are quite sharp, and the color reproduction also appears fairly natural.. The main camera in the back takes decent pictures, even though the auto focus has some problems with our stuffed bunny, focusing on a sharp background instead. While bright areas become easily too bright, the color representation turned out well. However, in dark surroundings the camera does not brighten enough, but the images remain sharp and have relatively little noise. Videos can be recorded at 1080p and 30 FPS. Here the exposure reacts to the surroundings very quickly and correctly, colors appear natural, and the image is quite sharp.. Overall, the main camera does a good job, but the front camera is too light sensitive for outdoor recordings. However, selfies also turn out good in darker surroundings.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. We can confirm the good evaluation of the back camera in our lab test, where we take pictures under controlled light conditions. Although the color areas do not appear completely clean and are rather pale, those are rather details, and the image is reproduced very sharp.. ColorChecker: The target color is displayed in the bottom half of each field.. Except for a charger, SIM tool and USB cable, there are no accessories in the box of the Huawei Y7. Huawei also does not currently offer any additional accessories in its shop.. Huawei offers 24 months of warranty on its devices.. Huawei has installed the SwiftKey app as the standard keyboard. It offers dozens of setting options and statistics, and you can also adjust it with themes. You can optionally display an Emoji key and also a separate number row, you can change the size of the on-screen keyboard in five steps, and much more. Swiping as well as voice input are supported. Google's GBoard is also installed, so it is a matter of taste which keyboard the user prefers. In addition, you can also install keyboard apps from the Google Play Store.. The menu keys are on-screen, and you can change their sequence and also optionally hide them. There is also an optional simple mode where only few apps are available. You can activate a single-handed mode as well as voice control for taking calls. Huawei has also integrated a glove mode, so that you can operate the. The physical keys are on the right side of the case. The standby key and the volume rocker can be easily felt and have a clear pressure point.. The 5.5-inch display of the Huawei Y7 has a resolution of 1280x720 pixels. With that, the device is at the level of the price range. Full HD displays can be found mostly only one price class higher. At an average of 456 cd/mÂ², the display brightness is good, and at 92% the brightness distribution is very even, so that even larger color areas are evenly illuminated.. 451 cd/m² 476 cd/m² 461 cd/m² 443 cd/m² 467 cd/m² 460 cd/m² 436 cd/m² 450 cd/m² 458 cd/m². 92 % Center on Battery: 467. cd/m²) ΔE Color 4.3 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 3.5 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.35.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM detected 2315 Hz 14. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. The display backlight flickers at 2315. Hz (Likely utilizing PWM) Flickering detected at a brightness setting of 14. There should be no flickering or PWM above this brightness setting.. Hz is quite high, so most users sensitive to PWM should not notice any flickering.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 8995 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. At 0.39 cd/m 2 , the black value of the display is average. The resulting contrast ratio is 1197:1, which is not a bad value. has shown that it can also be done much better. Colors do not appear particularly bright on the display, but are also not too pale. An optional blue filter lowers the amount of blue light of the display and is supposed to help you fall asleep. It can even be activated by the time of day. If it is turned off, you can also manually adjust the white balance, either using three preset steps or smoothly. Huawei uses pulse width modulation to darken the screen in low brightness settings, which means that the screen is simply turned on and off in very quick succession, so that the image appears darker to the human eye. In the Huawei Y7, this is done with a very high frequency, so that most people should not be able to notice this.. We are also testing the display of the Y7 in the lab with the CalMAN software and the spectral photometer using the Standard and Warm white balance settings. In the Warm mode, the color display is indeed closer to the reference color space, and in the Standard Mode, there is a strong blue tint. However, in the Warm mode, the representation of the color space is very limited in the range of blue colors.. Response Time Black to White 18.4 ms ... rise â and fall â combined ↗ 3.6 ms rise ↘ 14.8 ms fall The screen shows good response rates in our tests, but may be too slow for competitive gamers. In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.8 (minimum) to 240 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (26.4 ms). Response Time 50% Grey to 80% Grey 59.2 ms ... rise â and fall â combined ↗ 30 ms rise ↘ 29.2 ms fall The screen shows slow response rates in our tests and will be unsatisfactory for gamers. In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.9 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is worse than the average of all tested devices (42.2 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. During cloudy days, you can easily use the Huawei Y7 outdoors. However, in bright sunlight, the very reflective display becomes an obstacle. The brightness sensor works well and finds the right setting quickly and reliably.. When viewing from the side, you can even notice with the naked eye, that the brightness diminishes quite a lot from particular viewing angles, even though you can still recognize the contents. Our camera recordings confirm this impression.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

This in itself is remarkable, because usually Huawei uses SoCs from its own in-house HiSilicon production. The built-in SoC has eight computing cores with a clock speed of up to 1.4 GHz each. With this, the Y7 is well equipped in its price range and even manages to pass the more expensive. Depending on the benchmark, the performance difference to the smaller. and the other similarly priced devices is considerable. In everyday life, the navigation through the menu is very smooth and changing between apps is also very fast.. with a 450-MHz clock speed is used. According to the manufacturer, it is compatible with all the current graphics connections, which is important for the smartphone in order to be future-proof. The Huawei Y7 is also above the level of its class in terms of the graphics performance, reaching for example a 50% better performance compared to the.

The Huawei Y7 is able to quickly access the Toshiba Exceria Pro M501 microSD card which we use as a reference. Even though it does not begin to reach the maximum possible transfer rates, the Huawei Y7 is the smartphone with the highest read and write access speed in this price range.. When accessing the internal storage, it does not look as good, and the Huawei Y7 is very slow, particularly during sequential reads and writes. Subjectively, the load times of apps appear still acceptable to us..

Of course we also test the gaming capabilities of the Huawei Y7. With its strong graphics card compared to the rest of the price range, the Y7 has an advantage over the similarly priced other smartphones and can even display the graphically demanding " Asphalt 8 " racing game smoothly in full detail. " Dead Trigger 2 " also runs smoothly, and therefore, simpler games such as " Angry Birds " or " Super Mario Run " run without any stutters.. Since the control via touchscreen and position sensor also works flawlessly and the graphics card supports many APIs, there should be no obstacles to enjoying your games.. in comparison Samsung Galaxy J1 2016 (min). 425, Adreno 308 Sony Xperia XZ Premium.

Under maximum load, we measure at most 40.7 Â°C (~105. This is a noticeable warming, which normally is not uncomfortable. However, when you put your phone into your pants pocket in summer after having used it under load for a while, a lower temperature would be more comfortable, especially since the warming occurs in a large area in front. In idle mode, the bottom area in front warms also slightly, since apparently this is where the SoC is located.. With the Huawei Y7, we do not need to worry about the performance of the smartphone dropping after a prolonged load. We can observe the frame rates in each of the 30 runs of our benchmark with the GFXBench battery test. The frame rates remain constant even after the last time, so the performance capabilities remain the same.. 39.2 °C 39.2 °C 39.9 °C. 39.3 °C 38.3 °C 40.7 °C. 38.7 °C 38.1 °C 38.5 °C.

In terms of power consumption, the Huawei Y7 is quite efficient. In turned-off mode, it hardly uses any power at all and during standby it is very little, so that you can leave the device lying around for longer without the battery getting discharged. which has excellent power management, the comparison devices use considerably more power overall, while still being able to be better in some individual values. But the Huawei Y7 simply delivers quite low power consumption values in all performance scenarios. Together with the decent performance capabilities of the Huawei Y7, this is very gratifying..

The images of the main camera are quite sharp and show a good color reproduction. You can also record decent videos with it. In particular, the Huawei Y7 is the choice for all fans of powerful smartphones, who do not want to spend more than 200 Euros (~$238). Thanks to the powerful SoC, it outperforms the other similarly priced and even slightly more expensive devices in terms of computing power. Since the operation also works well, the case fits into the hand well, the battery lasts long, and the voice quality is convincing at least on the side of the user, you can be pleased with a successful overall package.. The Huawei Y7 convinces with mostly sharp and good color camera images, a solid metal case, a long battery life, and a good performance for its price range. It is worth a recommendation, even if there are some details that slightly mar the overall impression.. So what reason is there to hesitate? There is the microphone which does not offer a good performance, the front camera which takes pictures outdoors that are too bright, and you should also consider the outdated security patches of the software. Yet, the Huawei Y7 still offers a very good price-performance ratio for currently 200 Euros (~$238).. Huawei Y7 - 2017-09-15 09/15/2017 v6 Florian Wimmer. Huawei MediaPad M3 Lite 8 Tablet Review.

SIM Only SIM Samsung Galaxy S7 black Apple iPhone 7 32GB black Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge black Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus black Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus rose pink Apple iPhone 7 32GB rose gold Samsung Galaxy S8 black Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge gold Samsung Galaxy S8 grey. Mid tier goodness with a mega battery. Our 2017 Huawei Y7 review finds that there has been a giant leap forward in technology and features, since the Huawei Y6 was released back in 2015.. Created for mid-range consumers, the new Huawei Y7 has a modern look and a huge battery that just keeps on going.. The Huawei Y7 looks really sleek and modern with a metal body that has a sandblasted surface. The overall look is generally uncluttered with rounded edges and an embossed camera edge, which adds a little character.. Fill in the form and be the first to know when the Huawei Y7 is released .. The metal body comes in three colour choices; Prestige Gold, Silver or Grey. On the front, the surface is covered with 2.5D glass, which curves at the edges to give a floating like appearance.. The total weight is 165g and the thickness is 8.35mm, making the phone not the heaviest or lightest, nor the thickest or thinnest.. The Huawei Y7 has a large 5.5” HD display (720 x 1280 pixels), making gaming and movie streaming a real joy.. New: Huawei Y7 Prime review. The 1.4GHz octa-core processor with 2GB RAM is pretty typical for a mid tier phone.. You can transfer content onto the Huawei Y7 from an old smartphone or Apple iPhone .. New: LG Q6 review. The internal memory is 16GB and this is expandable through the microSD memory card slot, which accepts cards with a value of up to 128GB.. The real beauty of the Huawei Y7 comes through its EMUI 5.1 user interface. This gives the Android 7.0 Nougat operating system a fresh look with colours inspired from the Aegean.. New: Samsung Galaxy S8 Active review. EMUI 5.1 puts 90% of the core operations no more than three steps away and brings useful features such as an Eye Comfort Mode and App twins. App twins allows you to have two instances of Facebook and WhatsApp running at the same time.. The Smart Calendar lets you view all of your schedules in place, with collected resources from your emails, Notes and SMS. A PrivateSpace locks away personal files while Global Search allows you to quickly find apps, songs, videos, reminders, emails and online articles, all from the search bar.. The Huawei Y7 has a powerful 12MP camera with a 1.25μm pixel sensor. The larger surface of this allows more light to hit it, which improves the results possible in low light.. A bit of premium phone technology finds its way onto the Huawei Y7 as well. Phase Detect Auto Focus (PDAF) is accurate and fast, putting the image in focus in just 0.3 seconds.. EMUI 5.1 also influences the way that you can show off your photos and videos. The Highlights app generates videos through scanning your gallery and selecting your best moments. It even adds music and sound effects for you, although you can edit these and add other elements, such as captions.. The Huawei Y7 has a 8MP selfie camera and as you might expect, there is a beauty mode and face recognition. You can easily remove skin blemishes and improve facial brightness with these tools.. Phones with the longest lasting batteries. The Huawei Y7 has a massive 4,000mAh high-density battery. This is way more than you will find on 95% of phones on the market and a real reason to choose the Huawei Y7 as your next smartphone.. The life of the battery has also benefited from the latest technological enhancements. Even after 500 recharge cycles, the battery will still be able to retain more than 80% of its original capacity.. Huawei’s power saving technology works hard in the background giving you up to 15 hours of internet browsing or up to 20 hours of video playback.. Next: Vodafone Smart E8 review.

Fergus Halliday (PC World) on 03 October, 2017 09:04. As with any budget phone, the Huawei’s 2017 refresh of the Y7 is best looked at in context. After all, the lower the asking-price, the more valuable even the basic box-ticking features become. More specifically, it’s best compared to the slightly-cheaper Y5 .. With a better display, bigger battery and crisper camera, the Y7 promises to give a little extra bang for your buck to those who like what Huawei is selling with the Y5 but want to cut down on the compromises.. The gist here is that for a price-point only $100 greater than that attached to the Y5, you get a suite of pretty marked improvements across the board. If the sell for the Y5 was a box-ticking smartphone experience for a sub-$200 pricepoint, the sell for the Y7 is one that begins to erode and blur the often-stark divide between budget and mid-tier devices.. It literally turns the Y5’s weaknesses into strengths, smoothing out its cut corners and leaving customers with a product that more than just ticks all the boxes and doesn’t break the bank.. The Y7 boasts an IPS LCD display (720 x 1280 pixels) and runs on a Qualcomm MSM8940 Snapdragon 435 chipset paired with 2GBs of RAM. Like the Y5, it boasts 16GB of on-board storage but is able to be expanded via MicroSD.. Again like its cheaper sibling, the Y7 features a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top-most edge but otherwise boasts the same metal and glass aesthetics you’ll find in most of Huawei’s range. It runs on Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) coated in Huawei’s own EMUI 5.1.. However, unlike the Y5, the Y7 has a more-sizable 4000mAh non-removable lithium-ion battery, charged via MicroUSB and supporting Dual-SIM configurations. It lacks in QuickCharge but boasts a Huawei-developed power-saving solution intended to bridge that gap.. Finally, when it comes to the cameras, the Y7 features a 12-megapixel shooter (f/2.2) with phase detection autofocus and LED-flash on the back matched by a 8-megapixel camera (f/2.0) on the front.. Is virtualisation the next frontier for network attached storage. Error: Please check your email address.. Rocket to Success - Your 10 Tips for Smarter ERP System Selection.

The printer was convenient, produced clear and vibrant images and was very easy to use.

It’s easy to set up, it’s compact and quiet when printing and to top if off, the print quality is excellent. This is hands down the best printer I’ve used for printing labels.. Brainstorming, innovation, problem solving, and negotiation have all become much more productive and valuable if people can easily collaborate in real time with minimal friction..

4.1 from 10 reviews. Your trust is our top concern. Companies can't alter or remove reviews from ProductReview.com.au.. 3 out of 5 ,. Brought this phone for my grandma, who doesn't need speed or performance. However battery life of this phone is really exceptional. The 4000mAh battery absolutely lives up to its potential. Most days, I notice that through a intensive use of the phone it merely even hits the halfway mark on the battery bar. On the software side, it's quite simple, no fancy features and you can even notice this from its design. But if you are after a decent budget phone, I would recommend it.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. My Samsung died so now I'm off plans and got this unlocked. The camera front and back is great quality. The size is great for my hand. It feels fast to use when I have lots of apps open. It doesnt have a double tap to wake the screen feature which is the only reason I've rated it lower... But that's cause I'm used to that feature I guess. Has all I need for under $200 and has some of the best ratings I found on Google. I'm not tech savy so can't say much more than I like using it and have found no problems with it.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. Very happy with the phone, able to work through phone and settings. Only trouble was length of time phone would ring for, but was able to rectify it, takes reasonable photos. Occasionally Bluetooth switches off, but that could be something I'm doing wrong. Able to fit in sd card which is great. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. Does all the basic and more. Dual sim card too meaning you can buy a travel sim and put it into the same phone! No need to carry 2 phones around or remove sim first. Big screen, runs android, really good camera. Purchased under $250, would recommend if you are looking for a cheap good phone!. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. Swapped from iPhone to an android and have been pleasantly surprised. Solid and quick, but occasionally freezes. Overall a good phone that does everything I need it to do. Not a status phone if that's what you are looking for. Lacks some of the features that the higher end phones offer i.e. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. Bought my 2 teenagers these phones for christmas ready for school, and for the price they are great value...i will definately be looking to buy one for myself once my samsung dies...same size screen and looks exactly the same...i had to order there case of ebay which is great that you can purchase these.... Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. Bought this online and been going good since. Things I liked about this phone are, battery life and touch. I think phone lacks features its competitors provide such as multithreaded performance, bright display etc. But nonetheless, this is a good phone if you are a moderate user and don't do heavy gaming on it.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 1 person found this helpful, do you?. 4 out of 5 ,. Just purchased a few days ago, so far so good. works well and was reasonably priced too so basically its a good bargain. If you're looking for anything decent with a good price then this phone will work with your budget. The camera is not as exquisite as the samsung phones but its better than nothing i must admit. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. The phone is excellent easy to used. Always have battery life even i used it whol day still full charge and i ll the grapics and the screen i like the color too. My baby love to wached videos and my boy playing games with it. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. Great price and easy to use.great camera the battery last a long time and dont have to charge it every night, once a week i charge the phone and i use it all the time. It has a step counter on it and heart app which you can watch your health. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 1 person found this helpful, do you?. Good to read that the text size can be enlarged. Can the keyboard size be enlarged? Thanks. How do you extend the ring time?. I guess this question isn't related to Huawei phone functionality but in general for android and iOS devices. I tried to answer it below,. To extend your ring time, you’ll need to make a note of and then dial a code involving your forwarding number. It will display the number the calls are forwarded to and the current ring time. Dial **61*+1xxxxxxxxxx*11*30# (where xxxxxxxxxx is the number displayed previously and 30 is the new ring time – you can pick 15, 20, 25 or 30). Dial *#61# to check the new settings.. Does the y7 have settings to enlarge size of text as i am vision impaired?. Hi Mooka, you can enlarge text size to huge. Like our Facebook page to stay in the know on amazing new products..

Mobile Phones Home Theatre Home Appliances Wearable Tech Networking Coffee machines. Review: Huawei Y7 Smart Phone Thomas Bartlett 6 months ago Google Android , Mobile Phones Features Performance Conclusion. Huawei released two budget phones recently. We reviewed the $199 Huawei Y5 2017 here , and now we’re diving into the $299 Huawei Y7. Apparently this is the first Y7, so it doesn’t need the year tag in the model name.. So, fifty per cent higher price, eh? Does it give you fifty per cent more?. To take one mathematically satisfying example, the rear camera has a 12 megapixel sensor. The one on the Y5 has an 8 megapixel sensor. Fifty per cent more! The front camera is 8MP vs 5MP, so that’s sixty per cent more!. More realistically, what you get is a phone that looks a lot more like a mid-level, even premium-level, model than the Y5. It has a metal back and 2.5D glass on the front. That means it curves smoothly at the edges for mounting into the bezel without a lip around it. There is no mention of the type of glass used. It comes with a screen protector already attached. I left it in place during this review.. The screen is a 5.5 inch HD unit, which is to say the resolution is 720 by 1280 pixels.. There is a rear camera bump, but it’s only a half a millimetre or so. There are two speakers on the bottom end, either side of the of the Micro-B USB socket. It’s available in Grey, Prestige Gold, and Silver.. There’s a 3.5mm headphone socket on the top and volume and power keys on the right. Unlike the Y5, there’s no assignable “Easy Key”. There is a proper tray for the SIMs and memory card. The soft return key is to the left at the bottom of the screen, apps to the right. Likewise, the home button is on screen, rather than physical, and there’s no fingerprint scanner. It’s this omission that more than anything sets this camera into the budget category.. The phone sports only 16GB of storage, of which less than 10GB is left over for the user after OS requirements. Fortunately, the phone can support a microSD card of up to 128GB.. It also supports two SIMs, but you’ll have to leave out the second one if you want to use the memory card. But since only 3G is supported on the second SIM, you may not be bursting to use it. (Nice, though, to have the option.). The phone runs an MSM8940 octa-core processor with four 1.4GHz and four 1.1GHz cores. It is loaded with Android Nougat 7.0 and runs Huawei’s EMUI5.1 interface (both of those are a version up from what’s in the Y5).. The standard LTE bands are supported when you’re out and about. Locally the WiFi is single band, with up to the 802.11n standard, while Bluetooth is version 4.1.. The battery is a biggie: 4000mAh.. I expected a bunch of general commonalities between the Y7 and the Y5 2017, which I reviewed recently. Same launch date, surely the same, but better given the Y5 is $199 and the Y7 is $299.. And of course, the Y7 is indeed better in most ways. But also different in the ways that you might expect a different brand of phone to be different. The Y5 offered “Set up new device”. Like the Y5, the Y7 doesn’t have NFC so there could be no tapping. But neither did it offer that option, so instead of transferring Google credentials over automatically, I had to type them in. A small thing, but quite different.. That done, it then offered to install my apps as identified by Google, something the Y5 didn’t do. It instead just up and installed a small, seemingly random selection of them. The Y7 gave me option to choose which ones, which I did (a bunch of them are Samsung apps which have no place on a Huawei phone).. I assumed for most of the review period that it was full HD. It was only when I came to do the formal review and looked it up that I found it was 720 by 1280. Even then I took a screen shot and checked out its resolution to confirm. I don’t think many will find the resolution to be insufficient.. The auto brightness setting was much more practical than that of the Y5, and when I was taking photos outdoors, framing shots was easy because of the clarity of the screen.. The implementation of Android 7.0 was fairly standard, apart from apps not defaulting to a separate apps tray. As you install them, they are put on standard pages.. You can edit the short cuts bar and the shortcuts page revealed by the second swipe. Hotspot and screen mirroring shortcuts are available there. Notifications work in the usual way.. As we’ll see, the processor isn’t going to win speed and power awards, but in regular use you wouldn’t know that. Much more realistic colour of the grass than the Y5. Initially I thought that the phone didn’t support OTG – On the Go – USB connections. My memory stick didn’t work and neither did the wireless Logitech keyboard/mouse I normally use for this purpose. Then for no good reason I tried a different keyboard and it started working. I switched back to the first keyboard and now it worked perfectly. I plugged in a USB DAC and played music. I plugged in the original memory stick, and now it worked. Perhaps the phone needed to download some driver or otherwise install it.. The phone also did a fine job screen mirroring to a Microsoft Wireless Display Adaptor plugged into a TV, and to a smart LG TV. The phone also worked well as a WiFi hot spot.. The battery lasted quite a long time. While I wasn’t using it much as a phone, it ran for three days before getting to fifty per cent remaining. I do like a big battery.. The camera doesn’t have a RAW mode, but does have a “Pro” mode which allows you to adjust settings. Amongst the settings are choices on where to save your photos. You can set it to the microSD card, which is useful given the small native storage. Bursts are always saved to the phone (I guess they can’t trust that you’ll put in a fast enough memory card.. The Y7 to the left, the right colour to the right. There’s also a setting to use a double tap on the volume down key to fast start the camera.. The picture quality was surprisingly respectable. Initially I thought the pictures looked a bit soft compared to the Samsung Galaxy S7, but I came to realise that it was mostly a difference in the amount sharpness post processing applied to the images. You can always do that later in software if you want.. In darker circumstances, it wasn’t as good at focusing, and while it has a HDR mode, that’s manual and so less convenient. It tended to leave those kinds of shots darker overall. The only really disappointing photo was the colour of the red flowers of a quince plant in bloom. They ended up a deep pink rather than their actual deep red.. Incidentally, the camera reports that it has a maximum aperture of f/2.2.. The phone does Panoramas in the usual way. It covers 180 degrees, left to right only, and the stitching was fairly respectable, with only some wonkiness on phone lines against the sky.. The processor is no speed demon. According to the Basemark OS II benchmark test, the phone scores 849, a little faster than the 795 of the Y5 2017. By way of comparison, the Huawei P10 scores 2679, and the U11 manages 3212. With the Basemark OS X gaming benchmark the Y7 did a fair bit better at 16833, more than doubling the Y5’s 8113. The two Huawei big guns scored a bit above 44,000.. So, is the Huawei Y7 fifty per cent better than the Huawei Y5 2017? No, of course not. If I had to put a figure on it, I’d say it’s two hundred and fifty per cent better.. If you can live without the fingerprint unlock, at $299 it’s a bargain.. Tags Android Huawei Y7. Previous article Review: Huawei Y5 2017 Smart Phone. Next article Review: Oppo R11 Smart Phone.

Phil discusses Day Two of Computex Taipei. Phil wraps up the first day of Computex 2017. My first review for Ausdroid was a Huawei phone, all the way back in 2012. From those days, Huawei has very much exploded in terms of popularity and reach.. The Huawei Y7 is their 2017 mid-range device and priced at $299, it’s got some stiff competition with the Moto G5 Plus and Oppo A57 and more.. Huawei has built a solid reputation building great handsets packed with features for a low-cost, but rumours say that may change so is this a good mid-range handset to get from Huawei? Let’s find out.. The contents of the box isn’t actually very exciting for the Y7. You get your phone, a microUSB cable and charging brick as well as a pin to open the SIM tray….that’s literally it.. The disappointment for me was that there was no inclusion of a basic TPU case which has been a very welcome inclusion in other Huawei reviews we’ve done. There’s also strangely no earphones, though this could be a difference between the review device and the retail device. I’ve got a few thousand earphones, so no biggie.. The Huawei Y7 is a pretty decent phone to look at, it starts with a 5.5” HD (1280×720) resolution IPS LCD display on the front. That spec though is fairly underwhelming when you look at the FullHD resolution displays on the competition though, that said it’s good enough when using it indoors and out with the IPS LCD giving good viewing angles.. The Huawei Y7 takes a step in the right direction from my perspective by packing in a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 (MSM8940) processor as opposed to a Mediatek processor which they use in lower end Huawei handsets like the Y5. There’s nothing inherently wrong with Mediatek processors – but Qualcomm does seem to handle better. That said, it is a 400 series processor – again, nothing wrong with it, but we are seeing Snapdragon 625 processors in the competition.. The pairing of an SD435 SoC with 2GB of RAM and 16GB storage (8.13GB user available) with microSD Card slot is pretty standard at this end of the market, though the competition is starting to up the ante here as well with both the G5 Plus and A57 packing in 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.. Camera wise, the Huawei Y7 is also right up against it when you compare the specs. A 12MP sensor on the rear behind an f/2.2 aperture doesn’t sound super impressive, however it that sensor is 1/2.9″ with pixels measuring 1.25 µm so low-light photography in theory should be up to snuff. An 8MP sensor on the front with an f/2.0 rounds out the camera specs.. Internally you get all the connectivity options including Wi-Fi (unfortunately 2.4GHz only), Bluetooth 4.1 and GPS (including GLONASS). There’s no NFC in here unfortunately so if you want to use Android Pay or one of the banks custom Tap & Pay options you’re out of luck.. You do get an FM radio built-in, which Scott continuously tells me is a massive plus for a phone, I’m not as big a user of FM, but it’s there and it works.. Cellular connections are pretty much all here with FD-LTE Bands 1, 3, 5, 8, 28 and TD-LTE Band 40 for Optus’ 4G Plus network included. The embedded modem in the phone won’t blow you away, but it definitely gets the job done.. As well as wireless connections, you do get a 3.5mm jack. You’ll need to have headphones connected to make use of the aforementioned FM radio but for audiophiles the connection is there….even if the actual sound isn’t spectacular. In terms of speakers you get twin speaker grills at the bottom of the phone, but only one speaker (behind the right grill).. Surprisingly in this day and age of USB-C, Huawei are still using a microUSB connector on the Y7. A microUSB connector isn’t a huge deal at this end of the market, in fact with most people having multiple microUSB chargers by now, it’s actually helpful, just something to note.. The standout feature for the Huawei Y7 is the 4,000mAh battery which towers above the competition. A fairly handy power saving mode in software means the phone will, in theory, eke out a little more from each charge cycle.. Huawei have been doing aluminium unibody designs for so long that they nail this easily. The 2.5D glass on the front of the screen curves gently around merging into the aluminium body with barely a seam, something not really found on most handsets in this range.. The 5.5” screen is in theory quite large, but the whole phone feels quite comfortable in the hand, letting you operate it one handed quite easily. Pairing this with some one-handed software tweaks means it’s quite a manageable phone even for people with smaller hands.. For once this year, I don’t have to talk about a phone being a fingerprint magnet. The Huawei Y7 has a metal, sandblasted surface on the rear which makes it very easy to grip, though a little cold in the Canberra winters.. The design does leave a little bit of bezel above and below the screen which is a little ‘last years design’ but I’m not overly concerned by this.. The inclusion of a screen protector is a positive takeaway, even if it’s not one of the ‘better’ tempered glass ones, the inclusion, pre-affixed means most people will have a much better experience overall. It’s quite obvious that there is a screen protector installed, the cut out is quite obvious, but it’s stuck on well enough.. I’m also pretty happy with the battery life on the Y7. It’s not using a high-end processor, the screen resolution is fairly low and this means there’s little actually drawing power. The battery lasted me happily for most of a day – from 6am till around 8pm before finally needing a charge. It’s not great, but for a phone in this range I’ll take it.. Huawei definitely get props for launching the Y7 with Nougat (Android 7.0) as a base though this is offset a little with Android hidden behind that EMUI 5.1 skin. An update during the review period did bring both a security patch (April to July), an improved camera experience and better SIM card management tools. So, though a little slow, Huawei are still delivering updates to the phone.. Huawei’s chops on cameras have been hit and miss. Their higher-end phones in the Mate and P-series range from good to phenomenal with some shots, while their low to mid-range devices seem to not get the attention from Huawei’s developers that they deserve. The Y7 is very much in line with this philosophy what it can do though is take a decent, if not spectacular shot.. Shots from the 12MP camera on the Y7 aren’t going to win awards for clarity or colour reproduction, but what it does do is a utilitarian shot – it’s good enough. That said, on occasion, if you upload photos to Google Photos, the resulting composite shots can be truly good.. The one drawback on the camera front is the shutter lag. I didn’t load a lot of my usual stuff onto the phone in terms of apps, so there wasn’t a great deal running in the background, but an average 1-2 seconds shutter lag was normal for the Y7. It’s something that can be addressed in an update hopefully.. How are the low-light shots? Check these out:. Just as the rear camera can take a good shot in the right conditions, the front facing camera can too. At 8MP it’s not terribly high resolution but the faster aperture makes for a slightly better shot in some circumstances – just don’t use the beauty mode as it can get quite aggressive.. The UI on the camera can be a bit difficult to navigate. The switches to turn Flash on/off and switch from front to rear camera is obvious, but the Beauty Mode and Filters can be a bit confusing. There’s no real menu, just buttons at the top of the UI.. Video offers options up to 1080P in 16:9 aspect ratio and it’s decent quality, so there’s no issues there.. The Y7 does have some rough edges when it comes to both performance and software.. The SD435/2GB RAM combo doesn’t seem quite up to multi-tasking multiple apps. Using Pocket Casts to listen to podcasts while navigating using Google Maps made the phone both stutter and lag as well as heat up quite a bit, making that aluminium unibody heat up quite nicely to warm the hands here in Canberra.. The lag is quite pronounced, even without a full range of my usual apps installed I was left tapping my feet waiting for function to return after the system locked up. At one crucial point I pulled another phone out to take pictures due to the phone locking up for too long.. The Software, like many EMUI skins before has fallen far short of what I deem to be making a valuable change to what stock Android offers. In fact, the same issues we’ve run up against previously using EMUI, including turning off permissions for accessibility settings whenever it wants, and being a might bit aggressive when it comes to killing off ‘unused’ processes, are still present.. The killing of permissions for accessibility settings irked my ‘tater’ more than I thought it would. It was mainly in Last Pass where the option to draw over other apps was constantly turned off that I felt the pinch.. While we’re on Last Pass, having to re-enter a password rather than use fingerprint access – due to Huawei not including a fingerprint sensor on the Y7 – was annoying to say the least. How did we survive this long without fingerprint sensors? When the competition are all including fingerprint sensors, this is a major misstep.. EMUI also has a lot to answer for in terms of software usability and design.. The Huawei decision to not include an app drawer continues to baffle me. Huawei has previously modified EMUI to include an app drawer, but you won’t find one on the Y7 and, as you’ll see me saying time and time again, that’s annoying.. Folders are truncated with a 3×3 row of icons before swiping across to get to the next panel. The Quick Settings are modified from stock Android just enough to make it annoying with a single line of icons showing before needing to expand them, and the settings menu is, as usual, Huawei’s design which makes things a little harder to find for new users.. Included apps for the most part aren’t too bad, with a number of tools not included in the stock Android app install such as Sound Recorder and a fairly well laid out and feature rich File Manager.. Their theming engine is a bit of fun and can, if you work at it, hide a multitude of Huawei’s design sins, but for my money, if you buy one of these phones just install a third party launcher like Action Launcher or Nova for a much improved experience.. The story of the Y7 is very much told when looking at the competition. The competitors are, for the most part, currently offering more for either the same price, or just a little extra – more resolution, more memory, even more camera sensors – the only place the Y7 truly shines is the battery which is something.. Huawei can take pride in making great looking phones but they’re starting to feel the pinch of being at the top of the market with hungrier smartphone makers looking to offer what Huawei used to – more hardware for less.. While the Y7 is a great looking, and feeling handset, there’s just too much competition in this range. Huawei is obviously looking at the pricing, with places like Target dropping it to $249. If Huawei wants to drop the price to the sub-$200 range we’d be looking at a different story, there’s better options but it is hard to go past the Y7.. Dan is a die-hard Android fan. Some might even call him a lunatic. He's been an Android user since Android was a thing, and if there's a phone that's run Android, chances are he owns it (his Nexus collection is second-to-none) or has used it.. Dan's dedication to Ausdroid is without question, and he has represented us at some of the biggest international events in our industry including Google I/O, Mobile World Congress, CES and IFA..

This phone would be much better if it was 5″ in my opinion. Share On Facebook Share On Twitter Share On Google. Mine came with all accessories including case & earphones. Better phone at it’s price point than the review or specs would have you believe. None of its competitor handsets were available off the shelf in Brissie. My previous handset was venerable Moto g. *Dual SIM was a key selling point for me.

It’s $199 at JB-HiFI at the moment and it was $229 previously without being on special. I believe it launched at $299 but quickly dropped. I agree with you that at ~$300 there are better phones and it might be worth spending a bit more for a SD625 phone, but at $199 it’s a bit of a bargain and ticks a lot of boxes..

Hay 10 opiniones del Huawei Y7 .. Me encanta mucho este huawei pero. Me gustaria que tuviese tecnologia MHL... el equipo es muy bueno pero mi equipo no tiene una semana y se me apagado y no me prende no se si a ustedes le ha sucedido lo mismo. Ya lo he probado, lo tengo actualmente, pero verdaderamente es un buen celular, con una excelente cámara, pero tiene pequeños fallos que a la larga se vuelven peor, como por ejemplo la entrada de los manos libres, es muy distinta a las comunes y hace sonar el dispositivo con menor volumen si no es la entrada adecuada, por lo tanto no sirve para conectarlo en un equipo de sonido con un 2x1 o un 1x1. Al igual el micrófono, a veces me falla mucho el micrófono, graba con un sonido estresante, la verdad. El teléfono es bueno, pero esos son los únicos fallos que he visto hasta ahora, llevo 1 semana usándolo.. hola me pueden decir si realmente se cumple el sistema del PDAF en la camara...gracias.. Compré hace unos días un celular (Huawei Y7), me gusta mucho pero sin embargo encontré algo que no me gustó, y es que la memoria interna no se puede ampliar. Sólo puedo optimizar y pasar algunas -no todas- aplicaciones o datos simples a la memoria externa/SD. Necesito que alguien me ayude, por favor. ¿Alguien que me ayude? Se lo agradecería.. veo que el tal Marcos se ha dedicado a hacer copia y pega del mismo mensaje de queja en todas las páginas que he visitado sin aportar nada y cada vez con nombres diferentes.. Tras comparar unos 30 moviles, entre diversos precios y marcas al final me decidí por este.. en un principio iba para el Y6II pero vi muchísimas quejas y tengo la esperanza que con éste movil hayan solucionado la mayoría (como con el y3 y el y3 II) Hasta el momento casi todos los moviles que he tenido han sido LG y samsung pero gente de mi alrededor se esta pasando a Huawei y por lo que he visto (desde hace 3 años) no están nada disgustados.. Me encanta yo lo tengo y me gusta mucho su capacidad buena batería 400hap tiene buena pantalla 5.5 y buena capacidad de memoria a mi me encanta a ti no un saludo. Creo que este terminal llega tarde, ya hay terminales con esas especificaciones a precios muy bajos, por lo que se rumorea saldrá en torno a los 150€ y por menos de ese precio por ejemplo yo tengo un terminal que es bastante mejor como el Blackview P2..
