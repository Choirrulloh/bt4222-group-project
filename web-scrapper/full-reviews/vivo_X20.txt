Teardown / Vivo Phone. September 30, 2017 February 3, 2018 - by Michael - Leave a Comment. (Last updated on February 3, 2018). Vivo X20 runs Android,7.1.1 Nougat and features a 6.01 inches Super AMOLED 1080 x 2160 pixels display, a Octa-Core Qualcomm MSM8956 Plus Snapdragon 660 processor and 4GB RAM paired with and 64GB internal storage.. The Vivo X20 boasts of a 12MP main snapper at its rear and an 12MP front-facing selfie shooter. There is a Non-removable Li-Ion 3245 mAh battery powering the phone with support for USB microUSB v2.0, USB OTG and Dual SIM (Nano SIM).. For the freshest produce, find us on Facebook for the latest teardown news.. First of all, remove the SIM card tray.. SIM card tray’s upper have a sealed rubber ring, which has almost become a standard for waterproof mobile phones, but the phone as usual, there is no propaganda waterproof function.. Remove the two hex screws at the bottom of the fuselage. After the two screws removed, pry up a little bit with a suction cup, at the same time insert a pick under the back cover. Slide the pick to separate the back cover along the edge.. It is worth noting that at this point we can not completely separate the back cover, fingerprint identification cable is still connected to the fuselage. The connector is also designed with metal plate. So next, remove the retaining screw from the metal plate and remove the plate. Then disconnect the fingerprint cable connector from the motherboard. The back cover is completely separated.. From the close-up of this back cover can be seen, the whole body does use a large area of metal material, and the seal around the frame, the edge is surrounded by black seal foam. And the antenna contacts are plated with gold to prevent aging, the location of the battery is also specifically dug a slot to increase the battery capacity. Compared to the previous generation X9s, vivo X20’s back cover less large area of graphite heat paste, I do not know because of space reasons or other reasons, this generation of Snapdragon 660 chip heat control better.. All the chip metal shields are covered with copper heat sink, efficiency and cost are higher than the graphite heat paste, in addition to the two coaxial cable because of their own stability has been very high so there is no special fixed, the other connectors are covered by metal plate.. Remove the bottom plate screws, then remove the cover, you can see a large number of connectors below, a total of five, respectively, corresponding to the button, screens, battery, sub-board and data interface. And then disconnect them from the motherboard.. Then remove all the screws that can be seen around the motherboard.. Remove the dual camera connector metal plate.. When the connector and the screws are removed, we can carefully remove the motherboard from the body, the roll cage structure is displayed under the motherboard, the vibration motor and the handset are embedded inside.. We take a look at the back of the motherboard. The front camera also has a fixed by a metal plate, the light distance sensor integrated on the motherboard. Handset and dual camera position have a large area of hollowed out. The purpose is to give them as much space as possible.. Then remove the camera, you can clearly see the main camera 12MP sensor module significantly larger than the 5MP sensor module, the 5MP camera does not support auto focus, its role is to assist the completion of shooting depth photos, sorry can not be achieved through different focal lengths lossless zoom. The size of the front camera can be described as huge, it is estimated that the main camera with the same full-pixel dual-core sensor.. Most of the metal shield on the motherboard is welded, so we can not open one by one to see the inside of the chip.. Handset design is more interesting, we see it is not the location of the very top, but from the fuselage front view, the location of the sound hole is high up, how can the receiver’s voice turns?. It needs a sound guide tube design, which is the common approach for full screen handset, Sharp Aquos S1, Samsung S8 are doing so.. Then start dismantling the speaker module at the bottom, first remove all the screws. Do not know if you have not noticed the blue cover of the speaker module, the cover below is a pile of white spherical particles.. You can see from the above laser text that the product is from the AAC. In the yellow transparent film on the back of the loudspeaker, there are more white particles, I guess this should be AAC’s patented technology, intended to enhance the quality of the speaker.. Under the loudspeaker module, has two parts, one part is the data port area, the other part is a sub board area. Then remove the bottom plate, it is integrated with a headset and microphone jack. The headphone jack has a rubber seal.. Lift the bottom data interface cable a little bit, and take it out.. The data port also has rubber for sealing.. There is a green tape on the battery, according to the tips to lift the green tape, you can separate the battery. But the separation process is still a bit strenuous, because the battery has a lot of glue on the back.. Vivo X20 comes with a 3.85V, 3245mAh, 12.49Wh Li-polymer battery..

The Vivo X20 UD and its embedded fingerprint scanner is coming soon. While we didn’t see any major announces from the likes of LG or Samsung at CES 2018 , one company decided to steal the show (in my opinion). Vivo is likely a manufacturer that you really haven’t heard much of, other than the occasional interesting design choices from a device.. However, the company revealed an unnamed smartphone at CES which was the first to feature a fingerprint scanner which was embedded in the display. Details were scarce regarding the potential release of this device, let alone the name, but it seems that some of those questions have been answered.. The Vivo X20 UD has passed through TENAA certifications in China, with the embedded fingerprint scanner in-tow. The device features a 6.43-inch FHD+ OLED display, and takes full advantage of the new Synaptics sensor embedded in the display.. It seems that instead of launching a new lineup of devices, Vivo will throw the X20 UD under the X20 lineup, as the device features all of the same specs as the X20 Plus. This means that the X20 UD will be powered by the Snapdragon 660 chipset, which has been coupled with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.. The X20 UD will also feature a dual-camera setup with a primary 12MP sensor and a secondary 5MP sensor. The front-facing camera will feature a 5MP sensor, and all of this is wrapped in a sleek and slender design.. We still don’t know when Vivo will officially unveil the X20 UD and make it available for purchase, but it’s unlikely that the device will launch in the US. This just means we’ll have to continue waiting for a US-based OEM to get everything together to bring us an embedded fingerprint scanner..

Vivo X20 Plus launches with in-display fingerprint sensor and I want one. It's 2018 and you can buy a phone with a fingerprint sensor underneath the display.. We saw a lot of crazy tech at this year's CES , and while I wasn't personally in Vegas to check out everything first-hand, one of the products that caught my attention the most was the Vivo X20 Plus – or, as it's more commonly known, the first phone with a fingerprint sensor underneath its display .. The Vivo X20 Plus made its way through China's TENAA earlier this month, and just a couple days later, the phone is now ready for prime-time. Although pricing details have yet to be announced, pre-orders will officially open in China at some point today, January 24.. Vivo's main selling point with the X20 Plus is definitely the fingerprint sensor tech, but the rest of the phone isn't a slouch by any means. The screen is a 6.43-inch OLED panel with a resolution of 2160 x 1080 and 18:9 aspect ratio, two 12MP cameras can be found on the back, the Snapdragon 635 is powering the phone, and a 3,905 mAh battery should offer more than enough stamina.. If the Vivo X20 Plus is the future of biometric security, sign me up.. It's unclear if/when the Vivo X20 Plus will make its way out of Chinese markets, but that hasn't stopped me from desperately wanting to get my hands on the thing. The rear-mounted fingerprint sensor on my Pixel 2 works just fine, but the little nerd in me can't help but jump for joy at the fact that this technology is actually available in a phone that people can buy.. The X20 Plus likely won't ever come to the U.S., and while that is a bummer, it's only a matter of time before more OEMs follow suit. Vivo might be the first company to ship a phone with a fingerprint sensor underneath the display, but it won't be the last.. It still remains to be seen if this new fingerprint sensor tech offers any real consumer benefits over what we've had on our phones for years at this point, but even if it functionally works just the same, that's perfectly fine by me. If I can place my finger on a screen, have it properly register the biometrics, and unlock my phone, I'll be more than happy.. Now that my little rant is over, what are your thoughts on phones with in-display fingerprint sensors?. Vivo's in-display fingerprint sensor shows the future of smartphone biometrics. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.
