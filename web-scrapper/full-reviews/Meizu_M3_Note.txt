By anil baweja | 24 May 2016. I think you, at the Ndtv Tech team need to re-look the specs of the Meizu m3 note - as this handset does support the 4G LTE band 40 used by some 4G service providers in India [plus Volte ]- your detailed specs say: it does not support band 40.. Please confirm if i am correct or the specs are right.. At rs.9999/- for the 3gb ram and 32gb version plus an high EER MT helioP10 cpu,4100 mah battery and Nippon Electric Glass,Japan - Dinorex,impact & scratch resistant screen and very good build quality - it seems like a good buy.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. posted by Luis D.. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction Unfamiliar to most of the world, Meizu is prominent in its homeland of China where local users have been welcoming the brand's MX, PRO, and M series of handsets. While the former are meant to be the best smartphones Meizu is capable of building, the M series is where the company experiments with delivering the most value possible at a sub-$199 price. The M series' third-generation flagship device – the M3 Note – goes all out, promising high-end smartphone features like a metal body, a big display, above average performance, a competent camera, and superb battery life. Meizu's undertaking surely has us intrigued with its "too good to be true" character, and by the end of this review, we'll know exactly how much the M3 Note fulfills the brand's ambitions. Design A clean-looking and sturdy metal phone with a bit more bulk than what you might expect. With a 6000 Series aluminum back and a sleek glass-covered front, the Meizu M3 Note is sturdy and good-looking, but also slightly bulky. At 5.75 oz (163 g), it carries a fair bit of heft, and with its 0.32in (8.2mm) thickness, the handset looks unabashedly plump next to the skinny smartphones of today. Still, the Meizu is comfortable to hold and using it one-handed is a legitimate possibility thanks to its balanced proportions. We also like how the camera on the back is flush with the body, and the antenna lines are incorporated in an aesthetically pleasant way. The M3 Note features a Home button below the display that doubles as a 'Back' navigation key and fingerprint sensor, a typical move by Meizu. The fingerprint scanner is very fast and accurate, but like the power and volume keys to the right, the Home button feels a bit soft and wobbly. Display An adequate screen that has room for improvement. The Meizu M3 Note features a 5.5-inch, 1080p resolution IPS LCD display that's of decent quality, though the panel comes off as a tad on the dimmer side under bright sunlight, which is one of its main shortcomings. Gamma and color balance are close to where they need to be, but there's a bit of a purple tinge that can be a bit distracting.. 6.05 x 2.97 x 0.32 inches. 153.6 x 75.5 x 8.2 mm. 5.91 x 2.99 x 0.34 inches. 150 x 76 x 8.65 mm. 5.96 x 3 x 0.32 inches. 151.3 x 76.3 x 8.15 mm. 5.98 x 2.94 x 0.27 inches. 151.9 x 74.6 x 6.9 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The numbers below represent the amount of deviation in the respective property, observed when a display is viewed from a 45-degree angle as opposed to direct viewing.. Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Meizu M3 Note Compare.

(Posts: 275; Member since: 29 Jun 2012). posted on 09 Jun 2016, 11:42. The Helio P10 is a BAD chipset for multimedia compared to something like the SD801 of ZUK Z1 and Galaxy S5, and that's a TWO year old chip!!! CPU performance for camera and Tumblr is roughly on par, but GPU performance of Helio is laughable versus the ancient Adreno, the P10 is horrible for Goat Simulator, Asphalt 8, and QUIK video editor! (Granted, XRN3 scores better in CPU benchmarks but GPU running is on par.). (Posts: 134; Member since: 22 Apr 2012). posted on 09 Jun 2016, 10:08. Stinson before me: I'd really like to know how the XIAOMI Redmi Note 3 Pro with SD650 score here. Sure flaws can be found, but LG G4 power with fp scanner for 170USD?. (Posts: 536; Member since: 20 Nov 2014). posted on 09 Jun 2016, 11:40. 6.5 redmi note 3 is better in every way at the same price and get 6.5...haha. (Posts: 444; Member since: 30 Jul 2014). posted on 09 Jun 2016, 10:45.

(Posts: 787; Member since: 04 May 2015). posted on 09 Jun 2016, 11:26. So the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro gets a 6.5 and the Meizu 7? You guys are a joke.. (Posts: 237; Member since: 04 May 2016). posted on 09 Jun 2016, 22:36. same as other commentators, you guys at PA really hates Xiaomi for sure. where is the cons "hard to get outside China?" lols.

I bet they cant mention any phone thats better than this one or xiaomi's at this price range (and have better score review), lol.. yet, they gave it some s**tty score, they obviously hate china brands. (Posts: 6747; Member since: 30 Sep 2014). posted on 09 Jun 2016, 23:22. btw, they recommend VIVO 5 which have far inferior CPU, 720p screen, and worse battery life, and ZF2 also similar with VIVO 5.

(Posts: 1; Member since: 10 Jun 2016). posted on 10 Jun 2016, 05:07. i am using this phone for the past few days now hence what i say is based on actual experience. Agree fully with the reviewer, this one deserves an applause. I have used a variety of phones till date and this one surely makes the top 3. Granted it does not have the powerhouse performance but a majority of the people out there just want something which feels good in the hands and does the job without making a fuss (read heating like an iron). Flyme OS is really intuitive and it is defiantly going in the correct direction. I just hope more people adapt to it so that it gets the limelight it deserves. Looking forward to the M4 note now.

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Macro mode, Effects. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor.

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

As an economic policy the efficacy of this approach is debatable; however, it works well enough when applied to technology. With each passing year, the quality and performance of lower-cost phones improves. Not that long ago, buying a low-end phone meant a compromised user experience, the result of corner cutting to reduce cost. But today it’s possible to get a very capable phone for less than ¥1300 (about $200 USD) that does not list frustration as its primary feature. The last phone we tested at this price point was the Huawei Honor 5X , and while not perfect, it left an overall positive impression.. In this article, we’ll be examining two of its competitors: the Meizu M3 note and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. The similarities between these two phones extend beyond their “note” branding; they also share very similar hardware specifications and pricing, which is why we’re going to review them together. It will be interesting to see if these similarities translate to a similar user experience.. Both phones come in two basic versions: one with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage and a slightly more expensive configuration that bumps RAM to 3GB and storage to 32GB. The base configuration is pretty typical for this category, and while 2GB of RAM should be enough to provide a decent multitasking experience, having only 16GB of storage is a bit restrictive. Thankfully, both phones support microSD cards for adding storage space.. Other hardware similarities exist too, including a 5.5-inch 1080p IPS display, a 5MP front-facing camera, and a rear camera with phase detect autofocus (PDAF) and dual-tone LED flash. Both phones also support 802.11ac Wi-Fi, which is nice to see considering the Huawei Honor 5X only supports up to 802.11n and only with 2.4GHz channels, although neither includes NFC support. The Redmi Note 3 does have an FM radio and an infrared transmitter for TV remote duties, features the M3 note lacks.. The adoption rate for fingerprint sensors has been incredibly quick. It has only been a couple of years since fingerprint sensors first appeared on flagship phones, but now it’s a near ubiquitous feature from flagships down to the upper low-end. The M3 note uses a capacitive touch-based fingerprint sensor based on Meizu’s mTouch 2.1 technology that is also found in the more expensive PRO 5 and PRO 6. The Redmi Note 3 also comes with a capacitive touch-based sensor on the back of the phone. Both phones unlock quickly, but I found the M3 note’s sensor to be far more reliable, especially at handling moisture and changes in temperature. At one point I could not even get the Redmi Note 3 to register a fingerprint during the enrollment process.. One feature that helps set both of these phones apart from their peers is a large battery. While not swappable, the greater than 4000mAh battery in each phone should provide ample battery life, something we’ll quantify later in the review.. The biggest difference between these two notes is the SoC each packs inside. The MediaTek Helio P10 in the M3 note uses an octa-core CPU with a performance and power-saving cluster of four Cortex-A53 cores each for a total of eight cores. The Snapdragon 650 in the Redmi Note 3 pairs its power-saving cluster of four A53 cores with two Cortex-A72 cores, which should give it a performance advantage in most applications. There’s also two different GPUs—an ARM Mali-T860MP2 for the M3 note and a Qualcomm Adreno 510 for the Redmi Note 3—which have their own relative strengths.. Besides the different core configurations, each SoC also uses a different manufacturing process. Both are based on TSMC’s 28nm node, but the Snapdragon 650 uses 28nm HPm while the MediaTek Helio P10 uses the newer 28nm HPC+, which promises a significant reduction in leakage current relative to the HPm and HPC iterations that precede it. Implementation details, along with software optimizations and configuration settings, also play a significant role when it comes to SoC power and performance, so we’ll have to see what impact this has on battery life later in the review.. Both SoCs include an integrated baseband processor. MediaTek’s Category 6 LTE modem offers up to 300 Mb/s down and 50 Mb/s up with 2x20 MHz carrier aggregation and 64-QAM on the downlink. Qualcomm’s X8 LTE modem in the Redmi Note 3’s Snapdragon 650 SoC offers the same downlink capability but boosts uplink speed to 100 Mb/s max by adding 2x20 MHz carrier aggregation (still 16-QAM).. Both phones support Dual SIM Dual Standby (DSDS) operation, which means both SIMs are active for receiving calls or messages, but only one SIM can make a connection at a time because they share a single radio. Each phone’s card tray has two slots: The M3 note can have two NanoSIM cards or one NanoSIM and one microSD card, while the Redmi Note 3 can use one MicroSIM and one NanoSIM or one MicroSIM and one microSD card.. Frequency band support is tailored for the Asian and European markets, although neither phone supports B20 for the latter. There’s no support for North American LTE frequencies, limiting the phones to HSPA+ operation.. Camera Hardware, Photo & Video Quality. Please log in or sign up to comment.. Pissedoffyouth - Tuesday, July 12, 2016 - link. I have a Redmi Note 3 and I generally get >8h SOT over 2 days. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone. It's just a pity they can't stick bigger batteries in phones that cost 3x as much. Le Geek - Tuesday, July 12, 2016 - link. I know right!!! I too have the same phone and never have I gotten a sot less than 9 hrs. This device is turning out to be the best Tech purchase I've ever made. ddriver - Tuesday, July 12, 2016 - link. They can, just don't want to. JeffFlanagan - Tuesday, July 12, 2016 - link. They don't want to because it would be a bad choice. This way people who want a bulkier phone with longer battery-life can get a battery-case, and people who want a thinner phone at the cost of battery-life can skip the case. The alternative is a bulky phone that's only appealing to people who need a larger battery, so have to put up with a larger device. TechnikalKP - Wednesday, July 13, 2016 - link. The iPhone 6+ is 7.3mm thick. The Redmi Note 3 is 8.6mm. That's less than the thickness of a US dime. close - Wednesday, July 13, 2016 - link. Bulky? Compared to what? Compared to the thinnest flagships maybe. But compare it to anything any normal person would consider acceptable and it's nowhere near bulky. I've never heard anyone saying "oh I wish this phone wasn't so bulky" when talking about normal phone thickness in the past years. Battery complaints though? All the time. What's the ideal thickness? The S6 Edge was 7mm while the S7 is 7.7mm. So adding 10% to the thickness didn't raise any eyebrows. Yes, putting a bigger battery would be a bad choice for all kinds of ignorant people thinking that a battery case is the same as adding an extra mm to the thickness of the phone and also for phone manufacturers who know that a battery that barely lasts a day when new will push you to get a new phone when the battery is 2 years old and you spend most of the day tethered to an outlet. Spunjji - Thursday, July 14, 2016 - link. My Nexus 5 was almost useless to me after 18 months; by 2 years I was charging it 2 or 3 times a day. I can't believe for a second that one or two additional millimeters for 10 to 25% additional battery capacity would have been a bad choice for that device, what with it being very thin already and having a stupid camera bump. Battery cases are a terrible solution - they are restricted to a single device, add unnecessary bulk and increase the complexity of charging. Impulses - Thursday, July 14, 2016 - link. I was on the same boat, recently decided to open it up and swap the battery as I'm keeping it until the next round of Nexus at year'd end. I hope even the next 5" model goes for at least a 3000mAh (and/or wireless charging)... Otherwise I might be looking at larger phones which I've resisted all these years. Bulat Ziganshin - Wednesday, July 20, 2016 - link. The new battery for Nexus4 costs me $10 at aliexpress. Impulses - Thursday, July 14, 2016 - link. A battery case isn't really comparable, or even a viable choice I'd argue. They're only made for a handful of flagship models, and they add a lot more bulk relative to the battery life you gain (and compared with phones that have larger batteries and are just a mm thicker)...

Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The new Meizu m3 note includes an all-metal body.. The m3 note has been priced at Rs. One of the biggest highlights of m3 note is it supports multi-window.. Chinese handset maker Meizu on Wednesday unveiled its new m3 note smartphone in India. At an event in New Delhi, Meizu showcased the new m-series smartphone which brings a host of improvements over its predecessor, the Meizu m2 note. Some of the improvements in the new Meizu m3 note include an all-metal body, a new fingerprint scanner, multi-window support, and a larger battery. The m3 note features a 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) LTPS screen with a pixel density of 403ppi. Zhang added that the screen has a high contrast ratio of 1000:1 and is bright at 450 nits.. Leon Zhang, Marketing Head, Meizu India, also talked about how the brand has grown in India since its debut. The company claimed it now has over 100 service centres and also introduced a new WhatsApp service for Meizu users. At the event, we spent some time with the Meizu m3 note and here are our first impressions.. To start off, the Meizu m3 note doesn't really look anything the company has launched before. Zhang noted that the m3 note was the first all-metal m-series smartphone. The device sports a unibody design and is made of 6000 series aluminium alloy. The front is dominated by the screen which sports 2.5D curved glass. There is a physical home button as well, with an embedded fingerprint scanner. You'll also see a camera, earpiece, and sensors above the display.. The rear has antenna bands running along the top and bottom. The primary camera is placed in the centre and is accompanied by a dual-LED flash. The Meizu logo is embossed lower down. The power and volume buttons are on the right, while the left has the SIM card and microSD card slot. The 3.5mm audio jack is on top, while charging port and speakers are on the bottom.. Overall, the m3 note looks like a solid device and fits well in hand. The device definitely feels sturdier than the m2 note which was all plastic. Despite featuring a 5.5-inch screen, the m3 note was easy to use with just one hand. The physical home button was easy reachable with our thumb.. The handset is powered by an octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 SoC (four 1.8GHz Cortex-A53 cores and four 1GHz Cortex-A53 cores, plus Mali-T860 graphics) which the company claimed offers 125 percent better graphics performance compared to the m2 note. The 4100mAh battery is one of the highlights of this device.. Meizu had launched two variants of the m3 note in China, one with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of inbuilt storage, and the other with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of inbuilt storage. The company has brought only the latter variant to India.. During our limited time with the handset, the Meizu m3 note handled multitasking and app switching pretty easily without any lag. For connectivity, the smartphone supports 4G on both SIMs. The company claims that the m3 note supports 6 modes and 18 frequency bands, including Indian LTE bands.. The physical home button on the m3 note smartphone also works as a back button, just like the one on the Meizu m2 note. The Marketing Head of Meizu India explained during his keynote that users have to tap the home button to go back, while pressing it will take them to the homescreen. Unfortunately, we couldn't test the fingerprint sensor on the phone at the launch.. The Meizu m3 note runs Flyme 5 OS based on Android 5.1 Lollipop and the company touted that it brings several improvements over Flyme 4.5. Meizu said that power consumption has decreased by up to 32 percent on m3 note running Flyme 5 compared to the m2 note.. One of the biggest highlights of the Flyme 5 is multi-window support, which splits the screen in two halves and allows users to perform two functions simultaneously. On the m3 note, users will have to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to access their recently opened apps, and the multi-window option appears on one of the app cards. The first half of the screen shows the app which was in use while the second half can be used for another app.. Some of the other enhancements that Flyme 5 brings are a revamped Gallery app which can now sort photos based on time or place; a new Wi-Fi doctor feature that can attempt to fix problems with connections, and new Quick Share feature that allows data to be transferred at 17Mbps through Wi-Fi. Some other features of Flyme 5 are an inbuilt storage cleaner, a RAM optimiser, and an anti-virus tool.. The company at the event also announced that the Flyme 5 will be rolling out to all Meizu smartphones launched in India this year.. The smartphone sports a 13-megapixel rear camera with an f/2.2 aperture and phase-detection autofocus. It also features Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for lens protection. There is a 5-megapixel front-facing camera with an f/2.0 aperture as well. The images we took in artificial indoor lighting seemed vibrant with good colour reproduction. Low light shots taken with the m3 note seemed above average. The front 5-megapixel camera also produced decent-looking samples. We will however reserve our verdict on the phone's overall performance and camera quality till we get the chance to put it through our detailed review process.. 9,999, the Meizu m3 note definitely looks like a great package and will give tough competition to other competitors in the price segment including the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (2GB RAM model), LeEco Le 1s Eco , and the Coolpad Note 3 Plus ..

Can you tell me the version. BarryBear, 17 Sep 2017 This was a good phone until I accidentally accepted the switch to flyme 6.1.0.0G.. more Yes I must agree, they have turned the best value for money phone into absolute rubbish. Warning to all DO NIT UP DATE OPERATING SYSTEM!. I loved this phone and campained to to my friends and colleagues not I wouldn't recommend the the Brand to anyone at all. Shame the Meizu M3 Note was the best phone I have ever owned till the update now it's as good as a $30 garbage throw away phone... Real shame on the Meizu brand!. Best phone I have every owned for a year and a half... Till the latest FlyMe operating system updates, now I want to smash my phone several times a day! It's is so frustrating after enjoying such a great phone, excellent value for money, $350 for a phone that is comparable to a $800 phone now it's as good as $60 Huawei. DO NOT UP DATE THE FLY ME OPERATING SYSTEWILWILYou will end up hating one of the best phones available. My only explanation for this is they "meizu" is dumping down their older models so they can sell the new models but in my opinion they have put me off a brand that I have campained and praised to my friend and colleagues to one I will worn people not to buy. so many reviews of how great the keyboard and auto correct is but since the up date it's almost impossible to used running words together if you deleted a single letter it's mashes the last 3 words into one mess. Shame on Meizu and FlyMe! This k by wrecking my phone it will make me buy a new one made by you... Doubt it, you have converted a patriot to your brand unto a hater that will worn people of the faults and floors, and with the current OP these phones are over priced u can buy rubbish phones for $39 why pay $300 for rubbish!. Anonymous, 21 Oct 2017 Update 6.7.4.11g beta it's very good battery back up is very good no hitting issues. Is there an android 7.0 Nougat update to the m3 note? and how to do it?. maruthike, 24 Jun 2017 Meizu m3 note is supported jio sim..... very good phone with unique home button having back plus fingerprint sensor. love it really what an device from meizu. sabin, 09 Oct 2017 iam using this phone 1 year.but so heat.how to solve this Update 6.7.4.11g beta it's very good battery back up is very good no hitting issues.. iam using this phone 1 year.but so heat.how to solve this. This was a good phone until I accidentally accepted the switch to flyme 6.1.0.0G. Ever since then, the phone gets really hot when I use it for more that 3 minutes (including phone calls).

Meizu claims that this version of Flyme UI 5 brings lot of polish but our experience was not good. Meizu m3 note could have got one thing right – speakers.. Updated: May 31, 2016 3:13 pm. Meizu M6s launched with 18:9 display, Samsung Exynos 7872. processor Meizu M6 Note India launch soon, company puts out teaser on. Twitter Meizu Pro 7, Pro 7 Plus with secondary screen, dual cameras launched: Price, key. Meizu, the Chinese smartphone maker, is riding high on the success of its m series budget smartphones. Considering the diverse option available, it is really difficult to gain traction in the budget space. Meizu claims to have sold over 20 million m series smartphones, which is not a small number by any means.. Meizu is banking on the success of its previous offering and has introduced m3 note in India. Meizu says it has brought the budget smartphone to India within days of its China launch, which proves how much of a priority India is for the company.. Meizu m3 note is the successor to m2 note and the most direct competitor yet to Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 — note the note in the names.. Meizu m3 note has a design very similar to m2 note, which itself is similar to Apple iPhone. The smartphone has a really big 4100mAh battery and metal unibody design, similar to Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. What sets the m3 note apart, however, is the significantly cheaper price tag. So is this the best smartphone under Rs 10,000? Let’s find out in our review. Specs: 5.5-inch Full HD display | 1.8GHz octa-core Mediatek MT6755 Helio P10 processor | 3GB RAM | 32GB storage space (expandable to 128GB) | 13MP rear camera, 5MP front camera | 4100mAh battery | Android 5.1 Lollipop. Meizu m3 note has one of the best industrial designs among smartphones priced under Rs 10,000. It has metal unibody construction with nice chamfered edges. The silver colour review unit had a striking look, and many even confused it for the iPhone 6 Plus.. Meizu m3 note has only a single navigation button called mBack. The mBack button acts as Home button, fingerprint scanner and back button. Again it’s an idea taken from iPhone design, but added with extra features. The whole implementation is very neat and works flawlessly.. The Meizu m3 note has a battery that will be the envy any kinds of smartphone in the price range. I used Meizu m3 note as my primary smartphone and was easily able to push it over two-and-a-half days. The screen on time was over seven hours every single day, and the usage involved calls, messaging, social media, video streaming and little gameplay.. My usage does sound a lot but the 4,100mAh Lithium battery under the hood just lasts longer. An average user can easily get around three days of juice from this one while heavy users can leave home their charger for a day. It matches Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 3 nicely when it comes to battery backup.. Meizu m3 note packs a 5.5-inch Full HD display upfront which offers nice detail, sharper texts and good colour reproduction. However, the auto brightness did not work well and especially under Delhi’s direct sunlight, the brightness needs to be maxed out. Even at maximum brightness, Meizu m3 note lasts longer thanks to its big battery.. My colleague was not really impressed with Xiaomi Redmi Note 3’s camera and I must say Meizu has managed to better Xiaomi on that front. Meizu m3 note’s camera is quick to focus and it manages to reproduce great amount of detail almost every time.. It offers tonnes of options like 6-second gifs and the ability to refocus the image using light field mode after it’s shot. These are nice features to have but you won’t be using it that often. However, the manual mode works reliably well. It has a maximum ISO of 1600 and shutter speed of 16 seconds. The pictures shot in manual mode or using long exposure setting are not as breathtaking as it would be on a DSLR. It is still a cool feature, something you would use quite often.. Meizu m3 note comes with 32GB storage out of the box which is the maximum you can get at this price. If you prefer larger storage space, Meizu m3 note should be the one you consider.. Meizu m3 note runs Flyme UI 5 based on Android 5.1 and we exclusively reported that there is no Marshmallow update on the cards any time soon. The latest operating system means latest security, which Meizu m3 note will miss badly.. Coming back to Flyme UI 5 itself, Meizu claims this version brings lot of polish but my experience was not good. I often saw crashes and some of the UI animations rendered too slow. Very simple things like card-based multitasking didn’t always appear while swiping from the bottom of the screen. Also some of the most common options are hidden, and take time to figure out. I believe this is not the best UI Meizu has ever built.. Meizu mocked every other manufacturer implementing rear fingerprint scanner in their devices as wearing underwear reverse. I feel its own device has worn the wrong underwear altogether. To be specific, the fingerprint scanner (referred as underwear) is too moody and often failed to register my fingerprint. An issue, unheard of in a device priced as cheaply as Coolpad Note 3 Lite.. Meizu m3 note is powered by a MediaTek Helio P10 processor, which is not a bad processor for smartphone in this class, but isn’t as powerful as the Snapdragon 650 found under the hood of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. That Snapdragon chipset makes for an advanced performance and better graphics performance.. Meizu m3 note could have got one thing right – speakers. The speaker set on this one sounds too tinny and won’t work even at your basic house party. Small things that matter over time.. With Meizu being my primary smartphone last week, I had only one feeling – a great design that gets basics wrong. A great hardware with poor software can make the whole experience underwhelming. Meizu m3 note fits in this category.. I would forgive Meizu for not bringing Marshmallow update (read: most Android phones are still stuck on KitKat) but what they are offering right now needs to learn a great deal to be really useful and effective.. Get Meizu if you want a great design, good storage space, very good camera and days long battery at such a low price. But if you want to be in the ring of latest software goodness, better to look elsewhere.. For all the latest Technology News , download Indian Express App. © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd.

Meizu m3 note review: Could've been better. After decent budget packages, the m1 note and m2 note, the m3 note from Meizu is quite an aberration from the predecessors, and aims to pack in solid internals in a stylish chassis. There are a few highlights like design and build quality with extended battery life, yet it fails to impress in overall performance.. I used the Indian retail variant of the Meizu m3 note that ran Flyme OS running on top of Android Lollipop 5.1 out of the box. For most of the time, I used it with an Airtel 4G SIM in Delhi NCR.. The Meizu m3 note features a metal body, a pleasant departure from the plastic finish of its predecessors. The subtly curved rear panel looks quite nice and aids the grip. The design of the m3 note is clearly inspired from the iPhone 6 – it's ordinary, but pleasant to look at and exudes premium style. Crafted out of aluminum, the all-metal smartphone feels great in the hand. The 2.5D curved display is a nice touch, and makes the phone thinner on the edges improving the handling.. At 153.6 x 75.5 x 8.2mm, the Meizu m3 note is a tad bigger and a few grams heavier than its predecessor but it sports a thoughtful design, and is nicely built. It's not light, but boasts of a solid construction. Having used Meizu devices since a while, I quite like the mTouch home button. It's practical for navigation and now doubles up as a fingerprint sensor.. Powered by the Helio P10 octa-core processor with 3GB of RAM, the m3 note does okay for a mid-range smartphone. The Mali-T860 MP2 GPU is uninspiring though and throttles the overall performance. It's got enough punch to handle everyday usage, but is definitely behind the curve and should've been better. There are occasional hangs and crashes, and I couldn't pin it to Flyme OS or sluggish hardware. Things aren't too bad, but like I said, if it was better, I would've had no doubts recommending this phone. Now, I'm not sure if it's the right choice for a power user.. 5.5-inch Full HD (1080 x 1920) IPS LCD. MediaTek Helio P10 octa-core Cortex-A53 processor (4x1.8GHz + 4x1.0GHz). 16GB; expandable via a microSD slot. The Meizu m3 note does the basics well. The reception bars were full and it held onto signal – even in low network spots – and the call quality is good as well. There's no FM Radio or NFC though, and the former is a no go for a lot of users in India.. The m3 note also incorporates a fingerprint sensor within its single hardware key – the mTouch button - on the front. It works good enough, and I prefer it over a fingerprint sensor on the back like most mid-range smartphones.. The Meizu m3 note sports a 5.5-inch Full HD IPS display with a 2.5D curved glass design. The latter makes the phone look a little thinner improving the aesthetics while removing the sharp edges. There's also the Dinorex T2X-1 scratch-resistant glass protecting the display.. The display is a mixed bag of sorts. The colors are bright and vibrant, but the contrast isn't the best. However, the 1080p display with 403ppi is sharp enough and looks pretty good for its price. The viewing angles too are just average. Sunlight legibility is poor since the screen is quite reflective and on most occasions outdoors, you'll be able to barely see what's on your screen.. Overall, the display combined with the design makes the m3 note a very good looking phone on first glance. There are definite misses on the display but most of them are what most users won't complain about.. The Meizu m3 note runs Flyme OS on top of outdated Android Lollipop 5.1. Surprisingly for an Android phone, the standard Google apps are missing, and you have to head to the Google Play Store to download them. It's an additional step, and not much of a drawback.. Flyme OS offers pretty straightforward user experience. Once you've gotten your bearings, you find Flyme OS to be very fluid and responsive aided by the mTouch navigation paradigm that we've seen before in Meizu devices.. There's a unique home key without the usual capacitive buttons or the on-screen keys to go along with it. The home key can register both touch responses as well as presses. So if you are in the settings menu for example, touching the key would take you back one step backward and pressing it would take you back to the home screen. mTouch button brings added functionality but could be confusing at first if you're coming from traditional Android experience with three navigation buttons. Once you get a hang of it, and of course you will, you'll be at home using mTouch experience with Flyme OS.. Flyme OS supports multi-view offering split-screen viewing, although it's limited to only a few apps like News, Video, Settings, Documents, and Smart Voice. Hopefully, this list will grow with the next software updates. There's also Gesture wake up to allow pre-defined gestures to launch different apps while your phone is asleep as well as a Do Not Disturb mode that blocks notifications and calls while you can set a whitelist of numbers that can get through. There's also a helpful Toolbox app that packs utilities like a flashlight, a mirror, compass, level, ruler, and magnifier as well as the Security app that lets you scan for viruses, clean junk files, keep an eye on your large files, manage your data traffic, and control permissions for each app.. Meizu offers a Smart Touch feature for single-handed operation of the rather big 5.5-inch smartphone. There's a virtual 4-way key that can be assigned different functionality to each of the directions, tap and hold, tap, and double tap. I spent a little time with it, carefully configuring it, and that now allows me to control the m3 note with just one hand for almost everything.. Meizu m3 note Battery life. The m3 note boasts of an impressive 4100 mAh battery – about 30% more than its predecessor. That's a big upgrade, making the battery life one of the highlights of this budget device. The Meizu m3 note offers solid uptime on a single charge, and can easily last for day and a half on moderate usage.. Even for a power user like me, I would have some juice left at the end of a working day. While switching from Performance Power mode to Balanced mode, you'd be able to squeeze in a few more hours easily.. The Meizu m3 note packs a 13-megapixel camera sensor with dual-tone LED flash, the latter allowing for more pleasing colors in low-light photos taken with flash.. Although there's advanced PDAF auto-focus, the photos are inconsistent. Sometimes the photos turn out to be blurred or I had to select the focus point manually because the autofocus went haywire. When it does, the m3 note takes decent photos with accurate color reproduction as well as nice contrast ratio. The HDR mode brings more details in the highlights and the shadows, and I preferred it over the Auto mode. The overall image quality though is marred by additive noise and several samples I shot turned out to be grainy. At similar price points, both Lenovo K5 Plus and Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 click superior photos with more details and better processing.. The 5-megapixel front camera though fares much better. There's enough details in your selfies and the colors are good enough. The Meizu m3 note shoots videos up to 1080p resolution at 30fps. The captured videos turn out to be just about decent with limited details.. The camera offers several shooting modes apart from the usual Auto, Macro, and Manual modes. There's a Beauty mode which makes eyes bigger, face slimmer, and adds glow to your face (ugh!), a Panorama mode, a Light field mode allowing you to defocus any part of a scene, Scan mode to read QR codes and barcodes, as well as a Slow motion mode.. Meizu m3 note Bottom line. Should you buy it? Probably. There are very few notable omissions in the Meizu m3 note. There's no fast charging and Android Lollipop in 2016 hurts, and there are several misses here and there. Yet, the m3 note looks like a well-rounded package and at first glance, impresses a lot of budget-conscious users.. The Meizu m3 note is really a mixed bag. It's nicely designed with solid construction, and the battery life is excellent. But the overall performance and camera quality is average. I'm inclined to like this phone and it feels good in hand, but at ₹9,999 ($147), Meizu should've done a better job. If you are a power user, the m3 note will disappoint you, but for most regular users, the performance hit would just be okay if you prefer a nice phone to flaunt and warm up to mTouch..

Samsung Galaxy S9 arrives today: 5 things to know. The State of 5G: When It's Coming, How Fast It Will Be & The Sci-Fi Future It Will Enable. Samsung unveils its camera-focused Galaxy S9 handsets. A second save slot in Metal Gear Survive costs $10. Meet the $170 5.5-inch Meizu m3. A Budget Smartphone with Plenty to. Meizu is one of many Chinese smartphone manufacturers that have seen strong success in their home country, but have struggled to break into Western markets in the highly crowded budget smartphone space. Their devices are known for packing in a great array of hardware at an extremely low price, rivalling well-known Chinese giant Xiaomi in this regard.. The phone I have with me today is the Meizu m3 Note, a 5.5-inch budget device with an attractive price tag of just $170. This places it in direct competition with one of my favorite budget devices, the 3rd-generation Motorola Moto G , along with the mediocre Umi Touch I reviewed a couple of weeks ago.. The m3 Note could fall into the trap of offering good hardware but failing to use it properly; it’s a common thread among budget Chinese OEMs. However, with Meizu having produced smartphones since the early days of Android, the company has had years to refine their offerings. The m3 Note in particular is the third device in Meizu’s large screen series, which began in late 2014 with the launch of the original m1 Note .. I’ll be looking at the hardware in greater detail later, but there’s a lot of quality in this device at its price. There’s a 1080p IPS LCD on the front, an octa-core Helio P10 SoC on the inside, a huge 4,100 mAh battery, a fingerprint sensor, and a 13-megapixel rear camera. This sounds like a pretty decent collection of hardware for a sub-$200 handset.. I’m not mincing words when I say this: the Meizu m3 Note has the best build quality of any budget device I’ve used. The m3 Note could easily sit among flagship smartphone, such is the quality of this metal body. It’s not the most visually impressive handset – Meizu’s design team has clearly used the iPhone 6s Plus as inspiration for this build – but there is no shortage of premium materials or attention to detail here.. Most of the m3 Note’s back is a single piece of 6000-series aluminium, which comfortably curves around each of the long edges to create a near-unibody design. It’s rare for a budget device to use such nice metal, and it both looks and feels superb here. I especially like the clean, sleek look that Meizu has implemented, allowing you to enjoy the materials without intrusive branding or clutter.. The Meizu m3 Note sitting next to a 3rd-generation Motorola Moto G. Above and below this metal slab are two plastic sections designed to imitate the rest of the metal body. As these sections are separated by a neat, polished strip of metal, I don’t think they look too bad. The plastic sections certainly don’t have the same textural qualities of the metal, however in normal use you don’t have to touch these areas, and visually they fit in acceptably with the overall design of the m3 Note.. One of the things I really appreciate about the m3 Note’s design is the attention to detail. The build is near-perfectly symmetrical, which shows Meizu has really thought about the placement of some elements, like the camera and sensors above the display. The lack of noticeable seams speaks volumes about the solidness of this build, which translates to a great feel in your hands. These are the sort of things you typically see from high-end devices, not budget devices.. The solid volume rocker and power button are found in a comfortable location along the right-hand edge. In general, this phone is very ergonomic, thanks to comfortable curves around each of the edges and corners. I was also pleased with the thickness (8.2mm) and weight (163 grams), which is nothing groundbreaking but respectable considering there’s a huge 4,100 mAh battery inside.. Interestingly, the m3 Note is smaller and lighter than the iPhone 6s Plus in every way bar depth (the 6s Plus is 1mm thinner). Both phones have 5.5-inch displays, yet smaller bezels on the m3 Note make it slightly easier to use in one hand. Neither device is particularly friendly to those with small hands, though, as the display size is still above average.. The m3 Note is loaded with two speakers along the bottom edge, which as you might expect aren’t great quality. Between the speakers is a micro-USB port, the standard port used for charging and data transfers in budget devices. I don’t expect USB-C to filter down to these devices for a while now, so I have no complaints there. Along the top is a 3.5mm headphone jack, and on the left edge is a tray for housing either two nano-SIMs, or a nano-SIM and microSD card.. The other notable feature to this phone’s design is the fingerprint sensor found below the display. The sensor is surprisingly fast and accurate for a cheap smartphone, and I had no trouble using it to secure the device. This technology has come a long way since early iterations, and it’s great to see it now being cheap enough to include in budget devices.. Interestingly, there are no physical capacitive or on-screen navigation buttons on the m3 Note, aside from the fingerprint sensor which doubles as both a home and back button. Pressing in the sensor like a button returns to the home screen, while just tapping it like a touchscreen acts as a ‘back’ command. It’s a unique way to navigate, and something I haven’t seen outside of Meizu devices. Personally I prefer standard navigation buttons, but this single-button solution is fine when you get used to it.. Meet the $170 5.5-inch Meizu m3 Note. A Budget Smartphone with Plenty to Like.
