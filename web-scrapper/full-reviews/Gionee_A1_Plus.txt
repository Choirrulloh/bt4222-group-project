This phone is fine on it's own but Amigo OS is recipe for disaster. Gionne really should upgrade to MIUI 9 or Android One, or at least they should plan a better, more stable and less memo....

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Audio, Battery & Connectivity and Verdict. With its large display and superior sound quality, the Gionee A1 Plus is a smartphone made for media consumers on-the-go and will definitely attract them. While the phone offers a great battery life, its size and weight might disappoint those who prefer carrying a handy phone.. Difficult to operate with single hand. Dual camera on smartphones is one of the most common trend we've seen in 2017. Whether its from Chinese brands like Xiaomi, OnePlus, Oppo or old guns like Apple and Samsung. However, this setup may vary in terms of rear and front camera. There is also a sufficient increase in the demand of big battery phones as mobile phones are not just used for calling these days but are full-fledged media devices. To fill in the spot with a big battery and dual camera setup, Gionee launched the A1 Plus in the market. It is the successor to the Gionee A1 which was launched early in 2017 targeting selfie obsessed consumers.. Priced at Rs 26,999, the Gionee A1 Plus is a phablet, big in size and bigger in the battery department. The smartphone has a true competitor in the form of Xiaomi Mi Max 2 , which is already owned by 3 million users. TechRadar India reviewed the Black variant of the phone and here’s what we found after two months of usage.. The Gionee A1 Plus is a big phone. Believe me when I say this, it's huge. It boasts of a 6-inch full HD display protected by 2.5D curved glass on the front with a metal back. The back has a smooth matte finish making the phone slippery in hand, so it's wise to use it with a case. The phone is quiet bulky at 226g, which. I found was difficult to use especially while calling, as I had to keep on switching it between my hands for holding it on long calls. The rounded edges give a smooth finish to the phone which also helps in gripping it tightly but one handed usage is not a thing here.. The front camera sits next to the earpiece and has a LED flash as well. The home button houses the fingerprint sensor with the navigation keys on sides of the button. The navigation keys are not backlit which makes them difficult to operate in darkness.. On the bottom lies a USB 2.0 charging port that is placed between the two grills, one is for the loudspeaker and other is for primary microphone. Surprisingly, the company hasn’t used Type-C port which is usually found in the smartphones at this price range. but it has a 3.5mm audio jack which sits at the top.. The phone has a slightly curved design with fine antenna lines at the back. It also holds the dual camera setup accompanied by the LED flash placed next to it. The company logo can be found just below the rear camera.. The 6-inch full HD display is something that catches the eyes right away as you look at it. Such gigantic IPS display offers great video watching and multimedia experience to the users. If you love watching videos on your phone then this phone is made for you. However, the thick bezels on either side of the display look a bit outdated but these can be ignored if you desire to enjoy your favorite movie holding a bright widescreen in your hand.. The screen will also add on to your gaming experience. Because of the size, it becomes easier to hold the phone and hover it easily especially if you are playing games like Asphalt 8. I personally enjoyed playing and watching videos on this phone. The colours were good and vibrant and I was able to operate the phone smoothly while staying indoors. I also decided to test the display outdoors in bright sunlight and found that it was difficult to operate the phone and the screen was hardly visible even after maxing out the brightness of the phone. I expected the screen to be brighter and readable rather than reflective but sadly, that's not how I expected.. Overall, the display of the phone is good for gaming and consuming multimedia content on it but that's majorly because of it's size.. Next Page Hardware, software and camera.

Aditya Shenoy , 14 August 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Gionee A1 Plus is powered by a MediaTek Helio P25 processor. It has a 20-megapixel selfie camera with a diffused selfie flash. The phone is bulky and tips the scale at 226 grams. Gionee A1 Plus design Gionee A1 Plus specifications Gionee A1 Plus software and performance Gionee A1 Plus camera Verdict. Gionee launched its A series in India earlier this year, and the. ( Review ) was aimed at the youth of the nation. At launch, Gionee stated that devices in this series will focus on better selfies and good battery life. We now see a new model called. Gionee had announced both the A1 and the A1 Plus at MWC in March earlier this year. While the A1 was quick to launch in India, the A1 Plus arrived only last month.. As its name suggests, the A1 Plus is bigger than the A1. It packs in a bigger battery and sports dual cameras on the back. The internals seem to have gotten a bump as well, but does that make it a winner in its price bracket? Keep reading to find out.. The first thing that struck us about the Gionee A1 Plus was its sheer size. This is a big phone and it feels bulky as well. The 6-inch display means that the A1 Plus is tough to hold in one hand at times. The fingerprint sensor is positioned on the front and is flanked by capacitive touch buttons. You can swap what the capacitive buttons do but they aren’t backlit which make them hard. This phone tips the scale at 226 grams and is heavier than the much bigger Xiaomi Mi Max 2. Its weight makes it unsuitable for long calls unless you keep alternating hands. One of the reasons behind the weight is that Gionee has gone with a 4550mAh battery. The back panel is made of metal but the end caps feel plasticky. The rear is a little slippery as well,. and given the bulk of this phone, you will need to be a little careful when handling it.. Gionee has got the power button placement spot on but the volume buttons need you to stretch your fingers a little. The dual cameras are in the centre at. the back, and there's a diffused LED flash for the front camera too. At the bottom, the Gionee A1 Plus has two grilles out of which only the right one houses a speaker. However, you still get stereo output as Gionee uses the phone's earpiece as a second speaker. There is a Micro-USB port for charging and data, which is a little surprising considering that most devices in this price range now have Type-C ports.. In the box, Gionee ships a plastic screen protector and a clear case for the phone which will save you some time in looking for accessories. You also get in-ear headphones and an 18W charger in the box, along with the SIM ejector tool.. The most striking thing about the Gionee A1 Plus is its 6-inch display, which has a full-HD resolution (1080x1920 pixels). It produces vivid output which you can tweak a little to suit your preferences. While viewing angles are the good, sunlight legibility isn’t all that great. Even with the brightness cranked all the way up, the screen was reflective. The glass does pick up a few smudges here and there but isn’t a fingerprint magnet.. To drive the A1 Plus, Gionee has opted for a MediaTek Helio P25 SoC which is an octa-core processor with four cores clocked at 1.6GHz and the other four at 2.6GHz. There is 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage which is expandable to 256GB. However, extra storage comes at the cost of a second SIM as the A1 Plus has a hybrid dual-SIM tray. The first slot can hold a Micro-SIM while the second one requires a Nano-SIM. There is support for 4G and VoLTE.. In terms of software, the Gionee A1 Plus runs Android 7.0 Nougat with the custom Amigo UI on top. This UI ditches the app drawer,. and all icons are placed on the homescreens. While notifications are available by swiping down from the top of the screen, quick toggles are moved to an iOS-like panel for which you have to swipe up from the bottom. We found that the Settings app was reorganised, so you might need to search a little for the setting you are looking for. Weirdly it also has a tab called Feature which is a guide of sorts to features on the phone. You will also find controls for various gestures that you can enable or disable if you like.. The phone also come with a couple of preinstalled apps including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Amazon, Saavn, Xender, Truecaller and the Touchpal Keyboard. We found Touchpal Keyboard to be spammy as it would load Web-based games on the phone and then have a floating widget on screen. Peel Remote, a remote app, is a surprising addition as this phone does not have an infrared emitter. Apart from the Google Play Store, Gionee has its own store called G store.which recommends apps to download. Overall, the UI is different and might take some time getting accustomed to.. We ran our usual benchmarks on the A1 Plus. It returned 65,452 in AnTuTu, plus 799 and 3737 in the single- and multi-core tests respectively in Geekbench. Performance is adequate for day-to-day usage and the 4GB of RAM helps when switching between apps. With our usage, we found that we had about 2GB of RAM free on average after a day's worth of use.. The massive 4550mAh battery powers the phone through more than a day with medium use. We found that the battery did drain a little more rapidly than we expected when gaming. In our HD video loop test the phone lasted for 14 hours and 43 minutes. Charging with the supplied 18W charger takes a little over two hours, and the phone does get hot in the process.. Following the trend of dual rear cameras, the Gionee A1 Plus gets a 13-megapixel and a 5-megapixel camera on the rear. The app has different modes to choose from including a professional mode that gives you some control over camera settings. There are multiple filters to choose from as well.. Photos from the Gionee A1 are strictly average. Colour reproduction isn’t very accurate and the phone occasionally gets metering wrong. We also found purple fringing in few photos. Objects at a distance lose quite a lot of detail as well. Photos taken in low light were dark and lacked detail. Switching the camera to night mode helps but at the cost of added noise in the output.. The secondary camera kicks in only in portrait mode where it is used to calculate depth, after which the blur effect is added artificially.. Video recording is restricted to 1080p, whereas the. similarly priced Moto Z2 Play. ( Review ) is capable of recording in 4K at 30fps.. The front camera has a 20-megapixel sensor and a diffused selfie flash. It takes good photos but they do appear flat. Surprisingly, the app does not have beautification mode, so if you were looking for it, you might be disappointed. On the other hand, you get a few filters that can be applied before taking a selfie.. Tap to see full-sized Gionee A1 Plus camera samples. The Gionee A1 Plus might not be on everyone's shopping lists because of its size. Holding it isn’t very easy and you’ll need big pockets to store it. However, it offers a big battery and decent performance for its asking price. it is quite different from the stock Android experience, so purists might not like it. Camera performance is strictly average and the secondary camera is only effective in portrait mode.. If you are specifically looking for a big-screen phone with a big battery, then the A1 Plus makes sense. However, the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 does look like a good alternative because of its significantly lower price. If more moderately sized phones will do, you could choose the Samsung Galaxy C7 Pro. ( Review ) or the Moto Z2 Play which are priced a bit lower, or get the OnePlus 3T. ( Review ) by spending a little more..

Mobiles / Gionee Mobile Phones / Gionee A1 Plus Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 2,191 Launch Date in India: 26 July, 2017 Compare. The Chinese handset maker, Gionee is famed for its slim and sleek handsets that are also powerhouse performers. So far, the brand has delivered some really good handsets in the price range of INR 15,000-20,000. However, now the handset maker is trying to step up its game and is entering the mid-range segment with its Gionee A1 Plus. This handset comes with decent specifications and powerful cameras, which would attract many buyers. Here is a brief overview of the handset for those who might be interested.. Powerful front camera : It is now a common knowledge that the front camera of the handset is no more used for their original purpose of video calling but for clicking selfies. Such is the hype of selfies that these days manufacturers are coming up with smartphones that have more powerful cameras on the front instead of back and Gionee A1 Plus is one such smartphone. There is a 16 Megapixels snapper on the front panel of the handset and the same camera on the rear panel as well.. 2.5D curved display with Corning Gorilla Glass : The front panel of this handset is dominated by a large 6-inch display, which is brilliant to look at because of the 1440 x 2560 pixels resolution. What makes the display even better is the 2.5D curved glass, which comes with Corning Gorilla Glass protection.. Impressive battery : The flagship devices are usually skimpy on battery front since they tend to be quite sleek and there is not much space for a bigger battery. However, that is not the case with Gionee A1 Plus. This handset comes with a massive 4010 mAh battery, which is sure to last a day on full charge and more if used moderately.. Bulk: This device might not suit many users since it comes with a massive display dominating the front panel.

Everyone tries to get exposure in the social networks and selfies have been the best way to stretch towards the journey. So understanding the people interests, Gionee seems quite focused on the camera side, especially the front one. Gionee S6s is one of them. Now following the league, Gionee launched its selfie-centered descendants A1 and A1 Plus in the auspicious event at MWC 2017 and they are already available in the Nepali market. The newbies have not only focused on the megapixel count of the cameras but also on the sensor size and selfie flashes to ensure enhanced photo quality and clarity.. Gionee A1 is a package of 182 grams, fitting perfectly in the dimensions of 154.5 x 76.5 x 8.5mm. It bears a 5.5 inches Full HD IPS display with 2.5D curved. The system of the device runs on Android platform with the version being Nougat (v7.0). The OS of the device is flavored by Amigo OS on the top. Powering up the device is done by MediaTek Helio P10 processor, which is an octa-core CPU that works on the clock speed of 1.8 GHz. The Graphics portion of the device is taken care by Mali T860 GPU. Memory wise, the phone carries 4GB of RAM with 64GB of internal memory. be stretched by 128 GB by the use of SDcard.. The makers have done a lot of toils. to make it the optimum alternative for the photo enthusiasts. The rear camera holds a 13MP sensor with the sensor size of 1/3.0+”. Gionee A1 rear camera also inherits a wider aperture of F/2.0 flowered by LED flash and PDAF. The LED flash will ensure clarity and photo quality even in the low light whereas PDAF helps in better focusing.. Unlike most of the smartphones, Gionee A1 has a front camera with a superior megapixel count than the rear one. The front one has a 16MP sensor with the sensor size of 3.06”. The front one too bears an aperture of F/2.0 and LED flash. For the security purpose, the phone has an embedded fingerprint scanner. The fueling of the Gionee A1 is done by 4010mAh. To shorten the time of phone with wall charger, the phone also inherits fast-charging technology. The charging on Gionee A1 will be ultrafast charging via dual charging chips. Gionee A1 is already available in Nepal for Rs. Specs wise Gionee A1 plus comes superior to A1 in many possible ways.

Gionee A1 plus is powered by MediaTek Helio P25 processor, which is an octa-core processor that works on the clock speed of 2.25 GHz. The makers hated to discriminate the siblings in the memory section as both bears 4GB of RAM and internal memory of 64GB. However, the elder one is privileged to be expanded up to 256GB.. Gionee A1 plus also runs on Android Nougat (v7.0) with Amigo OS on the top. The phablet weighs 226 grams, which seems heavy but the whopping 4550 mAh battery could be an explanation to it. The device also possesses ultrafast charging capability. Dual charging chips are provided on the device to make sure of it. On the optics side, there is a big leap from A1 to A1 Plus. The rear portion of the A1 Plus bears a dual-camera setup. The setup includes a 13MP camera with f/2.0 aperture, LED flash and PDAF accompanied by another 5MP camera.

The A1 and A1 Plus are the ambassadors for this new endeavor, which seem to represent the company's best effort to stay relevant and cater to modern demands, while still preserving its traditional strong suits.. Hence, the three main pillars for the "A" family seem to be good battery life, a quality selfie experience and general software and usability innovations.. To Gionee's credit all three points seem to shine-through clearly in the A1 and especially the A1 Plus, even on a specs-sheet only level.. The pair does seem to check quite a few boxes, meaning they could easily be a good marketing strategy away from sales success. At least on a Gionee scope, that is.. However, they aren't exactly cheap at EUR 349 for the A1 and EUR 499 for the Plus, respectively. Still, they've got some intriguing features. India and Nepal will be the first markets to judge whether the A1 and A1 Plus are worth it, starting March and April, respectively..

News Gionee A1 Plus Review: Plus on size and battery. Gionee A1 Plus Review: Plus on size and battery. The Gionee A1 Plus comes shortly after the A1, boasting of a better battery, bigger screen, a dual-camera setup at the rear and more. We’ve put the phone through the paces to find out if it can stand up against the competition.. Updated: July 27, 2017 9:38 AM IST. The Indian smartphone market is a unique one, thanks to the wide differences in approach by different brands. While one set, led from the front by Xiaomi, sticks to the online space for its ease and affordability of distribution and ability to offer better value, the other set attacks the market with flashy branding, high dealer commissions and powerful and inclusive distribution. While Oppo and Vivo continue to dominate the offline market alongside Samsung and Lenovo, there is one other player from China that is making its own in-roads into the Indian market: Gionee.. One of the earliest Chinese smartphone makers to establish a presence in India, Gionee has built a strong distribution and dealership network in North India, particularly in Rajasthan where it is one of the leading smartphone vendors by shipments. As is expected for an offline-first brand, Gionee’s products are focused on features that appeal to the masses, and often lack the geeky pizzazz that brands such as OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola and others have succeeded to build for themselves. ALSO READ: The success that Oppo and Vivo have tasted in India hints at reasons well beyond specifications. Launched in March this year, the Gionee A1 is the company’s first phone to combine the benefits of the big battery that the Marathon range is known for, along with the camera-centric features that the S range touts. Following soon after is the latest phone from Gionee, the A1 Plus at Rs 26,999. Positioned on the same lines as the A1, this new phone offers, well, a bit more on all fronts, with the dual-camera set up and bigger screen being the most noticeable. We’ve reviewed the Gionee A1 Plus, and here’s what we think about it.. Our review of the Gionee A1. speaks in detail of just what makes the phone what it is, and the A1 Plus. improves on some of these factors to earn its ‘Plus’ moniker. The biggest difference between the two phones is in its screen; the Gionee A1 Plus is significantly larger thanks to its 6-inch full-HD screen. Naturally, this makes for a more satisfying media experience, and will be particularly useful if you spend a lot of time watching videos on your phone.. The screen itself is an IPS-LCD display, and is fairly sharp, bright and detailed for a phone in this price range. You also get Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection against scratches and damage, as well as 2.5D curves at the edges for a cleaner look. Although the curves do exist and can be felt, the screen itself sits on a slab just above the main metal body of the phone, thereby negating the effects of the curvature just a bit.. The Gionee A1 Plus is also a bit heavier than its predecessor, thanks to its larger size, bigger screen and larger battery. While the A1 weighs in at a not-so-light 182g, the A1 Plus is significantly heavier at 226g and definitely feels like it. It’s also over 9mm thick, and is definitely not the phone for you if you prefer your phone compact and easy to hold, or if you have small hands. It definitely feels solid though, thanks to its metal body, although the phone is a bit top-heavy and might feel unbalanced to some.. With small improvements in the spec-sheet, the Gionee A1 Plus shows some visible improvements across the board, improving on factors that invited criticism for the Gionee A1. The biggest of these is the new SoC, with the Gionee A1 Plus sporting the MediaTek Helio P25 SoC. Clocked at up to 2.6GHz and with eight cores, the SoC offers improved performance over the Gionee A1. There’s also 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage (expandable by up to 256GB), Bluetooth 4.0 and compatibility for VoLTE and ViLTE.. The phone comes with Android Nougat 7.0 out-of-the-box, with Gionee’s Amigo 4.0 UI on top. Amigo has typically been among the less intuitive and more cluttered interfaces, and this continues with the A1 Plus. From the single-layered UI to the oddly placed settings and notification window, the interface can come across as needlessly complex. However, there are some interesting touches, including the edge bar, which brings shortcuts to a chosen set of apps and functions by swiping on the fingerprint sensor, smart gestures, and reverse charging, which lets you use the Gionee A1 Plus and its large battery to charge your other devices by functioning as a battery pack.. I did have some trouble with the phone’s fingerprint sensor though. The sensor is at the front, embedded into the physical home button, and is a bit smaller than sensors we’ve typically seen at the front of smartphones. It isn’t particularly accurate, and often needs you to place your finger firmly on the sensor in order to have it unlock the phone. I often had to try multiple times to unlock the phone, which can get particularly bothersome. While this usually works alright, these few occasions of trouble do mar the overall experience a bit.. The battery of the Gionee A1 Plus also gets a bump, with the phone powered by a 4,550mAh battery. Battery life is excellent as a result, easily lasting up to two days on a single charge with normal use. Although it doesn’t quite have the longevity and capability of the Marathon series from Gionee, it’s certainly above average when it comes to battery life and will give the Lenovo P2 a run for its money, thanks to similar optimization of the hardware and software. Considering that the phone has a large 6-inch screen to power along with the higher-end MediaTek P25 SoC, we did get a decent amount of battery life on the device. ALSO READ: Lenovo P2 Review. Also worth mentioning is that the Gionee A1 Plus comes with fast charging capability, with an 18W charger bundled in the box. Capable of charging at either 18W or 10W, the charger initially fast charges the phone when the battery level is low, eventually reducing the voltage as the battery nears full. With large battery phones, fast charging has become a necessity to avoid spending too much time keeping the phone plugged in, and the Gionee is able to charge up in about 90-100 minutes from near zero to full. You can also use the phone to reverse charge other devices with a USB-OTG cable, making use of the big battery.. One of the big new features of the Gionee A1 Plus is its set of cameras. With a dual-camera set up at the rear and 20-megapixel front camera with lamp flash, the phone is certainly geared towards improving your photography. The rear camera setup uses a primary 13-megapixel sensor and a secondary 5-megapixel sensor which is used to create a bokeh effect for portrait mode shots. Video can be recorded at up to 1080p with the rear camera and 720p with the front camera, which highlights the shortcomings of the MediaTek P25 SoC under the hood.. In good light, pictures are decent enough, with minimal grain, decent detail and good color reproduction, although you are likely to see better results from similarly priced phones such as the Nubia Z17 Mini , or even the lower priced Moto G5 Plus. Switching to the portrait mode, the depth-sensing ability of the camera is decent enough, and manages to take decent bokeh shots. However, here again the Nubia Z17 Mini offers more in the way of features to use the two cameras effectively, such as clone mode and true monochrome for better low-light photography.. Low-light photography isn’t quite as good as it could be, and in general, the camera of the Gionee A1 Plus comes across as decent, but not quite the best. The 20-megapixel front camera is above average when it comes to shooting selfies, so if you enjoy taking pictures of yourself, the phone will be good for you. Pictures are well composed, bright, detailed and colorful. The presence of lamp flash at the front is a useful addition as well, and will help with pictures taken in low-light.. Check out some camera samples that we shot using the Gionee A1 Plus below.. The Gionee A1 Plus is a capable successor to the Gionee A1 in many ways, particularly thanks to its bigger battery, larger screen and excellent front camera. While the rear camera falls a bit short on expectations and performance is average at best, there’s enough in the smartphone to make it a worthwhile purchase if you’re looking for a big-screen phone with a big battery. Although some competing options could be better, it’s important to remember that the Gionee A1 Plus is available to buy offline, which is a key purchase factor for a lot of buyers.. At its price of Rs 26,999, the Gionee may appeal to a lot of buyers with its big specifications, massive battery, large screen and boast-worthy camera set. However, it’s also quite expensive as compared to other big-screen, big-battery devices such as the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 .. Although offline availability and ease of purchase will of course negate the price difference to some extent, the phone is still a bit expensive for what you’re getting.. You do get a basic, functioning bokeh mode, as well as an excellent front camera with flash for good selfies. While the phone isn’t perfect in all ways, it’s certainly a capable device in a lot of departments, and is worth checking out if you’re looking for a new phone with a big battery and big screen at under 30,000 that you can buy in a retail store near you..

The Gionee A1 Plus launched at the MWC 2017 alongside its younger sibling Gionee A1 competes directly with Lenovo Z2 Plus and a few other popular smartphones. Unlike the other Chinese smartphones that come with a fingerprint scanner on the rear-side of the device, the Gionee A1 Plus has it on the front of the device. The all-metal body design gives the device a premium look and feel. However, some bits like the camera hump on the back and no branding on the front of the device reminds that the device is from a Chinese manufacturer.. The 5.7-inch display with 2.5D glass not only helps in a better overall appearance of the device but also help in better multimedia and productivity capabilities. The 6.0-inch display is an IPS LCD unit as usual with Full HD resolution. We hope that the Gionee will soon launch devices with AMOLED technology as it is better than LCD at the same cost. The Android 7.0 Nougat powered Gionee A1 Plus has a plenty of add-on features up its sleeve, among which a few are essential, and the others are just for show. The software, however, has some bloatware filled in it as always and takes up some of the internal memory of the device. Gionee is not known to be providing software updates for new versions of Android. Nonetheless, we expect the manufacturer to provide Android security updates.. Smartphones from Gionee are not popular for their camera performance. However, the all-new Gionee A1 Plus is set to change it, at least in the secondary camera department. The device has a 20-megapixel secondary camera and a dual (13-megapixel + 5-megapixel) primary camera with LED flash, while the latter has a phase detection autofocus.

Gionee A1 Plus Review: Is it the best mid-range Multimedia smartphone?. Gionee A1 Plus sports a capable dual-camera setup, a 20MP selfie camera, massive 6-inch Full HD screen and a big 4,450 mAh battery unit. Updated: Monday, August 7, 2017, 10:34 [IST]. What was once said for the 4-inch screen devices is now gradually becoming the fate of mobile phones sporting 5-inch displays. The latter are now being overshadowed by even bigger screen handsets which are considered as the ideal gadgets to consume multimedia content.. Crisp 6-inch full HD screen | Stereo speakers are a welcome addition | Battery lasts long | Good selfie camera and satisfactory dual-lens rear camera. Big bulky design | cluttered UI. While we have number of handsets sporting screen sizes in the respectable range of 5.2-inches to 5.7-inches, the focus is now shifting to bigger 6-inch screen handsets. These big-screen mobile devices, or as we call them-phablets are no less than pocket sized TVs that when combined with the affordable 4G internet plans; serve as the ultimate multimedia devices to millennials.. One such handset is Xiaomi Mi Max 2, the big brother of all big screen devices. The phablet sports a humongous 6.44-unch full HD screen and is backed by a powerful 5,300 mAh battery unit. However, the other features of the phablet, i.e. camera and processing power are pretty standard and might not please hardcore smartphone enthusiasts.. This is where Gionee A1 Plus comes in. The phablet not just offers a large screen and big battery unit; it also boasts a capable 20MP selfie camera and a dual-lens rear camera setup to make things interesting in the mid-range price-point. We put the phablet to our standard review process to find out how it performs in everyday life. Here's what we have to say about the big screen Gionee A1 Plus.. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!. Display: 6-inch Full HD screen is bright and vivid Bigger and Bulkier Gionee A1 Buttons are placed ergonomically Camera: Crisp selfies and capable dual-lens rear camera Software: Android 7.0 Nougat with Gionee’s Amigo 4.0 Hardware: Quick and Responsive in everyday use Battery and Connectivity: Can last for up to two days Conclusion. Gionee A1 Plus can be the ideal handset for users who spend most of their time in watching videos, reading news/books on their phones or playing games, which is exactly what I did with my review unit. The 6-inch full HD screen on Gionee A1 might not be as big as the 6.44-inch display you get with Xiaomi Mi Max 2, but it is still a better one. I say this because unlike the screen on Mi Max 2, the display on A1 Plus is much less reflective. It delivers a good overall viewing experience where you don't need to adjust the phone's position to attain the best view. The 2.5D curved glass protecting the screen very well manages the light and results in better video playback and gaming experience.. And the icing on the cake here is the integration of dual stereo speakers. You can play games and watch a whole season of your favorite series even if you are not carrying a pair of earphones. The audio produced by these speakers (placed at the bottom) is loud and clear. However, some amount of distortion is noticeable at maximum volume.. The display offers a resolution of 1080x1920 pixels resulting in a pixel count of and 367 ppi. Unlike the AMOLED screen on the previous Gionee A1, the A1 Plus uses an IPS LCD panel and offers a balanced colour reproduction. The display settings allow you to tweak the colour balance as per your requirement. A built-in smart eye protection mode is also provided to deliver a comfortable reading and viewing experience while you use the handset in low-light.. Overall, the display on Gionee A1 Plus will certainly please multimedia lovers. One thing that seems missing here is some sort of display protection as the company hasn't mentioned anything about it.. The big screen Gionee A1 Plus is best suited for two-handed usage because of its big and bulky design. However if you have bigger hands, you can still manage to navigate throughout the home screens, dial a number, scroll your Facebook and Instagram timeline with some little thumb exercise. The rounded corners and gentle curves give the handset some degree of ergonomics. The weight is also quite understandable as there's a big 4,500 mAh battery unit powering the device.. As far as look and feel is concerned, Gionee A1 Plus looks like a bigger A1. It is made out of metal and feels sturdy in hands. The smartphone also looks quite premium, especially when seen from the rear panel where you will find the dual-lens camera setup, dual LED flash and Gionee's trademark branding which can be easily mistaken for a circular fingerprint scanner.. The right side of the handset has volume rockers and power button that offers good feedback, while the hybrid SIM card tray is placed on the left edge. You can click the power button thrice to trigger the panic button that automatically connects the call to the emergency number, a handy feature in emergency situations. The clickable home button on the front has the fingerprint sensor embedded in it that unlocks the handset in a jiffy. The 3.5mm headphone jack is placed on top.. Overall, the big phablet brings a robust built and also looks premium.. Gionee A1 Plus was originally showcased in Mobile World congress (MWC 2017) along with the Gionee A1. The smaller A1 features a capable 16MP front camera and now sells at Rs. I have reviewed the previous Gionee A1 and its 16MP selfie camera capture good selfies. The selfie camera on the bigger Gionee A1 Plus is even better and delivers amazing results. The phablet features a 20MP front camera that clicks crisp and vibrant selfies. The results are better when compared to the previous Gionee A1 but not as good as the Honor 8 Pro that is priced at Rs. The front camera is also supported by a LED flashlight to brighten up the images in non-ideal light conditions. You also get Face beauty mode to tweak the selfies you capture.. But the significant upgrade here is the dual-lens rear camera setup. The company has stepped up the game by introducing a 13MP+5MP rear camera that is capable to deliver a good depth of field effect. The depth-sensing ability of the dual-lens camera setup is good and makes for a natural blur effect, but once again the overall output does not match up with the results delivered by the Honor 8 Pro.. Talking about the other aspects of the camera, the images you capture in daylight display accurate colours with ample detailing. The camera however struggles in low-light conditions.. Overall, Gionee A1 Plus brings much improved camera hardware when compared to its predecessor but loses the fight when you pit it against the Honor 8 Pro. The price difference between the two handsets is of Rs. Running on the latest Android 7.0 Nougat, the smartphone does not disappoint in everyday software performance. You get the company's customized skin- Amigo OS 4.0 that also powered the previous Gionee A1. user interface is quite cluttered but at the same time, it is also one of the most customizable software layers in the market. A dedicated online marketplace is provided which allows you to download themes, wallpapers and widgets to customize the look and feel of your handset.. The settings menu also allows you to set smart gestures and manage touch capacitive buttons functionality to operate the handset with an ease in everyday usage. Besides, there are several nifty smart settings such as glove mode, edge bar that brings a window of predefined controls on the edges of the screen and skylight mode to make it easy to use the touch screen in case you have applied a flip cover on your smartphone.. The only weak point here seems to be the oddly placed settings shortcuts. A first time Gionee user can get really confused between the notification panel and control center that are triggered by a swipe down and a swipe up respectively.. The design team should merge them in one to offer a seamless Android user experience. In the current scenario, it seems Gionee Amigo is trying too much to mimic the Apple's iOS and that can be a deal breaker for users who prefer pure and seamless Google experience.. Gionee is still sticking up with the MediaTek chipset that on papers may disappoint some Snapdragon fans but in everyday life, the performance is lag free. Gionee A1 Plus is backed by a Helio P25 octa-core chip that comprises of 4 Cortex A-53 cores clocked at 2.5GHz and the other four clocked at 1.4GHz. The processor is capable to offer a seamless everyday performance where you can execute all the important tasks without any major issues. The smartphone is pretty responsive and apps fire up instantly. Photo editing, camera usage, video playback and browsing experience was devoid of any lags and even the handset handled heavy multitasking with an ease.. The 4GB RAM makes sure the handset runs multiple applications simultaneously without breaking a sweat. The gameplay on the phablet is also quite immersive, thanks to the big 6-inch full HD screen. I mostly played Marvel Champions on the phablet and didn't come across any frame drops.. Storage will not be an issue for users as Gionee A1 comes with 64GB of internal storage that can be expanded by up to 256GB via microSD card.. Gionee A1 Plus's big 6-inch screen is complemented by a large battery unit. The phablet draws power from a big 4,550 mAh battery unit that managed to last for two days on a single charge with a mixed usage pattern. The battery backup is slightly less than the Mi Max 2 but you can still watch movies, play games and do the other standard tasks without worrying much about the battery life.. The smartphone also supports fast charging and comes with a number of battery optimization modes to reduce the power consumption. You get an 18W charger in the package that can recharge the battery to 100 percent in about 90 minutes. The big battery of Gionee A1 Plus can be also be used to reverse charge other devices as the handset also supports USB-OTG.. As far as connectivity goes, Gionee A1 has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, dual-SIM support, 4G LTE and VoLTE and GPS.. Gionee A1 Plus is a significant upgrade over the previous Gionee A1. The company has fitted a big Full HD screen to please users who love to play games and stream videos on their mobile devices. The camera performance is also significantly improved and the phablet can also last long with the help of its big battery unit.. The bigger A1 Plus also brings some notable upgrades in the camera department. The 20MP selfie camera and the dual-lens rear camera setup will please camera enthusiasts but it's not as good as the camera hardware you get with the Honor 8 Pro that is slightly expensive than the Gionee A1 Plus.. However, what works in the favor of Gionee is the fact that there is still a large base of Indian consumers who is still skeptical about online shopping. For them, Gionee has engineered a big screen multimedia phablet that lasts long, looks premium and delivers capable camera hardware. If you do not belong to the above mentioned user base, you can consider other worthy options selling on e-commerce portals in the Indian market.. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!.

The Gionee A1 Plus is a big phone with an even bigger battery and a dual camera setup at the back, but is it worth your hard earned money?. Gionee A1 Plus Features & Specifications. Gionee A1 Plus Design & Build. The Gionee A1 Plus display is glossy with a less than adequate maximum brightness level. The Gionee A1 Plus features a 6-inch Full HD IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1080×1920 pixels and a pixel density of 367 pixels per inch. The phone comes with a 2.5D curved glass with Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The screen is okay and is similar to the Oppo F3 & Moto Z2 Play in this price bracket.. The display of the Gionee A1 Plus gives a mixed viewing experience with good colour reproduction. The brightness of the display is extremely low and you will find yourself adjusting it a lot but still desiring for more, and due to this being the case using the phone in low light environment is extremely easy on the eyes. Using the phone outside, you might sometimes feel that the screen is a bit washed out in terms of colours. The device in the display setting does offer a setting to change the colour temperature of the display to be warm or cold based on your personal preferences.. Also to note, the glossy screen makes it difficult to view content under bright light as it reflects everything. Overall, we can say that Gionee could have made some little tweaks to the display to be much better, or they could have altogether provided a better screen as at this price point phones like the Nexus 6P or the Moto Z2 Play..

The dual-rear camera is here to stay, and we have seen various companies implement it in different ways. Apple , OnePlus , Oppo and vivo. — with dual front selfie cameras — and Huawei ’s Honor brand are some of the players with dual cameras in the market. Now Gionee has launched its new A1 Plus smartphone in India with a dual rear camera and a 20MP front camera with flash.. Priced at Rs 26,990, this phone is competing with some of the mid-range options in the market like Honor 8 Pro, which again has an excellent dual rear camera. Then, of course, there’s the OnePlus 5, which has a more powerful Snapdragon 835 processor. So how does the Gionee A1 Plus fare in our review? Here’s what we thought of the device.. Gionee A1 Plus Specifications: 6-inch Full HD (1920x 1080 pixels) IPS display | Helio P25 (octa-core upto 2.6Hz) | 4GB RAM + 64GB storage, (up to 256GB microSD support) | 13MP AF f/2.0 + 5MP fixed focus with f/2.2 rear camera + 20MP front camera with FF, f/2.0 | Android Nougat v7.0 with amigo 4 |Dimensions 166.4 x 83.3 x 9.1 mm, weight 226 gm | 4550mAh, Li – Polymer battery |. Gionee A1 Plus price in India Rs 26,990. Gionee A1 Plus Display, Design review. Gionee A1 Plus has a 6-inch full HD resolution display, and at 226 grams this is heavier and bigger than your average smartphone. We got the matte black version, which looks nice, but matte black is like the rose gold for 2017. Still there’s no denying that this is one bulky smartphone. The fingerprint scanner is embedded in the front button on this smartphone.. The Gionee A1 Plus comes with a slightly curved back, and a vertically stacked dual rear camera set up. Just below that is the Gionee Logo. The phone’s rear body has two prominent antenna band lines on the top and bottom, there’s a headphone jack on the top. Dual bottom firing speakers are also present on the device, and in the middle of these there’s a micro-USB charging slot. Gionee has not gone for a Type-C cable, but fast charging is included in the device.. From a design perspective, I would say Gionee A1 Plus has a disadvantage given the size and weight. With the competition offering thinner, lighter phones in a similar price range, Gionee A1 Plus might end up alienating those looking for a phone that can fit in their pocket easily.. On the display front, the 6-inch full HD resolution is not bad at all, and at par with what rivals are offering. From a video consumption perspective, the phone’s big screen means a lot more viewing space, though the thicker bezels do seem outdated. Nonetheless, this is a bright and vibrant display and should appeal to most users.. Gionee A1 Plus comes with the MediaTek Helio P25. There’s 4GB RAM on board and 64GB storage, which should be enough for most users. However, there’s some serious bloatware on this phone; more on that later. The Gionee A1 Plus is more than capable of handling basic performance, which includes browsing the web and social media apps, without any issues.. Games like Lara Croft Run work smoothly on this phone, but with Asphalt 8 there’s a noticeable lag in some instances. While gaming, the phone tends to get warm, although it is nothing unbearable. I wouldn’t say this is the fastest smartphone in this price range. It scores around 64,000 for us in Antutu, which isn’t really that impressive. On GeekBench the single-core score was 798, and the multi-core score was 3643. Benchmarks aside, this phone’s performance isn’t as a flawless as it should be for this price range. Additionally, the fingerprint scanner in this phone is not always accurate. There were times when it would say incorrect fingerprint and I’d have to type in the PIN.. The dual-rear camera is a bit of a hit and miss on this smartphone. The portrait mode, which blurs out the background to keep in the object in sharp focus, does give good results in some cases, though the blurring effect can often extend on to the actual person. I tried a couple of these with my dog, and while the lighting and the object in question were far from ideal, the results were pretty good.. However, with indoor lighting the portrait mode does struggle, and in some photos you can see the person’s hand has got blurred. Also, the portrait mode does have a processing time after you click the picture, so be a bit patient.. The regular camera though is impressive, and you can get some detailed photos. Colours like greens, red appear a bit over-saturated. The camera managed to capture some nice shots, though it’s not the best for low light. The selfie camera has some good results, though it takes a little bit of effort. However, I don’t really care for the selfie-flash so much, though it can make your pictures look brighter in low-light. Overall, I’d say the dual-rear camera is fun, but it’s not yet perfect.. Gionee A1 Plus Software UI review. Gionee A1 Plus comes with Amigo 4 OS from the company, with Android Nougat 7.0. It’s good to see the latest version of Android running on this phone. However, Amigo OS is a mess and confusing. The settings are placed at the bottom menu, kind of like iOS style, and on Android phone it is confusing to swipe up for these. As I’ve said the phone comes with a lot of bloatware, including pre-loaded games, etc all of which is unnecessary even with 64GB storage.. Gionee A1 Plus also has a feature where it would automatically limit the amount of data that could be used via hotspot, and it took me some time to figure out how to increase this limit from 10MB to a lot more. For users, a simple, clean UI works better than something so confusing.. comes with a 4550mAh battery, and it has fast charge feature as well. The fast charge is useful and you can expect a full battery in over two hours, which is impressive. On the PC Mark battery test, it scored around 10 hours 10 minutes, which is good, but this phone sports a big battery as well. On average, expect this phone to last all day easily, even if you’re doing a lot of browsing on the web, watching videos or listening to music like I did with this phone.. The Gionee A1 Plus combines some interesting features like a dual-rear camera, a big 6-inch display and ample battery life. However, the phone’s performance is far from perfect, and certainly not as powerful as some of the other rivals in the price range. Buy the Gionee A1 Plus if you want a good selfie camera and dual rear camera, but can’t afford to pay extra for OnePlus 5. For those who want more powerful options, the market has a range of offerings to consider from, including Moto Z2 Play, Oppo F3 Plus, and even the older OnePlus 3T ..
