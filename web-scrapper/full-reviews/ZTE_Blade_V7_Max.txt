Average Score: 78% - good Average of. 78% Finally, ZTE made a decent mid-range premium phone Source: KL Gadget Guy ZTE has definitely stepped up its game in making decent smartphones, the Blade V7 series have made it to my recommendation list for mid-range smartphones, in this case, the V7 Max is one of the best mid-rangers I've seen this year as it offers a solid build with great performance internals, retailing at RM999, it is a beautiful yet hilarious price tag to make it to the below RM1000 smartphone list, probably the only thing that ZTE really needs to fix is the ugly software experience, if not, just leave it stock and I would be extremely happy to recommend this phone to anyone out there.

This display is quite big for a smartphone but frequently used for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. ZTE is short for Zhong Xing Telecommunication Equipment Company Limited, which was founded in China in 1985. The product range includes, for example, USB sticks, routers, smartphones and tablets.. The ratings of the relatively many reviews have a wide range from below-average to very good (as of 2016).. ZTE Axon 7 Mini Adreno 405. Similar devices from a different Manufacturer.

A-GPS, GPS, FM Radio, Bluetooth 4.0, fingerprint sensor, USB OTG, DTS sound system, USB Type-C. A few months ago I did a review on the new ZTE Blade V7 Lite , which I think is a cheap smartphone that is good for daily use. In fact, I still have the V7 Lite with me which I now use as my secondary phone. It’s small and slim, hardly know that it’s there in my pocket when I go out. Now, the bigger brother to the V7 Lite is now in my hands for a review.. Introducing the ZTE Blade V7 Max .. I have been using the Blade V7 Max for about a week. And within that one week, I find that the Blade V7 Max is a breeze to use. The sharp 5.5″ FHD IPS screen is a beauty to look at. And the look of the phone is no doubt a head turner. I have people giving me a double take just to see what phone I was holding. Yes, it does have a similar look to the latest iPhone. Having said that, the V7 Max is something that anyone would like to have if they’re looking for something fancy that won’t maxed up their spending.. Before I begin my full review, here are the specifications.. When I first held the V7 Max in my hand, I was in awe. At one glance, it does look like the new iPhone. It looks and feels like a flagship. At only 7.2mm thickness with rounded edges, the V7 Max feels good in my hand. But to some people, it may not be that grippy.. Inside the box, you’ll get the usual stuffs. The Blade V7 Max unit, charger, manuals, a pin to open the SIM slot, earphone, and the USB Type-C interface.. Looking at the overall design of the Blade V7 Max feels like a premium phone. The all metal body feels solid without any squeaking lose parts, which is now a norm for an all metal phone.. The fingerprint sensor is located on the right side of the phone, just under the power button. It may look thin and small but the sensor can read your fingerprint really quick. On paper, it says that it will take about 0.4 seconds to read your fingerprint and unlock the phone. As soon as I placed my finger there, the phone unlocks almost immediately. On rare occasions, it will misread my fingerprint. Maybe because I pressed my finger on the sensor too hard. You just need to touch it lightly, no need to press like it’s a button.. Do you know that you can use the fingerprint sensor for many other functions? Those who love taking selfies, you just need to touch the sensor to snap a picture. You can also use it as a scroller when you’re reading a web page. Swipe downwards to scroll down and swipe up to scroll up. You can also touch it to answer a call and to unlock any encrypted files stored in the phone.. On the left side of the phone is the SIM slot and the volume up-down button. At the top, you’ll see the hole for the standard 3.5mm headphone jack (so you don’t need to drill a hole), while at the bottom are the Type-C USB interface, microphone and speaker holes. At the front bottom side is the capacitive touch home button and configurable back/menu buttons on either sides which will lid up during. The back of the phone looks simple and clean. Rear camera is located at the top left side of the back and the obvious dual tone LED flash below it with ZTE logo smack right in the center. Also a fine print that reads, “Designed by ZTE in Munich, Assembled in China”. The back is really smooth, sometimes can be too slippery. So be careful where you place your V7 Max in future.. Now lets dig in deeper into the internal parts.. The Blade V7 Max comes pre-installed with Android 6.0 Marshmallow right out-of-the-box. The year old OS performs well on the V7 Max with overall usage is above average most of the time. Above average here means that it does not lag nor hang from time to time. Scrolling through pages or screen is buttery smooth. Opening an app took just a few seconds and running multiple apps in the background seems like an easy job for the V7 Max without utilising much of the RAM.. A little intro about the CPU used in the V7 Max. It has a total of eight cores clocking at 1.8GHz. The Helios P10 is said to perform well during. hard usages such as playing games or video processing. Comes with fast LTE network technology and improved HiFi sound system, hence why the V7 Max has the DTS audio feature. Coupled that with 3GB of RAM, you got one gentle beast right here.. With that kind of hardware, I did a little benchmark test with Antutu.. A total score of 47800 is not bad, but can be better. Like I said, the Blade V7 Max is a gentle beast. The score placed the V7 Max in between Meizu’s MX5 and M3 Note. Playing games like Temple Run on the V7 Max is smooth, no lags or whatsoever. So don’t let the score fooled you.. that you will get with your Blade V7 Max. The whole system is easy to use and navigate. This phone is hassle free, anyone and everyone can use it. Only difference between this interface and the standard Vanilla Android is that it doesn’t come with an app drawer. So every apps you install will be in the main screen.. I am happy with the overall performance of the Blade V7 Max. The phone itself is slim and fits nicely in my jeans pocket. Very responsive on touch, therefore typing on the on-screen keyboard is a breeze. And the camera, well…that’s another story. Yes I know, majority of consumers today are looking at camera and photo qualities when deciding to buy a phone. So, let’s find out how the camera performs now…shall we?.

BladeV7 Max helios p10 MediaTek review ZTE. ZTE Launched Official Online Store in 11Street. DJI Introduces Mavic Air For Limitless Exploration. Hotel Guests Get a Kick Out of Nissan’s Self-Parking Slippers. Thanks for reviewing the phone, it really helped me decide on this phone.
