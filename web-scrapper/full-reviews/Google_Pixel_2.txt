Google Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL: News, tips, problems, specs and more!. Everything you need to know about the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL!. Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL review!. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are finally here, and there's a lot to unpack.. While these devices resemble the original Pixel and Pixel XL, there are many changes both internally and externally that make them worth talking about.. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are incredible phones — probably the best Android phones out there right now. Despite their different sizes, they are nearly identical where it counts, in their cameras, their performance, their build quality, and their software experience. While the Pixel 2 XL has slimmer bezels and a slightly more washed-out pOLED display, the smaller Pixel 2 contends with a more dated-looking form factor and a smaller battery. Oh, and a smaller price tag to boot.. Which one should you buy? Read the full review below!. Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL review: The new standard for Android. Pixel 2 second opinion: Close to perfect. Google Pixel 2 review, one month later: Still solid, still the best. Before we dive into the phones themselves, it's worth pointing out that the Pixel 2 XL has a few display issues. The quality of the panel itself is fairly low compared to equivalent Samsung models , featuring discoloration when viewed off-center; graininess and muddiness, especially at low brightness; poor backlight uniformity (similar to the LG V30 ); and in some cases, burn-in .. — Alex Dobie (@alexdobie) October 22, 2017. That's some pretty wild OLED burn-in on the Pixel 2 XL after maybe 7 days of full-time use pic.twitter.com/EPJTs6D0Kg. Burn-in consists of a permanent marking on the screen after an unmoving image has been there for some time. It's a hallmark of OLED displays, and can be found on panels of both high and low quality. Generally, the higher the quality the longer burn-in takes to show.. In a post on its community forums, Google addressed the issue, saying that it found the burn-in, or "differential aging," characteristics of the OLED panel on the Pixel 2 XL to be no worse than other flagships using screens of the same technology.. Extensive testing of the Pixel 2 XL display show that its decay characteristics are comparable to OLED panels used in other premium smartphones. The differential aging should not affect the user experience of the phone, as it's not visible under normal use of your Pixel 2 XL.. Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL specs. An update issued in early November added a "Saturated" mode to the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL's screens, and dramatically improved the color quality of the 2 XL. While blue shift is still a problem, washed-out colors are not, and Google now fades the navigation bar after a few seconds to mitigate burn-in. The official Android 8.1 update improved the Pixel 2 XL's colors even more, so we'd now venture to say most people won't notice an issue with the phone's screen.. More: Google Pixel 2 XL adds new display profiles, UI changes to address burn-in. How do they compare to other phones?. These are two phones of different screen sizes, screen-to-body ratios and aspect ratios, but otherwise nearly identical internal components.. Without knowing beforehand, you wouldn't be able to tell that the Pixel 2 was made by HTC and the Pixel 2 XL by LG — they're that similar. But when you dig a little deeper, the lineages are clear: the Pixel 2's AMOLED display (which is actually made by Samsung) is clearly better than the washed-out, problematic LG-made pOLED display on the Pixel 2 XL.. Both phones have Snapdragon 835s, 4GB of RAM and between 64GB and 128GB storage standard, along with single rear 12MP cameras — this year with OIS. They're waterproof (yay!) but don't have headphone jacks (boo!). There'so no wireless charging, but the sides can be squeezed to activate Google Assistant. And though it ships with Android 8.0, not 8.1, there's a lot new here — including an embedded eSIM to connect to Project Fi even without a SIM card.. Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL specs. Of course, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL don't exist in a vacuum; they are in an industry overwhelmed by choice. It's pretty hard to buy a bad phone at this point in time, so how do the Pixel 2s stand out? We investigate in a number of comparisons with the top-of-the-line phones on the market right now.. Samsung Galaxy S8: Let's argue about bezels. Samsung Galaxy Note 8: Big phones, big prices. LG V30: The perfect pair for right now. iPhone 8: Do these bezels make my phone look fat?.

This year, the proposition seems a bit simpler because Google made it an easier choice: 64GB or 128GB.. Google Pixel 2: Which storage size should you buy?. The Pixels, when they launched in October 2016, were no slouches. Featuring specs that still hold up today, including some of the best cameras on the market, it's interesting to see how far Google came with the Pixel 2 series — especially on the larger Pixel 2 XL.. Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL vs. Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Specs comparison. So the question is — should you upgrade from last year's models? That's a difficult question to answer, but it's one a lot of people will be considering.. Google is doubling down on the single camera. Then there are the 2015 models, the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. Those are a bit older, and definitely don't have the same quality of experience.

Google built its own custom imaging chip to make the Pixel 2's camera even better. Something amazing happened this year: Google didn't add a second camera to either the Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL.

Starting with the Android 8.1 update, it gives third-party developers a direct line to the immense amount of data captured by the Pixel 2's camera sensor.. At first, the Visual Core will allow developers to tap into Google's incredible HDR+ mode, which improves low-light performance while preserving detail in difficult lighting conditions. Then who knows — this is Google's first foray into custom silicon, and it has huge potential for the future of the Pixel lineup..

Of course, the Pixel still supports that physical piece of plastic and bits, but you don't need it to connect to Project Fi, and that little detail heralds the future of mobile connectivity — whenever the carriers decide to catch up. In the meantime, if you're in the U.S., you can buy a Pixel 2 and activate Project Fi whenever you want, even if you didn't order it directly them from.. Google Pixel 2 doesn't need a SIM card, as long as you use Project Fi. The Pixel 2 series will get Android R 😱. Here's what you should do first.

The Bad The phone's battery doesn't keep pace with the Pixel's competitors and its Portrait Mode isn't as smooth on dual-camera phones. Its design feels dated and it doesn't have wireless charging or a headphone jack.. The Bottom Line Buy the Pixel 2 for the best camera on any Android phone and fast Google updates, but skip it if you can't live without a headphone jack or a standout design.. Pixel 2 pricing and sale date. Google Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL pricing. Pixel 2 XL: What's the difference?. Squeezable sides and water resistance, but no headphone jack. New lock and home screen features. Editors' Note : This article was originally published Oct. 23 detailing the Pixel 2 XL's screen burn-in issue, on Oct. 25 with further observations and Google's initial remarks, and on Oct. a software fix and extended two-year warranty .. Last year's inaugural Pixel was such a slam dunk, I expected this year's Google Pixel 2 -- and larger Pixel 2 XL -- to carry Google's phone even further.. In the most important ways, it has. The Pixel 2 has the best camera quality of any Android phone, and updates like water resistance and a best-in-class processor make it a top pick. The Android Oreo software will get regular updates, and Google's Lens feature taps into Google's vast search database so you can immediately learn more about the world around you.. Pixel 2 and 2 XL photos: Feast your eyes. In other ways, the Pixel 2 bucks big trends, foregoing the dual cameras seen in most of its competitors. Bokeh-effect pictures don't look quite as elegant as those on the Apple iPhone 8 Plus ( $526.40 at Amazon.com ) and the Pixel 2's battery is so-so compared to its top-tier rivals. The Pixel also doesn't flaunt super-thin bezels, so it looks less sexy than the Samsung Galaxy S8 ( $597.42 at Amazon.com ) and Note 8. And lastly, I really do miss that headphone jack.. But the Pixel 2 is a fantastic phone for Android purists and casual fans alike. Putting aside Portrait Mode, it still has an impressive camera that can handle all sorts of tricky environments like low light, shadows and brightly lit backgrounds. In the end, the Pixel 2 mostly holds its own against the iPhone 8 Plus and Galaxy Note 8 ( $900.00 at Amazon.com ) , with a few omissions (like Portrait Mode and battery life, respectively). And while the Pixel 2 isn't exciting or particularly beautiful, its whole outweighs the sum of its parts.. If you prefer a bigger display and have the budget, however, you may be interested in the 6-inch Pixel 2 XL. But be aware that there have been reported issues with its display in early review models, which I detail later.. See a full specs comparison at the end of this review.. The phone is available through Verizon, the Google Store, Project Fi and Best Buy. The Pixel 2 comes in three colors: Kinda Blue, Just Black and Clearly White, and costs $649 (64GB) and $749 (128GB).. The differences between the two phones come down to price (obviously), size, bezel width and screen technology. The Pixel 2 XL has a bigger 6-inch display and a higher resolution than the 5-inch Pixel 2. It also uses a plastic-OLED (POLED) display, while the Pixel 2 has a more traditional AMOLED screen. Other than this, the phones are the same including their hardware and software features.. The 6-inch Pixel 2 XL (left) and the 5-inch Pixel 2 (right).. There have been reported issues about the display on the Pixel 2 XL though. screen burn-in , wherein remnants of images remain on the screen despite not being actively displayed. Screen burn-in does happen on different types of displays, but usually after some time. The fact that it's happening on such a premium and expensive phone so soon is a red flag. Google issued a statement saying that the Pixel 2 XL's burn-in issue was "in line with that of other premium smartphones and should not affect the normal, day-to-day user experience" (despite the fact that we didn't see evidence of burn-in on the Pixel 2, LG V30 or Galaxy S8). The company promises ongoing software updates starting in the next few weeks that will optimize the phone against burn-in and extended both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL's warranty to two years .. Right now, we don't know how serious or how widespread the burn-in issue is (are these anecdotal issues with an early batch of screens, or are they symptomatic of an endemic problem with the product?), or how well Google's upcoming software updates will help ameliorate the problem. In the meantime, we're keeping an eye on our other Pixel 2 XLs to see how they fare over time with normal use.. Another, more minor issue is that the Pixel 2 XL's display. looks more muted and washed-out compared to others like the Galaxy S8 and. LG V30 ( $749.99 at Best Buy ) , the latter of which has the same POLED screen with the same resolution. There's also a bluish hue that's visible when tilting the phone at different angles (this is known as blue shift). that based on user feedback about this issue, it will add a new mode for saturated colors through a software update in the coming weeks. While the Pixel 2 XL's screen isn't indeed as vibrant as its competitors, I don't view the first problem as a deal breaker. As for the blue shift, this is a hardware issue you'll find on most phones if you tilt the screen far enough. How wide you want this tilting window to be depends on your tolerance.. Just Black, Cleary White, Kinda Blue. Compared to the super-slim bezels of the Galaxy Note 8, LG V30 and iPhone X ( $1,099.99 at Best Buy ) , the Pixel 2 looks thick and frankly, a little boring. The design does allow for front-facing speakers, which create an even, robust sound, and the glass shade on the back looks tidier and cleaner. Still, the Pixel 2's thicker bezels make it look dated compared to other top phones.. In the box, you'll get a USB-C to headphone jack dongle.. There's also the disappointing matter of the headset jack, which goes the way of the iPhone and Motorola Moto phones. Even if the design change made the Pixel 2 thinner and leaves space for a bigger battery, the omission is kind of a drag for people who have a pair of great wired headphones or earbuds they'd rather keep using without an adaptor dongle (which comes included in the box).. But it's not all bad -- the Pixel 2 is water-resistant. I submerged both the Pixel 2 and 2 XL twice in a bucket filled with a foot of water (that's well under their IP67 standard rating, which dictates a maximum depth of 1 meter, or about 3 feet) for a little over 28 minutes. They both worked fine immediately after each dunk.. Lastly, Google borrowed the HTC U11 's pressure-sensitive sides. Squeeze the phone to open Google Assistant and tell it what to do. (This is in addition to launching Assistant by saying "OK, Google" or long-pressing the home button.) You can also squeeze the Pixel 2's sides to silence your ringing phone, but that's it. In general, I didn't use the squeeze feature all that much, and it would be better if you could program the squeeze to launch an app of your choice. Out of habit, I mostly launched Assistant through the Home button.. Don't sweat if you're around water, the Pixel 2 can take a plunge.. Aside from physical changes, Google refreshed the lock and home screen too. The phone has an Always On lock screen now, showing missed notifications and messages when the screen is off. The lock screen also displays Music Detection, which is a Pixel-exclusive feature that runs continuously in the background. Whenever the phone picks up a song (for example, in a store or a car), it'll look up the artist and song and list it on your lock screen. This feature works offline and on Airplane Mode, and if you're uncomfortable with your phone "always listening" you can disable it.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

The Pixel 2 brings exclusive Google Assistant features you can't get on any other phone, and lets you trigger them with a squeeze.. The Pixel 2 (starting at $649) combines pure Google software and a great camera in a one-hand-friendly size. But while its specs generally measure up to the larger Pixel 2 XL , its design and performance don't quite get there. That makes the XL our Editors' Choice, and the phone to get if you want the full Google experience.. In an era of tiny-bezel phones, the Pixel 2 is a bit of a throwback. At 5.7 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and 5.0 ounces, it fits very well into one hand. But its 5-inch, 1,920-by-1,080 OLED screen is bracketed by relatively large top and bottom bezels, much like you see on the iPhone 8 .. As a 16:9 phone, the Pixel 2 is the same width as the Samsung Galaxy S8 , which has a much bigger screen; the S8 is taller and narrower, and lacks the large top and bottom bezels. The Pixel 2's screen also looks a bit yellowish, while the Pixel 2 XL is bluer and the Galaxy S8 is balanced in the middle.. View All 5 Photos in Gallery. The matte metal-and-glass back feels like a warm ceramic, with a pleasant interplay of textures. The phone comes in black, white, or a blue-gray, and is IP67 water resistant. It comes in 64GB and 128GB models. Our 64GB model had 52GB available.. The fingerprint sensor is on the back of the phone. The big bezels here are ostensibly for the front-facing speakers, although the Pixel 2 XL manages to get in both front-facing speakers and smaller bezels. There are a few features missing that power users might want, but they aren't surprises: There's no memory card slot, no headphone jack, and no dual-SIM version.. The Pixels may have very different bodies, but they have the same modem and LTE performance. That means a Category 15, 800Mbps modem supporting all of the US bands except T-Mobile's new Band 71, which will cover rural areas in the future. (For Band 71, you need an LG V30 right now.) The phone is 600Mbps on Sprint because it lacks 4x4 MIMO on Sprint's Band 41, but it has 4x4 MIMO for the other US and Canadian carriers (even Freedom!), which extends coverage and speed in weak signal areas. According to modem experts, the Pixel has the hardware for gigabit LTE, but Google chose not to support the full spec.. Wi-Fi support is excellent, on par with the Samsung Galaxy phones. The Pixel 2 XL also has Bluetooth 5.0 and NFC.. Those big front-facing speakers really pay off with the Pixel 2's speakerphone, which is very loud, if rather harsh. Loud but harsh is also how we'd describe the earpiece voice tone; we prefer the Pixel 2 XL, which has a rounder sound, if not quite as loud. Noise cancellation is fine, if not industry-leading.. The Pixel only has a 2,700mAh battery, but Google's software has always been great at conserving power. We got 8 hours, 48 minutes of LTE streaming on our Pixel 2, which is terrific for a small phone like this. It doesn't quite measure up to the Pixel 2 XL (9 hours, 25 minutes), but of course, the XL has more room inside. The phone supports fast charging, but not wireless charging.. When it comes to software and performance, you're getting pretty much the same experience here that you do on the Pixel 2 XL for $200 more — and it's a beautiful, Google-centric experience.. That starts with Android 8.0 Oreo , and assures you of timely updates for at least the next few years. It continues with a lack of redundant OEM apps and carrier bloatware, as long as you don't buy the phone from Verizon. Google's calendar and messaging apps look better than other manufacturers', and unlike on Samsung phones, you won't end up juggling two different browsers or two different calendar apps. Google has put a few exclusive twists on Android here. I like the new feature that listens to ambient music and tells you what's playing automatically, right on your lock screen. But when I tried it with ten songs, it only worked on four of them. Google says it's primed with the most popular tracks, and it'll be updated as time goes on. Google Lens has some promise; it's a feature that automatically recognizes text in photos or lets you look up books, albums, artwork, and locations in Google Photos. It worked easily on books I tried, but it's not a huge differentiator, and I kept forgetting it was there.. But the star of the show, clearly, is Google Assistant, Google's voice interface that's more conversational, flexible, and knowledgeable than Siri or Bixby. You can activate the Assistant in a bunch of different ways. You can turn on an option to have it recognize your voice even when the phone's screen is off, for example. I ended up using the squeeze sensor a lot. Introduced originally on HTC's U11 , the sensor lets you squeeze the phone slightly below its midriff to launch the Assistant (but no other app). It even works when the phone is in a case.. You could argue that performance is smoother on the Pixel 2 than on the XL, because the same 2.46GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor with 4GB of RAM is pushing fewer screen pixels. In our benchmarks, that showed up as higher gaming frame rates for the smaller phone. But in actual practice, we didn't see any difference in the UI or in-game performance.. Higher frame rates would mean good things for VR , but if you're interested in VR, the Pixel 2 isn't the phone to get. I tried the Pixel 2 with Google's new $99 Daydream View headset. The new headset is comfortable and costs less than Samsung's $129 Gear VR. But the Pixel 2's 440ppi screen isn't dense enough for a comfortable VR experience. Individual pixels in VR apps are much too visible, and text, especially, would pulse and shift as I moved my head around. For VR headset use, you should get a phone with a higher-density screen, like the Pixel 2 XL, LG V30, or Samsung Galaxy Note 8 .. Also, like on the iPhone 8, Google absolutely insists that its augmented reality system works just fine with one camera. It showed off a few AR demos at a media event—the usual furniture-placement app, a game, and an app that adds 3D fictional characters to your photos—but it still feels like Google's ARCore is well behind Apple's ARKit in terms of developer support so far.. As mentioned earlier, the Pixel 2's front-facing speakers are loud, but they sound tinny compared with the richer audio coming out of the Pixel 2 XL. The lack of a headphone jack will hurt a bit, especially because Google doesn't even include headphones here, just a dongle.. Google clearly wants to push you toward Bluetooth, and it's pushing a new "fast pairing" technique that's supposed to make it easier to pair your Bluetooth headset. Right now, though, it only works with a handful of headsets: the Libratone QAdapt Over Ear , Google's own Pixel Buds , the Plantronics V8200, the Bose QuietComfort 35 II , and some headphones made by a company named AiAiAi. That said, I didn't have any trouble pairing the phone to my Plantronics Voyager UC headset.. The Pixel 2's 12.2-megapixel, f/1.8 camera is among the best of its kind. We've seen, testing smartphone cameras recently, that 12 or 13 megapixels is about the top limit of low-light quality on a smartphone sensor; anything more, like the 16 megapixels on LG's V30, is wasted in low light.. Google's Pixel camera software is very simple, without RAW support, manual mode, or many scene settings; Google encourages you to strike out and get that stuff through third-party camera apps. Currently, the flagship software feature is Motion Photos, which, like Apple's Live Photos, capture a snippet of video with each picture. The phone also has a software bokeh mode that works on both the front and rear cameras.. Upgrades are coming, showing that this camera app isn't a fixed point. Google says that an upgrade "in the coming weeks" for the phone's HDR capabilities will enhance image quality in mixed lighting.. We tested the Pixel 2 against the Pixel 2 XL and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8/S8. They're all terrific in good light. In low light, we were surprised to see some differences between the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL models, given that they supposedly have the same camera. But we saw them: Every once in a while, the Pixel didn't judge colors in low light quite as well as its bigger counterpart. Maybe that was because of shifting light when we were taking our test photos, but it was enough to cement our decision in favor of the Pixel 2 XL.. Both Pixels are able to maintain slightly faster shutter speeds in low light than the Galaxy S8 does, which gives you more of a fighting chance against blur, and they don't do the hideous overprocessing that the LG V30 does. That makes them the best smartphone cameras out there right now.. There's only one main camera, but that's less concerning on a $649, 5-inch phone than it is on the bigger Pixel 2 XL. Competing phones at this size and price range don't generally have dual cameras.. There's a smooth set of stair steps up the Android flagship price ladder. The OnePlus 5 costs $479. The Galaxy S8 clocks in around $720, the Pixel 2 XL is $849, and the Galaxy Note 8 is in the $900 zone.. This becomes a question of sweet spots, and I just don't think the Pixel 2 is it. If you're just looking for a good, affordable Android phone, the OnePlus 5 is pretty great. If you're looking for the Pixel experience, the XL is superior. And I still love the body design of the Samsung Galaxy S8, the most elegantly built phone on the market.. This isn't to say that the Pixel 2 is a bad phone. It's suffering from the same problem that the iPhone 8 is, which is being the lower-middle child in a crowded field of good choices. As it is, it's our fourth (or so) choice for a higher-end Android phone, which is more of a statement about the strength of the Android field than the weakness of the Pixel 2. If you're aching for a Pixel this year, go big.. And if you buy one, buy it from Google. Verizon is selling the Pixel as well, but it'll be laden with bloatware and harder to hack. As Google has a 24-month financing program (bringing the phone's price to $27.04 per month), getting the unlocked model straight from the source is your best bet..

The Pixel 2 has become my go to phone since I started using it a couple of months ago. Featuring a clean Android install the phone’s software is the best currently available and a pleasing step up on the skinned versions of the OS you’ll find on the Galaxy S8 and HTC U11.. The clean install also means the Pixel 2 has aged fairly well. To date I’ve not experienced any slow down on performance. Battery life also remains the same, with it generally still lasting a full day’s average use off a single charge. Though it generally takes around six months for an serious battery degradation to occur on a phone, so that’s to be expected.. Build quality is excellent, with the phone’s black case remaining scratch and chip free, despite an accidental drop onto a hardwood floor. The only slight downside is that with the iPhone X and company out, the Pixel 2’s bezel-heavy design looks a little dated.. The only real issue is that I still find the lack of a 3.5mm jack to be a pain. Even though the Pixel 2 comes with a USB C converter, it’s all too easy to lose or break. I managed to lose the first converter within days of using the Pixel 2, and the second I bought snapped while the phone was in my pocket. I know this is an issue on pretty much every flagship smartphone these days, it remains an annoyance that stops me using any of the decent cabled headphones I’ve invested in.. The Pixel 2 is Google’s second attempt at creating an Android version of the iPhone 8 and a proper competitor to the Samsung Galaxy S8.. Instead of focusing solely on top-end specs and including every feature imaginable, it aims to aims to offer users the cleanest Android experience possible.. For the most part this means you’re getting the best of Google in a phone; however, there remain a few areas where improvement is still needed.. The smaller of the two Pixel devices is rumoured to have been made by HTC – to a Google design, of course – but there’s very little of the Taiwanese firm’s DNA in this phone. Actually, the Google Pixel 2 feels very different to any other Android phone I’ve used this year.. Even though it’s constructed from aluminium, the back has a stoney-like finish. It’s harsh and textured; strange at first but, ultimately, super-nice. It’s far grippier in the hand than shiny aluminium and isn’t as slippery when sat on a table the same way a glass back is. Neither does it appear to pick up fingerprints. It does give the impression that it might scratch off over time, but we’ll have to wait and see if that becomes an issue..

Aside from adding contrast to the metal, this is where all the cellular and Wi-Fi antennas live. Giving them plenty of space should help connectivity, but it also means there are no antenna bands elsewhere. Hopefully this glass panel will be less prone to scratching – which was a real issue with the first device.. The rear of the Google Pixel 2 is well designed, then, but the front appears a little old-fashioned. Unlike the Pixel 2 XL or Samsung Galaxy S8 , the Pixel 2 has a huge chin and forehead either side of the 5-inch display. The bezel here is more substantial than seen on the iPhone 8 , it’s even bigger than the Xperia XZ1. Overall, the Pixel 2 isn’t much smaller than the Samsung Galaxy S8, but the latter sports a much bigger 5.8-inch screen.. It seems odd that Google has taken this design route, especially since more and more device makers are opting for a bezel-less look. At least Google has used that extra space on both ends of the phone to add dual front-facing stereo speakers – but it’s still hard to forgive in 2017.. Like most flagship phones this year, the Pixel 2 is IP67-rated for water-resistance. Another, less desirable, trend Google has decided to follow is the removal of the headphone jack. I can only assume the decision was taken to enable waterproofing, but it’s a shame. And even though you get a USB-C to 3.5mm port dongle in the box and there are plenty of ‘Made for Google’ USB-C headphones coming soon, it’s annoying nevertheless..

There isn’t a whole lot to get excited about with regards to the Pixel 2’s screen. As in the first iteration of the device, it’s a 5-inch, 1080p AMOLED panel that looks good but is far short of stunning.. AMOLED panels are renowned for offering more saturated colours, perfect blacks and better contrast over their LCD counterparts. But I’m sure that the main reason Google opts for these panels is because OLED is necessary for Daydream VR to work – which, of course, is a big push for Google.. I’m a huge fan of AMOLED displays, but they’re not perfect. The panel on the Pixel 2 edges towards the warm side, so you’ll likely. find that whites will have a slightly orangey tinge. Note that Google doesn’t offer any capability to adjust colours on the display, which is annoying if you prefer a slightly cooler screen.. Related: What is IP67 ?. Probably the single biggest feature lacking from the panels on both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL is support for high dynamic range, or HDR. The ability to playback HDR10 and Dolby Vision content from the likes of Amazon and Netflix is available on the Galaxy Note 8 , LG V30 and upcoming iPhone X – but it isn’t available on the Pixel 2. This is by no means a deal-breaker, but it’s an odd feature to leave out when Google Play Movies and YouTube offer HDR support.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. The best camera on a smartphone. The Pixel 2 clues us in on why Google called its phone series Pixel: it was building the best camera on a phone. This second-generation effort fulfills that promise with not only the best-in-class photos, but also dual front-facing speakers and water-resistance. It's a great size, but you'll need to be okay with its dated looks and the fact that there’s no headphone jack.. Bezels really stand out in 2018. Want something larger? Check out our Google Pixel 2 XL review Price and release date Starts at $649 / £629 / AU$1,079 for 64GB model Announced October 4, shipped Thursday, October 19 In the US, try Verizon if the Google Store still has delays New Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL photo examples. Design Great size and likable design Squeeze the sides to launch Google Assistant Waterproof, but no 3.5mm headphone jack Screen Full HD 1080p screen is bright and colorful Thick bezels make it far from an all-screen phone Not the best choice for Google Daydream VR. The Google Pixel 2 is here to prove that two rear cameras aren’t always better than one on a phone, especially if you favor photo quality over the latest all-screen designs. We have the picture proof below.. It’s Google’s superior software that pushes this Android Oreo phone to snap the best-looking pictures we’ve seen, topping the camera on last year’s impressive Pixel and Pixel XL debut.. What’s more, this year's upgrade is faster, water-resistant and adds a new way to call up the Google Assistant: simply squeeze the phone’s sides to launch your new AI buddy. It sounds like a gimmick, but it’s easier than accidentally hitting another (Bixby) button.. Watch our design and screen review of the Google Pixel 2 series below.. The Pixel 2, with its 5-inch screen, doesn’t look like the future of smartphones, except for its lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack – you're going to want a pair of our best Bluetooth headphones for this one.. Unlike the Pixel 2 XL, which has an edge-to-edge 6-inch display and tall 18:9 aspect ratio, the Pixel 2 is bezel-heavy.. Of course, we now know it has more vibrant colors and no signs (yet) of screen burn-in problems like its larger counterpart. Depending on how the XL screen performs in the long run, the Pixel 2 may actually be a case of "better small than sorry.". The bezels won't bother you if you want a phone that’s a great size, runs smart software and has a fantastic camera that will make your friends – even your Samsung-owning friends – jealous. The Pixel 2 is for people who favor functionality over fashion.. Update : Google Pixel 2 remains one of our favorite phone in 2018 – despite technical issues at launch – for one reason: it has an amazing camera and starts at a normal smartphone price. And it has recently gotten even better thanks to Google awaking the Pixel Visual Core, the phone's co-processor dedicated to imaging, in the February software release.. Your only issue may be finding one in stock, as Google in the US and UK is sold out. Luckily, it's readily in stock at Verizon and via Google Pixel 2 deals .. The Google Pixel 2 price didn't increase year-over-year, so like its dated design, it isn't keeping up with the competition. This is surprising for a phone announced on October 4, and a release date of October 19.. It costs $649 / £629 / AU$1,079 for the 64GB version, and $749 / £729 / AU$1,229 for the 128GB configuration. In the US, this phone is sold on-contract through Verizon only among carriers, but worry not, ordering it from the Google Store will mean it works on all networks, including AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint.. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL have the same camera, and our very own Cameron Faulkner had both on his honeymoon to give us example of photos people take outside of a testing lab. Check out some of the shots below, then continue to read out review.. The Google Pixel 2 has a likable size and aesthetic, if you can look past the fact that the phone won’t wow you with an all-screen front. It has a futuristic camera, but the design has a distinctly last-year feel to it.. It easily fits into one hand thanks to its palmable dimensions and light weight. A few years ago this would’ve been considered a phablet, but today, next to the Note 8 , it’s a normal-sized Android phone. Most will be able to manage one-handed operation of its 5-inch screen, something that's literally a tall order with the 6-inch Pixel 2 XL.. Both new Pixel phones are now IP67 waterproof (meaning they can survive underwater up to 1m or 3.3ft down for an hour) and retain a glass-and-metal design on the back, albeit with less glass toward the top compared to their predecessors.. The fingerprint scanner has been moved – don’t worry, it’s not off-center, as on Samsung’s new phones – onto the textured aluminum portion of the back, while the camera remains on the glass part, and has a protective ring around it now.. You won’t find a headphone jack on this phone, nor even USB-C earbuds inside the box – it comes with just a simple 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter. Google may have done some research and figured out that you probably own better headphones than the ones it usually supplies for free – plus, it’s all the more reason for you to buy into those Pixel Buds that just launched , right?. Music on this phone sounds great through headphones, and we even liked listening to music through the dual front-facing stereo speakers. Yes, there's an odd ticking noise coming from some Pixel 2 speakers, but Google promises a software fix for this issue.. Front-facing stereo speakers have become rare among smartphones, which too often fire onboard audio out of the bottom of the phone through a single speaker. Having them increases the size of the top and bottom bezel, but stereo speakers are part of the functionality-over-fashion trade-off we’re talking about.. The Pixel 2 also acquires a feature from the HTC U11 called EdgeSense. Squeezing the phone’s sides launches the Google Assistant, which in our experience has come in handy, and is way better than adding a dedicated AI button – Samsung uses such a button for its Bixby assistant, and we can’t stop accidentally pressing it on the Galaxy S8 and Note 8. Our only complaint is that Google won’t allow you to customize this squeezable feature to open up the camera or another app of your choice.. The Pixel 2 comes in three colors: Just Black, Clearly White, Kinda Blue. Check out our gallery of the Clearly White model below.. The 5-inch Google Pixel 2 display looks superb for Full HD, but it’s also uninspiring at the same time. It’s bright and colorful, though not as rich as a best-in-class Samsung smartphone screen.. What’s distracting is its screen-to-body ratio, with large bezels flanking the screen on all sides. This is even more noticeable in 2018 with so many all-screen Android phones around, including the bigger Google Pixel 2 XL – and it's especially distracting when the standard trio of on-screen buttons are sometimes displayed within a black bar that eats into your precious screen space.. The display works okay with Google Daydream , but it’s less than ideal given the fact that you can see individual pixels at 1080p. The headset really calls for the Quad HD display from the Pixel 2 XL.. We did like the new always-on display, which shows the date, time and notification icons, and the overdue double-tap-to-wake-the-screen functionality. It’s now a lot easier to see what’s going on with your phone before you wake it up.. You just have to get beyond the bezels, and the fact that putting your Google Pixel 2 in a case makes the outline seem even more pronounced.. Next Page What's it like to use?.

Everything you need to know about the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. No, the January Pixel 2 update did not bring screen burn-in improvements. At a jam-packed October 4 conference in San Francisco, Google announced the Google Home Mini , a high-end Chromebook called the Pixelbook , and a new Daydream View virtual reality headset. But the undisputed highlights were the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, two high-end smartphones designed with enthusiasts in mind.. They’re a step above your average phones. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL , the newest version of Google’s Android operating system, and they carry the torch for Google’s premium program. In many ways, they’re the search giant’s vision of ideal smartphones. In an earnings call, Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai said the Pixel 2 and 2 XL’s pre-orders on day one “were more than double what they were last year.”. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL run Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box, the latest version of Google’s operating system, and have features you won’t find in other Oreo-touting devices. On top of that, both phones have just been treated to an update that could fix some issues users have been complaining about.. In January 2018, Google started pushing an update to Pixel and Pixel 2 phones. While the update was pretty basic, providing minor security and setting updates, Phone Area reported that the update contained “anti-aging update improvements” to possibly address screen burn-in. A spokesperson from Google denied the claim stating, “Phone Arena understands that there are no new burn-in fixes in the January update; there is a minor update to an existing setting.”. In the update, perhaps the biggest change. is the addition of three display options — Boosted, Natural, and Saturated. If you feel like the colors on your Pixel or Pixel XL are a little washed out or boring, you probably want the Saturated option. The update also lowers the maximum screen brightness and fades away the navigation controls if you’re not using them, in an attempt to fix the burn-in issues some have been complaining about. Last but not least, is the faint clicking noise some Pixel users have noted. It seems as though that noise was a software issue rather than a hardware one — and as such has been fixed in the update.. One of the most dramatic features you will only find on Pixel devices is an upgraded Pixel Launcher , the app that powers the phones’ home screens. Google search bar has moved from the top of the screen to the bottom, where’s it’s easier to reach with your thumbs. There’s a new “daily briefing” widget that shows the current weather, temperature, and upcoming calendar entries, and a completely transparent notification and navigation bar.. feature of the Google Assistant that’s exclusive to the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, uses “always-on” three-microphone technology and on-device machine learning to listen for tunes nearby. If it identifies a match, you’ll see a handy. link to the corresponding Google Play Music store listing in the notifications shade. And if the Pixel or Pixel 2 XL’s low-power Always-On Display mode is enabled, you’ll see a persistent black-and-white alert on the lock screen.. That’s all in addition to Android 8.0 Oreo features like Notification Channels, which let you toggle categories of alerts on a per-app basis, and Notification Badges, which mimic iOS’ unread badge counters. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg — Oreo has a picture-in-picture mode, an Autofill service that remembers your app login passwords, and a battery-optimizing task manager that quashes misbehaving background apps.. For a full rundown, check out our guide to Android 8.0 Oreo .. A major advantage of the Pixel-series phones is that they’re typically the first to get new version of Android, and the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are no different. Google says that both will get three years of software upgrades.. At the event on October 4, Google highlighted ARCore , an augmented reality framework that powers ARKit -like experiences. Unlike the search giant’s hardware-based Project Tango , which requires special sensors, ARCore is compatible with the Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, and any Android device running 7.0 Nougat or later. Apps that take advantage project digital characters onto real-world objects by detecting horizontal surfaces and reading the surrounding environment’s ambient light.. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL also support AR Stickers which will be available in the Pixel camera. It projects digital stickers onto surfaces, and early partners include Saturday Night Live, YouTube, Disney, the NBA, and Netflix.. From a distance, you’d be hard-pressed to tell the Pixel 2 and its predecessor, the 2016 Pixel , apart. The two handsets have the same rounded corners in common, and the same thick bezels above and below the 5-inch, 1080p (1920 x 1080 pixels) wide-color gamut, 24-bit P-OLED screen that can display 16.7 million colors. The front camera hasn’t budged from the top-left corner of the front panel, and the Pixel 2’s rear features the same two-toned, minimalist design as last year’s Pixel. With the exception of an etched “G” logo toward the bottom, a camera in the left-hand corner, and a Google-branded fingerprint sensor that unlocks “faster than any smartphone,” the Pixel 2’s unibody is a familiar sea of glass, soft-touch plastic, and “hybrid” aluminum.. But some things have changed, and mostly (but not all) for the better. The Pixel 2 has two speakers — one above the screen and one below — in stereo configuration. Gone is the first-gen Pixel’s awkward camera silhouette, as is the 16:9 aspect ratio. The display is now 18:9 , just like the LG G6 , which means apps in Android’s split-screen multitasking view get an equitable amount of screen real estate. And like the iPhone 7 , Moto Z2 Force , and HTC U Ultra before it, the Pixel 2 does away with the headphone jack. The Pixel 2 ships with a USB-C-to-3.5mm adapter, but if you leave it behind without a pair of Bluetooth earbuds handy, you’ll have to borrow someone else’s.. Read our Pixel 2 review to learn more about the smartphone.. While the Pixel 2 looks more or less like last year’s model, the Pixel 2 XL is a different story. The 6-inch QHD (2,560 x 1,440 pixels) P-OLED display stretches from the far-left side to the far right, stopping just short of the Pixel 2 XL’s rounded edges. The screen’s corners are curved on all four sides, and it’s much taller than the Pixel 2’s. There’s barely enough room for the stereo speakers and front camera.. The rest of the Pixel 2 XL is less trailblazing. It’s got the same two-tone design as the Pixel 2, down to the rear camera’s placement, fingerprint sensor, and Google logo. And just like the Pixel 2, it eschews a 3.5mm headphone jack connector for a single USB-C port.. You can check out our Pixel 2 XL review to see our thoughts on the phone.. Somewhat surprisingly, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL’s designs are about the only thing that set them apart. They’re in many ways cut from the same cloth.. IP67 dust- and water-resistant, which means they can survive being submerged in up to three feet of water for 30 minutes, and their touchscreens boast shatter- and scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass 5. On Project Fi , they use eSIM technology to switch between cell networks on the fly. And both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL have Active Edge, capacitive bezels that trigger Google’s AI Assistant, silence phone calls, snap photos, and launch other apps when squeezed (à. la the HTC U11 ).. Under the hood, the new Pixel phones pack Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 , an octa-core system-on-chip that boasts a 27 percent performance advantage over the first-gen Pixel phones’ Snapdragon 821. It’s paired with 4GB of RAM, Bluetooth 5.0 radios, and up to 128GB of internal storage, and charges quickly thanks to compatibility with USB Power Delivery .. Generally speaking, five minutes of charging delivers five hours of battery life with the included 18W charging adapter. And with a 27W adapter, you’ll get even faster charging speeds.. If there’s one area where the Pixel 2 XL has the advantage, it’s battery life. Google pegs its 3,520mAh battery at a “full two days” on a charge, compared to the. 2,700mAh Pixel 2 battery’s “full day.”. Last year’s Pixel phones had spectacular cameras that rivaled that of the iPhone, and the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL don’t rest on their laurels. They earned a score of 98 from DXOMark, the photography agency’s highest-ever rating. Google’s head of hardware, Rick Osterloh, describes them as “best in class” sensors that “completely revolutionize” the photo-taking experience.. A custom-designed Google imaging chip powers the cameras in both phones: An 8-megapixel f/2.4 aperture sensor on front, and a single-lens 12.2-megapixel rear f/1.8 aperture rear camera with optical image stabilization, phase detection autofocus, and high dynamic range (HDR). Google calls it the Pixel Camera, and it’s capable of all sorts of software tricks that the first-gen Pixel phones weren’t.. Google uses what’s called Fused Video stabilization — a combination of the aforementioned optical image stabilization and electronic image stabilization — to smooth out jerky videos automatically.. One is an iPhone Portrait Mode -like bokeh mode that captures in-focus foregrounds and out-of-focus backgrounds (Google says that thanks to machine learning, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL don’t need a second camera to achieve the effect). Another, Motion Photos, snaps three-second video clips before and after a picture is taken (think Apple’s Live Photos).. But the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL’s cameras can do more than snap great photos. They’re the leading platform for Google Lens , an AI photo analyzer than can pick out books, DVD covers, architectural landmarks, and more. Thanks to Google-designed machine-learning chips that process more than 180 trillion floating point operations per second, Google Lens can give a description of a building in a photo, identify the artist of a painting, or even enter a Wi-Fi password automatically from a photo of the underside of a Wi-Fi router.. Given all that technology, you’d be forgiven for expecting the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL Pixel to cost an arm and a leg. But both come in below the $900-plus asking prices of the Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone X .. The Pixel 2 (in “just black,” “clearly white,” and “kinda blue” colors) is available in 64GB and 128GB storage configurations for $650 and $750 unlocked, respectively. Alternatively, you can opt for Google’s monthly financing, which is $27.04 per month for the 64GB model and $31.21 per month for the 128GB model. (in black and white) comes in the same sizes as the Pixel 2 — 64GB or 128GB — for $850 and $950, respectively. A 24-month installment plan for the 64GB starts at $35.38 per month and $39.54 per month for the 128GB. If you’re looking to purchase the phones from a carrier, you’ll have to be on Verizon as Big Red is the exclusive carrier selling the phone. You can still purchase them from Google unlocked and they will work on all major U.S. For accessories, Google launched a Made For Google. program with a strong list of accessory makers, similar to Apple’s Made For iPhone program..

They were announced during a Google event on October 4, 2017, as the successors to the Pixel and Pixel XL. They were released on October 19, 2017, and serve as the second set of smartphones in the Google Pixel hardware line.. In early March 2017, Google's Rick Osterloh confirmed that they would bring a "next-gen" Pixel phone later that year. He stated it would "stay premium" and that there would be no "cheap Pixel". Google originally intended to use HTC to manufacture both their 2017 flagships, but later shifted to LG to manufacture the bigger Pixel 2 XL. The unreleased device that was supposed to be the Pixel 2 XL under the codename "Muskie", was later re-developed by HTC into the HTC U11+. The Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are currently carried in the United States by Verizon and Project Fi .. The back of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL is made from aluminum with a thin "premium coating" of plastic and has a top section made from glass to provide wireless transmissivity. [4] Unlike the original Pixel XL, which was simply an enlarged version of the Pixel design with no other changes, the Pixel 2 XL's external design differs from its smaller sibling, employing a taller 18:9 P-OLED display instead of the Pixel 2's 16:9 AMOLED.. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are both powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 , coupled with 4. GB LPDDR4X RAM. They both come in storage options of 64 or 128 GB.. The Pixel 2 sports a 5-inch (130. mm) AMOLED display panel with 1920× 1080 resolution, coming in at around 441. ppi , while the Pixel 2 XL comes with a 6-inch (150. mm) P-OLED display panel with a 18:9 aspect ratio and a 2880× 1440 resolution at 538. Both phones have a 12.2 megapixel rear camera capable of recording 4K video at 30 FPS, 1080p video at 120 FPS, and 720p video at 240 FPS. The camera also contains phase-detection autofocus, laser autofocus, and HDR+ processing. Pixel 2 owners receive free unlimited storage for all photos and videos taken on the phone in original quality through the end of 2020, with unlimited high-quality storage continuing afterwards. [5] The Pixel 2 camera received a score of 98 from DxOMark , making it the highest performing mobile device camera that they have tested. [6] The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL also include the Intel -designed Pixel Visual Core image processor for faster and lower power image processing , [7] though it was not enabled until Android 8.1 was released in January 2018. [8] [9] The camera does not allow capturing Raw images and lacks manual controls. Unlike Apple 's iPhone 8 and IPhone X , the Pixels do not have support for 4K video at 60 FPS, as the processor is not powerful enough. [10] [11] Although the camera has Optical Image Stabilization it is unable to remove some high frequency vibrations that other smartphones are able to remove. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL support USB Power Delivery quick charging, has a fingerprint sensor on the rear, has IP67 dust and water resistance and is Daydream -ready. The phones ship with stock Android 8.0 "Oreo" on launch. Google has promised three years of software and security updates, [14] making it closer to the average four years of support that Apple provides for its iPhones. The new Pixels also include a feature called "Active Edge". With this, the Google Assistant can be launched by squeezing the phone's sides, similar to the HTC U11 's "Edge Sense" feature.. This phone was also released with the new Google Lens app, which is designed to bring up relevant information using visual analysis by the camera. Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL also automatically reverse searches songs which are playing around the device. Android 8.1 Oreo was released for the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL on December 5, 2017. The Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL received mixed reviews. The phone was praised for the camera quality and water resistance, [18] but was criticized for the removal of the headphone jack , [19] particularly after Google mocked Apple for doing the same with its iPhone 7 phone at the launch of the first generation Pixel phone. [20] Google was also criticized for the price of the USB-C to 3.5. mm headphone adapter it sells, which costs US$20 while Apple's Lightning to 3.5. mm adapter costs US$9, [21] as well as for not including headphones with the phone. However, news outlets noted that because USB-C is a standard interface, unlike Lightning, there are a variety of third-party adapters that retail for less than Google's official one. [22] Google later dropped the price of the adapter to US$9, keeping the price in-line with Apple's offering. YouTuber JerryRigEverything , who performs durability tests on various smartphones, criticized Google for their design choice with the antenna lines on the sides of the handset. When he bent the Pixel 2, it cracked at the antenna line near the middle of the phone, voiding its water resistance and warranty, while most other phones from competitors pass his bend test. This does not apply to the Pixel 2 XL. The design of the smaller Pixel 2 was regarded as plain, and its big chunky bezels were not well received, considering that earlier 2017 phones like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6 had moved to nearly bezel-less screens. The Pixel 2 XL screen became infamous for quality control issues, a flaw shared with the LG V30 which also has the same manufacturer and P-OLED screen type. The Pixel 2 XL has a blue tint visible on the screen when the phone is viewed at an angle. Many were dissatisfied [30] [31] and it was speculated that Google had installed the polarizer incorrectly. [32] However, when Google addressed the tint, they stated that it was a design choice to have the blue tint to go along with the cooler color temperature used by the screen (it is calibrated to a D67 white point , which is 6700K). Vlad Savov of The Verge has complained of under-saturated and distorted OLED displays, [35] and there have also been reports of screen burn-in on some Pixel 2 XL units. The Pixel 2 XL also suffers from a "black smear" problem, which occurs when a group of black pixels transition to colored ones, and tend to linger for a while, before changing to their expected state. Google conducted an investigation and said that a software update would be coming soon that would add a new mode for more saturated colors, reducing the maximum brightness of the Pixel 2 XL devices by 50 cd/m 2 to reduce load on the display, and fading out the navigation bar after a period of inactivity. [39] The November security patch came with three new screen modes that Google promised earlier, [40] although Google has also said that further enhancements would be included in a separate software update to be released in December. [41] Google also extended device warranty to two years for both devices worldwide. Some Pixel 2 XL devices also fail to register touch near the edges of the screen. [43] Android 8.1 fixes this issue. Hundreds of Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL owners have been complaining of high-pitched and clicking sounds coming from the phone. [45] Google investigated the issue and recommended turning off NFC to temporarily fix the problem until a software update comes out. [46] [47] The November security patch fixed the clicking sound as well as the KRACK WPA2 Wi-Fi security issue, however, it did not fix the buzzing sounds heard during calls on some devices. Google has promised a fix in a future update. Some Pixel 2 XL units suffer from poor audio recording quality. The recorded audio is high-pitched and distorted. [49] Android 8.1 fixes this issue. The Pixel 2 XL has a volume flaw that reduces the sound level of audio clips sent through messaging apps such as Google Allo , Instagram , and Telegram among others. Google is aware of the problem and is looking into it. Some Pixel 2 XL devices were shipped to consumers without an operating system, rendering them unusable. The Pixel 2 XL comes with a charger capable of fast charging at 18 W , but the phone is not able to charge at more than 10.5W, taking two and a half hours for a full charge. [56] Below 20°C (68°F) the charging speed is just a mere 3-4W, but the phone will still display "Charging rapidly", which is misleading. The Pixel 2 XL has an issue where the screen may flash randomly. It occurs when the phone is locked or unlocked. There is an issue where Google Assistant does not work with some Bluetooth headphones. Many users are reporting that unlocked devices have a locked bootloader. [60] [61] Google fixed the issue, but the solution includes factory resetting the device. Multiple users reported that the microphone can randomly stop working. A possible solution is to blow into the microphone. Some units suffer from Bluetooth connectivity issues. The phones are known to randomly reboot. Google has promised a fix in the coming weeks. [65] The random reboots are believed to be caused by the LTE modem. Google has not been able to fix this issue in the latest Android 8.1 release. The Android 8.1 update introduces a regression in the Pixel 2 XL making the fingerprint sensor slower. Some of the USB-C to 3.5mm adapters for the headphones do not work. In some cases, rebooting the phone can fix the issue temporarily. Google is offering replacements for the faulty adapters. Some Pixel 2 XL suffer from speaker rattling when playing content or even during phone calls. The phones have issues with Wi-Fi mesh networks, where disconnects are common. Google is already investigating this issue. Users are reporting battery drain issues after the February security update. Google is already looking for a fix. In the United States, Verizon and Project Fi are the exclusive carriers for the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. They are available direct-to-consumer for use on any wireless network through Google's online store, or from Best Buy and Target. ^ a b c d "These are the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL | VentureBeat".

I Spent a Week Comparing the iPhone X, Google Pixel 2 and Samsung Galaxy S8. I Spent a Week Comparing the iPhone X, Google Pixel 2 and Samsung Galaxy S8. If you’re shopping for a new smartphone, there’s a good chance three options immediately come to mind: the iPhone X, the Galaxy S8, or the Google Pixel 2.. Your buying decision might come down to whether you’re more comfortable using iOS or Android. But for those who are struggling to decide which phone is best, or simply just want to get a better sense of how each phone differs from one another, here’s a closer look at the iPhone X , Google Pixel 2 XL and Samsung Galaxy S8 .. While more powerful processors, sharper cameras, and better screens have become routine annual updates, 2017 was the year that smartphone makers began to rethink design, too. All three companies released new phones with screens that cover nearly the entire front of the device, resulting in a look that’s more slick while also offering more screen space. And, most importantly, the new edge-to-edge design on the iPhone X, Galaxy S8, and Google Pixel XL means you’re getting a bigger screen in a phone that’s not noticeably larger, which makes them easier to hold than big-screened devices of years past.. That’s especially true when it comes to the iPhone X — it’s only slightly larger than the iPhone 8, but includes a screen that’s even more spacious than that of the bigger iPhone 8 Plus. Apple , Samsung, and Google achieve this by making the borders around the display smaller, allowing them to fit more screen real estate on the device. Both Samsung and Google have the camera situated in a strip that extends across the top of the screen for their respective phones’ cameras, while the iPhone X has a cutout in the top center which some have disparagingly called “the notch.”. I find the iPhone X to be the most elegant looking device, mostly because of its gorgeous glass back and stainless steel edges. But it also feels the most delicate, so I rarely get to appreciate that design, since I’m always covering it with a case. Some may prefer Samsung’s design primarily for its display, which slightly curves over the left and right edges of the phone, making it feel a bit more immersive than its rivals. It’s also the only phone of the three with a 3.5mm headphone jack, which means you can continue to use your older or non-Bluetooth headphones without an adapter. The glossy back panel of the phone, however, is quick to pick up fingerprint smudges. Of the three phones, Google’s Pixel 2 XL is the most practical to use without a case: Most of the phone’s back is covered in a matte material that’s easy to grip and isn’t as prone to smudges.. Get the latest deals, reviews and recommendations from the editors of TIME: sign up for The Goods newsletter here. The iPhone X, Galaxy S8, and Google Pixel 2 XL have screens that are capable of displaying rich color, bold text, and sharp detail. The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch OLED screen with a 2436 x 1125 resolution. Google’s Pixel 2 XL features a 6-inch OLED display with a 2880 x 1440 resolution. The Galaxy S8’s 5.8-inch OLED screen offers a 2960 x 1440 resolution.. While they all sound fantastically sharp on paper (and they are), there are a few differences to consider. Colors will sometimes appear more vivid and pronounced on Samsung’s smartphones, which can in certain instances make the iPhone X and Google Pixel 2 XL look muted in comparison. But this emphasis on color can be helpful or hindering depending on the situation and your preferences. For example, when browsing photos on National Geographic’s website, I found that the Galaxy S8 offered the best mix of color and detail. But I disliked the overabundant color when viewing the trailer for the upcoming film I, Tonya on all three devices side-by-side. There was one scene in which the shade of blue that star Margot Robbie was wearing looked so drastically different on the Galaxy S8 versus the iPhone X and Google Pixel 2 XL that it almost seemed like an entirely different color.. The iPhone X and Google Pixel 2 XL were more similar to one another, but I preferred the iPhone X’s screen the best because it was a bit brighter and bolder without exaggerating color too much. I also found it easier to read text on the iPhone X thanks to its True Tone technology, which adjusts the device’s white balance based on the surrounding lighting.. The Pixel 2 XL’s screen also appears to have a blueish tint when you’re not holding the phone directly in front of your face, which Pixel 2 XL owners have reported in the past. This isn’t always apparent in casual use, like when you’re viewing the screen from a straightforward angle. But it’s still noticeable, and it could be particularly annoying when watching videos with multiple people who may be looking at the phone from different angles. It has also been reported that the Pixel 2 XL’s display has a “burn-in” problem that leaves an imprint of an image on the display even after an app has been closed. But Google recently issued an update that should help fix this issue, and I had a difficult time recreating the problem on my own Pixel even when the reports first surfaced.. Read more: Apple Design Chief Jonathan Ive on the iPhone X: We Had to Solve ‘Extraordinarily Complex Problems’. If you’re considering switching from Android to the iPhone, or vice versa, software is where you’ll notice the biggest changes. Both operating systems have a different feel, each offering their own benefits and drawbacks.. Let’s start with the iPhone X: Ever since Apple unveiled the first iPhone, it refused to include any extraneous apps from carriers — content that’s often referred to as “bloatware.” That holds true today, and remains one of the iPhone’s biggest strengths when it comes to user interface design.. Aside, as Apple’s software has gotten more intelligent over the years, the iPhone has received some helpful flourishes , like the ability to automatically silence notifications while driving and a feature that translates languages in real time via Siri. It’s worth noting, however, that the iPhone X’s software differs slightly compared to other iPhones. That means even longtime Apple fans will experience a learning curve, since you’ll have to learn some new gestures to compensate for the iPhone X’s lack of a home button.. Samsung, meanwhile, has significantly improved its smartphone software in recent years in ways that make newer phones like the Galaxy S8 feel easier to navigate. But the interface is still a little bit busier than what you’ll find on the Google Pixel and the iPhone. Depending on which carrier you purchase the phone from, you may find some extraneous apps on your device — my review unit came with a few T-Mobile apps. That being said, the Galaxy S8’s software comes with some handy extras that may make it a better choice for power users. Samsung’s smartphone has a sidebar for adding shortcuts to favorite contacts and apps, as well as a tool for cropping screenshots and saving GIFs from videos you’re watching. Like the Google Pixel 2, you can view more than one app in split screen mode, as well as see the time, date, and other information even when the display is turned off.. One of the benefits Google’s smartphones have always offered is an interface that’s cleaner and simpler to use compared to most Android devices. This is no different with the Google Pixel 2XL. That’s largely because Google usually doesn’t include any unnecessary apps and services from wireless carriers. Many phone makers also put their own apps on the phones they sell in addition to Google’s apps and carrier apps (Samsung does this too, although some of its apps may be optional depending on the carrier.) Since the Pixel is Google’s phone, that type of app duplication isn’t a problem. Like the Galaxy S8 and other phones, the Pixel 2 XL also has an always-on screen for checking information at a glance. But Google’s phone offers an extra perk: If a song is playing nearby, the phone can display the title and artist name when the screen is turned off. Of the three phones, I prefer Google’s interface, because it combines the flexibility of Android with the simplicity of an iPhone.. Battery life was generally comparable across all three devices. When using each phone separately, I always had enough juice left after a full workday of sending emails, using social media, and streaming media, among other tasks. I found similar results when testing all three phones alongside one another. After more than six hours of mixed usage that included nearly two hours of streaming video over Wi-Fi and sporadically checking email, refreshing social media, and browsing websites, each phone’s battery level was about the same. The Galaxy S8 and iPhone X were both at 65% while the Google Pixel 2 XL had 75% of its battery left, which isn’t too surprising considering larger phones usually include bigger batteries.. It used to be the case that our smartphones were the best cameras simply because they’re the cameras we have with us at all times. But in recent years, smartphone camera quality has become so advanced that publishers (including TIME) and filmmakers are shooting magazine covers and full movies on iPhones. This year’s major flagship phones from Apple, Google, and Samsung all offer superb camera quality, but there are important ways in which they differ.. In my experience, the cameras on the iPhone X and Google Pixel 2 XL were about equally good, but they excel in different areas. In some test shots, the iPhone X captured better color and detail, particularly for selfies and in photos of outdoor scenery. But the Google Pixel performed better in low-light situations, both with and without the flash turned on. The Galaxy S8’s photos were almost on par with those taken on the iPhone X and Pixel, but it fell short in some areas. When shooting in sunlight outdoors, Samsung’s photos felt slightly washed out compared to those taken on the Pixel 2 XL and iPhone X. I also felt the Galaxy S8’s front-facing camera made my skin look a little too smooth to the point where the photo looked artificial and wasn’t as detailed as the others.. All three phones also offer their own version of what has come to be known as “Portrait Mode,” an effect that slightly blurs the background to make the subject in the foreground more prominent. Apple and Google offer a camera mode that lets you see this effect live as you’re setting up the shot, while Samsung’s phone adds the effect afterwards. Of the three, I thought the iPhone X’s photo had the best mix of sharpness and detail, with the Pixel 2 XL placing in second. The Galaxy S8’s photo wasn’t as detailed and blurred a portion of my subject.. Read more: The Top 10 Gadgets of 2017. Delivering on the basics, like screen quality, camera performance, and battery life, is crucial for any smartphone. But Apple, Samsung, and Google each offer a few special features that are meant to make it much easier to unlock and interact with your phone.. One of the iPhone X’s biggest selling points is the addition of Face ID. Apple’s facial recognition system can be used to unlock your phone without typing in a passcode, to authenticate Apple Pay purchases and app downloads, and within certain apps and services to personalize the experience. Warby Parker’s app, for example, uses Face ID to scan your face in order to suggest pairs of glasses that might look the best on you. Face ID works fine most of the time for these tasks, but I do find myself being prompted for a passcode more often than I would like when unlocking my phone. (The best way to address this issue is to type in your passcode each time rather than resetting Face ID. This helps the system learn your face over time).. Samsung’s phones offer facial recognition, iris scanning, and fingerprint detection for unlocking your phone. In my experience, fingerprint scanning has generally been the most reliable option, and the iris scanning tech usually works more quickly than facial recognition. Even though I prefer fingerprint scanners in general, I often find myself using iris scanning on the Galaxy S8 because the fingerprint sensor is inconveniently located next to the camera and is sometimes difficult to reach.. The Google Pixel 2 XL supports facial and fingerprint recognition, both of which generally provide a fast way to unlock the phone. The fingerprint sensor’s placement in the center of the phone’s rear panel also makes it much easier to reach than with the Galaxy S8, but it doesn’t always read my fingerprint if I don’t keep my finger on the scanner for a long enough time.. Your buying decision will likely boil down to your budget and whether you prefer iPhone or Android. But here are some key takeaways that should help you along:. The good: The Apple iPhone X stands out for its elegant design, excellent screen quality, and the way apps are starting to embrace Face ID to make the experience more tailored to you. But above all else, the iPhone X represents the best form factor of any iPhone to date. Until this point, Apple fans have been forced to choose between a phone that some may find to be too large and unwieldy and a screen that’s smaller than five inches. Now, they can enjoy the benefits of having a larger screen without carrying around a phone that’s much larger than what they’re used to — even if it does mean having to look at a “notch” that sits above the screen. Otherwise, the Phone X hits all of its marks when it comes to battery life, screen, and camera specs.. The bad: The iPhone X’s lack of a home button means there’s a learning curve in using it — you’ll have to get used to changing the way you perform basic tasks like restarting the phone and taking screenshots. There’s also no fingerprint sensor to use as backup if you should find yourself struggling with Face ID. And starting at $999, it’s notably more expensive than the Pixel 2 XL and Galaxy S8.. The good: The Google Pixel 2 XL’s long battery life, exceptional camera, and clean interface make it a top choice. If you often find yourself struggling with photos that are grainy in low light or appear too washed out when taken with the flash, you’ll especially appreciate how the Pixel 2 XL’s camera performs. I also found the battery life to be a bit longer than that of the iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy S8. The interface feels neat and clean compared to some other Android devices. The screen is also larger than that of the iPhone X even though the Pixel 2 XL is cheaper, starting at $849.. The bad : The screen has a blue tint that’s visible when looking at the phone from a side angle, which could be off-putting.. The good : The Galaxy S8’s curved screen is just as functional as it is gorgeous. Because the display disappears into the sides of the phone, the screen feels even more immersive. The Galaxy S8 also includes a headphone jack, which is a rare find on today’s high-end smartphones. The battery life is also comparable to what you would get on the iPhone X, and starting at about $725, it’s less expensive than both the iPhone X and the Google Pixel 2 XL.. The bad: The Galaxy S8’s interface doesn’t feel as simple and intuitive as Google’s, and its camera isn’t as good as that of the iPhone X or Google Pixel 2 XL..

The Pixel 2 is powerful but can't match the XL's style. The Pixel 2 is a brilliantly fast, compact smartphone with a stunning camera.. The Pixel 2 is a brilliantly fast, compact smartphone with a stunning camera.. The Pixel 2 is a brilliantly fast, compact smartphone with a stunning camera.. Chunky edges around screen, dated design. Stereo front-facing speakers, no headphone jack. Geekbench 4 CPU: 1,885 single core, 5,861 multicore. A simple but useful Android 8.0 Oreo interface. The best camera on a smartphone. Battery life isn’t up to par. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. The differences between last year’s Google Pixel and Pixel XL. smartphones revolved around size — the bigger XL model was able to pack a bigger battery, and the larger screen could accommodate a higher resolution. While Google proudly said you get the same features again in the new Pixel 2. and Pixel 2 XL , it’s wrong. Design is very much a feature, and the new Pixels diverge significantly on it. Don’t get us wrong — we crowned the Pixel 2 XL as the best Android phone, and the Pixel 2 shares many of the same merits. In our review, we found that while you get a lot of the same functionality with the Pixel 2, there’s far less style.. In a sea of growing “ bezel-less ” flagship phones, it’s easy to be puzzled when looking at the Pixel 2. It has nearly the same-size edges around the screen as the original Pixel, making the 5-inch display size look small. But the biggest takeaway is how the phone looks dated. Showing it to coworkers, friends, even strangers, they nearly all ignored the Pixel 2 in favor of the Pixel 2 XL, which is bezel-less.. It’s surprising how quickly edge-to-edge designs have made people think phones with bezels look old. Plenty of great new phones haven’t adopt the new design trend, like the HTC U11. and the OnePlus 5 , and even Apple’s iPhone 8. — though Apple has an upcoming excuse called the iPhone X. Google joined the trend with its Pixel 2 XL, but small phone lovers are stuck with a more dated design on the ordinary Pixel 2.. As cool as cutting bezels looks, it also offers tangible benefits. The 5.8-inch iPhone X’s dimensions are just a tad bigger than the 4.7-inch iPhone 8, but you get a display bigger than the 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus. With the Pixel, you’re either stuck with a small phone and a small screen, or a big phone and a big screen.. All that said, we still love the compact size of this phone; nothing on the screen ever feels out of reach. The 5-inch screen has a 1,920 x 1,080-pixel resolution, and unlike the Pixel 2 XL’s POLED panel, the Pixel 2 uses an AMOLED display.. You won’t find the display issues. people have been reporting on the Pixel 2 XL. The screen gets bright enough to read in broad daylight, but it’s not as bright as its bigger brother. Colors and blacks are a little brighter on the Pixel 2, but the screen’s white balance is a tad warmer than the Pixel 2 XL. It’s still a splendid screen with great viewing angles.. Still, after some feedback the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL will be getting a software update that adds a Saturation Mode, in case you want more vibrant colors. The update will also attempt to mitigate any sign of screen burn in, even though the device hasn’t shown any signs of it yet. You can read more in-depth about it here .. We love the compact size of the phone; nothing on the screen ever felt out of reach.. The rear design has the same two-tone mix of glass and metal found on the Pixel 2 XL. The aluminum coating has a matte, chalkboard-like finish that feels comfortable in the hand, and doesn’t attract any fingerprints. You’ll find the fingerprint sensor below the glass near the center, with the camera jutting out slightly on the top left. The glass at the top isn’t just for looks: It houses the antennas, which is why you won’t find ugly antenna bands anywhere.. The power button is on the right edge above the volume rocker. Sadly, there’s no headphone jack, and the only other port is the USB Type-C on the bottom.. We like the rear design, but you’re buying the Pixel 2 for its 5-inch size (and smaller price tag). If you don’t care about the shrinking bezel trend, you’ll be happy with a colorful and bright AMOLED display, and a compact phone you can easily wrap your fingers around.. There is a silver-lining with the Pixel 2. Unlike last year’s phone, Google gave a purpose to the chunky edges: Dual front-facing speakers. We complained that it was easy to block the bottom-firing speaker last year just by holding the phone in a certain orientation. The Pixel 2 sounds great, and gets really loud. Music sounds well-balanced and never tinny.. If you’re lamenting the loss of the headphone jack, there are still plenty of great smartphones out there with the 3.5mm port. If you don’t mind it, you should know the phone supports the latest Bluetooth 5. standard, and a USB Type-C to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter is included in the box.. The Pixel 2 follows its predecessor with unhinged performance thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor inside, with 4GB of RAM. With Google designing the hardware and software, the Pixel phones offer much tighter integration between the two, similar to Apple’s work with iOS and the iPhone.. We saw absolutely zero issues after using the device for more than two weeks. Performance was fluid and fast, with apps launching quickly, smooth scrolling in apps and webpages, and games running without a hitch. We had no trouble playing Transformers: Forged to Fight , a graphically-intense fighting game, and Tiny Archers didn’t put up a struggle.. The benchmark scores don’t suggest the Pixel 2 as the fastest device around, oddly. We saw higher scores on other Android phones such as the LG V30 and the Galaxy Note 8, with the iPhone 8 Plus still reigning king.. Still, the Pixel 2 beat out the Pixel 2 XL’s score — likely due to the processor needing to power a smaller, lower-resolution screen. Despite these overall lower scores, you won’t be disappointed with this phone’s performance. It’s just as good a performer as the other Android flagship phones, if not better.. With the Pixel 2, you get the option of 64GB or 128GB of storage. There’s no MicroSD card slot, but Google offers unlimited, free high-quality Google Photos. From the start up process to the Settings menu, the Pixel 2’s software is clean, simple, and uncluttered. It runs Android 8.0 Oreo, the latest flavor of Google’s mobile operating system. But what’s truly unique about the Pixel series is how you’ll always get version and security updates as soon as they are released. Even if other phones run stock Android, like the Essential Phone , you won’t always get the next version of Android as fast as a Pixel phone.. From the start up process to the Settings menu, the Pixel 2’s software is clean, simple, and uncluttered.. Android 8.0 Oreo is a relatively minor update that introduces a few handy new features such as Notification Dots, like Apple’s unread badges on app icons, and Picture-in-Picture mode, which lets you continue watching a video while in another app. If you want to learn more about what’s new in Oreo, check out our in-depth guide .. Swipe down for the Oreo redesigned notification drawer, swipe up for apps, and swipe to the right to access the well-designed Google feed. You can also press and hold the home screen to add widgets, double tap the screen to wake the phone, and slide your finger up and down the fingerprint sensor to open or close the notification drawer. These are all fairly standard Android functions, so what’s unique on the Pixel 2?. First and foremost, the At A Glance widget at the top of the screen is new — it shows you the date and weather, but if you have a calendar event coming up, it will display it right there. The Google search bar is now below the dock, for easier access. We’re enjoying this placement a lot more than its traditional placement up top, because it makes it easy to tap one handed.. Press and hold the power button, and you’ll see the Power Off and Restart interface looks nicer, similar to the layout of App Shortcuts when you press and hold an app. The Settings menu has been simplified and condensed. If you’re having trouble finding something, the search bar comes in handy.. There aren’t many changes to Google Assistant’s interface. Press and hold the home button and the artificially intelligent robot will pop up for you to ask it search queries, set reminders, send texts, open apps, and more. What’s new is Active Edge, which lets you squeeze the sides of the phone to summon Google Assistant. It’s almost the same exact feature as HTC’s Edge Sense on the HTC U11. It’s handy if you can’t unlock your phone and press the home button, or if you don’t want to say “OK Google” in public. We wish you could use it to customize what you want to open, in case you don’t use Google Assistant, but sadly Google’s a bit restrictive here.. One of our favorite additions is Now Playing. It’s not a feature you use, as it works in the background. Now Playing detects what song is playing wherever you are, and when it identifies it, the name of the song and artist fades into the always-on display. Google said it works offline with a database of popular songs that’s being updated every week, and nothing is ever shared with Google.. It doesn’t always detect the song, especially with songs that aren’t well-known, but it’s nice to see it casually pop up when at a coffee shop or restaurant. Tap on the song name and Assistant will open it, allowing you to check it out in your music app. If you actively want to search for a song, you’re better off using the faster method: Ask Assistant “what’s this song,” and it will identify it. If you don’t care for this feature, or you think it’s taking up too much battery, you can always turn it off in the Settings menu.. The software experience on the Pixel 2 is a joy to use; the interface is fluid, and everything just works.. Google’s first Pixel phone quickly became regarded as one of the best smartphone cameras. It has hit a home run again with its second generation, even if Google didn’t jump on the dual-camera bandwagon.. We like that Google lets you choose a smaller phone without settling for a lesser camera. The Pixel 2 has the same camera as the Pixel 2 XL. The rear 12-megapixel has a f/1.8 aperture, and it’s fast. The camera app opens quickly, there’s virtually no shutter lag, and while it takes a second or two to process the image, the result is usually stunning. You’ll find rich details, and far more accurate color accuracy than last year’s Pixels, which tended to oversaturate photos.. Best of all, this all rings true in nearly all lighting conditions. The included optical image stabilization makes the phone capable of taking great low-light photographs, with incredibly reduced noise.. Google’s Pixel 2 camera leaves the HDR+ mode always on. This mode helps with scenarios where there’s a bright background and a dark foreground, or vice versa. You’ll end up getting a well-exposed photo, where nothing is specifically too bright or too dark. One thing we did find frustrating is how the autofocus never locked onto a subject we tapped on. Move the phone a little and it would change the exposure of the whole photograph.. What used to be “Lens Blur” on the Pixel is now Portrait Mode on the Pixel 2. The function lets you add blur behind a subject, creating a DSLR-like photo. It’s not just a name-change, though. You used to have to tap the shutter icon and raise the phone up over the subject a little so it could gather depth data. Now it’s all done via software, and it’s far simpler to use. Just place a subject in front of you, tap to focus, and click the shutter icon.. The Pixel 2 has the same camera as the Pixel 2 XL.. It’s impressive what the Pixel 2 can do with just software. It accurately identifies the edges around a subject — including hair — and adds the blur accordingly. The blur, or bokeh, isn’t as strong as the iPhone 8 Plus, but it can still make the photo look great. There have been several times when the Pixel 2 inaccurately determined depth and placed the bokeh too much in one place or too little.. But what’s more eyebrow raising is how good Portrait Mode is with the selfie camera. Since it’s all software, Google doesn’t need any specific hardware to be able to capture selfies with this blur-style effect. The results are just as impressive as the rear camera. The image quality looks great and so is the accurate outline of the subject around the blur. If you’re an avid selfie taker, this might be the camera for you.. There’s also two new camera-specific features that are a little more gimmicky. You’ll soon get the option for Augmented Reality Stickers directly in the camera app. You’ll be able to place stickers in your photos and have them interact with other stickers or yourself. The first sticker pack will be filled with characters from Netflix’s “Stranger Things.”. The second somewhat gimmicky feature is Google Lens. Snap a picture, then tap on the lens picture in Google Photos and the Assistant will attempt to identify it. It’s still in beta, and it can only identify landmarks, books, artworks, movie posters, album covers, and video game covers. One of our favorite ways to use it, though, is to have it quickly grab content from a business card. It will detect email addresses and phone numbers, and will ask if you want to send an email, place a call, or add both to a new or existing contact. Google said Lens will continue to evolve, so expect it to get better over time.. We’ve been more than satisfied with our Pixel 2’s camera, and we’ve often found ourselves audibly saying “wow” when looking at some of its results.. It’s not all great for the Pixel 2. Like its bigger brother, you won’t get the best battery life on this smartphone. With moderate to heavy use, we consistently returned home with around 20 percent by 7 p.m. That’s with streaming music, browsing social media and the web, playing videos, taking pictures and video, and more. We would occasionally top up the charge a little during the day, just to make sure it would get through the day. The battery gave us anxiety enough to make sure we had a charger or battery pack with us at all times.. If you’re more of a light user, you’ll be happy with the 2,700mAh battery capacity. We were able to hit 42 percent by 8 p.m. after taking it off the charger at 8 a.m. Leaving the phone in standby also doesn’t drain too much battery: Our Pixel 2 lost 5 percent after leaving it alone from 12 p.m. The benefit of carrying the included charger means you can utilize Google’s fast-charging. We saw the phone earning back 50 percent of its charge from 15 percent in about 45 minutes.. The Google Pixel 2 will set you back $650 from the Google Store, Verizon, and Best Buy. Some colors are out of stock. Verizon’s ads claim the Pixel 2 is “only on Verizon,” but it’s just the only carrier selling the phone. If you buy the phone through Google, it comes unlocked and can work with any major U.S. If you don’t want to pay the whole price upfront, Google, Verizon, and Best Buy offer a monthly payment plan. For example, you can pay $27.04 a month for 24 months for Google’s plan, without interest.. Google Pixel 2 Compared To. Google originally offered a standard limited one year warranty, but the company has now extended it to two years after qualms about the Pixel 2 XL’s screen. Your phone is now protected from manufacturing defects two years from the date of purchase. For added protection, you can tack on Preferred Care for $130 extra and it offers “worry-free protection for your phone for two years,” including two claims for accidental damage. That also includes priority access to specially-trained agents 24/7, access to walk-in centers for screen repairs, and unlimited expert sessions to help you learn to use the phone better.. If the chunky bezels and the lack of a headphone jack don’t put you off, the Pixel 2 is a brilliantly fast smartphone with a stunning camera.. If you want a compact phone that offers similar performance and looks gorgeous, take a look at the Essential Phone , which just got a $200 price cut. At $500, it’s the best looking phone with the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and stock Android. You most likely will not like its camera, which has some issues.. If the Galaxy Note 8. is too big, take a look at the Samsung Galaxy S8. It also offers similar performance, can be found for less than $600, and has a great camera. If you’re not feeling Android, the iPhone 8. is a great alternative, though the iPhone X. The Pixel 2 will likely last you four to five years, maybe more. Google is promising updates for three years after its release.. You may want to put a case on it to protect the front and rear glass, but at least you won’t have a problem with water — the Pixel 2 is IP67 water-resistant, meaning you can take it underwater up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes.. As we mentioned before, the two main deal breakers are likely the lack of a headphone jack and the dated front design. If you don’t care about that, you won’t be disappointed with what the Pixel 2 has to offer.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

Review: Google's Pixel 2 is simple in the best ways. @heatherkelly October 17, 2017: 9:03 AM ET. Nothing about the physical design of Google's new Pixel 2 phones will wow you.. Hands on with Google's Pixel 2 smartphone. Inside, the specifications are pretty standard fare. But the devices are running a lovely, uncluttered version of Android that weaves in the very latest Googley innovations and a handful of inspired tricks.. The Pixel is Google's answer to the iPhone. When the first Pixel-branded phone came out last year, its closest competition (Samsung's Note 7) was yanked off the market for bursting into flames.. The Pixel launch should have been an easy opening, but getting one proved problematic due to limited supplies. Now, the device only makes up less than 1% of the global smartphone market, according to Comscore.. After years of Google's somewhat erratic approach to phone hardware, is the company finally ready to commit?. The new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are Google's flagship smartphones. The smaller Pixel 2 has a 5-inch screen and starts at $649, while the Pixel 2 XL features a 6-inch screen and starts at $849. Both devices are available with 64 GB or 128 GB of storage.. Unlike iPhones, the two Pixels have almost identical features, including the cameras and processors, but the XL does pack a bigger battery. Both phones are waterproof and dust-proof.. Last year, the company rebranded its hardware line as "Made By Google." The Pixel 2 and Pixel XL are technically manufactured by HTC and LG, respectively, but Google says it is completely in charge of the design for the line.. The previous flagship Google phone was the Nexus, which it made in partnership with major manufacturers from 2010 to 2015. The company's other adventures in phone hardware include buying and then selling Motorola, and its modular Project Ara phone, which never made it to market.. Smartphones live or die by their cameras, and the Pixel has added a handful of new features to stay competitive.. Overall, the Pixel's camera takes excellent photos with good dynamic range and warm colors. In low light, the Pixel's images have a bit more noise than iPhone 8 shots. It mimics the iPhone's "Live Photos" feature, making mini 3-second motion clips for each still photo.. It doesn't have dual lens cameras like the higher-end iPhones, but the Pixel is still imitating one of those devices' most popular features. The new Portrait mode fakes a shallow depth-of-field effect, throwing the background out of focus to draw attention to the subject. In our tests, the Pixel wasn't always as effective as an iPhone at separating the subject from the background.. The front camera has a new retouching option that intends to smooth out flaws like wrinkles and acne. In a test, we tried the feature and the results were surprisingly subtle.. At its event announcing the new Pixel phones earlier this month, Google acknowledged that the next big smartphone advancements won't be about the hardware. On the Pixel, most of those smarts are connected to the Google Assistant. Squeeze the body of the device and bam, Google Assistant appears like an eager puppy. (It would be nice to customize this feature, called Active Edge, to trigger something specific like the selfie camera.). It may be doomed to wander this earth without a relatable human name like Alexa or Siri, but Google Assistant is constantly improving. That, and the company's willingness work with developers, gives it an advantage over aging Siri.. One advantage of the Pixel is being the first to test out the latest Google inventions, like Google Lens, the company's image recognition tool. Available only in Google Photos to start, Lens can identify text and objects, like a reverse image search.. And you can't have a phone without a silly emoji update, so the Pixel is adding AR stickers like veggies with eyeballs that dance their way onto your videos. The feature actually won't be available for a few months.. The Pixel is busy, even when it's asleep. It has an always-on screen that shows the time, and its microphones are constantly listening. If you say "OK Google" the phone will spring to life. It will also hear any song playing nearby and name that tune in about 15 seconds.. Perhaps Google is betting that the popularity of smart speakers has made the public less uneasy about a device that constantly listens to them. And Google says the phone isn't recording anything and all the listening and processing is done on the device, using a downloaded music catalog. But some people will, rightly, still have privacy concerns. They can turn it off in Settings.. The physical design of smartphones is almost irrelevant at this point. The biggest differentiators are the location of buttons and sensors, and what color body you'll obscure with a case (the Pixel comes in black, white or blue).. The back is a nice matte aluminum with a glass panel over the sensors — an advantage over the latest all-glass iPhones. The fingerprint sensor is in the same awkward spot on the back. After days of frustrated missed attempts to unlock my phone, I started thinking face detection was a good idea for the very first time.. Phone manufacturers are fighting over who has the thinnest bezel (the frame around the smartphone screen), but they're overestimating how much casual customers will care about a few millimeters of black space. That said, Google has left quite a bit of bezel on the top and bottom of the screen for its (clear and loud) speakers.. The Pixel 2s are higher-end devices, but don't have any specs that will blow other Android phones away. From the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor to the 12.2 megapixel camera, these are all pretty standard.. Unfortunately, one of the newest ideas Google borrowed from Apple is that headphone jacks are passé. Like the recent iPhones, the Pixels include an adapter in case you want to use your old headphones. The single USB Type-C port recreates the same frustrating problems, such as not being able to listen to headphones and charge at the same time.. If you're searching for the best Android smartphone, the Pixel 2 is a solid choice that packs in the best of Google's apps and AI smarts. This year's Galaxy S8 does not catch fire, so there are more options at this level. The Pixel is fun, the best way to use Google software and test early Google experiments, and freed from the annoying junky apps third-party manufacturers or carriers like to pile on.. If you're an iPhone user considering a switch, there's enough to recommend the Pixel 2. But with the iPhone X's release just weeks away, it's worth waiting to see how the devices stack up, especially the cameras.. CNNMoney (San Francisco) First published October 17, 2017: 9:03 AM ET.

Google Pixel 2 XL (128GB, Black & White). CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The Pixel 2 XL perks up the already excellent Pixel 2 with more screen space. It has a fantastic camera, waterproofing and the Google Lens feature that helps you learn more about the world around you.. The Bad The camera's Portrait Mode doesn't work as smoothly as its competitors' dual camera. Its battery doesn't last as long as others in its caliber and the phone has no headphone jack or wireless charging. The displays on some handsets have irksome screen problems.. The Bottom Line A bigger, sharper screen and thinner bezels make the Pixel 2 XL the more desirable Google phone, but some early units have been dogged by screen issues.. What can I do if I'm affected?. Editors' note : This review was originally published Oct. 23 detailing the Pixel 2 XL's screen burn-in issue, on Oct. 25 with further observations and Google's initial remarks, and on Oct. a software fix and extended two-year warranty .. When it comes to the camera, processor and software, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are both identical and fantastic. The differences between the two come down to price (obviously), size, bezel width and screen technology. We loved our early experience with the Pixel 2 XL, but any potential buyers need to know about some problems with its screen that have come to light since we first reviewed the phone, and the upcoming software fix Google says will address it.. Pixel 2 and 2 XL photos: Feast your eyes. The Pixel 2 XL has a bigger 6-inch display and a higher resolution than the 5-inch Pixel 2. But it also uses a different technology, a plastic-OLED (POLED) display, while the Pixel 2 has a more traditional AMOLED screen.. Within the first week of its availability, there have been reports of the Pixel 2 XL display exhibiting screen burn-in , wherein remnants of earlier images remain on the screen, despite not being actively displayed. In two of the five Pixel 2 XLs we have, we saw evidence of screen burn-in.. With our review unit, you can see burn-in with the navigational buttons.. When I displayed a gray color swatch on my review unit, I saw outlines of the notification bar (which includes the time and battery status) and the navigational hotkeys at the bottom of the display. These faint lines still lingered after the display was turned off overnight and after running a screen burn-in fix video, which suggests that this issue is more persistent than image retention (a temporary form of screen burn-in).. Screen burn-in is a known issue that affects various types of displays where images -- like on-screen navigation buttons -- remain in the same spot for an extended period of time. The Nexus 6 , which had an AMOLED screen,. reportedly had similar issues. But it usually happens after some time, and the fact that it's happening on a phone as expensive as the Pixel 2 XL so soon is concerning. We haven't seen burn-in issues in the smaller Pixel 2, the. LG V30 ( $749.99 at Best Buy ). (which also has a POLED display) or the Galaxy S8.. Keep in mind, however, that when we ran the same gray swatch test on three other Pixel 2 XLs, we didn't see any burn-in effects on them -- not yet, anyway.. When I tested to see its effect on YouTube videos, an app that uses the entirety of the phone's display, I generally didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. But I could see ghostly outlines of the hotkeys when I went looking for them. They showed up when a video happened to show light colors at the right side of the screen for more than a few seconds.. Testing the Pixel 2's standout camera. We don't know how many units are affected. Upon investigating the issue, Google announced. 26 that the Pixel 2 XL's burn-in issue was "in line with that of other premium smartphones and should not affect the normal, day-to-day user experience" (despite the fact that, again, we didn't see burn-in on the LG V30 or Galaxy S8). The company promises ongoing software updates starting in the next few weeks that will optimize the phone against burn-in, stating:. We're currently testing a software update that further enhances protections against this issue by adding a new fade-out of the navigation bar buttons at the bottom of the Pixel screen after a short period of inactivity. In addition, we're working with more apps to use a light navigation bar to match their app's color scheme. The update will also reduce the maximum brightness of the Pixel 2 XL by a virtually imperceptible 50 cd/m2 (nits), thereby significantly reducing load on the screen with an almost undetectable change in the observed brightness.. The new saturated color mode mentioned above, the fade-out of icons on the navigation bar, more use of a white as a navigation bar color, and the max brightness curve change will be available as an update to Pixel 2 XL in the next few weeks.. Those who purchased the Pixel 2 XL through the Google Store can return it. within 15 calendar days after they received it. Pixel 2 and 2 XL users specifically are entitled to a two-year warranty worldwide (extended from one year, as of Oct. 26) so long as the phone was purchased through an authorized retailer. (For more information, read about how to return your Pixel 2 XL ).. Note, however, that the Google Store generally has more liberal return policies than other retailers.

In many respects, Google’s first-generation Pixel phones were a really good first try at appealing to the masses. They were simple, fast, and had wonderful cameras. If you could get past the somewhat uninspired design, they were some of the best Android phones released in 2016.. Now Google is back with a follow-up pair of phones, and it definitely spent more time on these. They’re faster, they look unique, and they have Google’s AI built in to help make sure your phone is always one step ahead of you. This is how Google thinks phones should work.. This is our Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL review.. Buy now from the Google Store. About this review: Joshua Vergara has been testing both the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL for 13 days, while I’ve been using the Pixel 2 for seven days. Both devices are running Android 8.0 Oreo with build number OPD1.170816.010 with the September 5, 2017 security patch.. Both devices used in this review were provided to Android Authority by Google.. A month after the initial release of our Google Pixel 2 review (October 2017), more and more problems regarding the Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel 2 XL came to light. Before reading the rest of the review, you might want to read through this section. Here we go over some of the biggest problems reportedly affecting the Pixel 2 family, as well as recent changes Google has made to help address some of these problems.. Since the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL started shipping to its first customers in late October, many of them have reported issues with the phones. Some of the biggest complaints have centered on the display for the larger Pixel 2 XL , with many owners claiming online that they have encountered issues with. Others have reported seeing a blue tint on the Pixel 2 XL screen.. Problems with the Pixel 2 XL and how to fix them. The Pixel 2 XL is meant to showcase everything Google has to offer. The performance is fantastic, the camera is excellent, and the software is what Google wants Android to be. In response to the muted/understated color complaints, Google stated that it has “added an option to boost colors by 10% for a more saturated display.” In an update for the phone that rolled out in early November, Google said it added new options for both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL that added a. âsaturatedâ color mode in its display settings, which users can toggle to make the screen appear more vibrant. Google says that the blue tint “issue” is in fact normal for the phones.. Perhaps a more serious issue that’s been reported with the Pixel 2 XL is that its pOLED screen suffers from burn-in issues ; namely that the phone’s. navigation bar across the bottom of the screen can burn into the display with as little as one week of use. Google has since rolled out an update that will let. the on-screen the navigation buttons fade out, while also âupdatingâ the maximum screen brightness. However, at least one law firm is considering launching a class action lawsuit against Google on the Pixel 2 XL screen issues.. What is screen burn in and how can you prevent it?. If you spend long enough debating the merits of LCD vs OLED display technologies, eventually someone will touch upon the subject of dreaded OLED screen burn in. The point made is that OLED displays will â¦. Some Pixel 2 owners also reported hearing high-pitched and clicking noises from the phone when it’s next to a personâs ear. Turning off the phone’s NFC fuctions served as a workaround for that problem, at least for some owners, and Google’s early November software update apparently fixed this issue for others. Other Pixel 2 owners have reported that the phone’s. However, the fix for this issue is pretty simple; just blow on the microphone .. Finally, the most recent (as of this writing) problem deals with the Pixel 2 XL again, as some users have reported that the screen will occasionally flash when the display is turned on or off , or if it switches automatically. So far, there’s no word on if an update will be released for this issue, although some people think this “bug” is actually sort of cool.. Because of all of these problems with the new Pixel 2 phones, Google has revealed that will offer a free two year warranty worldwide for both devices. This means that people who get the Pixel 2 models in the US will get one extra year under the normal warranty; other markets where the phone is sold already have two years worth of warranty. Preferred Care plan with the Pixel 2 or 2 XL is currently unchanged.. $129 to get their phones replaced in case of accidental damage or device breakdown; that plan lasts for two years as well.. Google has taken the generic design of the 2016 Pixels and refined it.. Google has taken the generic design of the 2016 Pixels and refined it.. Both Pixels feature an aluminum unibody design, but Google says itâs covered them in a âhybrid coatingâ. Some will complain it makes the phones feel more plasticky, but I find it to be a real treat to hold. It does make the phones feel more plasticky than other aluminum phones, but definitely not in a bad way.. Itâs amazing how long a little bit of texture goes with these phones. Comparing the Pixel XL and the Pixel 2 XL, the sizes arenât too different, but the material on the back of the newer phone makes all the difference in terms of handling.. From the back, theyâre nearly identical. The camera sensors are in different places, but, though they stick out ever so slightly, itâs not all that noticeable.. Don’t miss: Google Pixel 2 XL unboxing and first impressions. Surrounding that camera sensor is a glass visorâ basically the Pixelâs trademark at this point. I’m not sure why, but I like the visor on the Pixel 2 much more than on the original Pixels. Maybe I didnât find the fingerprint-sensor-surrounded-in-glass look all that appealing.. Speaking of fingerprint sensors, Google has included a really fast one on the back of the Pixel 2s, and it sits right where your index finger lands when youâre holding it. This is myâ and almost 50% of our readers ââ preferred placement for the fingerprint sensor, and for good reason. It allows you to unlock the phone without smudging the camera , and it makes the front of the phone look cleaner.. I like the design of the Pixel 2 on the back, but the front is a different story.. Overall, I like the design of the Pixel 2 on the back, but the front is a different story. The smaller Pixel 2 doesnât look anything like a 2017 flagship from the front. It’s got big bezels on the top and bottom of the screen. Google included a pair of very loud front-facing stereo speakers on each device, which fill up all that room. They’re the same size on both phones, which explains why the bezels on the Pixel 2 XL are so much smaller.. The bezels also serve another purpose. You can grab onto those babies while playing games and never worry about dropping it.. Reasons notwithstanding, Googleâs decision to make the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL look so different on the front is still perplexing. The Pixel 2 looks like a small Nexus 6P , and the 2 XL (sort of) resembles the LG V30 .. Like the 6P, the Pixel 2 is basically symmetrical, but the Pixel 2 XL isn’t. There is a little bit more to the forehead than the chin, which probably wonât bother most people. It was something we couldnât unsee, though.. Both devices also (finally) have IP67 ratings for dust and water resistance, which means they can withstand submersion in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. Last yearâs Pixels stood out from the flagship competition due to their lack of water resistance. Weâre happy to see Google go the extra mile this time around.. Oh, and if youâre looking to protect your new investment, Google has made some hot cases for these Pixels. The fabric cases are pricey at $40 , but both Josh and I think theyâre totally worth it. They add bulk, but they make an already grippy phone even grippier, and look good doing it. Google has done a great job of making fabric one of the best materials weâve seen and held on a device or, in this instance, a case.. As mentioned, these phones come with very different displays. The Pixel 2 sports a 5.0-inch 1080p OLED display with a respectable pixel density of 441 ppi. It has a traditional 16:9 aspect ratioâ Google calls it âCinematicââ which isnât as eye catching as the Pixel 2 XLâs 18:9 display. Even so, if youâre in the market for a small phone, this one is more than manageable with one hand. The Pixel 2 XL features an LG-made 6.0-inch Quad HD+ pOLED display with a pixel density of 538 ppi. It also has an 18:9 aspect ratio with rounded corners, making the device much easier to manage in hand than last yearâs Pixel XL.. As far as quality is concerned, the Pixel 2âs display, although âonlyâ 1080p, is incredibly bright, crisp, and a joy to stare at day in and day out. Itâs also easy to see in direct sunlight.. The Pixel 2âs display is a joy to stare at day in and day out.. The Pixel 2 XLâs display is a different story, however, as you may have guessed. Reports from all over have claimed that the Pixel 2 XLâs display suffers from muted and undersaturated colors, grainy images when scrolling down web pages, and a blue tint that appears when the phone is tilted to even a moderate angle. In day-to-day use these display issues are barely noticeable, and even when we did see them, it wasn’t all that distracting.. Also read: Why I’m put off by the Pixel 2 XL’s display, but you might not be. Google is aware that some users arenât exactly happy about this, and said if it gets enough feedback, it may add in some more color options to the display settings. Unfortunately, that might not do much. While the saturation can be changed in terms of rendering, the weird viewing angle problems seem to be related to hardware rather than software, making it tougher to fix with a simple update.. In our own display tests, the Pixel 2’s OLED display scored a color temperature of 6969 Kelvin, with the Pixel 2 XL achieving an even cooler score of 7035 Kelvin. This means both displays have a slight blue tint, though they’re warmer than last year’s Pixel XL.. We then tested both displays in standard mode (as opposed to adaptive mode), and the screens dropped down to 6841 and 6891 Kelvin, respectively, which is much closer to the recommended temperature of 6500 Kelvin for color accuracy. Especially compared to the Pixel XL, Google is tuning the Pixel 2 and 2 XL’s displays to produce more accurate colors.. The Pixel 2’s display can also achieve a brightness of 440 nits, while the Pixel 2 XL’s display can go up to 483 nits. Both displays are brighter than the Pixel XL’s. However, last year’s flagship was able to achieve a low brightness of just 2 nits, while the Pixel 2 and 2 XL can only go down to 7 and 5 nits, respectively.. So you won’t have as nice of a time reading on your Pixel 2 in bed as you would with, say, the Galaxy Note 8. What does that mean in the real world? I haven’t had any problems with the minimum display brightness on the Pixel 2, and I don’t think you will either.. The Pixel phones excel in a few key areas, and performance is one of them. Both devices are powered by Qualcommâs Snapdragon 835 Mobile Platform with the Adreno 540 GPU and 4 GB of LPDDR4x RAM. No, theyâre not the first devices to run the Snapdragon 836 like we once believed , but the 835 and 4 GB of RAM is more than enough to keep these phones flying.. Scrolling through the user interface, multitasking, switching between apps, and playing games are all incredibly smooth on both devices. I experienced zero stuttering throughout my time with the Pixel 2. It was surprising how cool the phone stayed, even when playing graphic-intensive games.. Performance is top notch on both handsets.. Multitasking is its own joy, thanks to the updates found in Android Oreo. Picture-in-picture mode is a ton of fun and doesnât bog down the system one bit. YouTube, for instance, defaults to PiP when the home button is pressed, minimizing a small version of the video to the bottom right corner or any place that you might drag it. This is the same with Google Maps, too. In either case, we did not see any decrease in overall performance.. Pixel and Nexus phones of years past have never included expandable storage, and they still don’t. However, Google bumped the base storage amount up from 32 to 64 GB, and thereâs also a 128 GB model if that’s not enough.. Storage shouldnât be an issue for many users though, as both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are able to upload unlimited âoriginal qualityâ photos and videos until the year 2020. That means photo and video storage space is pretty much a non-issue for these phones, which is a huge bonus.. What isnât a huge bonus is the lack of 3.5 mm headphone jack on these devices. Google finally built up enough courage to remove that nasty port that no one ever used anyway. Coincidentally, it’s at the same time as the launch of a pair of smart Bluetooth earbuds. Weâve talked about the headphone jack vs no headphone jack debate here at Android Authority to the point of exhaustion, so Iâll keep this pretty short. Removing the headphone jack is inconvenient for users right now (myself included). I canât help but think itâs nothing more than a cash grab to sell more Bluetooth headphones.. What makes matters worse is that Google doesnât include a pair of earbuds in the box, something pretty much every other OEM is doing nowadays.. Related: The best Bluetooth earbuds you can buy. A headphone jack adapter is included in the box. It’s probably best to just keep it attached to your favorite pair of cans or earbuds so that theyâre constantly at the ready. Or in Joshâs case, have a couple of truly wireless Bluetooth headphones handy and constantly charging.. When it comes to external audio, Google included front-firing speakers on both devices. Hallelujah! They get loud without sacrificing audio quality and are pretty difficult to cover up when youâre playing games or watching videos. From here on out, Iâd rather OEMs include front-facing speakers if it means my phone has a little bezel on the front to compensate.. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are also the first two phones to support eSIM , at least for Project Fi. This means both devices actually have embedded SIMs that never need to physically be removed. Instead, if you need to switch from one carrier to another, the eSIM will allow you to do just that, right from the phone. Well, it will allow that eventually. Itâs still early days for eSIM technology, but in the future switching between carriers will be a breeze.. Under the hood, the Pixel 2 sports a non-removable 2,700 mAh battery, and the Pixel 2 XL has a much larger 3,520 mAh cell. During the announcement I was concerned at the Pixel 2âs battery size, but it hasnât been a huge problem for me during my time with the phone. Iâm consistently getting four hours of screen-on time with the device, though on heavier days I get a little less than that. Itâs not the six hours of SoT that the Pixel XL gets, but itâs decent.. The Pixel 2 XL’s battery life has been consistent and reliable. While four hours of SoT is the norm for the smaller phone, Joshâs XL managed an additional hour. Five hours of screen-on time is practically what the phone strives for, hitting single digit percentages at the end of 12- to 15-hour work days depending on heavy usage. Thanks to the larger capacity, the Pixel 2 XL might be the phone that you want for longevity and constant productivity.. If your battery runs out, charging shouldnât be much of an issue. While they both lack wireless charging, they are compatible with rapid charging as long as youâre using the included 18W charger. Quick Charge 3.0 can be used to get a quick boost or those users who have further adopted the USB Type-C standard can take advantage of capable Power Delivery chargers.. If the first-generation Pixels taught us anything, itâs that the days of laggy camera apps and blurry photos are long gone. Google flexed its camera muscles more so last year than it ever has, and things are even more impressive with the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL.. Some of the biggest news to come out of the Pixel 2 unveiling was the fact that DxOMark gave the devices a score of 98 , which surpasses the iPhone 8 Plus and Galaxy Note 8 by four points. Take those scores how you likeâ there are plenty of reasons not to use DxOMark as your definitive camera ranking system .. The proof is in the picture quality and the reliability of the camera app, and weâre happy to say that shooting with the Pixel 2 has been a blast.. No matter which size Pixel you choose, you get the same camera experience. Both devices come with a single 12.2 MP rear sensor with 1.4 Î¼m pixels and an f/1.8 aperture. Even though dual-camera setups seem to be all the rage in 2017, Google is sticking to its guns and going the single sensor route. You might think that means the Pixels miss out on fun features like Portrait Mode, but youâd be wrong.. Google is using its Dual Pixel cameras to take the place of physical dual camera sensors. Those Dual Pixels take in as much depth data as they possibly can, while the phone bridges the gap in software processing. Portrait Mode shots taken with the Pixel 2 are right up there with the best, though it still has trouble neatly blurring around hair. Weâre eager to spend some time with this mode over the next couple weeks and see how it really compares with the Note 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.. Portrait mode selfie, Pixel 2 XL. Portrait mode selfie, Pixel 2 XL. Portrait mode selfie, Pixel 2 XL. Whatâs perhaps even more impressive is the fact that Google also brought Portrait Mode to the front-facing 8 MP sensor. Naturally, due to the smaller f/2.4 aperture and step down in megapixel count, Portrait Mode shots arenât going to be as nice-looking as the ones taken with the back, but theyâre certainly good enough for sharing on social media. Selfies taken without Portrait Mode are just fine, too. Indeed, without the Portrait Mode even on, the front-facing camera of the Pixel 2 is one of the best performers weâve seen thus far.. Photos taken with the Pixel 2 are stunning.. What if you donât want to shoot in Portrait Mode? Youâre in luck; photos taken with the Pixel 2 are stunning.. Shooting more general photos proved to be a snappy (pun-intended) experience due to the sheer speed of the camera app. Shutter to file speeds are as high as ever, which is impressive considering how the Pixels are essentially taking multiple photos at all times to apply its HDR+. Even in lower-light situations, the camera will not keep the shutter open for long to compensate for exposureâ it just snaps and gets to work. There is a small slowdown in only the darkest situations, but such situations are impractical anyway and require flash.. The Pixel 2 is also the first device to come with Googleâs first SoC, the Pixel Visual Core. This octa-core chipset is designed to assist with photo processing and is said to run HDR+ â5x fasterâ and use âless than 1/10th the energyâ compared to typical application processors.. Itâs worth noting however that neither the Pixel 2 nor Pixel 2 XL are using the chip yet. Google will enable it when the Android 8.1 developer preview arrives in a few weeks.. Google Lens is worth a mention, but keep in mind it isnât available as a shooting mode just yet. For now, it is part of the Photos app as a way to do OCR and backwards photo searches. Weâve had some notable success with this version of Lens, especially when it can read text in a photo and generate a google search query. In other cases, Lens is only recognizing what object is in the frame, giving me âbottleâ as a query instead of trying to read the label on a bottle of wine I recently enjoyed. Lens will likely get better as time goes on and when it finally arrives on Assistant, so we will be reserving judgement until then.. Google is taking an AI-first approach to the Pixel 2, and itâs doing so by putting Google Assistant everywhere you could possibly want. You can still long-press the home button to summon the Assistant, but now thereâs another way to get to it from every screen: by squeezing.. Google is putting Assistant everywhere you could possibly want.. Thatâs right, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL have squeezable sides, similar to what HTC did with its latest flagship, the U11. On the Pixels, the feature is called Active Edge and it does one thing and one thing onlyâ open the Assistant. I wish you could program Active Edge to open any app ( although there is an unofficial way ), but having the Assistant just a squeeze away is actually pretty convenient. I loved using it on my U11, and I love using it on the Pixel.. I find myself using it way more than I did on the U11. The U11 is a rounded, slippery phone, so squeezing it requires a little more effort. The Pixel 2 is a little more angular and grippy.. Now that Google Assistant is available on every Android phone, Iâm not going to walk through every one of its features. But I do want to touch on the fact that itâs the most convenient and easy-to-use voice assistant Iâve ever used.. It does the easy things, like telling me the weather report or how to say âwhere is the bathroom?â in Mandarin. You can type to it if you donât want to talk. Itâs getting better at controlling things on your phone. Itâs getting better and better every week.. Google is also bringing one of its most useful features to the lock screen. The Google app (not Google Assistant, unfortunately) has been able to recognize songs that are playing nearby for some time, but this required you to ask, either by voice or by typing it out, âWhat song is this?â Now you can access that info right from the lock screen without asking.. Once you turn on the new Now Playing feature in the display settings, your Pixel 2 will show the name of the artist and song thatâs currently playing. The disclaimer in the settings menu assures us it never sends songs or conversations to Google.. It works well, but it does have a more limited database of songs to pull from since it’s working offline. However, Google’s database of songs is region specific and receives automatic updates when your phone is connected to Wi-Fi.. Once you unlock your phone for the first time, youâll be greeted by a beautiful new live wallpaper of waves moving back and forth on a beach in Lagos. Itâs part of Googleâs new âLiving universeâ collection of wallpapers that are exclusive to the Pixel 2. There are a total of five Earth view wallpapers, four planet ones, and six âYour whirledâ wallpapers that take local wind data and convert them into colorful moving images. The Earth view wallpapers are the best, though. Check out two of our favorites below.. Also new to the software experience is a redesigned Pixel Launcher, which now sees the Google Search bar move to the bottom of the screen, making it much easier to reach with your thumb. Thereâs also a static At A Glance widget on the home screen that gives you quick access to your upcoming calendar appointments and weather.. And finally ( finally ), Google has removed that âpillâ widget that debuted on the first-generation Pixels. I feel like Iâm the only one that didnât like the look of it. It might have been the reminder that Google Feed (formerly Google Now) is sitting to the left of the home screen, ready to be accessed. But this time around, just be sure to remember itâs there and enjoy the fact that the small pill-like tab is gone. The Pixel 2 Launcher is ultimately cleaner and we are happy with the way it looks and performs.. Itâs no surprise that the Pixel 2 has one of the best Android experiences out there, if not the best.. Google has always excelled in the software department, so itâs no surprise that the Pixel 2 has one of the best Android experiences out there, if not the best. There are just so many little tweaks to the software that really make this experience stand out above all other Android phones. For instance, the Pixel Launcher will switch to an automatic dark theme if you have a dark wallpaper. Also, most Android phonesâ screens are activated when you plug them in or unplug them, but the Pixel 2âs screen stays off. It just adds a little charging icon to the always-on display. Speaking of the always-on display, there is one, though itâs not all that customizable. It shows just the time, date, an alarm icon, and if you have any unread notifications. We would have loved to see some customization in the AoD, like adding graphics and personal images like on the V30 and Note 8. Maybe this will be a feature sometime in the future. For now we have a simple edition of the always-on display to utilize.. What makes the overall experience that much more enjoyable is the new version of Android thatâs running on the Pixel 2. Android 8.0 Oreo is here and, in case you havenât read our full review yet (spoiler alert), itâs wonderful.. See also: Android 8.0 review: Oreo is for everyone. The Oreo experience youâve already seen on last yearâs Pixels is about the same as what you get with the Pixel 2, so again, I won’t go into too much detail here. However, Iâd be remiss not to mention some of my favorite Oreo features on the Pixel 2.. Oh, and one other tidbit before we wrap things up: Google has promised that the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will receive three full years of OS platform updates â not just security patches. That means these devices will see Android P, Android Q, and Android R updates, provided their batteries are able to hold up that long. Thatâs a huge selling point, especially compared to other handsets on the market which only see two years of OS updates.. If youâre thinking about purchasing either device, youâre going to have to shell out a good amount of cash. The Pixel 2 is going for $649 for the 64 GB model, while the 128 GB model is selling for $749 at the Google Store. The Pixel 2 XL is $200 more expensive, putting it at $849 and $949 for the 64 and 128 GB variants, respectively.. If you arenât able to buy these phones outright, the Google Store offers financing options as well as a new trade-in program that could save you almost $400.. Of course, you can also walk into your local Verizon store and pick one up. Verizon is yet again the exclusive carrier partner for the Pixel 2, so odds are the phones wonât make their way to T-Mobile, Sprint, or AT&T any time soon.. Buy now from the Google Store. In case you skipped right to the conclusion, hereâs what you need to know. There arenât a ton of things that separate the Pixel 2 from the Pixel 2 XL, so the model you choose will most likely depend on whether you want a big or small screen. Just know that if you choose the bigger Pixel 2 XL, you may be a tad disappointed by the display. I think it’s totally fine, but you may not.. With every year itâs becoming more and more clear that you donât buy a Pixel for its revolutionary hardware or industry-leading design. You buy the Pixel for the stellar software; for three years of OS updates; for the little tweaks that make using an Android phone truly enjoyable.. You should absolutely buy oneâ you wonât regret it.. In the case of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, Google brought its wonderful software experience to good hardware, which makes for a great pair of Android phones.

REVIEW: Google's new Pixel 2 is the phone you'll want for the long haul. its new Pixel 2 smartphone, Google is playingÂ. which starts at $649 and begins shipping Tuesday,Â. takes most of its cues from its predecessor, the original Pixel. similar and their specs are mostly the same.Â. When the original Pixel arrived a year ago, it solved the biggest headache of using Google's smartphone operating system by offering users an unadulterated version of Android. Instead of larding up the phone withÂ. messy, unnecessary features, as third-party smartphone makers often do, Google got back to basics. The phone combined Google's leading apps and features â Maps, Search, Photos,Â. Pixel 2 does all that still. It's just a little bit better.. I spent about five days with the Pixel 2, the smaller ofÂ. about the Pixel 2 XL, check out my colleague Tony's review ). That wasn't enough time to really put the phone through its paces, and I'll have plenty more thoughts to share in the coming weeks.Â. But I was able to get a good handle on the phone's performance, battery life, camera, and overall design.Â. For the Pixel 2 in particular, not muchÂ. is different from last year's model,Â. The Pixel 2, like the original Pixel, has a 5-inch, AMOLED display, rear fingerprint scanner, squared-off edges, and a single camera lens. While it comes in a new shade of light blue, the Pixel 2 is about asÂ. nondescript as a smartphone can get.Â. That may sound like a put-down, but the fact that Google played it straight with the Pixel 2 is one of the things I like best about it.Â. the borders around screens are shrinking to the infinitesimal, screens seem to go on forever, and everything is made out of glass, Google opted to stick with what worked in the past.. Now, that's not the most forward-thinking approach, and the Pixel 2 won't win any awards for creativity or futuristic design. But most people don't need or likely even want a $1,000 glass phone. They need a sturdy, reliable phone that can withstand being tossed in a bag, dropped on the ground, or doused in water.Â. The phone is fairly lightweight atÂ. 5 ounces, but it feels durable, even with its high-end OLED screen. It has a different feel in the hand than the first-generation Pixel, thanks to a textured, grippy coating on its back. And the Pixel 2 meets the IP67 water resistance standard, which means it can withstand being submerged in about three feet of water for 30 minutes.. It also has sensational battery life. In my tests, the phone lasted nearly two days on a single charge.. or using the camera will drain the Pixel's battery, just like on any other smartphone.. What sets the Pixel 2 apart from the previous Pixel â and Apple's rival iPhone 8 â is its so-called always-on display. shows the time, even when the device is locked and the rest of theÂ. shows the date and symbols for any notifications you have. And even when the phone is locked, it should be able to detect what song is playing in the background andÂ. That always-on feature is a product of the device having anÂ. Unlike traditional LCD displays, such screens can light up individual areas or even pixels while keeping the rest off.Â. After using the phone for five days, I began to consider the always-on feature a must-have. and something I wish I had on my iPhone 6s. While seemingly a minor detail, the feature isÂ. incredibly helpful and, just as importantly, doesn't waste battery life.Â. In addition to offering the always-on feature, the Pixel 2's screen is just plain stunning. It almost make you feel like you're falling into it. Videos are beautiful, photos are crisp and clear, and colors are vibrant.Â. In the future, most smartphone makers will likely moveÂ. to OLED screens and for good reason â they're simply gorgeous.Â. The hallmark feature of the Pixel phones are their cameras. And that's certainly the case with the Pixel 2.. I'll be putting the Pixel's camera through its full pacesÂ. several weeks, but for now, I can safely say that it's easilyÂ. on par with the iPhone 8 and Samsung's Galaxy Note 8.Â. The photos I took with the device were stunning. They're almost impossibly detailed without looking fake or overwrought. Their colors are beautiful and true-to-life. extra controls that make it feel closer to a DSLR.. One great feature is its ability to take portrait photos with blurred backgrounds. It's a capability that's similar to the portrait mode onÂ. the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus. But Apple's phones can only take portrait photos using their rear cameras. The Pixel 2 can take such shot with both its front and rear cameras.. Indeed, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are the only phones currently on the market that can take portrait-mode selfies, although the iPhone X will have the same feature when it arrives in a few weeks.Â. In the photo above, you can see how the Pixel 2's portrait feature can transform an incredibly average selfie with a busy background into aÂ. sharp photo that I'd be unashamed to send to friends orÂ. The technology isn't perfect yet â it cut off several strands of my hair â but its flaws aren't glaring.Â. This selfie portrait mode is easily my favorite feature of the Pixel 2. What makes it even better is that it comes on a phone that's much cheaper than the upcoming iPhone X.Â. And the best part about the Pixel 2's camera is that it's exactly the same as the one in the Pixel 2 XL, which means you don't even have to pay extra to get the bigger phone, like you do with the iPhones 7 and 8 models. Neither of the new Pixel phones relies on a dual-lens camera to work its portrait magic. both phones use just one camera lens and some software to offer the feature.Â. A new hardware feature of the Pixel 2 isÂ. Thanks to a new sensor, the Pixel 2 will automaticallyÂ. Google Assistant, the company's smart assistant feature, when you squeeze its sides. (You can also activate Assistant by saying, "OK Google."). While Active Edge is a neat idea, it was far too sensitive for my liking and a bit awkward to use, in part becauseÂ. its sensor is located slightly lower than whereÂ. my hand naturally gripped the phone. I found myself either enabling Assistant by accident or needing several squeezes to get it to launch.. You can adjust the sensitivity of the sensor in the settings menu. But even after experimenting with different levels, I still haven't found a setting that works quite right for me.Â. That said, I can't figure out a better way toÂ. a voice assistant aside from using a catchphrase. The dedicated button Samsung uses to launch its Bixby assistant seems silly. I'm not a fan of Apple's model, where you have to use the home button to activate Siri. For now, squeezing does seem like the best of those choices.Â. As for Assistant itself, I'm convinced it's the best smart assistant around. It can perform simple tasks in response to commands, such as "take a photo." It can also figure out what to do if you give it a more complex command, such asÂ. "play a makeup tutorial from YouTube." And itÂ. can answer nuanced questions, such as "What are some nearby restaurants that are open on Sunday?". Assistant continues to get smarter and has the brains of Google behind it. is a priority for you, the Pixel phone is the best option on the market.. If there's one major disappointment with the Pixel 2, it's the lack of a headphone jack.Â. Google introduced the first-generation Pixel last year right after Apple unveiled the iPhone 7, which infamously lacked a headphone jack. made a big deal that they didn't follow Apple's footsteps and that the Pixel had the standard jack.Â. reversed course this year and removed the headphone jack from the new phone. With the Pixel 2, you either have to use Bluetooth headphones or use an adapter to connect your wired headphones. Those are crummy alternatives that almost no one likes, and it's disappointing Google followed Apple's path.. And actually, things are worse for Pixel users than iPhone purchasers, becauseÂ. Google doesn't include wired earbuds with its phones. Apple at least includes headphones with its smartphones that can plug directly into their Lightning data ports.Â. particular design choice is one of the few with the Pixel 2 where I think Google missed the mark. Removing the headphone jack is a big and potentially costly inconvenience. It forces people to put up with an awkward dongle â orÂ. spend as much as several hundred dollars to get wireless headphones.. Google has a halfway decent reason for removing the jack â doing so will allow it to make devices with thinner borders around their screens in the future. But in making the move, the company seems to have lost sight of its customers' needs.. A huge selling point of the Pixel 2 and the original Pixel is how seamlessly Google's apps and services are integrated into the phone. If you're entrenched in Google's ecosystem, you'll love this about the new device.Â. If you swipe all the way to the right on the home screen, you'll bring up the Google app, which you can customize for news, alerts, and directions. You'll find a Google search bar on the main home screen. The Pixel 2 will automatically save all the photos you take toÂ. the Google Photos service without you having to lift a finger. And when you use Google's new Lens feature âÂ. a visual search engine that can identify objects in the real world â it will automatically detect email addresses and prompt you to send aÂ. This integration with Google's services is one of theÂ. main reasons to switch to the Pixel 2 from other devices. And Google is eager for switchers, maybe even desperate.. When you set it up, the Pixel 2Â. prods you to transfer over your dataÂ. And Google helpfully included in the phone's box a specialÂ. adapter in the box that allows you to connect the Pixel 2 to Apple's phone to make the process easier. But that same tie to Google's services thatÂ. makes the Pixel 2 great can also be a major roadblock for iPhone users.. Switching to a whole new operating system isn't as simple as attaching a tiny dongle and syncing your photos. For one thing, it can take a lot of work to transfer the data you haveÂ. stored in Apple's iCloud service to Google's comparable service and to the Pixel phone.Â. That's not to say making the switch is impossible, but it's certainly not as easyÂ. as Google's marketing would have you believe.Â. The Pixel 2 isn't a luxury device, and its design isn't going to wow anyone.Â. For current Pixel owners, it's not much of an upgrade. The specs are mostly identical , the overall design has barely changed, and it costs the same as the Pixel didÂ. that are more beautiful and higher-end, so their fans may not see the appeal. And even if they did, they may find it difficult to switch.Â. But I'm a fan of the Pixel 2.Â. It's easy and comfortable to use. the Pixel 2 for years and not wanting or really needing to upgrade.. That's because its a workhorse phone that should hold up for years. Google is selling it for $649, a relatively reasonable price. Its selfie camera is a fantastic feature.. And it has other things to like.Â. It's only a hair bigger than the iPhone 6s. It has noticeable borders around its screen, which I prefer.Â. It still has a fingerprint scanner.Â. All those qualities combine to make the Pixel 2 the best phone for most people. It's ideal for those who need a great phone for work and play but aren't obsessed withÂ. having a super-thin border around their smartphone screen and aren't impressed by "courageous" design choices.. To use an analogy, if the iPhone X is the hot, eye-catching gadget of the moment, the Pixel 2 is the device you want to grow old with.Â. And if you asked me whether I'd encourage family and friends to settle down with the Pixel 2 also, my answer would be a resounding "yes."Â. Get the latest Google stock price here..

I write about technology's biggest companies. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. Pixel - 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.5 mm (5.66 x 2.74 x 0.33 in) and 143 g (5.04 oz).

Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL - Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 octa-core chipset (4x 2.35GHz and 4x 1.9GHz Kryo CPUs), Adreno 540 GPU, 4GB RAM. Pixel, Pixel XL - Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset (2x 2.15 GHz Kryo & 2x 1.6 GHz Kryo CPUs), Adreno 530 GPU, 4GB RAM. Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL have arrived and there are significant differences between them. This isn’t difficult to see with. ’s new smartphones sporting very different designs. By contrast it’s a lot harder to see what Google has improved from the original Pixel to the Pixel 2. Google Pixel 2 (left) vs Google Pixel (right). Designs - Past Meets The Past. Easily the most disappointing thing about the Pixel 2 is its design. Unlike the Pixel 2 XL which shrunk its bezels and jumped on 2017’s hottest smartphone trend (the elongated 18:9 aspect ratio display), the Pixel 2 looks identical to the original Pixel:. Yes, the Pixel 2 is fractionally taller and wider than the Pixel but it is thinner and this results in the two models having exactly the same weight (that’s not a typo). Interestingly it also makes them slightly lighter than the 4.7-inch iPhone 8 (148g/ 5.22 oz ).. But the design is still the problem. Not only does the Pixel 2 keep the large bezels of the Pixel in a bezel-dissolving year, but it compounds this decision by also removing the headphone jack - a move Google mocked Apple for in its advertising for the original Pixel. This will be a deal breaker for some (despite Google’s new ‘ Pixel Buds ’) as will the ongoing absence of wireless charging.. Google's original Pixel and Pixel XL both have a headphone jack. But elsewhere there is good news. The Pixel 2 has a new textured aluminium back which makes it easier to hold one-handed and the large top and bottom bezel space this year is used to fit front firing stereo speakers - a great move and welcome differentiator to rivals (the Pixel 2 XL also has this ).. In addition the Pixel 2 adds IP67 dust and water resistance which was a big omission from the original Pixels and allows full submersion of the phone in up to one metre of water for up to 30 minutes. There’s a party trick too as the Pixel 2 can be squeezed on the sides to prompt the Google Assistant, this will either be genius or pointless depending on how much you use it.. Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL can be squeezed on the sides to open the Google Assistant. Finally alongside black and white options, the Pixel 2 adds a new ‘Slightly Blue’ colour option with a luminous turquoise power button that looks good, though arguably it’s not as striking as ‘Really Blue’ on the original Pixel which has been ditched.. Displays - Same Old, Same Old. As with the design, the Pixel 2’s display will look very familiar:. A few things do stand out here. Firstly the Pixel 2 actually has a slightly worse screen-to-body ratio than the Pixel, but at least that’s due to its new front firing speakers (the Pixel’s bezels were just dead space).. In addition there’s also Gorilla Glass 5 which offers more scratch resistance and a high level of DCI-P3 support for greater colour accuracy and Google didn’t even bother to quote this figure for the original Pixel. The Pixel 2 also supports HDR which is being fast adopted by Netflix, Amazon Video, Google Videos and YouTube, though Google quietly added support for the original Pixel as well last month.. Google'ss Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL offer Always On displays. Lastly the Pixel 2, like the Pixel 2 XL, has the option to toggle an ‘Always on’ display which means the time and notifications can be seen in monochrome at all times. This eats about 1% of battery life per hour and can be switched off if you don’t want it.. Read more - Google Pixel 2 Vs Pixel 2 XL: What's The Difference?. Performance - Android Star, iPhone Dust Eater. Don’t blame Google for this one. The Pixel 2 features Qualcomm’s fastest chipset but in 2017 Apple’s A11 blew everyone else away. That said the Pixel 2 is still a worthy upgrade to the original Pixel:. Snapdragon 835 gains are tangible from the 821 with Qualcomm claiming 27% greater performance and 30% more efficiency. That said the 835 chipset is now six months old, so it would’ve been nice to see Google get an incremental upgrade (836?) as the original Pixels did from the Snapdragon 820 featured in older 2016 Android flagships.. Google's new Pixels are entertainment power houses with front firing stereo speakers. But the Pixel 2’s main strength is the same as the Pixel: stock Android. While it won’t win any synthetic benchmarks in 2017, the original Pixel remains one of the fastest smartphones available for real world usage and I find it outpaces even brand new Snapdragon 835-based models like Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8. The Pixel 2 will build on that.. Separately Google also promises the already superb fingerprint sensor in the Pixel has been upgraded in the Pixel 2 and will be the fastest on the market. In a year where Apple controversially ditched Touch ID on the iPhone X , this could be a big selling point for the Pixel 2.. Cameras - A League Of Its Own. The original Pixel and Pixel XL are remembered primarily for one thing: their incredible cameras. Now Google looks set to leap ahead of its 2017 rivals once again with the Pixel 2 rated as having the best smartphone camera ever tested .. How has this happened? Through both a combination of hardware and software upgrades.. Google promises the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL has class leading smartphone cameras. On the back Google has stuck with a 12 megapixel camera sensor but it has a faster aperture (f/1.8 vs f/2.0) and optical image stabilisation while combining it with the gyroscopic stabilisation and laser autofocus which was so effective on the Pixel. The front camera of the Pixel 2 has also bumped up from 7MP to 8MP.. But the real star is Google’s software. Whereas Apple and Samsung required power hungry dual rear cameras to achieve the popular ‘Portrait Mode’ (focused subject, heavily blurred background) Google merges ‘dual pixel’ technology and its class leading image processing to achieve the same (or possibly better based on early tests) with just one and this also works with the front camera as well for epic selfies.. Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL have Portrait on both front and back cameras. There is a downside compared to dual cameras though, since two modules can offer either a 2x optical zoom (Apple, Samsung) or a super wide angle lens (LG). Neither of these can be done by the Pixel 2, but if it’s simply the best photos and video you want then Google’s phone is a class above the rest.. The Pixel 2 adds ‘Motion Photos’ (a rip-off of Apple’s Live Photos that ripped off Nokia’s Living Images) which creates 3 second short videos around the photos you take to bring them to life. You’ll also still get free unlimited photo and video storage on Google Photos so everything you upload until 2020 will be free for life.. LG G6 (left), Galaxy S8 (centre) Pixel (right) - shows the 2016's phone's camera skills. Finally the Pixel 2’s camera adds Google Lens which allows you to perform searches from the photos you take, and wider support for Augmented Reality (like Apple’s new iPhones) so third parties can integrate real-time 3D modelling into the camera view. This is an area which will explode over the next few years.. Read more - iPhone X Vs iPhone 8 Plus: What’s The Difference?. Battery Life And Charging - Disappointing Stagnation. So the Pixel 2’s camera is the star of the show, but its battery life is not.. While the Pixel has a 2770 mAh battery, the Pixel 2 has shrunk this by 70 mAh. That won’t make a tangible difference (especially when combined with the more efficient Snapdragon 835 and improvements in Android Oreo ), but there’s certainly no revolution in this generation. You should get a day of medium to heavy usage and no more.. As mentioned earlier, the Pixel 2 also lacks wireless charging in a year where even Apple jumped aboard (strange when some old Google Nexus phones supported it years ago), though fast wired charging out the box via USB-PD over USB-C could teach Apple a thing or two.. Neither Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL have wireless charging. Storage and Price - More For No More. While the Pixel 2’s battery life may not have taken a step up, thankfully the same can be said of its price in a year when Apple and Samsung pushed their premium smartphones well over $1,000 .. Thankfully the Pixel 2 still comes in at $649 and $749 like with original Pixel and the lower storage tier has doubled from 32GB to 64GB while 128GB remains at the top. The absence of a 256GB option seems amiss (especially with Google’s long running refusal to support expandable storage in its phones) but the unlimited Google Photos storage does effectively mean limitless capacity.. Google Pixel 2 in Almost Blue cannot hide its large top and bottom bezels but it remains a classy smartphone. On the surface the Pixel 2 looks a disappointing upgrade to the Pixel, especially considering the more exciting changes made to the Pixel 2 XL. But look deeper and Google has addressed almost all the major shortcomings of the original model.. The large bezels remain but they fit front firing speakers. Aluminium and glass remain on the back but with a larger and more grippy aluminium finish. IP67 water resistance is added, the display is more colour accurate with Always-on functionality and the camera once again leaps ahead of the competition making it the number one selling point.. It is also worth pointing out the Pixel 2 is $200 less than the Pixel 2 XL at each storage tier and that’s significant given their displays are the only obvious differential.. So yes the Pixel 2 is a worthy successor and it also compares very favourably with Apple’s iPhone 8 given Google has fitted a superior display (AMOLED vs LCD, 1080p vs 750p), camera, speakers, pricing and battery capacity (Pixel outlasted the iPhone 7 and neither 2017 upgrade has improved). Apple’s A11 chipset is certainly faster, but real world performance is rocket fast on both phones.. So don’t be put off by the Pixel 2’s modest looks. This might just prove to be one of the smartest smartphone buys of the year…. Follow Gordon on Twitter , Facebook and Google+. Google Pixel 2 Vs Pixel 2 XL: What's The Difference?.

They promise the best smartphone cameras on the market, super fast performance, stock Android, and instant updates. But the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL were not created equal, so what’s the difference between them other than size and price?. Here’s everything you need to know…. Google Pixel 2 (left) Vs Google Pixel 2 XL (right). Easily the most immediate and controversial difference between the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL are their designs and displays. The Pixel 2 XL display is larger but more elongated as it shifts to the 18:9 aspect ratio popularised in 2017 by rivals like the Galaxy S8, LG V30 and iPhone X. The Pixel 2 XL also has a higher 2K resolution, full coverage of the RGB spectrum for more accurate colour reproduction and a P-OLED vs AMOLED panel.. The difference between P-OLED and AMOLED is minor and refers to the use of a plastic substrate in the former, even though companies often use this in the latter (Samsung). Consequently it is largely down to marketing with as HTC (which built the Pixel 2) using AMOLED and LG (which built the Pixel 2 XL) using the term P-OLED. Don’t sweat it, the Pixel 2 XL’s advantages are down to it being a more expensive device rather than inherent advantages of its panel type.. Google's Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL offer Always On displays. Elsewhere both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL support HDR which is fast being adopted by Netflix, Amazon Video and Google Video, while they also add support for an always-on display (popularised by Samsung) - an option to always see the time and notifications in monochrome when the phones are in standby.. Of course the other big difference between the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL displays is their screen-to-body ratio and that brings us to design:. As both its name and display size implies, the Pixel 2 XL is significantly larger than the Pixel 2 but it also has a much more modern design. While the Pixel 2 disappointingly retains the large top and bottom bezels of the original Pixel, the Pixel 2 XL cuts them away though notably not by as much as the Galaxy S8 (83.6%), LG V30 (81.2%) and iPhone X (82.9%). Google Pixel 2 in Almost Blue cannot hide its large top and bottom bezels. The compensation for the bezels that do remain on both is the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL feature front firing stereo speakers, a real differentiator from the competition and a welcome return for a feature missed from the original Pixels after proving popular on the Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P.. The new Pixels also stand out by retaining their distinctive split aluminium and glass backs. With Apple’s new iPhones and Samsung’s new Galaxies featuring fully glass backs, there’s more durability here (plus the catch-up addition of IP67 dust and water resistance) and the Pixels’ aluminium is textured so they are less slippery in hand.. There is one downside to this (more in the Battery Life section), but there’s no denying the two tone finish means Google has created something distinct. Especially when combined with some nice colour options like ‘Slightly Blue’ (Pixel 2) and ‘Black and White’ (Pixel 2 XL), dubbed ‘Panda’, which feature bright, funky power buttons.. Pixel 2 XL 'black and white' edition with its distinctive power button. More sheep than trendsetter, however, is Google’s decision to join Apple and remove the headphone jack from both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. Google has launched AirPod rivalling ‘ Pixel Buds ’ as a wireless alternative and will include a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter in the box, but it’s a disappointing move nevertheless. Especially after Google crowed about the jack’s inclusion on the original Pixels just after Apple ditched it.. 2017 was the year Apple’s A11 chipset blew the competition away , but the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL do feature the same class leading Qualcomm chipset as the premium Android competition:. On paper there are solid gains against the 2016 Snapdragon 820 (30% more efficient, 27% faster) but the 835 chip is now six months old. As such what Google is really promoting is the greater software efficiency the new Pixels can offer compared to Android rivals.. Google's new Pixels are entertainment power houses with front firing stereo speakers. The key here is stock Android. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL join the Pixel, Pixel XL and Nexus 6P as the only smartphones currently supporting clean, unmodified Android with no third party bloatware and access to updates as soon as Google releases them (rivals can wait six months or more, though. Project Treble may change that ).. Stock Android can make a huge difference in real world use with hardware benchmarking failing to represent just how fast and smooth the original Pixel and Pixel XL operate. In fact one year on I’d still say my Pixel XL daily driver is faster in real world usage than any 2017 Android flagship I have used.. And yet Google is also learning from its Android partners. Having taken the Always on Display from Samsung, Google has also adopted the squeezable sides of the HTC U11. These are pressure adjustable and a squeeze will launch the Android Assistant from anywhere, including the lockscreen. Will it catch on? Time will tell, but. I can't think of a faster way of bringing it up on any other phone. the squeeze re-mappable as well and Google could be onto a winner.. Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL can be squeezed on the sides to open the Google Assistant. While real world speed was one of the Pixel and Pixel XL’s standout features in 2016, by far the biggest selling point was their cameras which were the best (and arguably still are) of any smartphone since. Now Google promises the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will take things up another notch, even if this isn’t obvious from the specs:. The big standout here? Google has stuck with a single rear camera despite 2017 being the year Apple, Huawei, LG and Samsung went big on dual cameras.. Google promises the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL has the class leading smartphone cameras. On the one hand this is disappointing because dual cameras deliver features single cameras simply can’t provide like x2 optical zoom (Apple, Samsung) or a super wide field of vision (LG). On the other hand, DxOMark just rated the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL as having the best overall photography and video of any smartphone on the market by a significant margin .. How? It all comes down to software which is now the biggest factor in smartphone photography and Google’s image processing algorithms and machine learning are unmatched. These software skills also mean Google can throw in tricks like Portrait Mode (which heavily blurs the background to create a DSLR-style image) on both the front and rear cameras despite it usually being restricted to dual cameras.. Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL have Portrait on both front and back cameras. Google has also added ‘Motion Photos’ (a rip-off of Apple’s Live Photos, that ripped off Nokia’s Living Images) which intelligently detect movement to automatically create 3-5 second videos with each image. Will that waste storage? No, Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL owners will get free, full resolution unlimited Google Photos storage like the original Pixels. This lasts until 2020 after which, if you haven’t bought a new Pixel, you will only be charged for new full resolution images you add (your old stuff is safe).. And Google’s camera push doesn’t end there. Initially exclusive to the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL is Google Lens which brings Google search to images taken by the camera. There is also support for Augmented Reality with owners able to integrate third party 3D modelling into the camera view. Expect this to lead to a flurry of AR apps, just like Apple is pushing with iOS 11.. Battery Life And Charging - Incremental Updates. Google hinted at better battery life ahead of the launch, but in reality the new Pixels only see minor alterations with the Pixel 2 actually having a slightly smaller battery than its predecessor:. The flip side is the extra efficiency of the Snapdragon 835 chipset combined with the notable battery life improvements in Android Oreo should see gains compared to the original Pixels, which were already long lasting phones. There's also fast wired charging up to 18W out the box using USB-C ( that's how it's done Apple ). Expect the Pixel 2 XL to. come out on top like last year.. Neither Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL have wireless charging. Then again the downside to those grippy, textured aluminium backs mean there’s no wireless charging in either the Pixel 2 or the Pixel 2 XL. This is a shame given Apple’s push to join Samsung and make the Qi wireless charging standard ubiquitous in 2017 and I expect many shops, cafes, planes and trains will add Qi charging over the next few years.. Personally I’m not a huge wireless charging fan (every time you pick your phone up it stops charging), but I think its omission could be a deal breaker for some.. Storage and Price - Increases Everywhere. While 2017 has witnessed some superb smartphones, it has also seen the price of premium models rise dramatically - notably from Apple and Samsung which burst through the $999 barrier.. Google doesn’t go quite that far having retained the Pixel’s pricing for the Pixel 2 and double base storage for good measure, but the Pixel 2 XL costs $80 more now at both its storage tiers:. While it’s good to see 32GB models bite the dust (a trend in flagship smartphones this year), the lack of a 256GB option means the 128GB Pixel 2 XL costs as much as a 256GB iPhone 8 Plus and that’s not a great way for Google to win customers from Apple.. Like Apple, Google also doesn’t fit its smartphones with expandable microSD storage (never has) so you need to buy what you need upfront and that gives LG and Samsung an edge. What does work in Google’s favour is the free unlimited Google Photos storage which effectively gives both Pixels unlimited storage, but how effectively this can be communicated to the general public is unknown.. Google Pixel 2 (left) Vs Google Pixel 2 XL (right) - show their distinctive aluminium and glass backs. Google promises there’s no compromise between its Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones, but that’s not really true. Yes the core features like performance and (crucially) camera align, but their designs, displays and battery capacities do not.. The Pixel 2 XL is clearly the superior phone and that’s reflected in its price. But for those who can look past the Pixel 2’s big bezels, you’ll get the same lightning quick performance, class leading camera, stock Android experience and ‘unlimited’ storage as the Pixel 2 XL for $200 less.. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL represent Google’s vision for Android: do the basics better than everyone else. They are also clearly the best marriage of hardware and software you’ll find anywhere on the Android platform and their cameras will prove the biggest selling point.. As such the biggest question will be: can Google keep them in stock?. Follow Gordon on Twitter , Facebook and Google+. Google 'Confirms' Pixel 2 Release Date.

more ... more .... more ... more .... View all photos (39). Based on 4 User reviews. Lots of RAM (4 GB RAM). Large camera sensor pixel size (1.4 μm). Lacks microSD slot for storage expansion. The Pixel 2 follows the model set by last year's first-gen Pixel, combining top-notch specs with Google's software expertise. Powered by the latest Android 8.0 Oreo (with no bloat whatsoever), the phone offers a set of promising stereo speakers, a 5-inch OLED screen, water resistance and a rear-positioned fingerprint scanner. Its highlight, however, is the 12MP camera. While it is no slower than any other high-end camera, this shooter uses multiple frame processing to create photos with better dynamics range. Portrait mode is also on board. One thing that is missing, however, is a 3.5mm audio jack.. Google Pixel 2 Review Google Pixel 2 benchmarks.

What is the Google Pixel 2 XL?. Google Pixel 2 XL – Design. Google Pixel 2 XL – Screen. Despite being surrounded by controversy since its release in November 2017, the Pixel 2 XL remains my favourite Android phone on the market right now. This is true even when considering its issues with the display, speaker, and some units shipping without an operating system onboard.. To Google’s credit, numerous patches have been pushed out to fix the majority of concerns, notably for the display. The LG OLED panel came in for much criticism, and I agree that it wasn’t very good. However, a new vivid colour mode addresses some of the issues.. Related; MWC 2017 news and releases. The blue-shift when you tilt off-axis is still there, and will remain, but this is only really noticeable when you’re looking for it. I’m fine with the screen, simply because the phone impresses so much elsewhere.. The camera is the best there is, capturing fantastic pictures in varying conditions. There isn’t another phone around that takes consistently superb shots, and Google’s picture processing remains the best. Nifty extras such as slick Star Wars AR stickers only add to the overall experience.. The software is a high point, too, as it always is on phones made by Google. Not only is it one of only a few handsets rocking Oreo, but you’ll be first in line for whatever Android P turns out to be later in the year. There are no ugly skins, dodgy icons or useless features here; just Android in the way Google intended it.. Battery life is holding steady at just over a day and a half, but the lack of wireless charging is more irritating now that it’s becoming more popular. Still, at least Google includes a fast charger in the box; this does an excellent job to quickly juice up the phone.. The Pixel 2 XL remains an excellent choice – and it has only improved since release..

For the second year running, the larger of the two Pixel devices released by Google is the more enticing, but it’s not without its faults.. While the Pixel 2 sticks to a familiar blueprint, the Pixel 2 XL takes mimics the Samsung Galaxy S8 , iPhone X and LG V30 by slimming down the bezel and extending the display.. Google has crafted a fantastic phone with a stunning camera, but there’s still work to be done – especially will the slightly dodgy OLED display..

For a long time, smartphones were rectangular slabs of metal with a big bezel running around the display and a prominent chin and forehead. All this changed when Samsung unleashed the Galaxy S8 , which saw the slimming of that bezel right down and a screen that stretched edge-to-edge.. The Google Pixel 2 XL doesn’t really fit into either category. I’m sure some will claim that it features a bezel-less display – but in reality, it doesn’t. Like the LG V30 and Galaxy S8, the Pixel 2 XL has an 18:9 display with rounded corners – but unlike those devices, there’s still a prominent bezel around its sides. This makes the Pixel 2 XL feel big, and more comparable to the Galaxy Note 8 in terms of size.. At least the bezel serves a purpose in the Pixel 2 XL. Above and below the display sit decent-sounding, front-firing stereo speakers, plus Google has added pressure-sensitive edges that will invoke the Assistant with a squeeze of the sides.. Opting to make a bigger handset requires deeper thought with regards to the design considerations elsewhere. Samsung, LG and Huawei have all started to heavily curve the rear of their devices, helping them feel more comfortable in the hand. Google has done the same, but not to the same extent. As a result, the Pixel 2 XL feels more difficult to hold.. The back of the Pixel 2 XL is a mixture of glass and aluminium, although the glass features only sparingly in a shade covering the camera and flash. The aluminium is covered in a coating that gives a chalkboard-like feel; resistive, grippier and slightly textured. It’s an excellent finish that goes some way to add the grip lost by the Pixel 2 XL’s lack of curves. I only question how this coating will wear over time…. My review unit is the all-black model, but I prefer the Stormtrooper-esque black and white variant. It even has a small pop of colour in the form of an orange power key. This extra hit of colour adds a fun element to the phone.. Like most flagship handsets worth their price tags this year, the Pixel 2 XL is IP67-rated for water-resistance. This means you can submerge the phone in 1m of water for about half an hour without any resulting damage.. In the Pixel 2 XL, Google has also followed the trend to remove the headphone jack. I can only assume it was for waterproofing purposes – which is a shame, given that the company made such a point of keeping it last time around. There’s a USB-C to 3.5mm port dongle in the box and there are plenty of ‘Made for Google’ USB-C headphones coming soon – but it remains annoying.. At 6 inches, the screen on the Pixel 2 XL is the biggest seen on a Google-branded handset since the Nexus 6. The display on that phone was one of its weaker features, and it’s a similar story here.. But it simply isn’t in the same league as the panels manufactured by Samsung and used in its own flagships.. Instead of using one of the fantastic Super AMOLED panels from Samsung, Google has opted for a plastic OLED, or P-OLED, from LG. LG isn’t as experienced as Samsung when it comes to building smartphone displays, and it shows.. In terms of colours, the screen lacks punch and whites are often tinged blue. If you’re looking at a website that’s primarily white, the colour isn’t uniform and is frequently streaked with grey. It’s also a very cool display, meaning you’ll feel it in your eyes when you’ve been staring at it for long periods. This is made worse by the fact that Google doesn’t offer any way to alter the temperature of the screen, so you’re stuck with how it comes out of the box. Viewing angles are also quite poor. Tilt the phone to either side and ugly banding will appear, altering the colours.. It isn’t all bad news, however. With a quad-HD+ resolution, there’s plenty of detail and movies look great. This screen isn’t being touted as an HDR display, but Google has worked some software trickery to allow it to playback HDR-enabled clips from YouTube – and the extra contrast looks fantastic..
