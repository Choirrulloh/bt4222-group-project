more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 16 GB + MicroSD. Available: AT&T , U.S. Does not support automatic screen brightness. Too little RAM memory (1.5 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (294 ppi). The Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) comes with a 5-inch display carrying a 720 x 1280 HD resolution. The Exynos 7 Quad 7570 chipset is under the hood, featuring a quad-core 1.4GHz CPU and the Mali-T720 GPU. 1.5GB of RAM is inside along with 16GB of expandable internal storage. A 5MP camera graces the back of the handset, and a 2MP selfie shooter can be found on the front of the unit. Keeping the lights on is a 2600mAh battery, and Android 7.0 is pre-installed.. Dimensions: 5.55 x 2.76 x 0.34 inches (141 x 70.1 x 8.6 mm). Weight: 5.22 oz (148 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, Panorama, Effects. Quad-core, 1400 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 14 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 23.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 17.0 days (408 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 12.

The Good Samsung’s Galaxy J3 for 2017 has a low price, a removable battery and 256GB external storage.. The Bad The J3 lags hard with less RAM than last year’s model. Cameras are low-resolution compared to budget rivals.. The Bottom Line This year’s Galaxy J3 is a lukewarm rehash of last year’s great budget phone. Go for the Moto E4 instead.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. It gives me no pleasure to say this: Samsung could have done better with this year's refresh of the Galaxy J3, and so can you.. Things you should expect from a super budget phone: it runs the current version of Android, takes pictures good enough for Facebook and gets through the day on a single charge. In those respects, the affordable Samsung Galaxy J3 for 2017 does fine.. Compared to last year's J3, this update runs Android 7.0 Nougat, and doubles the upper limit of your microSD card (from 128GB to 256GB here). The processor also gets a slight boost. But Samsung doesn't go far enough to make 2017's J3 feel and act like a different, better phone.. In some ways, it's actually worse. The new Galaxy J3 is frustratingly sluggish, even when navigating around. Its battery doesn't last as long as last year's model (just about 14 hours, versus 15 and a half). And there's actually less RAM than 2016's J3 (1.5GB versus 2GB).. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News. Homeland Security's tall order: A hacker-free election. 'Annihilation' director wove memory into a dream-like movie.

Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) review: Worthy of more attention. Samsung Galaxy J7 review: Surprisingly good. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) review: The flagship pretender. The Samsung Galaxy J3 is one of the most popular smartphones in the Samsung range, not least because of its affordable price. The 2017 edition was therefore eagerly awaited by many users, as the South Korean manufacturer has decided to strengthen its technical data sheet a little more than usual. Galaxy J3 (2017) worth? We find out in our full review.. Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) release date and price. The Galaxy J3 (2017) was made official last June by Samsung and you can. This is the dual-SIM version with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage (expandable by microSD card up to 256 GB). Three colours are available: black, light blue and gold. Finally, you should know that the phone is of course compatible with 4G.. Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) design and build quality. The Galaxy J3 (2017) is very easy to handle with one hand. Unlike the J5 (2017) and J7 (2017), the smartphone is not fully metallic. Honor 6X review : dual cameras for just $250. The Galaxy J3 supports two SIM cards and a microSD card. At this price range, we don't expect. a particularly bold or stunning design. This Galaxy J3 (2017) is no exception to this rule. original, the Galaxy J3 (2017) is a classic, ergonomically pleasing. This is due on the one hand to the compact size of the camera and on the other hand to the rounded corners, which make it easy to handle.. Personally, I used it mainly with one hand and I never had any trouble using all the buttons with my index finger or thumb. volume buttons are well-located on the left edge, as is the standby button on the right side.. Compared to last year, the dimensions were slightly increased from 142.3 x 71 x 7.9 mm to 143.2 x 70.3 x 8.2 mm.. The phone also puts on a bit of weight, coming in at. 142 grams on the scale (compared to 138 grams for the J3 (2016)).. Unlike the Galaxy J5 (2017) or Galaxy J7 (2017) , the smartphone is not entirely made of metal. Only the central rear part is made of this metal and the chassis is made of plastic. The top and bottom edges at the rear are also plastic with separation lines for the antennas that form an attractive. As for the rest, it's classic. a central button at the bottom of the front panel, which unfortunately doesn't act as a fingerprint reader. Some competitors such as Honor or Alcatel, however, offer this functionality in smartphones sold at the same prices.. The Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) features a 5-inch (279 dpi) high definition (720p) display. Samsung didn't do anything crazy, no surprises there. They could have opted for Full-HD, but that would probably have done more harm than good to the smartphone.. However, unlike last year's model or its big brothers in the J range, it is not an AMOLED screen but a PLS TFT LCD screen (a cousin of the IPS). This results in a loss of contrast and brightness. also worse than last year's model. Overall, it is a little disappointing to see the 2017 version of the J3 regress in some ways.. Thankfully, the touch screen works without any problems and the rendering remains clear and precise. Whether in full sunlight or in the shade, the Galaxy J3 (2017) has also responded perfectly to changes in the weather while remaining legible.. Android Nougat 7.0 is the default OS for the Galaxy J3 (2017). the new J3 still comes with Nougat. But it's a good bet that the smartphone will receive the update next year, if we consider that the J3 (2016), released with Marshmallow, got Nougat.. Pending an update, the Galaxy J3 (2017) ships with. Android 7.0 Nougat, Samsung Experience (the new name for TouchWiz) version 8.1, and the August security patch.. Samsung users won't find any surprises when it comes to the interface. Either you like it or not. This includes Samsung's blue interface and all its preinstalled Samsung apps for music, videos, news, Microsoft apps, social networks (such as Facebook) and Google apps. Bad point, most pre-installed applications can only be disabled.. With 16 GB of internal memory (10 GB free for user storage), we strongly recommend to invest in a microSD card to avoid suffering any annoying slowdowns. When the memory is not full, the interface is more fluid, applications open (relatively) quickly. I did not notice any particular bugs during my test.. Of course, if you are putting. the Galaxy J3 (2017) through seriously intense use, or doing a lot of multi-tasking, you'll likely. Considering the price, this is only to be expected.. Last but not least, this phone is also equipped with the Game Launcher, just like the Samsung's A, S and Note Series devices.. Now that cheap smartphones can do everything, what's the point of flagships?. 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 3.1. 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 3.0. 3D Mark Ice Storm Unlimited ES 2.0. In the bowels of the Galaxy J3 (2017), one finds a fairly modest in-house processor, the Exynos 7570. This is a 1.4 GHz quad-core processor with 2GB of RAM.. On the storage side, it's the bare minimum with 16 GB of internal storage, fortunately expandable by microSD card up to 256 GB. In most cases, the J3 (2017) is fast enough to ensure a smooth daily routine even if it doesn't wow.. On the graphics side, we find the fairly old Mali-T720 graphics chip. So forget about games that are too energy-intensive , otherwise you will experience rather unpleasant slowdowns and janky frames. Asphalt 8 , for example, is quite disappointing on this type of device. You can get a more theoretical idea by observing the result on the benchmarks below. Galaxy J3 (2017) does not particularly shine compared to the competition.. When it comes to SAR, the Galaxy J3 (2017) is reasonable with 0.658 W/kg at the head. and 1.32 W/kg at the body.. Best Bluetooth headsets for your Android phone. The speaker of the Galaxy J3 (2017) is located in a rather impractical place / © AndroidPIT. The Galaxy J3 (2017) just about does the job, but that's it. It has a single loudspeaker that manages fairly well. Its positioning on the right side of the device is nevertheless awkward because it is not very ergonomic, especially if you are playing a game or watching a video in landscape mode. Fortunately, for calls, it is more than enough.. The same is true for the audio output, which is within the average range. The headphones included in the box can be used. but will not ensure the best possible audio quality.. For calls, the voice is clear even in noisy environments. The sound on the receiving end is also adequate.. Like the J7 (2017), the camera has a 13 megapixel sensor, but it's not the same. The front camera is somewhat disappointing. The application of the Galaxy J3 camera (2017) is without surprises and easy to use. Gallery of photos taken with the Samsung Galaxy. The Galaxy J3 (2017) features a 13 megapixel main sensor at the rear with f/1.9 aperture, autofocus and LED flash. At the front, it features a 5 megapixel sensor with f/2.2 aperture and LED flash. This is a fairly standard configuration for a device in this price category.. In practice, the J3 (2017) is quite average. It's not the worst in the price range, but it's not the best. is the main criterion for you,. A Moto G4 Plus or a Huawei P8 Lite 2017. have the advantage in this regard.. In terms of quality, when the light conditions are good, the camera on the Galaxy J3 (2017) is doing quite well. There is a lack of detail and the backgrounds are often quite bland. The development is also a bit slow but the reactivity is decent and it is possible to take a series of shots on the fly without any problems.. In low light conditions, it is a little more problematic because the Galaxy J3 (2017) sensor is not able to capture enough light. As a result, there is a lot of noise on the shots and pictures are often blurred.. The front camera also gives fairly average results. if you want to use the flash, as it tends to. Finally, on the video side, it is possible to film in Full-HD. The result is good and I find the quality of the videos better than the photos.. Overall, the J3 (2017) is a bit disappointing, camera-wise. You can get an idea for yourself by looking at our pictures below:. No USB Type-C port but it has a mini jack. Battery life is clearly one of the most significant aspects of this Galaxy J3 (2017), if not the best. Under the hood, the J3 (2017) has an integrated 2400 mAh battery pack that is sufficient to power the 5-inch HD screen. On the PC Mark Battery test, the Galaxy J3 (2017) lasted 12 hours and 33 minutes.. It's a little worse than last year, but the smartphone is able to provide a day of. If you are not too greedy, it will even be possible to stretch it a little longer and spend two days without reaching for the recharge box. In the settings, you can activate two energy-saving modes to improve your battery life.. Unsurprisingly, the J3 (2017) does not offer a fast charging system. or even a Type-C USB port.. The J3 (2017) will justly be criticized for not being able to replace the battery, which was. a great advantage of its predecessor .. Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) technical specifications. 143.2 x 70.3 x 8.2 mm. 1280 x 720 pixels (294 ppi). HSPA, LTE, NFC, Dual-SIM , Bluetooth 4.2. Its classic design, the reputation of its manufacturer and the fluidity of its interface explain the reasons for the success of this smartphone.. The Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) is a good Android smartphone that will suit users looking for a versatile, reliable and affordable smartphone. Although it does not really stand out in any particular field except for battery life, the J3 (2017) does the job it's made for. Its classic design, the reputation of its manufacturer and the fluidity of its interface explain the reasons for the commercial success of this smartphone. We would simply have hoped for some more improvements over. last year's model and some innovations, such as a fingerprint reader.. Anyway, if you're looking for a cheap smartphone, this Galaxy J3 (2017) may be right for you. Just know that the alternatives are now numerous in this price range ( Moto G4 , Honor 6X, Wiko View...) and sometimes offer more than the J3 (2017), despite the Samsung brand name..

Samsung Galaxy J3 2017 Smartphone Review. Florian Wimmer ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 08/07/2017. Android ARM Touchscreen Smartphone. Samsung also has a 5-inch smartphone from the lower mid-range in its portfolio with the Galaxy J3 (2017) Duos. The models from last year's lineup were real top sellers and many of our readers showed interest. Thus, we are curious whether Samsung can meet the high expectations this year again..

All the hype around Samsung's successful high-end devices easily lets us forget that the manufacturer is also very successful in the mid-range. The Galaxy A series is a kind of mini offspring of the Galaxy S smartphones, while the Galaxy J devices are more autonomous and situated in the mid-range below the Galaxy A phones. Like in the A series, there are different sizes and configurations. The three models of the Galaxy J series are called. Galaxy J5 , and Galaxy J3. The latter is the center of attention in this test. Since there have been several iterations of the J phones, Samsung has added the year (2017) to this year's smartphones. Samsung only sells this year's smartphones as dual-SIM models as the name affix "Duos" indicates.. The Galaxy J3 (2017) Duos is a 5-inch smartphone that comes with the usual configuration features for the 200 Euro (~$190) price range. We are curious to find out where the differences to the bigger. are and how similarly priced devices, such as the. Lenovo Moto G5 , score in comparison. And it would of course be interesting to see how our review sample fares compared with last year's. Can Samsung continue its prior success?. Samsung Exynos 7570 Quad ARM Mali-T720 MP2.

The Galaxy J3 (2017) also follows the current Galaxy design language with rounded, organic shapes, its big, separated home button and pastel colors. Galaxy J3 , the design is more homogeneous and makes a more balanced impression. Available colors are black, gold, and a bright metallic blue like that of our review sample. All three colors are quite restrained and the Galaxy J3 is thus not really an eye-catcher. Instead, it impresses with an impeccable build and its entirely glass-covered front with elegantly rounded edges toward the rear. The casing is only sensitive when high pressure is applied to the screen. The device cannot be warped in any way.. The battery cannot be replaced, thus the predecessor holds a big advantage over the 2017 model. Instead, the rear is non-removable, and the SIM and micro-SD cards are inserted via tray on the device's sides.. Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) full resolution. Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) full resolution.

Buyers who are willing to spend a bit more can sometimes find 32 GB of storage, as in Sony's Xperia XA1 , or 3 GB of RAM like in the Moto G5. Our review sample supports two SIM cards simultaneously and still allows inserting a micro-SD card. The micro-SD card cannot be formatted as internal storage, but apps can be moved to the external storage device.. A conventional micro-USB port is situated on the lower edge.

The Galaxy J3 (2017) Duos is shipped with the Android 7.0 operating system. The security patches were dated 1st June 2017, which was already over two months old at test time.. Samsung does not deliver its smartphones with a pure Android. It installs its own user interface called Samsung Experience. Although it is not much different from stock Android, it has some special features. For example, the settings are grouped differently and swiping to the right on the home screen opens an adaptable news overview.. Additional software, such as Microsoft's complete office suite, is preloaded. Samsung avoids having to pay patent fees to the software developers. Samsung does not install many of its own apps on the Galaxy J3 (2017): S Health is a fitness program and Galaxy Apps is an app store that uses data from Google's Play Store.. A smartphone without LTE support is only thinkable in the absolute lowest price sector now. Thus, the Galaxy J3 (2017) Duos also comes with LTE support, but with a maximum download speed of 150 MBit/s. The Xperia XA1 already offers 300 MBit/s, and the Galaxy J5 also supports higher speeds. However, our review sample is on par with its bigger brother with seven supported LTE bands. The Nokia 3 presents its best side with nine LTE bands. The reception in the German D2 network in an urban area was also good indoors: We usually had the full signal in the LTE network.. The Wi-Fi of the Galaxy J3 has been slimmed down a bit: 802.11 b/g/n is the absolute minimum configuration. In contrast to most other devices in the comparison, the device cannot use the less frequented 5 GHz network, and it does not support fast 802.11ac networks. The review sample's transmission rates are also at the far back in the standardized test routine. We had the full signal near the router and pages opened fairly quickly in practical use. 3/4 of the signal was still received at a distance of ten meters (~33 feet) and through three walls, and pages opened just as fast..

The GPS module could only locate us very inaccurately indoors. Many satellites were quickly found outdoors, but the accuracy did not drop below 13 meters (~42.6 ft), which is quite a poor performance.. We looked at what this means in practice on a mountain bike trip with both Samsung's Galaxy J3 and Garmin's Edge 500 (as a reference device). The measured route is equal - very good. Samsung's Galaxy J3 draws curves as sharp corners unlike Garmin's Edge 500, which is more accurate here. However, the Galaxy J3's tracking performance is overall very good. The device traces our route very accurately for a smartphone.. GPS Garmin Edge 500 â Overview. GPS Garmin Edge 500 â Woods. GPS Garmin Edge 500 â Bridge. GPS Samsung Galaxy J3 â Overview. GPS Samsung Galaxy J3 â Woods. GPS Samsung Galaxy J3 â Bridge. Samsung has created its own phone app that offers a few more features than Google's stock app. For example, it is possible to fade out contacts without an assigned phone number in the overview, making the contact list more cleaned up. It is also possible to look for localities in the area and call them directly, which is convenient when looking for a restaurant. Short messages can be written or a video conference can be started directly in the app.. The call quality makes a mixed impression. On the one hand, we liked the earpiece's sound; the contact's voice sounds relatively clear and natural. On the other hand, the earpiece distorts in high volumes just like the microphone, which also transmits our voice slightly muffled. The speaker generally sounds good in hands-free mode, but the microphone again transmits our voice slightly muffled and hardly records anything when we speak quietly.. Compared with the predecessor, the cameras have been upgraded considerably: 13 rather than 8 megapixels are now on the rear. This is not only the current mid-range standard, but even some premium smartphones do not offer more pixels. After all, the photo quality only depends on the pixel count to a certain degree. The Galaxy J3 proves this quite impressively: Its primary camera, which is lowered slightly into the casing for protection, takes sharp and quite detailed photos. The dynamics in bright and dark areas is decent. Only the colors sometimes look a bit cool. In total, the primary camera's photo quality very much appealed to us.. Videos can be recorded in 1080p at 30 frames per second. The smartphone adapts well to the environment although the photo is sometimes a bit too dark. The auto focus does a good job. However, focusing manually, which is also possible, confuses it and it then needs quite long to adjust the desired focus. The exposure can also be set manually.. The camera app that Samsung developed is relatively intuitive to use. It offers many settings and useful assistance. For example, the right aspect ratio for videos can be viewed beforehand so that objects can be placed properly or one of the installed filters can be used for photos.. Like the predecessor, the front camera has a resolution of 5 megapixels. However, it now has an LED flash. We liked the photo quality; the camera still manages to keep overexposure within limits even in very bright areas. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. The primary camera did a good job in practice. But what does it look like under standardized conditions in the lab? In fact, details are slightly blurred; especially text on a colored background. Outlines of objects generally look a bit fuzzy and the sharpness decreases slightly toward the corners. Nevertheless, the overall photo quality here is good. The color reproduction is visibly too pale, and large, colored areas are sometimes a bit patchy.. ColorChecker: Target color is displayed in the lower half of each patch.. Samsung puts a charger and USB cable in the box besides a headset and SIM tool. Two covers for the device can be purchased via the website: A dual layer cover in different colors (20 Euros/~$23) and a softer jelly cover (15 Euros/~$18).. Samsung includes a 24-month warranty on its devices.. Samsung has developed its own keyboard. It is the only keyboard preloaded on the smartphone. Of course, another keyboard can be downloaded and installed from Google's Play Store. The keyboard is very clearly arranged and resembles Apple's iPhone keyboard slightly. The app provides many settings, such as a one hand mode, can place punctuation marks semi-automatically or be used as a TrackPad for the cursor. Overall, it is possible to type well with the app.. As known from Samsung, there are many aids for impaired users. For example, the keyboard app can be zoomed and its contrast can be increased or flashing light shows notifications when the user has a hearing impairment.. Samsung has also come up with some special ideas. For example, the user is informed about missed calls or notifications when picking up the phone via automatic vibration. A multi-window function that runs several applications on one screen is also present. A basic mode is again available, which provides smartphone novices facilitated handling.. A physical home button and two touch-sensitive menu buttons below the screen are easy to use, but the "back" button is on the right and might need some getting used to. The standby button is on the casing's right and the volume control on the left. Both are easy to find and have clear pressure points, but they could both feel higher quality.. Screens with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels are normal in this price range. Unlike the bigger Galaxy J models or its predecessor , the Galaxy J3 does not have an AMOLED panel but instead a PLS screen. The average brightness of 494 cd/mÂ² is high and can even be increased for a limited time via the outdoor mode; here, we measured a maximum of 572 cd/mÂ². The illumination of 89% is relatively homogeneous, and we did not see a brightness difference in large colored areas with our naked eye.. 459 cd/m² 473 cd/m² 514 cd/m² 483 cd/m² 502 cd/m² 512 cd/m² 496 cd/m² 498 cd/m² 508 cd/m². 89 % Center on Battery: 502. cd/m²) ΔE Color 4.6 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 2.5 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 99.9% sRGB (Calman) Gamma: 2.29.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 8995 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. Samsung's Galaxy J3 presents a decent contrast result: 1434:1 are not record-breaking but quite good. The black value of 0.35 cd/mÂ² is just as satisfactory. The AMOLED devices with an absolute black reproduction have an advantage here, just like many of the comparison devices. It is pleasing that Samsung reduces the screen brightness without flickering; thus, the manufacturer does not use pulse width modification.. There are some predefined display modes for the reproduction. We analyzed these with our spectrophotometer and the CalMAN software and discovered that the cinema setting presents the most natural colors. We only found a bluish tint in the adapted screen mode that is to adjust to every app individually. According to the software that unfortunately does not measure very accurately, sRGB is covered by 99.9% and AdobeRGB by 89.3%..

This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.2 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. The Galaxy J3 can be used well outdoors thanks to its special outdoor mode. It increases the screen's brightness considerably, but then also needs a lot of power. Therefore, it turns off automatically 15 minutes after disabling the screen. It remains active until deactivation otherwise. A bit of the screen's content can be recognized even in direct sunlight in outdoor mode, but looking at contents is not recommendable then because intense reflections strain the eyes anyway. It is possible to work with the Galaxy J3 easily in the shade. The device does not have an ambient light sensor, and thus the brightness has to be adapted manually.. Content remains clear even from the sides thanks to the PLS technology.. We know the Exynos 7570 Quad SoC from Samsung's Galaxy XCover 4. Its processor unit has four cores and clocks at a maximum of 1.4 GHz. This clearly outperforms the performance of the Galaxy J3 (2016) or even Nokia 3. Other devices, such as the Moto G5 , offer considerably more power. We did not encounter stutters while navigating through the operating system in practice. The browser stutters to quite some extent when a game is running in a second window in multi-window mode.. In contrast to the Galaxy XCover 4 , Samsung uses an ARM Mali-T720 MP2 graphics unit, which is the dual-core model with a maximum of 650 MHz, this time. The smartphone is again faster than last year's Galaxy in the benchmarks, but it clearly lags behind its bigger Galaxy J5 (2017) brother..

Unfortunately, the Galaxy J3 (2017) is a bit sluggish when accessing the storage in total. Accessing our Toshiba EXCERIA PRO M501 reference micro-SD card (with extremely high write and read rates possible) is relatively slow on the Galaxy J3 considering the card's potential. However, they can keep up with expensive mid-range devices by comparison.. Our review sample accesses the internal storage much slower than the Moto G5 or Xperia XA1. Sophisticated apps accordingly also need a certain time until they are loaded..

Details sometimes have to be reduced when playing demanding games, such as the racing game Asphalt 8: Airborne. Less demanding games like Angry Birds can be played without issues. Using the touchscreen and position sensor as controls function very reliably here.. Samsung also preloads its own game launcher and an overlay called Game Tools. All installed games can be collected and managed in one place in the Game Launcher. The Game Tools allow making screenshots or enabling a "do not disturb" mode, for example. This does not have an impact on the frame rates as we found out in the test.. Although the casing heats up slightly, the user will hardly notice it. At a maximum of 32.5 Â°C (90.5 Â°F), Samsung's Galaxy J3 always stays pleasantly cool. Thus, it can be put into a pocket even after prolonged load without feeling unpleasantly warm.. We check whether prolonged load without throttling is possible with GFXBench. It is since the frame rates are just as high after thirty loops as in the beginning in the Manhattan 3.1 benchmark.. 31 °C 30 °C 29.3 °C. 32.5 °C 30.5 °C 29.5 °C. 32.5 °C 30.7 °C 29.8 °C.

The little speaker is situated on the casing's upper right area. This is an unusual, yet not a bad position. Trebles are very prominent and background noises sometimes dominate too clearly in songs and videos. The speaker at 80.9 dB(A) has an average loudness. The speaker in Samsung's bigger Galaxy J5 is much louder and its sound output is considerably more linear and more pleasant. Nevertheless, the speaker in the Galaxy J3 can be used for occasionally sampling a song or playing a video soundtrack.. Audiophile users will more likely rely on headphones or speakers. The included headset is decent to start with. The 3.5-mm jack transmits the sound clearly. Sound output also functions very well via Bluetooth.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 28.2 31.1 28.2 25 30.3 30.1 30.3 31 29.3 29.9 29.3 40 33.6 34.4 33.6 50 28 34.6 28 63 27.2 29.3 27.2 80 29.2 32.2 29.2 100 31.9 34.1 31.9 125 39.8 36.9 39.8 160 36.4 23.8 36.4 200 48.4 21.5 48.4 250 51.7 20.9 51.7 315 57.1 21.3 57.1 400 59.8 19.7 59.8 500 65.8 20.1 65.8 630 67.6 18.5 67.6 800 67.7 19.3 67.7 1000 69.5 17.8 69.5 1250 67.8 17.4 67.8 1600 67.5 16.4 67.5 2000 67.6 16.4 67.6 2500 67.9 16.6 67.9 3150 71 16.1 71 4000 74.7 16.1 74.7 5000 71 16.1 71 6300 61 16 61 8000 58.7 16.1 58.7 10000 58.9 16.1 58.9 12500 51.3 16 51.3 16000 39.8 16 39.8 SPL 80.9 30.1 80.9 N 47.9 1.4 47.9 median 61 Samsung Galaxy J3 2017 median 17.4 median 61 Delta 8.7 3.7 8.7 31.6 32 25.4 38.4 25.3 34 32.9 30 33.6 29.6 31.6 28.5 28.4 29.3 27 31.8 20.8 34.9 22 43.4 21.3 49.1 20.8 55.5 21.2 60.7 19.4 63.7 19.5 67.4 17.7 70.2 17.9 71.4 17.8 68.9 17.3 70 17.4 72.6 16.7 75.1 17.2 77.4 18.2 78.1 17.9 81.4 17.6 76.7 17.7 75.4 17.8 74.5 17.9 70.5 18.1 61.8 18.2 58.4 30 86.8 1.3 70 median 17.9 Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) Duos median 70 1.3 9.5 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Frequency diagram comparison (checkboxes above can be turned on/off!). Samsung's Galaxy J3 (2017) does not present its best side when it comes to power consumption. It consumes considerably more power than Samsung's Galaxy J5 and considerably more than its predecessor. The average consumption in both idle and during load belongs to the highest in the comparison field. The device still drains power from the outlet when it is shut down.

Nevertheless, the Galaxy J3 (2017) manages very good runtimes in the Wi-Fi test: It is possible to browse the Internet for just over 12 hours before the device is depleted. The energy management apparently functions very well considering that the consumption is relatively high. Thus, the smartphone will easily last a work day and two days of normal use should also be possible.. An energy-saving mode can be enabled. It has two different levels that modify the system to different degrees. While the medium mode limits background services and reduces the brightness, the maximum mode additionally loads a more basic launcher that is to save energy with a dark theme and limited options.

In review: Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017). Samsung has successfully managed to further develop its Galaxy J3 top-seller. The camera is great and its resolution has been boosted compared with the predecessor. Although the screen is no longer an AMOLED, it is brighter. The performance corresponds to the category, the software is extensive and stylish, the GPS module tracks us accurately, and although the casing's design is a bit restrained, it is elegant and solid. In addition to the dual-SIM support, it is possible to insert a micro-SD card as well.. Criticism can only be applied to details: The battery is now non-removable, which many users will dislike. The somewhat too many preloaded apps might also deter some buyers, but they can be uninstalled with a bit of patience. A 5-GHz Wi-Fi network would have been nice, and the microphone could make clearer recordings.. Samsung's Galaxy J3 (2017) Duos is a well-developed, overall good smartphone from the lower mid-range. The device offers a lot for little money.. In total, the Galaxy J3 leaves us with a high overall impression that involves restrictions typical for the category. Buyers cannot expect a high-end device for just over 200 Euros (~$190). However, Samsung definitely makes the most of the tight budget and offers a smartphone with a very good price-performance ratio.. Samsung Galaxy J3 2017 - 2017-08-04 08/04/2017 v6 Florian Wimmer.

Resolution 720 x 1280 pixels. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features Touch to focus, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes Burst mode, Panorama, Effects. Camcorder 1920x1080 (1080p HD) (30 fps).

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time 23.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time 17.0 days (408 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

FCC ID value: A3LSMJ327A link. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $150 Buy.

Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 … 15 16 ». Anonymous, 01 Feb 2018 It says PLS right on this site gsmarena not 100% correct. Pretty crappy compared to my 3-year old S4. I've had this since November 2017, so just about 3 months. First Google and Chrome browsers stopped. A tech friend of mine fixed it for me. It crashed every time I tried to open it, so I could neither read nor send texts. The guys at Carphone Warehouse couldn't fix it and neither could my tech friend. He finally advised installing the standard free Android Mesages app from PlayStore. I did and it works a treat, easily recovering my old text messages from before. Slower than the old S4 and generally shoddy.. Anonymous, 12 Feb 2018 Had no problem at all with taking videos Ok thanks.

Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016) - user opinions and reviews. let me get this straight the j2 prime is 130 euros and this is 120 euros and this gets android 7.1.1 and the j2 prime is still on 6.0.1 wtf samsung ?. These remarks are of the J3V so your milage may vary, but as for its cheaper end price, it does what you'd expect for the price. When new it ran great, but as time went on it got unbearably slow. Updating and downloading apps takes forever and severe.... I wanted a basic phone with some apps and basic internet. But it comes with lollipop and that means you cant run apps of sd card. Some apps can be moved but that really does on move a portion of it not all.

SIM Only SIM Samsung Galaxy S7 black Apple iPhone 7 32GB black Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge black Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus black Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus rose pink Apple iPhone 7 32GB rose gold Samsung Galaxy S8 black Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge gold Samsung Galaxy S8 grey. A prime example of budget phones getting better. In our Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) review we find that even a budget phone has plenty to offer. The Galaxy J3 (2017) is the smallest and cheapest of the 2017 Galaxy J series but if you want a little more, then you should check out our Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) review and our Samsung Galaxy J7 (2017) review .. The Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) gives just a touch of the good stuff, with a metal housing that holds the glass front and polycarbonate back cover. Overall, the design sees an improved slimline design with, most notably, a camera module on the rear that now sits flush with the body.. New: Vodafone Smart E8 review. As the smallest of the J series, the Galaxy J3 (2017) is very light at 142g and is reasonably slim at 8.2mm thick. Three colour choices should cater to all tastes with the choice of gold, black or blue.. At 5 inches, the LCD display isn’t too large and this has HD resolution, which equates to 1280 x 720 pixels.. There is nothing amazing to shout about in the performance area with a 1.4GHz quad-core processor with 2GB RAM. However, this Samsung phone will most probably perform better than the budget phone your are replacing.. Undoubtedly, the first thing that you will want to do is to transfer content over from your old smartphone or iPhone. For this, the Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) has a 16GB memory, of which 10.3GB is free to the user.. There is a microSD card slot, so you can buy a memory card and boost the memory by up to 256GB. At this point, it is possible to create a Samsung account for free and this will give you access to the Samsung Cloud and 15GB of free space.. Samsung Cloud can be used to backup, restore and synchronise your content. You also may like to set up the Secure Folder, which encrypts your private data, files, apps and voice recordings.. If you are a budget phone buyer then the Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) can also help keep your data charges in check. The Data Saver prevents apps from sending or receiving unnecessary data in the background and you can turn mobile data off altogether, if you just want to use Wi-Fi.. If you do keep mobile data active then there is a mobile data alert feature. You can also check the mobile data usage of individual apps, in order to identify apps that are eating up your allowance.. The Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) runs Google’s Android 7.0 Nougat operating system. The standard series of Google apps are pre-loaded and these includes the Chrome browser, Drive, Maps, Duo, Gmail and more.. To make life easier, there is a one-handed keyboard, Google Voice typing and a multi-window split screen set up. This will let you run two apps side-by-side, which is great for keeping an eye on your social feed while watching a YouTube video or while browsing the web.. Samsung does a great job with its own apps and some are pre-loaded, while others can be downloaded from the Galaxy Apps store. Dual Messenger is the first such app and this allows you to have two messaging accounts open at the same time, so that you don’t have to log in and log out on a constant basis.. Other features on the Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) includes Samsung Notes and Smart Alert. Smart Alert makes the phone vibrate when you pick it up, if there have been missed calls or notifications.. You will also find a handy Outdoor mode that brightens the screen for 15 minutes, for better outdoor visibility. Quick Optimisation keeps things running well and can delete unnecessary files, closes apps running in the background, scan for malware and clear unneeded items from the memory.. Music is projected well from the Galaxy J3 (2017) due to its side-positioned speaker. Located here, it doesn’t matter which way up you place the phone on a surface.. If you listen to music through headphones then you can enjoy sound effects such as Surround, Tube Amp Pro or Concert Hall. You can also customise the sound further with the built in equaliser.. The high resolution 13MP camera has a f/1.9 aperture that lets in plenty of light, which is particularly useful under low light scenarios. You can launch the camera quickly by pressing the Home key twice and the floating camera button makes it easy to activate the shutter, in both portrait or landscape orientations.. All of the shooting modes that you would expect to find are there, including Auto, Pro, Panorama, Sports, Sound & Shot and Continuous Shot.. The 5MP selfie camera is on par with others in this pricing bracket. It benefits from a selfie flash and there is an on screen beauty button, which will instantly enhance your results.. Selfies can be difficult to take but the process is made easier on the Galaxy J3 (2017) by gesture recognition. Here, you can show your palm to the camera and the camera then activates the shutter for you, two seconds after making the gesture.. The 2,400mAh battery isn’t huge but it does perform very well. With this battery you should be able to enjoy up to 61 hours of music playback or up to 14 hours of internet use, 14 hours of video playback or up to 15 hours of talk time.. If you do get low on juice or know that you will be away from a charger for a longer period of time, then you can active the Mid or Max power saving modes.. Next: Samsung Galaxy J7 (2017) review.

Wanna do it to get past the network tethering thing. But even planet didn't stop my 8gigs from being used up. So I've started searching for how to keep going with my hotspot. I have no idea how to do anything past basics. So the more detailed and lamen the answers the easier. I guess to root the Samsung j3 with nougat on it is first get past unlocking it. Any helpful tip to get the unlock code for free?. A lot of techno babble baffled me all night long. So yeah that's what I'm trying to get help with. Thanks for the time you guys may spend.

Mine is a Samsung J3 Unlocked (SM-327U) running Android 7.0 with May 1, 2017 patches. I've enabled the "OEM unlock" under Developer Options but I can't find a tutorial or TWRP image that supports this version. I want to install SuperSU but I'm stuck without TWRP support. I've already tried both OneClickRoot and Kingo, both of which state that the device is unsupported. I'm assuming that under the hood they are just scripting out the process but still using the same Odin/TWRP/etc process. Any ideas? Is there a way to translate the changes necessary from another version of the J3 (e.g. SM-327YZ) to this firmware or are we stuck waiting for supported to be added to these (awesome) tools?.

After the phone is unlocked it should be easier to root it. I have a few more days in my service cycle till I reach the phone active 90 days to get the free unlock. After that I'll start trying to figure out how to flash it again. The Following User Says Thank You to Bandcamp For This Useful Post: [ View ].

My Devices: Google Pixel XL , Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 , T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy Note 8. My J727T is carrier unlocked because i bought it outright at full retail. I dont know how an carrier unlocked device would change anything. Our bootloader is locked which has nothing to do with being carrier unlocked.... After the phone is unlocked it should be easier to root it. I have a few more days in my service cycle till I reach the phone active 90 days to get the free unlock. After that I'll start trying to figure out how to flash it again. The Following User Says Thank You to AndroidDevices For This Useful Post: [ View ]. Join Date: Joined: Jun 2008.

My Devices: Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 , Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017). I successfully rooted my J327U witb Chainfire's CF Autoroot (the T-Mobile variant J327T) via Odin. After Root I installed Flashfire ( also by xda-developer Chainfire). I'm still playing with the app's various features but so far it is pretty awesome definitely an app I'll be making a donation to this next paycheck) you'll be able to make a backup of your device with it. I also have a Samsung J3 running Nougat that I would like to root. Mine is a Samsung J3 Unlocked (SM-327U) running Android 7.0 with May 1, 2017 patches. I've enabled the "OEM unlock" under Developer Options but I can't find a tutorial or TWRP image that supports this version. I want to install SuperSU but I'm stuck without TWRP support. I've already tried both OneClickRoot and Kingo, both of which state that the device is unsupported. I'm assuming that under the hood they are just scripting out the process but still using the same Odin/TWRP/etc process. Any ideas? Is there a way to translate the changes necessary from another version of the J3 (e.g. SM-327YZ) to this firmware or are we stuck waiting for supported to be added to these (awesome) tools?.

I have a metropcs variant and everyone else in another thread has also. Me and a few others have tried for months to get root and it failed miserably. You can get it on samsung.com. if i used the CFauto root would that allow me to root the tmobile variant?. Posting Quick Reply - Please Wait.
