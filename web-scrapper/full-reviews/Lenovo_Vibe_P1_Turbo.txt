Lenovo Vibe P1 Turbo With 13-Megapixel Camera, 5000mAh Battery Launched. Robin Sinha , 11 February 2016. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Lenovo has quietly launched the 'Turbo' variant of its Vibe P1 smartphone in Indonesia. The Lenovo Vibe P1 Turbo is available for pre-orders at IDR 3,999,000 (roughly Rs. 20,000) in Silver, Graphite Gray, and Gold colour variants. The handset's availability details outside the region are not yet known.. The dual-SIM (Micro-SIM + Micro-SIM) supporting Vibe P1 Turbo shares almost all the specifications with that of the Lenovo Vibe P1, but with a slightly better rear camera. While the Vibe P1 features a 13-megapixel rear camera, the Vibe P1 Turbo features a 13-megapixel autofocus rear camera. Rest of the innards remain the same, though there is a mismatch with the specifications on the company's product page - which mentions both 2GB and 3GB of RAM, both 13-megapixel and 16-megapixel camera, and both a 4900mAh battery (minimum) and a 5000mAh battery (typical) as well.. As per the company listing , the 4G LTE (with support for Indian LTE bands) supporting Lenovo Vibe P1 Turbo runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop, and is a powerhouse featuring a 5000mAh battery. It features a 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) IPS display with pixel density of 401ppi; Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor clocked at 1.5GHz; Adreno 405 GPU; 3GB of RAM (though as we said, 2GB is also mentioned); 32GB storage; expandable storage support via microSD card (up to 128GB); and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. It measures 75.6x9.9x152.9mm, weighs 187 grams, and houses connectivity features such as NFC, USB OTG, FM Radio, A-GPS, Bluetooth v4.1, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n/ac, and Wi-Fi Hotspot. Also featured are accelerometer, proximity sensor, and ambient light sensor.. ( Also see: Lenovo Vibe P1 and Vibe P1m First Impressions ). The company last year also launched its Lenovo Vibe P1m smartphone along with the Vibe P1. The handset is the 'lite' variant of the Vibe P1, and features a smaller display, different processor, and less RAM. It sports a 5-inch HD (720x1280 pixels) display, is powered by a 64-bit quad-core MediaTek MT6735 processor with 2GB RAM, and 16GB storage with expandable storage support..

Lenovo Vibe P1 Turbo features, specification and price in India. Lenovo has introduced Vibe P1 Pro as Vibe P1 Turbo in Indonesia. The phone is yet to be launched in India and it is very unlikely to touch Indian shores anytime soon. Here’s our initial impression of Lenovo Vibe P1 Turbo based on features, specification and price. The Lenovo Vibe P1 Turbo aka Pro has a slightly upgraded camera as compared Vibe P1. Apart from autofocus enabled 13-megapixel primary camera and additional 1GB RAM all other specs are same. Like Vibe P1, it sports a 5.5-inch full HD display, octa-core Snapdragon 615 SoC coupled with a fingerprint sensor embedded in the home button. The chipset is supported by 3GB RAM which comes handy in multi-tasking. Lenovo has added a copious 5000mAh battery to ensure you don’t have to worry about running out of charge. It also supports fast charging via 24W bundled quick charger and a power save mode which can come to rescue in odd hours. As per the company claims, bundled charger can refill 40 percent of the battery in just 30 minutes. The dual SIM phone supports 4G LTE on both SIMs. It also supports 3G, WiFi 802.11, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS as connectivity options. The currently offered in Silver, Graphite Gray and Gold colors. Currently, Lenovo Vibe P1 Turbo online price is IDR 3,999,000 which roughly translates to Rs. Large battery Dedicated key to toggle into Power saver mode Metallic side edges 4G LTE support.

A bit heavier than normal phone or redmi note 3, but it does a better job than any other phone. 1) Battery backup 2) NFC 3) Good Processor. 1) No Volte (Hope Lenovo update the s/w to support it). Its is a good phone in this range ... Ram Rom Battery Fast charging time 1:30 mins for full Look Fingerprint Flash power Camera i good and average Marshmallow update No heating problem.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars A Good One. Using it since the last 2 months, bought this to replace my ASUS Zenfone 5, and I am mighty glad i did, choice was between Moto G 4 plus and this. Pros - 1.5 GHz octacore ARM Cortex A53 + Adreno 405, 3 GB RAM, 32 GB ROM (with 91 apps inclusive system apps, installed 20 GB still remains), 5000 mah battery, 5.5 1080 x 1920 pixels, 400dpi FHD screen (CPUZ) - Morning 8 AM charged it full and at 10 PM night it shows 74% charge still left, on moderate use. - OTA update to Android Marshmallow 6.0.1, about 1.6 GB download. - Turbo charger does charge fast, in my case from 44% to 100% in just over an hour. - 9 different sensors (CPUZ) - NFC - Plastic Backcover, Screen guard and an OTG adapter in the box. - No heating issue in my case. Cons - NFC app present in Android L (5.1), but lost after Android M (6.0.1) OTA update, a very bad thing to happen, NFC available in settings. - Images clicked at night show washed out colors, daylight photography good (did not try flash photography). - A tad heavy after adding an TPU back cover and Tempered Glass. - Fingerprint sensor recognizes fast, but to unlock completely it takes about 2 seconds. Appears that won't be given. Problem starts, every time I restart or phone itself restarts, Memory card is not recognised but on my PC it is recognised..

Charging problem, battery saber mode problem,hanging problem and many more.Worst phone till now. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars Misaligned Home button in my piece - A sure upset.. The product was delivered in 48 hours from the day I ordered and the packing and delivery was satisfactory. I ordered this as a second phone and did not bother to see or use the phone till today morning (after a week from delivery). The seller prompted me for a review and I really appreciate their proactive approach. Overall the phone looks amazing and ergonomics and all look more than average for a budget phone. There is one small thing that bothers me a little and that is the placement of the home button (fingerprint scanner). In the piece I received the button is misaligned. I even installed a screen guard this morning to verify the same. There is a slight gap visible of top left and bottom right edges of the scanner button. The misalignment can be noticed from basic eye as well. I wasn't expecting something of this sort especially as this isn't a cheap phone and probably the vibe is one of the premium phones manufactured by Lenovo. I am not sure if this is the manufacturer's fault, a design flaw or a used piece packed as new..

By Tanisha Malhotra on April 10, 2017 | Verified Owner. The battery life is for sure a big big plus point. In fact there is a special button to for the power saver mode, which I was pretty dubious about in the beginnin; as I thought it has really no use. But, trust me it's a very good feature as the phone works for 5 more hours even at 12% battery. It's handy and has nice graphics. (Though it's not so smooth and quick) Camera works well in good lighting. No need for pins to remove or swap Sims.. Was this review helpful? 0 0. Have you used this product?
