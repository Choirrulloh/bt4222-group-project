VaÅ¾na napomena: Sve cene objavljene na sajtu su informativnog karaktera, obavezno proverite svaku cenu telefonom.. 25.12.2017 :: 22:51 h :: IP > 212.200.247.165 :: 1678852. Evo, i ja nakon godinu dana da se oglasim. Bez ijednog baga kroz godinu dana, imam 5-6 aplikacija i svaka radi odlicno. Telefon nema 4G medjutim ako ne ocekujete da vam se film skine dok skuvate kafu je i vise nego dovoljno. Plastika je solidnog kvaliteta, ne najboljeg ali za te pare prihvatljivog Najveca mana mu je baterija, ja ga cesto 2x dnevno putim jer mailove i razne aplikavije zbog posla dpsta cesto i dugo koristim. Sto se tice rada, brzine, jedva da ima vidne razlike. Da o zvuku na slusalicama ne pricam, presavrseno je odradjeno, medjutim bex sluski je zvuk zaista tih. Ko razmislja da ga uzme, za ove pare i vise nego vredi! Jedino PowerBank neka uzme kao dodatak i ima savrsenatvo (odnos cene i kvaliteta) u rukama! â¡ vuk. 11.12.2017 :: 17:24 h :: IP > 178.220.94.133 :: 1677528. Citam komentare i slazem se sa sviima onima koji hvale ovaj telefon! Masina i jeste za svaku pohvalu, imam ga 4 nedelje, ja sam odusevljen, pre njega sam imao Asusa isto sa 2 Gb RAMA kome je i hidroelektrana Djerdap nedovoljna da ga napoji i napuni uvek praznu bateriju, a da ne pricam koliko sam kafa mogao da skuvam na Asusu dok radi sa vise aplikacija u isto vreme, koji em laguje em se greje kao furuna! Svega toga nema kod ovog lepotana HTC Desire 630, jedina OZBILJNA ali bas OZBILJNA zamerka mi je to sto nema Multifunkcionalnu LE diodu u gornjem delu kucista, koja bi svetlela crveno prilikom punjenja, zeleno prilikom napunjenosti, kao i treptala -blinkala plavo u slucaju propustenog poziva, primljenog SMS ili Emaila. Ova LE Dioda bi trebala biti obavezni standard za svaki novi telefon, jer ne trosi skoro nista struje za svoj rad, a zavrsava posao za 10. Sve u svemu, smirih se i progledah sa HTC posle agonije sa Asus Zen 2! â¡ dejan. 10.12.2017 :: 23:06 h :: IP > 178.148.216.74 :: 1677488. Ljudi,ja na ovom telefonu jako slabo Äujem sagovornika na zvucniku,Å¡est puta gore nego li na xperiji 1 koja me je vrhunski sluÅ¾ila 4 godine.. Toliko me nekada to izludjuje, da bi vrlo rado vratio kartice u stari tel.. Da li je joÅ¡ neko imao sliÄnu situaciju,I da li da reklamiram mts-u.. Kapiram da Äe da me olade i da kaÅ¾u da je sve ok.. Ne mogu da verujem da ima ovako los zvuÄnik.sve ostalo je ok,mada je nisam neki fon fanatic.al ovo sa zvucnikom je loÅ¡e baÅ¡... 29.09.2017 :: 21:18 h :: IP > 93.87.238.13 :: 1670980. koristim ovaj aparat godinu i nesto jace dana i imam zaista samo reci hvale. Baterija bi mogla da bude jaca ali realno lako izdrzi ceo dan u normalnim rezimimz rada. Plastika je vrhunska sa obzirom da su mi ruke cesto od ulja i benzina i telefon i dalje odlicno izgleda. Imao sam skoro problem da mi je oslabio wifi pa sam poslao telefon u servis preko mts-a i resili u toku nedelje. 20.09.2017 :: 21:02 h :: IP > 37.19.105.21 :: 1669966. Fenomenalan uredjaj! Sve radi savrseno i lepo, kvalitet zaista ok, kamera zadnja izuzetna, ram i graficka odlicno odradjuju posai, baterija pun dan u jacem koriscenju i vredi max za te pare. 29.05.2017 :: 16:08 h :: IP > 95.180.8.69 :: 1658102. Pohvale: Ekran (SuperLCD) za poÅ¡tovanje! Prikaz boja, osvetlenje, za postovanje. Zvucnik, solidan, sluske odlicbe! Zvuk u njima, izuzetno jak, ima taj Dolby koji vrsi posao za sve pare. Mane: Baterija, katastrofa! Na 5" ekranu ovih 2200mah, "ne rade" nikakav posao! Ispod 2800-3000mah, niÅ¡ta. Kvalitet izrade, tj plastika koja se guli na dnu ledja! Bilo mi i jasno zaÅ¡to u mt:s-u daju ovaj tel skoro pa dzaba, a i HTC dao dve fabriÄke maske! Kamere su ok, prednja uÅ¾as. Ali dobro, Å¡ta je tu je. Po meni HTC definitivno mora da podbaci sa cenom, jer od njih ako hoce iole pristojan tel mora dzep da otvori, ili dobro da se naplati racuna na rae da bi od njih vajde neke imao. 27.04.2017 :: 19:37 h :: IP > 178.148.142.143 :: 1654266. Molio bih sve korisnike ovog modela da pogledaju klip koji sam postavio na YT tu sam objasnio sve kako aktivirati 4G i kako prebaciti prenos podataka bez fizickog vadjenja sim kartice.

Koristim po prvi put htc,odlican telefon !Call history,call duration postoje i fabricki dolaze,baterija je dobra,radi fluidno,bez bagova...Interfejs je vrhunski,bas sve mozes da prilagodis kako ti odgovara sense home i blink feed odlicni ! Jedina primedba je mozda malo slabiji zvucnik ali zato slusalice koje dobijete uz telefom izuvaju,brutalan kvalitet i zvuk. Od mene cista 5-ica ! â¡ xlx. 21.01.2017 :: 12:46 h :: IP > 109.92.3.137 :: 1644813. Telefon imam otprilike mesec dana,nemam problema nikakvih sa njim,citam ovde da imaju ljudi problem sa baterijom sto se i meni pojavilo drugi dan koristenja(iscurila za 5-6 sati).Tada sam ga resetovao na fabricko(opet instalirao meni potrebne aplikacije) i od tada baterija traje cak po 2 dana umerenog koristenja, a nikada mi koliko ga god koristio nije trajala manje od jedan dan.Sto se tice kamere ona bi mogla mozda biti malo bolja kada je osvetlenje slabije ali je i to podnosljivo.Sve u svemu zadovoljan sam telefonom. 24.08.2016 :: 19:59 h :: IP > 93.87.194.149 :: 1628688. Ako izuzmemo slabu bateriju, slab zvucnik i dosta siromaÅ¡an operativni sistem (ne postoji call history, call durationâ¦) Å¡to se normalno moÅ¾e naknadno instalirati telefon nije uopste loÅ¡ ð â¡ zoran. 21.07.2016 :: 01:23 h :: IP > 109.92.189.119 :: 1624089. Posle nekoliko dana koriscenja evo utisaka. HTC je ispeglao svoju verziju androida do savrsenstva, kako radi telefon na snapdragon 400 ja ne verujem, kao da je u pitanju neki octa-core a ne quad.Nema razlike u brzini rada izmedju njega i mog meizu m2 note koji je octa core,predobro radi.Sve klizi savrseno,kako navigacija kroz menije telefona tako i web browsing, Kamera malo bolja nego na mom meizu m2, zvuk preko zvucnika je ok,cist ali ne preglasan, dok je preko slusalica u rangu ako ne i bolji od iphone i samsung s7[ne preterujem],dual sim radi odlicno, ekran je veoma dobar i lepe boje, super lcd je, koji je posle samsungovog super amoleda najbolji. Baterija meni izgura 1 dan lagano, drugi dan mora da se puni, dok na meizu m2 note je baterija ipak bila bolja,ali ni ova nije losa,naprotiv.U paketu dolaze vrhunske slusalice, za nijansu su bolje od xiaomi hybrid dual driver slusalica, dve tvrde maske,trakica za vezivanje,punjac, znaci veoma bogato pakovanje za danasnji standard. Sve u svemu, telefon je cista desetka, bio sam skeptican zbog procesora,medjutim HTC je odradio optimizaciju savrseno,telefon za preporuku!!! â¡ gogi. U Play 64GB - 636. Desire 10 Pro - 339.

The company seems to be gradually weaning itself away from the entry range on which it as betting on earlier.. The HTC Desire 630 4G LTE dual sim is not just another pretty face in the market, there is more to it than the eye candy on offer. First impressions: the phone is sturdily built despite not having any trace of metal on its body. To enhance its build, it comes with four interlocking shells in different colours. The phone is surprisingly light and compact to use.. Specs: 5-inch HD Super LCD (720×1280 pixels) | Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 quad-core with 2GB RAM | 16GB storage expandable up to 2TB | 13MP rear + 5MP front camera | 2,200mAh battery | Android 6.0. The HTC 630 delivers the Marshmallow experience like no other mid-segment phone does. The interface is breezy and fresh. Navigation is quite the delight with vertical scrolling, blink list and customisable home screen. Overall user experience of the phone, I would say, is smooth. I specially loved the keypad and found it very easy to use.. Watching videos on the 5-inch screen in 1280×720 pixels was not bad either.. The camera comes with an array of options and I had nothing to complain about the quality of the images. The secondary camera, however, does not deliver the best selfies despite the 5MP specification. And it is very sensitive to recognising gestures as it would capture the image even if you as much as blink your eyes.. With a 2,200 mAh battery, the desire 630 is mostly running on fumes. Be prepared to put your training in performing a CPR to test as you would have to resuscitate a dead phone at least once in a day. So don’t forget to carry that charger along.. The phone comes with Dolby headphones which don’t really deliver the best sound, in my opinion. Playing music without the headphones is also quite the drag as it is hard to hear anything, even after cupping your hands to the phone’s speaker.. At Rs 14,990 this is not the best smartphone on offer in the market where Chinese manufacturers such as LeEco and Xiaomi are offering cheaper phones with higher specifications. The HTC Desire 630 offers the best in terms of design in the Desire series, but falls short of matching user expectations in a price sensitive market like India..
