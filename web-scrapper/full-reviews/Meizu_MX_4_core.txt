CNET también está disponible en español.. Meizu MX 4-core (unlocked) review:. The Good The Meizu MX 4-core is attractive, compact, and flaunts an Apple-like aesthetic. It runs Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and a fast quad-core CPU. The phone supports nine bands plus comes with 32GB of storage.. The Bad The Meizu MX 4-core is meant for Chinese markets only. For $530, the unlocked handset is pricey. The Meizu's screen is dim and unimpressive.. The Bottom Line The Meizu MX 4-core is a compelling iPhone clone, but there are much better unlocked Android handsets available.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. At just 0.4 inch thick, the MX 4-core is easy to slip into pockets. Unfortunately the Meizu MX 4-core's display is dim and lacks much contrast. The Meizu MX 4-core's back is smooth and glossy to a fault. Editors' note: We recently reviewed the Meizu MX handset. Because of the two devices' similar construction and features, applicable portions of that review will be used in this evaluation of the Meizu MX 4-core.. The Chinese company Meizu has turned copycatting Apple's iPhone style into an art, first with its iPod-like music players, and then by creating a whole Android smartphone line that mimicked the superpopular handset right down to masking the OS in an iOS-flavored skin. The manufacturer's most recent product evolution is the $530 (4,099 HKD) Meizu MX 4-core. This latest addition to the MX line now boasts speedy quad-core power, Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS), and a roomy 32GB of internal storage. That makes the Meizu MX 4-core a powerful little number, that is, if you can find it outside of mainland China or Hong Kong.. Meizu's MX 4-core, the quad-core iPhone lookalike (pictures). Don't be surprised if the Meizu MX 4-core looks familiar. That's because it's the spitting image of its predecessor, the Meizu MX. This trim and polished handset could also be a twin, or certainly close relative, of the iPhone 3G or an iPod music player.. The phone's front face is all black and is sculpted in the rounded curves that Apple loves. Similar to Apple's uberphone too is the MX 4-core's 960x640-pixel resolution screen that boasts the same pixel count as the iPhone's vaunted Retina Display. The Meizu's larger 4-inch real estate, though, compared with 3.5 inches, means its pixel density is lower.. That said, I found the MX 4-core's screen merely adequate for typical smartphone tasks like viewing text, pictures, and wallpaper. Compared with the recent crop of modern Android handsets such as the HTC One X and Samsung Galaxy S3, the Meizu's ASV LCD screen can't hold its own.. Side by side with those phones, its display looks dim, lacks contrast, and has a distracting yellow tinge. For instance the Meizu lacks the deep blacks and vibrant colors its competition offers. Plus, like typical LCDs, viewing angles deteriorate quickly when the display is tilted off-axis.. Despite its blatant mimicry of a late-model iPhone, the Meizu MX 4-core's design is subtle, even elegant. Above the screen is a minute VGA (0.3-megapixel) camera. Gone, though, is the faint Meizu nameplate written in old-style Chinese characters, which graced the previous Meizu MX.. Underneath the display, however, you'll still find two of the slickest capacitive buttons I've seen on a smartphone. Consisting of clusters of LEDs, or Light Keys as Meizu calls them, the buttons change configuration depending on what's happening on the phone's screen. For instance, within applications, the left key becomes a triangle of three dots, essentially a Back button.. The right key is usually arranged in three dots in a line indicating its Menu function, but when you flip the MX 4-core between landscape and portrait modes, the keys intelligently adjust their orientation accordingly. The keys also double as notification lights, pulsing gently when new e-mails or texts arrive. A more traditional raised circular Home button sits in between the MX 4-core's distinctive Light Keys.. The only other controls are a thin volume bar on the left side, Micro-USB port on the bottom, and a 3.5mm headphone jack plus tiny power button running across the top edge.. Breaking from the iPhone's design theme, the Meizu MX 4-core sports a thin metal bezel around the display along with white plastic edges and back, not the iconic chrome or glass construction. Even so, the 4.9-ounce handset has a solid heft to it and premium-feeling build quality. Measuring 4.8 inches tall by 2.5 inches deep and just 0.4 inch thick, the MX is easy to slip into pockets, too.. While the unit I tested was an engineering sample and not the final run of the product, I don't care for the MX 4-core's glossy back, which feels too slippery and fingerprint-prone for my tastes. I prefer phones with a textured back plate or even a soft-touch coating for a more secure grip.. Running Ice Cream Sandwich version 4.0.3, the Meizu MX 4-core comes carrying a fresh infusion of the Android operating system. Just like the previous Meizu MX, the MX 4-core's lock screen features a suspiciously OS X-like starry-night-sky wallpaper. A digital clock floats above cleanly drawn icons for phone and messages, and tapping the symbols launches these functions. Corresponding alerts, like missed calls or unread texts, will appear there, too, which is a nice touch. Dragging the padlock symbol up to the center of the screen whisks you straight to the home screen.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition....

At first glance the Meizu MX 4-core's gallery looks similar to the Gingerbread Android gallery, but it's actually a custom-made app. It stacks images from folders just like the regular app, but this is about where similarities end.. The custom gallery  Picking multiple photos. Inside the folders, images are arranged in a rectangular grid. You can email, share (via Bluetooth, MMS) or delete multiple images by picking them one by one from the grid after you tap and hold on a photo.. Viewing a single image  editing options  details. When viewing a single image, a tap on the screen will display the available options. You can Share, Crop, Delete, Set Wallpaper, Rotate, Open in Image Editor and view Details.. The Meizu MX came with a very good file browser preinstalled. It lets you browse the contents of the built-in memory and offers features such as copy, paste and delete for multiple files. Sharing files over Bluetooth or email is also easy as are batch operations with multiple files and folders.. The file manager is very capable. The file browser also handled opening and extracting ZIP files, which can come in handy.. The Meizu MX 4-core comes with a dedicated Video app, but it expects videos to be placed in a certain folder. You can use the file browser to get videos to play from elsewhere - it offers thumbnails and everything so we ended up using it more often than the Video app itself.. Once you get into the player, things really start to look up. The player handled all the DivX, XviD and H.264 files we threw at it trouble-free (in .AVI, .MKV and .MP4 containers) and resolution didn't matter either - 1080p videos played without a hitch. The audio codecs weren't a problem either.. You also get a lot of nice options - a dedicated brightness setting for the video player and lock UI key. You can zoom in and out with pinch gestures. If additional audio streams or subtitles are available you'll get additional icons on the display for more settings. Note that Chinese and English fonts are supported only.. Playing a video  A lot of settings are available. With the MHL connectivity, the Meizu MX 4-core turns into a very capable video player. Even without it, at 4" big and with 960x640 resolution you can enjoy 720p videos reasonably comfortable though the 3:2 aspect ratio of the screen will involve some cropping if you want to use all the pixels. Still, the much larger 16:9 HD screens of the MX 4-core competitors do a far better job for watching videos on the go.. Just like the video player, the music player can only find tracks located in a specific folder. You can browse your collection the traditional way or you can select to have it filtered by folders... In the first case tracks are sorted into several playlists like All songs, Recently added, Folders and you have the option to create custom playlists. When viewing All songs you can choose between three types of sorting in a tabbed layout: song name, artist and album.. The music controls are at the bottom of the screen, with a small album thumb. If you tap on the album art you'll get to the full-screen Now Playing interface featuring repeat and shuffle buttons, playback controls, a volume slider and a scrubber.. The middle section with the full-size album art is side-scrollable: you can swipe to the left or right to display the current playlist or the lyrics karaoke style.. The Now playing interface  Fetching album art automatically  Current playlist and the karaoke-style lyrics. You can access the equalizer from the advanced menu. It features several presets, which you can edit manually.. Picking an equalizer preset and editing it. If the music player is working you'll get music controls on the lockscreen - there're always available in the task switcher too.. The music player also has a play timer, which will turn it off automatically in 5 - 60 minutes.. The Meizu MX 4-core went off to an impressive start in our audio quality test. When attached to an active external amplifier, the smartphone did impressively well, with the average intermodulation distortion remaining its only non-perfect score. The MX 4-core also turned out to be pretty loud, unlike its predecessor.. Another difference between the two MX generations is the headphones on performance. While last time around we saw a huge drop in performance when we plugged in the set we usually use for testng, this time around the degradation was limited to some extra distortion and stereo crosstalk. It's an ideal performance, but it should be as good as ideal for everyone, but the most demanding audiophiles out there.. And here go the results so you can see for yourselves..

The Meizu MX 4-Core is a truly interesting phone. And as an extention of that, Meizu itself is an interesting company. Founded by Jack Wong, it gained international notoriety when its M8 smartphone drew unwelcome comparisons to Apple's iPhone, particularly from Apple's lawyers, resulting in an early end to its production run.. Meizu claims to be fully vertically integrated - manufacturing, marketing, and selling its phones, a start-to-finish philosophy that results in decreased overhead and more control over its products (it should be noted that Meizu does not actually make all of the components in its phones, however). And the reason it has gone that route is probably obvious to everyone at this point: Mr. Wong and his company want to be the homegrown Chinese smartphone-maker to challenge Apple's increasing presence in the country.. Meizu's main point of appeal? Price. Its 32GB MX 4-Core retails for a mere 3000CYN (appx. $470US), and can be used on most any GSM carrier. If one wanted to do the same with a 16GB iPhone 4S in China, you'd have to cough up almost twice that amount - around 5000CYN (appx. In a country where many cannot afford costly service contracts and prefer to use prepaid phones, the draw of a cheap (relatively speaking) but fully-featured smartphone is obvious. Wong's latest creation, the MX 4-Core, is a well-priced, powerful piece of hardware. In fact, I can't think of a phone out there that provides more processing power and storage for your money than the MX 4-Core (though that statement is heavily asterisked by software issues).. Unfortunately, we don't really write smartphone reviews with the Chinese market in mind. We're thinking about North America, Europe, and other locations where most of today's cutting-edge handsets are readily available. And from that standpoint, the MX 4-Core feels rather incomplete. Sure, its powerful quad-core processor provides excellent performance, and it has an impressive 32GB entry-level storage capacity. But in the US and Europe, its low MSRP is less relevant - many people get their phones on contract, or buy them over a period of time on a carrier equipment plan. And really, the price is most of the sales pitch for the MX 4-Core. In the US, a phone like this just wouldn't be able to compete (though we'll probably never see it here).. Issues of value for money aside, though, the MX 4-Core has plenty of other flaws that would make me wary of recommending it. Software comes first to mind - Flyme OS 1.0, Meizu's heavily skinned take on Android 4.0, feels like a strange Android / MIUI (a custom ROM) / iOS hybrid. It all looks very nice, but the practical reality is that most users have absolutely no desire to live in this unfinished, half-Android, half-not purgatory. It just never felt right to me. Bugs and befuddling feature implementations are all too common, and many perfectly good core Android staples are simply tossed out the window for no apparent reason.. But before I get too far ahead of myself, how about one of those whole "review" things?. Processor: 1.4GHz Exynos quad-core (32nm). Network Compatibility: Pentaband GSM (HSDPA 850 / 900 / 1700 / 1900 / 2100). Operating System: Android 4.0.3 with Flyme OS 1.0 overlay. Display: 4" AVS LCD 640x960 (288DPI). Memory: 1GB RAM / 32GB storage (29.8GB usable). Cameras: VGA front, 8MP rear. NFC / Bluetooth: No / Yes, v2.1. Ports / Expandable Storage: microUSB / none. The MX 4-Core seems to be a solidly constructed phone. Seams are nice and tight, and the removable rear cover is very well-secured - it actually requires a (very simple) tool in order to be removed.. The simplistic, minimalist design isn't exactly original (in front profile with the display off, it looks eerily like an iPhone), but given some of the ugly, fussy phones we've seen lately, the MX is refreshingly tasteful and sleek, if a bit dated.. Performance is quite good, and the MX 4-Core buzzes through most tasks with ease, though the occasional slowdown (especially in 3rd-party apps) was something I definitely noticed.. Aesthetically, Flyme OS is actually quite nice. It's very minimalistic, and runs pretty smoothly.. A 32GB starting point for storage is something everyone else needs to pick up on, and along with a cutting-edge quad-core at this price point is great value for money.. Flyme OS may be pretty, but the upsides stop there. So much of the usefulness of stock Android has been stripped out and mutated that the phone starts to feel crippled - Meizu wants to emulate iOS in ways that just don't make sense (eg, no app drawer). There's also a lot of general weirdness and bugginess going on with Flyme that I don't like. For me, it's bad enough that it ruins the phone.. Trying to hear somebody when you're on this phone is basically impossible - the earpiece speaker is garbage and gets no where near loud enough.. The hardware home button is too small, and having it stick out rather than in means it's no longer a natural resting place for your thumb, and is therefore harder for it to find.. It really is trying to be an iPhone in some ways.. Clean and solid, if uninspired and smudge-prone.. I'll give Meizu this: the MX 4-Core feels like a solid, refined piece of hardware from a strictly physical perspective. Even for something made of plastic, the seams on the MX feel tight, and the phone elicits almost no creaking or flex. Given its mid-range price, the MX 4-Core is the affirmation of something I've long hoped was true: even a relatively cheap phone doesn't have to feel cheap.. I think part of the reason for this is the fact that Meizu has chosen, like Apple - and that will not be the only time you read those words in this review - to stick with the same basic chassis for two generations. Meizu was able to take their time, and presumably refine the original MX's frame to a point where they have the manufacturing process down pat. Not only does this save on R&D costs, it means the second generation has various kinks and defects worked out (hopefully), allowing the product iteration to focus on internal hardware instead of marketing buzzwords like hyperglazing and wishy-washy new-age "nature" spew.. That isn't to say Meizu is all business and no fun with the MX, though. In fact, they have the coolest product packaging I've ever seen for a smartphone. The box itself is fairly Apple-y , all white, sliding open easily, with the power adapter carefully slotted into holes on its little cardboard pedestal. But then, you're confronted with what looks like a 200 page manual. When you pick it up, though, it's obviously not. Yes, Meizu has put the phone inside a fake book. The USB cable and cover removal tool are also hidden in the back of the book (a little too hidden, I couldn't find them at first). So, what starts out as Apple mimicry ends up being something a lot cooler - I kind of wish other smartphone makers would put some thought into this stuff.. The hardware buttons on the MX 4-Core are my least favorite part of the phone's physical attributes. The volume rocker is mushy, as is the power button. The hardware home button, though, gets a special place in my heart for annoyance. Instead of recessing it into the phone, Meizu made it stick out like a little trackball. Except that it isn't a trackball, and is made of very shiny and slippery plastic. This makes it less natural for your thumb to rest on, and harder to find when whipping the phone out of your pocket. Before I wrap up this section, I will say that the MX is decidedly smudge-prone. It's a shiny plastic phone, so this is something of a given. Oh, and the capacitive touch buttons are little LED lights that make shapes and change direction, look and be amazed:. Respectable and mostly smooth, with a barn-burner of a GPU.. The Exynos quad-core chip powering the MX 4-Core pushes Meizu's Flyme-covered version of Android 4.0.3 along with relative ease. Performance inside the OS is absolutely smooth. I did notice issues with 3rd-party apps, though. Some apps I know to work just fine on my One X were noticeably laggy on the MX 4-Core, and that can probably be chocked up to a combination of the phone's oddball resolution and a lack of optimization for its chipset (or perhaps the underlying software - I'm not sure). That said, these incidents were relatively few, and weren't so bad as to ruin the experience. Now, here are some benchmark scores:. This is a GPU-only test, so this is really only indicative of the Mali 400 GPU's performance. Quadrant is a holistic benchmark testing CPU, memory, and GPU performance. Vellamo is a benchmark suite measuring web performance. As you can see, the MX 4-Core holds its own, especially in the GLBenchmark GPU test. That makes sense, of course, given it has the same GPU as the Galaxy S III. And as always, remember that benchmarks should be taken with a very large grain of salt.. The definition of a "mixed bag.". When I'm using the MX 4-Core at my desk, the display is something I really don't notice. And for a mid-range smartphone, that's a good thing. I don't think about the resolution or brightness, or really even the colors. However, while we're on the subject, the MX 4-Core's LCD panel gets pretty bright, and the 288DPI is more than adequate given it's only four inches across. Colors are surprisingly good, and while not eye-poppingly-SAMOLED-vivid, are more accurate than many phones in this range. Reds don't look too hot, greens are a little dull (but I've seen worse), and yellows are yellow.. The viewing angles are perhaps the worst I've seen on any phone in recent memory, though. Color distortion is terrible at any sort of angle, and only gets worse the further you tilt the device. The other Achilles heel? Sunlight performance is downright bad. In combination with the very narrow viewing angle, seeing the display in bright daylight is a real challenge.. The resolution Meizu has chosen is simply a blatant grab at the iPhone. There's no reason to have a 640x960 Android phone unless you want to mimic the iconic proportions of Apple's smartphone when you plaster it up on a giant billboard, and given the look of the front of the MX, I think we all see what's going on there. The resolution, I think, also leads to other real usability problems, which I'll discuss later.. That quad-core processor is a hungry little guy.. Battery life on the MX 4-Core isn't what I'd call bad, but it's by no means very good. The 1700mAh cell (which you can see by removing the rear cover, but not actually swap out) provides a day of moderate to light usage, but put it under strain and it's clear that Meizu really hasn't worked out the power management on this thing. Even while idle and on Wi-Fi, the MX 4-Core exhibited an unusual amount of drain. There's little doubt in my mind that heavier users will be reaching for a charger by the late afternoon. You can, under the accessibility menu, set the CPU profile to a "low" mode, and this doesn't impact performance too much (that I noticed), but it didn't seem to improve battery life much, either.. An absolutely lamentable call quality experience.. Storage on the Meizu MX 4-Core clocks in at a very respectable 29.8GB usable on the base model. And while many may rejoice at the ample internal space, the lack of a microSD card slot may leave some wanting a little more room. The 64GB model, though, should keep even the biggest media junkie happy.. Wireless performance on the MX was solid. Wi-Fi speeds were very good, Bluetooth worked (though it's only 2.1), and GPS locks were pretty quick. Network speeds were what I'd expect given its HSPA+ 21Mbps rating.. Meizu picked the tiniest, crappiest little speaker it possibly could for the MX, and it basically makes phone calls happening anywhere but a graveyard or a church impossible to hear. I was in shock at just how bad it was. If you're picking up this phone, you need a Bluetooth headset or speakerphone. Parties on the other end had a bit of trouble hearing me, too, especially outdoors. I assume Meizu's logic here is that most people in China use Bluetooth earpieces, and it saved them a buck. The MX 4-Core's headphone audio is a very pleasant surprise.. The MX provides a surprisingly good audio experience from the headphone jack. It's plenty loud, fidelity is very good, and dynamic range seems strong. It's entirely possible this device is using the Wolfson DAC that is integrated with Samsung's Exynos chipset, and that's one of the best audio hubs out there for mobile devices right now. Here, the Meizu MX 4-Core gets great marks from me.. The external speaker, though, is much less satisfying. It sounds like a budget phone external speaker - loud, piercing, and hollow. You get what you pay for, I guess.. The camera on the MX 4-Core is... It provides very good macro performance for a phone camera, and the general sharpness of images, even at full zoom, is impressive. It's no Galaxy S III in that regard, but in terms of actually preserving the captured content's form, the MX 4-Core does a pretty good job. In fact, I'd say the level of detail matches my HTC One X. Even a hint of contrast or mixed lighting sends the MX 4-Core's rear shooter into full-on panic, washing out and overexposing all over the place.. Flyme OS's pretty looks quickly give way to its neutered functionality and various oddities.. And this is where it all falls apart. From a hardware standpoint, the Meizu MX 4-Core is a pretty great little phone. Unfortunately, Flyme OS really does ruin it, and in ways I just can't forgive.. Let's start with the positives, though. It really does look good, I love the lockscreen, the charging animation on the lockscreen, the expanded notification bar when you're on a homescreen, and the quick power controls when you pull it down. If only Meizu had just stopped there. They had to rewrite the Android book, and in doing so, have created some sort of one-armed iOS-Android mutant.. The app drawer? There isn't one. Yes, you can download a custom launcher, but you shouldn't have to. All your downloaded apps populate on the far right homescreen, and removing the shortcuts uninstalls them. Long-pressing on an empty area of a homescreen does nothing - just like iOS. You have to go to the Settings -> Customize menu to add widgets or change wallpaper. I'll stop with the iOS comparisons, because I'm sure you're getting the point by now.. Notifications have been inexplicably dumbed down - only a single bubble displays next to the signal icon showing an unread notification is in the pull down bar. There are no context-specific icons, either, just the stock dialogue bubble.. The stock keyboard is pretty awful, accuracy is mediocre and placement of keys is very odd, but that's understandable given that this phone is primarily meant for the Chinese market. It's easily replaced with something else.. One part of Android I love is context-sensitive volume controls, they're something that I really just can't live without. Meizu apparently doesn't agree, and just got rid of them altogether. The volume rocker only controls media volume, no matter what app you're in. Instead, a combination of either volume up or down and the power button toggle silent mode. They've actually managed to reduce the functionality of the OS here. That silent mode toggle requires 2 hands if you aren't going to accidentally turn off the screen, too. Notification volume is only controlled via the audio settings menu.. Battery stats has been removed from the settings menu. Android 4.0's native screenshot shortcut has been disabled (Meizu does not include an alternate method). The app management menu is gone, which means there is no way that I've found to clear app defaults without uninstalling the app. Unless it's a system app, then you're apparently screwed. The stock Android power widget has been removed, and the only way to adjust brightness is via the settings menu. Long-pressing the menu capacitive key for the recent apps menu pops up the settings dialogue in some third-party apps. Those neat party-trick capacitive touch buttons can have their brightness adjusted, but you can't make them vibrate. I could keep going on with all these little issues, but I don't really care to at this point. Let's get to the biggest one.. The system DPI is just set up wrong. I don't know if it's the aspect ratio of the 640x960 display, or just Meizu thinking we're all really nearsighted, but just look at this comparison of the amount of content my One X shows on screen versus the MX 4-Core, it's pathetic:. In the actual homescreen and system UI, everything looks fine on the Meizu. But on any 3rd party app, it's like the DPI goes into Playskool mode. The system DPI setting in the settings menu only has "Normal" and "Large," so there's no way to scale it back down. Because of this, using the MX 4-Core for basic tasks like email feels like going back to my Nexus One.. It's difficult for me to provide a comprehensive overview of Flyme, because at every turn it seems there is something wrong, or simply gone. There are features I could praise, like the partial-shade notification bar, or the beautiful lockscreen. But considering how much time talking about what Flyme OS lacks, and what's broken, these are hardly redeeming points.. The MX 4-Core really is like a Ford Pinto with a V10 engine. The almost laughable combination of a cutting-edge quad-core Exynos processor with the MX's unassuming plastic form factor and dumbed-down software experience makes for quite the odd couple. On the one hand, it definitely is fast (most of the time). But it's also a bit of a gas-guzzler, and Flyme OS's limitations and irregularities make it really hard to figure out just how to use all of that extra power in a meaningful way. A poor call quality experience and an abnormal display resolution don't help make the sale. Frankly, I'm not even sure what the point of a quad-core processor is in a phone like the MX - I'm guessing it has a lot more to do with marketing than megaflops.. In China, where the MX 4-Core will be a very aggressively-priced contender, Mr. Wong's phone may fare very well. And maybe, in that market, a lower cost of entry and homegrown status will continue to win Meizu even more fanfare. Unfortunately, the MX 4-Core just isn't ready to compete in a more cutthroat global smartphone space, where devices like the Galaxy S III, One X / S, and even the iPhone cost most subscribers very little up front.. Still, I look forward to what Meizu's next phone will bring. And I really hope it comes in a box shaped like a book..

Never used Flyme OS, but it reminds me a lot of MIUI. I actually had an M9 skin on MIUI long ago. The lack of an app drawer seems odd at first, but you get used to it like any other OS, while an option would be nice. I remember downloading a mod for MIUI to include an icon that acted as a drawer that could be dropped into the hot seat.. Yeah, I understand it's definitely a UI philosophy thing, but it seems silly on an Android phone given how much work Google puts into make it a central part of the experience, especially with the widgets drawer.. Personally, I've never really liked the app drawer on Android, and think the MIUI (and apparently Flyme) approach of having all your apps on your home screen together with the ability to add widgets on the home screen is the best of both Android and iOS.. The app drawer always becomes a total mess for me with all my apps and no ability to clean it up with folders, and going into the app drawer is just one more tap I need to do to get to an app.. Of course, the great thing about Android is I can just install a launcher I like, and get things just how I like them..

Of course, the great thing about Android is I can just install a launcher I like, and get things just how I like them.. Firstly,I should recommend myself ，I come from china. it reminds me a lot of MIUI " I should let you know,In china, most people knew that Miui copy from flymeos.but miui did it better, （I'm sorry for my poor English）. Before the Mi-One came out (MIUI was just a ROM then), there was a rumour that Wong and the guy behind MIUI were supposedly best friends at one point. They wanted to make a phone with a UI that could take on the iPhoney but ended up having a fight and went their separate ways. That's probably one of the reasons Flyme looks like MIUI. Having the Mi-One actually come out and onto the market made it that little bit more believable.. first thought on reading the title "so you can be going super fast when you explode".. In the specs and mentioned again later in the review, shouldn't it be 4412 not 4212?. So, has Apple sued them yet?. Stock Android would've been a better idea.. They'll get away with it for awhile.. Dropped a v8 in a pontiac sunbird ( a lifetime ago). Love the packaging - that's probably the best thing about this phone. Outside of the orientation-aware buttons, that's pretty cool too, though that wouldn't even be in the picture had they used all software buttons.. Am I the only person who actually likes MIUI (Flyme OS) interface. It is a shameless ripoff from IOS but it is very smooth and looks really nice. You can complete change any part of the interface, for example when I had MIUI installed my interface looked as a mix of ICS and Windows Phone 7. I know I'm replying 2 months later but I cant help it: Flyme OS =/= MIUI! MIUI is awesome and doesn't have the weird limitations mentioned in this review, except the lack of an app drawer.. Still wish I'd won one in the contest.. Actually, you can buy a One X off-contract at most electronic markets in China for around 3200-2500 RMB (Granted, you'll never manage to RMA those with the OEM though).. .and the 288DPI is more than adequate given it's only four inches across."Just something I wanted to point out, DPI is a function of resolution and screen size. As such, this doesn't really make sense.. you can set the CPU from normal (1GHz) to fast (1.4GHz). this gives me a quadrant score of 5163 leaving the one x far behind :-). the only issue with flyme os is the folders which is limited to a page (which covers the screen) other than that. plus it has one of the best sound on a phone....

Chinese phone-maker Meizu today unveiled its newest flagship smartphone, the MX4. After years of pricing its flagship at around the US$400 mark, Meizu is this time slashing the price-tag in an apparent attempt to compete with Xiaomi.. Flyme 4.0 base on Android 4.4 OS.

A Sound Smartphone: The Meizu MX 4-Core. You may remember Meizu as the maker of the classic M6 portable audio player. When it was first released way back in 2006, the portable audio landscape was a very different place. I recall having a hard time choosing between the iPod 5th gen and the Creative Zen Vision:M, both of which were clunky, chunky little bricks with 30GB of storage provided by a miniature hard drive. Then along came Meizu with their M6 player: it was cheaper, smaller, and used flash based memory which made for less storage capacity but more reliability. Yes, there were some other micro-sized competitors, but none really spoke to me like the little M6 could. The key to the whole thing was the excellent sound quality which I thought was a cut above the rest. It certainly helped to offer native FLAC support and a useful 10-band EQ, both of which were very uncommon features at the time.. Formerly big players (Creative and iRiver, for example) have long been rendered irrelevant, and the entire DAP concept has largely been swallowed up by overachieving smartphones. There are a few outliers: the iPod Classic limps along as the main choice for big storage on the go. Cowon is still in the game, though very hit and miss. Sony sells a few here and there. As a whole though, the market seems accurately summarized by Apple's treatment of the iPod Touch. Yes, they keep coming out with new versions, but always a step behind the iPhone, as if to say "I matter, but not much".. It is in this climate that Meizu chose to switch gears from portable players (a few of which they still offer) to smartphones. Not just any smartphones, but high-end devices that could compete with the latest and greatest from major players such as Samsung and HTC. They had some success with their Meizu MX which launched early this year. Meizu followed up quickly with the MX 4-core, an evolution of the original MX rather than a revolution.. Meizu is based in China where they are very popular. They even have their own "Meizu Store" locations throughout mainland China, and a recently opened flagship store in Hong Kong indicates their desire to expand. I'm told that the launch of the MX and MX 4-core devices were accompanied by Apple-esque long lines on launch day. While most of our readers can't just walk into a store and buy the MX 4-core, it can be ordered online and will work with many carriers (T-Mobile and AT&T for example). The price translates to roughly $470 for the 32GB version and $630 for the 64GB, though as a current hot seller I've seen prices climb a bit higher.. I can already see the puzzled looks on the faces of InnerFidelity readers. Since when do we cover smartphones? Sure, I did a piece on the Samsung Galaxy Player 5, but that was a dedicated media player with no phone capabilities. There already exists dozens of phone-related websites, with comprehensive reviews covering each new phone as it gets released. So why a phone, and why this particular model from a relatively obscure company?. Simply put: InnerFidelity is interested in "personal audio". It doesn't get much more personal then your cell phone, which travels with you everywhere you go. But many phones, especially those running Android, have rather poor audio quality. Some phone review sites cover audio quality to a very limited degree, and I've even seen one break out the RMAA measurements (with all the flaws that entails). None of them really go into much detail, and I'm certain none of them have multiple $1,000+ headphones and custom in ear monitors with which to listen. So while InnerFidelity will probably never do a 10 page article covering every aspect of a smartphone, we will occasionally cover relevant devices with an eye (and ear) towards audio quality---especially in cases like this where it really is worth talking about.. The smartphone industry is a fickle, ever-evolving beast. What starts off as an ultra-fast, top-of-the-line device can be overshadowed by competitors in a short amount of time. To minimize that effect, companies tend to push their product to market as quickly as possible, though sometimes that still isn't enough. We see this in action with the MX 4-core---first announced in mid-April and already released in June. It has very strong specs and earns bragging rights as being one of the first phones available with a quad-core processor, a distinction that diminishes rapidly as more quad-core devices are launched.. Specifics: the MX-Quad is an unlocked pentaband GSM phone meaning it will work with pretty much any carrier that provides a SIM card. It uses the quad-core Exynos 4412 chipset running at 1.4GHz per core (with options to underclock if desired). It has 1GB RAM and is available with either 32GB or 64GB of storage. The screen is a 4-inch ASV display with a 960 x 640 resolution and a pixel density of 292ppi. It features an 8MP camera with LED flash that can also do 1080p video at 30fps. It had a recent update and now runs Android version 4.0.3 (aka Ice Cream Sandwich in Android-speak) with Meizu's proprietary Flyme OS overlaying the stock Android experience. It has all the expected features that a current smartphone should have: GPS, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. The only potential weak spot is the lack of 4G LTE data capabilities. It does feature HSPA+ which is nearly as fast (and is sometimes misleadingly labeled as 4G anyway).. Running PassMark (a synthetic benchmark app) shows the 4-core consistently near the top of the performance rankings compared to other devices. In the instances where it is out-performed, the difference is not substantial. This translates to a fast user experience where apps launch quickly, pages scroll smoothly, and everything is generally snappy.. All this powerful hardware is great, but what about the audio? Meizu has that covered as well. The MX 4-core uses a Wolfson WM8958 CODEC for audio duty. This highly integrated chip features a quality DAC (100dB SNR), 5-band hardware parametric EQ, and an integrated "Class W" headphone driver. Wolfson describes their Class W technology as being an evolution of class G and class H, featuring an adaptive dual drive charge pump and DC servo. The design balances high quality with low power consumption , and is optimized to share noisy power supply rails without compromising performance due to excellent PSRR.. Merely using good hardware does not guarantee results. Those familiar with the original Samsung Galaxy S may recall how the hardware was very nice but got hobbled by the stock software. Users could root their devices and install a 3rd party Kernel which unleashed the full potential of the hardware. Meizu seems to have taken great care to avoid those limitations right from the start. For example, some phones (Galaxy Nexus among others) use a CODEC that can only accept 48kHz signals, forcing software to resample everything at that rate. Since most music is native 44.1kHz, almost everything ends up being manipulated in this way, at the expense of some fidelity. Meizu plays 44.1kHz tracks at their native rate so no extraneous processing takes place. Tracks with higher sample rates do get automatically reduced to 44.1kHz.. So far this thing sounds pretty impressive---but I've actually saved the best for last. In the past, I've lamented how there are very few portable devices that can supply a digital signal to feed a quality portable DAC/amp unit like the Leckerton UHA-6S. Meizu comes to the rescue with support for SPDIF output. Unfortunately there is simply no room for a dedicated jack, so Meizu did the next best thing---MHL output through the microUSB port. MHL is actually an industry standard that supports HD video and digital audio out, and is typically used for connecting a smartphone to a display (using an MHL to HDMI cable). The Meizu MX is the first and only device I've seen that also does SPDIF audio. There's an option in the settings menu to enable this output, and it requires an adapter to interface with a coaxial SPDIF cable.. Meizu hasn't quite finalized their plans for this adapter. For now I'm using an engineering sample of a breakout board based on the Prolific PL-2303X USB to serial bridge controller. Keep in mind that this is not converting USB to SPDIF but rather controlling the native data that already exists in the MHL output. This sample board has a microUSB connection that plugs into the phone itself, 3 miniUSB ports, and a coaxial SPDIF port. It's small enough to where I have carried it around with the phone and the Leckerton as a portable rig, but of course there's room make it smaller by ditching a lot of those ports on the final version. I imagine Meizu could do a typical home dock with HDMI, SPDIF, and analog audio outputs, and then also a small inline cable with just SPDIF to be used in a portable setup.. The best part about this output is that it spits out bit-perfect data. I've tested it with various DACs and they all confirm that the Meizu plays back an unaltered stream, ranging from 16-bit/44.1kHz CD standard tracks to 24-bit/192kHz hi-res material and everything in between.. Can you tell so far that this thing is very promising? Read on to find out how it lives up to its potential.... NEXT: Page 2 ». 610 Nathan Road, Mongkok, Kowloon, Hong Kong.

I wonder if the dual core version of this phone uses the same (bad according to various sources) Yamaha DAC from the Samsung Galaxy S2, if you look at the gsmarena review:. You can se that THD and IMD are considerably worse, than on the 4 core version. Just a thought because the 4 core Version, uses the Samsung Exynos, and the SGS3 has good sound, and the SGS2 with 2 core Exynos has bad sound.. will ask meizu about it, see if they respond.. Log in or register to post comments. Submitted by John Grandberg on September 22, 2012 - 9:03am. It seems to use the same Wolfson chip as the 4-core: LINK. It must be some type of optimization taking place to make the 4-core perform so well. Maybe similar to the camera - it somehow got a lot better from the MX to the MX 4-core, even though it seems to be the same hardware (or at least very similar).. I can't figure out the Samsung Galaxy S III - the USA version has more RAM than the International models, but only a dual core instead of quad core CPU, and a different (supposedly inferior) audio core as well? Weird.. Log in or register to post comments. Submitted by Can Crazy on September 24, 2012 - 1:14pm. Too bad that we still have to settle for buying a smartphone for a pretty big sum of money to get a minimumly decent sound on the go. If the objective was listening to music things could easily get soo much better. A pity Apple hasn't understood this and made a better effort with their iPods yet, as it's not an uninteresting market niche at all.. Log in or register to post comments. Submitted by Bennyboy on September 25, 2012 - 2:45am. My international Samsung Galaxy S3 has a 24 bit Wolfson DAC chip and outputs direct digital audio too. Not that I bother with that, because it sounds so fantastic anyway, and I think portable audio gear. with amps and external DAC add-ons is a bit extreme and ridiculous really.. Just my S3 and some cracking iems will do me.. Oh, and Poweramp is ok but Neutron is a damn sight better for audiophille sound - seriously, the flat setting is amazing, and with 64 bit processing and advanced resampling, not to mention parametric EQ, its a killer. UI is not as pretty as others, granted, but its perfectly fine.. Log in or register to post comments. Submitted by John Grandberg on September 25, 2012 - 7:01am. The international S3 version does look nice. Why Samsung messed with the specs for the USA model, I'll never understand.. Using the OTG cable will get you USB Host capabilities to connect to an external DAC. You might not want to use that while on the go, but it could be great if you also use a bigger home system. The Meizu MX 4-core should also be able to do USB connectivity in the same way, though I don't have the cable to test that myself. I still think the option Meizu has for coax SPDIF out is superior though - not all USB DACs will "talk" to the S3.. I like Neutron too but honestly it doesn't sound any better to me than Poweramp. And the interface seems lacking at the moment.... but the app does have potential.. Log in or register to post comments. The US model of the s3 does't. Submitted by E3SEL on September 27, 2012 - 2:27pm. The US model of the s3 doesn't have the same specs as the international s3 because the quad core exynos did not support 4g LTE. They instead used a dual core krait processor, which is basically as good because it is based on newer architecture, and it supports 4g LTE.. Log in or register to post comments. Still needs work as a cellphone. Submitted by grokit on September 30, 2012 - 2:55pm. Only problems, it doesn't work properly. It has a lot of connectivity issues. Poor reception bluetooth issues as well. Landscape mode too slow to pick up. Stock music player way too intrusive. Always comes in when there is no connection if you are listening to pandora or google music player. for tech support you have to send it back to main land China or Hong Kong.". Log in or register to post comments. Submitted by John Grandberg on October 1, 2012 - 8:55am. I didn't cover this in the main review because I didn't find it very relevant, but I did use the 4-core as a phone. My main wireless carrier uses CDMA so I just purchased a cheap AT&T pre-paid microSIM card and had my Google Voice number forward to the 4-core. It did just fine for me - bluetooth paired reliably, and reception was as good as I remember AT&T being. WiFi actually gets great reception, even working in dead spots around the house where my iPad2 doesn't.. The switch to landscape mode (and back again) seems to be deliberately delayed, to avoid accidental/unwanted switching. I don't think it is really lag because the delay is always the same even under heavy CPU load. I personally like the way they do it but I can see why someone would complain.. About the stock player - I don't use Pandora or Google Music much, so those could have a legit issue. For MOG and Spotify and Rdio the stock player doesn't launch.. So in summary, my experience has been different than that of the single Amazon reviewer, and I'd be happy to use this as a dedicated phone.. Log in or register to post comments. Submitted by BBEG on October 26, 2012 - 12:55pm. This article has been stuck in my head for the better part of a month now and brings to mind two main questions I'm hoping the author could answer.. First, sampling rate: "Meizu plays 44.1kHz tracks at their native rate so no extraneous processing takes place." Do you know if this is a hardware property or something native to the Flyme OS itself? I ask because there is a good chance I would be flashing Jelly Bean onto my next phone to stay current on Android, but I'm wary about doing this on the Meizu because I'm not sure how the audio is actually being handled.. Second, SPDIF output: "The Meizu MX is the first and only device I've seen that also does SPDIF audio. There's an option in the settings menu to enable this output, and it requires an adapter to interface with a coaxial SPDIF cable." If you guys still have the adapter, is it possible for you to test to see if it work on, say, an S3? I ask because both the Meizu and S3 are OTG-ready and support MHL. It would be interesting if you could use a small SPDIF adapter to connect more common flagship smartphones (like the S3) to more stubborn external DAC's (E17, who uses a slightly less than standard USB).. Log in or register to post comments. Submitted by John Grandberg on October 26, 2012 - 6:31pm. The sample rate question (#1) is probably a function of the software. But I don't know if it is built-in to Flyme, or if it is some other low level functionality. You could email Meizu to ask - they were very helpful and knowledgable when I had questions.. As for the SPDIF adapter - I somehow doubt it would work with an S3, simply because it isn't supported by the software on that model. With the Meizu, it didn't initially work either (which confused me at first). I had to go into settings and find "SPDIF output" and switch it to "on". The S3 would have no way to do that.. If I can get my hands on an S3 anytime soon, I'll give it a try just to see what happens. I also intend to try the S3 cable for USB out, to see if the Meizu can handle digital out through that method as well.. Log in or register to post comments. Submitted by BBEG on November 10, 2012 - 9:05am. Flyme has now been ported to the Galaxy S2, which is also a USB OTG device with MHL support.. If anyone has an S2 and feels like playing, they could see if the SPDIF audio output exists in the port. It would be very interesting to see if the SPDIF audio is a software capability vs a hardware capability (although I'd bet it still requires a MHL-capable USB port)..

Only problem is that my Bluetooth can only receive calls, it will not voice dial to make calls.. I tried with three different Bluetoth earpieces, none prompt me to speak when I press the button on the earpiece like they should.. I have been told that both Gingerbread and ICS support bluetooth voicedialing.. Is this an update/system issue, a defective phone, or is this phone not capable of what my old Motorola Razor (about 5 years old now) could do?. Any advice is appreciated as Bluetooth connectivity for voicedialing thru my earpiece is a necessity and I'd hate to have to return the phone.. Log in or register to post comments. Submitted by Corpsemaker on March 23, 2013 - 6:58pm. I was just wondering, after randomly bumping to this article and even reading the wikipedia one, it seems that even after many years of hardware development, the Nokia N91 could be the holy grail of portable players(sans dedicated amp), yeah, it seems it's "smooth" sounding, but still packing an "audiophile" punch. I would be interested if someone could share some information, or even conduct some testing if possible... John, Tyll, any of you two have some say?. Log in or register to post comments.

No, I can't seem to find any official release of the adapter for digital output. Seems a shame since they clearly had intentions to release it.

Jul 04 AT 1:10 PM. Nick is a tech enthusiast who has a soft spot for HTC and its devices. Nick joined the Android and Me family in the summer of 2010. Tagged # Android 4.0 # cortex-a9 # Exynos # first impressions # Flyme # Ice Cream Sandwich # Meizu # MEIZU MX 4-Core # popular # unboxing. While most of us are fussing over the new Samsung Galaxy S III or the HTC One series, MEIZU has released the MX 4-Core. As the name implies, the Android 4.0.3 handset features a quad-core processor – the same 1.4GHz Exynos Cortex A9 chipset found in the European version of the Samsung Galaxy S III. While the insides of the MEIZU MX 4-Core may be in step with the latest and greatest Android phones, the handset design is reminiscent of the iPhone with a single hardware button on the front of the device and a minimalistic flare which brings back memories of the iPhone 3G.. The first thing that stands out with the MEIZU MX 4-Core is its packaging. MEIZU has given the device a premium white box which reflects the handsets sophisticated feel. Inside the box, the phone is enclosed in a small booklet with several heavy pages which highlights the features of the handset. It’s definitely a step up from the packaging of most carrier-branded handsets and even puts Samsung and HTC’s unlocked handset packaging to shame.. MEIZU MX 4-Core’s hardware is reminiscent of the iPhone. While most of us at Android and Me are not huge fans of Apple’s flagship device, we’re sure you can agree that Apple does have a flare for. design which isn’t often seen on Android phones. MX 4-Core is a two-toned device with a pure black panel surrounding the screen on the front and a removable white casing which wraps around the sides and back of the device. Underneath the back panel, users have access to the microSIM card, but the 1,700 mAh battery and 32GB of internal storage are not swappable. MX 4-Core features three buttons (power button long the top edge, volume rocker on the left edge and a raised home which is located below the display. To the left and right of the home button are two capacitive buttons which are accentuated by LED lights which also serve as notification LEDs.. Spec highlights on the MEIZU MX 4-Core include a 4-inch 640×960 display, Exynos 1.4GHz quad-core Cortex A9 processor, 1GB of RAM, 32GB or 64GB of internal storage 8MP camera with BSI sensor, 1080p video recording and a 1700 mAh battery which appears to hold enough of a charge to make it through a day of moderate use. having a good spec sheet is nice, but MEIZU has decided to beef the MX 4-Core up as much as possible by enabling. 9 GSM frequency bands on the device (2G 850/900/1800/1900MHz 3G: 850/900/1700/1900/2100MHZ) making other global roaming enabled devices look like play toys. Testing the MEIZU MX 4-Core on T-Mobile and AT&T’s HSPA+ networks produced results averaging 1700kbps down with upload speeds. reaching 500kbps on a good run.. On the performance side, the MEIZU MX 4-Core doesn’t disappoint. Exynos Cortex A9 processor is paired with a Mali-400mp GPU, giving the handset enough power to breeze through multiple benchmarks. So far, we’ve used the MX 4-Core to play Final Fantasy III (which it handled without breaking a sweat), but we’ll do our best to find a few games to push it to its limits for our full review.. Though the look of the phone may be iPhone-ish, the MEIZU MX 4-Core is an Android device with its own unique personality. The MX 4-Core is the first device in MEIZU’s lineup to run Flyme, a custom skin which deviates significantly from stock Android. Those of you familiar with MIUI will notice a few similarities between the two UI’s since both do away with the application drawer and force users to actively manage and organize their applications within folders on multiple home screen panels. Having used MIUI ROMs on my T-Mobile G2 for nearly a year, the Flyme UI on the. MEIZU MX 4-Core has not presented too many challenges for me.. The one quirk about the MX 4-Core which is taking a while to get used to is the. The resolution and viewing angles are amazing, but the 14×9 aspect ratio just feels odd since most high-end Android devices have been using 16×9 setups for a few years now.. So far, the MEIZU MX 4-Core has been an impressive device.. The quad-core Exynos processor keeps the OS nice and snappy, and network. fast and reliable on AT&T and T-Mobile. The MEIZU MX 4-Core may not be. on most consumer’s radars, but it can certainly keep up with the latest flagship devices from HTC and Samsung. If you have any questions about something I didn’t cover, feel free to ask in the comments. to a full review of the MEIZU MX 4-Core in the next few weeks.. Would any of you consider buying the MX 4-Core?. I thought that was an iPhone in the screen cap for the article.. I wonder if the cease and desist from Apple is already in the mail?. that top and bottom bezel is just a little to iph-ish…... I really doubt Apple would waste their time or money. Unlike Samsung, MEIZU isn’t really much of a competitor.. Apple doesn’t really care about the size of the company, when it comes to their IPs (imaginary or otherwise) they will act when they take notice.. There have been plenty cases regarding much smaller companies.. were they chinese companies? I have to side with R.S, apple probably isn’t going to do anything. they take legal action with ridiculous patent claims when they know a win is plausible and when it will hurt their competitor. but this? they aren’t likely to win, and it’s hardly worth fighting over.. small chinese tech manufacturers make blatant knock-offs all of the time, including apple knock offs. If an american carrier sold this phone, then I definitely think it would get banned, but as a chinese import with completely negligible overseas market penetration, I doubt it. While i am no fan of apple, this phone has sue me written all over it.. Going to to be very difficult for Apple to bring any case against them unless Meizu starts formally selling their device in the States through a carrier.. And even if they did, you can’t patent something as simple as the “look” of a device. Sure, the front looks an awful lot like in iphone. But it’s really just a rectangular screen with two large bezels at the top and bottom. Are you kidding? The whole basis of the Galaxy Tab suit are the style similarities, which is completely idiotic. Judge Koh either has a spare chromosome or is on the take from Apple to approve that injunction. I do agree with your other point. I don’t think Apple with sue a Chinese company in China.. Nice of you to review such a phone. Maybe you’ll get the other prototypes as well :). “The MX 4-Core is the first device in MEIZU’s lineup to run Flyme”. I don’t believe its the first one to one Flyme I believe that would be the Meizu M8 (:. First with Flyme would be M9.. Who cares??? LOL The MX 6-Core will the first to run Slyme with an exclusive Ghost Busters Skin. You are correct, several other MEIZU phones received updated in May and June with the new UI. The MX 4-Core is the first new device to ship with it pre-installed.. BTW there was an option to change the text to English in the top dropsown box :/. The anti-plastic nazis are going to have a heart attack over this... Now why can’t apple ban this phone instead of the Nexus? As far as I know most android phones have universal search, not just the GNex. Apple isn’t banning this phone because it’s technically not being sold inside the United States. On the issue of the galaxy Nexus ban, apple is perusing other OEMs for the same patent infringement.. Specs are great but why make it look like… you know…. The frequency bands are the same as the GSM Galaxy Nexus. Except that there are very few devices which support all those frequency bands. Most unlocked GSM handsets do not feature connectivity for T-Mobile’s HSPA+ network.. Because of the T-mobile support I think my GF might actually buy this phone.. We looked it over while in hong kong and thought that it was actually fairly nice for the price. She wanted one, but at that time the current one didn’t support T-mobile’s 3g/4g.. Thanks for the article, would never have known they added support.. One thing that might help me decide… price? I presume to get one currently you have to go through an overseas reseller – so what would that cost? Or are you hoping they might find a US distributor so that sticker shock doesn’t cause an immediate recoil for most folks?. Nice phone, but it isn’t for me at least.. Ok…so are we going to ever actually see this phone in the states??? Are any carriers planning on offering it? I don’t mean to complain but I hate whenever I see a review for a phone that I’m never going to actually have a chance at owning unless if I’m willing to spend $600+ through some overseas retailer. And honestly, there’s no way I’ll ever spend that kind of money on a device unless if I can walk into an actual store and try it out in person. Keep in mind that we have quite a few readers from Europe and Asia who read this site. While we focus a lot on devices that are sold in the U.S. market, it’s interesting to get a different perspective and see what other people around the globe may be using.. Lets not forget that buying an unlocked phone from Europe or China for $500 is probably cheaper than getting a $200 phone from your carrier.. I will probably never get this phone but it’s always better to know you options and make an informed decision.. Would never buy a phone that looked like an ugly iPhone. Hate the design and i think it looks old and dated, something i have thought since they first came out.. Prices for this phone in Hong Kong are more than reasonable: $400/32gb and $530/64gb, but ordering it through a 3rd party reseller is going to drastically alter that equation. The photos don’t show the lighted touch-sensitive keys flanking the home button, which add a bit of useful flair to the design. Beyond useful flair, the lights on the keys change according to the menu and rotate according to the orientation of the phone.. I actually considered this phone over the SGS3 when ditching VZW to go to T-Mobile but I ruled it out for three reasons:. 1) Dev and accessory support just wouldn’t be the same as with the SGS3. 2) I likes me my big screens and correspondingly high resolutions. 3) I didn’t think this phone supported T-Mobile’s bands.. I was clearly wrong about point #3. Kudos to them for supporting so many different bands! I really would love to try this phone. That said, the other two points just can convince me to give up a SGS3 for this phone. Jealous of the quad core but not much else since it’s all a step behind the (dual core/2GB) SGS3 in pretty much every other category.. why didnt they make it compatible for 4G usage? most phones are 4g now so browsing speed on this device will began to seem extremely slow in a few months correct?. If you’re referring to LTE, MEIZU most likely didn’t include it because they would have had to use a different chip just like Samsung is doing for their U.S. correct, i am referring to lte. well do you think its wortg getting being that it isnt going to be lte compatible? or do you think data speeds will still be very fast?. I might put in an order for this phone as I have wanted to try a Meizu phone for quite some time.. How about we all from AndroidAndMe sue Meizu it if Apple will not. C’mon it’s your chance to be a millionaire!. Should i find the lawyer? Let me know. Spec’s look really good yet it looks too much like an iphone for my taste. I could overlook it if it came stock Android instead of a custom skin.. I’m using MX 2-core with AT&T. Well, at least in my hand it does not look like an iPhone, color, size, none.. The display is actually really nice, it’s simply an odd aspect ratio for a screen of this size.. If they had this for Sprint CDMA, I would so buy it.. “but the 1,700 mAh battery and 32GB of internal storage are not swappable.”. personally i dont see a need for more then 32gb of storage, especially with Google Drive, Pandora, Google Play Music, Dropbox and the countless other cloud storage solutions for those not on unlimited it may not always be the best option but really where not talking about our PCs a phone doesnt need 100gbs of storage, when most apps dont take up gbs of space, I could understand if this was like the Asus Padfone and the phone powered all of our other devices but come on now you dont need 30 gb of music or videos on your phone. where can i buy this in the uk?. OrientDealcom have pressed new Goopad Mini, a perfectl iPad Mini Alternative. a dual core 8 inch Mini tablet pc with the latest android 4.1 OS can Go with Google Play(equal to App store of Apple), it have the same 1024*768 resolution as iPad Mini, a better Dual Core 1.6Ghz CPU.

'Papers, Please' official short film recreates the game's bleak tone. The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Meizu MX 4-core and Flyme OS 1.0 formally announced, available on June 30th. Meizu MX 4-core and Flyme OS 1.0 formally announced, available on June 30th. Forget that "MX Quad-core" moniker, because Meizu's just formally introduced its first quad-core Android phone as the "MX 4-core" in Hong Kong. For those who care, this is the first time ever for Meizu to collaborate with a carrier -- that being Hong Kong's PCCW, who's offering the HK$3,099 (US$400) 32GB model for free on various tariffs, while details are light on the HK$4,099 (US$530) 64GB version. Once the stage cleared we had a chance to take a closer look at the international variant of the MX 4-core. Aside from the disappearance of the Chinese logo above the screen plus the duller logo on the back (but accompanied by an extra capacity label), the 4-inch HSPA+ phone looks identical to its dual-core sibling. Additionally, Hong Kong and mainland China customers who pre-order between now and the launch on June 30th will get to pick a colored back crystal shell for free, including ivory white, milky lime, lilac purple and misty pink to replace the original white.. Software-wise Flyme -- Meizu's heavily customized Ice Cream Sandwich -- is also very similar to its Gingerbread predecessor, except for its slicker responsiveness (especially the camera app) and the odd interface tweaks here and there. There are also a few new features that are worth a mention: on top of the new native stopwatch, countdown timer and multi-segmented timed task lists, there's Flyme Voicemail which is essentially a native recorder for incoming calls that you reject (think of it as a neat alternative to conventional visual voicemail), and there's Flyme Message which is Meizu's take on SIP services like Whatsapp and Line. We shall dig deeper in our full review, but for now, you can check out a quick hands-on video after the break. And for those who still possess Meizu's older Android phones, we were told to expect Flyme to be delivered over the air in early July (as opposed to the original June date), so keep an eye out for that little update icon.. Update: We mentioned in our video that the China version of the MX 4-core doesn't come with the Play Store, but it turns out that we were mistaken. Update 2: By the way, it's pronounced "fly-me.".

A Sound Smartphone: The Meizu MX 4-Core Page 2. My first thought upon unboxing the device was that Meizu has gone too far in their iPhone "emulation". But closer inspection reveals the similarities to be merely surface level. The actual feel of the unit, the textures, the unique interactive buttons, give the MX 4-core enough character of its own. I especially like the 4-inch display---colors are bright, text is crisp, and the whole thing feels like a good compromise in terms of size. It's appreciably bigger than a 3.5" iPhone display, yet allows the phone to maintain a manageable size overall. As much as I love a big screen like the 4.7" display on the HTC One X, that sort of device is not something I would lug around on a daily basis.. I'm not going to go too far in depth about Meizu's Flyme OS---I'll leave that to the dedicated phone sites. In brief, it reminds me of a cross between the flexibility of Android and the polish of iOS, and I rather enjoy it. It runs smoothly and quickly and I experienced very few hiccups along the way.. I am impressed by the included media player apps---separate programs for video and audio. I don't watch a lot of video but I appreciate the capabilities of the player since it can seemingly play anything you might throw at it, including .mkv format. Even huge 1080p files load quickly and seamlessly.. The standard audio player is definitely the best I've seen, and I often prefer using it over Poweramp (which is normally my go-to music app for Android). It plays FLAC files (along with most other formats), even hi-resolution tracks, without hesitation. It's simple and quick to use but also powerful enough for more advanced tasks such as on-the-go playlist creation/editing. Downsides? It doesn't do gapless playback, and the onboard 5-band EQ is terrible (which is strange because it should be handled in hardware by the WM8958). Poweramp fixes both of those problems but tops out at 24/96. With many Android phones I've used, Poweramp has a clear edge in sound quality, but in this case the stock player is just as good.. Wow! Look at that bit rate!. So how does this thing sound? In a word, excellent. It easily ranks among the best sound I've heard from a portable device (not including dedicated portable amps). Sound is crisp and clear with nice low frequency extension and sparkly but not overly-bright highs. I really dig the natural tonality which seems more like what I'm used to from my home gear than my portable gear. I hear definite improvement over my current LG Android phone as well as numerous other phones and tablets I've used.. Something that generally remains elusive with Android devices is a black background. The worst offenders have audible hiss and hash, especially when background operations are being executed. I've heard some that do pretty well but still don't have that inky blackness that accompanies better audio gear. The Meizu MX 4-core is dead silent. It does better than my previous benchmark, the iPad 2, though the difference is fairly small on most headphones. But when I use ultra-efficient custom in-ear monitors for this test---specifically the Lear LCM-5 (a torture test using 5 balanced-armature drivers per side, rated at 122dB for 1mW of power at 1kHz)---the improvement becomes apparent.. The headphone jack has an output impedance of 3.2 ohms which is just slightly higher than ideal. To achieve the recommended damping factor of 8, the 4-core is best paired with headphones having a 25 ohm impedance or higher. That makes it safe for most full sized headphones, including the relatively low impedance 25 ohm Denon D7000 and brethren. There are some IEMs, mostly of the dynamic driver variety, that go a bit lower than that--- Monster Turbine Pro Copper and HiFiMAN RE-272 for example. I tried both of those with the 4-core and didn't notice any particular deficiency. The bigger problem would be something like the Phonak PFE232 which has an impedance above 40 ohms but then dips into the mid teens around 10kHz. Even so, I only caught the slightest glimpse of a small "notch" in the highs, and they still sounded very good overall.. Musical examples: the MX 4-core seems well suited to a wide variety of music. Diana Krall's album "Quiet Nights" sounds beautiful, as usual---there's a reason her music is in regular rotation at hi-end audio salons and shows. Honestly that sort of thing is hard to get wrong. But the MX 4-core does a great job with "normal" quality recordings as well. "ObZen" by Swedish Metal band Meshuggah demands speed and clarity, and the 4-core really delivers, while at the same time capturing the intoxicating vocals of singer Chhom Nimol's voice on Dengue Fever's latest album "Cannibal Courtship". "The Joker" from Steve Miller Band's classic album of the same name helps demonstrate just how punchy and accurate the 4-core can be in the lower registers, where it really nails the thud of the kick drum. Listening to "Eet" from Regina Spektor's album "Far"---her typically ambiguous vocals (bonus points for mentioning headphones!) sound very lively and somewhat more forward than neutral. I get the same impression from Jack Steadman's vocals on the Bombay Bicycle Club album "Flaws"---very sparkly and articulate while mostly avoiding sibilance. Still, little things like this make me feel that the Meizu isn't the perfect match for overly bright headphones. I'd classify this more as a bit of character rather than a significant coloration though.. Is it perfect? Of course not. Whith the Leckerton UHA-6S on DAC/amp duty, I noticed an increased sense of ease to the music, with no sacrifice in detail or clarity. For example---"Haze" from Hiromi's latest album "Voice" is a very difficult track to render properly, thanks to the blindingly complex piano work. The 4-core does an admirable job but at times seems to lose pace which results in a sort of blurry presentation. Adding the Leckerton to the mix, the notes are rendered with more precision. Still, the 4-core gives a valiant effort, better than any smartphone I've tried.. Adding the amp also resulted in more drive for full sized headphones---the 4-core can ably handle things like the VMODA M80 or Beyer DT1350, but is not as comfortable with the AKG K701 or planar-magnetic headphones. But I wouldn't expect it to be perfect with those anyway. It is a phone after all. All in all I'm still very impressed with the overall performance when used within the normal scope of a device like this.. I did notice a quirk with regards to hi-resolution music. Different sample rates gave me different results---24/192 material played back through the native music app had some type of minor background noise, likely an artifact from downsampling. It ended up sounding like tiny pops and clicks. I played the 24/192 version of "Hotel California" and it sounded roughly like vinyl---great sound overall but with an imperfect noise floor. Definitely still listenable and hard to notice with most songs. My biggest problem example came from 24/48 material, which in my collection is mostly from the B&W Society of Sound releases. Cara Dillon's "Live at the Grand Opera House" is a perfect example. Her voice, usually beautiful and smooth, had some digital "hash" to it, giving her a unique type of sibilance. I don't mean a vague audiophile deficiency... more like a very obvious "What's wrong with her voice?" type of thing. Charlie Winston's "Passport" had the same issue. "Manic Depression" by CBW, and "Georgia On My Mind" by Oscar Peterson, both sounded free of any obvious artifacts.. I asked Meizu for their best guess as to what might be causing this. They speculate that it has to do with the higher sample rates: recall that these must be converted to 44.1kHz on the fly. Apparently Android has different "levels" of software resampling and Meizu is not using the highest possible level at present. This could be changed in future firmware updates assuming the demand is there. Keep in mind that this issue has no bearing on the SPDIF output, which remains bit-perfect at all resolutions.. The Meizu MX 4-core is an excellent portable music reproduction device---one of the best I've heard. It also seems to me to be a really nice smartphone. But I'm not really focused on that aspect of it. Trawling the internet for in-depth coverage from smartphone-oriented sites, one notices a suspiciously wide range of conclusions. You'll read that the display is excellent, just short of the best available. You'll also read that the display is mediocre with terrible viewing angles. You'll read that battery life is impressive for a device of this class, and you'll also read that the battery is inadequate. You'll read that the Flyme OS is polished and unique, yet also that it is derivative and inferior to stock Android. I can't explain these contradictions, but I do notice that everyone seems to agree on one aspect---the audio quality is very good.. While it's true that many InnerFidelity readers might never use a smartphone for serious music listening, it's also important to recognize the large (and growing) group of music lovers who will use nothing but their phone for that purpose. In that respect the Meizu MX 4-core surpasses the competition, which makes it easy to recommend. I especially love the SPDIF output, which means you can use the thing as a transport when paired with a dedicated DAC. Will it ever see a widespread North American release in light of Apple's recent billion-dollar smackdown of rival Samsung? That remains to be seen, and Meizu already has a history with Apple. If nothing else, think of this as a yardstick, a mark to which other smartphone makers should aspire to. It proves that when the hardware and software come together, the result can be very good indeed.. Meizu English homepage , and MX 4-core product page.

Submitted by Lawk on September 21, 2012 - 12:10pm. I wonder if the dual core version of this phone uses the same (bad according to various sources) Yamaha DAC from the Samsung Galaxy S2, if you look at the gsmarena review:. You can se that THD and IMD are considerably worse, than on the 4 core version. Just a thought because the 4 core Version, uses the Samsung Exynos, and the SGS3 has good sound, and the SGS2 with 2 core Exynos has bad sound.. will ask meizu about it, see if they respond.. Log in or register to post comments. Submitted by John Grandberg on September 22, 2012 - 9:03am. It seems to use the same Wolfson chip as the 4-core: LINK. It must be some type of optimization taking place to make the 4-core perform so well. Maybe similar to the camera - it somehow got a lot better from the MX to the MX 4-core, even though it seems to be the same hardware (or at least very similar).. I can't figure out the Samsung Galaxy S III - the USA version has more RAM than the International models, but only a dual core instead of quad core CPU, and a different (supposedly inferior) audio core as well? Weird.. Log in or register to post comments. Submitted by Can Crazy on September 24, 2012 - 1:14pm. Too bad that we still have to settle for buying a smartphone for a pretty big sum of money to get a minimumly decent sound on the go. If the objective was listening to music things could easily get soo much better. A pity Apple hasn't understood this and made a better effort with their iPods yet, as it's not an uninteresting market niche at all.. Log in or register to post comments. Submitted by Bennyboy on September 25, 2012 - 2:45am. My international Samsung Galaxy S3 has a 24 bit Wolfson DAC chip and outputs direct digital audio too. Not that I bother with that, because it sounds so fantastic anyway, and I think portable audio gear. with amps and external DAC add-ons is a bit extreme and ridiculous really.. Just my S3 and some cracking iems will do me.. Oh, and Poweramp is ok but Neutron is a damn sight better for audiophille sound - seriously, the flat setting is amazing, and with 64 bit processing and advanced resampling, not to mention parametric EQ, its a killer. UI is not as pretty as others, granted, but its perfectly fine.. Log in or register to post comments. Submitted by John Grandberg on September 25, 2012 - 7:01am. The international S3 version does look nice. Why Samsung messed with the specs for the USA model, I'll never understand.. Using the OTG cable will get you USB Host capabilities to connect to an external DAC. You might not want to use that while on the go, but it could be great if you also use a bigger home system. The Meizu MX 4-core should also be able to do USB connectivity in the same way, though I don't have the cable to test that myself. I still think the option Meizu has for coax SPDIF out is superior though - not all USB DACs will "talk" to the S3.. I like Neutron too but honestly it doesn't sound any better to me than Poweramp. And the interface seems lacking at the moment.... but the app does have potential.. Log in or register to post comments. The US model of the s3 does't. Submitted by E3SEL on September 27, 2012 - 2:27pm. The US model of the s3 doesn't have the same specs as the international s3 because the quad core exynos did not support 4g LTE. They instead used a dual core krait processor, which is basically as good because it is based on newer architecture, and it supports 4g LTE.. Log in or register to post comments. Still needs work as a cellphone. Submitted by grokit on September 30, 2012 - 2:55pm. Only problems, it doesn't work properly. It has a lot of connectivity issues. Poor reception bluetooth issues as well. Landscape mode too slow to pick up. Stock music player way too intrusive. Always comes in when there is no connection if you are listening to pandora or google music player. for tech support you have to send it back to main land China or Hong Kong.". Log in or register to post comments. Submitted by John Grandberg on October 1, 2012 - 8:55am. I didn't cover this in the main review because I didn't find it very relevant, but I did use the 4-core as a phone. My main wireless carrier uses CDMA so I just purchased a cheap AT&T pre-paid microSIM card and had my Google Voice number forward to the 4-core. It did just fine for me - bluetooth paired reliably, and reception was as good as I remember AT&T being. WiFi actually gets great reception, even working in dead spots around the house where my iPad2 doesn't.. The switch to landscape mode (and back again) seems to be deliberately delayed, to avoid accidental/unwanted switching. I don't think it is really lag because the delay is always the same even under heavy CPU load. I personally like the way they do it but I can see why someone would complain.. About the stock player - I don't use Pandora or Google Music much, so those could have a legit issue. For MOG and Spotify and Rdio the stock player doesn't launch.. So in summary, my experience has been different than that of the single Amazon reviewer, and I'd be happy to use this as a dedicated phone.. Log in or register to post comments. Submitted by BBEG on October 26, 2012 - 12:55pm. This article has been stuck in my head for the better part of a month now and brings to mind two main questions I'm hoping the author could answer.. First, sampling rate: "Meizu plays 44.1kHz tracks at their native rate so no extraneous processing takes place." Do you know if this is a hardware property or something native to the Flyme OS itself? I ask because there is a good chance I would be flashing Jelly Bean onto my next phone to stay current on Android, but I'm wary about doing this on the Meizu because I'm not sure how the audio is actually being handled.. Second, SPDIF output: "The Meizu MX is the first and only device I've seen that also does SPDIF audio. There's an option in the settings menu to enable this output, and it requires an adapter to interface with a coaxial SPDIF cable." If you guys still have the adapter, is it possible for you to test to see if it work on, say, an S3? I ask because both the Meizu and S3 are OTG-ready and support MHL. It would be interesting if you could use a small SPDIF adapter to connect more common flagship smartphones (like the S3) to more stubborn external DAC's (E17, who uses a slightly less than standard USB).. Log in or register to post comments. Submitted by John Grandberg on October 26, 2012 - 6:31pm. The sample rate question (#1) is probably a function of the software. But I don't know if it is built-in to Flyme, or if it is some other low level functionality. You could email Meizu to ask - they were very helpful and knowledgable when I had questions.. As for the SPDIF adapter - I somehow doubt it would work with an S3, simply because it isn't supported by the software on that model. With the Meizu, it didn't initially work either (which confused me at first). I had to go into settings and find "SPDIF output" and switch it to "on". The S3 would have no way to do that.. If I can get my hands on an S3 anytime soon, I'll give it a try just to see what happens. I also intend to try the S3 cable for USB out, to see if the Meizu can handle digital out through that method as well.. Log in or register to post comments. Submitted by BBEG on November 10, 2012 - 9:05am. Flyme has now been ported to the Galaxy S2, which is also a USB OTG device with MHL support.. If anyone has an S2 and feels like playing, they could see if the SPDIF audio output exists in the port. It would be very interesting to see if the SPDIF audio is a software capability vs a hardware capability (although I'd bet it still requires a MHL-capable USB port)..

Only problem is that my Bluetooth can only receive calls, it will not voice dial to make calls.. I tried with three different Bluetoth earpieces, none prompt me to speak when I press the button on the earpiece like they should.. I have been told that both Gingerbread and ICS support bluetooth voicedialing.. Is this an update/system issue, a defective phone, or is this phone not capable of what my old Motorola Razor (about 5 years old now) could do?. Any advice is appreciated as Bluetooth connectivity for voicedialing thru my earpiece is a necessity and I'd hate to have to return the phone.. Log in or register to post comments.

I was just wondering, after randomly bumping to this article and even reading the wikipedia one, it seems that even after many years of hardware development, the Nokia N91 could be the holy grail of portable players(sans dedicated amp), yeah, it seems it's "smooth" sounding, but still packing an "audiophile" punch. I would be interested if someone could share some information, or even conduct some testing if possible... John, Tyll, any of you two have some say?. Log in or register to post comments.

No, I can't seem to find any official release of the adapter for digital output. Seems a shame since they clearly had intentions to release it.

Exynos is a series of ARM -based System-on-Chips (SoCs) developed and manufactured by Samsung Electronics and is a continuation of Samsung's earlier S3C, S5L and S5P line of SoCs .. 2 List of ARMv7 Exynos SoCs. 3 List of ARMv8 Exynos SoCs. See also: List of Samsung system on chips. In 2010, Samsung launched the S5PC110 (now Exynos 3 Single) in its Samsung Galaxy S mobile phone, which featured a licensed ARM Cortex-A8 CPU. In early 2011, Samsung first launched the Exynos 4210 SoC in its Samsung Galaxy S II mobile smartphone. The driver code for the Exynos 4210 was made available in the Linux kernel [2] and support was added in version 3.2 in November 2011. On 29 September 2011, Samsung introduced Exynos 4212 [5] as a successor to the 4210; it features a higher clock frequency and "50 percent higher 3D graphics performance over the previous processor generation". [6] Built with a 32. nm high-κ metal gate (HKMG) low-power process; it promises a "30 percent lower power-level over the previous process generation.". On 30 November 2011, Samsung released information about their upcoming SoC with a dual-core ARM Cortex-A15 CPU, which was initially named "Exynos 5250" and was later renamed to Exynos 5 Dual. This SoC has a memory interface providing 12.8. GB/s of memory bandwidth, support for USB 3.0 and SATA 3 , can decode full 1080p video at 60 fps along with simultaneously displaying WQXGA -resolution (2560. 1600) on a mobile display as well as 1080p over HDMI. [7] Samsung Exynos 5 Dual has been used in a 2015 prototype supercomputer, [8] while the end-product will use a chip meant for servers from another vendor.. On 26 April 2012, Samsung released the Exynos 4 Quad, which powers the Samsung Galaxy S III and Samsung Galaxy Note II. [9] The Exynos 4 Quad SoC uses 20% less power than the SoC in Samsung Galaxy S II. Samsung also changed the name of several SoCs, Exynos 3110 to Exynos 3 Single, Exynos 4210 and 4212 to Exynos 4 Dual 45. nm, [10] and Exynos 4 Dual 32. nm [11] and Exynos 5250 to Exynos 5 Dual..

In this case, the ARM chip was a Samsung Exynos 5 Dual, a dual-core Cortex-A15 mobile SoC, paired with a Mali-T604 GPU.

Meizu MX 4 Core Andorid ICS phone launches an June 30th. Updated: Tuesday, March 26, 2013, 18:41 [IST]. There were rumours concerning the arrival of an Android powered Meizu mobile with Flyme OS 1.0 skin. Meizu has finally come up with a formal announcement of its new smartphone labelled as Meizu MX 4 Core. The formally announced specs are a little more interesting than what we heard in the rumours. It is more powerful than its predecessor model and is powered by Samsung"s quad core Exynos processor.. The new Samsung processor included in this handset is said to offer about 60% more faster performance and efficiency while considering the Meizu MX handset. The 4 inch display screen of this handset is improvised by 960 x 640 pixels resolution which is pretty decent considering similar handsets. This touchscreen display offers convenience to users, as well.. Other notable spec of this Meizu MX 4 Core handset is the 8 megapixel camera at the back side for shooting favourite snaps. Users can choose between built in storage options of 32GB or else 64GB.. The faster and smarter performance of the Meizu handset is assured with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich operating system. Along with numerous inbuilt features that come with the ICS OS, users have ultimate mobile experience as they can look forward to advanced apps, as well.. Meizu"s Flyme OS 1.0 can be seen on top of the ICS which is said to be a custom user interface. In addition to the interesting ICS features, this OS includes special super cool features like phone-finding service along with cloud storage options. The MX and M9 owners are eagerly waiting for the update of Flyme OS 1.0 to their handset which is promised to be around the middle of July.. The appearance is similar to its earlier dual core model. The phone comes in a back crystal shell which is coloured including milky lime, lilac purple, ivory white and misty pink. Meizu MX 4 Core is said to reach the smartphone market by the 30th of this month. The rumoured prices were around Rs.25,000/- for 32GB and around Rs.30,000/- for 64GB. The exact price details of this Meizu phone is yet to be confirmed..
