The LG K3 2017 is equipped with a 4.5-inch (854 x 480 pixels) display, 1.1 GHz quad-core processor, 1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of storage and a 5-megapixel camera.. OS: Android (6.0), LG UX UI. Dimensions: 5.27 x 2.75 x 0.37 inches (133.9 x 69.75 x 9.44 mm). Weight: 4.66 oz (132 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 480 x 854 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Face detection, Voice activation, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Features: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR). Quad-core, 1100 MHz, ARM Cortex-A7, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 5.50 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 20.8 days (500 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. LTE (FDD): Bands 2, 4, 5, 13. CDMA - Code Division Multiple Access. A technique of multiplexing, also called spread spectrum, in which analog signals are converted into digital form for transmission. For each communication channel, the signals are encoded in a sequence known to the transmitter and the receiver for that channel. The foremost application is digital cellular phone technology from QUALCOMM that operates in the 800MHz band and 1.9GHz PCS band. CDMA phones are noted for their excellent call quality and long battery life.. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 22 Dec 2016. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

LG K3 (2017) - user opinions and reviews. After tweaking in developer options and stopping animations,the K3 is fast After having it for a week.I wrote something about tabs,that was "List view,Tab view" in the Upper Right Corner.Performs like the LG G2 after tweaking like I did before I stepped away from SmartPhones for 3 years.I used an App called "Root Booster" And it made it fast then I started to tweak the Android in Developer's Options.Have no problems at All.It's mainly used as a NetFlix-app in the bedroom.ChromeCast finds the Phone easily.Still can surf the web and having the netflix movie still going.Wi-Fi is 33 feet away and still picks up Great.Great Phone!. I own this phone from textcom and I had an LG G2 before and it was a great phone until I lost Wifi.This phone comes with 6.01 Marshmallow and it's not too bad at all.I prefer the 5.1.1 since you can scroll all the way down the page in settings rather than tabs.Tabs are annoying.5.1.1 is faster than 6.01.This phone need a SD micro card because it seems to take 4.67 GB when my Apps are 2GB and have 1GB left.This LG K3 8GB is my 2nd smartphone and see how it needs now at least 16GB or invest in a SD Micro Card which is cheap.Getting Wifi on this phone was easy and it runs my chromecast and netflix.Battery life is a little faster draining than the 5.1.1.Screen is vibrant.Runs cool most of the time.Got it under $50 and worth it.. Sunny, 14 Apr 2017 I thought LG had abandoned these sort of low-end phones. Seriously I wouldn't buy a phone with... more You dont have to buy it if you dont like. There are millions of people who wants to use a small handy and long lasting battery phone. There is nothing wrong in making phones like this. This photo is NOT the version 2017 !!!. The volume buttons are downer, and there is no led flash light beside the camera(on it's back) on the version 2017. I have problem for phone in lg k3 and lg ls 450. You can help me please? reply me pleaser????. Jerry101923, 06 Jan 2017 Absolutely unacceptable to just have 8GB of ROM. I think every smartphones starting from 2017 ... more enough with calling the internal storage memory ROM. That is the storage space instead, like a ssd in a PC or Mac. I thought LG had abandoned these sort of low-end phones. Seriously I wouldn't buy a phone with only 1gb ram and 2100 mah battery. It must be slow as hell. Nice but why it's not android 7 ?. LG still compromise specs on small phones :/. Absolutely unacceptable to just have 8GB of ROM. I think every smartphones starting from 2017 must have at least 16GB of ROM, even if it's a low-end one.. The same as s7 samsung camera sony 23 others 12,13 real joke. Yea its a joke but p. Specs are terrible for Q1/Q2 2017 Smarthphone, unless you plan to use it for calls only. Install few apps, browse with many tabs and probably will start to hang.
