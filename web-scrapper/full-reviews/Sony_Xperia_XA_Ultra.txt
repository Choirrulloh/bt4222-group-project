Also it's internal memory after some media uses not reliable. I love Sony devices but for this... This phone easily overheats and thermal throttles itself. Don't bother buying this piece of crap.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. posted by Chris P.. Android - Android + Sony - Sony +. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction Beginning in early 2016, Sony transitioned away from the exclusively high-end, flagship Z line, to the more inclusive X series, with products spanning the echelons beyond mid-range. For months to come, we won't know if this re-branding exercise will positively affect the company's bottom line. But we're now in a pretty good position to guess. Say hello to the Sony Xperia XA Ultra - the last of the X line to stumble upon our doorstep. It's a gigantic 6-incher, encased within a metal frame, with a pronounced, high-resolution selfie camera with flash, and featuring some pretty decent hardware underneath. With a $369.99 sticker price, however, our prodding and nudging best reveal some unexpected strengths, lest it follows its brethren into the strictly average category. Design Signature Sony, larger canvass So the XA Ultra is huge. And heavy, too, tipping the scales at 6.7 oz (190 g). Combined, these factors equal a monstrous device that isn't for the faint-hearted and is firmly entrenched in phablet land. Beyond its dimensions, the XA Ultra is yet another familiar Sony face, built on the principles of its rectangular design philosophy. The phone is protected by a solid, metal frame, with the display up front almost floating out of it thanks to those extra slim side bezels. The rest of the phone is made out of polycarbonate. On the right, Sony has cleverly positioned the volume rocker and power key, both of which are easily accessible even when you're holding this monster phone with just one paw. Better yet, tactile feedback and travel times are excellent, and we're including the physical shutter key here, as well. Overall? Absolutely no surprises here except, perhaps, the Cyclops eye up front that is the selfie camera, along with the Lime Gold coloring of our review unit. This is strictly personal opinion, but it comes across as tacky, so make sure to check out the white and black options as well. Display An extremely bright display with disappointing color accuracy This being a massive phone, the 6-inch, 1080 x 1920 pixel resolution LCD display is obviously the highlight of the show. But right off the bat, we were disappointed with its quality. And our scientific measurements prove it. Not only is the Ultra's display not good, it's actually downright disappointing. We start off our unpleasant journey through its properties with an extremely cold color temperature of 9400K, significantly twisting color reproduction towards blue—and most visibly, whites and grays. That's not a surprise, given how much blue dominates between the primary red, green, and blue, with the former two being seriously underrepresented—and red ridiculously so. Average gamma, at 2.61, is also consistently off target across the brightness spectrum, and so is overall color accuracy, which is simply average. Speaking of brightness, at least that the XA Ultra's display has going for it: over 600 nits at the top end, which is just excellent, and 5 nits at its lowest, which is also great. In the end, what should be the XA Ultra's defining feature ends up disappointing. Sure, it's very much usable outdoors, but color calibration is seriously problematic.. 6.46 x 3.11 x 0.33 inches. 164 x 79 x 8.4 mm. 6.27 x 3.06 x 0.29 inches. 159.3 x 77.8 x 7.3 mm. 6.37 x 3.19 x 0.29 inches. 161.7 x 80.9 x 7.4 mm. 6.81 x 3.48 x 0.3 inches. 173.1 x 88.3 x 7.5 mm.

Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software..

I got this phone just a week it came to my country. this was my first impression after I filled up all the warranty notes at Sony Store, the next few hours I need to connect to my mobile / pocket wifi. and believe me, i have a pretty hard time connecting to it. though after few weeks and months they got more system updates. I have my other phones with me but wifi connectivity is good and have no problem but his phone sucks at it. This phone and my pocket wifi is place side by side but the wifi bar is weak and interment. 1) it says 16GB internal but it is only 10Gb usable in total. so you need to very very very careful on saving storage. Though it has option to transfer photos / videos to SD, it is just up to that. While not all android app supports moving to SD, then you have that very big storage problem. 2) takes 3 minutes to BOOT. with the useless Xperia logo animation. Good thing they removed the PIN before you boot. (Posts: 2; Member since: 04 Jan 2017). posted on 04 Jan 2017, 19:34. Want to comment? Please login or register ..

CNET también está disponible en español.. Sony's Xperia XA Ultra is all screen, and even more camera. Selfie-obsessed shutterbugs after a stylish statement phone will be drawn to this 6-inch device like moths to a flame.. by May 16, 2016 6:00 PM PDT. Sony supersizes its selfie efforts with the Xperia XA Ultra. Sony's Xperia XA Ultra phone makes a bid for your selfies. Sony has yet to put its freshly introduced Xperia X smartphone range on sale and it's already updating the lineup with a new 6-inch model.. It might be late to the party, but it's still making a statement.. Unlike the Xperia X , the smaller XA and the X Performance , which are all about top specs and processing might, the real emphasis of this larger phone targeted at younger, edgier phone owners is its photography prowess. And, of course, its attention-grabbing screen.. Just like the Xperia XA, there's nothing new to see design-wise here from Sony, but the Ultra does support that superthin bezel that so impressed us when we first saw it on its smaller sibling. The benefit of the edge-to-edge display really does come into its own with a larger phone. It gives the impression that the XA Ultra's 6-inch screen is in fact closer to 5.5 inches in size. With no excess metal down the sides, this phone is also easier to keep a hold of.. Sony supersizes its selfie efforts with the Xperia XA Ultra. The front-facing 16-megapixel camera has a super-wide angle that has been designed to produce bright selfies in all conditions with no sign of blurring. Unusually for Sony, this camera comes with optical image stabilisation. According to Jun Makino, Sony's senior manager of product experience marketing, this is because "your hands tend to shake when you are taking selfies with a big phone." We'll leave final verdict on the quality of the low-light shots for our full review.. A couple of clever tricks like a hand-activated shutter and a timer in the top corner -- to encourage people to look at the lens rather than themselves -- should enhance selfies further. Additionally, the night portrait mode combines an image taken with the flash off and an image with the flash on to present a single, well-balanced photo in which the foreground and background are both adequately lit.. Plenty of attention has also been paid to the main camera, which packs an impressive 21.5 megapixels. Hybrid autofocus object tracking is built in, which means it should be stay on the ball -- should you be attempting to photograph a moving one -- but it doesn't have the same predictive capabilities as the Xperia X .. Inside is the same Mediatek processor as the Xperia XA, 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal expandable storage. As much as it's necessary to take note of what the phone offers, it may also be worth casting your eye over what it is missing -- namely no waterproofing and no USB-C.. The XA Ultra will be available in graphite black, white and lime gold. There is no word yet on availability and pricing, but Sony did say that it had a global release planned for the phone..

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. If you’re looking for a phone that 1) is capable, yet cheap, 2) has a phenomenal front-facing camera, and 3) has Android Nougat coming soon, the Sony Xperia XA Ultra was basically made for you.. Sony Xperia XA Ultra price and release date Design Looks like other Xperia phones, but that’s not a bad thing Ditches waterproofing and fingerprint sensor to cut costs The button layout is intuitive, unlike some other Sony phones. When comparing flagships to cheaper mid-range smartphones, you might think to know exactly where compromises have likely been made. But, the Sony Xperia XA Ultra will test you harder than most.. It’s a mid-range phone through and through, but it avoids the typical pitfalls made when distilling a flagship formula. You’ll find its 6-inch screen cradled in a solidly constructed mixture of glass and metal. The XA Ultra gives off nearly as much visual flair as its more expensive family members, like the Sony Xperia X Performance and Sony Xperia XZ .. Surprisingly, it also squeezes in one new feature that we haven’t seen elsewhere in Sony’s X-series of smartphones: the wide-eyed 16MP front-facing camera. Thankfully, it’s not just a number-pushing gimmick. It’s definitely worth checking out if you’re an avid user of Snapchat or any other video chat app.. Of course, it’s not without its share of minor faults. As with the Sony Xperia XA , we were disappointed that you won’t find beloved Xperia features here, like a waterproof design or fingerprint sensor.. But, at $300 (£299), the Sony Xperia XA Ultra is a very strong effort, one that pushes the boundaries of what we should expect out of mid-range competitors, and Sony itself, moving forward.. Sony’s selfie-focused XA Ultra is available now in the US and UK. We’ve requested info regarding global availability and pricing, and will update this review when we hear back.. In the US, this device retails online for $300 – just $100 above the smaller Sony Xperia XA. Though, since we’re in the midst of holiday deals, we’ve seen it going as low as $230. Keep your eye out for more discounts as time goes on.. Like the rest of Sony’s recent lineup, you won’t find this phone at your local carrier. It’s available unlocked only, and as such, you can activate it on the GSM-compatible carrier of your choosing. In the US, that means it’s limited to networks like AT&T and T-Mobile, and unfortunately, means it won’t work for those on CDMA carriers, like Verizon or Sprint.. The design of the Sony Xperia XA Ultra follows closely in line with that of other X-series phones, which is to say that there’s nothing new here that you haven’t already seen used in the Sony Xperia XA. It’s just a bigger version, with a blown-out front-facing camera. But, at that, it’s still worthy of discussion.. Sony’s mid-range smartphone weighs a hefty 201 grams and measures in at 162.5 x 78.7 x 7.6mm. The XA Ultra isn’t the thinnest or the lightest of the budget smartphones out there. But, for some, the design will strike all of the right chords. The XA Ultra is as easy on the eye as it is the hand, and its smooth, rounded corners of the device complement the nearly bezel-free screen. The combination of its glossy, speckled front and matte-textured back come together nicely on our lime green review unit.. The main attraction of the front of the XA Ultra is obviously its 6-inch, 1080p IPS LCD display. You’ll find but the slightest bit of bezel to each of its sides – and effect that gives it an edgy, futuristic look. Look up a little and you’re greeted with the large front-facing camera lens, along with the ambient light sensor, flash, and speaker near the top of the phone. Its bottom bezel is thinner by comparison, too thin for capacitive buttons. Instead, it delegates those to the spacious touchscreen.. The XA Ultra plays host to the usual set of features around its sides. As is tradition with Sony-branded phones of late, the SIM and microSD tray is on the left, and the buttons are on the right side.. Unlike the other X-series phones, credit goes to Sony for making the volume rocker easy to reach on this phone. It’s right next to the circular power button, as it should have been on its other phones. It was awkwardly placed near the bottom corner on the Sony Xperia X Compact and Sony Xperia X Performance, making it all-too-easy to drop these expensive phones.. Near the bottom edge is the shutter button, which can be held during sleep state to boot straight into the camera app. Bummer about the lack of a fingerprint sensor, though.. Its back is barren, aside from the rear-facing camera sensor, flash, and some light branding. Its matte-textured metal back means that your fingerprints won’t cling, making the sterling look of this phone ring true even after some time.. Next Page What's it like to use?.

The Xperia XA Ultra is the same device that we previously saw presented (unofficially) as the Xperia C6 Ultra. As its name suggests, the XA Ultra is a larger version of the Xperia XA, having a relatively similar design - including an edge-to-edge display. Of course, since this is a bigger device, the display is also bigger than on the regular XA: it's a 6-inch panel with 1080 x 1920 pixels. One of the highlight features of the Sony Xperia XA Ultra is its 16 MP front-facing camera with LED flash and OIS (optical image stabilization), which should let you take high quality selfies. The handset also packs a 21.5 MP rear camera, but it seems that this one doesn't have OIS.. Sony Xperia XA Ultra Review Sony Xperia XA Ultra manual Sony Xperia XA Ultra benchmarks. Dimensions: 6.46 x 3.11 x 0.33 inches (164 x 79 x 8.4 mm). Weight: 7.13 oz (202 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 6.0 inches. Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels.

Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations..

These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

VINE VOICE HALL OF FAME TOP 10 REVIEWER. 4.0 out of 5 stars Not Sony’s best but still impressive. Color: White | Vine Customer Review of Free Product ( What's this? ). This is a lengthy review, a phone as sophisticated and noteworthy as this one deserves full attention to details. Because it is a new product of course complete testing will take additional time, this review will be updated as needed. I have always liked Sony products, especially their TV's and cameras. I don't think there's a room in my house without at least one Sony product. However I've only been able to admire their smartphones from afar, they generally are priced way out of my range. The XA1 series however, brings a lot of Sony niceness down to a more budget-friendly realm. This series has two phones, a 5" model and this, the newer Ultra 6" model. HOW BIG IS IT? Let's let the cat out of the bag right now ... this phone is huge, almost bordering on tablet territory. In fact its screen size is spec’d at exactly the same 6” size as a Kindle but in a device that’s a fraction of the size. This is NOT one of Sony's ultra-premium models and other than the better-than-average build quality (typically Sony) the overall performance is good, but not fantastic. Other phones offer higher resolution displays, not that this one looks bad; it's just not the best out there. Sound quality (something I would hope Sony would excel at) is better than some but not as good as the best, and surprisingly there are no stereo speakers. THE CAMERA And the camera? The one thing you absolutely expect Sony to be best-of-class at? Let me be clear that I am a pro photographer with a critical eye and I have a great deal of respect for Sony cameras. Despite mind-blowing specs on paper, the XA1's camera quality failed to make me go WOW. They brag about how quickly you can go from off to picture-taking mode (1.1 seconds) but once you actually press the button the camera is comparatively slow to complete the task, and sometimes misses the ideal setting completely. The results are not as good as I expected, and in low light they sometimes disappointed me. The selfie cam on the other hand is impressive ... wider angle than most to cram more friends in the frame, a real front flash that actually works and a cool shutter release that's activated by waving your hand (that only gets tricked once in a while). The full-face screen that goes almost to the very edge is sure to impress the Joneses, but the weird little gap with a tiny black border gives away the fact that this isn't Sony's best effort. The phone is chock-full of features and gimmicks, too many to list here. It ships with Android 7.0 Nougat and Sony' better than average overlay. Response (as you would expect) is lightning quick. Despite being huge in your hand it's not slippery and the beveled edges feel better than you would expect. The control buttons feel, um, very iPhone-like. Get ready, though, to buy some new cables because this phone ditches the more common micro USB in favor of the incompatible USB-C. At least it still has a headphone jack! EXPLAINING THE SAMPLE PHOTOS A side-note about the size comparison and camera quality photos with this review. Why compare it to an iPhone? I assure you I understand that this phone and the iPhone are very different devices and my comparison is in no way intended to suggest one is better than the other. The IPhone 6s was used because it is the only other smartphone in our household and it was handy. The 6s is almost identical in size to the iPhone 7 and together the two of them represent a large percentage of phones people own, so I thought a size comparison might be useful to some people. As far as the photo sample comparison, as a professional photographer who has written books and taught classes on the subject I have said countless times that more megapixels does not mean better picture quality, there are so many other factors involved in a camera’s ability to take high-quality pictures. The samples I used weren't staged in any special way, just a spontaneous random snapshot taken at the same time from the same spot of a wall-hanging in our living room under low lighting conditions (the light of a 40 watt bulb). The settings on the two phones were whatever the camera defaulted to (and granted with user adjustment settings both photos could be enhanced). No flash was used because I wanted to see how they would do under a challenging low light condition. Finally, be aware that both photos were cropped identically to exactly 10% of the full frame, so you are seeing an extreme example of “digital zoom”. The samples you see are the result, you can draw your own conclusions. That being said, my random snapshot comparison was not counted by me in rating this phone, I plan to post some additional sample photos later. But I want to make it clear that the Sony's camera is extremely good and I've already taken some very nice photos with it. If anything the comparison only points out that (like most cameras with tiny sensors) this one is not perfect, especially under low light in which it seems to crank up the gain way too much. NON-POSITIVE OBSERVATIONS I was surprised and disappointed at the battery life, it’s not only bad it’s really bad. I could almost watch the battery-level meter ticking downward toward zero. I’ll offset that by saying that Sony packs numerous of their apps into the phone and with any new phone it takes a little time to customize how the device is set up. But even after deleting some apps and changing the settings battery life is still pretty bad. On one hand that is to be expected from a phone with a huge hi-res screen, I’ll see how it is after a few weeks of use. Another little quirk that has been an annoyance is that dedicated camera shutter release button. In concept I love the idea but it seems super sensitive to the point that I can hardly hold the phone in my hand without accidentally taking a picture. But, I don’t want to disable the feature either. It seems maybe Sony should have used a stronger spring in that button that would require a more firm push to activate. INITIAL SUMMARY Is this the best phone out there? No. Does it represent Sony's best effort? No. All things considered (including price) is it worth considering? A qualified yes on that one ... after using it I would rate it as one of a handful of phablets worth considering if you're into a lot of video playback and don't want to break the bank (although the lack of stereo speakers on a multimedia-aimed phone is a disappointment). As a camera phone when you want to leave the real camera home it should please most people most of the time (but there are definitely better camera phones out there). And used as strictly a cell phone for talking and texting it’s probably a lot of overkill but it's hard to imagine anyone being disappointed. But … remember this is not supposed to be Sony’s top of the line phone. When you consider what this phone sells for and how much value you get for the price, it is still very much one that should be on your short list of super-size smartphones to consider. As this phone is used more I will try to update this review as needed and of course answer any specific questions if I can.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Gigantic and Amazing Phone. I'll start off by saying this is the biggest phone I've ever owned, so it is taking a bit of adjustment for me to hold with one hand (I have pretty big hands,) to hold sideways and use the keyboard (even though I'm doing that right now for this review and the predictions and auto correct are pretty spot on,) and it feels noticeably bulkier in my pocket. All those things aside considering I knew I was buying a large phone... It feels like there's no delay when I open games on my phone. Games like Pokémon Go, Brave Soul, Crusaders of Light, etc. all open on this phone quickly and look absolutely stunning. Not to mention the giant screen makes things easier to see. I threw in an old 64gb micro SD card along with my nano SIM and was immediately using this phone without any hiccups. All four buttons are on the right side of the phone - volume up/down, power (which is lock and unlock button, as per usual,) and the camera button. Though spaced apart perfectly enough where they're not in the way of each other, I kinda wish the power button was on top of the phone. That's just a preference of habit, though! The speaker is on the bottom of the phone alongside the charger port. Takes the C charger, which is gonna be the future universal charger in my opinion (kinda like going from cassette tape to CD,) due to the faster data and electrical transfer speeds. How's the speaker? I'd truthfully say mediocre. It's also in a spot that can easily and accidentally be covered by your index finger when holding the phone horizontal. That or maybe I just hold my phone weird. I consider the camera pretty stunning myself, but I'm also moving up from a phone that had half the MP on both cameras compared to this one. I don't see a single grain in new photos off this phone. Finally, the part I love most. This phone doesn't strong arm you into using the pre installed "bloatware" like other phones typically do. You don't wanna use the default music and photo apps? Don't give them permission. This phone asks you permission for pretty much every app that comes pre installed. When you say no, it's not a clingy girlfriend. It leaves you alone permanently until you attempt to use the app again. It may seem overwhelming when first setting up the phone (essentially, imagine a "Do you wish to allow...?" every 30 seconds for maybe 5-10 minutes,) but after that it's smooth sailing. And that minor and short-lived annoyance is a tiny price to pay in my opinion for Sony being nice enough to ask for my consent before bloatware assaulting my phone. Tl;Dr My rating speaks for itself. For the tech in this phone, the size, the midrange price... I'd highly recommend if you have a thing for large phones, but don't want one of the phones that are tablet sized.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Works much better than the HTC, Samsun, and Motorola phones I've used. Very slim and I LOVE how Sony keeps updating and making things easier. 5.0 out of 5 stars Works much better than the HTC. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Like the saying goes...you get what you pay for. I wanted an inexpensive phone since I'm tired of wasting money on so called high-end expensive phones. 3.0 out of 5 stars Like the saying goes. I was hoping it work with super charger but you can only use a super charger 3.0 that also support MTK Pump Express plus(PE2. 4.0 out of 5 stars I was hoping it work with super charger but you can only use a super charger .... What a beautiful phone,took it to metro pcs to have it connected and they asked me where I got it said it was a very sexy phone. 5.0 out of 5 stars What a beautiful phone, took it to metro pcs to have .... I gave this a 3 star because this product battery life is embarrassing. if you buy this phone ensure never to leave your charger at home. I also find that even with a Qualcomm 3. 3.0 out of 5 stars Battery life is bad but has a fast processor and good screen resolution.. Best phone I've had Sammie s7, s5, note 5 those phones are overrated. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. The Bluetooth never worked for this phone.. 3.0 out of 5 stars Bluetooth problem. This is a great phone at a decent price, the only drawback is the camera, the picture quality is not the best. The phone is a little big for some but it's still a great value.. 5.0 out of 5 stars This is a great phone at a decent price. This shopping feature will continue to load items.

Six inches of Sony, and MediaTek —. along with some serious camera action — could be the start of another big thing for the Japanese manufacturer's reboot of the Xperia line.. After unveiling the next chapter of its mobile story at Mobile World Congress in the form of the Xperia X series, Sony has today added another member to its Xperia family. The Xperia XA Ultra takes the basis of the XA and upscales it to an enormous 6-inch form factor.. Building on earlier mid-range Sony "phablets" like the Xperia C5 Ultra, the XA Ultra brings a gigantic display to what should be an affordable handset. Design-wise, it closely mirrors its smaller sibling, meaning the footprint of the phone is surprisingly narrow. That in turn means it's not impossible to one-hand in a pinch.. On the outside, the XA Ultra features a similarly good-looking polycarbonate body, with Sony's trademark symmetrical design language front and back. Sure, it's yet another rectangular design, but it's also elegant and uncluttered — if not as impressive to behold as the metal and glass-based competition. We're fans of the 2.5D-effect glass use by Sony here, and paired with the rounded sides and corners, this gives the impression of something that's industrial, yet slightly organic. (And yet, that also helps with ergonomics.). The 6-inch display is eye-catching — as is the OIS-equipped selfie camera.. Around the front, there's one thing that'll catch your eye besides the 6-inch 1080p display, and that's the front-facing camera. Although it sits flush with the surface of the screen, there's a noticeable border around it, and it's larger than the average selfie camera. There's a good reason for that — the XA Ultra's front camera boasts a 16-megapixel sensor with OIS (optical image stabilization.) And to top it off, there's also a front-facing flash. Still, it's something that'll stand out each time you pick the phone up.. Around the back, there's a more traditional 21.5-megapixel shooter — a Sony Exmor RS sensor — without any hardware stabilization. Sony says its Bionz processing enhancements mean it's able to handle low-light scenes well even without OIS — another claim we'll have to put to the test.. As for the display itself, we found it reasonably bright and vivid in our brief time with the XA Ultra, though we'll need to spend more time with the phone to know how it performs in daylight. In any case, we didn't find the 6-inch screen size to be a problem when combined with that Full HD resolution.. In terms of performance, the pre-production Xperia XA Ultra we used handled Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Sony's UI with ease, though it was somewhat less speedy than the higher-specced Xperia X. Again, performance will likely tighten up some as the phone approaches launch.. And battery life remains unclear as well, with a 2,700mAh cell powering the XA Ultra — that's not a whole lot of juice behind a very large smartphone display. That number's enough to make is a little nervous, but numbers alone rarely tell the full story.. Overall, the Xperia XA Ultra is an intriguing handset catering to those wanting a big screen, top-notch selfie capabilities and a price tag that won't break the bank. It's an important addition that lets Sony flesh out its major new line of Xperia phones.. We should have more details on pricing and availability for the Xperia XA Ultra soon, so keep it locked to Android Central for the latest.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

Sony Xperia XA Ultra aimed at those who are looking for premium specifications and features in the mid range. Technology Tech Reviews Sony Xperia XA Ultra review: High on camera specs, battery. Sony Xperia XA Ultra is a large phablet with a 6-inch Full HD display. But despite being large this phone is handy and just as wide as the Apple iPhone 6s Plus. Sony Xperia Ultra comes with a 21MP rear camera is 21MP. I was really happy with the kind of images I managed in the garden with a grist of bees buzzing around. Sony Xperia XA Ultra’s rear camera gives you a full manual option as well as a bunch of Sony’s regular fun presets. Sony Xperia XA Ultra’s rear camera comes with hybrid autofocus, which lets you click really cool action shoots as well as subtle low-light images. Sony Xperia XA Ultra aimed at those who are looking for premium specifications and features in the mid range.. Updated: May 22, 2017 3:16 pm. Sridevi funeral LIVE UPDATES: Mortal remains to arrive in Mumbai today Sridevi dies at 54, leaves India in shock Railway Group D recruitment 2018 for 62,907 posts: Eligibility criteria changes, apply online. After a challenging year, Sony has decided that it will sell only premium smartphones in India. However, these days premium smartphones are not just the expensive flagships and could also be the mid-range flagships which are also premium for most buyers. Anyway, the Japanese tech giant has just launched the Sony Xperia XA Ultra aimed at those who are looking for premium specifications and features in the mid range.. The Sony Xperia XA Ultra is a large phablet with a 6-inch Full HD display. But despite being large this phone is handy and just as wide as the Apple iPhone 6s Plus. The phone is large but not intimidating. It also looks like any other Xperia and has a very familiar design language. It also has a feature which is becoming very rare, a dedicated camera button.. Specs: 6-inch Full HD (1080 x 1920 pixels, ~367ppi) | Mediatek MT6755 Helio P10 octa-core with 3GB RAM | 16GB storage expandable up to 200GB | 21MP rear + 16MP front camera | 2700mAh battery | Android 6.0 | Sony Xperia XA Ultra full specs. I liked the overall design and feel of the phone. It gives you the confidence you would expect from a Sony phone. Everything from the power button to the flap that holds the dual-SIM slots have been crafted to last and it shows. And despite being a heavy phone, it won’t bother users much.. The Full HD display is bright and vivid. Also, there is a swipe option to bring in one-handed operations for those who find it hard to use all the real estate. I, however, would urge such people not to buy such a big phone.. This phone is all about the camera. It has a 16MP selfie camera. This front clicker is really good and makes even my face look presentable when it is shot in pitch darkness with just the flash on. The front camera also gives you natural photographs, a rarity in these selfie obsessed days.. Yes, you heard that right too. And it comes with hybrid autofocus, which lets you click really cool action shoots as well as subtle low-light images. I was really happy with the kind of images I managed in the garden with a grist of bees buzzing around. It also gives you a full manual option as well as a bunch of Sony’s regular fun presets.. Being a large phone, the Xperia XA Ultra can house a really large battery. However, Sony has decided to innovate on the battery and is using Smart Battery Management to make a 2,700 mAh battery last well over 36 hours with regular use. In fact, if you look at battery management stats, you see really incredible numbers of hours left even with lower percentages of battery. For a while I used it as a secondary phone and I would take the phone out once in a while, with there being juice every time. Sony also claims its Qnovo Adaptive Charging technology will make this battery last longer with better charging management.. The phone has no performance issues, though it is stacked in the middle ranges when it comes to benchmark scores. There is no lag or stutter when you use this phone, but graphic performance can be better at this price range.. I usually think Sony phones are a bit overpriced, like most of big brands out there. However, the Xperia XA Ultra seems a value buy for those who consider the camera, screen and battery as their main priorities. There might be other phones that do better on sheer performance in this range, but they would have had to cut corners on the other three fronts. Sony might just be able to tap into a niche market here.. For all the latest Technology News , download Indian Express App. © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd.

Sony’s newest Xperia X member is a phablet with a 16-megapixel selfie camera. At Mobile World Congress 2016, Sony unveiled three new devices in a new Xperia X lineup. None of those phones are available. yet, but Sony’s added a fourth to the series — the Xperia XA Ultra.. Xperia XA Ultra is a larger version of the lower-tier Xperia XA. small bezels, and the same button placement as the rest of the Xperia X series — the power button is on the bottom-right edge, and the volume rocker is on the center-right edge. a curved glass display, which makes it stand out from the rest of the Xperia X series.. 6-inch screen classifies the XA Ultra as a phablet, but even though it’s the largest of the X lineup, the. resolution remains the same as the other higher-end models at 1080p.. The device is being touted for its selfie-camera capabilities more than anything else — it has a 16-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 21.5-megapixel rear one. The front camera is supported with Sony’s low-light sensor to improve. the exposure in dark environments, and it also utilizes. optical image stabilization for photos and videos to minimize hand shake.. camera has an 88-degree wide-angle lens with an aperture of f./2.6, and also features “Hand Shutter,” which allows you to take a shot just by raising your hand. The shutter timer will start a count down, giving you a moment to strike the right facial expression. You can also use the front-facing flash for additional. rear camera has an aperture of f./2.4, and it doesn’t seem to have the same OIS capabilities as the front-facing camera. It uses “Hybrid Autofocus,” and has a quick launch and capture feature — meaning you can go from standby to snapping a shot in “a fraction of a second.”. The front-facing camera certainly sounds better than what the current flagship model, the Xperia X Performance, offers — a 13-megapixel camera. The rear on the Performance, on the other hand, has 23-megapixels. Megapixels aren’t what makes a good camera. though, so we’ll have to test out these devices when they’re released to see how well they fare.. The phone is powered by a MediaTek MT6755. processor, and has 3GB of RAM. The company says users can expect two days of battery life on a single charge thanks to a 2,700mAh battery capacity. Take that with a grain of salt, as companies typically overestimate how long a device will last for average users.. Running on Android Marshmallow, the device will come with 16GB of internal storage, but you can throw in a MicroSD card with up to 200GB of capacity.. The XA Ultra works with Sony’s Quick Charger UCH12, which supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 and can reportedly supply. 5.5 hours of battery life within only 10 minutes of charging. However, Sony has opted for a standard micro-USB port for charging, rather than USB Type-C.. The Quick Charger UCH12 is only offered as a separate accessory to. of accessories — Sony will offer various covers for the XA Ultra to add style and protection, including the Style Cover Flip, which turns the screen on or off when you open and close the case.. For a quick recap, the Xperia X lineup includes: the Xperia X Performance, the flagship model; the Xperia X; and the Xperia XA, a budget device with low specs. There have been rumors of another device, the Xperia X Premium , which would make it. the fifth device in the X series after the XA Ultra.. The Xperia XA Ultra will be available in black, white, or lime gold beginning in July in “selected markets,” which includes the U.S. More details on the release date of the entire Xperia lineup, including pricing, will be announced.

Remember those days when rooting was a simple set of steps that anyone with basic computing knowledge could follow? Pepperidge Farm XDA Developers remembers, and especially XDA Senior Member. who has kindly put together a very easy-to-follow rooting guide for Sony’s phablet, the Xperia XA Ultra .. Every device manufacturer has its own set of quirks and hoops to jump through when it comes to liberating its. While Sony was, in many occasions, labelled as one of the most developer friendly OEMs in the market , its products are not without their complexities. In the particular case of Sony devices (most/all devices released after the Xperia Z back in 2012), they come with a little drawback when it comes to unlocking: while most devices can lose their warranties when you unlock them, Sony takes things a few steps further and effectively disables features (proprietary to Sony Mobile) by virtue of deletion of DRM keys. This was something that earlier developers on our site figured out and despite discussions with Sony Mobile employees, it is something that stayed behind as a means to protect the company’s IP. Unlocking your BootLoader will void your warranty, break your device DRM and lose X-Reality and image optimization on low light when taking pictures.. Naturally, rooting requires unlocking of the bootloader, which will have the side effect of wiping the aforementioned keys. However, on top of the guide presenting a simple method for rooting, it also includes specific steps to be taken in order to preserve the DRM keys, in case one wants to revert back to a stock software configuration (be it for warranty purposes or any other reason). The process is quite simple and it involves backing up said keys prior to the actual unlocking through a process called TA Backup via a tool created by. XDA Recognized Developer rayman .. Another bump in the road to rooting is the fact that depending on which variant of the device you purchased, it may or may not be rootable with this guide. The reason behind it is that not all Sony devices are created equal as they may come with an non-unlockable bootloader. So, word of advise, if you are in the market for one of these and will be requiring root, read through our fora and Google around before you spend your hard earned money.. Please do keep in mind that the guide this is linked to is only for Android Nougat. Should you still be sporting Marshmallow on your XA Ultra, you will need to follow. If you have read all the warnings, backed up anything important, and are ready to go, then head over to the thread to get started!. guide root root guide sony sony experia Xperia Xperia XA Ultra.

Xperia XA Ultra review: average camera, amazing battery. The Xperia XA Ultra comes to the domestic market in two weeks and its main feature is its 16 MP front camera supported by an LED flash.. The device's 6-inch screen also draws attention along with its. Check out the pros and cons of the Xperia XA Ultra in my full review.. Sony Xperia XA Ultra release date and price. Sony has a launch event scheduled for August 10 in São Paulo, at 10am, where it will make the official announcement of this smartphone.. Therefore, we do not have a suggested retail price of the device, or the date on which will be available for purchase.. However, the specifications of the XA. Ultra are higher than the Xperia X, which hit the market for $550 so. Sony Xperia XA Ultra design and build quality. The Xperia XA Ultra is pure screen. The position of the speaker could not be worse for those who use the smartphone for gaming and multimedia. The SIM and micro-SD slots are protected by a cover, but it does not mean that the device is water resistant.. Compared with the line Xperia Z and even the Xperia X and X Performance, the Xperia XA Ultra has a design feature that draws our attention when. the screen is activated: the lack of bezels.. In this sense, Sony is to be congratulated on the X series.. Another very interesting feature is a 16 MP sensor on the. upper front of the XA Ultra, which, despite its size, hasn't increased the upper and lower bezels compared to the previous models.. The Xperia XA Ultra is not a discrete device with its 6-inch screen and. holding the device in your hands is not as comfortable as having a model like the. Moto X Style, for example, with its back curve.. So if you have no interest in phablets, I. Now if this is your niche, be aware that Sony actually managed to optimize the front of the unit for the screen.. Ultra name, the new phablet Sony does not have premium features.. This is midrange phone with some extra features, but does not have the fingerprint reader like. Thus, the device comes with the same features as. The frame of the Xperia XA Ultra is made of aluminum, but the back is clear polycarbonate.. The model only weighs 202 g and is 8.4 mm thick.. On the left side of the frame, we have the. SIM card and Micro-SD memory card slots. However, this characteristic of the Xperia line smartphones. water resistance but in the case of Ultra XA it is purely aesthetic, since the device does not have. At the top, there is a mini jack. for headphones, and at the bottom we find a speaker.. Incidentally, there is no worse position for the speakers for playing. The Xperia XA Ultra will be available in four colors: white, black, gold and lime.. The Xperia XA Ultra gives us some rich colors. The white balance feature is not very convenient to use. The Xperia XA Ultra screen 6 inches with. The screen has a Full HD resolution with. IPS LCD technology, which offers a good experience in bright sunlight when the screen brightness is at 100% capacity.. screen is above average, the viewing angles are really good.. However, sometimes the experience with the white balance is not satisfactory.. the cameras look bad on the handset screen, but when put. on the computer they look better. I think this is the first time I have had this experience, it's usually the opposite.. chance to modify the white balance, but despite trying to have. the hottest colors using this function, it still fails to be worth a mention in this review since the change has to be made in the eye and there are no ways or pre-established standard to. Experience with the screen brightness is good, one of the best I've ever had with a Sony device.. SwiftKey is preinstalled by default on the Xperia XA Ultra. The Xperia XA Ultra can be used with one hand. In the Xperia XA Ultra, Sony used polished. Android 6.0 Marshmallow comes installed on Xperia XA Ultra have some new elements such as a new look for the SMS application and Swiftkey keyboard as standard in place of the Xperia Keyboard.. Among the features that attract our attention, use of the device with one hand is a great option for a 6-inch device, however, you have to set it in the best possible way before going to use it.. If you kept the lock screen. you have to give two commands until you can launch the camera or dialer quickly by dragging your finger right or left will reduce the screen to use with one hand.. I must say that I did not like. especially since the use of the device with one hand already comes. And when you realize that in the midst of this. would need to quickly launch the dialer from the lock screen, the quality of user experience is reduced.. The Xperia UI also has a new lock screen and a system of apps suggestions that run. a number of pre-installed applications, some removable and others not, such as Spotify, the Kobo eBooks, Sky Go, Amazon and AVG anti-virus.. The Xperia Ultra XA could be more swift. Inside, the Xperia XA Ultra comes with the same processor as. the original intermediate Xperia X and not too exciting. for a smartphone with "Ultra" in the name.. The CPU is MediaTek Helio P10 2.0GHz octa-core chip is one for intermediaries.. The device's internal memory is 3 GB and storage is 16 GB and can be expanded up to 200GB via a microSD card.. If the smaller version of the Xperia X series graphics were already lower than expected for the GPU Helio P10, which has two cores 700 MHz. With the Xperia XA Ultra, which has a larger screen, we had almost the same points between them.. XA Ultra, the games can still run at 720p,. however, if you want to use the potential of the XA Ultra screen, which offers 1080p, the graphics will be reduced.. Recalling that the chipset architecture is the Cortex A-53 mid-range, which can justify the intermediate performance octa-core processor.. But what bothered me most was the delay to open some applications, especially in multitasking.. be improved by accelerating the range of animations in the developer options.. However, a new device with a CPU like the Helio P10 with. 3GB of RAM should not do that.. we recommend the use of a microSD card to optimize the performance of Xperia X, and this will also be the case of the XA Ultra, which comes with only 16 GB of internal storage.. Like the Xperia X, and other smartphones from. the Japanese manufacturer, the XA Ultra has a speaker slightly more acute.. Call quality is clear and we do not have that 'echo'. In the test model that Sony sent to. AndroidPIT , it did not offer the headphones in the box.. Accessing the device settings, we have the chance to use the equalizer application of Xperia UI, which has settings for bass and treble tones.. The sound of Sony's mono speaker is good, despite the metallic effect of audio when the volume is at 100% capacity.. However, the option to put it in the bottom right. What really caught my attention was the capture audio from the microphones.. I had the chance to use the device for a concert and the audio clarity was impressive.. The use of the flash in front camera helps with the quality of images. Sony offers numerous settings to optimize your photo and video experience. The front camera is best for videos and photos better with the back camera. Check here the Xperia X Ultra camera test photos in high-resolution. The Xperia XA Ultra is the unicorn of the Xperia series because. the front camera offers better results than the rear.. Unlike the Xperia Ultra C5, in which both cameras had the same sensor, the XA Ultra. front camera is 16 MP, with an f / 2.0 aperture supported by an. LED flash; while the rear camera is 21,5 MP with an aperture of f / 2.2 and. Interestingly, the 16 MP camera has an optical image stabilizer, which functions as digital stabilization. my impression is that the front camera did a much better service, even for the capture of images, since it is optimized for low light conditions.. Regarding the rear camera, when we look at the photos and videos in a software on a. computer, you can identify slight smudges or distortions in the images captured by the device.. The media captured with the front camera actually maintained decent quality.. The hybrid auto focus Xperia XA Ultra is excellent for those who like to focus on the scene and capture images quickly, however, it seemed slower than. As is traditional in Sony smartphones, the Xperia XA Ultra comes equipped with a physical button to be used as the. interesting manual mode, the Superior Auto function can be the most viable way for those who have no expertise with adjusting smartphone camera settings.. Unfortunately, I had problems when using the camera application. I encountered an error that made the software freeze. four times when I was using the front camera.. After several attempts to fix the problem without having another application use the camera in the background or something, I had to reset the machine.. say that the camera sensor then overheated.. The Xperia Ultra XA does pretty well in terms of battery. The Sony Xperia XA Ultra has a small battery capacity for its size, 2,700 mAh. In comparison, the Xperia Z5 Compact has the same 2,700mAh battery, but with a 4.6-inch screen.. In the review of the Xperia X, done. by my colleague Eric Herrmann, the device left much to be desired in the question of battery life.. But during my test with the Ultra variant, I confess that I was surprised with the capability of this unit.. The Xperia XA Ultra offers good performance when it comes to battery life, and can reach up to 8 hours of use for videos, which is. enough for a device with its specifications.. In benchmark tests, the Xperia XA Ultra performed, as shown above, like devices such as the Moto G4 Plus, Xperia X and LG G5, for example.. Additionally, the load time of the device is fast due to the use of UCH12 technology, which uses fast load support from Qualcomm.. Sony Xperia XA Ultra technical specifications. 164.2 x 79.4 x 8.4 mm. 1920 x 1080 pixels (367 ppi). This smartphone is designed for those who really want to get all the potential that a front camera can offer. The Xperia XA Ultra is better than the original variant of the series.. However, it is a phablet and there are few people who can really use a 6-inch smartphone on a daily basis.. Despite the beautiful design and a great front camera, the. Despite the good contrast and excellent viewing angles of the Xperia XA Ultra screen, colors and white balance end up hurting the user experience.. Despite the good energy battery, Sony could have offered a much larger. The Sony software is full of features and has one of the best made of Android interfaces, however, the hardware does not offer a good performance.. This smartphone is designed for those who really want to take all the potential that a front camera can offer, as well as quality audio.. But if you want a big screen for a good gaming experience, the quality of the. XA Ultra graphics does not help. Now, if you want to use the device for social media. and instant messaging networks, you will not find many problems.. The price of the Xperia XA Ultra will be known on August 10, but one thing is for. A good alternative to this device may be the. Zenfone 3 Ultra, which should reach the market in mid-September.. What do you think of the Xperia XA Ultra? Let us know in the comments.. i have the xa ultra and for some reason when i put the sd card in it is not working nothing comes up just like it wasnt there. If you compare this to the new samsung or iphone it loses in almost every category, but remember that it costs like a third of the price of those. i spent $290 on this phone and its a crazy good deal for that price. the processor and screen eat up the battery, but i prefer performance over battery conservation. The amazing qualities of this phone are the price, the performance from the octa core processor and the front camera. the average and sub average parts of this phone are the rear camera and the slowness when taking photos. the one and only very bad quality on this phone is the white balance of the screen. i live with it though since the phone is such a good deal for the price. if you want the best phone in the world, go pay $950 for an iphone or samsung. if you want an amazing phone for the price, get this phone.. The title of this really is the reverse. I own this phone, have had it for 3 months. Never had this problem with my HTC M7 or M8. It's due to apps not being suspended properly in memory.. Hi, I really like this phone & planning to buy it. My only concern is the small 2700mah battery. Can it really last a whole day? I just wonder why Sony put such a small batt in a big phone :/. The phone is on sale since last week and I've bought one since. Nice finishin.good to watch movies and social networking in a bezel less design. Audio is kinda metallic when in top volume but can make use of a good headphone😊. Battery is awesome can keep me connected all the time. Camera sensor overheating is a concern. Just open up the camera and feel the heat😛 Hope they come up with a fix soon.. I don't think better than oneplus 3... Sony has numbers on both rear and front not quality... I put oneplus 3 and ultra side by side oneplus 3 is quite natural than ultra on both sides... Poor from Sony disappointed you loss my 1299 dirhams. check gsmarena and phoneareana, they praise xa ultra camera and performace.. I trust my eyes more than gsmarena or phonearena. //while the rear camera is 5 MP with an aperture of f / 2.2 and LED flash support.// Correct this :) It's 21.5MP. Interesting, 2 tech site already review how great the rear camera for a midranger especially when you used the HDR mode in manual. and if 3 other tech sites say its not that great? Apparently AndroidPIT's results werent that great compared to other phones, that's all they say.. MWC 2018 live updates: Sony's Xperia gets a makeover. * Please enter a valid email address.
