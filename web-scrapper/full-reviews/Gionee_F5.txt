Gionee's 5.3-inch mid-ranger was recently unveiled and is now available in retail stores in China!. Last December, the Gionee F5 was featured on the benchmarking site, TENAA, which is why it leaves little to the imagination since we already know what to expect from the F5. But apparently, Gionee had more tricks upon their sleeves than we gave them credit for.. Gionee launched the F5, which in all fairness is a dashing smartphone with a 5.3-inch IPS display (720p resolution) and is powered by an MT6750 SoC, paired with an octa-core Cortex-A53 processor, Mali-T860MP2 GPU, accompanied by 4GB of RAM.. Camera-wise, the F5 is equipped with a standard pair of shooters, namely; a 13MP rear camera with the ever-handy LED Flash, and 8MP placed out front for selfies. The device runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box and carries the hottest Amigo Launcher there is.. Gionee packed in a 4,000mAh battery to keep the handset lit, which is available in China, with two amazing color options, gold, and a type of rosy gold. The F5 is surprisingly priced at CNY 1,799 (roughly USD260). Which is funny because it costs twice but does not have a big difference specs-wise nor a clinching factor when compared to the Meizu M5 .. Aside from the pricing issue, everything is smooth and easy going, though there is no news as to whether the F5 will be available in other markets outside China..
