Weighing just about 135 grams, the 66.6 x 132.8 x 8.95 mm dimension gives the set a very handy appeal that can be easily held in hands as well as carried in pockets. Since its launch in Philippines a few years back, Oppo smartphones have successfully managed to gain as much popularity as the renowned, world-famous brands that have taken so many years to reach this position. It is because of the precision of their designs, models, incorporating as well as updating of configurations, along with greatly affordable prices that this brand has achieved such a position..

This OS gives the sets greater and more active organization of the apps that the user uses or downloads. One of their latest models is from their Joy series, namely Joy 3..

Just by picking their phone up and holding it on to their ears, the call would be received. In case of a need to mute that call, no need to press any button.

Updated On: 26th February 2018. 3.4 38 Ratings 3 Questions & Answers. Oppo Joy 3 is an Android 4.4 KitKat smartphone with dual SIM slots. It features a 4.5-inch LCD display with a resolution of 854x480 pixels. The phone is powered by a 1.3GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6582 processor. It has 1GB of RAM , 4GB of internal storage , and a microSD slot for expansion. The device comes with a 5 MP rear camera and a 2 MP front-facing camera. The Oppo Joy 3 supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, and 3G connectivity. The battery is a 2,000 mAh unit.. Key Specifications MT6582 processor 1GB RAM 4GB internal storage 2000 mAh battery 5 M.Pixels rear & 2 M.Pixels selfie 4.5 inches inch screen Dual SIM Android OS, v4.4 (KitKat). Oppo Joy 3 Price in India. Oppo Joy 3 Price starts at Rs. The Oppo Joy 3 is the successor to the Oppo Joy, with just the right amount of upgrades in the things that matter, such memory, operating system, and the camera.. The smartphone runs Android 4.4 KitKat, with Oppo's Color OS 2.0 UI adding additional features. The most notable includes the support for gestures when the screen is off: users can double tap on the phone's display to wake it up, swipe on it with two fingers to play or pause music, and draw a circle to instantly open the camera. Oppo also adds a few camera features like Beautify and Audio Photo, and the phone comes with a design that is more premium than other devices in the price range.. The Oppo Joy 3 increases the screen size from the original to 4.5-inches, though the resolution remains more or less the same at 854x480 pixels. As a result, the screen might be considerably less sharp, though it should suffice for most viewing purposes. A quad-core MediaTek MT6582 CPU clocked at 1.3GHz handles the processing part, and thanks to the low display resolution, should be adept at powering through all but the most demanding of use cases. There is 1GB of RAM, which is double of what the original Oppo Joy had and should ensure sufficient multitasking for most users.. On the imaging front, the Joy 3 comes with a 5-megapixel camera on the back for taking pictures and shooting videos, with Oppo's custom camera modes adding to the experience. The front camera is a 2-megapixel unit that can take selfies and allow users to make video calls via web services like Skype and Google Hangouts. To store photos, users can take advantage of the 4GB of internal storage, which can also be used to install apps. A microSD slot can allow you to expand available storage, with up to 32GB cards supported by the device.. The Joy 3 comes with a 2,000 mAh battery that should be able to last through the day on light to medium usage, but might left the user wanting if they are using their device continuously for long periods of time. The device supports all the standard connectivity options, including 3G (only one SIM slot supports 3G), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS.. Please ask the question in above box. What is the camera megapixel of this phone?. As far as the cameras are concerned, the Oppo Joy 3 packs a 5-megapixel primary camera on the rear and a 2-megapixel front shooter for selfies..

The 480 x 854 and 4.5 inch long display makes the visual experience very pleasing for the eyes. With an Android 4.4 KitKat version, operating this particular model becomes absolutely easy. Weighing just about 135 grams, the 66.6 x 132.8 x 8.95 mm dimension gives the set a very handy appeal that can be easily held in hands as well as carried in pockets. Since its launch in India a few years back, OPPO smartphones have successfully managed to gain as much popularity as the renowned, world-famous brands that have taken so many years to reach this position. It is because of the precision of their designs, models, incorporating as well as updating of configurations, along with greatly affordable prices that this brand has achieved such a position..

Gadget review: Oppo Joy 3 A11W It’s sleek, light and fast. For an entry-level phone on a shoestring budget, Joy 3 packs in almost all the basic features — office essentials, a (rather strong) flashlight, sound recorder and radio.. Updated: Sep 22, 2015 14:12 IST. Review: Oppo Joy 3 A11W is sleek, light and fast. But if you’re shutter-happy, this isn’t for you. QUICK SPECS What: Oppo Joy 3 A11W At a glance: Android KitKat version, 1 GB RAM, 5MP primary camera USP: Battery power and multitasking Best buy: Rs 7,990 at Oppo stores, retail outlets Rating: ***. In the past, Oppo’s smartphones have received positive reviews for their innovativeness and competitive pricing. So we had high expectations from their new entry-level phone, Oppo Joy 3 A11W and we weren’t disappointed. Available in grey and white metallic finish, the phone is as lightweight and sleek as any other smartphone in the market. Moreover, the phone supports an expandable memory of up to 32GB to ensure there’s no space crunch, ever.. What’s good : For an entry-level phone on a shoestring budget, Joy 3 packs in almost all the basic features — office essentials, a (rather strong) flashlight, sound recorder and radio. However, its biggest positive is the strong 2,000mAh battery — it easily lasts for a day even after heavy use. The lightweight phone is easy to hold, and the 4.5 inch display is crisp. Surprisingly, the 1GB RAM functions smoothly too — we put it to the test with Android’s KitKat version and ran multiple applications. What’s not : With phone cameras gaining prominence, people ditch DSLRs for smartphones. However, Joy 3’s 5MP primary camera is its biggest setback. Even the 2MP front camera is disappointing as it comes with preloaded filters and the colour balance/contrast is poor. The post-editing options are limited as well.. Verdict : Oppo Joy 3 is a feasible option if you are looking for a fast, entry-level smartphone. However, if you want a good camera phone, you should explore other options..

Easily wake up your device by double tapping the screen. It is highly unlikely that Oppo would come to deal in budget smartphone segment, considering that most of its offerings have boasted some of the coolest, if weird, features that can be found on smartphones today. But here is Oppo with a budget smartphone named Joy 3 and it has us glued to our screens to find out just what does this smartphone have. It is strange to find out that this smartphone does not have the kind of tricks one finds on Oppo's high-end smartphones, but that can be understood considering the budget constraints it has had to face to come up with such a smartphone. The Oppo Joy 3 sports a quad-core processor, clocked at 1.3GHz, inside its polycarbonate shell and it has been paired with 1GB RAM. The Joy 3 runs on Android 4.4.4 KitKat with Oppo's proprietary Color OS 2.0 skin on top and it is capable of handling two SIM cards at the same time. There is no information available from Oppo as to whether the Joy 3 will receive Android 5.0 Lollipop update or not, though we think it would be rolled out soon. The Joy 3 sports 3G network capabilities and that is boon for a lot fo users who prefer to stay connected wherever they go. The Oppo Joy 3 sports a screen measuring 4.5 inches across and it puts out display resolution of 854x480 pixels. The Joy 3 sports a 5-megapixel camera on its back and it has been paired with a 2MP camera that takes care of duties on the front of the smartphone. The Oppo Joy 3 comes with 4GB internal memory and it can be expanded further up to 32GB with the help of a microSD card. The Joy 3 is powered by a 2000mAh capacity battery and while no performance ratings are available for the same, we think it would be able to survive for close to 8 hours of usage on a single full charge. The only problem we have with Joy 3 is the lack of information on whether it has Oppo's VOOC technology for its battery or not. Apart from that, it is among those smartphones that you can opt for with your eyes closed as they are made with highest levels of quality in mind.. Oppo Joy 3 Price in India. 11,999 .00.
