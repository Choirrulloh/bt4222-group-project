Even the HTC one from 2014 is better than this garbage... HTC is really taking a step in the wrong direction with the way they make their phones.. I had this phone in June. The one with the bigger battery and stuff is an improvement over the one pictured since it had a Snapdragon 400 Which are old CPU's for a phone and even a Pentium 4 Can outrun it in the performance sector.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. by Daniel Petrov. HTC - HTC + Android - Android +. 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction Today, sub-$200 phones aren't what they used to be, and HTC is proving the point with the good looking, two-tone Desire 650. A successor to the 630, the new entry level device comes with HTC staples like front BoomSound speakers and “hi-res” audio. It also takes an interesting design twist with a half-smooth, half-groove rear cover, but does what's under the hood perform well enough to warrant a purchase? Let's find out... Design The BoomSound set makes the Desire 650 a bit big for a 5-incher The Desire 650 exhibits a very HTC-compliant design, with five enormous front openings in the top and bottom bezel indicating there are BoomSound speakers there, and a huge camera lens circle on the back. It is made entirely of plastic, yet is not particularly light or compact for a 5-incher, on account of the sizable top and bottom bezels housing the BoomSound set. The soft-touch rear is grooved at the lower half for better traction and a more interesting look. Inserting a SIM card, or swapping your microSD when full are easy actions to do on the Desire 650, as there is simply a flap on the left covering both slots, and it is easy to pry open. We liked that the SIM card is hot swappable, so you don't need to switch off the phone to change it (looking at you, Sony ), and the Desire 650 automatically picks the carrier settings and sets the language according to the area. Display You get what you pay for with the Desire 650's display, which sports credible colors, but is dim and reflective A 720 x 1280 pixels resolution screen is all you get with the Desire 650, which isn't surprising given the phone's price point, and at a 5” diagonal returns good enough pixel density for most tasks. The LCD display offers fairly credible color presentation that doesn't venture to the cold or warm side too much. It is rather dim for today's LCD standards, though, at barely 368 nits of peak brightness, and pretty reflective, so outdoor visibility under direct sunlight is a bit of a struggle. At 12 nits minimum brightness it is hardly comfortable to read on at night, too. The viewing angles also don't impress, as contrast and color shift significantly when the phone gets tilted, and reflections abound.. 5.78 x 2.79 x 0.33 inches. 146.9 x 70.9 x 8.4 mm. 5.96 x 2.97 x 0.31 inches. 151.35 x 75.35 x 7.85 mm. 5.78 x 2.79 x 0.32 inches. 146.9 x 70.9 x 8.19 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. HTC Desire 650 Compare.

The 32-Bit Snapdragon 400 with 'mighty' ARM Cortex-A7s clocked at an EXTREME 1.6Ghz and an EXTREMELY powerful Adreno 405 GPU that'll put the GPU inside the PlayStation 4 to shame and an extremely high speed DDR2-SD RAM clocked at a SKY HIGH 533 MHz...

HTC Desire 650 - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 4 ». Have to say I was a little skeptical about getting one of these and I finally bit the bullet and got one and its great, chose this because the design is different to the normal Iphone lookalikes these days and wanted something different, I am quite satisfied with it.. Even the HTC one from 2014 is better than this garbage... HTC is really taking a step in the wrong direction with the way they make their phones.. I had this phone in June. The one with the bigger battery and stuff is an improvement over the one pictured since it had a Snapdragon 400 Which are old CPU's for a phone and even a Pentium 4 Can outrun it in the performance sector. The improved one that has the middle camera has a Mediatek CPU as far as i know. The Snapdragon 400 Version has many issues such as a bad battery life, Laggy UI. Until HTC Stops making phones with promises such as 2 year Update cycles and then not bringing an update at all. All these phones they made in the Desire series aren't good at all. If you need a budget phone then get any Samsung J Or A Series device or even a 1 or 2 year old S Series and shove a new rom on it. An A5 2017 Is good or an LG G6 Or q6. This phone has a surprisingly good camera!. My daily phone is an HTC 10 but when I went on holiday to South Africa I was scared to lose it and got an HTC Desire 650 to use there to take photos and use for Whatsapp. Well I was so impressed! This Desire 650 took clear, colourful photos that really popped! It worked well as an all rounder and I hardly ever brought out the HTC 10 as the 650 was just as capable and quite rugged without having to have a case on. So I would say that this is the perfect holiday phone or backup phone..

Opiniones y Comentarios HTC Desire 650. Hay 6 opiniones del HTC Desire 650 .. Voy directo al punto que me importa. Yo quiero saber porque si no tengo ningun juego me cobran i sol mas diario, bueno, eso creo depende del servidor que use. Quisiera saber que o como hacer para transferir mis fotos a mi cuenta y ppoder verlas desde cualquier computador o laptop, eso he tratado de hacer ahora y ya me duele la cabeza de tanto intentarlo. Me dicen tambien que el clean master(el de la brochita) bajado del mismo aparato gratuitamente es maloporque trae viruses? y que tengo que comprar uno en google play. CUando hado limpieza al iniciar el dia o al finalizarlo me dice que facebook ocupa mucho espacio, pues yo tenia un juego descargado allo que me decia lo mismo, me sale limpiar datos, eso hice con mi juego y lo perdi, cuando me sale documentos predeterminados he de eliminarlos?, como hago , y ya para terminar, abrir una carpeta con todas mis fotos y videos que me envian al whatssap o messenger. Gracias por vuestra atencion y espero no haberlos cansado. es bueno el cell pero cuando estoy con el hand free la llamada entra de golpe y el timbrado es muy fuerte hay que estar atento para bajar el volumen cada vez que uso hand free hay alguna forma que automaticamente regule el sonido del auricular para evitar daños al oido. A mi en lo personal me encanto el cel es veloz y puedo jugar juegos 3d sin que se trabe y sin que se vea en camara lenta, las fotos pudieran salir un poco mejor sin embargo la camara no es algo que a mi me importe mucho. Precioso teléfono, funciona de maravilla, la velocidad con la que me responden las aplicaciones que utilizo es excelente, gracias a su procesador y ram incorporada, la cam, la conectividad wifi, y absolutamente todo en el equipo es más que excelente.. adquirí un HTC desire 650 pero he buscado ka función del reproductor de música y no lo trae solo en la función de bloqueo pero al bloquearse completamente se apaga la funcion. Ya desde ese punto deja de ser el móvil deseado para mi. Ver todas las Opiniones del HTC Desire 650 - Total de opiniones de usuarios: 6.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. by Daniel Petrov. HTC - HTC + Android - Android +. 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. Interface and functionality The HTC Sense interface on Desire 650 is very close to the stock Android 6.1 Marshmallow build underneath. The notification shade is taken verbatim, for instance, but there are a few extras thrown in to differentiate like HTC's own theming engine and toolbox folder with things like a Boost+ “ phone optimizer” app and a flashlight toggle. There is a 3-finger swipe gesture from the screen bottom that calls up the DLNA app for media output to a larger screen, too. Another one of these HTC interface add-ons is the BlinkFeed screen to the left, which serves as a news and social feeds aggregator you can tailor to your own desires. Other than those, HTC counts chiefly on Google 's default apps for most everyday tasks. Processor and memory Running the Desire 650 show is a middling quad-core Snapdragon 400 chipset, clocked at 1.6 GHz, which is enough to push through the clean, simplified interface without much hiccups. With 2 GB of RAM provided, however, don't expect apps to open without loading waits, or your BlinkFeed to update as fast as you can scroll – it's a process. HTC provides the expected for the phone's price point 16 GB of internal storage, of which about 10 GB are user available from the get-go, so you might want to make use of the memory card slot on the left hand side. Internet and connectivity HTC has expropriated Android's stock Chrome browser for its Internet needs, which runs fine, with only a few scroll stutters here and there when several tabs are open. To get you on the Internet, the Desire 650 offers Wi-Fi/n, or 9 LTE bands, including US ones, with download speeds up to 150 Mbps, and uploads up to 50 Mbps.
