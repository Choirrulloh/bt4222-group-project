Esto también se puede leer en español.. An Android phone with '3D Touch'? (hands-on). Gionee's newly unveiled S8 makes an appearance at Mobile World Congress touting a feature that previously belonged only to Apple's phones.. by February 24, 2016 1:37 PM PST. Gionee S8 is the first Android phone with 3D Touch (pictures). What you should know Has a feature similar to Apple's 3D Touch, but limited to just menus Slim metal body draws the eye Supports two WhatsApp accounts Fingerprint sensor on the home button Hardware specs 1.9GHz MediaTek MT 6755 Helio P10 octa-core processor 5.5-inch AMOLED full-HD with 3D Touch Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow software 6.07 by 2.95 by 0.28 inches (154.3 by 74.9 by 7 mm) 5.19 ounces (147 grams) 4GB RAM, 32GB onboard storage Dual SIM, 4G connectivity 16-megapixel rear camera, 8-megapixel front. It's a favorite Mobile World Congress pastime of mine to visit the stands of upstart Chinese phones manufacturers hoping to get noticed. That's why I cruised by Gionee's booth to see what the company had to offer. Though it lacks the international presence of Xiaomi or Huawei, Gionee has been doing pretty well in China and India. And here in Barcelona it took the sheets off its new Gionee S8 phone.. With a shiny but not unusual metal-clad body, there's not much about the S8 that immediately catches your eye. Rather, the story here is something a lot of Chinese Android phones have in common -- a strong resemblance, either in features or in design, to Apple's iPhone. The S8 definitely has the "iLooks" down, but more interesting is that it has its own version of 3D Touch.. On the iPhone 6S , 3D Touch is a pressure-sensitive display that lets you press down onto the screen to interact with it, calling up quick menus or preview links. Fully push down on a link and it opens up into a new normal window. In theory, it sounds like a great feature, but of all the iPhone things for the S8 to borrow, I wish Gionee had picked something else.. The home button also doubles up as a fingerprint sensor.. Putting aside the fact that I hardly ever use 3D Touch even on my iPhone, on the S8 it's way too limited. There's no peeking to do, as it only opens quick menus on the default apps. If you try it with other apps, such as Google's or those downloaded from the Play Store, the feature just simply doesn't work.. Honestly, the S8 would be better without it as the phone sports some redeeming features that would be far more useful. It comes with dual SIM support as well as support for dual WhatsApp accounts. The latter enables two instances to run on two different numbers at the same time, so messaging addicts will be able to message themselves. It's easily done by using 3D Touch on the WhatsApp app and clicking on the clone option.. If you're still interested, Gionee's retailing the S8 for €449, which converts to about $495, £350 or AU$685. It will be sold in China and India soon, and will make its way to Europe as well.. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

more ... more .... more ... more .... posted by Luis D.. Tags :. Gionee might sound esoteric and unfamiliar to many of you, for the brand mostly sells its handsets in China and India. But if you ever held a sleek phone from a brand like AllView, BLU, Kazam, or Walton, then congratulations – you've caught a wild Gionee phone in re-branded disguise!. At this year's MWC, the Chinese smartphone maker introduced a promising new device – the Gionee S8. It's a sleek phone with some interesting design and functionality features alongside a powerful camera. Let's have a look at what Gionee has been up to this time! Design Superficially, the S8 is a slim, tall, and pleasantly light aluminum rectangle that invokes comparisons with the Sony Xperia series' stern, symmetric design. But a closer look shows there's a bit more going on here. The back panel has the antenna bands form a continuous loop around its sides, which is a clever and aesthetically pleasing way of incorporating them into the design. There's also a circular surface that's metallic and embossed with Gionee's emoji-inspired new logo. You will certainly mistake it for a fingerprint scanner, but in reality, the sensor is embedded in the Home button on the front. The scanner works quickly and reliably. On the sides, we have power and volume keys on the right (they are nice and tight), the SIM tray is on the left, and the bottom is home to the mono speaker, USB Type-C port, and earphone jack. Display The S8 has 5.5-inch, 1080 x 1920 px resolution AMOLED display, but this isn't what all the fuss is about. Rather, Gionee has pulled off a semi-authentic clone of the iPhone 6s' 3D Touch shortcuts – still a rarity among Android phones. The feature discerns between three levels of pressure – Touch, Tap, and Press. A robust tap on an app lets you access its essential functionality, while force-pressing near the screen 's left or right edge yields you a customizable shortcut bar.. The latter is inspired by Samsung 's 'Edge bar' functionality, and maybe it's just a matter of getting used to it, but we had trouble triggering the sidebar reliably. The force touch wallpapers that animate when you force-press them are kind of cool, but you must apply unnecessarily strong pressure, which is annoying. Interface Gionee's Amigo user interface is an inconsistent (at times) amalgam of stock Android Marshmallow applications and visuals in brownish hues reminiscent of Huawei's Emotion UI. While Amigo is in need of further polishing (for example, scrolling is a little awkward), it's on its way to becoming a colorful and lively interface. It's also very speedy and stripped of clutter, bar the sizable selection of Chinese apps and services that are featured prominently on our unit.. Image: 1 of 24. The lock screen shows lifestyle content every time you turn on the display. there's no app drawer (in line with modern Chinese phones), and uninstalling apps happens exactly like it does on iOS, which is a mildly amusing sight on an Android device. Processor and Memory The Gionee S8 is one fast smartphone, despite being powered by MediaTek's mid-range Helio P10 SoC. Housing an octa-core 1.9GHz CPU and the Mali-T860MP2 GPU, the chip is paired with a hefty 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage. In order to pop in a microSD card, though, you'll have to part with one of the two SIM card slots. Performance is generally great, with menus and browsing going fast. Alas, Asphalt 8 wouldn't run at all for some reason, and the 52,278 AnTuTu score we got is below average for a modern phone, which means heavier 3D games are out of the Gionee S8's reach. Camera The phone comes with a 16MP main camera that's kept company by an LED flash and laser auto-focus module. It's a competent unit with wide f/1.8 aperture, 6-part lens and phase-detection autofocus. The front camera is an 8MP unit. We're fond of the camera app and the photos we shot. The app is fast and straightforward, but also fitted with plenty of filters and shooting modes you need (though manual isn't an option). Photos are taken in an instant and generally look fine, although the color balance is a bit on the colder side. Selfies turned out quite fine as well.. Expectations Priced at around $395 (CNY 2,599) in China and neighboring countries, and commanding price tags north of 450 USD/EUR outside Asia, the Gionee S8 might have a hard time seducing smartphone users unless they are devoted fans of the brand. There are plenty of cheaper, better spec'd, and still pretty devices like the Xiaomi Mi 5 on the side of China and India, and phones like the Galaxy S6, Xperia Z5, and Nexus 6P globally. Overall, the S8 is a fine showcase of Gionee's talent for crafting sleek phones with a lifestyle edge, but the price is steep and the user interface is in need of polish.. At a glance, the Elephone P9000 has it all – nice design, a big screen, up-to-date specs and software,.... Global travelers might find the Spark as an attractive option, given the fact that it’s GSM unlocked.... Sony Xperia XZ2 impressions: Gone with the old, in with the new.

We got to spend some time with the smartphone, and you can check out our initial impressions in the video.. The Gionee S8 features 3D Touch (yes, the same name Apple uses) pressure sensitive display, one of the biggest highlights of the smartphone, and is expected to work same as the new iPhone models. The company says that the smartphone can sense 3 levels of force including touch to select an app, tap to preview the content of an app, and press to run the app.. Another notable feature is a loop metal design, and the floating window interface.

Smile! It’s the Gionee S8, and that’s the expression that’ll make you want it. Gionee says its new smartphone is a smilephone, and that's why you'll buy it. gorgeous metal phone with distinct visual flair and a 3D Touch screen, but nearly ruins. borrowing too heavily from Apple for the UI. This time last year, Chinese company Gionee turned up at Mobile World Congress with the super slim Elife S7 , and in 2016, it’s back not only with the sequel, but also a completely new brand identity. Gionee says it has worked out what makes us buy certain types of smartphones (by which it means Apple phones), and it’s because they make us smile. Armed with this information, it has come up with a new logo and the Gionee S8 — which it often referred to as the ‘smilephone.’ Yep, really.. Did the Gionee S8 make us smile? Yes, it absolutely did, but not always for the best reasons.. That’s great, but then it becomes the only question that’s important: Did the Gionee S8 make us smile? Yes, it absolutely did, but not always for the best reasons. On the positive side, the Gionee S8 is beautifully made. That’s not new for the company either, the models we’ve reviewed in the past have always been top-notch. It’s made of a smooth metal, and rather than stretch the antenna bars across the body, it has run them around the edge of the device. This cleans up the back of the phone, and frames the body nicely. It’s very light and only 7mm thick, but still manages to fit in a 3000mAh battery. It measures 5.5-inches and has a 1080p resolution, and because it’s an AMOLED panel, it looks great. The Amigo user interface hasn’t made us smile in the past, and it’s version 3.2 installed here. It has many annoying alterations — putting the quick access buttons in a drawer that’s pulled up from the screen rather than down, for example —but it did at least feel fluid and smooth in our quick tests. The screen has 3D Touch, adding pressure sensitive shortcuts to certain apps, just like the iPhone 6S. It’s not the only similarity, the shortcut menu is almost identical to the one used by Apple in iOS. It’s actually almost too close for comfort. We still smiled, but not not in a good way. It’s also limited to only a few apps, and for animating the live wallpaper.. There’s plenty of connectivity options, including VoLTE and Cat 6 LTE, plus some interesting new apps. For example, you can clone WhatsApp — because it’s not possible to install two versions of the app on a single Android phone — because the phone has dual-SIM slots, so you can have a separate WhatsApp account for each number. Gionee really pushed the S8’s camera, boasting about video editing features, a slow motion mode, and a new beauty mode for selfies. These we’ve seen before, but the RWB 16-megapixel sensor supposedly improves low-light photography without increasing the backlight, resulting in better images. That’s new, and not something we’ve tried before.. The MediaTek octa-core Helio P10 processor is also new, and there’s a massive 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage space, plus a MicroSD card slot inside the dual-SIM tray. It’s a strong package, and we really liked the design and in-hand comfort, but as with previous Gionee phones it may be difficult to actually buy. It’s going on sale in the next few months for 450 euros, but there’s no word of a wide international launch. That means looking for an importer if you really want one.. Adding up the smiles, the S8 did manage more happy smiles than condescending ones, which means Gionee may be onto something with its research..

It’s the Gionee S8, and that’s the expression that’ll make you want it. gorgeous metal phone with distinct visual flair and a 3D Touch screen, but nearly ruins. borrowing too heavily from Apple for the UI. This time last year, Chinese company Gionee turned up at Mobile World Congress with the super slim Elife S7 , and in 2016, it’s back not only with the sequel, but also a completely new brand identity. Gionee says it has worked out what makes us buy certain types of smartphones (by which it means Apple phones), and it’s because they make us smile. Armed with this information, it has come up with a new logo and the Gionee S8 — which it often referred to as the ‘smilephone.’ Yep, really.. That’s great, but then it becomes the only question that’s important: Did the Gionee S8 make us smile? Yes, it absolutely did, but not always for the best reasons. On the positive side, the Gionee S8 is beautifully made. That’s not new for the company either, the models we’ve reviewed in the past have always been top-notch. It’s made of a smooth metal, and rather than stretch the antenna bars across the body, it has run them around the edge of the device. This cleans up the back of the phone, and frames the body nicely. It’s very light and only 7mm thick, but still manages to fit in a 3000mAh battery. Related: The Blu Pure XL is a Gionee phone in disguise, and here’s our review. It measures 5.5-inches and has a 1080p resolution, and because it’s an AMOLED panel, it looks great. The Amigo user interface hasn’t made us smile in the past, and it’s version 3.2 installed here. It has many annoying alterations — putting the quick access buttons in a drawer that’s pulled up from the screen rather than down, for example —but it did at least feel fluid and smooth in our quick tests. The screen has 3D Touch, adding pressure sensitive shortcuts to certain apps, just like the iPhone 6S. It’s not the only similarity, the shortcut menu is almost identical to the one used by Apple in iOS. It’s actually almost too close for comfort. We still smiled, but not not in a good way. It’s also limited to only a few apps, and for animating the live wallpaper.. There’s plenty of connectivity options, including VoLTE and Cat 6 LTE, plus some interesting new apps. For example, you can clone WhatsApp — because it’s not possible to install two versions of the app on a single Android phone — because the phone has dual-SIM slots, so you can have a separate WhatsApp account for each number. Gionee really pushed the S8’s camera, boasting about video editing features, a slow motion mode, and a new beauty mode for selfies. These we’ve seen before, but the RWB 16-megapixel sensor supposedly improves low-light photography without increasing the backlight, resulting in better images. That’s new, and not something we’ve tried before.. Highs: High-tech camera Clever antenna design Bright AMOLED screen 3D Touch Lows: 3D Touch isn’t utilized enough UI borrows from Apple LG G5’s Hi-Fi Plus audio module is like an ammo clip for astounding audio The new Lumia 650’s gorgeous, but isn’t powerful enough for Continuum Is Amazon trying to sabotage Google’s Android, despite relying on it?. The MediaTek octa-core Helio P10 processor is also new, and there’s a massive 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage space, plus a MicroSD card slot inside the dual-SIM tray. It’s a strong package, and we really liked the design and in-hand comfort, but as with previous Gionee phones it may be difficult to actually buy. It’s going on sale in the next few months for 450 euros, but there’s no word of a wide international launch. That means looking for an importer if you really want one.. Adding up the smiles, the S8 did manage more happy smiles than condescending ones, which means Gionee may be onto something with its research.. Silicon Valley is so expensive that even Facebook and Apple employees can't afford to live near the office. Apple is working on high-end headphones that may launch as soon as this year (AAPL).
