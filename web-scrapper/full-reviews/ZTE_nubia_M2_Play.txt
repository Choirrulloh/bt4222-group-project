On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. ZTE is short for Zhong Xing Telecommunication Equipment Company Limited, which was founded in China in 1985. The product range includes, for example, USB sticks, routers, smartphones and tablets.. The ratings of the relatively many reviews have a wide range from below-average to very good (as of 2016).. Similar devices from a different Manufacturer. Honor Holly 4 Plus Adreno 505.

ZTE nubia M2 Play with 5MP wide-angle selfie shooter launched. ZTE's sub-brand nubia launches its newest selfie-focused offering, the nubia M2 Play. The latest device features a 5-megapixel front-facing shooter with 84-degree wide-angle lens which is perfect for taking family selfies.. ZTE's subsidiary nubia recently expanded its M2 series of smartphones by launching the latest nubia M2 Play in China. The device is rightly referred to as the watered-down version of the nubia M2 but is still quite better than the "sugar-free" nubia M2 lite. Design-wise, it is somewhat similar to both the M2 and M2 lite having a metal body and curved glass sitting atop of the display. It also has a single camera module placed on the back panel and a physical home button up front where the fingerprint scanner is embedded.. Regarding the specs, the nubia M2 Play sports a 5.5-inch LCD touchscreen with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels and a pixel density of 274ppi. It ships with Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 octa-core processor paired with Adreno 505 GPU under the hood. It packs 3GB of RAM and 32GB internal flash storage which supports up to 128GB of expandable memory via microSD card. To compare, the nubia M2 lite arrived last March with a MediaTek Helio P10 chipset on board with a similar octa-core processor and two storage variants: 3GB and 4GB. As for the platform, it runs on Android 7.0 Nougat with nubia's in-house UI 5.0 on top.. On the camera department, the nubia M2 Play features a 13-megapixel Sony CMOS sensor with a f/2.2 aperture on the back. Primary camera features include NeoVision 6.0 and hybrid autofocus. The front-facing camera is a 5-megapixel shooter with an aperture of f/2.4 and 84-degree wide-angle lens. Surely, this new selfie-oriented handset will grab the attention of many teenagers. As for the connectivity options, the phone offers 4G VoLTE, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n/ac, GPS, and GLONASS. There's also a microUSB port and a 3.5mm audio jack that sits on the top. Everything is backed up by a 3000mAh non-removable battery.. The nubia M2 Play comes in two color variants, namely Black and Gold. Pricing and availability of the smartphone are not yet known as of the moment. Will you be the first reviewer of this product? Please share your experience..
