Blackberry Motion review: A KEYone without the keyboard. by Lanh Nguyen December 14, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Stock-like Android experience with useful BlackBerry add-ons. Camera performs poorly in low light. Blackberry Motion : A KEYone without the keyboard. The BlackBerry Motion takes the DNA of the BlackBerry KEYone, adds a bigger battery, IP67 water and dust resistance, and loses the keyboard in favor of an all touchscreen design. It has all the right components to continue the momentum created by the KEYone but could potentially be held back by it's limited availability.. Display 5.5-inch Full HD IPS LCD. microSD slot - up to 2TB. 12 MP sensor, 1.55 Î¼m pixel size, and f/2.0 aperture, phase detection autofocus. 8 MP sensor, 1.12 Î¼m pixel size, and f/2.2 aperture. IP rating IP67 water and dust resistance. Connectivity Wi-Fi 802.11 a, b, g, n, ac. Dimensions and weight 155.7 mm x 75.4 mm x 8.13 mm. BlackBerry made a triumphant return into the smartphone space with the BlackBerry KEYone , a phone that brought the modern Android experience with the classic BlackBerry physical keyboard. The new BlackBerry Motion looks to continue that momentum by bumping up the specs in a few key areas and losing the physical keyboard.. Although the keyboard is one of the best and most iconic features of a BlackBerry, it certainly doesn’t appeal to everyone. For those that want the BlackBerry KEYone experience, sans the keyboard the BlackBerry Motion is here to fill that void.. The question is: does a BlackBerry without a physical keyboard still feel like a BlackBerry or does it just turn into your average Android phone? Find out in our full BlackBerry Motion review!. One thing that you have to commend BlackBerry for is not being afraid to do something different. In an era where bezel-less displays, dual cameras, and curvy, sleek pebble-like designs are all the rage, the BlackBerry Motion bucks those trends.. It all starts with the phone’s design. Instead of a rounded glass or metal slab, the Blackberry Motion goes for a more industrial look with chamfered edges and metal sides that are completely flat. The only exception is the top portion of the phone which is one of the few areas that has some sort of curvature.. One thing that you have to commend BlackBerry for is not being afraid to do something different. The backside features a faux carbon fiber pattern that not only looks great but is soft to the touch and gives the phone plenty of grip.Â. It’s not the most comfortable or sleek feeling phone in the hand, as the hard, sharp edges makes the phone feel very blocky. But it’s refreshing to see a design that doesn’t fall in line with the Samsungs, LGs, and Apples of the world.. The build quality however rivals even the most top tier of smartphones. Every part of the BlackBerry Motion feels sturdy including the volume, power, and BlackBerry’s signature convenience key. They’re all constructed from metal giving them a satisfying click and the convenience key has a ridged texture to avoid confusion with the power or volume keys.. Due to the Motion’s all-touch screen design, there’s no physical space bar this time to function as a fingerprint sensor like there was on the KEYone. Instead, the Motion has a fingerprint sensor designated by the BlackBerry logo on the bottom chin. This doubles as a physical home button.. The fingerprint sensor is fast to unlock and very accurate but it was weird to use a phone with a physical clicking home button again as most phones with front facing fingerprint readers nowadays feature no moving parts. This home button also functions as a trackpad of sorts allowing access to the notification shade with a swipe down and the app drawer with a swipe up.. Flanking the home button are capacitive keys which fill up the bottom chin quite nicely. They are larger than on most other Android phones with capacitive keys and this also makes them much easier to press.. With no physical keyboard, the Blackberry Motion has much more room for a larger display. The screen is an LCD panel that measures in at 5.5 inches and a resolution of 1080p making the Motion a much better smartphone for media consumption compared to the KEYone. The screen is fairly bright, vibrant in color, and has excellent viewing angles, but lacks the darker blacks and contrast ratio of an AMOLED screen. Due to its more traditional bezel size, it also won’t be an attention grabber if that’s what you’re looking for.. Despite the bezels, it's still a very enjoyable display. Despite the bezels, it’s still a very enjoyable display and provides plenty of space for productivity and having fun in your downtime with the occasional game or YouTube video. The screen is constructed from DragonTrail glass for added toughness and resistance against scratches, but the durability coating is tacky to the touch and makes the screen much more difficult to keep free of fingerprints.. Inside, the BlackBerry Motion features the same Snapdragon 625 processor and 4 gigabytes of RAM as its keyboard-fitted brother KEYone, That might be a little disappointing if you were hoping for flagship-tier specifications. While it may not be the most powerful smartphone on the market and won’t blow your mind when it comes to benchmarks, the Motion still performs admirably in day to day use. You will notice the occasional stutter when the phone is under heavy load and some slight rubber banding when swiping or scrolling. but for most daily tasks such as launching applications, checking emails web browsing, or playing graphically demanding games, the Motion is more than capable.. Where the Motion lacks in specifications, it makes up for it in hardware. On the bottom side is the standard USB Type-C port that’s flanked by a single speaker, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack, a port that has become a rarity in 2017.. In terms of storage the Motion comes in a 32GB configuration but is expandable via microSD. Without a porous physical keyboard, BlackBerry was able to make the Motion IP67 dust and water-resistant, a feature that has become more and more common place in smartphones.. One of the biggest pros to the Motion is its generous battery capacity. The Motion is equipped with a massive 4,000 mAh cell and that, combined with the Snapdragon 625’s battery sipping properties, is a recipe for long lasting battery life. The Motion consistently lasts me a full two days on a single charge and screen on time easily hits the 6 hour mark. My usage is quite heavy with several hours of gaming and YouTube watching per day on top of more typical activities such as reading emails, texting, and keeping tabs on social media and I’ve been very impressed with how long the Motion lasts despite my usage.. Wireless charging is not available despite a non-metal backside, but the phone does come with the standard Qualcomm QuickCharge 3.0 for easy top offs or fill ups.. The BlackBerry Motion comes with the same set of cameras as the KEYone. There’s an 8 megapixel front facing shooter that works decently enough for selfies and a 12 megapixel camera on the rear. In terms of features, the camera app is very basic offering only a handful of modes such as panorama and slow motion video. If you’re a fan of portrait mode or background defocusing effects that other smartphone cameras offer, you won’t find anything of the like on the Motion.. once the sun goes down or you move indoors, the camera is very quick to fall apart. In well-lit or bright outdoor situations, the Motion’s camera is more than capable of snapping some great shots. Photos are crisp, detailed, full of contrast, and colors are natural. However, once the sun goes down or you move indoors, the camera is very quick to fall apart. Shots become very overexposed, especially in the highlights, colors are washed out, there’s a ton of noise, and the camera constantly hunts for focus in low light that taking a photo can feel like a chore.. Unfortunately, the camera doesn’t offer optical image stabilization which would most likely improve the camera’s sluggish low-light performance.. My favorite aspect of any BlackBerry Android smartphone has to be the software. Not only because the experience is very close to stock Android, but also because BlackBerry’s software add-ons provide a ton of utility without feeling gimmicky.. It all starts with the BlackBerry Hub, an application that makes checking your notifications a simple process. The Blackberry Hub aggregates your emails, social media, text messages, phone calls and more into one place, so youÂ. don’t have to jump back and forth between multiple applications. It’s one of those applications that works so well that it makes you wonder why other OEMs haven’t copied it.. Then there’s the productivity tab, which is another extremely useful tool for checking calendar events, unread messages, your daily tasks, and contact list. The best part is it can be easily accessed at all times with a swipe in from the screen’s edge, regardless of whether you’re within an application or on your home screen.. My favorite aspect of any BlackBerry Android smartphone has to be the software. The BlackBerry experience would not be complete with applications such as BBM and BlackBerry’s best-in-class DTEK security software, that is always monitoring the security status of your device and keeps all of your data encrypted. There are other useful additions that we’ve seen before in prior BlackBerry devices, such as the privacy shade to keep prying eyes from getting a good view of your display, and the elegant swipe up gesture on app icons to access widgets which practically eliminates the need for putting widgets on your home screen.. New to the BlackBerry Motion is the Locker application. This is similar to the secure folder that we’ve seen on Samsung devices as it lets you lock away sensitive or private information that can only be access via your fingerprint, pattern, or passcode.Â. This all sits on top of Android 7.1.2 Nougat at the moment, and, as mentioned, the software is very close to stock. so hopefully the update to Android Oreo isn’t that far away for the Motion.. The biggest downside to the BlackBerry Motion at the time of this writing is its limited availability. It’s only available in a few select markets such as the Middle East where it retails for around $460 and Canada for $599 CAD which converts to $465 USD. There’s no word on if or when the Motion is coming to the U.S. but you should be able to buy it for less than $500. And that would be a fair price taking into account all that the Motion offers.. The BlackBerry Motion is a simple formula. It’s essentially a KEYone but with a bigger battery, water resistance, and an all-touch screen experience instead of a keyboard. For those clamoring for a keyboard-less BlackBerry, the Motion is your answer. Let’s just hope BlackBerry makes it more widely available before it’s too late.. Your source for all things Android!.

Two months ago, we learned that a new, all-screen BlackBerry phone would head our way in October , and on the last day of the month, it finally has. But "our way" has a limited meaning, and in some ways, the phone might not quite be the showstopper we were hoping for.. Called the BlackBerry Motion, it's the first BlackBerry phone to repel water and dust with its IP67 rating. It's also got the largest battery of any BlackBerry at 4,000mAh -- that's expected to last more than a day on a single charge.. For now it seems like the BlackBerry Motion is only headed to Canada, where it will sell online with Koodo, and in some Telus, Bell and SaskTel stores starting Nov. Canadian, which is about $465, £355 or AU$610.. While the BlackBerry Motion has decent-sounding specs, its limited availability means it isn't going to be the BlackBerry that takes the KeyOne and its physical keyboard to the next level around the globe. For a brand that's trying to get back on track after so many years floundering to regain its footing, these phones will have to spread far and wide. All the new phones at CES 2018.

Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

Sony will sell its wireless 'open-ear' buds in the US. BlackBerry Motion arrives with no keyboard and a giant battery. It's a KEYOne for the less traditional crowd.. That didn't take long -- mere days after images emerged , BlackBerry has launched the Motion. As expected, it's effectively a KEYone without the keyboard... and a couple of extra perks. You're still looking at a mid-range device with a Snapdragon 625 chip, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage and a 12-megapixel rear camera, just with a 5.5-inch 1080p display taking up most of the front (there's still a fingerprint reader). However, it's what you can't see that makes the difference. The Motion is IP67 water-resistant, and it packs a whopping 4,000mAh battery. Given the middling processor, this likely translates to a phone that can easily handle a full day off the charger.. The software will still seem familiar. The Motion is running a customized take on Android 7.1 like its predecessor, and you'll get the same security-focused apps intended to make it business- and privacy-friendly.. Don't plan to snap one up right away. The Motion is only shipping to a handful of Middle Eastern markets at first (including Saudi Arabia and the UAE), with a price equivalent to about $460. There's no mention of North American releases so far, although we wouldn't rule them out given the KEYone's availability at Sprint and Canadian carriers.. Even so, the phone may face an uphill battle in North America. The KEYone was considered expensive for the feature set when new, but you could easily point to the keyboard if you had to justify the price. You can't do that with the Motion -- you can mention the battery and what appears to be top-notch build quality, but there are other touch-only phones in this price range (say, the OnePlus 5 ) that offer faster performance and additional tricks. This is really for workers and those BlackBerry fans who remain loyal, but not so loyal that they insist on physical keys.. — BlackBerry Mobile (@BBMobile) October 8, 2017.

more ... more .... more ... more .... by Stephen Schenck. AT&T - AT&T + Verizon - Verizon + Sprint - Sprint + BlackBerry - BlackBerry + Android - Android +. There was time, not too distant in our technological past, when the word “BlackBerry” was practically synonymous with “smartphone” – or, at least, cell-connected PDA. And while nowadays you're more likely to find someone using the words “iPhone” or “Galaxy” in that regard, the BlackBerry name still lives on, continuing to evolve and adapt to a changing mobile landscape. The most recent BlackBerry phones now run Android , albeit with a heavy dose of customization – primarily focused on security and productivity. Earlier this year, we got to know the BlackBerry KEYone , pairing that BB take on Android with some very classic BB hardware, including a physical QWERTY keyboard. Now it's time to check out the KEYone's follow-up, the full-touch BlackBerry Motion. Even with much more traditional-looking smartphone hardware, is there enough of a BlackBerry edge here to help the phone stand out? And can we expect to see some of the elements that made the KEYone so interesting, like its stellar battery life? Let's check it out. In the box: BlackBerry Motion USB Type-C to standard-A cable Fast charger Earbuds (w/ alternate tips) SIM tool Quick-start guide Welcome sheet Warranty sheet Design A smart-looking, metal-bodied handset ushers BlackBerry into the water-resistant-phone club While BlackBerry models like the Priv and more recent KEYone have featured some very unconventional designs, the Motion would find itself much more at home with the rest of the Android pack. The full-touch layout drops any hint of a hardware keyboard, and instead goes with a largely traditional construction. A 5.5-inch screen takes up the majority of the Motion's face – and no fancy curved edges, minimalist bezels, or ultra-wide aspect ratios here. Above that sits the earpiece, selfie cam, and sensors, and below it a pair of capacitive, backlit Android buttons, centered around the physical home button/fingerprint scanner. The left edge is flat and unadorned save for the faint outline of the phone's microSD/SIM tray, while the right edge houses the volume rocker, power button, and programmable convenience key. Below we've got the main speaker grille, USB Type-C port, and an analog headphone jack. While left, right, and bottom edges are all flat metal, the top edge departs from that pattern with an unusual front-to-back curve. It feels more like the side edge of another phone, and at the very least gives you some easy tactile feedback as to which way the Motion's facing when in your pocket. It's all a bit like the anti-KEYone, which featured curved left, right, and bottom edges, but a flat top. The phone's back is mostly covered in a soft-touch patterned material, save for a thin strip of metal up top, housing the main camera and LED flash. There's a subtle texture to it, though not nearly one as pronounced as on the KEYone. It ends up feeling somewhat like an aftermarket skin, though not in at all a bad way. The whole package is comfortably thin, coming in just over 8mm thick. There's also IP67 water resistance this time around, which is a nice bonus we missed when dealing with a mechanical keyboard. Maybe the only weak part of the BlackBerry Motion's design is its home button. The fingerprint scanner within works alright, but the button itself doesn't feel great. On our unit, it didn't feel like the home button was quite parallel with the rest of the phone's face, with the bottom edge sinking in deeper than the button's top edge. It's just a little thing, but with how often you'll be pressing the button, still something you might find yourself frequently thinking about. Display Oversaturated colors aside, BlackBerry gives us a pretty bog-standard smartphone screen The BlackBerry Motion has a fairly nondescript 5.5-inch LCD panel. It's not an unusual shape, nor does it push pixel-density limits with its conservative 1080 x 1920 resolution. Brightness is decent, comparable to phones like the LG V30, but never gets quite as bright as the screen did on the KEYone, which may disappoint some users. Colors really pop on this screen, though we can't say they're particularly accurate, with over-exaggerated, larger-than-life saturation. Some people really dig that look, and if you're among that group, the BB Motion should keep you happy. By default, color temperature's a little on the cool side, though you can dial that up a bit warmer if you so choose in display settings. Interface and Functionality Security continues to be BlackBerry's big software focus, and it generally feels successful Much of BlackBerry's software on the Motion is stuff we've seen before: BBM, the Productivity Tab, DTEK security hub, and a healthy collection of useful shortcuts to common tasks and frequently-checked system settings. The convenience key makes its return here, letting you pull up the app of your choice when pressing this dedicated hardware button. You can even configure it to behave differently based on your environment, accessing specific apps based on whether you're at home, driving, or in a meeting. The only downside here is that while it does support shortcuts to multiple apps at once, it does so via a pop-out on-screen menu, triggered when you press the button. While this works, it sort of defeats the purpose of a special hardware button; we'd have loved to see something like press-and-hold or double-press pull up alternate apps. Other highlights include the screen-obscuring Privacy Shade, darkening the phone's display save for a small, movable window – the idea being that shoulder surfers have less to see. While we like the number of options available, including window size and shape, we can't help but wonder if the feature might backfire by drawing more attention to the phone's screen in the first place. Processor and Memory We're still in mid-range territory, even with an appreciated RAM bump Much like the KEYone, the Motion isn't trying to win any performance awards, and the phone's silicon is decidedly in the mid-range spectrum. That said, today's mid-range can still be hella powerful, while also offering battery savings that more bleeding-edge devices can't touch. Here, the phone runs on a Snapdragon 625 chip paired with 4GB of RAM. That's slightly more memory than the 3GB most of us got with the KEYone, thought we did find the Motion getting slightly lower scores in a number of benchmarks, possibly due to the higher screen resolution here. The 32GB of internal storage isn't huge by any stretch. If you ever do need some room to grow, microSD support has got your back. Connectivity While already available internationally, the big question right now is what we can expect in terms of carrier support for a future US release. So far, we don't have anything official to report, but rumors suggest that quite a few big players could be involved, with AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon all named. Camera Though not particularly impressive, nor does the Motion's camera completely drop the ball We can't imagine that many users go out to buy a BlackBerry phone specifically because they're looking for a handset with a great camera. That said, even if imaging is an afterthought, we'd still rather see it done well enough to snap a decent pic when the moment presents itself, rather than end up with a regrettably out-of-focus, noisy mess. The good news is that even if the BlackBerry Motion is pushing any limits with its camera hardware, it's still respectably equipped, with an f/2.0 12MP main camera, and an f/2.2 8MP front-facer. Image quality Overall, pictures taken with the BlackBerry Motion tend to look OK. They're not the best we've seen, but also far from the worst, and for users not looking for much more than a serviceable point-and-shoot experience, the image quality, camera speed, and feature set here won't let them down. Outdoor daytime pics tend to look the best, while nighttime shots can be seen struggling for available light. Indoor operation falls somewhere between the two, though we didn't run into too many problems. Maybe the weakest point there is that the camera doesn't love focusing up real close in the macro range, limiting the variety of shots you're able to successfully take. Basically: don't ask too much from it, and you'll do just fine. Video recording The Motion offers a good variety of filming modes, extending up to 4K @ 30fps, and with most of them looking pretty decent. Both video and sound quality are acceptable, though we did notice some distracting compression artifacts when filming at 60fps (available at 1080p and lower). There's electronic stabilization (again, at 1080p and below) available that does an alright job, though we've smoother output from other phones. Refocusing while filming can be a bit of a struggle, but for basic shots, the Motion should have you covered. Multimedia Even some middling audio performance doesn't really hurt the Motion's overall picture Despite having this big screen, it doesn't feel like the Motion is putting a priority on its multimedia experience, and that's evident by way of the less-than-impressive speaker. The phone has a single speaker element, mounted on the bottom edge, and while volume levels didn't leave us complaining, they are on the quieter side, and the tinny output is seriously hurting for bass. Even with such limp bass response, the phone's body has a distracting way of vibrating along to your music at volume levels above 75 percent. BlackBerry is among those brands still fighting the good fight for the loyal headphone jack, and the Motion both retains its support for analog headphones and comes with a pair of branded earbuds. There's nothing particularly special about the buds, but we'll give them credit for arriving with a set of alternate-sized tips. Call Quality We've got no complaints with the voice call quality on the BlackBerry Motion; it's not doing anything special there, but nor does it mess up in any way that's going to impact your ability to make and receive calls. We wish the phone were a little less wide, so that it would feel a bit more comfortable when holding it on calls, but that's a very minor complaint. Battery Life Easily the best reason to pick up the Motion, with superior endurance to even the KEYone With the KEYone, we may have initially picked the phone up due to its hardware keyboard, or to check out its unusual form factor, but we kept using it because of its incredible battery life. The combination of a good-sized 3,505mAh battery and low hardware power requirements gave that handset the ability to stretch its operating life north of twelve hours. While the Motion has an even larger 4,000mAh battery, will factors like its bigger screen end up canceling out any potential battery life gains? Not even. Instead, we saw battery life improve even further, now breaking the thirteen-hour barrier. While your particular usage patterns will impact just what kind of gains you can hope to see, this feels very much like a charge-every-other-day-phone. Recharge times with the included adapter aren't bad either, taking right around two hours to fully power back up. Conclusion The Motion isn't so much a big step forward for the BlackBerry line as it is a revamped KEYone , only now without the hardware keyboard. And really, that's not the worst idea for a phone we've ever heard. While some users absolutely loved that keyboard, it was a pretty divisive feature, and if you thought it was ridiculous we'd be trading valuable screen real estate for something that could be implemented perfectly well in software – well, the Motion is just what you've been looking for. The software is just as well-rounded as on the KEYone, and should appeal to users with the same priorities. But some of the same weaknesses are still present, like a camera that's just “alright” when doing a good job, or a speaker that leaves a lot to be desired. But if you're buying the Motion for the right reasons, this package can still deliver, and that's especially true when we're talking about no-holds-barred battery life, easily stretching across days. Perhaps the trickiest consideration to weigh with the Motion – and the KEYone had this same issue – is pricing. While there's some decent stuff here, and we appreciate upgrades like the waterproofing, we're still looking at a price tag that's likely going to be in the low-to-mid-$400 range when the phone lands in the States. And though that sounds like nothing when compared to a $1000 iPhone X , there are a number of other similarly-equipped mid-rangers near that price point. If you really value the BlackBerry software add-ons, and place battery life up on a pedestal, the Motion can still make a lot of sense.

The answer is yes – the brand is alive… and doing reasonably well.. The BlackBerry Motion is a handset for the masses, much more so than the earlier BlackBerry KeyOne. It doesn’t have a keyboard, and at £399 it’s significantly cheaper.. Although a new release, its design appears slightly dated. However, with a battery life that’s significantly better than that of rivals. Honor 9 , Moto X4 or HTC U11 Life , the BlackBerry Motion is easy to recommend to people for whom reliability and practicality are top priorities.. For those who haven’t followed the BlackBerry story over the past few years, the Motion isn’t quite a BlackBerry phone in the same way as, say, a BlackBerry Curve from 2007. In late 2016, Chinese manufacturer TCL signed a licensing/production deal with BlackBerry, as it has done in the past with Alcatel. TCL is also set to revive Palm, for all you underdog lovers out there.. BlackBerry is still reported to have a hand in the design and software of the phones – and the Motion certainly looks and feels like a BlackBerry, even though it doesn’t come with a classic BlackBerry physical keyboard. The company logo sits on on front and back of the device, and the soft-touch plastic of the rear sports a business-like stepped pattern.. The Motion feels fairly dense, and while much of the handset is made of plastic, the sides are aluminium. The curved plate on the back that holds the camera is made to look like brushed aluminium, but it’s plastic.. The use of plastic by phone manufacturers is fine, as long as it isn’t flimsy or made to look like something it’s not. The one durability concern on my particular handset was the presence of a few tiny bubbles in the rear soft-touch finish around the BlackBerry logo, which suggest the coating may start to flake off after a while.. The BlackBerry Motion also lacks the ultra-slim screen surrounds of some of the latest phone designs. However, it’s roughly similar in size to the Sony Xperia XZ Premium. Since the phone has an unusually large battery, a 4000mAh unit, I’m happy to forget slight size complaints.. In most other respects, this is a typical modern Android phone. It has a USB-C charge port, a good fingerprint scanner on the front, and light-up soft keys to each side of the scanner. Storage is 32GB rather than the 64GB you get with the HTC U11 Life (in some territories), but there is a microSD slot in the SIM tray.. The BlackBerry Motion is also water-resistant to IP67. The device can withstand a dunk in water without fear of permanent damage.. The BlackBerry Motion’s screen is similar to that of other phones at this price. It isn’t ultra-high resolution; nor is this an OLED panel. But its quality is good enough to survive a comparison with a phone at any price..

Colours are a little energetic for my taste, but most people appear to prefer this style over a more relaxed one – particularly judging by the reception of the Google Pixel 2 XL. People complained about the Pixel 2’s more muted display.. BlackBerry doesn’t offer much control over the Motion display’s look. However, there is a colour temperature slider in Settings with which you can adjust the screen for a more warm or cool look. And, as usual with a solid LCD, the only time you’re likely to really notice a signifiant shortfall in performance is in a dark room watching a movie.. Blacks won’t appear perfect, but they’re not too far off. Viewed from an extreme vertical angle, you’ll notice quite a bit of colour shift too – but this isn’t really a major issue in what is a mid-range phone.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

The smartphone maker also promises two more new BlackBerry-branded phones in 2018 (and says its has the Spectre and Meltdown security flaws under control).. PCMag reviews products independently , but we may earn affiliate commissions from buying links on this page. LAS VEGAS—Security is at the core of BlackBerry's brand, so it's reassuring to hear that the company says it has the recent, globe-girdling Spectre and Meltdown security flaws under control. We met with BlackBerry here at CES and discussed security, its new BlackBerry Motion phone, and future products.. Spectre and Meltdown are industry-wide problems affecting almost all smartphones, PCs, and servers. BlackBerry Mobile's global portfolio head, Gareth Hurn, said Spectre will be dealt with in a January security release for BlackBerry KeyOne and Motion devices, and that Meltdown does not affect the company's phones.. "We are completely committed to updating our product with the latest security patches from Google, and this is done on a monthly basis," said Alain Lejeune, global GM for BlackBerry Mobile.. Security is one of the pillars of the BlackBerry brand, and it's a key selling point as TCL (the owners of Alcatel) rebuilds the BlackBerry name on store shelves. The first TCL-run BlackBerry branded phone, the KeyOne , rolled out slowly in the US over the last half of this year, a strategy the BlackBerry executives said meant the phone made a smaller public splash than it could have otherwise. Sales are ramping up now, though.. "The US go-to-market has been phased over the whole of '17, which means we probably lacked impact at the start," said Francois Mahieu, BlackBerry's GM for global sales. "The pattern we're seeing with [US] carriers is very interesting … We have enterprise customers saying, 'I'd like to do a proof of concept with your phone' … customers buy just enough units to test, and then the same company [starts] ordering by batches of 20 and 50.". That leaves the KeyOne with some legs in the market, as it's operating on the slower calendar of enterprise rollouts rather than the faster calendar of consumer launches. BlackBerry is promising "two new BlackBerry smartphones" later this year, but it isn't saying whether one of them will be a KeyOne replacement.. Right now, it's refreshing the line a little bit with a bronze-colored, dual-SIM KeyOne for global markets; the launch of the $449 unlocked, full-touch BlackBerry Motion in the US; and some new privacy software which will roll out to both the KeyOne and the Motion.. The Motion is a slab-style smartphone, with a 5.5-inch touch screen. Mahieu acknowledged that full-touch BlackBerry smartphones have been a lot more popular in countries outside the US, such as the Middle East and Canada, so that's where the company focused its launches first. But it made a good pitch for its differentiating features for small business people.. In the hand, the Motion feels rock solid. It has a textured back and is ribbed around the edge with metal, and it has a "nano-diamond, anti-scratch" 5.5-inch screen. It's not the slimmest, lightest phone—rather, it feels like it can take a beating or a dunking. BlackBerry says battery life is the Motion's major selling point. It can go for two days of real use without a charge on its 4,000mAh battery, the execs said.. Some of that battery sipping, of course, comes because of the $449 unlocked phone's midrange specs. It's running a Snapdragon 625 processor, like the KeyOne, along with a 1080p LCD screen, and 12MP main and 8MP front cameras. There's 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, along with a MicroSD card slot.. It's running Android 7.1.1 (an Oreo update is coming, but as we said before, at least it's getting security updates) with a heavy load of custom BlackBerry applications. You shouldn't complain—you're here for the custom apps, especially BlackBerry Hub, which integrates various forms of messaging into a unified inbox.. The Motion also comes with some interesting privacy-related software. It's all stuff that could have third-party alternatives, but it's good to see it preloaded. An on-device "locker" lets you hide files and photos you don't want uploaded to the cloud. A "privacy shade" app lets you read the screen a line at a time to hide sensitive information from onlookers. There's a password manager built in now, too. These apps will also roll out to the KeyOne in an update, the execs said.. The Motion is only compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile, for now, and its LTE band complement is conservative; it has a good selection of AT&T, T-Mobile, and roaming bands, but not T-Mobile's new Band 71. The phone will probably work on Verizon's LTE network if you put a Verizon SIM in, but Mahieu said he wasn't making any guarantees on that.. "We hope to bring more products onto the Verizon network in 2018," Lejeune said.. Honor's View 10 Is the New Flagship Killer. Honor's View 10 Is the New Flagship Killer. The new BlackBerry Mobile, under TCL's umbrella, has only been around for 10 months, the execs pointed out. As part of a relatively successful business—TCL is a big TV maker, and Alcatel chugs along as the No. 5 US smartphone maker—BlackBerry can afford to be cautious about the US market, Mahieu said.. "Realistically, we'll take a little bit of time to make sure we listen to the market requirements carefully," he said. "This we're doing with Motion, is something we're learning a great deal from. The door is open to much more in the future.". Check Out the Best Photos From CES 2018. Nvidia GeForce Now Finally Available for Windows PCs. Nvidia GeForce Now Finally Available for Windows PCs.

Useful BlackBerry software on top of Android 7.1. Google Pixel Buds review: Overpromised, underdelivered Ring Video Doorbell 2 review: A fun IoT device to boost your security AT&T ZTE Axon M review: A unique dual screen phone optimized for multi-tasking Google Pixel 2 review: No frills, but a great camera and fast Android updates Apple iPhone X review: This is as good as it gets. The BlackBerry Motion is the second handset to come from BlackBerry Mobile: TCL Communication now licences the BlackBerry brand for smartphones (TCL also makes Alcatel handsets and some under its own name too). The first smartphone from this deal, the BlackBerry KEYone , came with a physical keyboard, whereas the Motion is a more standard touchscreen-only device. Like the KEYone, the Motion runs Android, and also features a number of touches that may endear it to business users. The BlackBerry Motion is a solid-looking and feeling handset with an aluminium frame and a textured back that provides a solid grip. The curved edges at the bottom of the handset make it comfortable to hold, while the rounded top slips easily into your pocket, although at 8.1mm it's one of the thicker smartphones on the market. At 167g it's a decent weight considering the 5.5-inch screen size; it also has an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance (which is pretty standard now).. The 5.5-inch BlackBerry Motion measures 155.8mm by 75.5mm by 8.1mm and weighs 167g. It's powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 625 chipset with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.. The 16:9 aspect ratio display offers FHD resolution (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) for a moderate 403ppi pixel density. Image quality is bright and clear, although the bezels above and below the display are rather large, giving it a moderate screen-to-body ratio of 70.8 percent (minimal-bezel designs have ratios above 80%). The 5.5-inch screen puts it in the same size category as the iPhone 8 Plus , Huawei P10 Plus and Moto Z2 Force .. The bottom bezel houses the physical home key, which also incorporates the fingerprint sensor. I'm not a huge fan of physical home keys, although it can be used to scroll up and down through alerts and settings. The embedded fingerprint recognition worked, but not as flawlessly as others I've tried, and it would sometimes take a couple of attempts to get it to recognise my digits.. The convenience button mid-way down the left side can be set up to display three on-screen app shortuts when pressed.. I first viewed the convenience button as an irritation, but it quickly grew into a favourite. It sits half-way up the left side of the Motion, beneath the power button. This meant I regularly got mixed up between the two during my testing -- hence the initial irritation. But it does have its charms too. The button can be programmed to display three on-screen app shortcuts, allowing you to jump straight to your most used services quickly. I found this to be surprisingly handy (when I managed to hit the right button, that is).. The BlackBerry Motion packs a 2GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 chipset with a 650MHz Adreno 506 GPU and 4GB of RAM -- the same platform as the KEYone. From a general performance point of view these keep the handset motoring adequately with no obvious lags, although this mid-range SoC's performance lags behind that of cutting-edge smartphones with more powerful chipsets.. During testing the BlackBerry Motion delivered over 2 days' battery life with moderate usage.. There's only 32GB of internal storage on the BlackBerry Motion, whereas its KEYone stablemate also has a 64GB option. This is a moderate storage complement in today's smartphone market, but at least you can add to it via the handset's microSD card slot.. The BlackBerry Motion packs a huge 4,000mAh battery, one of the biggest available, which makes battery life one of this handset's standout features. It just keeps going and going -- BlackBerry claims '32+' hours. It's a bigger battery than the KEYone (3,505mAh) and also supports Quick Charge 3.0, which promises to give you 50 percent charge in 41 minutes. During testing I've been getting two-day battery life, and sometimes longer, with moderate usage, which is very impressive.. Another neat touch is that when the phone is locked and charging a bar will climb up the right side of the screen showing how charging is going: a short red line lengthens and turns green as the battery fills up.. The 12-megapixel main (rear) camera comes with a couple of handy business-focused features. For example the 'scanner' mode allows you to take a photo of a business card and use optical character recognition to turn that information automatically into a contact, which is a nice touch.. Locker mode allows you to snap photos with an extra layer of security. Photos can only be taken by putting a fingerprint sensor and these images can then only be viewed by putting a fingerprint back on the sensor. According to BlackBerry this allows you to "hide your photos of weekend escapades or private selfies from people that may look at your phone." Equally, it could be used to add a little more security to business information.. The test shots I took with the rear camera were good -- solid, if unremarkable. While this is fine for a business phone where the camera is rarely used, for those people who want to use the same device for home and work this may be something of a sticking point. Cameras are a key consideration for consumers and premium handsets will offer richer features such as dual-sensor setups on high-end Apple, Huawei, LG and Samsung devices. If you're after advanced features like bokeh , the BlackBerry Motion's camera may be rather limiting.. These days, BlackBerry handsets run on Android rather than BB10, and in the case of the Motion that's Android 7.1 Nougat. This means it comes equipped with the standard set of Google apps like Gmail and Google Maps. But it also packs a number of preloaded BlackBerry apps and features, which may go down well with business users.. Among these is the BlackBerry Hub , which allows you to consolidate email, social media and other notifications into one feed so that you can check all your messages in one go. This is a handy timesaver and has the added advantage of helping to wean you off social media as you don't need to open those apps to see if you've been mentioned.. Related to this is the Productivity Tab, which you can access by swiping from the right of the screen. This gives you instant access to calendar, messages, tasks and contacts; I found it very useful for a quick refresher on which meeting I was heading to next, for example, without having to open any apps.. BlackBerry's DTEK app gives you a somewhat superficial overview of the handset's security status.. The handset also comes with the DTEK app, which aims to give you an overall view of the current security and privacy level on the phone ('excellent', 'fair' or 'poor') and what you can do to improve it. Much of what it measures is basic good security practice, such as whether you have set a screen lock, or whether you have decided to download apps from beyond Google Play. More granularity would have been welcomed here.. Some of these check boxes are rather banal: you'll get a tick for device hardware from the app for simply having a BlackBerry device, and for running Android. However, it's a reasonable snapshot of basic security. DTEK can also track if apps are taking pictures or videos without your knowledge or behaving in other suspicious ways, such as turning on the microphone or sending a text message.. The Privacy Shade is another nice feature for the security conscious. If you want to check something on your phone without displaying everything else on the screen too, the Privacy Shade effectively creates a letterbox through which you can view one part of the screen while the rest remains in darkness. The box can be moved around and can change shape.. The BlackBerry Motion is a solid mid-range Android handset with some handy features aimed at business users -- at a time when handsets are explicitly targeting that market.. Bolting some of BlackBerry's best ideas around productivity and security onto the familiar Android operating system should give the touchscreen-only Motion all-round appeal, although the camera subsystem (12MP rear, 8MP front) is no better than average. However, that giant 4,000mAh battery should make it easier for mobile professionals to remain productive on the move.. Kick off your day with ZDNet's daily email newsletter.

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. BlackBerry Motion review: It's all about the battery life. Too bad an inconsistent camera holds back an otherwise-solid phone.. Back in the old days, when BlackBerry was the premier smartphone maker, you could count on its devices to feature two things: a physical keyboard and long battery life. Things have changed a lot since then, but part of that legacy lives on in the BlackBerry Motion. It might lack that classic keyboard, but it makes up for that with one of the biggest smartphone batteries I've used all year. That should keep some hardcore devotees happy, right? We're not exactly sure when (or even if) the Motion will land in the US, but that's just as well: It's a fine phone but overpriced for what it is.. The second smartphone developed by BlackBerry Mobile is an all-touch affair, and it manages to get more right than wrong. The combination of a mid-range chipset, a 5.5-inch 1080p screen and an enormous battery mean the new BlackBerry Motion routinely runs for two days on a single charge. We also appreciated the handful of valuable software features layered on top of Android, something we can't say of every phone maker. Unfortunately, the camera's performance left a lot to be desired, and there are more powerful devices available in the same price range. Ultimately, it's a good phone, but not a very good deal.. Unlike the last two all-touch BlackBerrys, the Motion is more than just a clone of an existing device. In fact, I'd argue the Motion is the best touchscreen BlackBerry in years. It's conservative in that way BlackBerrys always are, but the Motion's body is a handsome blend of glass, aluminum and soft-touch plastic that's made to look like carbon fiber. In an effort to give the Motion some extra character, BlackBerry Mobile rounded the phone's top edge while leaving the bottom one flat. It's a neat touch, but it's hard to appreciate unless you look closely. Still, the fact that BlackBerry Mobile is trying to give a glass-and-metal slab any personality at all is a reassuring change of pace.. The phone looks better than it feels, though. It's quite a bit taller than the BlackBerry KEYone so folks with smaller hands will have to do the smartphone shimmy to reach the top of the screen. The Motion's flat sides, meanwhile, make it feel boxy and utilitarian. Then again, if there's any phone that can get away with feeling utilitarian, it's a BlackBerry. More importantly, the Motion is rated IP67 for water and dust protection. Try pulling that off on a phone with a physical keyboard.. Gallery: BlackBerry Motion review | 22 Photos. When I reviewed the BlackBerry KEYone earlier this year, I said it was a little strange to be testing a phone with such a cramped screen after being spoiled by devices like the Galaxy S8 and LG G6. Even with a longer, more conventional display, though, the Motion still feels a little dated compared to other recent phones. It doesn't help that there's lots of space beneath the 5.5-inch screen; that's where the capacitive navigation keys go, along with the physical home button. There's a fingerprint sensor stuck in there, too, and while it worked quickly most of the time, it routinely faltered when my thumb was even slightly sweaty.. Honestly, there isn't a whole lot to say about the Motion's 5.5-inch LCD screen. It runs at 1080p, as you'd expect from a phone in this price range, and it's generally nice looking. Colors are pleasant, if not exactly exciting, and the viewing angles are quite good; you'd have to look from a pretty extreme angle to see the colors distort. The Motion's screen lacks the punchy hues and deep blacks you'd get from an AMOLED panel (like, say, the one on the DTEK60), but I'm not sure anyone expected otherwise. All told, it's a perfectly serviceable display and nothing more. For a brand whose core mission is to fuel productivity, though, that's not necessarily a dealbreaker.. Same goes for the Motion's sound quality: It's purely adequate. The single, downward-firing speaker produces loud, slightly lifeless audio; there's a notable lack of oomph evident when listening to music, partly because there's very little bass to speak of. Setups like this are all too common in mid-range phones, but they're still just fine for plowing through podcasts or taking in a few YouTube videos. Kudos to BlackBerry Mobile for including a headphone jack, though.. You'll find the USB-C port next to the headphone jack along the phone's bottom, while the volume rocker, sleep/wake button and convenience key are located on the right side. Good luck keeping those last two buttons straight, by the way -- the latter is ribbed so you can identify it without looking, but it's right where you'd expect the phone's power button to sit. I've been testing this phone for close to two weeks now, and I still find myself reaching for the wrong button when I want to turn the device on. Here's hoping your muscle memory adapts faster than mine does.. Despite some charming new design flourishes, the stuff inside is basically the same as what you'll find in the KEYone. BlackBerry Mobile once again opted to use a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 chipset with an Adreno 506 GPU and a relatively paltry 32GB of storage. (Thankfully, you can slip a microSD card onto the SIM tray and go nuts with the movies and photos.) The Motion packs 4GB of RAM compared to the KEYone's 3GB, but the biggest deviation from the KEYone formula is the Motion's massive, 4,000mAh battery. That's one of the largest we've tested this year, and it's a clear callback to the days when BlackBerrys were the kings of smartphone battery life.. The Motion runs Android 7.1.2 out of the box and, as usual for BlackBerry, what looks like a stock Android interface actually hides quite a bit of depth. The KEYone and Motion share plenty of features so I'll try not to repeat earlier Engadget coverage too much, but man, there is a lot going on here.. As usual, your emails and social communiques get routed into a unified inbox called the Hub, making it easy to quickly glance at all your incoming messages. Actually dealing with all of those items can still be tricky, though; there's still no way to mark all of them as read in one fell swoop, but you can create different "views" that only show notifications from certain apps and accounts. The productivity tab, meanwhile, seems more immediately useful. Tapping on the right edge of the screen offers up quick glances at upcoming calendar events, unread messages in the Hub, tasks you've added to your checklist and your favorite contacts. Normally, I'd have widgets splayed across my home screens to offer the same information, but the productivity tab has the added benefit of being usable while you're already in another app.. The other usual flourishes are here too, like shortcuts for common actions in the app launcher and the ability to swipe up on app icons to see their related widgets. There are a few interface tweaks specific to this device, though: You can swipe your finger down the home button to pull down the notifications shade, and more importantly, you can assign up to three actions to the so-called "smart" convenience key. If you only have one action tied to the key -- say, firing up Google Maps -- tapping the button does just that. With multiple actions attached to the convenience key, though, you'll have to tap on the screen to make your selection. It's not nearly as elegant as the KEYone's approach, but then again, how could it be? You could map actions to just about every button on its physical keyboard -- that's 27 convenience keys to work with instead of just one.. Beyond the interface, BlackBerry Mobile also spent more time thinking about how to keep your important data under wraps. The result: a new feature called Locker mode that allows you to securely store your most sensitive files. Moving things into the locker is easy enough: Just select some items in the Files app and hit "Lock." Once done, you'll be prompted to authenticate every time you want to see your secrets. It's not as technically elegant as, say Samsung's Secure Folder -- which allows users to install a separate, private instance of an app that requires authentication to access -- but it's a step in the right direction.. More interesting is how you can snap a photo with the camera using the fingerprint sensor instead of tapping the on-screen shutter button, a move that sends the resulting shot straight into the locker. If some of your data is so important that it needs to be shielded from prying eyes, there's always the included privacy shade app. It obscures all of the screen except for a slim bar you can drag up and down. My life isn't nearly interesting enough to require this, but it's a nice touch for paranoiacs and people with codeword clearance.. And then there's our old friend DTEK, an app that rates how secure the Motion is at any given time. I imagine most business-oriented users will stay firmly in the "Excellent" category, but tinkerers and power users who install apps from outside the Play Store will definitely see their ratings docked. (Not that that matters to anyone who isn't beholden to an IT department.) DTEK hasn't changed much since it debuted on the BlackBerry Priv two years ago, but it's still a handy tool for managing app permissions and at least tries to make it easy for people to understand the importance of mobile device security.. BlackBerrys have never excelled at photography, and nothing about the Motion's 12-megapixel main camera changes that. At its best, when scenes are awash in light, the Motion is capable of capturing some pleasantly solid photos. Colors are mostly accurate if a little washed-out and there's a respectable level of detail to be found if you look closely enough.. Unfortunately, anything less than optimal conditions seem to stymie the Motion's camera. Let's say people are walking back and forth through your frame -- the Motion's camera often struggles to expose photos correctly in scenarios like those. The KEYone had similar problems and I was hoping BlackBerry Mobile would get around to fixing them by the time it released its second phone. Gallery: BlackBerry Motion camera samples | 22 Photos. And even now I'm a little confused by the fact that an option to "focus before capture" is disabled by default. The feature might add a moment of hesitation before actually snapping the photo, but the results almost always look better. It's like BlackBerry was more concerned with maintaining the perception of speed than actually producing better pictures from the outset.. Just to reiterate, the camera is actually pretty good sometimes. What's frustrating is that it can be difficult to tell when you're actually going to get a pretty photo. More than anything, this camera needs to be more reliable. I will say, however, that the camera is pretty consistently bad in low light. Colors begin to look more lifeless as ambient light grows scarcer. Focusing -- which can be dicey to start with -- becomes more sluggish. Some will argue that BlackBerrys are business focused, and that as a result, the company doesn't need to care about camera quality as much as its rivals do. Those people have a point, but don't forget: BlackBerry Mobile went to the trouble of including a camera mode that scans business cards and adds them to your contact list. Helpful? Sure, but I would've preferred a little less effort on that and more time spent improving the overall camera performance. Thankfully, the 8-megapixel front-facing camera was tougher to criticize: It churned out decent selfies without issue, and I can't ask for much more than that..

BlackBerry was never really interested in fighting spec wars with the rest of the industry. Indeed, the Motion isn't some flagship beast meant to get power users rallying under the BlackBerry banner. With its Snapdragon 625 chipset and 4GB of RAM, the Motion is decidedly mid-range, but that doesn't mean it left me lacking. There was more than enough horsepower here for me to flit between Slack, Spotify, Gmail and Trello with ease. All told, I noticed very few hiccups during my daily routine. Productivity is a BlackBerry priority, and for what most people probably have to accomplish in a given day, the Motion seems like more than enough.. It shouldn't surprise you to hear the Motion isn't terribly well-suited to gaming, but it's not awful at it either. I ran into some lag while taking a pirate's ship out into the open seas in Tempest , but the game never felt unplayable. Ditto for graphically intense games like Modern Combat 5 and Asphalt: The Motion dropped some frames and stuttered now and again, but it held up better than you might expect.. More importantly, it's clear the Motion was designed with longevity in mind. Qualcomm's power-sipping chipset and 1080p display pair nicely with the enormous 4,000mAh battery wedged inside and, as a result, the Motion routinely lasted two full days before needing to be recharged. To be clear, that's two full days of me checking my email like a maniac, furiously Google searching and binging on YouTube videos. Over quiet weekends, I could stretch the Motion's battery life to nearly two and a half days before plugging it in. There were times when it seemed possible I could get it to hang in for almost three days, a prospect that made me giddier than I care to admit. While I'm far from sold on some of the Motion's attributes, I'm seriously considering bringing it to CES with me next month just to make sure I have a phone that won't go dark in the middle of a press conference.. No US carrier has committed to carrying the BlackBerry Motion, and for all we know, it may never be sold unlocked here. It's available in Canada for $600CAD (about $470 in US dollars) and there's a real chance that the only way you'll be to get one is from an online retailer in another country. While I know that's no big deal for some BlackBerry die-hards, it's worth taking a deep breath and exploring other options, too. After all, the Motion has a clear edge when it comes to security, but there are far more stylish, powerful options out there for about the same price.. It was built to replace a phone that is itself only a few months old, and it offers flagship performance and an extra-long AMOLED screen for $499. That tidy sum also nets you one of Qualcomm's top-tier Snapdragon 835 chipsets, 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, all of which help the 5T outclass the Motion in pure power. You'll have to make do with a smaller battery, though, and recent concerns about security flaws may mean OnePlus is a non-starter for some BlackBerry fans.. In that case, there are also devices like the $499 Essential PH-1. It might not have the best camera I've tested this year, but it is easily one of the most impeccably crafted smartphones I've ever used -- no surprise considering founder Andy Rubin embraced Apple's approach to premium designs. The Essential uses the same Snapdragon 835 chipset as the OnePlus 5T, but it comes with a generous 128GB of storage and features one of the cleanest Android builds you'll find out there. And who could forget its design? The PH-1 has virtually no bezel surrounding its screen, making it a compact delight that fits comfortably in most hands. Now, do most people's daily routines require as much power as either of these phones offer? Probably not, but they illustrate just how much you can get for $500 these days.. The BlackBerry Motion is a strong follow-up to a phone I liked more than I expected to, and in general, it gets more right than wrong. More importantly, I get the impression that the folks at BlackBerry Mobile/TCL are focusing on the things that really matter to its core fans. With all that said, it's hard to recommend the BlackBerry Motion to anyone who hasn't already pledged allegiance to the brand. It's just such a niche device, and what you get for the money doesn't quite feel like enough considering how strong the competition is. Unless you're absolutely obsessed with security or want to pay to keep your beloved phone brand alive, the BlackBerry Motion is ultimately a good phone that doubles as a bad deal.. blackberry , gear , mobile , review.

The BlackBerry Motion is the future of Android phones. The BlackBerry Motion is a solid Android phone with a price that's a bit too high to stomach.. For better or worse, the BlackBerry Motion is the future of Android. Neither flashy nor charming, the Motion is plain and utilitarian. It's a purpose-built device for a small slice of the smartphone buying public, one that values qualities that don't stand out. At $450 unlocked, the Motion is arguably overpriced for what it is, but BlackBerry has never had trouble getting its admittedly small core audience to pay a premium.. That BlackBerry Tax, if I may be so bold, bundles a certain amount of confidence in the post-purchase experience, both from a security and reliability perspective. The Motion is pretty rugged, and aside from my Pixels has the most current security patch of any phone in my office. It's also a decent performer, has insanely good battery life, and an excellent software experience. Here's why I think you shouldn't overlook it now that it's available unlocked in the U.S.. BlackBerry is great at software ... The future of Android is a battery that doesn't quit. Most people don't necessarily leave their phones unplugged overnight, but the Motion can and does last well into the following day without a nighttime top-up. The 4,000mah battery is enormous, but it doesn't make the phone itself oversized — it's just big enough to tip over into phablet territory.. The phone is also powerful enough not to make you feel bad about using a phone with such a big battery because you're not sacrificing one for the other. Like the BlackBerry KEYone , the Motion just flies through everything — except between then and now, BlackBerry must have fixed whatever was causing the stuttering and slow app launching that plagued the KEYone when it debuted last year.. With the Motion, you're not buying a Pixel or even a OnePlus phone; you're buying a BlackBerry. While we don't know the company's long-term record when it comes to platform and security updates — remember, the Priv doesn't count because it was sold prior to the formation of BlackBerry Mobile — we have a decent amount of data to work with. The KEYone has managed to maintain near-monthly software updates on carriers and in the unlocked market alike, and Motion is likely to receive the same attention.. The reason is simple: BlackBerry built security updates into the design of the phone; the company committed to releasing monthly security updates to carriers, so the unlocked models benefit from that work already being done.. On the software side itself, BlackBerry's take on Android is subtle and easy to understand, but steeped in the productivity legacy that, over the years, many people (including me) have come to appreciate. I'm not going to say that the Motion's software is as smooth as the Pixel 2 nor as feature-rich as the Galaxy Note 8, but like so much else with the phone it falls somewhere in the middle.. I'm a big fan of Google's official Android keyboard, Gboard, but whenever I pick up the Motion I'm always struck by how fast I can type on BlackBerry's on-screen equivalent. Obviously, the Motion lacks the hardware keys that make the KEYone so enticing, so the alternative needs to be just as good, and for the most part, it delivers.. Even as Gboard's prediction engine has improved over the years, there's something nice about being able to flick up on a particular letter to complete a word that makes BlackBerry's on-screen keyboard so satisfying to use, especially for longer-form work like documents and emails. That you still can't download it on non-BlackBerry devices is an indication that the company knows what it has and wants to keep it for itself. The Motion is the first BlackBerry with an IP67 ingress rating, which means it can withstand up to one meter of water for 30 minutes. That's not uncommon these days — most decent phones above $500 have some sort of ingress protection — but in this price range, it's still rare.. Moreover, the phone is pretty rugged; I've been knocking it around in my pocket or bag going on two months now (yes, this write-up is a long time coming) and it looks no worse for the wear. It may not feel as hefty as the KEYone — there's more plastic than metal in here, largely to keep the price down — but it's a substantial device that will sustain some abuse.. Why you wouldn't want the BlackBerry Motion. See, a lot of people dismissed the Priv when it debuted in 2015, but it became a veritable critical darling (if not a financial success). Same with the KEYone, except there's evidence to suggest that the phone is singlehandedly carrying TCL into 2018. Demand is so good there's even a bronze one now.. And yes, the Motion lacks BlackBerry's signature differentiator, the hardware keyboard, but it's a fundamentally solid product backed up by a company (well, two companies) that isn't going anywhere. At $450, it's not cheap, I'd wager there are a fair number of people willing to spend that extra hundred or so for the BlackBerry name. And if not, wait a few months: the phone will invariably get discounted to $350 before the summer (just a prediction, but one with precedent).. It's not all lollipops and rainbows over here for the BlackBerry Motion. See above — at $450, it's not cheap. While there's a subset of BlackBerry loyalists willing to spend that on a mid-range phone, most others — especially others buying their own phones and not having one foist upon them from a corporate overlord — would like see slicker, cheaper alternatives and balk at the Motion's asking price.. The Motion does a lot more right than wrong, but some people may not be able to get over its price — or its bad camera.. Especially so if imaging is a concern. The Motion has a 12MP camera, but that's just a number on paper; this thing is nowhere near as good as its equal-resolution peer in the KEYone. Indeed, I found it difficult to take a photo with the Motion that I'd be willing to share anywhere.. And finally, if you're interested in using this unlocked phone on Sprint, Verizon, or any other CDMA network, you're out of luck — this is a GSM-only device. Not a huge deal, but it pretty much halves the potential U.S. It's not hard to grasp: Android is maturing, and so are the phones that run it. While people still clamor for the $1000 flagships, the real growth is in the affordable space, and the diversity of choice allows anyone to find the phone that is right for him or her. The BlackBerry Motion isn't the best mid-range phone on the market — not by a longshot — but it's got enough appeal to enough people to peacefully co-exist with products from Honor and Motorola and others.. My take is this: I highly recommend the BlackBerry Motion unless imaging is a priority. It has a camera, but it's not good. Its other flaws are more forgiveable..

Lack of application but I love BlackBerry from my heart,wish I change my current BlackBerry to a new BlackBerry motion. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of PhoneDog.com.

http:/ / www.phonescoop.com/ articles/ article.php? a=19936. The latest collaboration between BlackBerry Mobile and TCL is the Motion, a large slab that runs Android and boasts BlackBerry's powerful productivity tools. Mobile pros will be happy with features such as BlackBerry Hub and the Productivity Tab, while businesses that deploy the Motion will appreciate the DTEK security software. Despite its many strengths, however, the Motion is a little uneven. Here is Phone Scoop's in-depth review of the BlackBerry Motion.. The BlackBerry Motion is an all-screen Android smartphone with BlackBerry's business-focused messaging software on board. If you're looking for a secure handset with killery battery life and productivity-minded software, the BlackBerry Motion is a fine option for today's mobile pros.. The Motion, manufactured by TCL, is a large slab. It's made from a variety of materials, including glass, aluminum, carbon fiber, and some plastic. The design is a little chaotic with black, gray, and chrome patched together here and there. It's a BlackBerry, so it leans toward the conservative, and yet the Motion is still modern in its own way.. A U-shaped aluminum frame runs from the top left corner down around the bottom and back up the right side. I like the brushed look of the metal and the chamfered edges on both the front and back sides. The side edges are flat, which means they aren't the most comfortable against your palm. Unusually, the phone has relatively sharp corners at the top and rounded corners at the bottom. The Motion looks and feels serious.. The Motion is a Very Big Phone. The Motion is larger than the Pixel 2 XL; the only handset on my desk that's bigger is the Galaxy Note8. The size, combined with the flat side edges and blocky shape, make the Motion one of the least comfortable devices I've used in recent memory. If you have small hands you'll find this phone a chore to use effectively. It fits into pockets, though just barely. The Motion feels like a block of metal in your pocket and it will stab your leg from time to time.. TCL did a fine job assembling the device. The metal frame is solid, the glass is polished finely, and the carbon fiber rear panel has a pleasing soft-touch finish. These components are all fitted together tightly. I have absolutely no complaints about the build quality. Importantly, the Motion is rated IP67 for protection against water and dust. This means it can sit in three feet of water for up to 30 minutes and live to tell the tale. This is a rare feature for a BlackBerry.. I like the uniformity of the black glass panel as it stretches from side to side and top to bottom. The glass is curved just a bit where it meets the frame. I'm not a fan of the bezels; the chin and forehead are both extra thick. You can't miss the earpiece grille above the display, nor the BlackBerry button below it. This hardware button acts as a home key and fingerprint reader. It is slightly concave, which helps your thumb find it without looking. The back and app-switcher touch keys work as they should.. The card tray is on the left side and supports a nano SIM and a microSD memory card. It's a nice metal tray and I had no trouble with it.. All of the buttons are on the right edge. The BlackBerry "convenience key" has a ribbed texture to set it apart from the other controls. You can assign this shortcut button to perform a range of actions. Travel and feedback are very good. The power button / screen lock key is next. It's about the same size as the convenience key, but has a smooth texture. I liked travel and feedback, though I did often tap the convenience key thinking it was the screen lock button. The volume toggle is closest to the top and it is a long, slim affair. The Motion includes a USB-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Surely some will be happy about the headphone jack. The top edge is a rounded piece of plastic and it doesn't house any functional controls.. It's nice to see BlackBerry bring back the carbon fiber. I've always liked it as an option for phones and it looks great as the rear panel of the Motion. The carbon fiber is mostly flat and has a minimal curve right along the metal frame. The BlackBerry logo is emblazoned on the rear in chrome; you can't miss it.. The one aspect of the Motion's design that bugs me is the plastic cap at the top of the rear. A piece of plastic wraps from the edge of carbon fiber up and over the top of the phone where it meets the glass on front. The plastic cap holds the large, round camera module and dual LED flash. The material has the look of brushed metal but it is obviously plastic. I understand the engineering decision behind this design choice and yet I think BlackBerry could have done better.. You cannot remove the phone's rear panel; the battery is inaccessible.. The BlackBerry Motion is a significant piece of hardware. It's big, heavy, and industrial-looking, almost to a fault. However, it's well-made and pretty much your only option if you want an all-screen BlackBerry.. BlackBerry selected a 5.5-inch, full HD screen. The LCD screen makes use of the more traditional 16:9 aspect ratio, so it's the same shape as many other screens on mid-range phones right now.. The pixel count and size work together well enough. Pixel density is good at 401ppi. Text and icons look nice and sharp on the display. The screen does put out plenty of light. I had no trouble reading the phone outdoors with the brightness cranked up, though you'll notice the automatic brightness control is slow to react to huge swings in ambient light. Viewing angles are good; the screen doesn't change colors when tilted from side to side, though it does lose brightness. It's a fine screen for this class of phone.. I was able to use the phone outdoors in chilly weather when wearing a pair of thin leather gloves. There's also a night mode (called Night Light) that reduces blue light in order to reduce eye strain, and you can adjust the overall color temperature.. The Motion is being sold as an unlocked international phone right now. It includes a decent selection of LTE bands for North America and overseas (1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 7 / 8 / 12 / 13 / 17 / 20 / 28 / 29 / 30 / 38 / 40 / 41 / 66), including the main bands used by AT&T and T-Mobile in the U.S. It's nice to see T-Mobile's band 66 on board, as well as AT&T's 29 and 30. I tested the phone on AT&T's network in and around New York City and would rate the Motion's performance as par with other unlocked phones.. The phone connected to AT&T's network with no issue. It landed on 4G data most of the time, though it occasionally dropped to 3.5G in weak signal areas. Download speeds peaked around 25Mbps and uploads reached 10Mbps. Streaming media (Spotify, YouTube) via LTE was acceptable with only minor amounts of stopping and buffering. Normal activities such as checking email and social networks never gave the Motion's LTE radio any trouble.. The Motion's ability to connect calls is not in question. The phone didn't give me any trouble patching through on the first dial. Moreover, it didn't drop any calls, even at highway speeds, nor did it miss any.. The Motion is a fine voice phone. The earpiece pushes clear voices with plenty of volume. I was able to enjoy conversations at home and even in the car with the volume set to medium levels. I had to turn it up when walking on city streets or sitting in a busy coffee shop. High volumes introduced a small amount of distortion, but it wasn't too bad. People I spoke to through the Motion said I sounded "near by.". It offers clear, pleasing voice tones at medium volumes that are audible in spaces such as your home or office. Cranking it up does impact quality a bit (some distortion), but you can easily hear calls in a moving vehicle.. Ringers and alert tones got my attention the majority of the time. The vibrate alert did its job well enough.. One place the Motion impresses is battery life. TCL packed a large 4,000mAh battery into the handset, and it delivers. I consistently found the battery lasted through two full days of productivity. In fact, I found it difficult to drain the battery fully. I tested the phone with all the radios on and the brightness set to 50%-60%. The Motion outlasts many of today's big-screened devices, though BlackBerry's own KEYone lasts even longer.. The Motion ships with BlackBerry's Boost Mode, which is more about charging than it is about conserving battery. With Boost Mode enabled, the phone will use as little power as possible as it charges, thereby allowing it to charge more swiftly. I found the phone does in fact charge faster when Boost Mode is enabled. Technically, the phone supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 and includes a QC3 charger in the box. One thing I like: you can choose to see the battery charge status on the screen's edge when the phone is sleeping.. The Motion doesn't support wireless charging.. I cannot lodge any complaints about the Motion's secondary radios. The handset's Bluetooth radio paired and connected with headphones, speakers, and other accessories without fuss. I was pleased with calls made via Bluetooth headphones. Just as with the earpiece, clarity was good and volume was good enough. Calls patched through my car's hands-free system were very good. Music sounded decent when used with stereo headphones, though I have heard better.. GPS worked perfectly on the Motion. Google Maps pinpointed me in several blinks of an eye and was always within 15 to 20 feet. The app ran fluidly over AT&T's LTE network. The phone was a reliable real-time navigation tool.. The NFC radio was helpful in pairing with some Bluetooth accessories. The NFC also supports Android Pay for mobile payments.. The WiFi did its job with gusto.. The KEYone is made by TCL and it runs Google's Android operating system, but this phone clearly has the heart and soul of a BlackBerry beating within. BlackBerry and TCL designed the KEYone together to ensure it offers the best from BlackBerry, TCL, and Google.. BlackBerry Motion Eschews the Keyboard, Packs Huge Battery. TCL today announced the BlackBerry Motion, a follow-up to the KEYone that drops the keyboard in favor of a larger touch screen. The Motion boasts a 5.5-inch full HD screen that's covered in a nano-diamond coating to prevent scratches.. TCL Promises Two New QWERTY BlackBerries as Motion Hits U.S. TCL Communication today said it plans to introduce two new BlackBerry-branded handsets this year, both of which will feature physical QWERTY keyboards. They will serve as successors to last year's KEYone handset.. Hands On with TCL's New BlackBerry Smartphone. TCL today showed off a unique BlackBerry smartphone that includes both a physical QWERTY keyboard and a touch screen. This large slab is meant to help reinvigorate sales of BlackBerry smartphones to businesses.. The DTEK50 runs BlackBerry's apps and services on Google's operating system and Alcatel's hardware. It's a curious collaboration of sorts that adds up to a better 'Berry.. 4 GB RAM 4,000 mAh battery. Headphone Jack (3.5mm), Water-Resistant, Memory Card Slot, NFC, Fingerprint Reader. You must log in to post.. Why do they even bother with non-keyboard phones?. The KeyONE is the best BlackBerry to date, and they should just continue to support and improve upon that design, without making it any larger and I think they could carve out a niche again of people who value having a great keyboard, and a modern OS ;-). 2015 called and they want their SOC back!.

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. It’s not the most exciting, but it is essentially immortal. This all-screen Android offers a flavour of the BlackBerry experience in a more modern, water-resistant package. It’s held back by dated hardware and a lacklustre camera, but impressive battery life means workaholics might just love it.. BlackBerry Motion price and availability The middle manager of phones Standard-issue hardware Generous battery pack Design Smart, sensible design Awkward button placement Solid and weighty Display Full HD LCD Anti-scratch coating Can be slippery. As ever, the codename for this BlackBerry was far cooler than the one it ended up with. The rumoured all-touch ‘Krypton’ became the BlackBerry Motion, a label less baffling than some of the brand’s previous choices ( Priv , Passport , DTEK60 …) but still not nearly as intoxicating as its temporary name implied.. The same can be said of the handset, which fulfils the BlackBerry image perfectly: it’s a solid middle-of-the-road phone with little to get excited about.. Highlights include the generous 4,000mAh battery, the highly-regarded BlackBerry security software, and some extras that - while fairly standard in the Android market - are not common to BlackBerry phones.. These include dual-SIM capability, IP67-rated water resistance, and a 5.5-inch 1080p screen with no hardware keyboard on or underneath it. Really, this is the phone BlackBerry should have produced when it was busy trying to make BlackBerry 10 happen, but that ship has very much sailed.. The Motion costs a little less than its hard-keyed sibling, coming in at £399 (around $535, AU$705) to the KeyOne's £499 ($549, AU$729), though there's no word yet on a US or Australian release.. That price pits it directly against well-reviewed droids including the diminutive Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact , the slightly ageing LG G6 , and fellow back-from-the-dead brand effort, the Nokia 8 - plus there's just £50 (around $65, AU$90) between it and the excellent OnePlus 5T .. The BlackBerry Motion seems designed more for the mainstream than some of BlackBerry’s previous releases: it has an accessible price point, has picked up some useful features from its competitors, and doesn’t have a big (and arguably these days, pointless) keyboard underneath.. Effort (and money) has been focused on the areas that matter most in the workplace, with everything else just ‘Okay’ - there are no deal breakers, but it’s hard to get hyped about standard-issue features like a 1080p LCD screen and 12MP camera. Even the storage is meh: 32GB on board, plus a microSD slot.. The two features BlackBerry Mobile will be counting on to shift this device are the enormous and slow-to-discharge 4000mAh battery pack, and the boss-appeasing security enhancements on top of Android Nougat.. In that sense, it’s really speaking directly to the besuited man on the commuter train - and his IT manager. Which, given BlackBerry’s total loss of brand cachet in the consumer market, is not a bad call.. The BlackBerry Motion is a surprisingly heavy phone for a mid-ranger. The smart aluminium trim around the edges adds class and bulk, although the metallic strip which runs across the back and curves around to the top of the screen is, in fact, plastic.. The back panel sports a textured carbon fibre-esque pattern with the BlackBerry logo embossed in silver.. The logo also makes an appearance on the physical home key on the (massive) bezel below the screen, which incorporates a pleasingly responsive fingerprint sensor and can be swiped up and down like a touchpad to control the notification shade. However, you have to swipe slowly and decisively, or it often doesn’t work.. As you’d expect on a ‘chin’ bezel that size, there are capacitive Back and Apps buttons on either side of the home key, which light up when in use and gradually fade out.. We found this a bit annoying when reading ebooks on the phone, because turning the page counted as interacting with the device and turned the backlight on again, which meant it was always on and off while we were trying to read.. The left edge of the handset surprisingly offers no buttons, just the SIM tray. This wouldn’t be an issue except that in cramming all the keys onto the right edge, BlackBerry has ensured that you constantly mix up the power key and the programmable ‘convenience key’, which is bafflingly textured to make it seem even more like a power key.. Hand your BlackBerry Motion to someone with the screen off and we guarantee you they’ll try to use the convenience key to turn the screen on. It’s bad design, plain and simple: that key should be on the left.. Nonetheless, a programmable hardware key is a nice thing to have, and the Motion’s can be set up to launch three different apps or actions.. There are plenty to choose from, but it seems like a real oversight not to be able to program three different interactions to open them. If you choose one shortcut, it’ll launch instantly when you press the button.. We assumed the second would be two quick presses and the third a long press, but not so - set up more than one shortcut and the convenience button just pops up a menu with the three icons on it. Which isn’t all that convenient at all. You can set it up to do different things while in different profiles, or use it as a mute button on a call, however.. Above the (actual) power key is a standard volume rocker bar, which leaves the 3.5mm headphone jack, USB-C charging port and speaker to be found on the bottom edge.. The screen on the BlackBerry Motion sums up the phone in many ways. It’s a 5.5-inch IPS LCD panel, 1080p, 401 pixels per inch.. In other words, it’s a standard size (with the standard 16:9 aspect ratio), a slightly-outdated resolution (FHD, not QHD), not the latest tech (LCD, not OLED), with clarity and quality that’s good, but not the best. It’s fine for the price, but - like the phone - it’s not going to knock anyone’s socks off.. The screen is coated with ‘a proprietary nano-diamond anti-scratch coating’ (notably not the industry-leading Gorilla Glass) and has a slight curve rather than the much more pronounced, Samsung-ish rounding on the BlackBerry Priv display.. It’s a little fingerprinty, but our main issue was that it’s incredibly slippery: put your phone screen-down on the desk in a meeting and it will be on the floor within seconds.. Face up, it’s fine thanks to the grippy finish on the back panel, but you really can’t put this phone face down on any surface. Not a huge problem for most people, but considering BlackBerry’s businessy audience, it does seem an oversight not to be able to conform to the meeting politeness standard of flipping your phone over.. The display offers decent brightness, but the top level isn’t as blinding as you’d expect - it’s just bright. Colours are decently saturated but not overly so, and colour temperature can be adjusted with a slider in settings.. There’s also the now-ubiquitous night mode (somewhat confusingly called Night Light) that cuts down on sleep-disrupting blue light.. This is the setting to switch on when you use the Motion to read in the bath before bed, since it’s water and dust proof to the IP67 standard.. You can dunk it for up to half an hour - which of course, we did - and the phone suffers no adverse effects. As ever, though, we wouldn’t recommend making a habit of it..
