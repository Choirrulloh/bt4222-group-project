There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great Value. First off...I have had many Blu phones over the years. I must say this one seems to be the best , so far. The phone setup was all good, loaded my usual apps, and it runs very smooth. Although the screen is a lower resolution, the colors and sharpness are more than good enough, for my needs. Netfix played fine, external speaker was plenty loud for my needs. Sound itself, is not too tinny, and has a little richness to it. Music as well, was pretty decent sounding. Managed to pair the phone with my car without issue. All in all, pretty good phone for the money. Still need to play around with the camera a little, but so far I'm pleased with the results. Please note for those mentioning the lack of quick settings(BT, brightness, flashlight, etc) you need to pull up from the bottom of the screen, to access those. No regrets in this purchase, I would buy it again. Edit....to the person who said it doesn't have face unlock, you have to set up smart Lock, to access that feature. So no, I don't believe they actually lied. Edit #2..I uploaded a few pics, pretty nice.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great phone at unbelievable price. This is my third Blu phone. I have finished setting up this phone and am really impressed! I was a little concerned after reading some reviews that said there was no quick access menu. I'm guessing that Blu fixed an issue that was in the test phones. Anyway, this device is fast, has lots of storage, a good amount of RAM, and a price that can't be beat.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars An amazing competitor in the unlocked smart phones market!. I bought this phone to add my 2 SIM Cards when traveling outside the country in order to avoid carrying 2 phones from AT&T and T-Mobile. Everything is this phone is almost perfect! (My carrier phones are LG G6 and LG V30), and this phone has almost everything that I have on my flagship devices, even more! - Sound with headphones is MUCH better than LG's thanks to it MaxxAudio Chip that brings an excellent audio experience (Wired, Wireless and Phone Speaker) - Selfie Camera: Definitively beat the LG's, the only advise is to install Camera Zoom Pro ($1.99 in Google Play), it will take perfect photos for main and selfie cameras since the native camera software won't do a good job for the camera set. - Battery: A heavy daily use with no compromise. It will be enough for a full day of use. - Screen: Despite the specs, it is as good as the LG V30 in the same format 18:9 - Security and Fingerprint Scanner: As good as any other flagship phone, fast and reliable. - Design: Beautiful, you can't notice if you have the One Plus 5T or a BLU phone ;) - Internal Memory, RAM and Processor speed: At the level of my LG V30! - Phone comes with a very cool case, pre-applied screen protector and great fast charger. Some improvements needed: - No WiFi Calling: Please BLU, work on this and implement it in coming software releases! (It would make a true flagship phone) - MicroUSB charging port: C'mon! It's 2018! (It should be now USB Type C) - Business eMail App like Samsung, LG, Apple, etc. - Maybe an IP-67 or 68 for next devices? (that would make it perfect!). Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Good job BLU!!!. This was BLU's last chance with me, and I must say they have hit it out of the park. What you have to remember is that you didn't pay $1,000 for this phone, you paid ~$200 for it. It is fast and solid phone. Works with MintSIM, the other two I had, I couldn't get sms to work at all. An unlocked phone that won't work with a carrier? My Moto G5S plus works right out of the box. I will be running 2 sims soon and although I'm not crazy about the either or of the SIM or SD card arrangement, it does have 64gig of internal storage which is plenty for me. I love the cameras ,and there are 4 of them, and the card scan feature. It scans a card and fills in the information for you. And it works!!! If you are planning on an update to oreo? DON'T!!! BLU is NOT known for updating their phones, IF you are planning on immediate updates to the newest software, you are looking at the wrong company!!!! Look at their website, they have like 4 phones that are available to update to marshmallow!!! Oreo? Really?... IF you want all the stuff that goes with a flagship, spend $1,000 and buy a flagship. If you budget won't allow that kind of spending and you are ok with "out-dated" software, then go for it!. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing phone, works great with Cricket.. I try to get out but they pull me right back in. In our home we have used Blu mobile phones for some years now. Often slow on the updates but consistent quality. For starters the finger print scanner is crazy fast. The face recognition also works fine "regardless to what others have said". The screen is bright and crisp. Do i expect the OS to get an upgrade.. Probably not, Blu has often been very slow with the OS updates if they update it at all. At this price point i don't mind getting a newer Blu mobile every year or two. Face, finger print, passwords and patterns. Charges quickly and the battery lasts. Cons: The option try comes up from the bottom. It came with a case that is feeling more like thin plastic then a thicker gel case. The biggest con for me right now is the lack of case options Why still a five star rating? Anything that is really a con right now is just personal preference and doesn't bring down the rating at all. Someone out there make some cases, Hard Shell with inner rubber lining, Gel case to replace the supplied case. Dang i would even go with something that flips over the screen like the old Blu Life One Xs had. Im sure i will check in daily to try to spot a case.. Was this review helpful to you?. I was very excited to place an order under a promo offer (199.99) .. however I ended up receiving a defective one , front camera flash doesn’t work form the moment I started to... 1.0 out of 5 stars Front Camera - flash not working. This is my first Blu phone to date and I'm very impressed both by price (I was able to purchase at the $199 promo) and build quality. 5.0 out of 5 stars Quality at a great price!. Just received this phone 2 days ago and so far it's has impressed me very much. I have owned several blu phones and this one it's so fat the best I ever had. 5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive. IT DOESN'T HAVE FACE UNLOCK , I would give this phone 5 Stars if they didn't lie and say that the Blu vivo X has face unlock !!! Read more. 2.0 out of 5 stars NO FACE UNLOCK....LIE. Well I'm not sure where to start... The phone itself was amazing, software wise the phone was very fast and reliable. I've had it less than 24 hours. 1.0 out of 5 stars CHEAPEST GLASS I'VE EVER SEEN!!!. It keeps going up sleep mode in less than 30 seconds. Trying to troubleshoot it but not making progress. Also Not compatible to my Samsung gear 2 watch. 2.0 out of 5 stars It's ok. I upgraded and wanted to make sure I got the most phone for my money so when this went on sale for $199 I knew it was the right one. 5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely solid phone.... I just received this phone today. This phone is awesome! So far no complaints. I will update after a few weeks of use.. 5.0 out of 5 stars So far so good. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars.

BLU VIVO X Review – A Very Good Budget Flagship. Android , BLU , Pocketables , Reviews. MediaTek 6757, octa-core CPU @ 2.6 GHz. 13 MP + 5 MP with LED Flash. 20 MP + 8 MP with LED Flash. BLU is known for producing relatively high-quality phones for relatively low budgets. The VIVO X is something new for them. Their marketing team calls it a flagship phone and it certainly is relative to the other phones in their lineup. It isn’t a Pixel 2 XL or a Galaxy S8 but it does feature a 6 inch 18:9 display and some nifty tricks that make it just about the best low-cost ( $250! ) phone I’ve tested. Keep reading for all the details.. The first thing that stands out about the VIVO X is the elongated six inch screen. It’s 18:9 (2:1?) aspect and 80% screen-to-body ratio places this phone squarely in 2018 and does wonders to make the phone feel modern. It has narrow side bezels and trim top/bottom bezels, as well. The Gorilla Glass 3 covering the LCD is curved slightly at the edges, though the LCD is flat, giving it a premium feel and look. The body is all-aluminum and perfectly thin at 8.2 mm. The thing just feels great to hold. The thickness to heft to size proportions are just spot on.. Above the display are dual selfie cameras and an LED flash. The volume rocker and power button are on the right side and the combination SIM/SD tray are on the left. All of the corners and edges are nicely rounded. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely feels like a premium device.. The back of the device is an aluminum sheet with a nicely embossed BLU logo. There’s a fingerprint reader right where you’d expect it to be about 3/4 up the phone. There is also a dual camera setup on the back.. The VIVO X is, as typical with BLU phones, running on a MediaTek platform. Specifically it is the MediaTek Helio P25 octa-core system clocked at 2.6 GHz. There’s 4 GB RAM and 64 GB internal storage. You can add an additional 64 GB storage via microSD.. Swiping around and navigation are smooth. Every touch and swipe is registered properly. It doesn’t approach Pixel 2 levels of responsiveness but it does an admirable job. Another thing to note is the fingerprint reader. Like Moto Z2 or Pixel 2 fast.. Geekbench 4 scores the VIVO X out somewhere in the Galaxy Note 5 or Galaxy S7 range. That’s honestly not bad for a phone that costs $250 and is the best scoring BLU phone I’ve tested to date.. The non-removable battery weighs in at an admirable 4010 mAh and will get most people through the greater part of a day.. With any phone in this price range there will be compromises. The screen is the first one on the VIVO X. It’s a 720×1440 6 inch LCD panel at 268 PPI. The best way to think of it is as a stretched 720p display. In fact, I was surprised at how “not bad” it is for most applications. But it would be nice to see a little higher resolution screen.. The VIVO X is another BLU device with a minimal skin on Android 7.0, though there are a few notable differences from vanilla Android. Most notable, for me, is the iPhone-esque swipe up from the bottom of the screen to reveal the control panel. I just don’t understand this need to ape Apple on things that are handled better natively in Android. There’s also the standard BLU features like MiraVision that allows you to punch up (or down, I guess) the screen saturation a bit.. One place you’ll want to head in Settings is the Full Screen module where you can choose which apps use the entire display. By default, some apps will behave as if they are on a 16:9 screen and show black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. Forcing them to fit the entire screen works great, for the most part, and if you come across an app that doesn’t play nicely you can simply untoggle the full screen feature for it. One mark against this feature is that when apps update, they need to be toggled back on again.. The camera is a special point of emphasis for BLU on the VIVO X. It’s the first phone I’ve seen with dual cameras on the front and back of the phone. It’s a neat feature that allows for iPhone-like 1X zoom and bokeh affects. The front camera array is 20 + 8 MP with an F2.0 aperture. The rear features 13 + 5 MP, F2.0 shooters.. That said, the camera isn’t great but it does a mostly good job. The optical zoom feature is fantastic but bright colors do get a bit blown out. They come out looking a little fuzzy. There are plenty of effects built into the camera app like panorama, beautify, slow-mo, GIF, and more.. The VIVO X is a nice step forward for BLU. They’ve added features not normally seen on budget devices like the 18:9 screen and dual cameras while managing to keep costs down. The phone feels premium but won’t break the bank at only $250. Check it out if you are in the market for a new phone at a great price.. I'm a long-time tech and gadget enthusiast that currently uses Android, Windows 10 Mobile, and iOS devices. I'm always interested in ways to improve my family's life with new devices and services, though my beautiful wife might just say I'm addicted to playing with gadgets..

The BLU Vivo X launches on Amazon with four cameras for $299. We are just days away from seeing a slew of new devices launched that will burn holes in our pockets. However, BLU is looking to help you save a few bucks and has announced its latest ‘flagship’ device with the BLU Vivo X.. The device sports a 6-inch display with an aspect ratio of 18:9, along with a resolution of 1440 x 720. Powering the Vivo X is the MediaTek 6757 chipset, which has been coupled with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage.. BLU upped its game with the Vivo X, as smartphone cameras continue to become more and more important. On the front, we have a dual-camera setup with a. primary 20MP sensor and a secondary 120-degree wide-angle 8MP sensor, which will allow you make sure that everyone is in the shot.. Moving to the rear, there is another dual-camera system, with a primary 13MP sensor and a secondary 5MP sensor. This secondary sensor is said to help provide “depth of field” shots, which adds a Portrait Mode of sorts. Once the image has been taken, BLU has included software which will help enhance the image, to make sure that it truly pops.. Other specs for the Vivo X include a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, along with a massive 4,010mAh battery. BLU has included a quick charger, allowing you to go from 0% to 100% in just 2.5 hours.. BLU has also included some nice software additions, which include Face Unlock, allowing users to unlock their device without needing to use a pin code or the fingerprint scanner. However, for those who want to use the rear-mounted scanner, BLU claims you can unlock your device in just 0.2 seconds, which is rather fast for a budget device.. The BLU Vivo X is already listed on Amazon, but will officially be released to everyone on February 27th for $299. For a limited time, BLU is discounting the Vivo X by $50, bringing the price down to just $249. If you want to pick one up for yourself, hit the button down below!.

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Octa-core, 2600 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 16 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running..

BLU’s line of Android-powered smartphones have always been known to be aggressively priced! Most people would be left to think that they’re simply cheap products, but thankfully there is noticeable attention to their designs and specs – so in that regard, they do offer a considerable amount of value.. With its latest flagship model for this year, the BLU VIVO X, it’s taking all the trends we’ve been seeing all of last year and accompanying it with an irresistible price point.. Honestly, our first impressions about the BLU VIVO X is that it suspiciously looks a lot like the OnePlus 5T. Sporting that trendy all-screen, minimal bezel design that has taken off last year, combined with a premium aluminum housing, we have to give it props for being a stunner.. Sure, it’s not as refined, evident by how there’s a slight gap surround the glass panel on front, but the overall package is still nonetheless impressive – more so when it includes a headphone jack and fingerprint sensor.. On the front of the phone, the main draw here is the 6-inch 720 x 1440 display with Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3. Naturally, it follows the trend of adopting an 18:9 screen-aspect-ratio – with minimal bezels along the left and right edges.. While the resolution is just a smidgen lower than other comparable phones in its class, it’s still detailed enough to make out small text. However, the colors and iridescence of the display seems subdued.. Other features for the BLU VIVO X include an octa-core MediaTek 6757 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, microSD card slot, 4010 mAh battery, and Android 7.0 Nougat. Considering this is BLU we’re talking about, we’re really curious to know whether this flagship will be treated to future Android updates in a timely manner, seeing that its phones are notorious for not getting upgraded.. Despite that, you’ll be fascinated by the trove of cameras it’s packing. In fact, the rear camera features a dual configuration (13MP + 5MP) that’ll deliver those bokeh effects that have been synonymous with phones of late. We took a few samples in our short time, and so far, we’re not totally impressed by the results.. Additionally, it’s worth noting that it also sports a dual-camera system with its front cameras – a 20MP + 8MP dual camera. This pairing, however, is meant to deliver a wider capture, similar to the cameras found with LG’s smartphones.. Needless to say, they’re able to cram a whole lot into the BLU VIVO X. Flaunting all of last year’s trend into a premium looking body, the BLU VIVO X certainly has a potential to attract buyers with its hard-to-beat price of $199.99 on Amazon, which is available for a limited time as a launch deal. Afterwards, it’ll go back to its normal price point of $249.99.. Sony Xperia XZ2 Hands-on Review : First look. Lenovo Yoga 730 Hands-on Review : First look.
