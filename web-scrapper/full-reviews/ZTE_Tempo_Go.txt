Author by Mario Cincaroski February 25, 2018. ZTE is among the many companies that are trying to compete in every range of the smartphone world. They’ve released many new devices recently, with the most notable being the dual-screen ZTE Axon M. Today, a day before MWC officially starts, they announced many new devices for this year. One of them is the ZTE Tempo Go, an entry-level smartphone that is among the first to run Android Go. Let’s see what can this device offer.. Starting with the design, on first look, I find it oddly intriguing. Not that it is anything special – it has a plastic back with metal on the sides, but the texture and placement of the components give it a minimalistic look. Plus, the grey variations on the back give it a stealthier look, a thing I like, but it doesn’t have to mean the same for you. On the front, you will find the 5” display with 480×584 resolution. It doesn’t pack in the famous 18:9 aspect ratio, but I can forgive it in this price range. Despite this fact, it is good to see that the bottom bezel is used for the navigation buttons. On the back, you will find the camera setup in the top corner, with a single speaker on the bottom part. The ZTE logo sits proudly in the middle.. As you could expect, the ZTE Tempo Go is not for those that want power. Instead, you’re getting the best value for a low price. With that in mind, the Tempo Go is packing the Snapdragon 210, a quad-core processor with a clock speed of 1.1GHz. On the memory side, you’re getting 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. The RAM should be enough for basic tasks, though don’t expect any hard-multitasking work done on it. The storage is pretty low in my opinion, but luckily it can be expanded with a MicroSD card. To end the hardware part, the Tempo Go will feature a 2200mAh battery. Considering the small display and low internals in it, it should be more than enough to last you through a day.. On the camera side, again, you’re not getting anything amazing. The ZTE Tempo Go will feature a 5MP rear and 2MP front camera. The rear one is accompanied by a flash, and it should be decent for a casual photograph or to capture a moment. Same thing with the front – aside from a casual selfie in good lightning conditions, don’t expect anything special.. Ending with the most exciting part, the ZTE Tempo Go is one of the first devices to ship with Android Go. For those of you that don’t know, Android Go is a special version of Android Oreo optimized for devices with 1GB of RAM or lower. It packs in many enhancements and optimizations that make the device run smoothly. Plus, it packs in Go versions of Google’s apps that are reduced in size and some features, while keeping the core purpose.. The ZTE Tempo Go is available for purchase unlocked on ZTE’s site, with a price of $79.. What are your thoughts on the ZTE Tempo Go? Share them in the comments below..

How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. ZTE Tempo Go is an Android Go for the US. JC Torres - Feb 25, 2018. Google has unleashed the scouting party for Android Go upon the world and we’ve heard from the likes of Nokia, Alcatel, and India’s General Mobile. Availability of the Android Go phones from those, however, are targeted mostly at emerging markets. But who’s to say that those in the US don’t want an extremely affordable but still usable Android phone? ZTE definitely thinks so and it is making the ZTE Tempo Go, one of if not the first Android Go phone for the US market, available exactly for that purpose.. There is, perhaps, a presumption that all smartphone users in the US are very tech savvy, well to do, and crave the latest and greatest. Of course, no one size fits all when it comes to smartphones. Some really just want a basic communication device that happens to also bring the Internet into their pockets.. That’s precisely what Android Go was made for, a special configuration, not version, of Android designed to work well on very low-end phones. Google mostly defines that as phones with 1 GB of RAM or less and not so much processing power. All while still offering the staples of modern Android experience, even including Google Assistant, while not locking such devices down on ancient Android versions. Android Go is based on Android 8.1 Oreo, more up-to-date than even some more expensive flagships.. And that’s exactly what the ZTE Tempo Go brings to the table. It runs on a 1.1 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 210, which already sets it apart from the other MediaTek-based Android Go phones, and has 1 GB of RAM and only 8 GB of storage. The 5.0-inch screen has a resolution of 854×480 FWVGA. The cameras are going to be the most disappointing parts of the phone, with a 5 megapixel shooter on the back and a measly 2 megapixels on the front.. It won’t disappoint in price, however. ZTE USA will be selling the ZTE Tempo Go for only $79.99. Exact availability hasn’t been announced yet.. The first Android Go phones will bring affordable Oreo to MWC.

It is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. GPU is a graphical processing unit, which handles computation for 2D/3D graphics applications. In mobile devices GPU is usually utilized by games, UI, video playback, etc. GPU can also perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the CPU.. The frequency is the clock rate of the graphic processor (GPU), which is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. RAM (Random-Access Memory) is used by the operating system and all installed applications. Data in the RAM is lost after the device is turned off or restarted.. Information about the number of RAM channels integrated in the SoC. More channels mean higher data transfer rates.. RAM frequency relates directly to the rate of reading/writing from/in the RAM memory.. Information about the capacity of the built-in storage of the device. Sometimes one and the same model may is offered in variants with different internal storage capacity.. The various types of memory cards are characterized by different sizes and capacity. Information about the supported types of memory cards.. One of the main characteristics of the display is its type/technology, on which depends its performance.. In mobile devices display size is represented by the length of its diagonal measured in inches.. The ratio between the long and the short side of the display. The display resolution shows the number of pixels on the horizontal and vertical side of the screen. The higher the resolution is, the greater the detail of the displayed content.. Information about the number of pixels per centimeter (ppcm) or per inch (ppi) of the display. The higher the pixel density, the more detailed and clearer is the information displayed on the screen.. The color depth of the display is also known as bit depth. It shows the number of bits used for the color components of one pixel. Information about the maximum number of colors the screen can display.. The estimated percentage of the screen area from the device's front area.. Information about other functions and features of the display.. Sensors vary in type and purpose. They increase the overall functionality of the device, in which they are integrated.. Digital cameras use image sensors for taking photos. The sensor characteristics are some of the main factors determining the quality of the camera integrated in the mobile device.. Cameras of mobile devices use mainly a LED or a Xenon flash. The LED flash has a softer burst of light and in contrast to the much brighter Xenon flash, is used for recording videos as well..
