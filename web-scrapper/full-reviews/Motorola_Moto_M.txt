A Failed Lenovo Experiment now called Moto M. By VSK | 27 Dec 2016. I am a serial Moto Buyer and this is my 8th Phone. Buying this phone was an absolute nightmare. Delivery delayed by 2 weeks! But for 7k couldn't have expected any worse. Even Flipkart bribed me with Rs 300 GC to keep calm about it.. this phone is - A Failed Lenovo Experiment now called Moto M.... It has almost all likeness to a Lenovo Make.. But what the heck Lenovo makes both the makes. Here is what I think of the phone. Phone Build: 5 Stars! Very neat and well built. Processor: 5 Stars! MediaTek's Helio P10/P15 (MT6755) packs a mean punch. Never seen an Android run that fast and smooth. Graphics: 4 Stars! Apart from the occasional bumps Mali-T860MP2 does deliver high end graphics (played Asphalt 8, Real Racing & F1 2016).. 1080 x 1920 pixels (~401 ppi pixel density) HD display. Very smooth, but not crisp or sharp.. Phone Reception: 4 Stars! Its is very clear without much noise or disturbances.. Battery: 3 Stars! Non-removable Li-Po 3050 mAh battery for a Octa Core is less. Won't last more than a day!. Dual Sim: 3 Stars! Dual SIM (Nano-SIM, dual stand-by).. Its not right to give one sim slot to run on 4g and one on 3g!. Headphone, Audio Output: 3 Stars! Average sound output even with Dolby Atmos. Needed additional apps and better headphones.. Camera: 2 Stars! Very Mediocre 16 MP Camera with a Lenovo Camera App & No Gallery! That Sucks! Biggest flaw in this phone. The Hype: Yepp, its sold out! But, I remember a similar instance in 1997 when Oasis's Be Here Now album released, it was a record sell out. But people later realized, it wasn't that good enough. Bottom Line: Go for Moto Z Play if you don't mind spending extra 5-7 quid!!. Was this review helpful?

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. by Peter Kostadinov. Motorola - Motorola + Android - Android +. 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction Believe it or not, Motorola hasn't changed much since it got acquired by Chinese giant Lenovo. It is still launching phones of all categories and is still selling them at reasonable prices. For instance, the Moto Z was a killer high-end when it launched, while the Moto G4 , the Moto G4 Play , and the Moto G4 Plus are all good examples of how a budget smartphone should be made. The Moto M is positioned somewhere between these two tiers. As an Android mid-range model, it checks all the right boxes – it has good specs, great design, and an affordable price. On paper, this sounds like а winning combination, but in real life, is the Moto M worth considering at all? Armed with a decent amount of curiosity, we took it upon ourselves to find out! Design A sleek, well-built phone that feels like a more expensive device It may look a bit generic in pictures, but in actuality, the Motorola M is a sleek, well-built device that feels quite pleasant in the hand. It's a solid metal-made handset that's not much larger than the Moto Z Play Droid, but is arguably more stylish thanks to the minimalistic and streamlined design. Size-wise, the Moto M is relatively compact for a 5.5-incher. It's no bigger than the Moto G4 or the OnePlus 3/3T, for example. With a depth of 0.31” (7.85mm), the handset is not very thin, but we have no qualms with how this one feels in hand. It's not a heavyweight trooper, either – it tips the scales at only 5.75 oz (163gr), which is lighter than the average weight of a 5.5-inch phone. There are no navigation buttons at the front, only a Moto logo at the bottom will be reminding you what phone you're handling. In the meantime, the back of the phone doesn't even feature the signature Moto dimple – there's a circular fingerprint scanner at the rear instead. The “less is more” mantra is doing the Moto M a great service, and we really like how this one looks. It's also worth noting that the Moto M is a splash-resistant device, which means that it will survive small splashes of water or a drizzle. Don't dunk it into the pool, though, as it's unlikely to survive the ordeal.. At the bottom of the device, one would find a reversible USB Type-C port – great! Immediately to the right of it we find a single loudspeaker. If you're looking for the 3.5mm audio jack, rest assured there is one, it's just at the top of the phone. Finally, the volume rocker and the power button provide very good clicky feedback; the textured pattern on the the power button provides a grippy feeling, which is something we like. All things considered, it wouldn't be too far-fetched to say that the Moto M is built and feels like a more expensive phone. Credit where it's due – no corners have been cut in terms of the handset's design. Display Sufficiently sharp yet not as accurate as we'd like it to be The Moto M brings along a 5.5-inch IPS LCD display with the acceptable resolution of 1080 by 1920 pixels. Though we've seen sharper, the display will be more than adequate for 9 out of 10 users. However, there's much more to phone displays than resolution alone. Chief among those other properties is color temperature, and the Moto M is not as accurate as we'd like it to be. For starters, the display is 'cold' – it clocks in at 8452K, which is way higher than the standard 6500K color temperature. This makes white colors way bluer than they should be. A common flaw for many affordable devices, but a flaw indeed. There are two display settings – Standard and Vibrant. Even in the standard one, the Moto M's display has the tendency to oversaturate green, yellow, and red colors, though not excessively so. Switch to Vibrant, however, and all colors become overly vivid and totally inaccurate. Needless to say, we are not fans of that, so we kept the display in its standard mode. The display's gamma is mostly correct, which means that contrast representation is accurate. Maximum and minimum brightness levels are both acceptable - you will have no problems with outdoor visibility or using the phone before bedtime.. 5.96 x 2.97 x 0.31 inches. 151.35 x 75.35 x 7.85 mm. 6.02 x 3.02 x 0.39 inches. 153 x 76.6 x 9.8 mm. 6.01 x 2.94 x 0.29 inches. 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35 mm. 5.75 x 2.81 x 0.31 inches. 146.1 x 71.4 x 7.9 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Specifications News [14] Rivals Size it Videos.

Dimensions: 5.96 x 2.97 x 0.31 inches (151.35 x 75.35 x 7.85 mm). Weight: 5.75 oz (163 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 5.5 inches. Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 4), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 2200 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback, Dolby Atmos. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz.

Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

CNET también está disponible en español.. Is this the new Motorola Moto M?. Thanks to a recent leak, we may have our first look at the new Motorola Moto M.. November 2, 2016 1:40 PM PDT. Could this be the new Moto M? OnLeaks has a pretty good track record for right.. Tech blogger/editor Steve Hemmerstoffer released some in-depth pictures of the alleged Moto M both on his Twitter and his publication NowhereElse.fr. Hemmerstoffer also goes by the pseudonym OnLeaks and has a good track record of leaking pictures and specs of upcoming mobile devices that usually turn out to be on the money. The pictures posted are rather crude looks at the display, front-facing and rear cameras , the fingerprint sensor and the bezelless front.. Along with pictures , Hemmerstoffer also detailed some potential specs of the device, including a 5.5-inch screen with 1080p resolution, an eight-core 2.2GHz processor with 4GB of RAM, 13-megapixel rear camera and 8-megapixel front camera, and a 3,050mAh battery. The price of the Moto M is still unknown, but the specs put it in a similar tier as the Moto Z .. Motorola has been making cellphones for decades, but now struggles to keep up with giants like Apple and Samsung. Motorola was sold from Google to Lenovo in 2014, and since then hasn't really taken off. When Motorola added the Moto Z to its lineup of phones this year, its unique and innovative modular features caught the attention of the public. Now Moto continues to roll out new models of phones but time will tell if it's enough to bring people back to the brand.. While the Moto M has yet to be officially confirmed by Motorola, there is indication it will be unveiled at a Motorola event scheduled for November 8. Until then, this is merely speculation.. Motorola declined to comment after CNET's request for information.. Be respectful, keep it clean and stay on topic. We delete comments that violate our policy , which we encourage you to read.

Please ask the question in above box. How is the battery backup of this product?. It is only 7 months old phone and a fully charged phone lasts for only for 5hrs.. Data cord/ charging cable got damaged after 4 months of use. Service provider took 18 days to provide a new one. 2nd one is also not working Service centre person says that warranty is covered only for six months. What better can we expect from the Chinese manufacturers.. Don't buy any phone from Chinese manufacturers.. I am listening songs for 4 hrs and on calls for the whole day due to my work and still, I get the battery for one whole day.. The backup doesn't promising well but the rapid charging somehow helps top overcome that.. Good, but the battery backup needs improvement.. Have to charge twice a day for moderate use.. How many speakers are there in this phone?. it has two dolby atmos speakers situated at the bottom of the phone, the right speaker works as the left speaker is for calling and other things but in moto m you get dolby atmos which gives you rich audio quality like theater while watching movies or listening to songs and it is very loud as compared to other phones in the market.. Only one, mono type but sound very loud.. How is the sound quality of this phone?. It's such a great feeling about music....the speakers are well made and produce a adorable sound quality...and it's very touchy to beats quality volume.. Good, but after Android 7 update many issues were reported by the users.. except rear camera remaining all option are excellent... Music sound is good, calling sound is average.. How is the front and back camera quality of this phone?. good but not that good as compared to moto g4 plus, one more thing i wanna mention that if you want a good metal body phone with good camera and specs gof for new moto g5 plus it's better than every phone in the market.. Front camera quality is much better than rear camera. The rear camera quality is good if the phone is stable.. The front camera is excellent and the back camera is good in full daylight but it's too bad in the lowlight.. Camera Quality is Average,not up to the Standards of a 16MP camera.. Camera is good in daylight not in dark.. Does it have a dedicated slot for memory and sim or not?. The user can use either one nano-SIM and a memory card or both the SIMs at a time only. No dedicated memory slot with dual SIM option.. It has a hybrid slot, where you can place two items i.e. either one SIM and a memory card or both the SIMs and no memory card.. If you use one SIM, then you can use it as a memory slot. But if you use two SIMs, then you can't use it as a memory slot.. No, it has a hybrid slot i.e. you can either use dual SIM or one SIM and one memory card.. which means you have to choose either 2nd sim or memory card..

Pros: El envío tardó más o menos dos semanas. La caja del teléfono llegó en buenas condiciones y con el sello sin violar. En su caja además de lo habitual (el cargador es de 5.2V/2A, lo que otorga una buena velocidad de carga), venía una mica de plástico para la pantalla. La pantalla posee una buena calidad de visión. El sonido es magnífico y se pueden ajustar algunos parámetros para lograr una experiencia más increíble. La cámara cumple en la mayoría de condiciones, aunque la interfaz no es de lo mejor. El rendimiento en general no hay por qué quejarse, el procesador que tiene puede con las tareas del día a día y en algunas exigentes. La puntuación que obtuvo en AnTuTu fue de 50000 puntos. Cons: El slot de la SIM es híbrido: eliges si poner las dos tarjetas SIM o solamente una y la micro SD. La versión de Android con la que viene es 6.0 y hasta hoy no ha recibido Nougat. Viene con una estética diferente en la pantalla de inicio aunque fácilmente se puede sustituir con otro launcher. También mencionar que no incluye los gestos típicos de Motorola de la cámara y la linterna, y mucho menos la Moto pantalla. Por último y como es de esperarse, al menos en México sólo llega a 3G. Pero Telcel ha desplegado su red 4.5G a través de la banda B7, la cual este dispositivo sí tiene. No he realizado la prueba, pero en teoría sí podría alcanzar esa velocidad de datos móviles con ese operador.. Is this helpful? Yes ( 2 ) No ( 0 ).

Lenovo Moto M Review, Specification, Features and More. Lenovo has climbed to number two spot in the recent IDC number thanks to its wide portfolio. The most recent addition to its portfolio has been the Moto M. The newly launched phone looks dazing thanks to its slim figure, slightly curved edges, and metal body. Unlike Moto G4 Plus, the Moto M comes with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. In terms of the specification, the Moto M is powered by 2.2GHz octa-core Helio P15 which is ten percent more power efficient in comparison with Helio P10. The Mali-T860 MP2 GPU takes care of gaming and graphic needs. The phone comes with a 5.5-inch IPS LCD display with 1080x 1920pixels resolution, 401ppi pixel density, and 73.46 percent screen to body ratio. The top variant features 4GB RAM and 64GB storage, while a more base model with 3GB RAM and 32GB storage will also retail in India. For now, the Moto M will be running Android Marshmallow, but it you can expect the Android Nougat update to be around the corner. For shutterbugs, the handset bears a 16MP rear camera with PDAF and dual LED flash, alongside an 8MP selfie shooter with a wide angle lens. It comes with most of the usual connectivity options including NFC, USB OTG, 4G VoLTE, WiFi 802.11 AC, Bluetooth 4.1 LE and USB Type C. The phone has a splash resistant dual nano coating, supports Dolby Atmos for audiophiles and is aided by a 3050mAh battery. The Motorola Moto M (4GB + 64GB) best price is Rs. 17,999 which makes it is a lucrative deal considering the specification and features offers. Currently, it is exclusively retailing on Flipkart. For more updates on Lenovo Moto M price drops, deals and offers subscribe to Smartprix notifications.. Metal body Sharp display Near stock software Good camera hardware. The Moto M's design formula is one that's proven successful across a myriad of makers and generations of smartphones, so if it works for them, it should work here. The Moto M's specsheet is not without oMissions either (we'll move along as if that didn't happen). The power button is on the right side, perfectly high up to be accessed by the thumb of your right hand. On each of its sides you'll find a tiny screw, and a grille, but there's a loudspeaker behind the right one only.. Water-repellent nano-coating splash and dust resistant Rear-mounted fingerprint reader Type-C 1.0 reversible connector. No NFC Hybrid card slot limits usability. The Moto M is a good phone. It is well-designed, has not-too-shabby battery life, as well as an intuitive and light interface that does not feel overwhelming. True, it falls short in certain areas: the overall performance left us wanting more, the display is inaccurate in terms of color reproduction, and the camera's image quality could use a few improvements.. Stylish, sturdy, splash resistant device Nearly stock Android interface with no bloat Decent loudspeaker Good battery life. Middling performance Inaccurate display Image quality could be better Not available in any major Western market. super multi features in this cost. No need of keeping a name it.

No front flash No inbuilt applock No Moto secure folder. My sony's 8MP is much better than its 16mp camera. Processing is fast Sound is good. Camera is sooo bad Even the front camera is also very bad Design is very common like other china phones It's gold colour don't give a premium look. Metal body Good prosscer 4gb ram with 64gb internar Good back camera. Has Dolby sound which can be made quite loud & also sound clarity is v. good( comparing with Samsung gt 18262). Big display (with invert colors--good for saving battery) Turbo charging of Battery Usb "C"connection enable connection to PC. Battery life should have been bit more After 4 Month heavy use;battery discharges faster Slightly heavy. Moto M should be Released with good and full feature phone but it totally spoiled.. 4GB RAM with 64GB ROM Dolby Atmos Sleek Design with a Metal Body Camera With 16 and 8 MP. Processor is a major defect MEDIATEK HELIO P15 and MALI T860 Camera and Image Quality Could Be Better Too Cost Heating Issue Battery lacks with 3050mah. Enter each Pro in new line..

It is not worthy of rs.18000 it works as rs. I wasted my money by taking this phone. does this phone support carrier aggregation or Lte-Advanced ???. Hello friends, please find my opinion on Moto M which may be useful to you to make decision on purchasing new mobile phone. I bought Moto M online through Flipkart, after lots of search on 4gb and 64 gb catagorised phone. Finally decided to take this phone. For first 5 to 6 months it was working properly, but there after started giving me trouble. When mobile was completely switch off and u start again it was giving vertical lines and then it hangs. Application were not working, 4 gb phone behaves like 1 gb phone. Went to service center 6 times. They updated software even changed motherboard but no respite.. problems still continue only flicker problem on starting the phone is solved. This is my opinion with the product you may have different opinions. But as I understand lenevo and Moto products are not good. Speaker and camera quality is also not satisfactory. Anyway I wasted my 18k hard money. Please you think over before buying. When I purchased I was happy but within warranty period only my happiness is vanished... does this phone support carrier aggregation or Lte-Advanced ???.

The Moto M is here, featuring 4GB of RAM, 16MP camera, and lackluster processor. Lenovo's Moto M is now available in India, but will there be a U.S. Well folks, the Motorola Moto M is finally here, and unfortunately it’s a little unimpressive. The highly anticipated device was touted as being the Motorola flagship for those who. don’t want to shell out the cash for the Moto Z.. Some of the rumors surrounding the phone ended up being false — for example, it does not come with a huge 5,100mAh battery, which would put most flagship phones to shame. The phone, which was already available in China,. will also be available in India starting December 14, exclusively through Flipkart.. Apart from the battery, the device boasts either 3GB or 4GB of RAM and a hefty 16-megapixel rear-facing camera, which are pretty top-tier specs. The octa-core MediaTek Helio P15, however, shows that this phone isn’t the high performer that some were hoping for, and it seems a little out of place in a lineup of phones with Qualcomm chips.. You’ll also get a 1080p display and either 32GB or 64GB of storage. It’s currently unclear if the U.S. version will have the same specs, or if there will be a U.S. When it comes to the design, the phone looks pretty nice, but it’s not groundbreaking in any way. The gold color on the phone is a nice touch, but it’s not known if it will be available in other colors.. bad, but they leave a little to be desired. The device was released through a listing on China’s Tmall , which is the country’s Amazon equivalent. It comes with a price tag of $295, which isn’t a bad price, but the phone is a little lackluster compared to the likes of the LeEco Le Pro 3 and Xiaomi Mi 5s, which both come with the top-tier Snapdragon 821 processor and other high-end specs..

Backed by a great software but is let down by its endurance and camera. Likes-Great design, Feel, Look, excellent performance, Near Stock Android Experience and useful software enhancements. dislike - poor battery life, weak camera, no expandable storage and poor charging. 7 inch Amoled display with 312ppi which is pretty good as compared to phones such as Grand2 in thos category. The display is bright and clear and icons look Good with Android kitkat running In the device it make d viewing experience even better. Moto X sports 2gb RAM capable of perfoming tasks at ease.its has a 1.7Ghz dual core snapdragon s4 processor which is a beast!!! the phone performs multiple tasks with ease. The looks absolutely stunning with the different back panels available especially with d rose wood back case. The phone is stylish and Premium looking. The camera is highly disappointing factor of the phone, it sports a 10megapixel Autofocus camera with Led flash but it disappoints. the pictures quality is low and in low light the quality doesn't seem right. Its also haw a 2mp front facing camera. The call quality, downloading and uploading speed is very good.. Android kitkat makes the whole experience a charming one. It deserves 4 out of 5, one point taken away because of camera. i would recommend people who want a stylish, reliable, fast and Phone with a big screen go for Moto X!!!. Was this review helpful?

By now everybody would have already know about the hardware and software specs of this phone. This is the best phone for user experience on android. The only problem is that you cannot go just by specs, you have to experience it to believe it.. Everybody knows about its unique features like. 3) Flick wrist to launch Camera. But I just wanted to touch up on one thing which I came to know by experience only.. It is about choosing color of the back cover. The dark colored back covers like Black and Royal Blue has soft rubbery feel, so has better grip and won't slip easily. While the rest of the colors have smooth feel back cover which might be slippery. I am sure this would have been intentional since the dark soft touch back cover attracts dust and dirt and are not suitable for light color as it will get dirty very soon.. All back cover are of single piece plastic and blends well with the front, while the wood version are made of 2 pieces, first is the plastic frame and then second the wood itself. So, when you hold it you might feel that slight gap in between the wood and plastic frame. Above points might not matter a lot if you are planning to buy a case. But I dont prefer using case and I have gone for Royal Blue version. And I dont think you need a case.. Its a kind of phone which makes you feel good after using it rather than before using it which is the case with other spec heavy phones. And it is priced perfectly too.. This is the best phone in this range, so if its within your budget, "Buy it to Experience it and say Hello to Moto".. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful. Why Or Why Not MOTO X!!. By Anshuman Pandey | 1 May 2014. Many customers has experienced the engineering of Moto G which was recently launched in India and got great response.So, its time for Motorola to launch a new device here in India and yes its non other than Moto X, They have successfully launched Moto G recently which got tremendous response from Indian customers, excited from this Motorola’s new offering will be Motorola Moto X.. The Price of this device is Rs 23999/- For other plastic other than the wood back version while the wood back version will cost you Rs 25999/-.. Only 16 GB variant will be made available of the Indian Market.. Moto G Featured 4.5 Inch HD Screen with Gorrila Glass III, 1.2 Ghz Quad Core Processor,5 MP Camera with flash,1.2 MP Front facing camera,1 GB RAM,8 and 16 GB Offering.. Now, you can ask whats new in Moto x, Our answer will be there is nothing new in Moto X and the biggest drawback in Moto X is that it has 1.7 Ghz Dual core processor, despite its just the marketing tactics which has used by Flipkart and Motorola in order to create a hype with Moto G. Moto X specification is rather less than Moto G in which the pricing point of Moto X will be a differentiating factor for Motorola and Flipkart since many other brands are already offering same specification products at comparatively lower price.. Now, Coming to the specification of Moto X, it features 4.7 Inch AMOLED touch screen in HD , scratch resistant glass(Though Not Gorilla Glass) ,2 GB RAM, Adreno 320 GPU , Super clear 10 MP Camera,will be available in 16 & 32 GB Options.. The best part is that Flipkart will be lauching this device on 21st march and that too offering it with wooden back Panel the other thing to look for Moto X is at what price point Motorola will be offering this device to the customers.. 10 MP Super Clear Camera(60 FPS) With Flash And 2 MP Front Camera.

We usually land up buying a Maruti not just for the product but for its after sale service.. I picked up a Moto X in the first week of April 2014. Accidentally ended up dropping my phone only yesterday, the good part is, only the gorilla glass shattered and the phone is responding to my touch and display is not at all distorted.. I called up the Motorola consumer care which btw is very very bad. They did not know the price of the screen of Moto X and headed to the Motorola authorized customer care and they say that the price to replace your damages is Rs.10,000 INR odd because we don't change the gorilla glass alone and this will take upto 10 days coz we don't have the spare ready and your phone would be sent to Noida. (current location Udaipur) Since, the glass is clung to the LCD display the entire assembly will have to be replaced and even then, he was not sure about the price. To cross check, I called up another motorola authorized customer service station and they said, it will be replaced for Rs. 12,500/- that is half the phones price. I feel stupid because I would also have to pay for something which is functioning perfectly well along with the gorilla glass and buy a great some of money.. So, my opinion, get a phone insurance and get a bumper cover or whatever it is you require for your phone to stay intact coz Motorola will hardly entertain after sales calls even if you are willing to pay a wholesome amount..
