I've had this phone for about 18 months now. It cost less than A$200 and I never regretted buying it. It failed once in the first year and was repaired under warranty by Motorola. This phone has all the features that I wanted including compass and accelerometer sensors that are often not available in phones in this price range. The phone's main camera takes pretty good photos for its specs in daylight but the results are poor once the ambient light starts to fade. If I could change one thing on this phone it would be to give it a better battery life. Most of the time I get through the whole day before needing a charge but heavy use (especially with GPS on) can leave it going flat.. Do this phone have vietnamese language.

Updating to Lollipop provides a modernised clean interface, modelled on what Google refer to as Material Design. This new style will be prevalent on all Google's services to provide a synchronised experience. Notifications have also been overhauled; they are now less intrusive and allow you (if you choose) to respond directly from the lockscreen or not interrupt your viewing when playing full screen games or movies.. Power management for all users has now also been introduced - a power saving mode to reduce background processes has been included as well as advanced options for all Lollipop users.. The Android system will provide you with most of the applications you should need, inlcuding Gmail, Maps, Photo Gallery, Hangouts for texting, Drive for documents and many more. You will also have access to Google Play to be able to install new applications from the Internet.. Motorola don't add much to the system, leaving the personalisation of Android to you.

Alongside dual-SIM slots, there is 4G support and other standard connectivity options like Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS that provides real-time navigation and a microUSB 2.0 port to transfer files to and fro from your PC effortlessly. At the back, there is a Li-Ion 2470 mAh cell.. Bearing an attractive price tag, the Moto G third generation has enough firepower to compete with similar players like Xiaomi, Micromax, Asus, etc.. Please ask the question in above box. Does it have a hybrid SIM slot?. Two slots for SIMs (SIM 1 & SIM 2) and the 3rd slot for the microSD card. So, there is no need for the hybrid slot.. Moto G3 2015 has separate microSD slot that supports up to 32GB and two micro SIM slots; only one SIM works on the 4G network (SIM 1).. It has no hybrid SIM slot. It has two SIM slots and one microSD card slot. You can expand memory up to 32GB.. No, two SIM cards and a memory card can be used at the same time.. It has a dedicated memory card slot.. No, it does not have one. But, it has two (micro) SIM slots and a separate slot for a microSD card.. What is the difference between LTE and VOLTE?. The abbreviation of Long Term Evolution is LTE which is the 4G standard in telecommunications. When switching from 2G followed by 3G and 4G we always focus on the internet speeds, nobody cares about calling facilities. Either going through a 2G, 3G or 4G connection your calling requests pass through the same que which does not improve your calling experience. But in case of VoLTE it means Voice over LTE, where the calling request is being made on highest priority and the call data transmits through high speed data which enables you the enhanced mode of calling.. VoLTE is a HD voice calling Service over 4G LTE rather than 2G/3G network, currently we are using 2G/3G. Originally LTE was completely IP Cellular System for carrying data. If you are making a call from LTE Network, then the operators would be able to carry the voice either by reverting to 2G/3G technologies.. VoLTE is an HD voice calling Service over 4G LTE rather than 2G/3G network that we are using currently. Originally, LTE was completely IP Cellular System for carrying Data. If you are make a call from LTE Network, then the Operators would be able to carry the voice either by reverting to 2G/3G technologies..

If you are making a call from LTE network, the operators would be able to carry the voice either by reverting to 2G/3G technologies.. VoLTE is a HD voice calling Service over 4G LTE rather than 2G/3G network present we are using 2g-3G. Originally LTE was completely IP Cellular System for carrying Data.if you are making a call from LTE Network, the Operators would be able carry the voice either by reverting to 2G-3G technologies. Does it support 4G jio network and what is the difference between Moto G3 and Moto G turbo?. The difference between these two phones are that G turbo comes with additional turbo charging feature and it has the additional grade of water and dust resistance. But the battery capacity is lower compared to G3. I have using G3 since one and a half years now and it's flawless. But G4 battery is very poor as compared to G3. VoLTE is a HD voice calling service over 4G LTE rather than 2G/3G network present we are using 2G/3G. Originally LTE was completely IP Cellular System for carrying data. If you make a call from LTE Network, then the operators would be able to carry the voice either by reverting to 2G/3G technologies.. Yes, both phones support 4G networks. Moto G3 is powered by 1.4 Ghz processor Quadcore Adreno 306 with Water repellent coating. Whereas Moto G3 Turbo comes with turbo charging facility with 1.5 Ghz Octanecore processor Adreno 405 with Water repellent and dust coating.. Yes, it does support 4G network. The prime difference between G3 and G3 turbo is their charging timing. G3 turbo has a turbo charger therefore it can be charged soon as compared to G3.. Yes, Moto G3 supports Jio network. The difference between Moto G3 and Moto G turbo is that, the G3 has only one slot for 4G network and Moto G turbo have both slots for 4G network.. What is the difference between quadcore n octacore?. Cores are like hands to the processor. And quad means 4 where octa means 8. In case of quadcore, the CPU will deal with simultaneous 4 problems and octacore will be dealing with 8 simultaneous problems.. Just like One person has 4 hands its quad-core and if a person has 8 hands its octa-core. This is the power of a processor, quad-core have 4 cores and octa-core has 8 cores.. Octa-core vs Quad-core: It's not about power. The terms octa-core and quad-core denote the number of processor cores in a CPU. Octa is eight, and quad is four.. Octa-core vs Quad-core It's not about power. The terms octa-core and quad-core denote the number of processor cores in a CPU. It's about the performance of the phone. More the cores better are its functions in gaming and for another side by side apps.. Does it support 4G Jio network and what is the difference between Moto G3 and Moto E3 power?. My Moto G3 2015 updated to Marshmallow 6.0 supports Jio VoLTE. I have not used Moto G3 Power, whose model name suggests it as a 3G phone. Moto G3 is a fully functional 4G phone, One SIM is 4G and the 2nd SIM is 2G.. Yes, it supports Jio SIM in LTE. When the network is very poor, G3 shows no signal, but other VoLTE phones show 1 signal bar. But in E3 power, there is no network problem.. Yes it supports 4G and the major difference is in performance and camera. Moto G3 outbeats E3 power except in battery performance. Yes, it supports Jio 4G network & difference between both phones is their camera.. Motorola launched its Moto E3 Power last month. Motorola Moto G (3rd Gen) Video Review.
