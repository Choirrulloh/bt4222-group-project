It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 20.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 14 Jun 2017. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Samsung is well-established in the global smartphone market with its fine build quality. However, when it comes to the features of low or medium budget phones, Samsung is considered less generous compared to other well-known brands like Xiaomi, Oppo or Huawei. It is a fact that, the price of Samsung phones are higher comparing to its specs.. Samsung Galaxy J7 Max is a great exception from the above mentioned perspective. It is a medium priced smartphone but at the same time provides high and premium performance as well as great features. Galaxy J7 Max comes with 5.7 inch large full HD display with next generation PLS technology with better transparency and thus better viewing experience. The body is made of solid metal. 13 + 13 MP camera will capture with excellence. These so-called "social cameras" with instant share and edit features with live filters will let you post photos in Social channels like Facebook, Messenger or WhatsApp instantly. The performance is the most exciting thing in Samsung Galaxy J7 Max. 4GB RAM, 2.4 GHz octa-core CPU, Mali T880 GPU, Helio P20 Chipset and 4G network will deliver smooth experience while browsing the net, gaming, using any app or just touching around. Additional features like fingerprint and OTG makes J7 Max more worthy. One con or disadvantage is that there is no display protection such as Gorilla Glass.. User Rating: 3.05 ( 254 votes).

Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro, Galaxy J7 Max First Impressions. Ketan Pratap , 15 June 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Samsung Galaxy J7 Max has been launched at Rs. Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro price in India is Rs. Both come with Samsung's mobile payment solution. Samsung Galaxy J7 Max and Galaxy J7 Pro design Samsung Galaxy J7 Max and Galaxy J7 Pro specifications Samsung Pay and Samsung Pay Mini Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro, Galaxy J7 Max performance and cameras. At an event in New Delhi on Wednesday, Samsung unveiled the Galaxy J7 Pro and Galaxy J7 Max. The all-new J-series smartphones come with Samsung Pay and Samsung Pay Mini respectively, Samsung's payment solution that has been missing from the range so far. Apart from mobile payment solution, the Samsung Galaxy J7 Max and Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro also promise a premium design, features, specifications that can match flagship phones in some regards.. Samsung's J-series of smartphones have been well received in India, and have been catering to a broad price range. Smartphones like Galaxy J3 Pro , Galaxy J1 (4G) , and Galaxy J2 Pro have been targeted at sub-Rs. 10,000 segment while the Galaxy J7 Prime and Galaxy J5 (2016) have been focused on the Rs. The new Galaxy J7 Max and the Galaxy J7 Pro are being marketed as the devices to cater to "mass-mid segment smartphone market", which has lately seen fewer launches. At the New Delhi launch event, we got a chance to spend some time with the Galaxy J7 Max and Galaxy J7 Pro smartphones and here are our first impressions.. The new J-series phones sport all-metal unibody design and are sleek. The big displays certainly mean that it won't be easy to use the phones with just one hand, and we felt it during our limited time with the handsets. The Samsung Galaxy J7 Max and Galaxy J7 Pro measure 8.1mm and 7.8mm respectively.. The Galaxy J7 Max also comes with Smart Glow which is a squarish surrounding the rear camera at the back. The Smart Glow around the camera gives you alerts for notifications when they arrive.. For Galaxy J7 Pro, Samsung is promoting the flat back camera. We also liked the new "U" designed antenna bands on the Galaxy J7 Pro that definitely add to the visual appeal of the handset.. The new dual-SIM J-series phones also come with a dedicated slot for microSD card which could turn out to be a good addition at this price.. The Samsung Galaxy J7 Max features a 5.7-inch full-HD display and is powered by a MediaTek Helio P20 octa-core SoC clocked at 1.6GHz paired with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of inbuilt storage. The phone packs a 3300mAh non-removable battery and support 4G with VoLTE (with Cat. The Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro, on the other hand, features a 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED display, and is powered by an Exynos 7870 octa-core SoC clocked at 1.6GHz paired with 3GB of RAM. It offers 64GB of inbuilt storage that can be expanded using a microSD card (up to 128GB). The smartphone packs a 3600mAh battery and is IP54 certified for being splash proof.. Both phones sport 13-megapixel rear and front cameras with f/1.7 aperture and f/1.9 aperture respectively. There's flash support on both ends.. Both the Galaxy J7 Max and Galaxy J7 Pro ship with the company's new UX based on Android Nougat. We have to confess that Samsung has been constantly improving its UX since the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S6. There has been a cut down on number of pre-loaded apps, and interface looks neat. As seen in other Samsung phones, the Galaxy J7 Max and Galaxy J7 Pro come with Google and Microsoft suite of apps preinstalled.. Samsung has integrated a lot of Nougat features in its new UX like swiping up from the bottom opens up app drawer. We also noticed that both the phones came with a slider feature for directly jumping to Samsung Pay feature but there should be a way to turn it off. With Nougat, Samsung has also given its Settings page a revamp which now looks uncluttered.. One of the biggest features of the new J-series phones is Samsung Pay. The Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro will support the company's recently announced NFC-enabled mobile payment solution Samsung Pay. The South Korean company is also introducing its Samsung Pay Mini feature which can be seen as "lite" version of Samsung Pay. The new Galaxy J7 Max debuts the Samsung Pay Mini feature, which can be used to make online payments only. Sumit Walia, Director - Mobile Business, Samsung India while talking to Gadgets 360 said that the company was looking to bring its mobile payment solution to more devices for some time.. Explaining the new Samsung Pay Mini feature, Walia said that it comes with all the bells and whistles of Samsung Pay minus the "Tap & Pay" capability that is used to make offline payments at PoS terminals, as it's designed for phones like Samsung Galaxy J7 Max that don't come with the required hardware for the Pay service.. At the event, the company representatives showed how the Samsung Pay Mini feature worked and it looked neat and was easy to use. We will try the feature once we receive the Galaxy J7 Max.. Samsung Pay, on the other hand, supports both NFC and MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) that allows payment through smartphone via terminal's card reader. For new users, the Samsung Pay and Samsung Pay Mini apps come with inbuilt "How to use" videos, which is a good addition.. Samsung Pay Mini Launched in India: How's It Different From Samsung Pay?. In the limited time we spent, we noticed that the Galaxy J7 Max and Galaxy J7 Pro ran smoothly and we had no issues switching from one app to another. The smartphones were responsive to touch inputs as well. Stay tuned for our detailed reviews when we put the phones through their paces.. Samsung is also marketing the cameras on the Galaxy J7 Max and Galaxy J7 Pro as the best in the segment. In our short time with the devices, we found that both the devices came with cameras that were quick to launch and clicked sample shots that were crisp. The low-light photos, in particular, seemed to have decent amount of detail. The front-facing 13-megapixel cameras on both the devices with f/1.9 lens were also capable enough and captured photos with good amount of detail. Though, we will reserve our verdict on the cameras until we get a chance to test them under varied conditions.. Final thoughts Samsung's new Galaxy J7 Max and Galaxy J7 Pro smartphones no doubt pack some decent specifications under the hood. The Samsung Pay addition makes the phones quiet capable too. The camera is also impressive on both the Galaxy J7 Max and Galaxy J7 Pro, and we will have more on them when we get to review the devices.. The Samsung Galaxy J7 Max and Galaxy J7 Pro have been launched in India at Rs. They will be going on sale via offline channels as well as the company's online store. At this price point, both the new devices will be competing against popular devices like Xiaomi Mi Max Prime , Moto G5 Plus , and Honor 8 Lite ..

Samsung Galaxy J7 Max is currently available at the best price of: ₹16,000. As a reviewer, I've stood witness to Samsung's evolution in the smartphone market. From low-end devices like the Galaxy Y to the class-leading Galaxy S8, Samsung has done a lot. It's rise to a market leading position came somewhat easily, but remaining there has proved to be quite difficult. Believe it or not, a large number of consumers trust Samsung, even after the Note 7 debacle. But while devices like the Galaxy S8 and Note series may make sense overseas, India is a different monster altogether, and the Galaxy J series is arguably more important, including the Samsung Galaxy J7 Max .. In a lot of ways, the Galaxy J7 Max is the epitomy of Samsung's evolution, while retaining some of the things the company isn't liked for. It doesn't bring you class-leading specifications, but it's evidently a result of extensive market research. It will do best in retail stores, where you touch and feel the device, you take it for a short spin even, and make your decision on the spot. And if you indeed do that, the Galaxy J7 Max would convince you against many other devices. Of course, that doesn't meant Samsung isn't selling the Galaxy J7 Max online , which is probably why you're reading this review.. As mentioned above, Samsung is playing the consumer's emotion here. The J7 Max is about how the phone feels, rather than what it is on paper. To that end, it has a unibody metallic design, rounded near the corners, but more or less slab-like. It "feels" premium, more so than the Moto G5 Plus, it's chief competitor. It's built solidly with no creaks or crevices to speak of. As far as the sub-20k market is concerned, the Galaxy J7 Max is up to industry standards today.. On the other hand, it has a large footprint and is meant for big phone lovers. You will also need large pockets to carry it around, while your grip will have to shift often when using the phone with one hand. From a build and design purview, the Samsung Galaxy J7 Max is no better than the best in this range, but no worse either. I personally find the looks plain, which isn't necessarily bad.. The power button is on the left and falls below your thumb, as long you have medium to large hands. You will be shifting your grip to reach the volume rocket, that lies on the upper half of the right. The phone is slightly curved near the rear edges, with stylised plastic strips on the top and bottom. Samsung's oval fingerprint sensor-cum home button is on the front, with touch-based back and recents keys on either side.. The slightly more expensive Galaxy J7 Pro has an AMOLED display panel, which makes one wonder why Samsung couldn't do the same on the J7 Max. That said, the company is using one of its other technologies for the 5.7 inch panel on this device. It's a TFT display, using Samsung's PLS technology.. Plane-Line Switching (PLS) follows almost the same principles as IPS panels, which allows Samsung to avoid the viewing angle issues commonly associated with TFT displays. Black levels are up to IPS standards, although they're far behind AMOLED panels. The Galaxy J7 Max's display looks very slightly washed out, with decent colour saturation and black levels. The glass feels premium to touch, but you could indeed get a much better display, on phones like the Moto G5 Plus, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and many others.. Also, I faced some touch issues with the Galaxy J7 Max, similar to what we noticed on the Galaxy A5 earlier. The phone sometimes doesn't respond to touches, requiring you to tap an app/button repeatedly. While the display isn't the J7 Max's strong suit, it's actually better than every TFT panel I've tested recently.. Spec-to-spec the Galaxy J7 Max would fall behind almost every phone in this price range. But even so, it has a huge advantage over phones produced by Xiaomi, Huawei, Lenovo and almost all others, barring Motorola. The Galaxy J7 Max runs on Android Nougat out-of-the-box, and is one of the few phones in this price, that runs on Nougat. Samsung's history with updates on its budget devices isn't great, but by the looks of it, no one in this price range is interested in giving consumers an up to date operating system. The fact that the Galaxy J7 Max at least runs on Nougat makes it more trustworthy than any phone, except the Moto G5 Plus.. The Galaxy J7 Max also has the same UI as on the Galaxy S8, minus the capacitive navigation keys and edge functions of course. The UI looks and feels good and premium, but it has a sluggish feel to it. That's possibly because of a weaker chipset than the Snapdragon 625, and one does wish Samsung could have done better here.. The Galaxy J7 Max also has Samsung Pay Mini, a stripped down version of Samsung Pay, running on the Galaxy A and S series. You can link your PayTM and UPI accounts to this, and make payments at places that support the same. Samsung Pay still has a ways to go before it's adopted in India, but it's good to see Samsung provide such a service in its cheaper phones.. The social camera feature gives you access to some filters and allows instant sharing via Facebook and WhatsApp. It's a gimmick that some may like, but truthfully, don't we have enough filters everywhere already?. For me, the Samsung Galaxy J7 Max's downfall is thanks to the MediaTek Helio P20. The chipset is simply not powerful enough to take on the Snapdragon 625 or its more powerful counterparts. The Galaxy J7 Max is a slow phone and it doesn’t feel as snappy as phones today should. 18,000, you should be able buy something faster.. App load times are high and the phone doesn’t feel responsive enough on regular usage. Apps like Facebook, Twitter and many others feel slow. Games run at playable frame rates, but in-game menus and loading times will be higher than reasonable. Games like Injustice 2 are frustrating because of how often you have to wait at a loading screen.. While there are no heating issues on the device, you don’t expect excessive heating on such performance any way. The Galaxy J7 Max is an Android phone after all, so you can expect it to keep getting slower over time.. If performance is its downfall, the camera is where the Galaxy J7 Max redeems itself. It’s got a 13MP rear camera on the back and f/1.7 aperture. The UI remains the same as other Samsung phones running on Nougat, and image quality is amongst the best in this price range.. The Galaxy J7 Max takes great photos regardless of how the light conditions are. White balance is good for the most part, and the Galaxy J7 Max produces well detailed photos as well. You see shades of Samsung’s low light algorithms (from the Galaxy S8 ) here, with brighter than usual photos under low light.. Comparing to the Moto G5 Plus (our top camera in this price range), the Galaxy J7 Max fares very well. It’s actually better in low light at times, producing slightly brighter photos. The two phones are mostly at par in most other cases. The Moto G5 Plus ( review ) tends to produce slightly warmer photos, whereas the Galaxy J7 Max is more towards the cooler side.. 100% crop: Samsung Galaxy J7 Max (Left) vs Moto G5 Plus (Right). Low Light: Samsung Galaxy J7 Max (Left) vs Moto G5 Plus (Right). The Galaxy J7 Max has issues focusing on subjects when they’re too close to the camera, so the Moto G5 Plus is often the pick for this. But other than that, the two cameras are essentially of the same quality. They even have some of the same issues, with slow focus speeds in low light. The Galaxy J7 Max is the faster one at processing though. It’s also better at video stabilisation than the G5 Plus.. Samsung Galaxy J7 Max Camera Samples. Given the phone’s large footprint, a 3300 mAh battery seems little by today’s standards. Our regular battery test wasn’t compatible with this device, but regular usage tests suggest that the phone will easily last a full work-day. I could stream HD video on the J7 Max for over 7 hours at a time, while gaming didn’t drain the battery very easily either. You can expect 14-16 hours worth of battery life from the Galaxy J7 Max.. How it stacks up against competition. The Moto G5 Plus is indeed the chief competitor for the Samsung Galaxy J7 Max, and compared to that device, the phone is indeed inferior. While the two phones have similar cameras, the Moto phone is faster, has a smoother stock Android Nougat software and better display.. The Galaxy J7 Max has a better camera than most other smartphones in this range, but the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 ( review ), Coolpad Cool 1 ( review ) and Honor 6X ( review ) are considerably faster than this device. That leads us to the conclusion for this review.. There are two reasons to buy the Galaxy J7 Max — a great camera and Android Nougat. Unfortunately for Samsung, those are also the reasons for purchasing the Moto G5 Plus. Motorola’s phone is also faster and a few thousand bucks cheaper. So, while the Moto G5 Plus is indeed the best buy in this price range, the Samsung Galaxy J7 Max is worth considering if updated software and a great camera are your priorities..

Priced slightly on the higher side. Samsung launched the Galaxy J7 Pro and Galaxy J7 Max smartphones in India last month. The Galaxy J7 Max was the first phone in the series to go on sale in the country. first Samsung smartphone from Samsung to come with Samsung Pay Mini and is also the first mid-range phone from the company to come with 4GB of RAM and MediaTek Helio P20 SoC. Is the smartphone worth the price? Let us find out in the complete review.. We unboxed the smartphone recently, check out the video below.. The Samsung Galaxy J7 has the same curved design as most other latest smartphones from the company. It has a 5.7-inch IPS 2.5d curved glass display with a pixel resolution of 1920 x 1080 and a pixel density of around 386 PPI. The display is bright, has good viewing angles, offers vibrant color output and the sunlight visibility is also good. Even though this doesn’t have an AMOLED panel like the J7 Pro, it is good. Samsung doesn’t say if the display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass or any other hardened glass, so it is safe to get a case. The display is not glossy and doesn’t attract fingerprint easily.. The phone has about 72% screen-to-body ratio and slim bezels on the sides, yet it is huge for single-handed usage since it has a 5.7-inch screen. It is also a bit heavy at 179 grams, even though it packs only 3300mAh battery.. Above the display there is an earpiece. On the left, there is a 13-megapixel camera with f/1.9 aperture and the usual set of proximity and ambient light sensors on the right side.

There is also a Smart Glow light around the camera that was first introduced with the Galaxy J2 (2016) last year..

You can also share these images with WhatsApp and Facebook easily using Instant Share option.. Settings option lets you choose resolution, toggle location tag, option to quickly launch the camera by pressing Home key twice, use the volume keys to take pictures and more.. Coming to the image quality, daylight shot and macro shots are good. HDR shots are good as well. Low-light shots are good as well, thanks to the f/1.7 aperture sensor, but it could have been better. Images with flash are good as well since the single LED flash is not overpowering even in macro shots. The front-facing camera is good for selfies and the details are crisp. Selfie flash is useful in low lighting conditions. It is also good for video chats.. Check out some samples below (Click the image to view full resolution sample.).. It can record videos at 1080p full HD resolution at 30 fps. Video quality is good, but the phone doesn’t have a secondary microphone so audio is not crisp.

On the top of Nougat, it has Samsung Experience version 8.1, which is the company’s new UX that is more refined compared to its TouchWiz UX..

You can add up to 3 fingerprints. It can also be used for Samsung Pay Mini.. It doesn’t have a dedicated music player, so you have to rely on Google Play Music. It has equalizer, Surround and Tube Amp sound effects that can be enabled from the settings. All these improve the audio when listening through earphones. That said, audio through the bundled or third-party earphones is decent, but the loudspeaker output is not the best. Since the loudspeaker is present on the sides, sound doesn’t get muffled when you place the phone on a flat surface, but the sound it not brilliant either. The FM Radio has a new UI.

At a price tag of Rs. 17,900, the Galaxy J7 Max is a bit costly compared to other phones in Samsung’s mid-range ‘J series’ phones and even one of the direct competitors – Moto G5 Plus. This time Samsung has decided go with MediaTek Helio P20 Octa-Core SoC instead of its own 14nm Exynos 7 Octa 7870 or Snapdragon 625 SoC that are power efficient, but the real-life performance is good.. It also doesn’t have an AMOLED display like the J7 Pro. Even though there is Smart Glow light, it doesn’t compensate fully for the lack of notification LED and the phone doesn’t have support for fast charging when most phones these days come with fast charging. The main selling point of the phone is Samsung Pay Mini and Social Camera features. Even though Samsung Pay Mini is a good addition, Social Camera features are already available in Snapchat, Instagram and other social apps.. The Galaxy J7 Max is available from Flipkart as well are retail stores offline, but Samsung has launched the Galaxy On Max for Rs. 16,900 without the Glow light and similar specifications that is available on Flipkart.
