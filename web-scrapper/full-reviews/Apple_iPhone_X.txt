It seems like yesterday when Steve Jobs was on stage introducing the first edition of the Apple iPhone. A decade has passed and sadly so has Steve, but his legacy continues. Apple launched the iPhone X on November 3 globally and for the first time simultaneously in India. Both Hollywood and Bollywood actors have gone gaga over this smartphone. Apple iPhone X (Ten as the company calls it) came to our test bench for assessment and this is our review of the most talked about smartphone. iPhone X Display and Design Coming from large handheld devices such as Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and Apple iPhone 8 Plus, when we first held the iPhone X it seemed a bit small. But few minutes with the phone you realise that the screen is larger than the iPhone 8 plus (5.5-inches). Apple iPhone X has Super Retina HD OLED display (HDR ready) measuring 5.8-inches, but the overall size of the phone is smaller because it is almost bezel-less. So, while it has a larger screen than its brother, it is great to work, with just one hand. The contrast ratio of this mobile is 1,000,000:1 and supports a resolution of 2,436x1,125 pixels. We absolutely loved the display of the iPhone X, it makes everything look vibrant. Personally, we favoured it over the iPhone 8 Plus. We played lot of games and YouTube Videos on it and we were not once disappointed. Apple iPhone X User Reviews & Rating.

The iPhone X sets the stage for Apple's next decade, with a sharp new design and a future focus on augmented reality. The Rent Is Too Darn High. Should You Buy the iPhone X?. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus. PCMag reviews products independently , but we may earn affiliate commissions from buying links on this page.. View All 9 Photos in Gallery. Apps need to be reprogrammed to take advantage of display. The iPhone X sets the stage for Apple's next decade, with a sharp new design and a future focus on augmented reality.. Maybe X isn't quite right: This should be the iPhone Beta. The new iPhone X sets the stage for a new decade of full-screen, augmented reality living. Like the best Apple products, it dares to question old assumptions, break rules, and introduce radical new concepts. But also like some groundbreaking Apple products — the original iPod, the original iPhone, and the original iMac among them — it makes me feel a little bit like I'm a beta tester for the future, and like app developers, especially, need to catch up before this is a completely comfortable phone to use.. You're coming here to find out if you should buy the iPhone X. As of this writing, too many apps aren't ready for it right now, and other features feel not quite fully baked. You need to have the early adopter mentality to enjoy the X completely. Unlike the iPhone 8 , this isn't boring. Get ready to be excited by an iPhone again.. Apple tends to redesign the iPhone every few years. The original models' stone-like appearance gave way to the iPhone 4 's glass sandwich, which became the iPhone 6 's metal sleekness. The iPhone X is nearly bezel-less, as advertised, with that notorious notch for the front camera assembly eating a chunk out of the screen at the top. It comes in space gray or silver. On the back, the dual cameras create a sharp, not smooth, bump that you should even out with a nice case. Apple says that the glass back is durable, but we strongly suggest getting a case for any $1,000 phone, no matter how strong it is.. The all-screen design would feel radical if we hadn't seen the Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8 , LG V30 , and the like. It does make the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus look pretty bad, though, like they have quite a bit of wasted space.. View All 9 Photos in Gallery. At 5.65 by 2.79 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and 6.14 ounces, the X is slightly shorter, wider, and heavier than Samsung's Galaxy S8. More importantly for iFans, it's slightly bigger than the iPhone 6/7/8, but not nearly as big or as wide as the Plus series. I love this: You get a lot more screen, and a lot more usage, in a comfortable one-handed form factor. I don't want to go back to any other iPhone after this. Note that the keyboard is a little narrower than the Plus' keyboard. If you have very big fingers and need the largest possible keyboard, you still have to go with the Plus.. The X's 2,436-by-1,125-pixel, 5.8-inch, 458ppi AMOLED screen actually has less surface area than the iPhone 8 Plus' 5.5-inch screen, because it's a very different shape. It's a tall, narrow screen, at a 19.5:9 aspect ratio; that's narrower than the Galaxy S8 (18.5:9), and much narrower than previous iPhones (16:9). Using SQUID , our handy measure of sheer display size, you're getting 12.36 square inches of display here, as compared with 9.44 on the iPhone 8 and 12.93 on the iPhone 8 Plus .. The OLED is very carefully color balanced to look as much like Apple's previous LCDs as possible, but it just barely betrays its true nature: blacks are blacker, and colors are just a touch more saturated than on the iPhone 8 Plus. The phone supports both popular versions of HDR , HDR10 and Dolby Vision, and will show compatible content in HDR when appropriate. Compared with a Galaxy S8, the iPhone X's colors are noticeably warmer, with whites tending a little bit more toward yellow than the bluish Galaxy.. I blasted two bright LED lights directly at the iPhone X, and the screen was still perfectly readable, with wide viewing angles. Outdoors, it looks positively gorgeous, with Apple's lamination bringing the image right to the front of the screen, with perfectly tuned colors for natural light, and little reflectivity. Display expert Ray Soneira at DisplayMate Labs agrees. His report on the iPhone X says it has the most accurate colors he's even seen, with the lowest reflectivity in ambient light. He also puzzled out the X's brightness: While the Note 8 can beat it in limited lab test scenarios, the iPhone X is the brightest OLED smartphone display in standard lighting, with the kinds of images on the screen that most people use.. Like on the iPhone 7 series, there's no headphone jack.. Yes, the home button is gone. No, it isn't a big deal, navigation-wise. You flick up from the bottom of the screen to go home. Flicking up and to the right shows you your most recent apps as cards, which you can scroll through to pick the one you want to open. You adapt to this very quickly.. But the lack of a home button creates one big problem: third-party apps look like a mess. It turns out the notch at the top of the display is less of a problem than the area at the bottom, where apps like Citymapper and SmartNews have their content collide with the horizontal bar that indicates you're supposed to flick up to go home. Other apps, like the popular game Riptide GP Renegades, just intensely letterbox their content to 16:9, losing the advantage of the bigger display.. Netflix, Twitter, and YouTube show how it's supposed to be done. They're all aware of the notch and the menu bar. YouTube and Netflix both show mostly 16:9 videos; you can zoom them if you want, to take over the full screen, but then it crops off the top of the frame. In zoomed mode, the notch also occludes part of the video, but that's by design. I'm hoping that app developers end up using the area around the notch for controls and status bar content.. Left to right: iPhone 8, iPhone X, iPhone 8 Plus. Through my testing, I found a bunch of less visible but more disturbing third-party app problems, too. Some Wi-Fi-testing apps would just quit on the X, where they ran fine on an 8 Plus with the same OS version. Others gave inconsistent results, which is a deeper problem: how do you know where the truth is? I've heard that even apps that don't look like they need to be reformatted, still need to be recompiled to run properly on the X.. It's going to take a few months for app developers to reformat and recompile their apps. If you're buying this phone in 2017, you need to check to see when your apps were updated, and you're going to feel like a beta tester. For many of the kind of people who read PCMag.com, that's fine. But people who want a seamless, finished experience should wait until 2018 before buying.. Like the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, the X uses the Apple A11 Bionic processor. The all-new processor has six cores in a big-little design, with two high-performance cores and four efficiency cores, as well as a new GPU designed by Apple. The iPhone X benchmarked similarly to the iPhone 8, as expected, although in general it scored even a little better. It's the fastest phone we've ever tested.. The A11's GPU is massively overpowered for the screen resolution, but there's a reason for it: the GPU (and Apple's new "neural processing unit") has to crunch all of that face data coming through the front camera.. See How We Test Cell Phones. Apple says that the X has the same LTE, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth capabilities as the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. That means there are three different models of the X: a Qualcomm one, which works on all four US networks; an Intel one, which works on AT&T and T-Mobile; and a Japanese one that Americans will never see. The Qualcomm one is sold by Sprint, Verizon, and as the universal unlocked model at Apple stores.. With a month of iPhone 8 use now past, we looked at Ookla's Speedtest Intelligence database for an update on whether the Qualcomm model still looks better than the Intel one. (Note: Ookla is owned by Ziff Davis, PCMag.com's parent company.) On AT&T, Qualcomm iPhone 8 and 8 Plus units are averaging about 32.9Mbps down, while Intel units average about 26.8Mbps. On T-Mobile, Qualcomm units average around 37.1Mbps down, while Intel units average around 34.8Mbps. It's not a huge differential, but it's noticeable and consistent. If you have the option, get the Qualcomm model, by purchasing an unlocked, carrier-free phone from the Apple Store and putting your own SIM in it.. Neither unit quite measured up to the Samsung Galaxy S8 when we were using them side by side; the S8 has 4x4 MIMO antennas to capture better signal on non-Sprint networks, signal-boosting HPUE on Sprint, and a gigabit modem. (The iPhone is only configured for 600Mbps in the US.) But if you smooth out the results over all the thousands of tests in the Ookla Speedtest Intelligence database taken across the US in a wide range of signal conditions, the differences are much less noticeable. On Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile, LTE tests with Galaxy S8 models in October had just about the same download speeds as LTE tests with iPhone 8 devices. (The Galaxy S8s on AT&T were faster, at 42.6Mbps down, than iPhones were, at 32.9Mbps down; we're not sure why.). In terms of frequency bands, the phones have all of the US bands except T-Mobile's new 600MHz Band 71, which it is starting to use to expand coverage in rural areas. That's so far only on the LG V30. Expect it to appear in next year's iPhones.. Call quality is very good; I'd especially like to call out the blaring speakerphone, which is noticeably louder than the iPhone 7's speakerphone and quite usable outdoors. Background noise cancellation through the handset mic is very good, and it supports HD Voice, VoLTE, and other modern voice standards. Apple had problems with its voice quality a few years ago, but it doesn't any more.. A teardown by IHS Markit shows the iPhone X using the exact same Murata Wi-Fi/Bluetooth module as the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which means it should have the same performance. The phone supports dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi, just like iPhones for the past three years have, and if you don't have a router with 5GHz 802.11ac support, you should get one for the best performance.. That said, all of our signal and speed measurement apps have been acting odd on the iPhone X. In weak Wi-Fi signal conditions, we see lower RSSI signal strength and slower speeds on the iPhone X than on the iPhone 8 Plus. Apple said that many apps need to be updated for the iPhone X, and that the hardware should perform on par with the 8. We'll continue to look into this further.. Our initial battery test of the iPhone X was disappointing; with its 2,716mAh battery, we got 4 hours, 56 minutes of LTE video streaming time with the screen on full brightness, as compared with 6 hours, 25 minutes on the iPhone 8 and 5 hours, 13 minutes on the iPhone 8 Plus. We will retest that a few times to see if connectivity issues may have caused the shorter result.. Like the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, the X supports Qi wireless charging (a new feature for iPhones), and also charges traditionally through its Lightning jack. For now, it doesn't have wireless fast charging, although Apple promises that will come with future software updates and wireless charging pads. Check out our analysis of various quick-charging adapters for the iPhone 8, which also applies to the iPhone X.. The iPhone X has very similar main cameras to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. They have one different spec that doesn't matter, and one that does. The supposed wider aperture of the X's 2x camera didn't create different images in our low-light tests. As we show in our iPhone 8 camera comparison and our Google Pixel 2 XL review, the difference between the iPhone, Galaxy S8/Note 8, and Pixel 2 XL at this point is basically bragging rights. On the other hand, adding OIS to the 2x zoom camera made a huge difference when recording 4K videos using the 2x zoom lens. In 4K mode, it was very difficult to keep our iPhone 8 Plus steady at 2x — jitter abounded. But videos taken with the iPhone X at the same time, in the same place, were much smoother. I remember the same effect happening with the 1x camera in the iPhone 6s Plus, which was the first iPhone to introduce optical image stabilization (OIS). If you're a serious iPhone videographer, and many people are, that's a slam-dunk reason to get the X.. One interesting note: The OIS, oddly, doesn't improve low-light quality in still images taken at 2x zoom. That's because in low light, Apple still chooses to take 2x pictures by using digital zoom on the 1x lens. That's a software choice, and I'm curious to see if Apple will tweak that in the future.. The front-facing 7-megapixel camera is the iPhone X's most radical advancement. It uses a "dot projector" to throw invisible dots onto any object in front of it, and then uses an IR camera to map those dots, producing a live, 3D map of objects in space. Apple frames it as mostly for selfies, but this is also how to do augmented reality right; Qualcomm demonstrated a similar three-camera Spectra image module recently, which it said will come to Android phones in 2018. We suspect this 3D-mapping technology will come to the rear camera on the iPhone XI.. For now, the 3D camera starts with Face ID, which uses the 3D map to unlock the phone when it sees your face (the phone has no fingerprint scanner). Your face data is stored securely on the phone, and according to Apple is never uploaded to the cloud. You can use Face ID anywhere you would use Touch ID, including for Apple Pay purchases.. I tried Face ID in various lighting and it worked almost all of the time. You will still have to enter your passcode, more often than you did in the Touch ID world. For instance, if you're passing your phone around, it's locked, and as other people start to unlock it, it'll scan their faces —if it uses up its five valid attempts at face unlocking, you then have to enter your passcode. You can also temporarily disable Face ID, and force the passcode, by squeezing two buttons on the side of the phone.. Face ID is faster than it looks. While the animation of a little lock opening is quite slow, you can swipe up to use the phone before the animation completes. An "attention mode" setting demands that your eyes be open, so people can't unlock the phone on your sleeping face, but it also demands that you stare directly at the phone from arm's distance. Turning off attention mode makes it easier to unlock the phone at an angle on a table, but it's not for the paranoid.. The system works through glasses, but not mirrored sunglasses. You can only enroll one face, and it can't be a child under about age 13. Everyone else will have to use passcodes. It can't be fooled by photos or models of your face, but it can be fooled by identical twins.. After a few days, you kind of forget it's there. You pick up the phone, it wakes up, and you swipe up to unlock it. That said, I wish there was still a fingerprint scanner option, and I wish it could unlock straight to the home screen, without requiring the extra swipe.. It must be frustrating to Google when it works on something for years, putting out a string of products that don't take off, and then Apple goes ahead and makes it mainstream in one fell swoop. The iPhone X is the first mainstream augmented reality phone, although it's only a peek into the AR future.. The single-camera AR that Apple and Google are pushing right now is not great. Because of its unified API and huge install base, Apple's ARKit is going to become much more widespread than Google's ARCore, very quickly. But while it's fun, ARKit can only detect flat horizontal surfaces, and not really map things to walls, furniture, and people.. The iPhone X's front camera shows another level of AR, which is like motion capture in films. Using the infrared dot projector, it can turn you into Apple's animoji or put Snapchat-like masks on your face.. Animoji are a set of 12 creatures — animals, a robot, an alien, and a poop —that imitate your facial expressions for a 10-second video clip. You create them in Messages, and you can send them to anyone; Android phone users get them as video clips. They're also, I think, a teaser. Apple is putting an API out for third parties to create animoji -like functionality, so we should expect other motion-capture characters to appear on the iPhone.. This is exciting; it's also scary. Expect to see games like The Sims offer an option for characters with your very own face, and for big-name sticker packs to appear with popular licensed characters you can operate. The AR camera also lets the iPhone X take "portrait mode" bokeh selfies, by integrating depth information to blur out the background. It works well, although I still think that Apple's "stage lighting" feature (which tries to black out the background entirely) is too gimmicky and frequently distorts the edges of your head.. But the X stops short of true AR, which is what you get with the Microsoft HoloLens headset: the ability to seamlessly merge virtual and actual reality. I think the A11 processor has the power to do this, coupled with the phone's dual cameras, and that Apple is holding this back to keep ARKit compatible with single-camera phones like the iPhone 7 and 8. We may have to wait for the iPhone XI to see that really happen.. The iPhone comes in 64GB ($999) and 256GB ($1,149) models. No matter how exciting it is, I don't believe any phone is worth the $999 to $1,149 Apple is selling it for. This isn't just an Apple problem; a $900-plus price also caused me to hesitate over the otherwise excellent Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Americans are being squeezed right now by steadily increasing mandatory costs: health care, education, and housing. They don't need their smartphones to become $200 more expensive as well. There are ways around this, but you need to be prepared for them. If you're the kind of person who is good at selling phones on eBay, more power to you. Otherwise, the smartest option for the iPhone X, in my mind, is to find an old-school subsidized contract, or go with a quick-upgrade leasing program like T-Mobile's Jump! On Demand or Sprint's Flex Lease. That gets you paying $500 for the phone over a year, and next year you can stick with it or trade it in for a newer phone, depending on what Apple comes out with next.. I understand why Apple is charging so much for this phone. Various press reports have said that the front-facing AR camera is extremely expensive to make because of low product yields , and that Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the OLED screens.. But I'm also kicked back to the days of the first, groundbreaking 8GB iPhone, which launched at $599. It got cut to $399 a few months later. The same isn't going to happen here, but it's an acknowledgment that being this cutting-edge is just too expensive for many people.. Next year's iPhone XI may also be less expensive, as Apple figures out its front-facing camera production issues, potentially switches entirely to cheaper Intel modems, and new OLED screen manufacturing plants come on line.. The iPhones we are recommending to most people this year are the $549 iPhone 7 and the $649 iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone X is for early adopters, people who want a glimpse into Apple's unfinished future, and who are willing to take on a few bumps in the road (such as poorly designed third-party apps, for a while) to get there. Yes, it's the best iPhone, hands down. It's also a thousand flippin' dollars.. Part of my hesitation here is that I think the iPhone X promises an iPhone XI that is going to be absolutely thundering: amazing AR capabilities, possibly a fingerprint sensor under the screen, definitely better Face ID, a gigabit modem, and all that, possibly at a lower cost.. For now, the iPhone X looks great. And it's going to grow, in terms of capabilities, once software developers figure their apps out. It's more iPhone than you probably need, but it shows that Apple is still innovating.. Bottom Line: The iPhone X sets the stage for Apple's next decade, with a sharp new design and a future focus on augmented reality..

For the price of $1150 apple is ripping its customers off because it only costs them around $300 to produce it! The design isn't that great with a glass back bound to be broken and a huge ugly notch at the top. The specs are subpar for devices price and thats why it deservers this rating. This review should be valued far more than the other ones here because it actually gives an explanation.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 2 out of 3 people found this review helpful.

High screen-to-body ratio (82.35 %). Lacks microSD slot for storage expansion. Marking the iPhone's 10th anniversary, the iPhone X is easily the most advanced iPhone yet. Its stand-out design feature is the HDR-capable OLED display strethcing from edge to edge, while the back is made of glass instead of metal to allow wireless charging. Instead of a traditional fingerprint scanner, the iPhone X uses Face ID facial recognition, while navigation gestures compensate for the lack of a home button. The dual camera at the back allows for 2X optical zoom, and Portrait mode with studio lighting effects is available both when taking selfies and regular photos. iOS 11 runs on it out of the box, introducing augmented reality applications, a redesigned App Store, a new Control Center layout, and a number of UI refinements..

Everyone reading this is probably familiar with the Apple phone line up so I am going to focus on the differences between the iPhone X and iPhone 7 plus specifically. First off, the set-up process has been significantly streamlined. When setting up your new iPhone X setup will ask you if your old iPhone is nearby, select yes, and you can wireless transfer all your apps, settings, backgrounds, passwords, etc. to your new phone in a few clicks. I really appreciated this streamlined process and it was incredibly quick and easy to transfer all my settings to my new iPhone X. The other main features that have been upgraded are as follows: New screen (5.8” OLED is the most vibrant and clear screen ever produced by Apple) - Apple has removed the touch ID sensor and bezel around the old iPhone screen which means the iPhone X has a noticeably smaller footprint while maintaining a larger screen size than the iPhone 7/8 Plus. (See comparison images attached of the iPhone X versus iPhone 7 Plus). - OLED Screen offers deeper blacks and brighter whites resulting in greater color reproduction. - Similar to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus the iPhone X uses true tone technology to mimic the lighting conditions around it and adjust the white balance accordingly. - The notch cut out of the top of the screen is where Apple has included the face recognition sensors, front camera, and a host of other sensors. I thought this would be annoying but Apple has cleverly used the screen real estate on both sides to include the time, date, battery indicators, etc. Farewell Touch-ID, Hello Face-ID - Face-ID is Apples new facial recognition technology which has replaced the finger printer reader and home button in order to free up additional screen real-estate. This is new and only available on the iPhone X. - Apples facial recognition is light years ahead of Samsung or any other carrier. I have tested this flawlessly with glasses, a hat, and even in the dark. It is as simple as looking at your phone and swiping up from the bottom. - I was worried this feature would be inconsistent or frustrating but it has worked really well. The only time it is a bit more inconvenient is if the phone is sitting on your desk or a flat surface you kind of have to lean over a bit or angle the phone towards you to unlock it. - This super powerful new camera also enables the animoji features which maps your facial expressions to create a talking emoji. This is a fun feature but more a novelty than anything. - This same true-depth camera makes the iPhone X the ultimate phone for taking selfies. The new portrait mode allows the user blur the background, or even cut yourself out entirely and place yourself on a black background. Additional noteworthy features and changes: - The rear camera boasts a dual 12MP sensor array with improved aperture and wide angle lens with image stabilization. The increased aperture from 2.8 to 2.4 allows for better images in low light conditions. - Video capabilities have also approved as well to include 60p 4k video recording delivering clear, fluid images. - Increased audio quality and volume - Increased RAM size to 3GB and new Bionic Chip makes the iPhone X one of the most powerful smartphones are the market. - Updated design features glass back and sides which make the phone beautiful looking. A very welcome change in the normal design. - Battery life: The iPhone X boasts the largest battery in Apple history with a 2716 mAh battery which is a bit larger than the new iPhone 8 Plus. A full charge from 0-100% takes about 2 hours and 10 minutes in my testing. - In addition, wireless charging has finally been added to the new iPhone X, and 8 series phones. I have not tested this out but am excited to give it a try (Wireless charging pad is not included with the phone). Bottom line, the iPhone X is another smash hit from Apple. Every feature people were concerned about turned out to work flawlessly as usual. I have only had the iPhone for about 24 hours so it is early to leave a long-term focused review but so far the new iPhone X has lived up to the hype. The iPhone X may not revolutionize the smart phone industry but it is a welcome upgrade to the iPhone which designs were getting a bit dated. I am excited about Apples new strategy to release a flagship model and allow the new features to trickle down to next generation’s phones. If you have the money to spare you won’t likely be disappointed. My only complaint is the phone only comes in 64GB or 256GB basically forcing users to pay an extra $150 to get decent storage. Further, the beautiful glass back on the screen feels fantastic and has a great weight to it. However, a replacement screen will cost you $275+ and the back glass replacement is rumored to cost around $400. Essentially a single drop could result in a $700 repair bill. Unfortunately this means most phones will be shielded in a case and will not be enjoyed. Read less ***Note Carrier Compatibility: All carrier variant iPhone X in the world are carrier unlocked.

The iPhone arrived with a non-functional power slot in it. It didn't even come close to fitting the power tip and appeared to be missing all electronic connections. This made the iPhone useless since it couldn't be charged. It was especially devastating since we live in a remote area where we cannot get an iPhone elsewhere and had waited nearly 3 weeks for this to arrive.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 2 Face ID and iOS 11. by Rado Slavov. T-Mobile - T-Mobile + AT&T - AT&T + Verizon - Verizon + Sprint - Sprint + iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple +. 2 Face ID and iOS 11. 4 Battery life and Conclusion. Design and Notch Great fit and finish, but the notch is weird, and not in a good way. The biggest thing going for this phone is obviously its bezel-less design – the 5.8" display of the iPhone X reaches from one end, all the way to the other; it covers the entire front, with just a thin, continuous frame circling around it. If we could put the full stop here and call it a day, it'd have been a quick and easy win for the iPhone X. Unfortunately, we're just 15 minutes into the movie, and you just know something bad is about to happen; something that will allow the plot to develop further. As we circle around the display, we inevitably reach the top edge, where we meet this year's antagonist: the so-called 'notch'. Sitting up there, biting into the top edge of the screen, the iPhone X's notch is both a blessing and a curse. How come a blessing? With an all-screen design, there's obviously no space left for the trusty Touch ID fingerprint home button. How do we unlock the iPhone X securely, then? Located in this pitch-black space within the iPhone X notch are all the camera and sensor components required for a new type of biometric authentication on smartphones: 3D face recognition! More on that – later, but all in all, that's why the notch is there, forever ruining the seamless look of the iPhone X. The notch is a unique visual element that makes the iPhone X unmistakable, unlike many current and future bezel-less smartphones, which will have very little to differentiate themselves with. This, along with enabling Face ID, are the only positive things we can say about the notch. Toss them aside, and all we're left with is one huge compromise. The notch doesn't look good, it ruins what could have been a striking, forward-looking smartphone. If the notch wasn't there, the iPhone X would have been the apotheosis of smartphone design. But it's there, and you'll be constantly reminded of its presence throughout your daily interactions with the iPhone X. The negative effect it has on the appearance of the product is substantial, but the destructive aftershocks it sends across the overall user experience are even bigger. In terms of materials and finishes, the iPhone X mimicks what the Galaxy S8 introduced back in April this year: high-quality glass front and back surfaces, held together by a super-nice, polished metal frame. Although, we should probably point out that Samsung uses aluminum for its frame, while Apple goes for a slightly higher-end stainless steel. Apple's top smartphone feels amazing in the hand, but it falls a bit short in one area, and that's color variants. While Samsung offers the Galaxy S8 in a total of 6 likable colors, the iPhone X is available only in Space Gray (very dark gray) and Silver (very light gray). Among the two, the Silver version is the way more interesting and exquisite one, as the Space Gray option is just that – very dark gray across the whole thing – no accents or any kind of flare. DESIGN TAKEAWAY: The iPhone X is nice, but the notch prevents it from being a work of art. It is by and large a utilitarian design in a contemporary, premium package. Even with the Galaxy S8 being a six-month old device at this point, the iPhone X feels more like a gap-closer than anything else – it fails to convince it was worth all the wait. and Notch The iPhone X is the first ever iPhone to use a 5.8” OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) display, which Apple has decided to call “Super Retina Display”. Forgive us if we don't get ourselves to use this branding anymore, ever. OLED screen technology works in a very different way from the traditional LCD, and comes with its own pros and cons. Here's a very quick summary: OLED PROPERTIES. There’s a couple of controversies surrounding Apple’s first OLED display right now: one is the so-called burn-in effect, and the other is the blue tint. We won’t lose time discussing the burn-in here, because we believe Apple has largely taken care of ensuring the OLED display will remain in good shape throughout the expected lifespan of the device. If you’d like to learn more about it, though, just check out this article. So what about the blue tint? Here’s the thing: the iPhone X display has very balanced, true-to-life, yet nice and vivid colors when viewed head-on. However, as the case happens to be with all OLED screens out there, there is a pronounced color shift whenever you view the screen at an angle, essentially making colors appear more blue-ish. This is exactly what’s going on with the iPhone X. OLED displays on Samsung Galaxy phones have always exhibited such behavior, and now Apple’s OLED display, which is also produced by Samsung, does the same. The interesting thing here is that the iPhone X’s display behaves more like a last-gen Galaxy S screen in this respect – when comparing it head to head with the Galaxy S8, Samsung’s latest flagship seems to be a bit less susceptible to these color shifts. Nevertheless, the issue isn’t so bad as to hamper the overall viewing experience with the X. The tall, 5.8” display with super-high 1125 x 2436 px resolution is quite big; however, it’s mostly taller than the iPhone 8’s display, and just a tiny bit wider. Because of this, the iPhone 8 Plus’ 5.5” screen with standard 16:9 ratio continues to offer the biggest screen area on an iPhone. The iPhone X’s display is great in that it’s so expansive, yet the phone itself isn’t too big (like the iPhone 8 Plus), but there is once again a plot twist: that irritating notch up there. You really can’t unsee the notch, and this in itself is a detriment to the viewing experience. The far bigger problem is that outside of Apple’s own apps, the vast majority of third-party applications out there aren’t optimized to utilize the full screen area on the iPhone X. This is surely going to change going forward, but for now, the experience is more than a little upsetting, because more often than not, the user it stuck with substantial black bars around the content, be it a game or video. Unoptimized apps that need to be viewed in landscape present the worst experience right now, because the phone not only surrounds them with black bars from left and right, but also clears some space under the app, in order to position the useless horizontal line – a reminder that you can swipe up to return to home at any time. Many of the most popular apps out there, like Facebook, or Instagram, or even some hit games like Super Mario Run have already been updated to take advantage of the 5.8” screen, but there’s a ton of content out there that is still giving us the black bars treatment, including high-profile apps like Gmail and Google Maps, for example. That’s one thing, but a whole other issue is the type of user experience you’ll get even after your favorite app or game has been optimized. Take YouTube, for example – a service you may be familiar with. By default, it launches videos with a generous amount of wasted, black space around them – you get close to zero benefit form the expansive screen of the X. You can then pinch-out your fingers on the screen to have the video maximize. At this point, the notch is now clearly visible on top of the video, with just a part of the rounded corners of the screen visible too. Overall, it all makes for a genuinely weird video shape. It turns out, at least for now, the YouTube app developers haven’t found a more reasonable way of handling the iPhone X’s screen eccentricity. Will others find better workarounds in the future? Let’s hope they do! Or maybe Apple could just design its future phones so they don’t have this ridiculous notch. DISPLAY SUMMARY: The new display is beautiful to look at, and the benefits of the OLED technology generally outweigh the negatives. The 5.8” diagonal is a great size, but the presence of the notch often means that you're far from taking full advantage of it right now, be it for video, games, or regular apps.. An iPhone X-periment Apple used to give us a fresh-looking iPhone once every two years. Then the iPhone 6 came along, and the company decided it could afford to lower the pacing a bit. The 6s arrived on schedule, then the 7 followed; and now we even have the 8 – all basically reusing absolutely the same design, save for some small enhancements. As a result, Apple's line-up started looking a bit conservative in comparison to some of its direct rivals. This year, we're finally getting what we've been asking for – a brave new iPhone design, albeit in a prohibitively expensive package – it starts at $999. However, Apple insists the iPhone X is way more than just a fresh set of clothes for the same thing; it wants it to be the start of a new chapter in the iPhone story, and this means we're in for some major changes in the iOS experience paradigm as well. A fresh, new look, and drastic changes to how we interact with iOS – this alone sounds incredibly intriguing, but actually there's even more to the iPhone X that may amaze, surprise or even irritate you. The iPhone X is a controversial device , that much is certain. Way more controversial than the iPhone 7 , which dropped the historical audio jack. With the X, Apple is taking a lot of risks, and introducing a lot of firsts. Funny how these two always seem to go hand in hand, right? The thing is, as mentioned in the first paragraph, Apple developed a bit of a conservative image during the last few years. And here we are now, putting Apple, risks, and firsts in the same sentence again. This tells you we have something really special on our hands, but make no mistake – it's not all sunshine and rainbows.

The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better..

(Posts: 57; Member since: 20 Jun 2017). posted on 08 Nov 2017, 11:12. before the release of iphone x the touch ID sitting on the front bottom bezel was a reminder that the phone ur using in your hand is an iPhone. Since after the release of Iphone x bezels have been reduced and touch IDi has been removed and we know iphone may have lost its identity without Touch ID but to make iphone still distinguishable from the rest of bezelles smartphones applease introduced the Face ID with Notch. From now that Notch is reminder that the phone ur using is an iPhone X. we all know apple likes to make its devices look distinguishable from rest of the world in one way or two that why for Apple that Notch is the new identity of iphone. That's why apple told the developers not to use the space around the Notch in such a way that it will blend in with the display bcoz apple doesn't wants to that Notch to be forgotten ..

This is the problem with the world, where we can't accept that a competitor to our favorite company du jour did a great job with their device and in some cases better than our favorite company du jour. If anything I want each company to keep raising the bar, because it will force others to keep reaching and surpassing that bar. When that happens, we (consumers) are the winners..

With this you have to pick up your phone or turn it on. Then you need to let it see your face then you swipe up. It takes much longer than fp so it's not good enough to replace it.

Havent used an Iphone since the 6S. Woke up at 3am to get a preorder in for the X. I just bought a Pixel 2 and wanted to see if this was the year to maybe switch over to iOS for a bit. 2 key things I think made my decisions to return it. Which I was very surprised by. 1) Screen next to my Pixel. For all of the crap the Pixel receives do to screen issues, I didnt think the Iphone's screen was anything to write home about. Sure it is nice, it is OLED and all. For all of the kudos the bionic chip gets, there seemed to be a lot of stutters here and there.It was like using a Samsung phone honestly (pre-Note 8). Which is why I love the Pixel. Again, dont get me wrong, the X is a great piece of hardware, probably the best hardware I have ever felt. Just wasnt blown away with everything else..

Apple making bad decisions in software. Posted on: December 28th, 2017 by jules. You can no longer arrange app icons on iTunes which means a nightmare to organize your apps, especially if you have a lot of folders and apps. 30% of apps no longer supported and this is the developers fault but in speaking with developers this is because an inherent design issue and request for subscription apps from Apple. Totally lost of all app data as a result. Photos is a HOT MESS bringing in thousands of duplicate photos over and over. Took 12,000 photos and made it 89,000 photos and their is NO DELETE DUPLICATE???? A disaster to organize, its like they stopped supporting it and just don't care. Who cares about a decent camera if you can't even see the photo after you have taken it? iCloud is a just as messy. No real control of your stream. No way to view and organize offline. Can no longer share photos on devices as it clogs up and shuts equipment down, stealing all battery power in under an hour. Part of this is due to the disaster that Photos has become. Don't even get me started on the disaster that the music library has turned into. The real let down is the headphone jack. None of us have been able to use the wireless, our kids have lost two sets already. I have hearing aid which cannot be used with the wireless earbuds and we have expensive audio equipment that now require we carry a dongle around everywhere, we have lost 3 of these now. You cannot just leave them on the cord because you have to remove it to interface with NORMAL CONNECTORS. The last year of Apple has been quite a disappointment for our family. We have 9 Apple devices and use music and photo apps extensively. If we cannot use Photos, iTunes, or iCloud there is no reason to have iPhones or our Macs anymore. I thought we would always be an Apple family, but now we begin the great switch over to Android and Windows and we are mad at Apple for lack of support and just plain AWFUL software changes. We will never understand why they took perfectly good user friendly products and destroyed them by taking away great option..

Make sure you get an Apple Lightening charging pad ( the Samsung isn’t near as quick and Apple’s is more reliable. Not all accessories are the same so do some research before buying. There is no comparison with this product. The Apple AirPods are awesome quality.. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of Wirefly.com.. Would Recommend to a friend.. Posted on: October 31st, 2017 by Logan Abbott. Face ID scanner works great, and the device is just an overall joy to use. The only thing that takes some getting used to is no home button, and the "notch" at the top of the display. Definitely recommend trying the iPhone X, I believe it is worth the price..

The Newest Design for the iPhone X. The iPhone X from Apple is being hyped up all over the world, with millions of Apple fans just waiting on its release. It is a beautiful model for many reasons and has potential buyers excited over the upcoming debut. The new iPhone has been radically redesigned with many features in mind, making it one of the most talked about releases in years. The designs are sure to prompt Apple fans to quickly upgrade their phones, thus spending more time in the world of Apple.. This particular change will appeal to those who want something new and exciting in their phone experience. Unfortunately, the new designs may also deter those who would love for the phone to remain the same. However, consumers will be able to interact easier with the new iPhone and will enjoy the increased screen size that the phone design is bringing to the table.. The iPhone X will be an expensive upgrade for those looking to purchase it. The basic model will retail at $999/AU$1,579/ £999. While many will balk at the price tag this new phone brings, the new all-screen device has caused higher production and design costs for Apple.. Consumers will be able to purchase the new iPhone X for the first time on November 3. Pre-orders for the phone will go live on October 27th. Larger countries will be getting in shipments first, such as the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. There had been rumors for months that there would be a delay concerning the release date of the newest device because of manufacturing issues that were forcing the time line back. However, that change was retracted and the iPhone X will be available at its originally scheduled time.. One of the biggest changes to the phone is the fact that it will look vastly different from what iPhone users are used to, as the screen itself will be bigger. This is one of the newest changes that Apple has applied to their designs. The smartphones of today are getting rid of their bezels, which are the outside frame of a device, to make room for more screen area. While Apple usually doesn’t jump on the bandwagon early on, they have designed their phone around a feature that other phones have already implemented.. The iPhone X will have one of the smallest bezels on the market, with only a lip found on the top of the screen. The screen itself is 5.8 inches and allows users to fully enjoy a phone that has a very small frame around it. The effect of this design change is sleek and aesthetically pleasing to the eye.. When compared to the last model, the iPhone 7, this newest smartphone looks like a whole new device. If you have never had the chance to hold a phone that is similar in screen size (such as the Samsung Galaxy S8), you’ll be impressed with the large and beautiful screen of the latest iPhone. This smartphone looks both sleek and smart, and it has a unique quality that users will find absolutely incredible.. One of the biggest changes with the new phone is where the home button is located. The physical home button is now hidden from eye sight, as the actual screen of the phone extends all the way down to the very bottom of the device. While this was a necessary change in order to provide consumers with a larger screen, Apple enthusiasts who enjoy similarities in their devices may find it takes some getting used to.. The actual resolution of the new screen has also been upgraded, a welcome change for the device. Apple has pushed to stay current with their designs and could not upgrade without this feature when faced with so much competition in the smartphone industry. The iPhone has now been improved in order to match its rivals. It has a Super Retina High Definition Display with an increased resolution of 2436 x 1125.. The pixel count was a completely necessary change for this phone for a number of reasons. One, the price tag demands that the iPhone offers a better pixel count. Two, the sharper screen makes any apps in use look much better, as well as allowing for a clearer web-browsing experience. Previous iPhones got away without having the sharpest looking screens as the older LCD screens were both colorful and bright. However, this change will cause an amazing difference to the phone, such as deeper blacks and richer colors. The total effect will leave consumers in awe.. When the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 came on the market, it was quickly touted as having one of the sharpest displays. Apple is now using that same technology to upgrade their phones. Instead of the same old Apple design, consumers will now enjoy a sleek model that stands out from the old models of yesterday. This is a very welcome change for those who have been with Apple for years and are looking for something new and exciting.. Many people are agreeing that the latest iPhone is hands-down the finest looking phone that the company has ever created. While the industrial design of the iPhone 4 was appealing, as was the curved lines found on the iPhone 6, something about the newest design has pushed all others aside. Not only that, the latest device has taken all of these ideas and focused them onto the new phone we see before us. Design has been a forerunner in the plans, and you can see the results when you look at the iPhone X.. The rear of the latest model is now made of glass. While it may not feel the same as the previous models many have grown to love, it is still quite secure and solid when you hold it. You won’t find any sharp edges on the sides of the device, and the phone is easy to hold. The device itself is also extremely light.. For those who have used the previous iPhone Plus Range, you will be very happy with this particular handset. While the screen is bigger than any of its predecessors, the iPhone 7 Plus was actually a bigger model.. You may get the feeling that your fingers will keep touching the displays on the phone every time you go to touch it. However, the phone does sit comfortably in your hand and you can easily interact with the functions you use the most. You will still need two hands to use some of the features, so many users will feel as though this phone is a combination of a tablet and smartphone when they go to use it. It will not be as simple when you try to reach the very top-right corner of the phone. Current users found that they had to move the phone around in their hands in order to make it work the right way.. One of the biggest changes to this model is the introduction of Face ID. In order to implement this change, Apple has gotten rid of Touch ID on the iPhone X. To put it simply, consumers will now be able to open up their phone simply by looking at it.. While this is a radical move from Apple, it is one that is being met with trepidation, at least in the early stages. Similar handsets that allowed for Face identification have been fooled by pictures of the user, which are not hard to get ahold of when someone really wants to open a phone that isn’t theirs.. To ensure the user’s safety, Apple has developed their Face ID technique to include multiple face angles. Users will need to provide different angles of their face while setting the phone up to activate the identification feature, similar to setting up a Touch ID by moving your finger all about the sensor. This provides more security to the user, which is the end goal of Apple. According to the company, Face ID will be extremely secure.. The demo that was shown to consumers did come with some worries. The demonstrator had to keep turning the iPhone X off and on in order to activate the system. There were a number of missed unlocks during the demonstration, although when the phone was held at just the right angle and distance it worked just fine. According to Apple, the phone will learn the curves and arcs of your face in time, allowing Face ID to work properly. Face ID will be an amazing feature, as long as it is accurate and learns how to tell a real person from a picture.. Since the new phone has much more of a screen to work with, the company had to make major changes to how iOS works. There is a standard grid of icons when you open the main display of the smartphone. This is one feature that has not changed. However, the very bottom of the device has been redesigned. Where you once found the home button and bezel, you will now just find the home button. With just a small graze of your hand you will get back home on your phone. While you may have some getting used to when it comes to balancing your device in your palm, this newest design works quite well.. To get to the Control Center, you may need to use two hands, as it is now located on the top right of the phones and calls for more dexterity in order to hit it.. The camera on any iPhone is always a major point of scrutiny and discussion. The discussion usually centers around how the phone can either focus better, take great shots in low-light, or something else that makes the newest phone stand out from the last one.. There are a number of camera designs that are included in the newest upgrade. The iPhone 7 Plus already included a telephoto lens which will remain on the new model. Additionally, both sensors on the phone will include optical image stabilization in order to provide you with a brighter and clearer photograph whenever you take a picture. Today, the depth sensing is the feature that everyone is talking about.. Instead of the camera being bolted on horizontally, it is now attached vertically. This goes to show that Apple wishes users to take photographs in landscape mode instead of portrait mode. This change is also necessary because of the front True Depth camera. It takes up a lot of space and is required because of the new Face ID.. The event did not show off AR, which is augmented reality, to interested consumers. There were, however, games available to try out, which were fun to play. It’s no surprise that between Google’s new ARCore and Apple’s ARKit, there will be lots of competition in the future when it comes to AR space. Developers will be challenged to create new “real” worlds as a result, with Apple being eager to get into this challenge themselves.. The front-facing camera of the new iPhone has an excellent ability to sense your surroundings, map a mask, sense your face and even transform yourself into an Animoji, or an animated emoji.. The actual camera feels very similar to previous models. The new updates are focused more on sensing the surroundings you are in rather than the actual photo-taking process. The Portrait Lighting setting is an amazing feature, as it can learn intelligently what the subject is and isn’t.. All Apple and iPhone users want to have a longer-lasting battery life. You may use your phone at work, school or home all day long and you can’t ever get through the day without carrying around your power cord. Or, you may be a light user but would like to not worry about losing power at the wrong time. No matter what, Apple is listening. While the battery size for the iPhone X was not mentioned on stage at the initial launch, rest assured that there are upgrades coming to the device.. The actual size of the battery back may be the same for now, but a major change is actually HOW you can charge the iPhone X. The new device now comes with a wireless charging feature, although this is only new to Apple, not other brands. Samsung has been leading the way in wireless charging and has included two ways of charging their phones, both wired and wireless. Qi and PMA are both supported with this feature concerning Samsung, so customers will not be obligated to make a choice.. Apple will only be supporting Qi but will have their own charger available so that consumers will be able to charge their phone sans cable. While Apple is not copying Samsung and supporting both of the methods, you can already find a large variety of charging mats that will support the new phone.. The iPhone X promises two additional hours of power for every single charge it receives. This improvement is certainly important as there are many battery-draining features of the new phone that consumers will be dealing with.. Any phone needs a strong power source, and the A11 Bionic Chipset that the iPhone X will be using is certain to handle everything the phone offers. This new engine will have enough power to handle the extra pixels that will be all over the front of the smartphone, along with the power needs of the AR sensor. There is also an overall improvement in graphical performance.. Apple is rumored to have employed a 10-nanometer manufacturing process when developing the phone. The phone will have both improved power and improved battery life. With the use of the new chip, iPhone X users will enjoy better face-unlocking features, quality photo focusing and power improvements all-around. So far, this will be the most powerful smartphone in the world, which is an important feature when you consider how many features the phone has and the quantity of pixels the phone is required to run.. Apple may have been aiming for a “wow” factor when they designed their latest smartphone. If so, they have certainly completed their mission. The all-screen font offers extremely vivid colors and the sleek new screen size is sure to impress users. While the AR effects are certainly interesting, they did not change much from previous models. However, changes could be seen at a later date.. Apple is excited to offer their newest Face ID technology, and we do tend to agree. However, users may need a little more convincing. Apple has done an excellent job of showing us why Face ID is the best security for their phone, but many are left wondering if it will be a good enough replacement for the Touch ID they are used to. While the demonstrations are not very persuasive at this time, only time itself will tell. The feature will need to be tested completely until the proper conclusions can be drawn. While everyone hopes that a product will be flawless when it comes straight out of the box, it is wise to accept there may be some bugs and kinks to work out first.. While there are still some worries and questions concerning the new iPhone X, one thing is for certain- it is without a doubt the futuristic model that many people have been waiting and hoping for.

ISO 20 | 1/229 sec | F1.8 Photo by Carey Rose. DNG Raw capture and manual control with 3rd party apps. 7MP front-facing 'TrueDepth' camera with F2.2 aperture. DPReview smartphone reviews are written with the needs of photographers in mind. We focus on camera features, performance, and image quality.. The iPhone X is the newest flagship phone from Apple. It comes with twin optically stabilized 12MP rear cameras, a 7MP front-facing camera with 'TrueDepth' technology, artificial background blur and specialized lighting effects, DNG Raw file capture, and of course is otherwise a highly capable and extremely speedy mobile device.. And it should be, given the asking price: at an MSRP of $999, the iPhone X (pronounced iPhone Ten, which I'll admit I'm still getting used to) is priced comfortably higher than many of its current competitors that also come with an emphasis on photographic prowess.. As with just about every modern high-end smartphone, the results of the picture-taking process on the iPhone are as much about clever software tricks as they are about the hardware. With the software and hardware combined, does the iPhone X truly offer image quality comparable to so-called 'real cameras?' Is artificial background blur driving the final nails into the interchangeable-lens camera coffin?. Of course, the answer isn't all that simple, and depends an awful lot on the preferences of the user behind the lens. But let's dive in and take a look at what Apple's latest smartphone shooter is capable of.. Tags: review , mobile , instagram-feature , iphone. Apple iPhone X results on Amazon.com.

It's reasonable but still the IQ is pretty sh!tty, i.e. In the "cons" the reviewer mentions a lack of sharpness. So the camera is worthless for all but those not in need of quality looking pictures or willing to post-process.. On a side note, did he mention whether there is a charging light / message indicator? Apple is too stupid for my personal owning, but I do like to keep track of just how stupid they remain. And it seems to me that prior models force users to fire up the screen and look to see charging or messages.. My device has a clean LED that can be either red, green or blue depending on purpose. So from across the room after re-entering the house, I can within 1/5th of a second save the bother of walking over to check.. Plus like nearly all recent phones (and why I am keeping my Note-4), apparently you just get to throw these away when the battery dies? Okay, maybe pay the apple store (and for me, drive 65 miles to find one).. + Apple loves minimalism, which is idiotic.. To alleviate this Apple has indeed made a way to detect battery charge, notification, etc without the use of a dedicated LED.... It may add to the cost, but it does allow for a complete remote method to check notifications, battery charge etc, just by glancing at the watch.. Good information for me to better understand what is available and gain a further glimpse of the awkward insanity of Apple. All of that to save a tiny LED light. Still not available on the 10 that commands a $1,000 price and garners rave reviews. So grateful we have an Android option.. The lack of an LED is indicator can be considered also a design feature. Having an LED may interfere with the sleek lines and curves.. I like attractive design, but no way am willing to give up basic functioning to achieve some teeny measure of the goal. Apple execs are dumb for that, the headphone removal and home button, plus inability to change battery. Besides, the LED on my Samsung Note-4 can not even be seen unless on.. Your answer is reasonable in the realm of simple discourse exploring rationale. That may slightly explain their reasoning. Could be that the light being visible even if only while on bothered their liberal brains. Obviously I find the absence inexcusable.. Agree with you regarding the non removable battery. One can say having a removable back to expose a removable battery reduces effective weatherproofing, but then the Samsung S5 managed to have a removable back and good weather proof seals. That being said the majority of manufacturers now do not have the ability to easily remove the battery without the use of heat packs to permanently destroy the adhesive used to make the phone weather tight.. Also something to note all iPhones dating back to the iPhone 3G, all have screws to access the innards of the phone. New Samsung phones all require heat to release adhesive to gain access.. The S5 and Note-4 are the last models with removable battery, as you seem to already know. Precisely why I am using the Note-4 instead of 5. Their latest S8 and Note might have even deleted the headphones jack. At least execs there are not drunk enough yet to leave out the LED indicator.. "28/56mm equivalent focal lengths", and the next APPLE will be nice to add a 14mm to make it "14/28/56mm equivalent focal lengths".. Or LG can add 3nd lens/56mm to its currently two focal lengths.. actually the focal length of the iPhone X tele lens is slightly less than the 8+ tele lens, so in essence the X tele is 52mm equivalent approx. So what again is the sensor size?. Its small like a compact pocket camera.. If your biggest concern with the X is cracking the back, you should just avoid a lot of flagship phones. LG, Samsung, etc use the glass-sandwich design on their top phones.. Some have this design feature, some don't. The Pixel 2 is mostly textured plastic, my LG V20 has a removable metal back.. do you know the reason for that? it is wireless charging. does the v20 support wc? no. does pixel 2 support wc? no. With a metal back it wouldn't be possible.. > do you know the reason for that?. Or I, for that matter; my guess though would be "because that's what Apple thinks will sell".. Did all-glass iPhone 4 support WC? No. Does plastic back prevent WC? No.. If they could produce/assemble thin wooden backs cheaply enough, they would use them at some point, rest assured. Just to be "different" enough and compel people to upgrade.. The wireless charging standard Apple chose to support really wasn't a thing back with the iPhone 4. You might as well ask why Nokia didn't have WC in its plastic dumb phones.. My Palm Pilot, and my Apple Newton didn't have wireless charging either!. BTW, the iPhone X is the best thing Apple has ever produced. And their customer service goes beyond the call of duty, and I found out in a recent experience where I thought I had cracked my screen (only cracked the screen protector, but left it on so I could continue to use the phone, only to find out 24 hours later, when Apple had shipped me a new phone overnight, that the screen itself wasn't cracked. This is why this power user sticks with Apple.. @vardims Apple stated them self that they turned back to glass because of WC. And i never said all smart phones with glass or plastic support WC. The point is it is not possible with the old back element to support it so they had to change it.. When not doing paid work, the X is all the everyday camera I need. On vacation I add my gimbal. For rough stuff, I can use a Lifeproof and detachable floating strap. Video memories at 4K 60fps, pseudo LUT in CreativeCloud, edit in iMovie, and share all on the phone :) Of course I could do that on an 8, but that P3 OLED is sweet.. My first unit had a “Ghost touch disease” , the second has a green tint on the one third of the screen, when viewed in a dark. Getting another one tomorrow- the last one. So why would I care about how well it’s caneras perform ?!:). Why not include complete EXIF data with photos? Especially GPS info? It’s fun to be able to see where the photo was taken. You use Seattle often as a backdrop and I live in Bellevue. Plus I like seeing the camera settings.. We'll bear that in mind - generally, we keep location data out for privacy concerns, especially as some of our editors are making photographs of their families at their homes. I agree that for 'around the town' stuff, it's not much of an issue.. my samsung xcover 4 phone has the same rating ip67 good for 4 feet of water...but the best part is i don't have to sync it with a program that monitors whats on my phone, and it cost $350.. You are not required to sync the iPhone X with anything if you choose not to. But how is it bad to have an application that backs up your entire phone, including all apps, settings, photo, music, etc., making it easy to restore to a new one in case of loss, theft, breakage, etc.?. While I'm sure that the Samsung Xcover 4 is a fine budget phone, its camera isn't in the same league as an iPhone X. It doesn't have optical image stabilization, a dual camera for telephoto and depth of field, or quad LED flash. It doesn't do 4K video at all and its 1080P video maxes out at 30 fps, or 1/8th of the iPhone X framerate.. Apple has the best privacy protection in the industry hands-down. money grab money grab after you back up your phone and fill your 15 free gigs they want you to pay for more, i hook my samsung to my computer and drag drop backed up simple no money exchanged...and i have a canon that goes everywhere I go. and @ewelch Linux(but not the linux on your phone) has the best protection in the industry but nice try anyhow... so-what-17 wrote "money grab money grab after you back up your phone and fill your 15 free gigs they want you to pay for more, i hook my samsung to my computer and drag drop backed up simple no money exchange". iTunes backs up my iPhone (and iPad) to my home computer (which is subsequently backed up to my two RAID 6 NAS devices of 8x3TB and 5*2TB), not to iCloud. I don't pay a penny to Apple for backups. Apple doesn't require that I back up to iCloud or use it in any way.. "Linux(but not the linux on your phone) has the best protection in the industry...". You are incorrect, even when you exclude the only versions of Linux germane to this discussion -- the Linux versions on phones.. Nothing you've written about this topic or revealed about your qualifications justifies it.. A $1200+ point and shoot camera ? Oh my.... It is more than a camera you know.. A $1200+ point and shoot phone. and patek philippe is a watch.. It's a $1200 handheld, incredibly powerful computer that also incorporates GPS, an accelerometer, an electronic compass, and a very good camera with optical image stabilization.. And your car is a $26,000 hanger for your tires, right?. Worse ooc jpeg s than one might expect for such a cameraphone really. Obvious problem with too much noise reduction and too high sharpening as well.. Going out on a limb here, but any good camera is probably not made in a glass case.. No need to buy expensive cellcamera for the looks and brand of it because nobody would know what cellphone you have because you cover it with a bumper. So, you're phone looks thicker and larger with ugly bumper. Buy cheap ones and expensive bumper. They'd ask what phone you have. And those people asking make themselves stupid.. Sarah, perhaps you think the glass lens and glass rear screen won't break when you drop that real camera. Just put it in a good case, like something from Tech21, and it will be fine.. That camera has a wireless charging - hence glass front&back.. The glass back replacement is about as expensive as some mid-range smartphones. Apple really know how to milk their "customers".. Friend of mine broke his back the first day. If you are too clumsy to go one day without dropping your phone, put it in a good case or at least have insurance.. If you can't take care of your stuff, then don't buy an expensive smartphone. I've owned smartphones since the 1990s and I've never physically broken any of them -- not so much as a scratched screen.. My iPhone X has made 3 or four face-plants on the ground from chest high level (with a case that gives it 1mm of protection) and it's screen protector has been shattered. But there's not a single mark anywhere on either side. while not a primary component of the camera itself ,...the screen of the iphone x is utilized to review images and generally view them later at one leisure. a colleague of mine who has been using apple as long i i can remember and who knows of my materials analysis backround recently asked me to look at some issue with the screen , namely scratches after only 5 weeks of use. using a hastings triplet loupe i surveyed the screen and it is literally cris crossed with scratches some simple microscopic lines some are deep and visable even with the screen operational looking at his old 6plus which i asked to see there is n where near the damage after years of use without screen protector. i think apple should replace his screen and told him persue this i fould this strange and unacceptable. Why does every one of your comments always end with someone or some entity/group. sarah why do you always write thrump 2016 ... do you earn a few dollars a post ? why would what was written above elicit such a garbage comment from you ? ive stated that the x screen was heavily scratchd in about 5 weeks i told him to approach apple with the problem. then in your typical nonsense reaction you say :. "Why does every one of your comments always end with someone or some entity/group "deserving" something?". what a stupid response , agenda driven response to my comment ... sarah you are both transparent and vile...... everyone here knows you here to divide and sow discord ..you are also a fake ... making up nonsense regularly ... just now you are trying to rally the apple users ... but they are smarter than your shenanigans. you are a paid keyboard warrior ... a pathetic existence driven by a tribal psychosis. I found out at a very young age that you don't "deserve" anything in life.. I just find it odd that certain groups of people spend a lot of their lives online campaigning for what they "deserve". I don't know what this has to do with trump or polar bears, but I am thinking it is going to end with me being the cause for climate change and russian hackers....no?. Sucks that memo dropped hey? What a burn.. please tell me where i used the word or concept "deserve"". i told my friend that five weeks of use of the iphone x should not look worse than years of use with the iphone 6 ... "burn you say "??? sarah you we outed weeks ago with your phony climate change rants ... your lame attempts to whip up a left right divide at dpr. i hope that you will soon be banned here for the garbage you post here .. you clearly are on a paid mission to disrupt normal conversations here and to inspire the same artificial ccultural divide... what country do you work for. You are so used to entitlement now, you dont even realize when you demand it anymore:. "i think apple should replace his screen and told him persue this i fould this strange and unacceptable". You've also become extremely hard to understand..... crystal clear in it's message 8). all i hear is crickets .....lol. I see Sarah The Paid Troll is employing the completely debunked meme-of-the-day: "the memo dropped." Last week it was "Millennials" and "Socialist Mob." What are you being paid to push this crap, Sarah?. Probably she is a new worker in the troll factory 🙂. No mention of the f-stop equivalency ? I needed it in order to decide if it's any good ... You know because of total light and stuff. It's on the very first page.. F-stop equivalency is moot in a cell phone camera. The f stop is the f stop for light gathering ability - it's why it's in a non-dimensional form. Wanting to know the equivalent DoF is pointless in a modern flagship phone as the output is processed to the DoF you prefer with a slider control.. The correct question is "how effective is the selective DoF in eliminating processing artifacts?". It was a joke, who care about f-stop equivalency anyway.. It would be something like F-infinite and everyone know that at F-infinite you can't take any picture. There would be no light falling on the sensor you know because of total light. > And it should be, given the asking price: at an MSRP of $999, the iPhone X (pronounced iPhone Ten, which I'll admit I'm still getting used to). Are you also getting used to Sony a7 Mk II or Canon EOS 5D Mk II?. Just returned from a month travelling in Asia, and for the first time in my life (65yrs) I took only my cel phone, iPhone X. Love the photos that I got. The iPhone X with its face ID security is so fast that I got many shots that I would have missed while waiting for my Canon S120 to gear up. And how nice to travel with only a thin cel phone in a pocket. I don’t often print over 8 x 10, so the iPhone X is adequate for my needs. I can’t see travelling with a camera in the future.. If you had bought a compact camera for the same amount of money, you'd ended up with far better pictures.. Pieter you didn't even bother to read & comprehend the post you replied too, how very crass of you.. Very good and easy to read review!. Here is what I took away: 1. The software that does the processing for lighting and DOF is pretty good and realistic looking, though not perfect. Image stabilization gets steadily worse as the resolution and shutter speed increase. RAW images are the best place to start if you want control of noise and everything else--just like "real" cameras. Tiny sensors have come a long way in 10 years. They still have some issues but I can see why the phone market has taken away from ILC market. 10 years ago I don't think I would have ever thought cell phone cameras would be plenty good for the 95% who don't want to carry a bag full of lenses. It will continue to with the exceptions of those of us who needs more control and the highest quality on large shots.. Good review, but I think you missed to touch upon two things that makes the iPhone great for photo and video: 10-bit colors and the iMovie app. With these two, I can do a lot of swift editing directly on the phone that just can't be done on an Android.. Yeah but nether is suitable for long term archival, storage, reproduction or distribution.. You are going to have to edit the shot again on your PC/MAC in lightroom or something else.. Not a whole lot of motivation for me to do that IMO. Assuming he is happy with the video edits on his phone, why would he need to redo it? Just export it as a regular format and then archive it however he normally would.. And as far as editing photos in LR mobile, those sync over to LR desktop with all edits intact. Sometimes I think people here are like the annoying "audiophiles" who don't enjoy music that isn't played with the "right" audio equipment.. The most recent smartphones produce great images. Not technically better than DSLR's, but certainly enjoyable for the majority of people who look at the image as a whole rather than each pixel.. The iPhone X is top of the pile for many people and fair play to those who go out and take great photos with it. I can see why they don't give a damn what people on the internet think of them. Photography with any camera you choose can be enjoyable.. the objectionable part of their attitude isn't that they don't enjoy "music" on things other than their high-end equipment, it's when they can't stand hearing opinions that show other kinds of equipment can be almost as good and then, they have to express their armchair opinions instead of listening to experts who do this for a living.. Single-ended pure class A with no more than 3 gain stages... the rest is indeed just rubbish.. My iPhone 6S survived countless drops to the cement with no screen cracks. Just put it in a good case and it will be fine...no facepalms required.. Nobody tell Sarah that every good SLR lens on the market is made of glass, and yet many photographers have learned not to drop them. I shudder to think what a beautiful piece like the Nikkor 14-24/2.8 would look like under a year of her care.. The difference is that most SLR cameras that hold these lenses have a decent hand grip and are much less likely to be dropped. I think I read in the review somewhere the word "slippery".. It’s quite simple, if you cant hold onto your phone or dont have it insured, put it in a good case.. That entitled child is annoyed at anything produced by Apple, even inventing trash-talk & self-styling pseudo-expert "experiences".. right now jf 69 i can say nothing apple has ever done is as pointless or out of the blue as your latest personal attack,. you are a sad excuse for a poster here at dpr. Good review and nice photos from a smartphone. It is clearly better to use the RAW capture option if you want better quality. Also nice to see a comparison between the HDR feature and processing from the DNG capture.. While my Pixel doesn't behave extremely different (it's also just a smartphone), i honestly do not get how every reviewer always gives those high scores to iPhones. The higher ISO pictures (500 and 800) are simply ridiculous. The low ISO pictures are something older Samsung S5 etc already managed.. Here is a tip, I just picked up a Nokia Lumia 930 on Ebay for £55.00, it was top of the range a couple of years ago, it has a dedicated shutter button, a great hi res screen, 2gb ram fast processor and great build quality, The Pureview camera is the best I have seen from any smartphone, it was running Windows Mobile 8.1 which was fine but was easily upgrade d to the latest Windows 10 operating system which is very similar to a desktop, I am delighted with it and it was £950 cheaper than this Apple, I also find the (sadly discontinued) Windows Phone 10 operating system and the great camera app excellent, support for this OS will continue for a few years yet and I haven't found an app that I wanted that was not available....Bargain :-) PS it is also a really good phone too. seems you haven't seen a real pureview camera like the nokia 808. Nokia 808 is indeed very good but unfortunately not a practical phone anymore because of the Symbian operating system, the 930 camera is pretty close, I think just as good personally and I like the performace and OS. there's no difference in function, performance or experience between an outdated OS like symbian and an outdated OS like windows mobile when making phone calls and photography - you press the buttons to take photos or pick up calls. of course it's understandable you'll believe and say what you own is nicer than what you don't own. There is a big difference, Windows 10 mobile has only just been discontinued, it doesn't feel outdated "yet" Facebook, Whatsapp , Fitbit, Image resizers, etc etc etc are still available and work fine, of course this will change , but for now, Windows 10 mobile is still pretty up to date unlike Symbian, as I said, I havent yet found an app that I wanted that is not available for Windows 10 mobile, it is still just as useful "for me" as Android or IOS would be, in 2 years it may well be different, but for now, £55 gives me a phone that performs "for me" as well as a £700 Android or IOS device, hardware-wise, the 930 is pretty high spec and the 950 is even better with 3GB Ram and a great screen and fast processor, I think higher end Windows phones are a smart buy right now. the 808 sensor was amazing almost 90 sq mm about 5 times the size of the sensor in the iphone. i would be great if some android maker reused this camera module somehow. big difference between 930 and 808 is the 808 has a great pureview camera, the best in nokia phones. no need to discuss bells and whistles.. Yep, the detail resolvable on an 808 is as good as on a D800 Nikon in good light. And, there is usually more detail due to the massive depth of field it has. This iPhoneX camera gives worse results than a Nokia N8 12MP sensor from 2010, but the Nokia has no Raw file capability and no 4K video. Its sensor is bigger than the iPhoneX and one must question WHY exactly nobody is using 808 Pureview size sensors now- is it the bump the greater distance needed to focus the lens creates? Well, all I can say is that it is SO much more comfortable to hold and use!! Nobody needs a cameraphone with a flush flat back: I would much prefer a comfortable rounded rear!! better sensor, zoom lens possibilities... I’m surprised that a review on a photography gear review site didn’t mention the serious reflection issue all iPhone X’s suffer from. I love my iPhone X to pieces and you’d have to pry it from my dead hands but the camera is completely useless in low light whenever there are any nearby light sources. The culprit is the back sapphire plate sealing the cameras from the elements. It’s like shooting through a window at night.. The reason camera phones are the most popular camera in the world is that 98% of people do not pixel peep nor do they want a long menu of options. The ability to turn on the the camera, shoot and share a file, is what these phones are best at. The same 98% either no longer use nor will ever buy a stand alone camera is because photography should be as simple as it was over a hundred years ago. The revolutionary Kodak Brownie camera enabled anybody to capture a photograph and this revolutionized photography. This camera was compact, preloaded with film and had no controls other than a shutter lever and a film advance. Once the film was all exposed you return the camera for processing and get another preloaded camera. Simple! Complexity is fodder for a very select few who only immerse themselves in details but have nothing to show for it. Most of the forums here are evidence of that.. "Complexity is fodder for a very select few who only immerse themselves in details but have nothing to show for it." I agree with your first half, but not with the conclusion. My family and friends seem to be happy to receive pictures I take with my DSLR, and I am sure most amateur photographers are able to produce results that are visibly better than what you get from a phone.. That said I agree with the rest of your post. It is good that phones get better and better, since most people will never use anything else, and are happy with the results they get. I am also looking forward to a new phone with better photographic capabilities for all those time when I don't want to lug my DSLR's along ;). Yes, it is the brownie camera of present day.. After reading the review, I'm puzzled how the iPhone X got a score of 89 and such a high rating for image quality. Did they not read their own review?. We have reached the terminal point of diminishing returns with regard to the price/value tradeoff. These photos don't look like they came from a $1,000 phone. They look like they came from a $400 or $500 phone—at best. Tim Cook seems to be daring the public to call BS with his outrageous price gouging but no one dares to say anything. For $1000 you can get a really nice camera and a cheap cellphone to act as your uploading device.. My LG V20 takes better photos. I have all manual controls like a SLR camera, lol. I have a 2 year old, then £300 oppo r7 plus phone with an f2.2 lens. Pictures in good light are decent but I wanted more.. Faced with spending £500 for a contract free replacement, I decided to keep the phone, bought a USB-OTG to SD card adapter, a Nikon coolpix A (APS-C, F2.8, 28mm eqiv) used for £280 and shoot raw+jpeg.. I find sharing jpegs to the phone is good enough in most cases with a quick edit in snapseed. It means I can use dead time, while on public transport for example, rather than being such in frontomt of a computer at the end of the day or a vacation.. I bought a like-new Nikon Coolpix A for $250 from B&H. I picked uup the eye level viewfinder for about $125. Then I got the Metz 26 AF2 flash, which I also use with my D7200 when I'm traveling light. I just don't use a phone for taking pictures.. my old Samsung S4 is good enough for taking phone pictures in a pinch. I can talk and txt with it too. I think I paid $100 for it a few years ago.. These days, $1000 for a phone, I don't think so.. "For $1000 you can get a really nice camera and a cheap cellphone to act as your uploading device.". But then you'd have to carry around two devices and any interface gear needed for the two. There's no reason to spend $80,000 on a nice SUV when a $25,000 truck and a $35,000 sedan would do what you need. Or a $30,000 mini van, for that matter. And yet they can't keep the $80k SUV's on the lot. Maybe there's something more than just the camera and an internet connection that matters to people?. So many people are annoyed with the price tag of the iPhone X. Sorry people, but your financial situation doesn't mean the product is no good.. My point is that if you're buying this thing with your own money rather than receiving it from your job or your parents, you're getting a so-so camera as part of an overpriced cellphone. However, from the way it is marketed you would think that it's a Leica M3 magically reduced to the size of a chocolate bar.. Apple is not the barrier-breaking supernova it was in the days of the Quadra 950. It's just another slightly shady consumer products company now, grinding out the same tired products in barely different iterations.. The tech press—and we consumers—have to start thinking of Apple as no different from Whirlpool or Sears rather than the second coming of Bell Labs.. Some people can see through the hype and bs.. I don't think gullible is the right word. Is it hype that you can combine 2-3 devices into one? That it has the backing of millions of developers? That it runs quickly and efficiently? That it offers user interface advantages over other devices? Hardly. For someone making $200k/yr, it's a trivial cost, and there are 10 million consumers just in the US who make more than that. If I were rich, you'd be darn sure I spent whatever it took to maximize my efficiency, and if that means *not* carrying around two devices with the associated connection gear, it's a small price to pay.. *I don't own an iPhone, but the current versions really are efficient at what they do.. and my old S4 can do that too.. Aren't we all here photographers? Just asking.. some are photographers and some are point and shoot snap shooters.. Apple Reports Record Results for 1Q 2018: $20B Profit on $88B Revenue, 77.3M iPhones. iPhone X surpassed our expectations and has been our top-selling iPhone every week since it shipped in November. Why would I buy NEW iPhone every year or every second year for that matter, when telephone numbers are the same .... Well of course you don't need to. Why renovate your home? Why upgrade your computer? Why buy new clothes?. I was surprised the review mentioned nothing about the default Live mode, which takes 20 photos at once, and then automatically shows you only the one it thinks best.. Since that guess is not always correct, I've been wanting to look at all 20, delete the bad ones, and choose my own favorite among those remaining. Sometimes I manage to do that, and sometimes not. So I definitely need more instructions on how that works.. But when shooting photos of fast-moving kids and animals, Live mode really helps.. In BURST MODE Just display the photo in question hit SELECT pick the one you like best.. In LIVE MODE go EDIT and select the one you like in the bottom bar. Sactojim - You really know your stuff...Genius Not iPhone X surpassed our expectations and has been our top-selling iPhone every week since it shipped in November.. Apple Reports Record Results for 1Q 2018: $20B Profit on $88B Revenue, 77.3M iPhones. They added an extra model, sold less phones in total, so the logical conclusion is that none of the 3 models was a top seller, older phones helped.. iPhone X has been our top-seller. Considering the huge price gap (+30 to 54%) between the 7 series and the X but yet relatively modest 13% increase in average phone price, worldwide none of the 3 new phones were top sellers relative to their predecessors when they were released.. Regardless of local results or single store stories.. They sold 1 million mess phones in a quarter that had one week less than last year’s. Hence it would be the same or slight year on year growth if adjusted. It is obvious that many commentors for some reason would like apple to fail. And that precludes neutral reading of the facts. Neutral fact is that they did very well Across the board, only macs slipped a bit. I wouldn’t mind failing in my work the way Apple does, if Inwould believe all the conjencture.. TrojMacReady What phones increased relative to their predecessors? That's right, none. The mobile phone market is saturated and only the cheap Chinese android phones sell well worldwide. Total the three new iphones release. "Apple says the iPhone X, iPhone 8, and iPhone 8 Plus lineup brought in the highest revenue of any iPhone lineup in the company's history. " I bet every company wished they had these problems.. Keep finding your reasons to hate. No matter how we slice it, there were 2 release moments instead of the usual 1 the last quarter and 3 instead of 2 new phones, yet unit sales went down and average price of all iPhones sold increased less than the increase of the 3 new models would suggest. So older phones sold better than expected, new phones less. Hence all the start downwards adjustments of essential parts, even those with only one supplier (OLED).. That has nothing to do with a wish to fail, no need to enter anyone's personal emotions. Yes, the market is saturated and consumers make their phones last long, simply because even older phones are now fast enough for most. Even Apple can't escape that fact. I'm just not very sensitive to marketing speak that always makes everything sound perfect, while trying to cover some obvious stains.. Why when you download the video file says "prores 422"??? So suspicious!! lol. I'm a bit confused by DPR's conclusions. In the Cons: Very slow shutter speeds in low light can result in blurry image. Huh what? Are we stating the obvious here as a con? What's next? "Cons: It can't make you coffee". As for comparing RAW to OOC jpgs, in my opinion the OOC jpgs just look better and are always sharper. From my testing if you go a step further and apply some very basic editing to them, combined with a more advanced shooting app like Halide, where you can control shutter speed and ISO, the iPhones jpgs are just stunning. More importantly the OOC jpgs are only going to get better and close the gap in areas they're lacking with newer versions of iOS and the phones.. What's so confusing? In the review they mention that the phone tries to keep the ISO levels as low as possible, which results in unusually long shutter speeds. Which makes sense, since this "camera" basically isn't usable at high ISO levels.. I haven't been able to find what the maximum ISO value is the X allows, but the iPhone 8 only went up to ISO 800. But looking at the ISO 800 shot of the woman at the table, the X is already hopeless at that point, so it makes sense that Apple would program it to use longer shutter speeds than an actual camera would.. Please fellow photography enthusiasts, learn from my mistake, and DO NOT view the ISO 800 photo at full-size!. There is always going to be competition between big brands, i.e. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Sony, Canon, Nikon etc. For as long as we have consumers buying products for "brand name" there will be delays in making innovative products. We need smart consumers to fast forward the slow progress of any proruct, not loyal consumers.. also, you might be overestimating the homogeneity of consumer's needs. there are a number who will pay for the cheapest usable product available and those who will shed their product immediately to get the latest shiny object. "brands" are not just going to cater to one base.. Fully agree! How people dare to make sh** buying decisions? Be a smart consumer: purchase like *me*! er.... Time Magazine wrote that I told Apple to come up with a smartphone and to call it the iPhone and that Apple followed my advice two years later!. My forum name was cortland, the second person mentioned, right after bill gates.. Interestingly, the response to my suggestion was negative, as shown in the forum, and nobody in that forum thought the idea had merit.. Do you think I deserve that honor?. (I took that picture of my wife not smiling). George, I think you got too much credit by the Time Magazine article. You guessed the name right (easy), but Jobs did something completely different than you proposed. Just look up that Treo 650 that you accepted as a viable hardware option.. I think you was much more visionary in your second post in the same thread. The post where you called Donald Trump a president ... @falconeyes: sour grapes with a tinge of jealousy?? Go work on your English composition.. George, that means you were responsible for the Moto Rokr... hardly something to be proud of.. Wife has the iphone 8s yup nice photos as long as you don't pixel peep..because as here with the x if you do YIKES. I had the s7 edge and iPhone 7 Plus before. This X si the best camera ever had. I like to see my photos on tv of 50 inches and I love the quality of this iPhone. Also my father , that is fan of canon, is been impressed for the quality of this iPhone. At who think to can comparate it to an android, just don’t it. Because android don’t have quality of lens, also the pixels 2, and especially the software isn’t optimized to give you the best result. On a pixel 2 for example you have the same operation system, basically, of a smartphone of 80 euro. The same compression software about the photo. I don’t talk about the format only. I saw it comparated to my ex s7 edge, on tv or computer I saw the poor quality comparate to an iPhone. An the camera of this X is 5 years forward every other smartphone.. I always enjoy DPRs reviews and comments, and the test photos because I live in a Seattle suburb. I wish the photos also contained EXIF info, so I could tell exactly where they were shot.. This review saved me some $$$ because I see no need to replace my iPhone 8+.. Hardware wise the iPhoneX camera is superior to the Pixel 2 but with off device algorithms the Pixel 2 may give superior results?. Having said that, I use the LR mobile app/camera on my iPhone X and have a LR subscription.. How does this come into play with the Pixel 2 vs iPhone X for photography?. Why should the iPhone X camera be better hardware wise? Or do you mean the second camera? The pure specs of the Pixel 2's camera are better as the sensor is larger. But the specs mean nearly nothing. Even the raw files can be much worse despite better specs.. I had a couple of tester phones end of last year and the X stands out as a well rounded and quality photo phone. And yes, I’m one of the very few suckers who bought one but I have clients who ask for iPhone pictures and I tend to deliver the best available at the Time of assignment, as do most of the pros who actually shoot this for publication. Maybe we’re at a crossroad where the real high end stuff does not appeal to the broader market, I heard Soderbergh is shooting his next movie on an iPhone. I’m sure they won’t be using iPhone 4 and 5s.... An iPhone can capture great quality images and videos within certain conditions. Anything outside of that and you need a real camera.. An iPhone is a real camera. Just like a Medium format used "within certain conditions" (not sports etc.) is a real camera. And a gopro and a etc...... An iPhone is a "real camera?" Please. I'm tired of the lines being blurred & traditions not being respected. Next thing you know we're going to argue that it's "narrow minded" and "elitist" to say that a man should only use the men's room. My point is that an iPhone can only take quality photos within fairly limited conditions. If you want pretty snapshots in bright daylight, you're good to go. For anything else, you will be disappointed.. freediverx An iPhone is a real camera. Just like a Medium format used "within certain conditions" (not sports etc.) is a real camera just like a GoPro etc. And I've taken many low light images that turned out just fine when i didn't have my other cameras with me. A compact digital camera or a DSLR has a vastly wider degree of versatility than an iPhone camera. If the iPhone's only function were its camera, few people would buy one.. The iPhone is for all practical purposes the camera I use most—because it's the only camera that's with me 24/7. But I wouldn't dream of going on vacation or to some special event with nothing but my iPhone as a camera.. Thanks for the comments, as stated I think it’s a great photo phone and that I have clients requiring sometimes that images or video is shot with them. But mostly I do shoot Hasselblad MFD, or if a DSLR/35mm solution is more appropriate the 1DX II or Sony A9 and for moving image there’s mostly a version of an Arri Alexa on set. iPhone X is over-hyped, over-priced and over-rated. Apple is rumored to halve production due to low sales to maintain the over-pricing. Apple stock price tanked at 5%. But if you look at Apple Stock Chart it goes up ... up again and down again ... Who'd buy iPhone X if they have working 6,7&8? It is like why buy G1xMiii when they have G7xMii working like G1xMiii and no body can know the difference.. Why buy or upgrade to Nikon D850 and collateral lenses when they have working Canons and older Nikons?. That is why dSLRs sales is grabbing at straws so is Apple iPhone X.. I will buy this behemoth when the price drops because this phone is waterproof. I like to videochat with Mom while underwater.. I'm glad you listen to rumors. Yes, Sir, we listen to rumors. So is my investment money to play.. "iPhone X is over-hyped, over-priced and over-rated.". and if it isn't it should be.. That is the sole job of the marketing dept.. Do you feel the same way about, say, Ferrari, Aston Martin, Rolex?. Another, chomping on the bit, Apple hater.. No one is forcing you to buy the phone. So hate less and enjoy more. I own one, and I'm not planning on jumping on googles' boat, for as long as the iOS echo system is alive.. This has nothing to do with hardware performance.. I NOT going to spend $1000 on a phone, any phone. Though, PlusNet is doing a good deal at the mo.. You sound like the sort of person that reads a lot of clickbait headlines while rarely looking into the true story.. Is the ios "echo system" what you ear when placing call on those phones ? I know their call quality is not their forte :). Hehe I just found it quite appropriate to my past experience with iPhone call qualities.. Mariano Pacifico "iPhone X is over-hyped, over-priced and over-rated." Insert Leica Leica is over-hyped, over-priced and over-rated.. You know who else got an education from Wharton? Trump. I agree with over-hyped and over-priced. What an amazing screen! I can read my newspaper on-line without squinting. Face ID is much better than a home button for us Minnesotans. The CPU is an order of magnitude faster than the competition. To the original point, whether the iPhone X is overpriced really depends on the person considering it, their level of discretionary income, and the value they think it will provide to them. And if you have an earlier iPhone you are happy with then of course you don't need to get a newer iPhone, but it 8 or X.. What a waste of time this review was because this grossly overpriced phone failed miserably in the marketplace causing Apple to discontinue it.. No matter the product, a review is a good thing. I’m confused by how the opposite is true.. Grossly overpriced? Such a subjective statement. I know it can be a shock that people who work hard enough, make enough money, and then do as they please with that money.. But obviously propaganda makes people like you happy, so feel free to continue autosuggestion.... at least the batteries don't explode!. SpencerSL Grossly overpriced was based on facts. The fact is the iPhone X sales fell well below expectations. Can you give a better explanation. Of course you Apple fanboys, the ones who worship at the altar and wait in line to buy every new iPhone, will never admit that. Disclaimer, I own an iPhone 6s.. Evidently the iPhone X, a phone starting at 999$ outsold the 8. There is no way it is a flop.. What all these morons fail to understand is that these clickbait headlines are a bunch of clueless rumor-mongering based on a not so scandalous development.. Recall that Apple only made the first generation iPhone for one year, then came out with a completely redesigned model. Does that mean that the first one was a flop?. While the original iPhone X may no longer be offered next year, rest assured we will have a new model with all the same features and more.. "What Kuo said is that Apple might stop producing new iPhone X units once they’ve made enough to keep shelves stocked until September. Kuo does suggest that this *might* be because sales of the iPhone X are disappointing (particularly in China), but Kuo’s record is only good regarding what is going on in Apple’s Asian supply chain, not why.". "If Kuo is correct that the iPhone X will be dropped from next year’s iPhone lineup, I don’t think the reason has anything to do with how well it sold.". "When the iPhone 3G debuted, Apple stopped selling the original iPhone. In fact, the more I think about it, the more it feels like it’s fair to say that the norm is for radically new iPhone form factors not to remain in the lineup at a lower price the next year.". Apple is going to discontinue the "X" at the end of the year, instead of offering it at a lower price in future years. That makes sense to me, since the "phone" part of the iPhone X is out-of-date. I plan to trade mine in at the end of the year.. "Grossly overpriced was based on facts. The fact is the iPhone X sales fell well below expectations. It is more expensive, not overpriced. The former is an objective fact while the latter is a subjective consideration.. good timing of this 'impressive'review when the sales are falling...... and good to hear that there is finallly an 'american'android device to compare...... Some Android phones have great cameras. But the Android platform is a cesspool.. Did anyone notice that the iPhone X default camera app are sucks!I mean, when you are taking a photo with it, then you adjust the exposure in the app, you'll find that the finale image is quite different from the screen, for example, when you taking a picture in a dark area,then you try to turn down the exposure, you can see it from the screen was exposed correctly, but the final picture you just take it becomes very dark, but from the screen everything are perfect!I try the 3rd party photography app like Camera+ or manual camera,they are works really well, don't have any issues with the exposure.. It doesn’t like reds for some reason. It also, occasionally “dragonizes” skin tones for no apparent reason. By really pumping up the micro contrast in some situations, the portraits turn out really bad.. Otherwise, I’m liking it as a simple product photography cam. I can get decent product photos in seconds, so I’ve stopped using my DSLR completely in that regard. Also having the 56mm lens / camera is nice. A quote from the review (on DPR) "Colors though are generally pleasing and images offer the perception of good detail at normal viewing sizes. If you zoom in to check out different parts of the scene, though, you'll notice that fine details really suffer". Also, in conclusion they state the phone has good (not great or excellent) overall image quality.... Come on Apple sort out that crappy jpeg processing already!!. but wonder how many people really care about this marginal camera improvement. I pitty apple for finding themselves in a situation where all they can really do is feed the iPhone beast to grow (move the needle). Apple as it stands today will thrive and fall on one performance and profitability of the iPhone.. It may be prudent for them to start breaking the company to focus on specific categories since some of them are actually growing but to small to matter for their bottom line.. Your suggestion for Apple suggests a lack of understanding of what makes Apple successful in the first place—a common phenomenon among the finance types who read and write for Bloomberg.. Why do I have keep coming across articles on mobile phones on photography websites?. Yeah they take pretty snapshots on their pin head sized sensors, but it’s like reading about skateboards on car websites because they also take you from a to b.. Maybe because only complete and utter gear-wankers still think you can't do photography with modern phone cameras. You have your heads so far up your FF-worshiping pixel-peeping butts, that you fail to realize photography isn't about equipment.. Phone cameras of today are simply amazing. People have been taking legendary shots for decades with infinitely inferior equipment. In case you are unable to take a good photograph with a camera because it has, and I quote, a "pin head sensor", then you are quite a pathetic "photographer" (please note the quote marks).. Or maybe you are just a common troll, which is equally pathetic.. I personally don't mind coming across articles on mobile phones here but that comment was pretty harmless, it really didn't deserve such a hostile reply.. dpreview has been posting mobile phone reviews for years. also, people can ignore articles they don't care for instead of complaining in the comments, no matter how harmless some may think about comparisons to pinheads and skateboards are. Melchiorum If by "gear-wankers" you mean real photographers vs snapshot taking soccer moms then I agree with you. Smartphones suck as cameras if you are serious about photography. Back in the day smartphone users would have been using Kodak Brownies.. I apologize for such a hostility. It's just that every time phones are mentioned on DPR, we get elitists posting comments talking about how phone photography is not a thing. As someone who has actually earned money from shots taken with my old phone (because I didn't have a camera with me) and understands what makes a good photograph, I get triggered sometimes by such stupidity. Though, again, I agree that my response was too harsh and I should have been more chill about it.. @tbcass, I am yet to meet a single real working photographer who would have said they couldn't take a great shot with a phone camera (and I've met quite a a number of them). I do know photographers though who did take such shots and got paid for them. So no matter how many times gearheads make claims that phones not being "real cameras", they aren't going to get any closer to the truth.. Yes, proper equipment will let you take better shots and phones are far from perfect tools for proper photography. However, contrary to proper equipment, your phone is always in your pocket and if you actually understand photography, it will be good enough for you to get a shot in many situations.. Your comment seems to come from either Arrogance or a willful Ignorance.. Maybe the real problem is how technology is classified. Is it just a phone, there’s a myriad of uses.. In photography, it happens to be the most used camera worldwide.. The A11 chip in an iPhone puts it on par with a MacBook Pro not a cheap chrome book.. The iPhone shoots 4K video and FHD at 240fps. The $2500 GH5S, is the only camera not around the $10,000 range that can do so.. There are lens kits that can be attached to the iPhone made by Carl Zeiss. The same people who make lenses for microscopes to telescopes, and full frame cameras.. As many have pointed out before, the most famous pictures in history were made with far more inferior technology.. Camera gear does not make the photographer, the photographer makes the gear credible.. The best most expensive gear in the world is meaningless, if the best shot at a wedding turns out to be a candid shot from an iPhone.. If conditions are right I can take an good photo with my iPhone. I'm assuming a compositionally good and artistically pleasing photo. The problem is the situations where the iPhone or any smart phone will take a photo that looks good above a 4x6 print is extremely limited. If you are shooting stationary people or scenery in good light fine but for anything else the phone camera won't cut it. The sensor is too small and the lens too limiting. You don't see people successfully shooting sports, wildlife, birds in flight or anything that needs to be printed very large with smartphones.. The famous photos with inferior tech you reference were taken with film and lenses which could produce photos with IQ vastly superior to any smartphone or even some digital cameras and were used by photographers skilled in their use. Ansel Adams used large format view cameras that produced IQ better than all but the best digital cameras despite their technological simplicity.. It is appalling and ridiculous that anyone who calls themselves a professional would DARE use a snapshot-grade camera in their work. Are you kidding me? They're fine for the soccer moms taking snaps of Jr hugging Fido or college sorority girls taking duck-lipped selfies, but serious photographers? Oh please.. Back in the 1980s--and I know it's the year 2018 but in my opinion what was true in the 1980s is still true now--if you wanted to advance in your craft and be taken seriously, then you got at least a 35mm SLR. You would not DARE be caught dead using a Kodak 110 or Polaroid camera, EVER. It was beneath the dignity of a real photographer to be caught dead doing such a thing, using the camera that the everyday snapshooters used. You got something like a Pentax K1000, Nikon FM or Canon AE-1 and you learned how to use it. The same is still true today.. Good grief, we have models like the Sony RX100, if you need something small.. no matter how narrow one's definition of professionals, serious or real photographer is, dpreview is a photography website that discusses cameras in phones, and the problem is not with dpreview, it is the commenters with the superiority complex. A superiority complex is a GOOD thing, it means one has actual STANDARDS. I'm getting to where more and more I think "snobbery" and "elitism" is a GOOD thing at such times. It means you don't accept, say, that a microwaved Hot Pocket is something in the realm of the culinary arts, and that real golfers don't use broomsticks, and that tacos from Taco Bell are not the same thing as something made by someone who is from Mexico & makes it the right way.. Calling something superior that actually is superior is not having a superiority complex. :-) Trying to equate a smartphone camera to a real camera is an indication of overcompensating for an inferiority complex.. Melchiorum, that was gracious of you and I see why you took offense. I don't like to use my old phone for taking pics but I agree with you, the smartphones today are amazing and I'm looking to buy a new one.. I'll stick with my Canon A720 IS running CHDK firmware, AA batteries and all.. I'm not impressed with your Canon A720 either. the point is that pixel 2 xl is better than this. The point is not many care but you.. A full review of the Pixel 2 is on its way.. Pixel is better and so is the Essential. Every single detail is much better designed in the Essential than in X.. The point is that the Pixel 2 has the fingerprint reader on the backside. How can I unlock it while beeing mounted in a holding clamp in my car?. The wonderful features of android called Smart Unlock. You can use Bluetooth connection to make your phone automatically stay unlocked in certain conditions if the device is a trusted device. So what if the Pixel 2 or whatever is better. I wouldn't buy a phone because of the camera. I doubt very much if anyone would notice the rather small difference between iPhone X and Pixel 2. Perhaps pixel peeping idiots but nobody else cares.. Total: 97, showing: 1 – 50. Fujifilm X-H1 versus X-T2: what does the new camera bring?.

Apple iPhone X Review: The X Factor. When Steve Jobs introduced the first iPhone ten years ago, he promised that Apple’s first smartphone will revolutionise the smartphone industry, which it did. The iPhone turned out to be an instant hit. It was not only smarter than competing devices of those times but also much easier to use. For a majority of the past decade, almost all modern smartphones have been inspired by the iPhone, featuring a big capacitive touchscreen, a naturally scrolling user interface, a home button, a non-removable battery and lots of apps. However, over the past few years, HTC, LG, Samsung and Xiaomi were quicker to implement newer technologies in their smartphones, including OLED screens, bezel-less screen designs, and wireless charging, overtaking Apple in terms of smartphone design.. Apple’s reluctance to implement new features in iPhones led tech pundits and even consumers to question whether Apple has lost its zeal to innovate, something that Steve Jobs always focussed on when he was alive. To silence all the doubters, Apple released an all-new iPhone this year. Since 2017 marks the ten-year anniversary of the iPhone, Apple named its new smartphone the iPhone X (read as iPhone Ten). It isn’t anything like previous iPhones. It incorporates a lot of new technologies, right from an OLED HDR screen with minimal bezels, a shinier design, the most powerful smartphone processor ever, faster connectivity, and wireless charging. It even became the first phone ever to implement 3D face scanning as a user authentication system.. So, is the iPhone X the best smartphone ever or is it just the best iPhone? Does it really warrant an astronomical price of Rs. 1,02,000 (for the 256GB variant)? Let’s find out in our in-depth review.. The iPhone X marks a radical change in Apple’s smartphone design ethos. It has extremely thin bezels, thereby allowing a larger screen to fit into a smaller-sized device. Hence, carrying an iPhone X doesn’t feel like you’re carrying a brick in your pocket, something that I always feel while using the Plus variants of the iPhone. Apple has also replaced a metal back with a glass one this year, making it easier to design antennae and implement wireless charging. Coming back to the bezel-less screen, smartphone brands have their own ways of designing phones with bezel-less (well, I like to call them less-bezel displays) screens. The technology hasn’t matured enough yet to fill the complete front fascia of the phone with its screen, because the front-facing camera, the earpiece, and the proximity sensor need to be on the front. While Xiaomi shifted the sensors and the camera below the Mi MIX 2’s screen where there’s some room left, Samsung chose to have symmetrical-yet-minimal bezels at the top and bottom of the screen. On the other hand, Apple chose to maximise the screen real estate by filling the complete front of the iPhone X with the screen, leaving just the area where the front-facing camera and sensors are placed without the screen, thereby creating a ‘notch’.. There was a lot of hue and cry about the notch when Apple first showcased the iPhone X on the stage, and consumers were left with numerous questions and doubts as to how it will affect the viewing experience. When I first started using the iPhone X, the notch seemed like a hindrance, but I learnt to ignore it within the first week. Overall, thanks to a 5.8-inch screen and bezel-less design, the iPhone X feels comfortable in the hands. It fits even inside the tightest pockets without many problem. The phone feels solid, and has a heft to it, which makes it feel premium. However, thanks to glass front and back, you’ll have to be extra careful with it since a drop can lead to shattered glass and tens of thousands worth hole in your pocket. It is quite resistant to dust and water, though, thanks to its IP67 certification. The stainless steel sides of the iPhone X are prone to scratches. Moreover, the vertically placed dual-camera module protrudes quite a bit, making the phone rattling when it is placed on a flat surface. It’s best to use the iPhone X with a case if you don’t want it to rattle.. There’s no 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone X, and there should be no excuse for not having one as it causes users a lot of pain. While Apple ships a Lightning port to 3.5mm headphone port converter in the box, it can easily be forgotten or lost. If you end up losing it, you’ll have to shell out Rs. There are only two decent Lightning earphones in India, and both of them cost a bomb. Due to the lack of a dedicated headphone port, you lose the ability to listen to audio through headphones while charging the iPhone. While there are a few dongles that allow you to do that, you’ll have to spend some extra dough. Overall, the iPhone X looks modern and unique, but it’s quite fragile. Apple could’ve done better with using a rear-facing fingerprint reader and slightly larger top and bottom bezels to accommodate the front-facing camera and the sensors without creating a notch for an even better experience.. Bezel-less OLED display with the notch. The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen, and it is the first iPhone to use an OLED panel and a bezel-less design. This brings Apple on par with 2017’s smartphones. The notch, which hides the front-facing camera, proximity sensor, and all the sensors used for the Face ID system, is an eyesore, at least for the first few days. You learn to overlook it after some time, though. However, it still feels like a hindrance while watching full-screen videos. Coming to the quality of the screen, Apple has used the best OLED panel from Samsung, the maker of world’s best smartphone OLED panels. The screen is insanely bright, has accurate colours, and the content looks like its painted right on the top of the screen. The screen is HDR (HDR10 and Dolby Vision) and Wide Colour Gamut compliant, too. It can reach a peak brightness of over 1,000 nits while playing HDR videos through Netflix or Vimeo, and it’s an amazing experience.. Apple doesn’t allow tweaking the colour calibration on the iPhone X because it has the best colour-calibrated screen ever. The TrueTone feature adjusts the white balance according to the ambient light temperature, making it easier on the eyes. If you want to filter out blue light, you can turn on the Night Mode manually or schedule it according to the local sunrise and sunset times. I hope that Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, and YouTube start supporting HDR on the iPhone X. Quality-wise, it is the best screen I have ever used on a smartphone. However, we think that the Galaxy Note 8 offers a better viewing experience due to its symmetrical bezels around the screen and the ability to customise the colours as per a user’s preference. 3D Touch remains a useful feature that lets you perform quick actions easily.. Similar to the iPhone 8 Plus, the iPhone X has a dual rear-facing camera setup for bokeh effect. It consists of two 12-megapixel sensors, dual-tone LED flash, and the ability to record 4K videos at 60fps. However, since the iPhone X is special, it gets something extra in the imaging department. It is the first iPhone to feature optical image stabilisation (OIS) for both the camera sensors. Moreover, the secondary camera also gets a wide-aperture treatment (at F2.4 compared to F2.8 on the iPhone 8 Plus). Hence, even the secondary rear-facing camera with 2x optical zoom can click brighter, shake-free images and videos, even in low-light conditions. Everything else remains the same, right from the sensor size to the video recording resolution. The phone can also record 1080p slow-motion videos at 240fps. The iPhone X’s front-facing camera uses the same 7MP sensor from last year’s iPhones, but it is now accompanied by Face ID’s depth-sensing mechanism, so it can click images with background blur (also known as Portrait Mode on most smartphones). The front-facing camera can record 1080p videos at 30fps. It can also be used to create fun ‘Animojis’.. We tested the iPhone X’s front and rear-facing cameras in a variety of situations, including scenes with bright sunlight, artificial lights, and low-light conditions. We tried capturing people, animals, vegetation, landscapes, and a lot more subjects, and were pretty satisfied with the iPhone X’s camera. All the images showcased wide dynamic range and high amount of details. However, we also noticed that Apple has tweaked its image processing after consumers complained of bland-looking images from last year’s iPhones. This year’s iPhones have slightly warmer colours. No wonder, images clicked in low-light conditions had a orange/yellow tint to them. Also, the exposure was set lower than it should’ve been in low-light conditions, resulting in darker images. The Galaxy Note 8, Galaxy S8, HTC U11, and OnePlus 5T consistently clicked images with better exposure metering under similar scenarios. The quad-LED flash on the iPhone X is quite powerful, though, and can brighten up most subjects, unless you’re when clicking images of a scenery.. The Portrait Mode, which clicks images with DSLR-like background blur effect, has been improved on the iPhone X. Also, thanks to the A11 Bionic’s machine learning capabilities, Apple could implement artificial lighting (named Portrait Lighting in true Apple fashion). There are five effects to choose from, and Stage Light Mono is the most dramatic of them all, but it’s also the hardest to get it right. I found that the Studio Light and Contour Light effects work well in most scenarios. Portrait images clicked using the front-facing camera are not that great. The Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL click relatively better background-blurred images using their front-facing cameras. If you want to record 4K videos at the ultra-smooth 60fps frame rate, you’ll have to choose the high efficiency video codec (HEVC) format, which could mess up compatibility with older devices. 4K videos have plenty of details but the video stabilisation is not as good as the one that’s used in the Pixels 2 phones and even the Galaxy S8/Note 8.. iOS 11, which comes pre-installed on the iPhone X, has brought a tonne of UX changes. It has been designed keeping the new iPhone X, it’s bezel-less design, its notch and the lack of a home button in mind. First of all, the Control Centre has been moved to the top, and you can access it by swiping down from the right side of the notch, while notifications can be accessed by swiping down from the right side of the notch or by swiping down from the notch itself. That’s confusing, isn’t it? Moving on, the swipe up from the bottom of the screen, which used to open the Control Centre on older iPhones, is now used to go back to the home screen.. To add to the confusion, the power button now also acts as a way to summon Siri. You have to long press it to activate the Apple’s AI-powered digital voice assistant. Since there’s no physical home button, you have to click the power button and the volume up button at the same time to capture a screenshot. To open the multi-tasking menu, you have swipe up from the bottom of the screen halfway up. If you want to kill an app that appears in the multi-tasking menu, you’ll have long-press the app card till a red ‘close’ icon appears on its left corner, then either tap on that icon or swipe up the card. To sum it up, iOS is no longer an intuitive smartphone operating system, especially on the iPhone X. iOS 11 was also supposed to offer iMessage Sync among all Apple devices tied to the same account, but the feature is nowhere to be seen.. Speaking of positives, iOS 11 brings built-in screenshot editor and annotating tool as well as a screen recording tool. You can arrange the order in which apps appear in the sharing menu. The new Files app lets you arrange individual files, and there’s an option to integrate cloud storage services, including Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, and Adobe Creative Cloud. There’s a built-in QR code scanner inside the Camera app. The stock Notes app can be used to scan multi-page documents using the camera. The Gallery app can be used to change Live Photo animations, and there are three to choose from: Bounce, Long Exposure, and Loop. You can even change the precise moment from the Live Photo which should be displayed as the thumbnail for the an image inside the Gallery app. All the stock apps have been redesigned with a focus on content and images.. iOS 11 also brings support for augmented reality (AR), and there are hundreds of apps and games that offer some kind of AR experience. The Control Centre can now be customised, finally! While installing new apps or games from the App Store, iOS 11 prompts you to double-click the power button to start user authentication using Face ID, after which the download and installation starts. It also becomes easier to share stickers, emojis, and games with friends through iMessage. Siri is now even more powerful, and Indian users can now check out IPL and cricket scores. There’s a newer version of AirPlay, logically named AirPlay 2, and it brings support for multi-room audio, but I couldn’t test it because I did not have access to more than one AirPlay compatible speaker.. The A11 Bionic chipset runs the show on the iPhone X, and it is insanely powerful. It uses two high-performance CPU cores (Monsoon) clocked at 2.39GHz and four power-efficient CPU cores (Mistral). Apple’s second-generation CPU controller allows all six cores to run at the same time (also known as heterogeneous multi processing or HMP), and this feature was missing in iPhones since a long time. The A11 Bionic is also Apple’s first chipset to use a GPU that has been completely designed in-house by the company. The GPU has three cores, and it is the most powerful GPU used in any smartphone till now. There’s 3GB of LP-DDR4X RAM and 64GB or 256GB of ultra-fast NVMe storage. As a result, the iPhone X’s performance is excellent, light and heavy tasks alike. You can be sure that any game that you play on the iPhone X will achieve a smooth frame rate of over 60 frames per second.. The only place where I felt that the iPhone X’s performance could be better is its ability to keep apps in the memory. No more than five apps remain in the memory at the same time. No matter how fast the processor is, it won’t be of much use if the phone can’t keep at least 10 apps in its memory. Even mid-range Android phones like the Mi A1 do better than the iPhone X in this regard. The performance is great in other areas, though, including the audio quality through loudspeakers as well as the quality of signal reception. The iPhone X has some of the best loudspeakers, and they do well in both clarity and volume. Heck, you can even notice some bass. The loudspeakers on the HTC U11 come close to the ones on the iPhone X, but the ones on the iPhone 8 Plus are slightly clearer than the other two. It’s a shame that Apple isn’t using any high-bitrate codec for Bluetooth such as aptX, aptX HD, or LDAC. The W1 chip inside Apple’s AirPods and Beats series of earphones/headphones only improves the connection range and stability, but not the audio quality itself. Cellular reception and call clarity is great, too, thanks to the glass back.. Let’s talk about Face ID now. It has been in the news ever since it was announced during the launch of the iPhone X. The Face ID 3D face scanning and recognition technology replaces the Touch ID fingerprint reader used in all the iPhones since 2013. It uses the company’s TrueDepth camera, which projects 30,000 infrared dots on a user’s face to create its 3D depth map and saves it in the phone’s secure element. Then, the same information is used to authenticate a user while they’re unlocking the phone, buying apps or content, and in various other third-party apps. Face ID is quite fast and secure, but not as fast or easy to use as the Touch ID fingerprint reader. The biggest problem arises when the phone is resting on a table, and you want to unlock the phone. With a fingerprint reader you could unlock it easily, but with face scanning you have to pick up the phone and bring it in front of your face to get the job done. I would’ve preferred a rear-facing fingerprint reader over Face ID, which would’ve made the notch smaller as well.. Apple did something new with the iPhone X’s battery as well. Unlike most phones, the iPhone X has two batteries, one placed vertically and the other placed horizontally. Combined, the device has a battery capacity of 2716mAh, and it supports fast charging (50% in 30 minutes) as well as fast wireless charging (after iOS 11.2 update). However, even after charging a bomb, Apple doesn’t ship a fast charger for its phones in the box, and that’s a shame. If someone wants to fast charge their shiny new iPhone, they’ll have to shell out an excess of Rs. 5,000 for Apple’s USB-C Power Delivery charger and USB-C to Lightning cable. You can buy a third-party USB-C Power Delivery compatible wall charger for around Rs. However, even when you use a compatible fast charger, the iPhone X stops charging rapidly after its battery gets charged to 80%.. I charged the iPhone X using the default charger and Samsung’s Fast Wireless Charger during the course of the review. The phone took close to 3.5 hours to fully charge using the supplied charger. Charging the iPhone X using Samsung’s Fast Wireless Charger was faster. Coming to the battery life, the iPhone X did as good as most high-end phones. It always lasted a complete day even with heavy usage. Since iOS doesn’t show the complete screen-on figures, try to calculate the screen-on time of each app from the battery menu. However, going by my day-to-day usage, the iPhone should offer five hours of screen-on time, bringing it to the same level as that of the Galaxy Note 8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus, and better than the likes of the Galaxy S8 and the iPhone 8. The iPhone 8 Plus, which has a slightly larger capacity battery, lasts up to 1.5 days with the same usage pattern.. After testing the iPhone X for over a month since its release in India and putting it through the paces, we ended up liking the smartphone due to its excellent screen, good image and video quality, excellent stereo speakers, fast performance, well-optimised software, and day-long battery life. However, looking at its astronomical price, we think that Apple could’ve done better, especially some aspects of its design. It could’ve used a rear-facing fingerprint reader and make the notch disappear by using slightly bigger bezels. The exclusion of the 3.5mm headphone port hurts the user experience, too. iOS 11 feels unintuitive due to its confusing gestures and button combinations to get even simple things done. The iPhone X is an excellent smartphone, but we expected something better from Apple, especially at the price of the iPhone X.. The Apple iPhone X is one of the premium smartphones in the market; the device packs more power than the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. The device features an OLED display which is a first from the company. Also, there isn't a fingerprint scanner, and the iPhone X also does not come with a front-facing home button. Face ID replaces Touch ID on the iPhone X which lets users unlock the device by just looking at it. For imaging, the smartphone comes with dual 12-megapixel which along with a dual-tone LED flash that helps you shoot images in the dark. The rear camera also comes bundled with features such as optical image stabilization, autofocus, etc. The iPhone X is also equipped with a 7-megapixel front-facing camera.. The iPhone X promises seamless and lag-free performance courtesy the proprietary 64-bit processor A11 chipset and 3GB of RAM. Users can enjoy flawless multitasking which is always expected out of an iPhone. For storing files, data, and apps, the iPhone X ships with an onboard storage capacity of 64GB which is non-expandable as there isn't any microSD card slot.. One of the most important aspects of the iPhone X (iPhone 10) is its OLED screen. The device flaunts a 5.8-inch Full HD OLED display. The screen is bright and reproduces vibrant colours even when placed under severe conditions. The iPhone X sports ultra-narrow bezels that ensure a unique visual experience. For power, the handset ships with a non-removable Li-Ion 2,716mAh battery which can last longer than most devices which have been a trademark of Apple smartphones.. The Apple iPhone X runs the iOS 11 operating system out of the box. The latest OS features Animoji in iMessage that's animated, 3D emojis. For connectivity, there are options like 4G , Bluetooth 5.0, GPS, NFC, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, and a USB 2.0 reversible connector..

Posted on: February 11th, 2018 by Qpang. My parents bought this new Iphone X as my Christmas gift, which means I have used this Iphone X for more than two mouth. After I get familiar with all the features of this Iphone X, I can totally make an objective review now. Appearance The appearance of Iphone X is astonishing. I have to admit that the full-screen design used in Iphone X is genius. It make Iphone X not only visually appealing but also outstanding comparing to other Iphones. Traditional Features Traditional features like picture viewing, music, and camera still maintain the characteristics that Apple’s products used to have. Photo taking is the best among all the smart phones. The user do not need to be worried about picture stretching because of the double camera. It also can even change different lights and modes when taking photos. After all, the quality of the photos taken by Iphone X is almost the same as a simple SLR camera. The screen and picture viewing are almost perfect. The light sent out by the screen is smooth and relaxing. After staring at the Iphone X’s screen for a long time, your eyes will not get tired as staring other smart phones and electronic product. When I just get this Iphone X, I was in trouble with choosing home screen picture because all the pictures looks appealing in Iphone X’s screen. Using Iphone X to listen to music is also relaxing. The sound is smooth and easy to breakthrough rooms. Because of the sounding system of this Iphone X, I start to take my headphone every time I go out. Face ID & Animoji Face ID and Animoji are the two newest features introduced in Iphone X. Both of them are based on a camera analyzing users’ faces. For Face ID, users do not need to input password to unlock the screen, instead, they only need to stare at the screen for half second. Animoji also use this kind of camera to stimulate your face expression into different emojis. Based on my experience, Animoji is funny and make texting more fun. It can easily recognize your face without a mistake. However, this feature actually is a little bit of annoying. The Iphone X only encourage their user to set Face ID as the way to unlock screen. If you do not use Face ID to unlock screen, the information of your lock screen notifications are easily to be exposed. I recommend this smart phone to everybody, especially those who use smart phone very often and love to use smart phone to take pictures and selfies. I know the price of Iphone X is hard to accept, but it is totally worth it if you wish to use a perfect smart phone.. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of PhoneDog.com.

The IPhone X is a great phone, but for being an all screen phone something that Apple is new too, they have some bugs to workout, not a lot of major issues, but when on a call and trying to do other things it gets a little laggy, besides that the phone has done amazing with a few of my test, the camera is one of the best i have come across, the live pictures are pretty cool, but the phone is glitchy, just a few things Apple needs to work on, nothing big.. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of PhoneDog.com. Would Recommend to a friend.. I love my iPhone x more than I ever thought I would. Posted on: January 20th, 2018 by trishk. The reception not so much, but I know that is the fault of Verizon, because we have never gotten good reception where we live. The notch doesn't bother me, though I suppose it would be cooler without. What I love about the X is the feel of the phone. It feels like silk under my fingers, as I shift from app to app to off to on. Everything is smooth; there are no abrupt movements, no clicks or stops. I feel like I am using a machine from science fiction, not a mechanical object. Because of that, the X is addictive. I might not even want to look something up, send an email or text or, god forbid, answer the phone. I just want to feel my fingers sliding across the smooth, lovely glass. It is even more surreal when I use the Airpods with it. Now it magically sends signals to my ears. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of PhoneDog.com.

After having the phone for About a month, I’ve fallen in love with it, the a11 chip is incredible and the phone is really fast, one look and it’s unlocked, I upgraded from the iPhone 6S and I love how the size of my phone is just a little bit bigger but the screen is so much larger! The speakers are incredible and I love that I don’t have to worry about getting it wet, I don’t really miss my headphone jack at all, sometimes when I do need To listen to something with earbuds I have wireless earbuds, for those who use one set of earbuds often, I suggest tapping the dongle to the headphones, all in all don’t listen to all that crap on YouTube if this phone is in your budget then I 100% recommend it, if you want the same specs for a bit cheaper, then go for the 8+ is almost the same just without the bells and whistles.

If I was going from a 7, this review may be different. I am upgrading from the iPhone 7 Plus and although the screen is technically bigger, it is oddly shaped and a lot of the screen in apps remains unused. Face recognition is great and works quickly, and the phone also has screen recording which I like. But overall, I miss my Plus and will be switching the the 8 Plus and getting rid of this as soon as possible.. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of PhoneDog.com.

The X is slow, the screen lags ALOT and it crashes off of apps now and again. If this is what happens 3weeks into my purchase then it’s definitely going back! I had the 7 and wished I never upgraded! What a rip off.. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of PhoneDog.com. Would Recommend to a friend.. Posted on: December 7th, 2017 by Glenn. I have owned every iPhone except for the 8, since the x came out so close together, & this has to be the icing on the cake, the champagne of all, the cherry to, take the prize!!! Every thing from face recognition, to anti smear, anti reflection, bottom flip to close screens, size, full glass screen, camera, battery life, siri, phone not getting hot while being used, make this the best iPhone ever!!!!! Apple has outdone itself, yet again!!! The only thing missing is, an option to, write texts, with a delivery time, set in the future, so they can be written in one time zone, & sent at a convenient time, to another time zone automatically, at a set time, so people are not disturbed, during inconvenient times, while asleep etc!!! This is an idea for apple to incorporate into their phones, to take delivery of messages, over the top!!! Thanks Apple for revolutionizing the modern phone, & making the world, get so, small!!!!.

Better than expected and better than some of the expert reviews. For example, a popular critic said the phone felt cheap. Nothing can be more from the truth. You feel like you are holding a piece of solid platinum. Best iPhone to date and I have owned every single one since the beginning..

As a fan of both android, and iOS. I would have to say that the iPhone X is by far the best phone I’ve ever had. The screen is amazing and easy on the eyes and I really don’t notice the notch as much. Battery life on this bad boy is unbelieveable! Coming from the 7 plus, it’s a big difference. Face ID is the ish!!! All I have todo is look at the phone for notices to appear, and unlocking is quick and easy. The iPhone X is all around an amazing device and if you want a big screen that still fits in your hand, this is the phone!. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of PhoneDog.com.

I received the iPhone X on release day. After 2 days, I can honestly say I don’t miss the previous design. The X is a beautifully designed, easy to navigate phone. iPhone users it’s been ingrained in us to use the Home button. But after 10 minutes on the X, the swiping gestures feel natural. I’m glad the iconic Home button is gone! And what’s up with this stupid notch thing everyone is complaining about? I literally had to google it. I see a black border which is part of the screen. I think it’s aesthetically pleasing and fits the design perfectly. When you hold the X, you feel how well built it is. This wasn’t designed with cheap materials. It reminds me of the 4 in terms of weight. Also with anything new, there will be little glitches here and there just like all the other brands. But as flagship iPhone, this is a perfect start! Apple will do what Apple does, which is build upon and perfect! The crisp and sharp display is gorgeous. The battery is also really good but I don’t run a ton of apps like most kids today. The reception is great as well! The calls aren’t breaking up. That’s partly due to the carrier I have and area I live in. I can honestly say when I heard the price tag I said out loud, “there is no way in hell I’m paying that price!” But I’ve been longing for a completely new iPhone design. In my opinion, it was money well spent! Thank you Apple! Keep moving forward and continue to be unique!. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of PhoneDog.com.

Camera, A11 Bionic chip, and AR. 10th anniversary Apple iPhone is here, and it’s called the iPhone X (pronounced “iPhone Ten”). The Cupertino, California-based company made it official at. an event on the Apple Campus in the Steve Jobs Theater — and in our iPhone X review , we call. Indeed, Apple CEO Tim Cook called the new iPhone X “the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone,” and it’s easy to see why. The OLED display — an iPhone first — is called the Super Retina Display and measures 5.8 inches, with a resolution of 2,436 ×. It features Dolby Vision and HDR10. for stunning high-contrast video playback, as well as TrueTone dynamic white-balance adjustment, a feature of the 10.5-inch iPad Pro. and the new iPhone 8. The screen takes up the whole screen and there’s no home button — you unlock your phone with your face. Oh, and it’s water- and dust-resistant, and capable of charging wirelessly.. iPhone X pre-orders are slated to deliver on November 3, but many people found themselves having to wait until the end of November or December to receive one. It looks like Christmas came early, though, as The Verge confirms there are multiple reports of shipping estimates moving up as early as November 6. You should check your shipping estimate from Apple to see if your device is arriving sooner.. The iPhone X costs $1,000, and it’s available in limited stock at Apple stores, carriers, and retailers on November 3. You can nab one in either 64GB or 256GB, but the latter will cost $1,150. If you’re planning on picking one up at a store, Apple recommends arriving early — you may want to consider waiting on line the night before or early in the morning.. Some carriers, like Sprint, are cutting customers a discount. New and existing customers on the carrier’s Sprint Flex plan will be able to get a 64GB iPhone for $22.22 per month for 18 months ($400) with an eligible trade-in. For a full list of iPhone X prices and pre-order information, check out our iPhone X. The iPhone X was the third phone announced by Apple on September 12, joining the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Apple Watch , which comes with built-in cellular connectivity.. Apple released a support document about the iPhone X’s OLED display. The document states users may see slight shifts in color when looking at the screen from an angle. Apple also warned that users may experience screen burn-in with extended use of the phone.. But most recently, DisplayMate — the company that makes professional-grade software for display calibration — published its detailed results for the iPhone X. According to its testing, the iPhone X has the best smartphone display on the market. Based on lab tests and measurements, the device earned DisplayMate’s A-plus rating — which is the highest ever. The results noted that the X had close to “textbook perfect calibration and performance,” along with the highest absolute color accuracy, highest full-screen brightness for OLED smartphones, among others.. With the iPhone X pre-orders now live, MacRumors spotted that Apple released pricing information about the phone’s repairs. In the U.S., Apple will charge you a flat rate of $280 for iPhone X screen repairs and $550 for any other damages. If it’s a manufacturing defect, then it’s covered by Apple’s standard one-year warranty.. Pricing also varies depending what country you’re in:. But these prices are only applicable to those who don’t purchase AppleCare+ for the iPhone X. AppleCare+ is optional, but it extends an iPhone’s coverage to two years based on the original purchase date of the device. If you decide to purchase the extended warranty plan, then screen repairs will only cost you $30 and any other damages will be $100.. Apple will sell the iPhone X in 55 countries around the world. The iPhone X’s Face ID sensor is reportedly taking more time to assemble than expected, according to The Wall Street Journal, contributing to shipping delays. The problem lies in an “imbalance” between the so-called Romeo module, an infrared dot projector that beams more than 30,000 invisible dots to create a depth map of faces, and the Juliet module, which analyzes the pattern produced by those dots.. to Bloomberg , it was earlier this fall that Apple realized production problems meant it wouldn’t have enough iPhone Xs for the holidays. Sources familiar to the situation say Apple’s solution was reportedly to let suppliers reduce the accuracy of the iPhone X’s Face ID feature. Lowering the requirements for its Face ID technology would permit the firm to speed up production. The change also means that it takes less time to test completed modules. But it’s still unclear how these changes will decrease the technology’s efficacy.. Following Bloomberg’s detailed report on Face ID accuracy being reduced, Apple responded to the claim. The company’s spokeswoman Trudy Muller said, “Bloomberg’s claim. that it reduced the accuracy spec for Face ID is completely false and we expect Face ID to be the new gold standard for facial authentication.” Muller also assured users that both quality and accuracy of Face ID remains the same, and the chance of someone other than you unlocking your phone is still one in a million.. The iPhone X’s camera has a dual-lens 12-megapixel rear camera with dual optical image stabilization, consisting up of a wide-angle f/1.8 aperture lens and a telephoto f/2.4 aperture lens. The 7-megapixel front camera supports Portrait mode and has auto image stabilization and exposure control. Apple’s new image signal processor provides advanced pixel processing and a new color filter, and both cameras use the new Natural Lighting effect introduced on the iPhone 8 and ARKit augmented reality features. Finally, video has also been improved with 4K resolution movies at 60fps and slow-motion video at 240fps.. DxOMark — a website focused on assessing image quality for mobile phones, lenses, and camera sensors — recently evaluated the iPhone X. The site released its results , which indicate the device received an overall score of 97 out of 100 — the second-highest score in the DxOMark Mobile overall ranking. With the best Photo sub-score so far — 101 points — results stated the iPhone X is the top performer for stills. In comparison to the iPhone 8 Plus , DxOMark specifically pointed out the iPhone X’s improved telephoto lens led to higher results in Zoom, Exposure, Noise, Texture, and Artifacts.. The iPhone X retains the A11 Bionic chip from the iPhone 8, a 64-bit super efficient processor with a new Apple-designed graphics unit, which has 30 percent more speed than the existing unit. It has six cores and better performance than the A10 Fusion chip, and while Apple typically doesn’t publish RAM specifications, filings from China electronics regulator TENNA show the iPhone X has 3GB of RAM. Apple says the high-performance cores to provide a 25-percent speed increase and a 70 percent boost from the four performance cores.. Regarding battery life, the iPhone X lasts about two hours longer than the iPhone 7 Plus. Chinese electronics regulator Tenaa’s filings , the iPhone X’s has a 2,716mAh battery, which isn’t far off from the iPhone 7 Plus’s 2,900mAh. It supports wireless charging via Qi-compatible accessories, and Apple will introduce a proprietary charging solution called AirPower early next year.. Apple’s new facial recognition technology, Face ID, makes its debut on the iPhone X. It works using the TrueDepth camera system hidden in the notch at the top of the display. Glance at the iPhone X and it illuminates your face with an infrared dot array, allowing the infrared camera to identify it. It even works in the dark. Using the iPhone X’s six-core A11 Bionic processor paired with 3GB of RAM, a neural engine processes the image in real time, mapping the contours and shape of your face mathematically.. Apple claims Face ID isn’t confused by hairstyles, hats, or beards. According to Apple software chief Craig Federighi, the iPhone will be able to recognize your face through “most” sunglasses, too, as long as they let through enough infrared light. Protections against masks and pictures are in place, and face data is stored in the secure enclave inside the A11 Bionic chip.. Don’t worry about Face ID being less secure than other biometric systems; it’s not. The chance of someone other than you unlocking your phone with Touch ID is one in 50,000, Apple says, but for Face ID it’s one in a million. requires you to look at the phone when you go to pay, and it works with existing apps that use Touch ID for authentication.. On top of that, Apple has implemented some software protections against people stealing your phone and just holding it to your face to unlock it. For starters, if you don’t stare at the phone itself, it won’t unlock. And if you grip the buttons on both edges of the phone, the device will temporarily disable facial recognition.. If you remember when Apple first implemented Touch ID, you’ll remember some bumps and bugs at first — but many of those bugs shouldn’t exist with Face ID. In fact, developers won’t even have to worry about implementing it — if an app uses Touch ID, it will automatically also use Face ID.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. I’ve been using the new Apple iPhone X since I first got my hands on it on October 23. I had some issues at first along with many positive responses, but it has been my only driver for seven weeks now.. Since supply of the expensive, king-of-the-hill, top-of-the-heap iPhone has now become much more readily accessible – and way faster than was initially thought – this seems like a good time to report on what I’ve found.. The Mid-Term is my occasional column, reviewing a product I've been testing consistently for a long time. It's for a product which I've put through its paces for weeks or even months, so you can be sure the results are reliable, especially compared to some other reviews, written after just a day or so of use.... The lock screen of the iPhone X. Note the padlock icon which swings satisfyingly open when FaceID recognizes it's you.. It’s so speedy, effective and reliable. I thought I’d regret losing the intimacy of Touch ID. I worried it wouldn’t work – as facial recognition on some other phones has been less than consistent – and that it wouldn’t feel as intimate or seamless. I realized this when I found myself raising an eyebrow, Roger Moore-style to try and catch it out. It worked perfectly but I suddenly thought, ‘Oh no, I just flirted with my iPhone. What’s next, asking Siri on a date?’ Some have said it’s not as fast as Touch ID but I haven’t found that.. And one of the very best features on the iPhone X is the way that Face ID keeps my notifications private until it recognizes that it’s me looking at the screen. That, and the way it dials down the ringtone volume when it sees I’m looking at it and so knows it has my attention, are brilliant details which make using the phone a wholly intimate experience.. It doesn’t recognize me if I’m brushing my teeth, say, because it needs to see my eyes, nose and mouth to be sure it’s me. And those occasional moments when it the little padlock shakes its head no when it doesn’t quite see me right, though pretty rare, are always dispiriting. Thought: am I getting too emotionally involved with my cellphone?. Face ID on the new Apple iPhone X.. 2 Face ID: Security and Apple Pay. Touch ID for Apple Pay is a highly satisfying way to use a contactless card reader. But it does mean you have to hold your iPhone so that your thumb is right down at the base of the handset which isn’t always the easiest to balance. Face ID sorts this because you can hold the phone more comfortably as you double-press the side button.. I thought I wouldn’t care for the fact that I have to double-press a button to activate Apple Pay. More work, I thought, though I grant you, this is an issue you can file under first world problems.. But it turns out that on many occasions I was pre-arming the system anyway. And I have plenty of friends who have never used Apple Pay because they press on the Touch ID sensor rather than resting a finger on it, causing Siri to activate and have given up on using it. For them, and many others, this will be a much better system.. The shiny edge to the iPhone X in the shape of the polished stainless steel antenna band looks spiffy and the glass back, which I’d come to like on the iPhone 8, looks its best here thanks to a warmer silver color than on the smaller phone.. The most divisive part of the X’s design is that notch at the top of the display. At first, it’s true, it jarred, but after the first week, I honestly failed to notice it apart from when I was viewing a movie, say. As more and more apps are optimized for the iPhone X screen, this distraction is becoming increasingly unimportant.. Part of the new iPhone X interface: no Home Button means a whole new way of operating the iPhone.. The new interface is enjoyable and, now I have shifted over to it, seems more intuitive than what came before. I especially like the fact that swiping down from the top of the screen to reach the Notification Center is made easier by that notch at the top. And I now understand why that screen doesn’t have a search bar on it – where it would sit is where the padlock icon appears to show if the iPhone X is locked or unlocked.. But it wasn’t an instant shift. I got used to swiping up to unlock instantly, but swiping up to return to the home screen was harder. And even now I occasionally go to swipe up to reach the Control Center instead of swiping down from the right ear. And, by the way, I would still like a search bar on the Notification Center screen.. Apple iPhone X with its big-display-on-a-small-phone combination.. A screen bigger than the iPhone 8 Plus in a gadget scarcely bigger than the iPhone 8 is a phenomenal achievement and is something I’m still cooing about. It’s a brilliant fit in the hand in the way that the Plus phones sometimes seemed a stretch, but there’s no screen compromise as a result. The trade-off is that the display is longer and narrower than I’m used to, so that’s taken a while to get used to. I’m there now, but at first I worried that documents would be too small to easily read. They’re not, not least because the screen resolution is so high that text is sharper even when smaller. The bright, vivid screen on the iPhone X.. The colors! The brightness! The detail! This is a phenomenal screen, and the best OLED display I’ve come across, helped along by that Apple specialty True Tone and other technologies like Night Shift, which add to color fidelity beautifully.. But it’s still true that if you turn the phone so you’re looking at it off-axis, the colors on screen tend more towards blue. Here True Tone probably emphasizes the color change all the more. Other OLED screens do this, it’s a characteristic of the technology, and it’s not a deal-breaker but it’s still pretty noticeable.. iPhone X and the rear camera.. The joys of Portrait Lighting are better realized here than on other iPhones and the pleasures of having dual rear cameras on a smaller-in-the-hand iPhone cannot be overstated. I think the camera is the best yet on an iPhone, but it’s true that the snapper on the iPhone 8 Plus is very nearly as good.. No, there’s not much to dislike about the camera. It’s fast, effective and works better than most cameras out there.. The range of characters, the way the dog’s ears and the chicken’s wattles wobble as you tip your head. The way you can do the Roger Moore eyebrow twists I use for unlocking to much greater effect here, and the fact that you can share them with non-iPhone X users. What’s the plural, Animoji or Animojis? I prefer without the S but, oh, it’s so difficult to know. Oh, and Apple, can we have even more characters to choose from, please?. Apple iPhone X on the Belkin Boost Up 7.5W Wireless Charging Pad.. If I’m continually answering the phone or changing the track I’m playing or checking something else out on the phone, I love not having to unplug the iPhone each time. And now I can listen to music on wired headphones while charging.. Maybe it’s me, but I’ve been caught out by placing the phone badly on the charging pad, only to find in the morning that it’s not charged at all. I’m more careful now and to be fair this is a problem with the pad more than Apple, I dare say. Of course, you can still charge the iPhone X the regular way through the Lightning socket.. Apple iPhone X in silver with rear cameras in vertical arrangement.. It gets me through the day, no problem. And if I’ve been topping up via my charging pad, I have plenty of peace of mind that I’m not going to run out of juice, too. But I wish the battery percentage indicator was on the display all the time, still. I’m sure plenty of people don’t miss it, but I do. Sure, I can swipe down to see whether I’m on 64% or 52% charge, because it’s not always that evident from the battery icon, but I just like to know. Still if that’s my biggest gripe with the new phone, and it is, maybe it’s evidence that the iPhone X is a heck of a phone.. Apple's iPhone X - note the white bar on the bottom of the display. Swipe right or left to access other open apps without returning to the home screen in between.. I've reviewed a lot of smartphones over the last decade and this is the standout. It is a gorgeous, slick, powerful phone that works brilliantly and at speed. Over the weeks I've had with it, it has been unfailingly efficient and increasingly delightful, matching reliable performance with knockout features and, of course, a dazzling, show-stopping design. Is it the best phone I've ever used? Well, there are plenty of others that come close, like the Samsung Note8, for instance, but the iPhone X unquestionably puts Apple decisively ahead, leaving its rivals behind by a country mile..

CNET también está disponible en español.. The best iPhone challenges you to think different. Apple iPhone X (64GB, Space Gray). Apple iPhone X (256GB, Space Gray). CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good A great blend of handheld comfort and a big, gorgeous OLED screen. Rear telephoto camera outshoots the 8 Plus in low light, and the front camera snaps impressive portrait selfies. The Bad New interface and no home button mean major adjustments, and key features such as the Control Center are harder to reach and use. It’ll take time for most apps to be optimized for notched screen. The phone is hella expensive, and the all-glass design means a case and an insurance plan are musts. Shorter battery life than iPhone Plus models.. The Bottom Line iPhone X is an overdue and winning evolution of the iPhone, but you’ll need to leave your comfort zone to make a jump into the face-recognizing future.. Weeks later: It feels great to hold, but Face ID can feel slow. The iPhone's biggest ever design change. A closer look at that screen. Face ID and that depth-sensing front camera. I came home late from my first day of testing the iPhone X. My wife sent me audio clips over iMessage from the kids after I sent them pictures of myself, now beardless. In the mirror, I looked smooth, like another version of me. I had shaved my beard to test Face ID , Apple's new method for unlocking your iPhone by simply looking at it. But, what would it be like in public, on TV, when I hug my kids? At first, big personal changes feel uncomfortable but appealing. Everything seems different but also potentially refreshing.. My smooth face was the perfect metaphor for my experience with the iPhone X, which -- starting at $999, £999 or AU$1,579 -- is Apple's most expensive iPhone ever. The 10-year anniversary iPhone feels the same, but different. I've been alternating between both feelings over the last couple of weeks. And you, future iPhone X owner, might feel the same. But tough it out -- because after a few days, you're probably going to like where you end up.. This review has been updated with detailed battery testing information. The addition of the battery rating has slightly adjusted the overall rating from 9.0 to 8.9 (still 4.5 stars). The review also includes November 14 updates that added more additional information on durability and waterproofing tests, camera testing and general usage. You can also check out our earlier impressions of the iPhone X .. After another week of living with the iPhone X as my main everyday phone, its size and design have won me over in lots of ways. But the Face ID phone unlock process still feels labor-intensive compared to Touch ID iPhones. Sometimes it doesn't unlock quickly, and sometimes it just doesn't work. And, as I expected, the new gestures are taking a while to gel. Getting to Control Center is now a two-handed operation that's flat-out annoying. But I'm fine with the flick-up home gesture and have gotten so used to it that I've started to try it on other iPhones and iPads, where it doesn't work.. I haven't been so happy with the size and shape of an iPhone since the iPhone 5. The nearly all-screen feel, when used properly by optimized apps, is fantastic. It feels new, and some elements of the interface, like an improved way to swipe and swap apps, are a big step forward.. But I'd still like the new gestural language to be smoothed out a bit. Now that the home button is gone, its core functions have been spread around. The iPhone X feels like an open door to possibilities that iOS has barely begun to explore.. CNET drop-tested the iPhone X, and it. In fact, it cracked at a single three-foot drop. Gadget warranty company SquareTrade had a similar experience. in its tests , dubbing the X "most breakable iPhone we've ever tested.". With the notable exceptions of the. Droid Turbo 2 -- which, in everyday usage, really do live up to their. "shatterproof" reputation -- the possibility of a broken screen is an occupational hazard for any phone owner. But the relative fragility of the iPhone X is made worse by the fact that repair costs for the device's screen are Apple's highest ever: $279, £286 or AU$419. If you need something other than the screen fixed -- including the equally breakable glass back -- that will cost you a whopping $549, £556 or AU$819. It all means that you should absolutely be using a case (check out our list of. You should also strongly consider investing in. an insurance or third-party warranty plan , such as AppleCare Plus or a wireless carrier policy.. The iPhone X is also water resistant, just like the 7, 7 Plus, 8 and 8 Plus. The X fared fine in our bucket immersion test for a hair under 30 minutes, which is the technical limit of its. But the water resistance is really designed to survive quick accidental dunks, splashes, rain and snow. The standard warranty doesn't cover water damage (though the above-mentioned insurance plans often do so), and the phone is not designed to be immersed in salt water or chlorinated swimming pools.. The basic pitch for the iPhone X is this: Take the iPhone 8 Plus ( $526.40 at Amazon.com ) and cram all of its features into a body that's closer to the size of the iPhone 8. Add Face ID but subtract the Touch ID home button, a casualty of the new, nearly all-screen design. To be clear, except for that home button -- and Touch ID -- all of the other iPhone 8 Plus features are here, including a blazing fast six-core A11 Bionic processor, water-resistance and -- unfortunately -- no headphone jack. The iPhone X also boasts dual rear cameras which are even a bit better than the already superb ones on the Plus. (More on that later.) Wireless charging is on board too, as is the glass-backed design needed to enable it. Yes, you'll need a good case. And you should strongly consider Apple Care Plus, because repair costs for smashed front or rear glass on the iPhone X are exorbitant .. Of course, Apple is charging a hefty premium for its most sophisticated-ever iPhone, too: $999, £999 or AU$1,579 for 64GB. Or step up to $1,149; £1,149 or AU$1,829 for the 256GB version.. Yes, the iPhone X changes the look and function of the iPhone. Before the X, the iPhone design was frozen for years: Home button at the bottom, thick bezels above and below the screen. iOS made some subtle changes over the years, but losing the home button completely shifts the definition of an iPhone.. But while the 5.8-inch display on the iPhone X dwarfs the 4.7-inch screen on the iPhone 8 , it doesn't mean the X's display is "bigger" than the iPhone 8 Plus' 5.5-inch screen. That's because they're shaped differently: The 8 and 8 Plus have the same 16:9 aspect ratio as your TV, while the X is more like 19:9 -- it's taller and wider than the 8, 7, 6S and 6.. In the end, the Plus may still work better bet for larger documents and stand as the best canvas for Apple's giant iOS game collection compared to the narrower X -- but returning to the 8 Plus feels like going back to a (smaller) iPad Mini ( $332.05 at Amazon.com ) by comparison. The X acknowledges that the Plus iPhones were a bit too big, that this new design is just right. It splits the difference, saying, "here's the bigger-screened phone, but it still feels nice in your hand." At long last, it's a Goldilocks design that fits right in the middle.. The infamous notch above the X's display, which cuts out a small chunk of the upper screen to make room for the phone's front-facing camera and sensors, doesn't impact many apps or videos. In fact most I've tried put any critical info below that notch by default. But that does mean the effective display area is even smaller, with black bars on the top and bottom (in portrait mode) or on the sides (in landscape mode).. The 8 Plus (above) and iPhone X (below) playing the same video.. At 458 pixels per inch, the Super Retina display resolution on the iPhone X is technically more crisp than that of the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8 (401 and 326 ppi, respectively). The new OLED display -- the first in an Apple iPhone -- has beautiful perfect black levels and excellent color. It feels brighter than both previous iPhones and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 ( $900.00 at Amazon.com ) , and it's demonstrably better than the muted colors you'll find on the Pixel 2 XL ( $849.99 at Best Buy ) .. — Scott Stein (@jetscott) November 1, 2017. First real night of sleep since Monday, waking up with iPhone X in morning. OLED in dark looks really nice. It's a fantastic viewing experience overall. But there's one big reason to temper your expectations: Apple's LCD screens on previous phones are already so great that you actually may not notice much of a difference.. In addition to the a microphone (for ambient noise), speaker and ambient light sensor you'd find on other phones, it houses an infrared camera, "flood illuminator" and a dot projector and the 7-megapixel selfie camera. Collectively, Apple calls these imaging portions the "TrueDepth camera system.". TrueDepth enables the iPhone X's signature feature: Face ID. It's like a mini Microsoft Kinect -- yes, Apple bought the company that developed that Xbox accessory back in 2013 -- using your face as the authenticator to unlock the phone and for any transactions or passwords. It totally replaces Touch ID -- Apple's fingerprint reader.is nowhere to be found on iPhone X. with your face feels weird at first, but I've come to love how automatically it fills in username and password data on apps and Web pages. It's starting to feel like a far more automatic future.. Face ID was the biggest "what if" for the iPhone X, but the good news is that it performs very well. It recognized me with my beard and without, with glasses and without, with sunglasses and even in total darkness. (The infrared camera is doing the heavy lifting, not the selfie camera.) It didn't unlock for anyone else I tried it with, either.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look..
