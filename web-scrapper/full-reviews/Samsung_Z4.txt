Samsung Z4: Everything you need to know. The $90 Samsung Z4 will save you money but won't come with Android. Where to buy the Samsung Z4. Samsung has announced the Z4 , its latest smartphone with the Tizen operating system onboard, rather than Google Android software it uses on the Galaxy S8 and most of its other phones. Tizen is its in-house, open-source operating system, and version 3.0 was released at the beginning of the year. The Samsung Z4 is the first phone to use it. Don’t expect the Z4 to challenge the Galaxy S8 though. It’s described as a device for, “first time smartphone users,” by Samsung’s mobile president DJ Koh, due to its ease of use and low cost.. Here’s everything you need to know about it.. Sure enough, the Z4 isn’t a massive powerhouse. The screen — which is covered in a curved 2.5D glass panel, an unusual feature at this price — measures 4.5 inches and has a 480 x 800 pixel resolution, smaller and lower resolution than early rumors predicted, while the processor is an unnamed 1.5GHz quad-core chip. It’s accompanied by 1GB of RAM, 8GB of internal storage space, and a MicroSD card slot for cards up to 128GB capacity.. It has a pair of cameras, both of which have 5 megapixels and an f/2.2 aperture, plus a collection of fun camera modes. Interestingly, both have flash units — a dual LED flash on the back, and a single LED flash on the selfie camera around the front. There’s good news on the connectivity front, as the Z4 has 4G LTE, VoLTE, and even VoWiFi if it’s available on the chosen network.. The 143-gram device has a 2,050mAh battery inside, and will come in either single-SIM or dual-SIM configurations, depending on where it’s released. Samsung will sell the Z4 in black, gold, and silver color schemes.. What about Tizen 3.0 — what’s new inside? The bulk of Tizen 3.0’s new features focus on performance. developer notes , the update packs Khronos’ Vulkan graphics API, which minimizes overhead and reduces CPU load, and the speedy open-source web runtime Crosswalk. support for 64-bit Intel and ARM CPUs, too, which Samsung says should boost CPU-intensive apps like video editors and games.. That’s not all that’s new in Tizen 3.0. supports multiple users on a single device, and voice commands via S Voice. new recognition APIs support facial detection and image recognition. Samsung’s also improved Tizen’s security features. It introduces a “new security model” that simplifies “policy management,” an “anti-virus framework” and “privacy guard” that aim to ensure rogue applications don’t gain access to personal information.. That’s encouraging news in light of an April report that said Tizen contains as many as 40 unknown bugs, or zero-days, that could allow a cyber criminal to hack devices without needing to physically access them. One vulnerability involving TizenStore, Tizen’s app store, could let a hacker pack malicious code in a software update. In response to the report, Samsung said it was. And based on what we’ve seen of Tizen 3.0, that certainly seems to be the case.. What makes the Z4 and Tizen 3.0 easy to use? Samsung says it’s easy to add shortcuts to frequently used features, which can be activated without returning to the home screen. These include call features, the torch app, and music functions. A battery manager helps stretch out standby time by letting you tailor power consumption needs to your expected use. Additionally, gesture recognition and voice control features for the camera.. Samsung’s Tizen phones are primarily aimed at developing markets, where its Galaxy Android phones are often prohibitively expensive. The Z4 has been announced for India , where it will go on sale May 19, at an equivalent local cost of around $90. Additional markets will be confirmed in the future, but don’t expect the U.S. Updated on May 15 by Andy Boxall: Added in official news of the Z4, its price, and specifications..

Samsung Z4 Tizen 3.0-Powered Smartphone With 4.5-Inch Display Launched, Coming First to India. Shekhar Thakran , 12 May 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The phone is powered by a 1.5GHz quad-core processor. The phone packs 1GB of RAM. Samsung Z4 houses a 2050mAh battery. Samsung on Friday launched its newest Tizen-powered smartphone - the Samsung Z4 - and it runs on Tizen 3.0 OS. The smartphone will be launched in select markets across the world, starting with India in May. The Samsung Z4 will be made available in Black, Gold, and Silver colour variants depending on the market. For now, the company has not detailed the Samsung Z4 price or its exact launch date.. The most interesting aspect about the new phone from Samsung is its camera department. The Samsung Z4 comes with a 5-megapixel rear camera with dual-LED flash support and at front it features a 5-megapixel sensor with f/2.2 aperture and LED flash support. The company claims that both front and rear cameras on Samsung Z4 are "optimised for social media" and offer features focused on convenience and creativity. The rear flash module also appears to be shaped similar to the Smart Glow notification system unveiled with the Samsung Galaxy J2 (2016) .. The Samsung Z4 will be made available in both single and dual-SIM variants depending on the market. It sports a 4.5-inch WVGA (480x800 pixels) display with 2.5D curved glass on top, which the company says is a first for its Z-Series Tizen smartphones. It is powered by a 1.5GHz quad-core processor coupled with 1GB of RAM.. While Samsung is yet to detail the inbuilt storage offered by the device, the connectivity options offered by Samsung Z4 include 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, USB 2.0, GPS, and Glonass. The smartphone houses a 2050mAh battery. The Samsung Z4 measures 132.9x69.2x10.3mm and weighs 143 grams.. "We're dedicated to providing our customers with devices that offer smarter mobile interactions," DJ Koh, president of mobile communications business at Samsung Electronics, was quoted as saying in the company's release. "The Samsung Z4 brings a simplified mobile experience to first time smartphone users and represents our ongoing commitment to expanding the Tizen ecosystem," Koh said.. As the name indicates, the Samsung Z4 is the fourth smartphone in Samsung Z series. However, it cannot be called the successor the Samsung Z3. The South Korean giant has muddled the naming scheme, at least in terms of chronology. The first Samsung Tizen smartphone to have been unveiled was the Samsung Z , however, that never hit markets. Next, was the Samsung Z1 , which was launched in January 2015. Next, strangely enough, was the Samsung Z3 , unveiled in October 2015. Finally, we got the Samsung Z2 , which was unveiled in August 2016 .. For the latest tech news and reviews , follow Gadgets 360 on Twitter , Facebook , and subscribe to our YouTube channel ..

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Samsung has announced the Z4 smartphone runningÂ. the company’s own Tizen 3.0 operating system. It’s an entry-level device that sports a 4.5-inch display (800 x 480 pixels) with 2.5D curved glass on top and is powered by an unspecified quad-core processor clocked at 1.5 GHz. The interesting part though is not the specs, but that it’s an Android challenger targeted at developing markets.. only has 1 GB of RAM and comes equipped with a 5 MP primary camera with an f/2.2Â. The front-facing selfie snapper also has a 5 MP sensor with LED flash, which comes in handy when taking selfies in low-light conditions. The camera comes with a few nifty features, as it allows you to take a photo by showing your palm and smiling. You can also use the Auto Selfie feature that will snap an image with the help of facial recognition.. Some of the other features of the smartphone include a 2,500 mAh battery, dual SIM support (in some countries), and 4G connectivity. The Samsung Z4 will go on sale sometime this month in select markets, starting in India. Youâll be able to choose from a few different colors including gold, silver, and black. Not all of them will be available in every market though. The device will also be showcased at the Tizen Developer Conference, which kicks off on May 16 in San Francisco.. As you know, the vast majority of smartphones Samsung sells run Android. But the company has demonstrated time and again that it wants to reduce its reliance on Google, which is why itâs still working on its own Tizen OS. Tizen is quite popular when it comes to smartwatches and has actually surpassed Android Wear during the first quarter of the year in terms of market share.. But when it comes to smartphones, Tizen is still WAY behind Android. Pushing out affordable Tizen devices in emerging markets might go some way towards closing the gap, even if only a little. But according to Amihai Neiderman, aÂ. security researcher at Equus Software, Samsungâs operating system does have its share of problems. He found as many as 40 zero-day vulnerabilities in the OS and said that Tizenâs code may be âthe worst heâd ever seenâ.. Please enter a valid email address. Android Authority APP Get it on.

Samsung Z4: Everything you need to know. Samsung Z4 Tizen 3.0 Where to buy the Samsung Z4 Samsung Galaxy S7 vs. Galaxy S8: Is this year’s ‘Next Big Thing’ really worth it? You won’t be saying hello to Bixby on your new Samsung Galaxy S8. Samsung has announced the Z4 , its latest smartphone with the Tizen operating system onboard, rather than Google Android software it uses on the Galaxy S8 and most of its other phones. Tizen is its in-house, open-source operating system, and version 3.0 was released at the beginning of the year. The Samsung Z4 is the first phone to use it. Don’t expect the Z4 to challenge the Galaxy S8 though. It’s described as a device for, “first time smartphone users,” by Samsung’s mobile president DJ Koh, due to its ease of use and low cost.. Here’s everything you need to know about it.. Sure enough, the Z4 isn’t a massive powerhouse. The screen — which is covered in a curved 2.5D glass panel, an unusual feature at this price — measures 4.5 inches and has a 480 x 800 pixel resolution, smaller and lower resolution than early rumors predicted, while the processor is an unnamed 1.5GHz quad-core chip. It’s accompanied by 1GB of RAM, 8GB of internal storage space, and a MicroSD card slot for cards up to 128GB capacity.. It has a pair of cameras, both of which have 5 megapixels and an f/2.2 aperture, plus a collection of fun camera modes. Interestingly, both have flash units — a dual LED flash on the back, and a single LED flash on the selfie camera around the front. There’s good news on the connectivity front, as the Z4 has 4G LTE, VoLTE, and even VoWiFi if it’s available on the chosen network.. The 143-gram device has a 2,050mAh battery inside, and will come in either single-SIM or dual-SIM configurations, depending on where it’s released. Samsung will sell the Z4 in black, gold, and silver color schemes.. What about Tizen 3.0 — what’s new inside? The bulk of Tizen 3.0’s new features focus on performance. developer notes , the update packs Khronos’ Vulkan graphics API, which minimizes overhead and reduces CPU load, and the speedy open-source web runtime Crosswalk. support for 64-bit Intel and ARM CPUs, too, which Samsung says should boost CPU-intensive apps like video editors and games.. That’s not all that’s new in Tizen 3.0. supports multiple users on a single device, and voice commands via S Voice. new recognition APIs support facial detection and image recognition. Samsung’s also improved Tizen’s security features. It introduces a “new security model” that simplifies “policy management,” an “anti-virus framework” and “privacy guard” that aim to ensure rogue applications don’t gain access to personal information.. That’s encouraging news in light of an April report that said Tizen contains as many as 40 unknown bugs, or zero-days, that could allow a cyber criminal to hack devices without needing to physically access them. One vulnerability involving TizenStore, Tizen’s app store, could let a hacker pack malicious code in a software update. In response to the report, Samsung said it was. And based on what we’ve seen of Tizen 3.0, that certainly seems to be the case.. What makes the Z4 and Tizen 3.0 easy to use? Samsung says it’s easy to add shortcuts to frequently used features, which can be activated without returning to the home screen. These include call features, the torch app, and music functions. A battery manager helps stretch out standby time by letting you tailor power consumption needs to your expected use. Additionally, gesture recognition and voice control features for the camera.. Samsung’s Tizen phones are primarily aimed at developing markets, where its Galaxy Android phones are often prohibitively expensive. The Z4 has been announced for India , where it will go on sale May 19, at an equivalent local cost of around $90. Additional markets will be confirmed in the future, but don’t expect the U.S. Updated on May 15 by Andy Boxall: Added in official news of the Z4, its price, and specifications..

Samsung's OS gets a new version, is still tied to ~$100 budget phones.. - May 12, 2017 6:05 pm UTC. The Samsung Z4, a phone to be released in 2017.. This is definitely a cheap phone. The back looks to be plastic.. We're going to guess this is the power button. Up top looks like a fingernail slot to rip the back off, meaning the battery is probably removable.. Samsung says the device has "2.5D" glass, and it sure looks like the side of the glass panel is curved a bit.. Next week, most of the tech press will be focused on Google I/O 2017, Google's big developer conference. But Samsung just happens to be holding its own competing conference at the same time: the Tizen Developer Conference 2017. Here, developers will (supposedly) gather to talk about the latest Tizen OS improvements and development practices. To celebrate, Samsung announced a new flagship Tizen smartphone today, the Samsung Z4 .. While Samsung uses Google's Android OS in nearly all of its smartphones, the company has been building a Linux-based OS of its own, called Tizen, for some time now. Tizen runs on Samsung's smartwatches , fitness devices , TVs, smart appliances, and a tiny handful of smartphones. We reviewed the first-ever Tizen smartphone, the Samsung Z1 , back in 2015, and we weren't impressed. It felt like a hollow copy. of Android without any apps, so why not just run Android? Tizen is apparently not very secure, either , with a security researcher. saying, "It may be the worst code I've ever seen," and "Everything you can do wrong there, they do it." A WikiLeaks data dump even claimed that the CIA can turn Samsung's (Tizen-based) smart TVs. Further Reading The first Tizen smartphone isn’t an “Android killer”—it’s a bad Android clone. Samsung continues to plug away at its operating system, though, and the most interesting part of the Samsung Z4 may be. that it launches with Tizen 3.0, a brand-new version of the OS. Tizen 3.0 comes with support for the new "Vulkan" graphics API, a switch from the X Window System to Wayland (Tizen is. really Linux-based), 64-bit support, multi-user support, Samsung's S-Voice voice assistant, and tons of other features. Despite the recent news, Samsung's Tizen 3.0 page claims, "Security has been one of Tizen’s major strengths." It then goes on to describe a "new security model" in 3.0 that will make managing security policies easier, plus. As the name suggests, the Z4 is the fourth major Tizen phone. it doesn't seem like Tizen hardware has. progressed much since our last review. The Z4 is still an unattractive budget phone, that, like past Tizen models, will probably retail for around $100. It has a 4.5-inch, 800×480 display, an unspecified "Quad core 1.5GHz" processor, 1GB of RAM, 5MP front and rear camera, "USB 2.0" (we're guessing MicroUSB), and a 2050mAh battery.

Home / News / Samsung Z4 review: Another hard to recommend Tizen smartphone. Design Display Camera Software Apps Performance and Audio Quality Battery Life Conclusion Pros Cons Smooth performance considering the hardware Call quality is poor Great battery life Unattractive design Cameras perform well in good lighting Dull display 4G LTE support Tizen still lacks a good app ecosystem Low loudspeaker voulume. I love my job here at SamMobile, and for the past couple of years, the only time I’ve rolled my eyes at something is when I’ve been asked to review Samsung’s Tizen phones. The Korean giant has released four Tizen handsets since 2015, and each has been a strictly budget affair. The lack of apps has no doubt been the biggest issue for me, followed by the fact that these phones have extremely basic specs. Of course, given the sub-$100 price tags, you can’t expect anything else, but reviewing these phones isn’t an easy task, especially if you get to use the much better Android phones from Samsung.. The Samsung Z4 just launched last month as the latest in the company’s Tizen lineup, and with a great deal of willpower, I managed to use it as my primary device for a couple of weeks. The Z4 has the same low-end specs as the Samsung Z2 that launched last year, but as I noted in my hands-on, it carries a higher price tag and has a design that is not as good as the Z2’s. Where the Z4 set itself apart is on the software front – the Z4 is the first Tizen phone to run Tizen 3.0.. Samsung Z2 review: Strictly for first-time smartphone users. Tizen 3.0 isn’t exactly a huge step-up from previous versions as far as user-facing features are concerned, but Samsung has built in a couple of behind-the-scenes upgrades. to make its in-house operating system more technically adept. It’s similar to what Android Marshmallow was to Android Lollipop, so a quick glance at the user interface would make you think this is the same as the one found on existing Tizen phones.. But how is the experience of using the Z4 like? Does it do anything to make Samsung’s Tizen phones a more attractive option for those looking for a new budget phone, or are the low price tag and relatively smooth and quick operating system once again the only highlights? Well, let’s find out in our review.. It will come as no surprise that the Z4 looks exactly like a run-of-the-mill budget phone. It’s also rather thick like the Z2, which, combined with its plastic (removable) back panel, makes for a clunky feel in hand. despite having a display that is 0.5 inches larger than the Z2’s. But where Samsung has taken a noticeable step down from the Z2 is at the back of the phone.. The surprisingly good-looking dotted pattern (especially on the red variant) that we saw on the Z2’s back panel has been replaced by a similar pattern with bigger dots. I’m not sure if this is the result of the increased size of the phone, but at least on the gold variant, it looks rather cheap. Making matters worse is this new pattern for the area surrounding the camera – it has multiple silver lines running outwards from the camera lens, and even if you switch to the black back panel that comes free in the box, this pattern ensures that the cheap look doesn’t go away. Again, for the higher price tag compared to the Z2, it’s disappointing to see.. Like all other Samsung smartphones except the Galaxy S8 and S8+, the Z4 gets the company’s traditional hard home button, which is flanked by menu and back keys. The menu key continues to feel outdated and will be a nuisance from folks used to any recent Android phone, and I’m surprised Samsung hasn’t opted to use a multitasking key to keep the experience similar for those switching from its Android devices to its Tizen phones. Maybe it won’t be too much of a problem for most, as Samsung is targeting first-time smartphone users with Tizen, but it does feel like something from the past when you’re using a Tizen phone.. While the screen size on the Z4 has gone up compared to the Z2, it’s still not as big as the Z3’s 5-inch display. But since the Z4 has a display resolution of 480×800 pixels and has an LCD panel, the viewing experience is rather average. There’s a dull look to everything as if Samsung increased the gamma levels, and colors look boring as well. Pixelation in text is evident thanks to the low resolution. Viewing angles, thankfully, are perfectly fine. The screen’s brightness is also sufficient outside here under the Indian sun, but you have manually increase brightness all the way up to full when you step outside, as there is no auto brightness option.. But for a $90 phone, you can’t expect much, unless you consider the fact that the Z3 with its 5-inch AMOLED display is now available at a price lower than the Z4. It doesn’t have Tizen 3.0, but it likely will get it as an update, while its other specs are similar to the Z4’s. Then again, if the pricing history of previous Tizen devices is anything to go by, the Z4’s price is likely to drop down well below the Z3’s in a couple of months. In any case, the phone has a basic display that gets the job done, but it would have been nice to see a slightly higher screen resolution.. With 5-megapixel shooters at the front and back, the Z4 isn’t geared at taking great photos. Let’s talk about the rear camera first. To be fair, the Z4 doesn’t do bad for a sub-$100 phone with a 5MP sensor. Photos have considerable detail despite the low-resolution sensor, and it’s only when you start zooming in on photos does the softness creep in. Detail is higher in subjects captured up close, although the photos do have a drab look, both on the phone’s display and on a monitor. Just look at the photo of the lotus to see what I mean.. I was impressed by how the HDR mode works on the Z4. You have to enable it manually, and the phone takes around two seconds to save HDR shots, but the end result manages to be quite good. See the sample of the building against the sky down below; the Z4 doesn’t blow out the clouds while maintaining a fair amount of detail on the building. Of course, low-light is where the phone gives up. Focusing on subjects becomes a time-consuming affair, and even when focus does catch on, there is next to no detail. It’s not surprising, though, as shooting in low light is something almost every budget phone fails at, even with higher-resolution sensors.. Check out these samples from the rear camera:. The selfie camera, meanwhile, is just slightly above average. while there might not be a lot of detail, photos don’t come out too soft, either. Indoors and in artificial lighting at night, however, fine detail all but disappears. Thankfully, the LED flash at the front (it’s not an actual flash, but a standard light that stays on until you turn it off) manages to make things slightly better as far as detail is concerned. Colors manage to look somewhat appealing as well, and overall, the front camera isn’t bad for the Z4’s asking price.. Like Samsung’s higher-end phones, the Z4 offers a few ways of capturing selfies without reaching for the shutter button. There’s voice control (which also works for the rear camera), so you can shout out cheese or smile to take a selfie, followed by gesture control, which allows you to hold out your palm in front of the camera to have your picture taken. You can also enable the option to take selfies by tapping anywhere on the screen. Naturally, beauty mode is included; it’s set at 2 by default, so if you aren’t a fan of artificially cleaned up selfies, it is best to set it down to 0.. Samsung has even built in the ability to swipe up and down on the screen to switch between the front and rear camera, another feature that can be seen on its Android devices. Of course, double pressing the home button to launch the camera app works, too. Shooting modes on the rear camera include panorama, beauty face, dream shot, night, continuous shot, picture collage, fast motion, and something called video flip. I’m not sure what video flip does. Videos recorded normally and in video flip mode looked the same to me, and I didn’t spend much time trying to find the difference.. Dream shot lets you put the scene you want to capture in and around different subjects. For example, one template puts the photo you take in the middle of the moon, while another. makes it look like you’re walking out of a tunnel towards the Taj Mahal. It’s funky stuff, and I’m sure some folks will have fun using the various templates available. Other modes do what their names suggest; night mode is useful in really dark conditions, as it does manage to wring out extra light when you need it.. For the front camera, the shooting modes include wide selfie, dream shot, interval shot, picture collage, and video flip. Interval shot is an interesting one here. It takes four selfies at intervals of two seconds, and you can save the best ones of the lot and discard the rest. Meanwhile, wide selfie, which is a panorama mode for the front camera, is useful when you have a group of people that won’t fit in the frame at once.. If you have read our reviews of Samsung’s previous Tizen devices, you are probably aware that Tizen looks quite similar to Samsung’s customized version of Android. But, there are a few differences that set it apart, starting from the home screen. On Tizen, the home screen comprises of a dock with eight app shortcuts, and accessing the app drawer is done by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. The notification shade is the same as on Galaxy phones, showing quick toggles and app notifications when you open it by swiping down from the top of the display. But icons in the status bar are reversed, so you see things like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth icons on the left and icons for app notifications on the right, with the time shown in the middle.. A slew of features that are offered on Galaxy devices is available on Tizen. The list includes stuff like S Bike Mode (read details on how S Bike mode works here ), Private Mode, Ultra Data Saving Mode, and support for themes. Tizen’s theme support is pretty extensive. You can separately change the home screen icons, the wallpaper for the home and lock screen, and match the interface color of inbuilt apps with that of the home screen wallpaper. You can, of course, just switch between themes instead of customizing things manually, and Tizen offers both first-party and third-party themes to choose from. Oh, and a neat touch that Tizen 3.0 brings is that the lock screen wallpaper changes every time you wake up the phone. These wallpapers are tailor-made for India, and in some instances, Samsung offers insight on the wallpaper’s subject. These wallpapers are of high quality, too, and it’s only the low display resolution that lets them down.. Not a lot has changed on Tizen since the Samsung Z2, despite the OS getting a major version upgrade. As said before, most of the changes are under the hood, so for a more detailed look at the software, check out our Samsung Z2 review .. Once again, it is app support that needs to be talked about when we’re talking about Tizen. Well, while things have gotten better over the last couple of years, Tizen still doesn’t offer an app experience anywhere near that of Android. There are quite a few alternatives to popular apps, and first-party versions of popular apps like Facebook and Instagram exist, but none offer the same level of functionality as their Android counterparts. I also found the native Facebook app to have issues. Basically, the app refused to update content for three days straight despite numerous attempts to refresh the feed, and this is likely because of these apps not being properly updated for the newer version of Tizen.. The best third-party app I found was BetterTube for YouTube. It’s a native app that opens YouTube in a browser view but adds numerous features on top, like easy rotation of the video and signing in to and browsing through YouTube. There are also a few official games available, both as native apps and those that emulate the Android versions. The original Angry Birds runs great, and so does this game called Danger Dash, which is pretty much Temple Run in a different setting. Modern Combat 5, one of the most graphically demanding games for Android, also runs well, although there was some issue with textures (things visible through walls, black spots in some places, etc.) Of course, Angry Birds, Plants vs Zombies, and similar titles are rather outdated at this point, but overall, the selection of games on Tizen is pretty good for passing away the time.. Tizen phones are bought by people on a budget, and many of them don’t always have a good data plan at hand. Samsung knows this, and has built in a neat option that lets you save the installation files for apps on the device when you download them from the Tizen store. You can then share these with others, who only need to download 1 percent of the total app from the store. But the thing is, quite a few important apps are still missing on Tizen. There is no Uber app, Google only offers a basic search app, and some apps also run in a basic web format. The lack of Google apps is the worst, as I was severely limited by the things I could do when I used the phone as my primary device.. As we have said before, Tizen’s app issue can only be solved if the OS is offered on more devices, and especially ones that have higher-end hardware. But with Android and iOS’ duopoly, selling higher-end Tizen phones will be a tough task, and it will remain the primary reason why many app developers will look elsewhere. Tizen, therefore, once again stands to be an OS for those starting with a smartphone for the first time. The support for emulating Android apps has helped its case, with apps like MX Player making their way to Tizen, but it’s not enough to make Tizen a competent alternative.. If there’s one highly positive thing about Samsung’s Tizen phones, it’s the performance they offer for the asking price. As with previous devices, there is a slight delay between you tapping on something and the phone responding to it, but Tizen manages to run very smoothly across the user interface and inside apps. Basic games also perform well, and Samsung’s browser does a great job at loading even heavy websites.. Audio and call quality is where the Z4 falters. The loudspeaker’s volume doesn’t go very high, which is in stark contrast to the speaker on last year’s Z2. Any slightly noisy environment will have you straining to hear what’s playing on the phone, and getting the earphones (which are also rather basic) out whenever possible is the best way to get around it. The speaker is also tuned towards the higher frequencies (treble); the low and mid frequencies lose punch as a result, and overall, the audio quality over the speakers isn’t great.. Worse than the audio performance is the Z4’s call quality. I’m not sure if it was an issue with my unit, but I suffered network issues numerous times. While the phone would show full network strength, it would be impossible to hear what the other person was saying at times. This extended to both ends of the call, and it was plain irritating every time a call would come in. Thankfully, LTE performance was great, and I had no issues with browsing or using other apps over the internet with Wi-Fi turned off. But the poor call quality is a big concern, especially since quite a few folks would tend to buy a Tizen phone as a secondary device for calls.. The Z4’s 2,050 mAh battery is bigger than the Z2’s but smaller than the Z3’s, and in regular usage, it manages to offer nearly two days of battery life with two active SIM cards. Battery life was so stable that I never went in to the battery settings to see battery stats. Using the phone as a mobile hotspot for my second device was the only time that I would need to worry about the battery running out, but at other times, the Z4 keeps at it for at least a day before you need to connect it to the charger. Naturally, Tizen’s lightweight nature and the phone’s meager hardware help with battery endurance, and like the phone’s software performance, battery life is another highlight for Samsung’s newest Tizen device.. That was the tagline I used for the Samsung Z2 when I reviewed it last year, and I would do the same for the Z4 if I could. While the app scene has gotten better and all Tizen phones have offered impressive performance, they just aren’t worth it for anyone who isn’t on a very tight budget, looking for a secondary device, or switching from a feature phone for the first time. Android alternatives in the same price range may not come from big manufacturers like Samsung, but if you can live with the risk of lower hardware quality, cheap Android phones are a better choice over Samsung’s Tizen devices.. Quite a few folks have wondered when Samsung would bring Tizen to a high-end device, and I’m afraid the answer is that it could be a long, long time before the Korean giant makes that move. As a platform intended to work across a wide variety of product categories, Tizen makes sense. As a smartphone OS, however, Tizen is a little bit too late to the party. The fact that Tizen runs on extremely low-end hardware means app developers would see no point in putting resources into making native apps, unless Samsung decides to start paying developers for the same, a move that didn’t work out great even for Microsoft’s Windows Phone operating system.. But then again, maybe Samsung is happy sticking to the lowest rung of the budget market with its in-house OS. Tizen phones have been flying off the shelves ever since the first handset was launched, and they act as an affordable step into the smartphone world for consumers who are still using feature phones. They get basic tasks done quite well, and their performance would also put some costlier Android devices to shame. The same is true of the Samsung Z4, and like I said earlier, the device is only recommended for those on a tight budget, those looking for a secondary phone for calls, and for those who want to stay up-to-date with what Samsung is doing with its proprietary mobile operating system.. Reviews Samsung Z4 Tizen Z4. Unity releases its last version with support for Tizen and Samsung Smart TVs. Yubuy’s app allows Samsung TV owners in Portugal to shop online on the big screen. Samsung is bringing Tizen to even more home appliances. There’s no Skype app for Tizen yet, but there’s a workaround if you want to use the IM service. You must be logged in to post a comment..

I think the article should be written from the perspective of the audience that purchases such phones. You can still write an objective article from the price point of those who cannot afford flagship phones without being negative. I wouldn’t ask Kim Kardashian to review a Ford Fiesta because she cannot relate to those who would be in the market for such a budget car. Perspective is very important and this article seems very negative for my taste (especially for a website ….

ABHIJEET I usually find your reviews objective and pragmatic not negative be it about a high, mid or low end phone released by Samsung. Don’t get discouraged by those accusing you of being harsh on Samsung for no reasons. Being a Samsung fan doesn’t mean you have to swallow everything Samsung has done wrong lately. I don’t always agree with you but I do more often than not.. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 1 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. Thanks for the support, and yes, that’s exactly how we approach things. Positive articles get written by plenty across the web, but it’s the little irritations and issues that we come across more often given we live and breathe Samsung devices. That’s not to say we shouldn’t focus on positivity, but the negative articles aren’t just written for the sake of being negative.. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 2 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. As I said, in my view they are well balanced flagging up the things Samsung could and should have done better which is the point and it’s good for us costumers.

You have lost a lot of loyal customer's.. i think it is a good phone because of picture quality, network wise but i hate this thing of not sharing apps with others. I am so heartbroken by the Samsung Z4 shame, it doesn't have many features n it doesn't install any type of apps. this fown is a waste of time and money. Samsung I want my money back this is phone of yours. I cnt even install apps from other phones yet alone downloading them. and the Tizen store is also crapy js upgrade the damn phone or else refund us. this is not a smart phone it's a Toy I am so mad right now. Winner, 23 Dec 2017 This is not a phone at all...i mean it can't allow you to install apps from other devices ...... more Actually this is a phone, but not so "smart" phone... This is the worst phone on the market. Well the phone itself might be ok but the os (tizen) should be scrapped. It has no place in the market trying to compete with google play store. User friendlyness is out of the window. I strongly advise that no one should buy any phone with the tizen operating system. You will not get your monies worth. how can i get my money back, coz i regret buying this z4. when u press no 2 appears 3. losser, 28 Nov 2017 VERY WORST PHONE... I dont have suitable worst word to describe this samsung Z4..... more This is not a phone at all...i mean it can't allow you to install apps from other devices ...whats the use of having if you can't share things with people around you ..this was just a waste of money. boston - Fair phone, 02 Dec 2017 I understand some people's frustrations. But before i bought this Z4, i googled it first&amp... It's intended for a "smart-ish" phone. Kinda a cross between the old Brew MP phones and Android. Basic smart phone functions without the insanity of all the apps. These really should be offered to the senior crowd. Stop giving an 80 year old a year old Android phone. It's so much stuff that they just get themselves frustrated and furthered turned off from technology.. What's the app support like on this phone?. I got this phone yesterday and fair enough its a new OS and not many are used to it. Functionality is smooth and so far no hiccups. Its a great little phone as an entry level phones go. Camera is good all apps work perfectly. The app store has to play catch up but all in due course.. I hate this phone..so useless ..picture quality is great,but this phone ai..waste of money. This samsung z4 phone is nothing but waste of time and money and i dont encourage people to buy it. Pages: 1 2 3 4 5 ». Total of 94 user reviews and opinions for Samsung Z4 ..
