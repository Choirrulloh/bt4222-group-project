Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with MIUI 7. 3,260 mAh non-removable battery, fast charging. Hybrid microSD/SIM slot - memory card uses SIM 2 slot, can't have both simultaneously. The Xiaomi Mi 4s went official hours before the Mi 5, a teaser of sorts for the headliner. It even made the trip to Barcelona but enjoyed little of the spotlight for obvious reasons. This is the fourth installment in the Mi 4 lineup - hardly breaking news in a week full of high-profile announcements. Yet, we bet the new Xiaomi flagship wouldn't mind repeating the success of a predecessor that spawned quite the offspring.. A year and a half separates the Mi 4 and the incumbent Mi 5 flagship - the time in-between was filled with a couple of phablets, including the Quad-HD Xiaomi Mi Note Pro, and a couple of Mi 4 modifications. The Xiaomi Mi 4 turned out quite a popular device, and the company was keen to use the flagship momentum in the midrange Mi 4i and Mi 4c versions.. Meanwhile, the Redmi Note series too made themselves comfortable in the midrange, and now Xiaomi fills an upper midrange spot with the Mi 4s. It builds on the Mi 4c with premium looks, more storage, more RAM, and more battery capacity, and flaunts a new fingerprint scanner at the back.. Xiaomi is sticking to the dual-glass design in both the flagship Mi 5 and the Mi 4s. Compared to the Mi 5, the Mi 4s uses a different kind of metal frame sprayed with zircon sand for a pleasant soft touch and improved grip.. Before we get into details, let's take a closer look at the spec sheet, shall we?. Xiaomi hasn't done anything unusual with the Mi 4S - after all, the flagship understandably received more attention. The re-design works quite well though and the hexa-core chipset is a sensible choice considering the phone's standing in the pecking order. Its productivity should be comparable to a Snapdragon 650, power efficiency in favor of the 20nm Snapdragon 808.. As usual with Xiaomi, the sealed battery and the shared SIM / MicroSD card slot shouldn't be unexpected. We hope the Mi 4s lives up to its legacy and, well, keep the surprises mostly pleasant. Let's see how the things turn out this time - our hardware tour starts right after the break.. Special thanks to HonorBuy.com for providing us with this review unit..

Xiaomi Mi 4S Review A great smartphone that feels misplaced within Xiaomi's lineup. by Bailey Stein April 22, 2016. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. - Good camera in ideal conditions. - Disappointing camera in low light. - Ships with outdated version of Android. - MIUI is still missing features found in stock Android. - Bootloader unlocking process is unwieldy. - No OIS in the camera. Although the Xiaomi Mi 4S is a great smartphone for the price, its release feels unjustified relative to other products in Xiaomi's own lineup. With remarkably similar Xiaomi smartphones like the only slightly more expensive Mi 5 and the much less expensive Redmi Note 3, the Mi 4S sort of feels like a phone for nobody. If you are looking for a new smartphone from Xiaomi, we recommend looking elsewhere.. Xiaomi has adopted a design language similar to that of the OnePlus X for the Mi 4S. However, there are still several noteworthy design decisions. Once you hold the Xiaomi Mi 4S for the first time, you will notice that the curved glass and contouring aluminum found on the Mi 5 are absent. The Mi 4S feels more so like a traditional smartphone compared to the Mi 5, although I must say that I generally like the design for its minimalistic appeal.. This does raise a few concerns regarding the Mi 4S’ durability, as well as a reservation about the decision to not use Corning Gorilla Glass 4 on both the front and back glass panels.. If you are expecting 4G LTE with the Xiaomi Mi 4S, you may be in for a surprise as the device does not generally support the frequencies used outside of China that are required to transmit data over LTE. In the U.S., for example, you will be limited to HSPA+ on AT&T in all areas and HSPA+ on T-Mobile in some areas. While T-Mobile’s HSPA+ network is respectably fast, and AT&T’s is often fairly quick in most areas as well, this may be a deal breaker for some. Do keep in mind, however, that this phone should work flawlessly wherever it is sold officially. Here is the frequency list for the Chinese variant:. The fingerprint reader on the back of the Xiaomi Mi 4S is perhaps unsurprisingly similar to the one found on the Redmi Note 3. It’s both accurate and fast, oftentimes even comparable to the Nexus 6P’s fingerprint reader. Xiaomi also included a USB Type-C port, as well as compatibility with Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 2.0. If you look towards the right of the USB Type-C port, you’ll find a surprisingly loud speaker. Unfortunately, it sounds distorted and tinny, especially at higher volumes.. During my battery life tests, the Xiaomi Mi 4S performed very well, despite falling just short of the Mi 5 ‘s battery life. This surprised me as the Mi 4S has a larger 3080mAh internal battery and has a more power efficient processor. I did notice excessive battery life use by the Android System, which likely can and may be fixed with a future software update. However, battery life was still very good and average users should be able to get about a day and a half of use, while heavy users can still expect a full day.. All things considered, the 13 MP rear camera on the Xiaomi Mi 4S performed very well. Images taken in good lighting were sharp and detailed, in addition to having a healthy amount of dynamic range. HDR also worked well, and while the Mi 4S’ camera may be inferior to the one found on the Mi 5 , the difference in image quality is often considerably marginal.. Xiaomi is shipping the Mi 4S with MIUI 7 over Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. That was a bit disappointing to see, since the latest iteration of Android, Marshmallow, has been out for around six months now. MIUI may receive a fair bit of criticism for its iOS-like design, but it is actually very enjoyable in day-to-day use. That’s at least partly thanks to the amount of customization that Xiaomi has packed in, which will please many Android enthusiasts.. Here is where it gets complicated. Xiaomi recently started locking boot loaders , in an effort to curb reseller shenanigans and increase security. Unfortunately, many resellers have evidently been able to get around this, and have even blocked updating in their custom ROMs, forcing you to unlock the boot loader if you wish to have a secure experience. What’s worse is that the unlocking process is very complicated. Users are forced to wait up to ten days and some features, such as Xiaomi’s “find my device,” are permanently disabled.. This is only an issue if you chose to import the device, however. If you buy the Mi 4S through an official channel, you will have absolutely no trouble.. With that said, the release of the Xiaomi Mi 4S in general feels unjustified relative to other products in Xiaomi’s own lineup. In a way, the Mi 4S feels like a phone for nobody, as the Mi 5 is only $50 more and offers a considerably better experience, while the Redmi Note 3 is less than half the price yet offers a strikingly similar experience.. With the addition of yet another revision of the Mi 4 , Xiaomi has expanded their Mi line to include what may seem to be a worthy alternative to the Mi 5 , at least at first glance. The Xiaomi Mi 4S boasts several premium aspects such as a Snapdragon 808, glass design, and a plentiful 64 GB of expandable storage. Despite these attributes, Xiaomi has priced the Mi 4S competitively at just 1699 RMB, or about $263. Let’s take a much closer look with our Xiaomi Mi 4S review!. The Mi 4S feels more so like a traditional smartphone compared to the Mi 5. A patterned rear design on the gold and pink models does add a little extra flair to the overall design, however. The power and volume buttons on the right side of the Xiaomi Mi 4S felt tactile and responsive, and I would consider them to be on par with the vast majority of flagship smartphones. I was also happy with the IR blaster on the top of the device, which made it easy to control my television and other household appliances without the use of a physical remote.. I do have a few gripes with the design of the Xiaomi Mi 4S. Most remarkably is the device’s slipperiness when placed on soft or unlevel surfaces like a couch or window sill. Unfortunately, my unit’s display cracked after taking a three foot fall from the latter to a hardwood floor.. My unit's display cracked after taking a three foot fall from a window sill to a hardwood floor. There is a multi-colored notification LED for notifications like missed calls and text messages, which, while standard for Xiaomi devices, seems to be a seriously underrated feature. Xiaomi also retained their standardized capacitive key design with the Mi 4S, making the transition from other Xiaomi smartphones less of a learning experience.. Xiaomi has chartered into the territory of comfortable one-handed use, thanks to the smaller 5″ 1080P full HD display. The display on the Xiaomi Mi 4S is pretty good overall. While I did prefer the Mi 5 ‘s deeper blacks and more relaxed color reproduction, the display on the Mi 4S offers up plenty of saturation and vibrance, as well as very good contrast and excellent viewing angles. It was also easily viewable outdoors during my testing, which is undoubtedly a very important attribute for many of us.. The Xiaomi Mi 4S is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 , a processor which is otherwise rarely accessible for under $300. The 808 was able to power through my usage demands with relative ease, and I did not take note of any lag during my couple of weeks with the phone. There is 3 GB of RAM as well, which is oftentimes more than enough when multitasking.. There’s also an Adreno 418 GPU which helps ensure smooth gaming performance. Overall, the Xiaomi Mi 4S was able to play everything I threw at it with relative ease. However, it is important to understand that this GPU may soon begin to show its age, and newly released games may not perform as well as current titles.. 4G LTE support may be a deal breaker for some. On a positive note, call quality was excellent during our testing. Since this is an unlocked dual-SIM device, you may use up to two individual SIM cards with the Mi 4S simultaneously. The nano-SIM slot can also double as a microSD card expansion slot, allowing you to add more storage, assuming that the 64 GB of internal storage isn’t enough.. The fingerprint reader is both accurate and fast. Average users should be able to get about a day and a half of use, while heavy users can still expect a full day. The 13 MP rear camera performed very well. Although the dual-LED flash on the back helps even out skin tones, OIS is unfortunately missing. That may be one of the primary causes for relatively poor low-light performance, which can be seen in the various camera samples above. The 5 MP f/2.0 front-facing camera did perform well enough for my needs, and produced nice looking selfies.. Thankfully, the camera software shipping with the Mi 4S is the same software found on the Mi 5. It’s easy to use in auto mode, but can also be very powerful in manual mode, offering control over white balance, focus, exposure time, and ISO in manual mode.. MIUI is very enjoyable in day-to-day use. Built-in features such as a comprehensive theme store, call recording, app cleaner, advanced data usage management, call & text blacklist, advanced battery life profiles, virus scanner, app permissions, bug reporting, and a seemingly countless number of settings options can be found on the Mi 4S. What’s even better is Xiaomi’s commitment to keeping their Mi devices updated by releasing weekly stable updates, which sometimes add new features and almost always include bug fixes and optimizations.. If you chose to import the Mi 4S from a reseller in China, you need to be aware of a few potential complications. Since the stock China software shipping on Chinese variants does not include Google apps, many resellers have decided to manually add them for you. This sounds great, but in practice, they often add bloatware and sometimes even malware as well. Therefore, it would be very wise for you to flash the global ROM, which includes Google apps, in order to have the best experience possible. Without flashing a stock ROM, you will not be able to receive weekly updates and your personal information may be at risk due to possible malware.. If importing, you must unlock the boot loader if you wish to have a secure experience, a process which can take up to ten days. Overall, MIUI offers a stable experience that has been carefully curated and tweaked over the past few versions and while it is missing a few features found in stock Android, it will be comfortable for any MIUI enthusiast to use.. The Xiaomi Mi 4S is now available in white, black, gold, or pink within China for 1699 RMB (≈$263). Each Mi 4S includes 64 GB of onboard storage, but, as mentioned earlier, you can expand that via a microSD card.. There is no doubt that the Xiaomi Mi 4S is a great smartphone, especially for the price. Despite its flaws of a lack of global availability, disappointing low-light camera performance, and an outdated version of Android, there are several reasons why the Mi 4S may be appealing. Its very nice display, impressive performance for the price, excellent battery life, and great daylight camera performance may be enough to win over many who would have instead purchased the Mi 5 .. Xiaomi Mi 4i review: not a flagship,.... With nearly a dozen new smartphones in 2015, Xiaomi may even be cannibalizing its own market by releasing so many different models at similar price points, when each model is only marginally different. If you are looking for a new smartphone from Xiaomi, we recommend considering either the slightly more expensive Mi 5 or the much less expensive Redmi Note 3 instead of the Mi 4S.. What do you think of the Xiaomi Mi 4S and do you plan to buy one or is one of Xiaomi’s other handsets more your flavour? Let us know your views in the comments below!.

Officially announced 24 Feb 2016 24 Feb 2016. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $240 Buy.

Customs is a governmental agency responsible for regulating the shipments entering a specific country or region. All shipments being sent to or from region must clear Customs first. It is always the buyer's responsibility to clear customs and pay the relevant Customs duties.. Regarding the issue of tariff and customs taxes, this is dependent on the specific local customs policies and regulations. Some countries have very strict and tight regulations regarding import goods while other countries are much more relaxed.. For all our customers, we never add taxes, VAT, duty, or any other hidden charges.. Please rest assured that We will do our very best to help you avoid or minimize tariff payments.. We'll try our best to help our clients avoiding custom taxes, but because of the complexity of different countries’ Custom tax policy, we are not sure if your package can pass custom without tax.. I live in Brazil, but I would like to send the phone to a friend in China and he will bring to me in Brazil. Will Gearbest send a unlocked phone (International ROM)?. By Alessandro May-08/2016 01:05:06. Yes, we can send you a unlocked phone (International ROM).. Welcome to buy items on our website.. Sending to Portugal, do I have to pay any customs fee? Or is it safe to order without any extra "surprise" costs...?. By Heryck Almeida Apr-19/2016 01:04:43. Hello Heryck， Taxes do not come from us if any. Taxes are beyond Gearbest's control and only depend on the delivery country's regulations and policies. Generally, import taxes can be reduced and in some cases avoided ( if applicable) with postal deliveries.

Xiaomi has been slowly building up from offering inexpensive budget smartphones to more mid-range and high-end models that tend to sell at much higher margins. This jump in quality is apparent when taking a closer look at the Redmi 2 versus its much improved Redmi 3 successor.. The 5-inch Mi 4s is the updated version of the Mi 4 in the same manner as the iPhone 6s is to the iPhone 6. For Xiaomi, however, the Mi 4s is more than just an internal upgrade as the chassis is now thinner and with more features not previously available in the series.. Main competitors to the Mi 4s include the OnePlus X , Asus Zenfone 2 , and Google Nexus 5X considering the $300 to $350 price range of the smartphone.. Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 MSM8992 Qualcomm Adreno 418. Test device courtesy of ibuygou.com. (download rating image as PNG or SVG ).

Our Gold test unit gives off a luxurious luster with at least three different types of surfaces making up the chassis. The glass-covered front is completely flat with almost no rise around the edges and corners. The rounded aluminum sides of the phone are a slippery matte finish with striped chrome-cut edges and corners for glossy accents. Meanwhile, the back of the phone utilizes another smooth layer of glass similar to the recent Galaxy S6 series, but with a cross-diamond pattern underneath to avoid what would have otherwise been a plain plastic look. Even the camera and LED Flash modules are recessed onto the same plane as the glass for a completely flat surface. It's clear that Xiaomi had invested much more in the aesthetics of the design compared to its older generation of plastic smartphones.. Workmanship is nearly perfect around the edges and corners where the different materials meet. Unfortunately on our test unit, we are able to notice a small and depressible gap between the back cover and edge of the smartphone. While this may be more common on smartphones with removable back covers, designs with non-removable battery packs like the Mi 4s are expected to have a much more solid seal around its edges. The potential for gaps is a drawback from not using a unibody design.. Overall rigidity is above average with no creaking or cracks when attempting to twist from the sides or when applying pressure down its center. A bit of bending and warping is possible with a moderate amount of force, but nothing extensive enough to be a cause for concern.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. When comparing its size to other 5-inch smartphones, the Mi 4s is thinner and smaller than the Honor 5X and even thinner than the Galaxy S7 by one-tenth of a millimeter. The OnePlus X comes in even thinner than the Mi 4s and with a faster Snapdragon 810 SoC at the cost of much higher surface temperatures. Xiaomi still has the edge in weight as its model is one of the lightest 5-inch smartphones available at 133 grams.. Micro-USB is slowly but surely being phased out in favor of USB Type-C. In this case, the Type-C port is limited to standard USB 2.0 speeds like on the OnePlus 2 , so the only benefit here is the hassle-free reversible end. Otherwise, the usual 3.5 mm earphone port is located next to the IR source on top.. There is no integrated NFC available, so contact-less payment is beyond the reach of the Mi 4s.. Top: IR blaster, 3.5 mm audio. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

The MIUI 7.0 software is based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and is low on extraneous features and background applications. Thus, the system feels swift with few interruptions and popup notifications and is overall closer to stock Android than other custom UIs.. In return, there are numerous pre-installed applications, many of which are geared towards users in Asia with news, apps, and music from the region. The Google Play Store must be installed by the user through means that aren't exactly intuitive.. The integrated dual-band (2.4/5 GHz) WLAN supports WiFi Direct and Hotspot for tethering purposes. We experienced no random drops or connectivity issues during our time with the test unit. Reception is better than the LG G3 under the same distances and conditions according to WiFi Analyzer.. GPS accuracy is reliable enough for road navigation. The smartphone is less accurate around turns and corners compared to the Garmin standard, so twists and turns on winding paths will accentuate the weaknesses of the Xiaomi phone when used for GPS tracking..

Officially supported bands include GSM 850/900/1800/1900, HSDPA 850/1900/2100, and 4G LTE Cat 4 150/50 Mbps download/upload. See Xiaomi's specifications on the Mi 4s for a complete list of compatible networks. Access to the Micro-SIM and Nano-SIM tray on the edge of the device will require a sharp pin.. Call quality under the AT&T network is clear, but with a low maximum volume. Thus, voices become much more coherent when switching to speakerphone instead of using the earpiece. As for the LG G3 listener on the other end, the caller was sensitive to any background noises such as traffic or crowds. Our voice was otherwise loud and clear through the Xiaomi. We experienced no consistent static or dropped calls during our time with the test unit.. Camera quality from the rear 13 MP sensor is very good with minimal grains and muddiness that tend to be much more common on cheaper smartphones. Images captured with the Mi 4s approach the sharpness of the LG G3 camera, albeit with some caveats that make the Xiaomi fall just short. In particular, brown colors have a tendency to be exhibit a Green tint, so colors are not as natural as they could have been.. Low-light and indoor performances, however, are merely average from the standard f/2.0 aperture lens with image noise becoming much more prevalent. The slow auto-focus is nothing special either as the phone lacks the faster laser auto-focus capabilities of some higher-end models.. Video recording is available up to 1080p30. Unfortunately, quality here is on the blurry side and with muted colors. The slow auto-focus is more of an issue here as well. Slow-motion recording is available only at the 720p setting or lower.. Touch-typing on the Mi 4s is reliable and equally responsive around the edges and corners as it is towards the center. The output is displayed as fast as the user can type, so the software is able to keep up with fast typists without any issues. The surface is sensitive enough for even the lightest of taps to register consistently. The vibration feedback could have been stronger, but the experience is still excellent overall.. Meanwhile, the rear fingerprint reader works quickly (<1 second) without issues and can save scans of multiple fingers. Unlike the fingerprint readers on some budget devices like the Bluboo Xtouch , your finger does not need to be perfectly oriented the same way each time to unlock the phone. The reader will work just as swiftly if the finger happens to be upside down or sideways.. The 5-inch 1080p screen offers a very sharp picture with colors that seem to pop due to the thin layer of glass on top. The backlight is powerful at almost 500 nits to put the Xiaomi ahead of mainstream models like the One A9 and OnePlus X, yet behind the flagship Galaxy S6 and Xperia Z5 Premium. Measured contrast is excellent at nearly 900:1.. Backlight bleeding isn't an issue around the edges or corners. Instead, the backlight is fairly uneven as the bottom half of the screen is brighter than the top half. The difference is fortunately not significant enough to notice during everyday use, though this is certainly an area to improve upon for future revisions..

Further display measurements with an X-Rite spectrophotometer reveal good grayscale and color accuracy with no notable outliers. Nonetheless, models like the Nexus 5X and even the One A9 offer more accurate colors and a gamma closer to the 2.2 sRGB ideal. For everyday use, however, the minute differences are not significant..

In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.9 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. Outdoor visibility is good under shade and poor under direct sunlight. The backlight is not powerful enough to overcome both glare and sunlight, so onscreen content will appear washed out. Luckily, the wide viewing angles make avoiding glare much easier without sacrificing color quality or contrast. Apparent brightness will be a bit dimmer if viewing from too wide of an angle, which is common amongst IPS panels.. The Snapdragon 808 is a relatively new high-end processor from Qualcomm that made its debut on last year's flagship LG G4 and is only now trickling down to mainstream devices like the Mi 4s. According to CPU-Z, the hexa-core SoC can run as slow as 384 MHz for power-saving purposes and up to 1.82 GHz when applications demand it. Coupled with the system's 3 GB RAM, the Mi 4s is carrying a hefty amount of power for its class.. Multi-core CPU benchmarks rank the Xiaomi phone alongside systems like the Nexus 6 , Nexus 9 , and LG G4 while being consistently behind the Galaxy S6 and the OnePlus 2 with the Exynos 7420 and Snapdragon 810 SoCs, respectively. Thus, raw performance sits comfortably between mainstream and pricier flagship smartphones.. Linpack Android / IOS Multi Thread Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Mali-T760 MP8, 7420 Octa, 32 GB UFS 2.0 Flash.

Its sequential write rates in particular are extremely fast and even edges out the Galaxy S6 Edge just slightly. Otherwise, the Samsung flagship outclasses the Xiaomi in sequential read speeds and random read and write speeds.. MicroSD is supported for even more storage. Note that the card slot uses the same slot as the Nano-SIM card, so both cannot be utilized simultaneously..

The integrated Adreno 418 is significantly ahead of the older Adreno 405 according to 3DMark benchmarks, but is still much slower than the high-end Mali-T760 or Adreno 430 as found in the Galaxy S6 and Xperia Z5 Premium, respectively. All titles from the Play Store should still be more than playable and we experienced no major stuttering when running Asphalt 8 or NOVA 3 .. Minor throttling will occur according to the GFXBench Battery Life test. Average frame times see a sharp increase roughly halfway into the half-hour long stress test. While the throttling isn't significant enough to affect everyday use, users playing games will notice the increase in surface temperatures much more dramatically than any potential performance dips during extended use.. 3DMark 1920x1080 Ice Storm Extreme Physics Xiaomi Mi 4s Adreno 418, 808 MSM8992, 64 GB eMMC Flash.

Surface temperatures when idling are flat across the board with no significant hot spots. Medium workloads and browsing will warm the smartphone quite quickly and gaming can bring it to near uncomfortable levels. Playing games like Asphalt 8 , for example, is difficult on the palms since the surfaces of the smartphone are much warmer on the sides than they are towards the center. The dedicated front Android keys also become quite warm.. Competing models like the OnePlus X and HTC One A9 also reach high surface temperatures averaging nearly 40 C under extreme conditions while the Nexus 5X and Zenfone 2 run comparatively cooler.. 43.2 °C 37.2 °C 42.4 °C. 42.4 °C 37.2 °C 43.6 °C. 38.8 °C 36.4 °C 38.8 °C.

(Yellow: Background, Pink: Pink noise, Gray: White noise). The single speaker lies to the right of the USB port behind the set of five holes. The symmetric design suggests stereo speakers, but the opposite set of grilles houses the microphone instead. It can be easy to cover up the speaker grilles when in Landscape mode due to their positioning on the bottom edge.. Sound quality is good for a smartphone in that sounds feel balanced with no degradation even on higher volume settings. Thus, it avoids the "tin can" quality common on cheaper models. Low frequencies are barely audible according to our measurements, which shouldn't be a surprise considering the size.. The Mi 4s is certainly a power-hungry smartphone even when sitting idle on a full charge. Its power demands are higher than most competing 5-inch smartphones at every tested condition from idling at minimum brightness to benchmark stress testing at maximum brightness..

Fortunately, the Xiaomi carries a dense battery pack to compensate for the higher power draw. This also means that runtimes aren't necessarily any longer than competing models. We were able to clock in just over six hours of constant WLAN use at a 150 nit brightness setting, which is a low average for its size class. The Nexus 5X and OnePlus X can last for noticeably longer under similar testing conditions.. Charging via an outlet will take approximately two hours from near zero to full. Charging via a standard USB port will take much longer..

It's hard to find major faults with the Mi 4s. Performance is at the upper echelon of a mainstream smartphone and its design gives an impression that is costlier than its retail price would otherwise suggest. Display quality is excellent and with a strong backlight while the fingerprint reader, dual SIM capabilities, MicroSD reader, and very light weight only add to the list of advantages. The Mi 4s feels very balanced with no one characteristic falling short of expectations.. Instead, the Mi 4s features a fair number of smaller downsides that separate it from phones almost twice its retail price. Its display backlight is a bit uneven and our test model exhibited a small but noticeable gap between the edges of the chassis. Auxiliary features like NFC and wireless charging are missing and its USB Type-C port is limited to USB 2.0 specifications. Battery life and surface temperatures aren't horrible, but have a lot of room for improvement.. The $300 to $350 retail price, however, pits the Mi 4s directly against the Nexus 5X. The slightly larger and brighter screen of the Nexus, longer battery life, lower temperatures, NFC, and pure Android experience are all valid reasons to choose the Google phone over the Xiaomi. If the design, dual SIM, and MicroSD capabilities of the Xiaomi phone are more appealing, then the Mi 4s has the slight edge.. Attractively designed smartphone with better-than-average stats from bottom to top. A few aspects are less than stellar where other similarly priced mainstream smartphones are able to leapfrog over the Xiaomi.. Xiaomi Mi 4s - 2016-04-21 04/21/2016 v5.1 Allen Ngo.

Xiaomi, once again taking a page from the Apple playbook, releases the Xiaomi Mi4s right alongside its new flagship, the Mi5. The Mi4s is an updated, all-metal version of the Chinese company’s popular Mi4.. The Mi4s looks pretty good, with a slick metal design that looks very similar to the iPhone 6. Unlike the iPhone, the Mi4s sports a fingerprint scanner at the rear, LG-style. Xiaomi has had a long history of trying to look a lot like Apple – the MiPad was a dead ringer for the iPad Mini, and the original Mi4 looked a lot like the iPhone 5. It’s not surprising that the next generation device also looks just a bit like the iPhone 6, but that’s neither here nor there. The phone looks great, but more importantly, it also performs great.. The Mi4s comes with a 5-inch touchscreen display with 1080p resolution at 441 pixels-per-inch. Inside is a hexa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor with 3GB of RAM. The phone has an internal storage of 64GB, with a microSD slot for expansion. A rear camera with 13-megapixels pairs with a 5-megapixel front camera for selfies. The phone has a 3,260mAh battery and will ship with Android Marshmallow 6.0.. One of the great things about Xiaomi is its affordability. The Mi4s goes for only $260 for the 64GB version. In addition, the phone will come in four colors: white, black, gold, and special lavender color that Xiaomi says is made especially for girls.. Xiaomi is sure to be making in-roads once again with its Mi4s. It’s interesting to see Xiaomi follow Apple’s strategy of offering a lower-cost reissue of a previous model, enhanced and occupying an entry-level position in the mobile lineup. Unlike the iPhone 5C, though, which is more than $500 without a contract, the Mi4s clocks in at $260, making it a true entry-level phone cost-wise.. The Mi4s will be available on March 1 in China, but again the problem is likely that it will not reach North American shores anytime soon.. Xiaomi Mi 4s is truly a magnificent smartphone. 5 inch HD display with a resolution of 1080 pixel by 1920 pixel at 441 PPI pixels per inch has been featured. hexa core 1.8 GHz Cortex A7 processor with Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 and Adreno 430 GPU is used which gives this smartphone a fast operation. RAM of 3GB has been provided for improving personal experience. Xiaomi Mi 4s in the Philippines. Price of this new Mi 4s model. Xiaomi’s new Mi 4s smartphone is work of a genius.

Information about the colors, in which the device is available in the market.. Materials used in the fabrication of the device's body.. Information about the type and size (form factor) of the SIM card used in the device.. Information about the number of SIM cards, supported by the device.. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) was developed to replace the analog cellular network (1G), therefore it is referred to as a 2G mobile network. It has been improved with the addition of General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) and later via the Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) technology.. CDMA (Code-Division Multiple Access) is a channel access method for communications within mobile networks. Compared to other 2G and 2.5G standards like GSM and TDMA, it provides increased data transfer speeds and allows more subscribers to connect simultaneously to the network.. CDMA2000 is a family of 3G standards for mobile networks based on CDMA and providing high-quality voice and broadband data services over wireless networks. Its advantages include stronger signal, fewer drop-offs and breakups, analog capabilities, very high spectral capacity, etc.. TD-SCDMA (Time Division Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access) is a 3G standard for mobile networks. It is developed as an alternative to the W-CDMA standard in China by the Chinese Academy of Telecomunications Technology, Datang Telecom and Siemens AG, and combines TDMA and CDMA.. UMTS stands for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System. Based on the GSM standard, it is deemed as a 3G mobile network standard. It has been developed by the 3GPP and its major advantage is the provision of greater bandwidth and spectral efficiency, due to the W-CDMA technology.. LTE is deemed to be the fourth generation (4G) of mobile communications technology. It has been developed by the 3GPP based on the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies in order to increase the speed and capacity of wireless data networks. A further development of the technology is called LTE Advanced.. There are several network technologies that enhance the performance of mobile networks mainly by increased data bandwidth. Information about the communication technologies supported by the device and their respective uplink and downlink bandwidth.. Information about the operating system used by the device as well as its version.. The SoC integrates different hardware components such as the CPU, GPU, memory, peripherals, interfaces, etc., as well as software for their functioning.. Information about the process technology used in manufacturing the chip. The value in nanometers represents half the distance between elements that make up the CPU.. CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. Some processors have a level 0 cache memory, which is accessed quicker than the L1, L2, L3, and so one cache memories. Besides achieving better performance, it also consumes less power.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors. They increase the performance of the device allowing the execution of multiple instructions in parallel.. The frequency of the processor describes its clock rate in cycles per second. It is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. GPU is a graphical processing unit, which handles computation for 2D/3D graphics applications. In mobile devices GPU is usually utilized by games, UI, video playback, etc. GPU can also perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the CPU.. The frequency is the clock rate of the graphic processor (GPU), which is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. RAM (Random-Access Memory) is used by the operating system and all installed applications. Data in the RAM is lost after the device is turned off or restarted.. Information about the type of RAM used by the device.. Information about the number of RAM channels integrated in the SoC. More channels mean higher data transfer rates.. RAM frequency relates directly to the rate of reading/writing from/in the RAM memory.. Information about the capacity of the built-in storage of the device. Sometimes one and the same model may is offered in variants with different internal storage capacity.. The various types of memory cards are characterized by different sizes and capacity. Information about the supported types of memory cards.. One of the main characteristics of the display is its type/technology, on which depends its performance.. In mobile devices display size is represented by the length of its diagonal measured in inches.. The ratio between the long and the short side of the display. The display resolution shows the number of pixels on the horizontal and vertical side of the screen. The higher the resolution is, the greater the detail of the displayed content.. Information about the number of pixels per centimeter (ppcm) or per inch (ppi) of the display. The higher the pixel density, the more detailed and clearer is the information displayed on the screen..

Limited battery capacity (as compared to the other terminals). At MWC 16, Xiaomi amazed us with the early presentation of Xiaomi Mi5. come alone, as been accompanied by the last member of the Mi4 range known as Xiaomi Mi 4S. It seems that Xiaomi Mi5 is at the lead with the advanced features it offers. But still we can not deny the presence of Xiaomi Mi 4S, which is an interesting terminal for the 5-inch segment. It is the phone with the latest upgrades in the Xiaomi Mi4 series – premium built and more performance. Let’s see what Xiaomi has to offer in his latest terminal.. We can not doubt the fact that Xiaomi Mi 4S is the most comprehensive mid-range phone to date which doesn’t lack anything nor rebukes any defect. We are going to isolate the aspects of this terminal in the following categories:. Talking about the design, we previously said that this phone strike a premium look and we mean it. Unlike the previous Xiaomi smartphones which were composed of plastic reflected a sleazy appearance, but in Xiaomi Mi 4S we see a perfect metal body that gives the phone. Looking at this, the company seems to focus on providing premium phones in the future, such as Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. In simple words, Mi 4S shines gloriously with metal chassis and glass.. There are drastic improvements in the design of the smartphone, not only in terms of the material but the design is cleaner,. minimalist, with a camera on the top left and, as with Mi5, does not protrude from the chassis.. It measures 139.26 x 70.76 x 7.80 mm. The thing to be appreciated is the addition of the fingerprint reader on the back but at the center, but to be honest with you, we wanted it to be on the start button just like Meizu Pro 5. Unlike Mi5, the rear is not curved (2.5D) but flat.. On the front, it’s like the previous the terminals. Camera and speaker on the top while buttons on the bottom. A frameless body could be better, further enhancing its grace of Xiaomi Mi 4S.. The power buttons and volume are on the right side while the left we have the SIM slot and Micro-SD cards.. The previous terminals were equipped with Snapdragon 801 (Octa-Core) but this one is equipped with a Hexa-Core processor Snapdragon 808. (2 * Cortex-A57 + 4 * Cortex-A53 ARM) and accompanied with 3GB of RAM. of cores are more in the previous terminal, but the performance of Hexa-Core processor is far ahead from that of Octa-Core. We wished that Xiaomi had included the new Snapdragon 850 processor in it, but we can not demand everything to be best for a competitive price. On Antutu, the device gives a benchmark of nearly 64,000 points which are good for a mid-tier phone.. The screen of Xiaomi is of 5-inch. stupendous Full-HD display (1920 x 1080p) is observed which is same as the previous Mi 4 models but with more contrast, high brightness, and more vivid colors. The pixel density is also the same, 441 ppi ( the maximum achievement for a phone in this resolution). Well, we can not aspect it to be a Quad-HD resolution. For a too low price tag, Full-HD is excellent on the large 5-inch display.. In this section, we will talk about the total space of the terminal, it’s writing and reading speed and whether it supports a Micro-SD card or not. Firstly, like previously mentioned the terminal supports a Micro-SD card (up to. Secondly, the internal space of Xiaomi Mi 4S classifies it in two versions: 16GB and 64GB. We did a writing and reading benchmark and the results are shown in the picture below:. Here we will discuss the two cameras of the terminal – the rear and the front one. Heading to the rear camera first, it’s a 13 Megapixels, Sony Exmor camera with. f/2.0, phase detection autofocus and dual-LED (dual tone) flash.. It’s the same as the previous descendants, the only difference is that in 4S phase detection has been introduced. The other features which the camera allows is:. For video recording, it shoots a Full-HD video at 30 fps while 720p at 120 fps. It also supports 4K video recording in HDR mode but at 15 fps , too slow. Meanwhile, the front camera is 5 MP with autofocus, less than the previous terminals (8 MP), which is not that much captivating.. Like all the other phones in the world, it supports. Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual band, GPS including. A-GPS, GLONASS, BDS and WiFi Direct. But the best thing is that it supports the latest version of Bluetooth (v4.1, A2DP). and has it’s own IR port. Moving to the wired connectivity, it has USB Type C with. Dual SIM (Micro-SIM/Nano-SIM, dual stand-by) with 4G-LTE ..
