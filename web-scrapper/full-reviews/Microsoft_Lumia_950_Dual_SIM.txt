This mobile phone features a 20-megapixel resolution camera for taking impressive pictures. Stay connected with the Microsoft Lumia 950.. by robert-chambers Mar 18, 2017. I bought this for the dual SIM. This feature is not as straightforward as inserting the second SIM and continuing on. One SIM is designated as a 2G only SIM. When AT&T shuttered their 2G network it forced the AT&T SIM into either being off network or being the 3G/4G/LTE SIM, making my T-Mobile SIM 2G only. Be sure when removing the back to totally loosen the side without the buttons before attempting to remove the back. Too much flexing of the back in removal will break the thin plastic over the lock button. Replacing the back a $20+ expense if you get an original back. Knock offs have funky buttons and sometimes lack NFC or Qi charging.. Stick with the commercial releases of Windows 10. The Windows Insider releases are sometimes frustrating to use.. It is fast, works well, has an awesome screen and very good camera. I use it with the Continuum dock from time to time and that works well. Mostly, like this review, I do the work directly from the screen. I bought it when it was released and it has been my daily use phone since then. by pashkatlt552010 Mar 28, 2017.

Microsoft Lumia 950 is a smartphone developed by Microsoft , officially revealed on October 6, 2015 [1] alongside the larger Lumia 950 XL. The phone was first released on AT&T in the US on November 17, 2015, [2] [3] and subsequently made available on the Microsoft Store [4] as well as in other countries. The Lumia 950 is the successor to the 2014 Nokia Lumia 930 and is among the first phones to natively run Windows 10 Mobile. The phone is primarily aimed at users desiring a flagship device, in contrast to Microsoft's previous strategy of targeting developing markets with low-end hardware.. Microsoft's numbering convention designates the Lumia 950 as a 5th-generation device in the high-end 900 series.. The Lumia 950 has a polycarbonate frame with a removable back shell, allowing access to the battery as well as SIM and microSD card slots. The phone is available in two colors, black and white, although third-party replacement shells are available in different colors and materials. The Lumia 950 uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 MSM8992 SoC which combines two 1.82. GHz Cortex-A57 and four 1.44. GHz Cortex-A53 cores in a big.LITTLE architecture, allowing more computationally intensive workloads to run on the faster "big" cores while threads with less priority run on the slower "LITTLE" cores. The SoC also includes an Adreno 418 GPU and is paired with 3. GB of LPDDR3 RAM. GB of internal storage which can be expanded with microSD cards up to 200. The Lumia 950 has a 5.2. mm) AMOLED display with a resolution of 2560x1440 ( WQHD ) and a 16:9 aspect ratio. The display is protected by Gorilla Glass 3 and features ClearBlack technology for improved sunlight visibility, as well as double tap to wake, [8] but unlike earlier Lumia flagships it does not support some features like Super Sensitive touch. The Lumia 950 has a 20. MP PureView -branded rear-facing camera, containing a 1/2.4. in BSI sensor with 1.12. μm pixels and phase-detection autofocus , a 6-element Carl Zeiss lens with a f/1.9 aperture and 5th-gen optical image stabilization , and a triple- LED RGB flash that can adjust to match the color of ambient light. [10] [11] Maximum image resolution is 4992x3744 pixels (18.7. MP) in 4:3 aspect ratio and 5344x3008 pixels (16.1. The camera can also capture oversampled 8. MP images, optionally with a full-resolution DNG file that enables more post-processing possibilities. [12] The camera supports video capture at up to 4K (3840x2160) resolution, as well as slow-motion video at 120. fps, albeit at a reduced resolution of 720p.. The front-facing camera has a 5. MP sensor and a wide-angle f/2.4 lens, supporting video capture at up to 1080p resolution. The camera also supports Windows Hello through iris recognition with the help of an infrared LED. The Lumia 950 supports 4G LTE technology with maximum transfer speeds of 300. Other wireless connectivity options include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a / b / g / n / ac , Wi-Fi hotspot , NFC , Bluetooth 4.1, and wireless screen projection via Miracast. Physical connectors include a 3.5. mm audio jack , as well as a USB-C connector for charging and data transfer. The latter supports USB OTG , enabling the use of peripherals like mice, flash drives or external microphones, [14] and USB-C fast charging. The Lumia 950 supports wireless inductive charging using the Qi standard. The AT&T version also supports the PMA standard. With either the addition of a Microsoft Display Dock or by connecting to a Miracast receiver, the Lumia 950 is compatible with Windows Continuum, a technology that allows users to connect their devices to an external monitor for a desktop-like experience. The Lumia 950 originally launched with Windows 10 Mobile Version 1511. Microsoft released Windows 10 Mobile Version 1607 ( Anniversary Update ) in August 2016, [18] [19] and Version 1703 ( Creators Update ) in April 2017. The phone has issues with AT&T 's LTE network when users do not first insert a SIM card before going through the phone's setup procedure, [22] [23] Cortana can cause echoes during voice calls, [24] and the phone has been reported to have Wi-Fi issues. Australian carrier Telstra has claimed the Lumia 950 has connectivity issues on their network. Both the Lumia 950 and 950 XL were reported to experience reboots and crashes after their release. [27] Most issues were subsequently fixed with Anniversary update in 2016. The Lumia 950 was generally well-received, with most reviewers commending the high-end specifications and camera performance, but finding the design to be less "premium" than competing flagships, and the app ecosystem to be less comprehensive than Android or iOS.. Daniel Rubino of Windows Central described the phone as packing "all the bells and whistles that Windows Phone fans have been clamoring for all in one device". The review particularly praised the camera, including image quality as well as features like Rich Capture and Living Images; overall verdict for the camera was "quite phenomenal". The phone's design was called "practical, but not beautiful", and features like Windows Hello and Continuum were reported to be working well, albeit with some issues. The Windows 10 Mobile operating system and its app selection were pointed out as the biggest weaknesses. GSMArena rated the Lumia 950 very highly, saying that the phone "lives up to the hype and delivers on all advertised promises". The review highlighted the specifications, display and camera as being "top-notch" and found both Windows Hello and Continuum to be working "as advertised". While some faults were found with the design, battery life and price, the review concluded with: "Microsoft has done an amazing job with the Lumia 950... It's an eagerly anticipated phone and ... it deserves every bit of praise it gets." [29]. PhoneArena gave the Lumia 950 a score of 7/10, describing it as "a phone ideal for the Windows fan", praising the display as well as features like Windows Hello, Continuum and Office integration. The main downsides were seen to be the design and app selection, while battery performance was determined to be average. Baig of USA Today commended the camera and replaceable battery, while describing the hardware specifications as "robust". However, new features like Windows Hello and Continuum were considered not to be "fully baked", and the design was described as less premium than competing flagships. The reviewer concluded by saying: "When it comes to phones however, [Microsoft] still has plenty of work to do." [31]. Matthew Miller of ZDNet described the design as "an uninspiring, simple rectangular form factor", but acknowledged the practical advantages of plastic over materials like glass or aluminum. The Windows app ecosystem was seen as lacking in both quantity and quality compared to Android and iOS, and the reviewer expressed concern over the performance of the OS itself, although commending a number of features like "the Action Center, the awesome keyboard and predictive text engine, and reader mode in the browser". Todd Haselton of TechnoBuffalo commended the inclusion of a dedicated camera key and overall imaging capabilities, but criticized the design and said the user interface of Windows 10 Mobile "feels unfinished". The reviewer gave the phone a "Don't Buy" rating, recommending readers to wait for an improved successor. ^ Callaham, John (October 6, 2015).

I can confidently say it truly stands out from the crowd as it was marketed when it was launched back in 2015. continuum experience was a new ground for the smartphone market altogether and it blows you away with its capabilities and its execution. albeit not all apps supported continuum back then, but significant apps have been made on the UWP. the security feature as the iris scanner was also new on the table and it was awesome is all I can say, but I did miss the fingerprint reader as in the outdoor most of the times the iris scanner did fail to recognize. windows mobile is itself a subtle experience on the phone but it gets the job done. the syncing capabilities it carries is unmatched. every one know how the display is with 565 ppi and nonetheless I did find it immersive unlike the general propaganda of the washed out screen (probably people don''t know how to set it up to one''s need). battery drain was an issue till few months back and when the phone received the anniversary update It significantly improved thereafter. keeping it short the app gap on the windows store is a well known problem and keeping most the buyers at bay. but only a handful people know they do have the most used apps and are well made for the windows OS. the camera was the star attraction shooting at a 20MP with a bunch of customization for a shot really pushes the imaging standards. you can get any image you actually set in your mind. one issue was the focusing could be frustratingly slow at times and the image turned out to be well.... you know ! talking about the video recorder on the device , 4k, slow motion 120fps all is there. I know there are rumors that the lumia line up is being killed and the remarks I give wont help Microsoft sell 950s anymore but without a review this wouldn''t have been justice to the Lumia heritage and the device..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Brilliant phone and dual-sim. For me, dual sim is vital and I hate Android so three years ago I bought a Lumia 635 via the German version of the Microsoft Store (why on earth they couldn't sell dual sim directly in the UK is beyond me). Happy with it in general, but after three years decided it was time for an upgrade - in particular for better camera functionality. Shocked to find that Microsoft seem to be withdrawing these phones and couldn't even buy a single sim version direct never mind the dual sim. So ended up here on Amazon with a third-party German supplier. Transaction went swimmingly and the phone arrived within 4 working days. And I'm very pleased with it indeed. Slightly larger in size than the 635, so I had been a bit concerned that it could be too big for my hand, but it works fine for me and the extra area/better quality screen gives much more visibility. All the main items I use are much better on this phone than the 635 - messages, email, calendar, browsing - and the two cameras knock socks off the old single one. The only tiny thing I'm missing is the ability to mute the phone ringing by simply turning the phone face down - I found that very useful, not sure why Microsoft thought it wouldn't be needed in the bigger phone. All in all, a very happy punter - for now, not sure how I will feel in a few years time when I need a new one if these have completely disappeared from the market.

Now have an improved battery (replaceable), and dual sim (useful as I live in area of poor reception) with 100+ MB storage card. Software unreliable (poor connection to Microsoft band 2) 'till I updated to latest firmware. Now much improved with excellent maps, calendar etc but battery life remains an issue.

Firstly I am a life long Nokia and now windows phone user. I have tried other platforms but did not like them.

I bought this after buying the Lumia 950XL and getting a defective phone - and then three defective replacements! Read more. 5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful in black.

The Lumia 950 proves that there's a lot going for Windows 10 Mobile, though also a lot of work to be done. Its best trick is that it blows up to desktop-like proportions with Continuum, but it sorely needs apps. Dedicated Microsoft fans and willing beta testers need apply.. Microsoft Maps is 'Apple Maps bad'. Update : The big Windows 10 Anniversary Update has arrived on the Microsoft Lumia 950. But unlike desktops and laptops, the new software doesn't bring a whole lot of new goodies to Windows 10 Mobile.. In fact, if you go in cold and look for noticeable changes, you probably won't find any. However, there are some useful additions that will make using the Lumia 950 a little better.. Microsoft has added panorama mode to its stock Camera app – a fairly self-explanatory feature. It has also made the lock screen more informative by allowing for more at-a-glance notifications.. Lastly, Action Center has been updated to allow users to set the priority level of specific notifications so that you'll never miss what matters to you.. Whenever I look at the Microsoft Lumia 950, it scans my eyes, winks at me and unlocks with the words "Hello, Matt" – as if it knows me and wants to flirt. In a way, I feel like I recognize it, too. And, I won't lie, I kind of like it back … just not that much.. It reminds me of my first true smartphone, the Audiovox SMT 5600, a rebranded HTC Typhoon, before HTC even sold phones. It was small, so it looked like an everyday phone and, importantly for me at the time, it ran Windows Mobile 2003 SE.. More than a decade later, that's once again the appeal of the Lumia 950. It looks, feels and runs like your average-sized Android phone. Only the phone's operating system is Windows 10 Mobile , much to the benefit of Microsoft's diehard fans and PC holdouts.. This 5.2-inch phone does try a few interesting tricks so that it's not too basic. Its iris-scanning technology makes for a nifty unlock method and Continuum lets me scale the software to TV proportions for a useful desktop-like mode.. Lumia 950 lays the foundation for Windows 10 Mobile, and it's off to a better start, even if Lumia sales are dismal. I felt like that about the Audiovox SMT 5600, too, before the Redmond company blew it in mobile.. But now it's up against the best phones ever made, like the similarly-sized Samsung Galaxy S6 , iPhone 6S , LG G4 and Nexus 5X. Does it really have what it takes to win converts from iOS and Android, or keep Windows Phone 8.1 users from defecting? Clearly, it's not that simple.. The Microsoft Lumia 950 does its best impression of an average Android phone, almost as if it's trying to get you to buy it, take it home and say, "Too late! You're running Windows now." It reminds me a lot of my Nexus 5X in size, color and styling.. It doesn't measure out to be the thinnest or lightest phone of its size, with dimensions of 145 x 73.2 x 8.25mm and a weight of 150g. But it's still a nice fit for one-handed use with a little extra stretch. The boxy design is palm-friendly, and the thicker-than-normal bezel means you'll never accidentally touch the display.. You'll also never mistake this for a "premium" handset, either. The Lumia 950 is enveloped with a one-piece plastic shell that overlaps its Gorilla Glass 3-protected screen.. While the front is in a glossy black, the rear cover comes in matte white or matte black. Gone are the fun, vibrant colors of orange or lime green, as seen from last-generation Windows phones.. There's a microSD card slot and removable battery. Microsoft played it safe with colors, and it did the same with the microSD card slot and removable battery. It has both, while other phone manufacturers (namely Samsung) have axed these key features, much to the chagrin of vocal critics.. The microSD card and battery are easily accessible behind the removable plastic cover, a boon for professional users. Even the expandable storage slot can be accessed without removing the battery (but the same doesn't apply to the the stacked nano SIM card underneath of it).. USB-C has its ups and downs. Powering that 3,000mAh removable battery is a USB-C port on the bottom frame with fast charging capabilities. I still hate carrying around an extra cable, as much as I appreciate the reversible connection. It'll be easier once microUSB is further phased out of devices at the end of 2016.. The top of the Lumia 950 frame has a normal headphone jack, while the right side houses a power button and volume rocker, or more accurately the volume rocker and power button. They're in reverse order from many of today's phones, and that's how Nokia had them.. In fact, the only way to turn on this phone is to press that tiny power button on the right side.. The speaker is on back next to the 20MP camera and triple LED flash. I was hoping to see a pair of front-facing speakers, but there's one in the back of this phone, right next to the camera. At least the 20-megapixel (MP) camera is flanked by a fancy triple LED flash on its left side, and there's no significant camera bulge, like on the Nexus 5X.. Instead of the speakers I was asking for, I got something else that's long been on my wish list: a dedicated camera button. Truthfully, I've been asking for this for a while, to the point where I have gotten used to – and like – the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 double tap mechanic for launching the camera app, but I'll certainly take this, too.. Not the thinnest phone, but it does have a dedicated camera button. The words "Microsoft" are above the screen, and there's an on-screen Windows logo acting as the home button on the front. Around back, just off-center is another Windows logo. You'd never know it was a Microsoft phone without these, meaning Microsoft's fitting in just fine with cheap phones made of plastic these days.. Windows 10 Mobile has a dark theme turned on by default, and it really lets the deep blacks and Microsoft's familiar blues shine on this 5.2-inch AMOLED display.. A quad HD display with average brightness. The quad HD resolution at 2,560 x 1,440 doesn't hurt either, packing 564 pixels per inch (ppi) into this 16:9 display. That's sharper than the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus and ties the Galaxy S7 , but it doesn't come close to matching Apple and Samsung's brightness levels.. Brightness has become more important for me than resolution ever since we hit 1080p. I'm now more interested in seeing my smartphone in bright sunlight at the beach, not being able to appreciate extra pixels too small to detect with the naked eye. The Lumia 950 does well enough outdoors and has wide enough viewing angles, but it could be brighter at its max.. Me and our new car tech editor, Tuan. Whatever the brightness setting, I noticed this phone runs hot when in use for longer than a half hour. It's most evident when scrolling with my fingers using the touchscreen. The slower (and less problematic) Snapdragon 808 chip shouldn't run this hot, like a problematic Snapdragon 810, but maybe this is why the new Microsoft Lumia 950XL uses "liquid cooling.". The Lumia 950 doesn't have liquid cooling, but it does offer a handy glance screen. This shows limited information, like the time, date and simple notification icons, when the phone is asleep.. Like Motorola's slightly more advanced Moto Display, the static text here is in white against the otherwise turned off AMOLED display in black. It's not a battery hog, but this feature can be turned off in settings.. Windows 10 includes a one-handed-use mode, sort of like Apple's Reachability mode. It drops the entire screen down and stays there even when you tap into other menus. You have to tap the Windows home button to revert it or let the screen sit idle for a while.. This helps that 5.2-inch display feel a smidge smaller for critical, one-handed touchscreen tapping on the subway or tube.. Next Page Windows 10 Mobile.

Sometimes (quite offen, as a matter of fact) the telephone does not recognize the incoming number as an existing contact in my phone book, and the telephone shows me the mobile number on the screen, instead. of the name (and the picture) of the calling person. When I do restart my device, in the call history I can see the right thing - the name of the person who called me. The telephone is set to "collect" information only from my Gmail account. I tripple checked it!!! I have gone even further - I have deleted all my contacts in my Hotmail account, in order to avoid doubling contacts in two or. Please, help me solve that anoying issue.. I have the same question (3). Buy online, pick up in store.

Lovely bit of kit - now working well on Windows 10 - only negative is the double tap is rubbish - but hey - the side switch is right there anyway. Battery usage needs to be improved - have to research adjustments on google. Great having the power, speed AND memory capacity. Obviously a big step up from the Lumia 640. Only working on one sim card currently as Vodafone are rubbish at issuing the Nano sim card - 2 weeks and waiting.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars loved my Lumia from the very beginning. loved my Lumia from the very beginning...and still in love with it, nearly a year on using it....dual sim works perfectly, used it with many international cards ... 4G or even LTE connection in most of places... the only shame is that Windows doesn't offer many apps that are available for Androids and I phones. Other than that 5 * product. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars best phone ever. Best phone ever, very light and beautiful design yet still powerful. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Phone - A crying shame that the Windows Mobile platform is all but dead.... but that's what happens without the dreaded app support. You can't blame Microsoft (although some might). I've had my dual sim 950 for nearly a year (from eBay for less than £200), which replaced a single sim version. I also have a dual sim 640 and a single sim 830 upgraded to Windows 10 (shame that one was never available in a dual sim version). The 950 is my daily driver (I hang onto the other phones as back ups). At first sight, the 950 is a dull, plastic block of the phone with few redeeming features on the design front out of the box. Shame MS did not give it a metal frame like the 650 and the 830, but the decision not to do so may have been in the interest of saving weight. But, and this to my mind is a big "but", you can remove the back and replace it with whatever floats your boat (within reason). I have a Mozo cognac leather back on at the moment, which certainly moves the appearance up market, but I also have a couple of Terrapin backs. iPhones and sundry Androids (the gorgeous Samsung Galaxy Edge in particular) may look a lot nicer, but the glass backs render them fragile and their good looks have to hide behind protective cases. I have dropped my 950 several times and the only injury it suffered was a minor, barely visible mark on the screen when it landed face down on gravel. Talking of the screen, it has excellent resolution and Gorilla Glass protection with good colour adjustment in the settings menu. So, the iPhone 8 and its siblings have wireless charging, evidently made possible now by the (expensive to replace) glass back. The 950 has had wireless charging since it came out in 2015, as did the 930 and the 830 before it; none of these has a glass back... The removable back means that you can replace the battery, carry a spare, etc etc - you are not forced into buying a new phone because the manufacturer wants to charge you a fortune for a new battery and you therefore deem it not cost efficient. Incidentally, the 950 uses the same size battery (physical size that is) as the 640. Battery life is now a lot improved since the launch of the 950 and with average use I can get through a day and into the next. It is "only" 32Gb basic storage, but you get microSd storage as well if you want it. AND, you don't have to choose between microSD and the second sim - they have separate slots so you can have both in your phone at the same time :) Shame this is not possible with the likes of the Galaxy Edge. Of course you can forget about expandable storage and dual sim on an iPhone. Dual sim is very useful, especially when you are travelling, but of course it also means you can have one phone for business and personal. The camera, with its Nokia genes, is excellent and has optical image stabilisation, which is a boon for low-light photography. You get a choice between 19 mp and 8 mp on the main camera. The video mode is also very good. Ok, the opposition have now caught up and possibly surpassed the 950 in the camera department, but we are two years down the road from the 950's debut. The 950 has a headphone jack. The current trend towards doing away with this is lamentable as it limits what you can use. Also, the jack is on the top of the phone, not the bottom, which is surely the more sensible option if you are listening with the phone in your pocket. As a mobile OS, there is nothing wrong with Windows 10 in its latest form. It is the least resource hungry and most customisable of all the mobile operating systems. You can play around with the screen tiles to your heart's content and it's a breeze to uninstall apps. On the 950 with its 3Gb of RAM it breezes through tasks with no, or at the very least very little stutter. So, to sum up, you now have a flagship phone which can be bought for mid-range phone prices, with all the features and performance you are ever likely to sensibly need. Such a shame that the majority of people out there seem to be swayed by apps.... 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?.
