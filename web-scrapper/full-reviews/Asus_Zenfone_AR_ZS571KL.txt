Dropped it quite a few times already (in an incipio case), not a scratch. In fact I've almost no complaints about it, just the battery life could be better, especially when you use Tango.. One gets the impression the 8/128 is a myth.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great for developers and techies, maybe not for others. Offer Type: 6G/64G | Verified Purchase. Final Update (pending major unforeseen issues): Please note that I add updates to the top, so each of the updates lower came before the ones above them. I've been using the phone for 4 solid days. I still love it, although it has its issues. Here are my final review thoughts (but I will reply to any questions in the comments): (1) The included screen protector, although not great (see below), did its job when the phone was pushed against keys in my pocket by accident - slight scratch and a crack, but it protected the screen. I'll put one of the ones I ordered on now. (2) Aside from no specific T-Mobile functionality (no VoLTE, no WiFi Calling), this really works well as a phone. Good headphones (not audiophile by any means, but perfectly usable). Decent camera (at least as good as the better mid-pack 2017 phones, but not *quite* at flagship levels, although the ASUS Camera app has some excellent features). Same battery life, give or take, as the Pixel XL except when using Tango heavily. Doesn't get hot, but does get warm when using Tango, as expected. I still think other phones are better options if you don't want Tango, but rest assured that this is a really decent phone in addition to being a developer device, which is quite extraordinary given the *very* small manufacturing volumes. (3) I admit I'd have gotten the 8GB if it were available, although I can't really justify it - yes, you can do larger models, but I wonder if the difference would really matter. I suspect it might, but not for many people. (4) Please, *please* remember that Tango is not perfect. If you're scanning indoor, non-reflective items, it does a good job usually. If the things reflect, it doesn't, and sometimes when you least expect it - I was scanning some bathroom renovation work, and a new 2x8 was "too smooth" in parts and did not show up in scans for the bottom foot or so - it was like it wasn't there. Roughed it up with sandpaper a bit and... Still, I really enjoy using the phone as a scanner. I think it's amazing what it can do. I think, in terms of working with augmented reality as opposed to trying to get life-like scans, it works incredibly well. And the scans usually turn out well, too. I just wanted people to understand, before they shell out $600-$700, that this won't recreate things perfectly. Also, you need to understand that ARKit (iOS 11) apps will dwarf Tango ones in number and features *except* for scanning and *except* for incorporating the real world, simply because there will be a million (or more) times as many ARKit-enabled iOS devices. they can't scan like this does. And it will even scan in the dark. Take that, iOS! Summary: No buyer's remorse. Great for those wanting to try out Tango (which is cool but imperfect). Daydream works in it exactly the same as on my Pixel XL, but I tend not to use it because I don't tend to carry the goggles around. Extraordinarily well-built phone for such a boutique market size. --------------------------------------------------- Update (day 2) I'm bumping this to five stars (no, no one asked me to, and yes, I paid full price for this). Why? Because it's a great Tango device - not perfect, but the best one yet made and, as well, a good phone. Given the very, very small manufacturing quantities compared to almost any other phone, I can forgive the issues, which, to me, are: * Not fully supported by T-Mobile (no WiFi calling, no VoLTE). * Some fit and finish trivial issues (adhesive smudge on fingerprint button [easily removed]), somewhat sharp-ish edges on the back, etc. I'll never like it as much as Google's, but it's not as bad as I first perceived it to be. * 7.0 instead of 7.1 or (soon) 8.x. Given that this has Android 7.0 when 7.1 has been out since 2016, I have no hope of this ever getting an update. Maybe it will, but I don't expect it. Still, as a Google partner phone, I wish it at least came with 7.1. So, yeah, it's not a perfect phone, which is why I originally gave it 4 stars. for a phone that has a total production run that is less than the number of iPhones produced every 10 minutes (that's probably literally true), I'm willing to forgive these things. As a phone for the average consumer, sure, this is a 4-star phone (works well, but a bit pricey and some rough edges). for people who like working with Tango, this is so much better than what they've had before that I need to give it 5 stars. It's a Tango device that's the same size as my Pixel XL Battery life is actually, now that I'm on my second day with using it, as good as the Pixel's when I'm not running Tango. Look, Tango isn't perfect, and there's a lot of improvement to be made, but... it's actually usable with this - finally! I wrote an app specifically for the Tango tablet to consolidate point clouds to try to give me reasonable detail in a scan, and it took a lot of post-processing to run, and it worked only marginally well - the tablet was not good at maintaining spatial position. The ZenFone AR replicated (and improved) on work that with half a minute of scanning. No special app, no off-phone post processing. It's just that much better than the tablet. I'm sorry for the long review and all the updates, but I figure that very few people will actually be buying (and therefore reviewing) this. I'll answer any comments or questions you might have. Yes, it's expensive, and it's not the ideal - I would love to be able to make photorealistic 3D models with it that worked at scales smaller than a room. What you get, now, is sort of like what you'd get if you had to build everything out of LEGO blocks (not the fancy parts) and then rounded the edges - it works at scale but not up close. However, that's where Tango is at, now. Not perfect, but state of the art for consumer devices, and that includes ARKit in iDevices. For that matter, neither is ARKit. But Tango's sensors let you do some really cool things, and if you want to dive into development, this supports the latest and greatest Tango versions (of course). If all you want is a scanner, get the Intel Euclid kit for $400. But if you want a decent phone (upper-midrange, in almost all aspects aside from Tango) that is *also* a really cool scanner and location-aware device, then get this. ---------- Update (even later in the day): I've linked sample scan files (in a comment). That's an example of what you can do with the free apps out right now. In theory, it can do better, and I want to work on that. But the example I listed in the comments gives you a good idea of what you can expect for a quick 30-second-or-so scan of an area. I dunno, maybe it was a minute, but it was definitely brief. ---------- Update (later in the day): I’ve altered some things stylistically to be more like my Pixel, and that’s helping. Turning off the incredibly oversaturated screen colors (Settings->Display->Screen Color Mode->Standard) was helpful. T-Mobile works well - about as well as on the Pixel XL or iPhone SE, based on limited testing. I miss double-tapping the power to turn on the camera (Pixel), but the gesture of drawing a ‘c’ on the screen when idle to turn it on works well (Settings->Zen Motion->Touch Gesture). All in all, I was at first a little hesitant (I didn’t like the skin/settings, the capacitive buttons instead of on-screen ones, etc.), but it’s growing on me. With the micro-SD capability, I think the lower-end model is likely the better option for most… I doubt the $100 extra would really be worth it in most use cases. Obviously, if you’re not specifically interested in Tango (remember: Apple’s ARKit will be in iOS 11 on all reasonably new phones/tablets), this isn’t for you. But, if you *are* interested in Tango, this is the phone to get. ————————— Original review: ————————— Note: I'll add to this review as time goes on. I received the phone a few hours ago and have set it up and played with it. Summary: this is the best Tango platform by far, but that's a low hurdle. Works quickly and well for that (all things considered). A bit niche for anyone not keenly interested in Tango. ASUS' skin is annoying (to me, at least). Lots of things included with the phone. Those not interested in Tango should look elsewhere, as this phone, ignoring the Tango abilities, isn’t as good as similarly priced options. Background: I've owned the Tango tablet for years. I also bought (and returned) the Phab 2 Pro. I've written some Tango apps (for my own use, playing around). I bought this phone specifically for Tango because I want to continue to write apps, and the Tango tablet is just too old to really allow me to do much with it. I really wanted to like the Phab 2 Pro, but it was (IMO) not even remotely worth what they were charging (too big, too slow, etc.). I'm also a Nexus/Pixel owner, so this is my first non-Google Android phone in a long time (since the OnePlus One). Also, I have an iPhone SE and have played with ARKit (Apple's Augmented Reality kit, coming in iOS 11). First impressions: (1) They give you everything you need to get going - not just the phone and charger, but fairly nice headphones (and there's a jack!), a glass screen cover, and a plastic case for the back. Compact, given all you get, and nicely made. (3) The phone is TINY for a Tango device - for all intents and purposes, it's exactly the same size as my Pixel XL - so: much smaller than either the Tango tablet or the Phab 2 Pro. Small enough to use this as your daily driver. The screen is very nice, the single speaker is loud and clear, headphones work well, etc. Nicely built but had a few tiny smudges (adhesive, it seemed) that took a while to clean completely. Minor to most, annoying to me. The leather (or leather-like?) back feels great, but the phone edges are a bit sharp, so I’m using the supplied case. (4) The fingerprint scanner works quite well - I’ve never had a miss after trying it dozens of times. I’m sure it’ll flake on occasion, but 100% so far gives me confidence. (5) Setup was easy, as it always is with an Android phone and a Google account, but… WHY ASUS?? WHY??? The skin they use seems to be meant for small children. It’s terrible, at least to someone used to Nexus/Pixel devices. Everything is colorful - and all different colors. Notifications, etc., are everywhere and too big. It all just seems very… 2010. I added the Google Now Launcher to help a bit, but there’s nothing to be done about the Settings and such. I’m sure I’ll adjust, but I wish they’d just have gone with stock Android and/or looked more like Google. (6) You should order a new glass screen protector. The one they supply is… OK. But I could not get it to install properly, and I’ve installed a *lot* of glass screen protectors. It doesn’t really want to lay flat, the plastic cover on the back was adhered way too well, so it added static when it was removed, pulling in some dust I couldn’t remove, etc. Again, it’ll work, but you might want another. The clear rear case is fine. Both, though, are very nice as included accessories. Oh, and some wipes, because none are included here. (6) The power and volume button placement are swapped from the Pixel, but it’s not a real issue. Just awkward for me as I go back and forth. Not Pixel/iPhone/Galaxy level of quality, but perfectly serviceable. (8) The SIM/micro SD tray (you can also use it for two nano SIMs if you don’t want to use a micro SD card) works, but it’s really flimsy plastic. I’d not plan on opening it up often. (9) Tango is fantastic on this. I’m used to the clunky tablet, sure, but I am very impressed. The Tango Constructor app (it’s on the Play Store) is vastly faster than on the tablet and works well. Other apps also work well - much better than on the tablet. But what really sold me? I’d opened up the Dinosaurs Among Us app and took a photo of the screen (NOT the one included with this review). I went back to the couch, set the phone down, and wrote the top half of this. I then noticed the photo I’d taken was blurry, so I got the Zenfone out of the couch cushion it had slipped beside, took it back over to the kitchen, went to reopen the app, and realized it was still open **and the Archaeoperyx was in the same place I’d put it before**. It didn’t lose position information at all, even after slipping into the couch 20 feet away ten minutes before. (10) Battery life: it seems like this will last about an average amount of time *unless* you use Tango apps, which of course you will. Solution: bring an external battery with you. (11) From a developer’s point of view: this is on 7.0 (not 7.1, sadly) but does allow the use of the latest Tango development code, unlike the tablet. All in all, it’s a very nice form factor. I’m unsure if the extra 2GB of RAM and 64GB of storage is worth the extra $100, but I didn’t want to wait a month to find out. (12) WHY BUY THIS? In a nutshell, 95% of you would be better off with an iPhone (or iPad) and ARKit (built into iOS 11) if you want to play with AR, and 99% of you would be better off with a different Android phone in this price range if you don’t care about Tango/AR. Remember: ARKit is great for *consumption* of AR. It does a very good job of tracking phone movement and of finding flat places to put your AR goodies. But it’s terrible at *creation* - you won’t make 3D models with it (at least yet). Tango, on the other hand, *can* create - it can scan rooms, create models, etc. It knows where walls and furniture are, for example, and ARKit doesn’t do well with those. It’s really oriented around finding flat surfaces for things to be placed on. But, on the other hand, there will be orders of magnitude more AR content for iOS than for Tango, because there are about a million times as many iOS devices as Tango ones (literally). Having used both: ARKit is easier to code for and very nice visually. Tango is technically superior but a bit more of a pain. I will likely end up using Tango to create and ARKit to consume. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars hang onto this phone with your life.. Offer Type: 8G/128G | Verified Purchase. on the spec sheet, it is too bad that i have had to replace it 2 times in about 3 months. im dealing with a Purple bleed this time starting from the sim tray, first one was from the corner, i have been researching this and it appears that this is a common issue with this phone, even dropping it from a short distance, days later you see damage to the screen, even with a case on. thank goodness there a 12 month warranty on this phone, ill keep sending it in for the same damn thing if i have to for the next remaining months. Asus, I personally think asus should do a recall of this phone and re-evaluate the layout of this phone, it is a great concept, it has great technology, and with it being a thin phone, you might have packed a little bit too much into the frame therefore when it gets a "shock" something contacts the amoled panel and causes it to warp. But since this is not an exploding battery you won't do a recall.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent device all around - Phone, AR, Tango, Speed, and overall experience. Offer Type: 6G/64G | Verified Purchase. ** Edit ** - After a week of real usage, I keep my 5 star rating. The battery is excellent, now granted I came from a Galaxy S5 but I had a new battery in it, and the life of it didnt come close to the Asus. One day with heavy conference calls and some playing with the device I have only 7% by the time I went to bed, but that was impressive. My average day with playing, texts and some calls, I go to bed with 35-40%. The quick charge took the 7% up to 100% in about an hour. It has yet to lag and, for once, vendor software is almost welcomed on the Asus - Their boost program is cool - click it in the quick settings and it frees up RAM, which I suggest doing before doing any 3D scanning attempts or even AR/VR games. I picked up a Daydream headset just to try it - Best buy had them for $59 for a week - so Why not... Full disclosure - I do have a Vive on a 1080 card - so no comparison there, and its probably why I am critical of Daydream (or Gear VR for that matter). If I had nothing but Daydream for VR it would be a cool toy, but not something I would play a lot with - but thats likely due to missing the content I have on the Vive. Some of the VR experiences are cool and the controller works well enough - but again, Im used to Vive Trackers which are just plain excellent at tracking. For the $59 to play, it was worth it. Im very happy with the camera tests so far - Nice pictures all around and Im still shocked at how quick the laser focus is with Auto mode. My Galaxy S5 in auto mode was so slow at focusing - uselessly slow - So I was always in sports mode just to take any picture. The Asus camera is nice all around and the manual settings are fairly impressive for a phone (Its not an SLR, by any means .. but I wouldnt expect it to compare to a SLR camera). I did go to the modified Pixel Launcher rather than Asus' launcher - The Asus launcher is good, but Im just used to Googles Launcher since they releases the Google Now Launcher years ago on the on the play store. My mom has the last Asus phone with the default skin/launcher and she loves it - so this is all opinion. Calls work great - and the bluetooth to the car is fast and 100% connection now (over my Galaxy) - but again, thats an older phone so its not a far comparison. -------- Below is my Original Review ------------ I've been waiting for a reasonably sized Tango phone for some time - something that was a phone size, daydream support, good camera, and of course Tango. I did buy the Lenovo Phab 2 Tango Phablet, but never used it as a phone since it was just too big - which I knew when I bought it, it was purchased for Tango only. Now to the Asus - Its a quick phone, great screen and how many vendors include a Glass screen protector for the front, and an acrylic (Plastic?) back protector right out of the box. I couldn't transfer my Galaxy S5 Sim, as I assumed beforehand, since it was too big but AT&T took about 15 minutes to get me the new sim when I stopped in the store (FYI, they charge $5 for a sim now... Obviously this is a huge upgrade from my Galaxy S5 which I never had an issue with, but after so many years it was just starting to have a few issues, mostly with bluetooth and my car stereo which was annoying. The Asus skin isn't bad, I may still switch to the pixel launcher or some third party launcher - but thats just a preference and Ive used the google launcher since you could sideload it. The back button is on the opposite side of where Samsung puts it, so just another small change after having an S3 and S5 - so Samsung for 5 or 6 years. The Fingerprint sensor is lightning quick - I usually disabled locked screens due to the unlocking and just being a pain at the wrong time. The fingerprint scan is so fast and you can store 5 different prints, so scan your finger holding the phone differently to handle any situation. The regular camera for daylight pictures is vibrant and quick to focus (it should be with the tech) - I do want to see it in action in darker situations, but in some darker rooms to test the results were fairly good - Not SLR good, but good. The AR aspect is what I expected - the Lenovo handled AR fine as well. Tango 3D Scanning works VERY well and the limitations right now are software based, not hardware based - Scandy is trying to address many of those issues, but their app isnt there yet. If you want to use a floor plan for a VR game / etc, RTAB-Map handles this very well, and Matterport scenes scans well too. Im sure as more people start to use these apps, they will get more attention and just get better and better. Right now, dont expect to 3D scan something and then export as an STL to 3D print anything.. Soon, just not yet without some extra clean-up work on your side. AR games are cool - theres a new one called Hologrid Tango - Its like Star Wars Holochess - its a strategy game that puts a board anywhere you want and its just fun. As with the Phab 2 - the Lowes app, Wayfair app, and Gap applications are all cool. The measuring program is awesome - Just click point 1, then point 2 and you have your measurement (If you are in the US, change the measurements to Imperial if you want inches/feet) I added a 64GB MicroSD since I had one Im not using - its the lightning fast version from Samsung that used to transfer 100+MB/sec on my Surface Book, so with the scanning Ill do, I wanted more space and the speed will help. All other aspects are excellent - Sound quality is great for a phone, it pairs with my car without any issues each time, the asus keyboard takes time to get used to but like all Android devices you can change that. I was worried about the size before the phone arrived - I always thought larger than say 5.1 or 5.25 screens were as large as I could carry easy in my pocket. Since Asus did a pretty job of shrinking the bezel, so its about as wide as the Galaxy s5 and about 1/2 taller - so really, not too big at all but gives me a 5.7" screen over my old 5.1" screen. It didnt take long to get used to that :) As I 3D Scan more in different scenarios, Ill update my review. I was working with Scandy before their release and I have some more input for them from my results on the Phab2 and the Zenphone AR - maybe some that will help them.... This should be a killer portable 3D Scanner - but right now, its just a cool toy 3D scanner for objects, for spaces and point in cloud, its pretty good as it is.. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Faulty vibration motor. Offer Type: 6G/64G | Verified Purchase. Good device generally (camera not as good as my old LG G4) but more valuable for me due to the Tango depth sensor capabilities. As other users reported mine also started vibrating by itself. I discovered that if the phone is pressed with two fingers (index on screen and thumb near the bottom left corner of the camera plate) the vibration motor would start vibrating. It seems there's a faulty short there. When the phone is in the pocket, a slight bend (e.g. when you flex your leg) causes the phone to start vibrating. Was this review helpful to you?. So I got this phone today and buy fare the best phone I have purchased its does everything it says it can do. 5.0 out of 5 stars Has everything and more that you want in a phone.. Purchasing this phone has been the biggest disappointment I have had with telephones. 1.0 out of 5 stars Stay Clear. One of the best phone ever I have. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. It arrives without the VR lens, but it has a protective package that was very usefull, i love the cell,. 5.0 out of 5 stars Best Cell I bought. Best phone I've purchased so far. First, it has all of the features I require in a phone. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great product by ASUS. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. My normal practice, when purchasing high-tech toys, is to read the reviews. I will be honest I was a bit nervous about purchasing this phone because it didn't receive as high a... 5.0 out of 5 stars I will be honest I was a bit nervous about purchasing this phone because it didn't receive as high a score as I would have liked but I purchased it because every other ASUS product .... So the features the phone gives you are awesome. Tango is pretty cool but there aren't very many AR apps out there at the moment. The camera is really good as well. 2.0 out of 5 stars Camera and features are solid but build quality is atrocious.. There are so many minor issues with this phone but I was fine with them as they were little things (i.e. 1.0 out of 5 stars Standard music files will not work - Tango no longer supported. UPDATE 2: I chose to return the phone. There is nothing wrong with the phone itself. It's perfect for someone looking for a near stock Android device with a few interesting... 3.0 out of 5 stars Awesome phone ruined by Google's (and Asus') lack of commitment.

Asus ZenFone AR (ZS571KL) Smartphone Review. Manuel Masiero ( translated by Martin Jungowski), 11/08/2017. Android Smartphone Touchscreen. Asus's ZenFone AR combines Augmented Reality with Virtual Reality: it is, after all, the first smartphone ever certified for Google Tango as well as Daydream. The most interesting question is whether or not its AR- and VR-features justify its high price of approximately $770..

Asusâs ZenFone AR is noteworthy for two separate and completely independent reasons. Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 MSM8996 Pro powered 5.7-inch (WQHD OLED) Android 7.0 smartphone is the first smartphone ever to be equipped with up to 8 GB of RAM. Its second distinctive feature is much more interesting though.. According to Asus, the ZenFone AR is the first smartphone ever to be certified for Google Tango as well as Google Daydream. Thus, it is not only capable of adding virtual objects in real time to its recorded image stream (augmented reality) but also produce a virtual reality output thereof via the optional Daydream 3D virtual reality glasses. This feature set comes at a high price, though: our review unit, equipped with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal storage currently sells for around $770.. We have already witnessed an Android phoneâs first steps into the AR world with the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. Unfortunately, due to its weak and slow hardware it was unable to cope with the high demands of augmented reality; a problem we do not expect to see with the ZenFone AR thanks to its much more powerful SoC. Our review is going to reveal how well that turned out. In addition to the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, we are also going to compare the ZenFone to similarly equipped high-end smartphones, such as the Apple iPhone 8 , the. OnePlus 5 , and the Samsung Galaxy S8 ..

The ZenFoneâs aluminum case is covered by Corning Gorilla Glass 4 at the front and roughened leather at the back. While the leather does provide extra grip, it feels more like cheap plastic instead. The custom-made camera module named TriCam developed and designed specifically for Tango AR and Daydream VR is located at the rear as well. It is comprised of a 23 MP main camera as well as two additional cameras for motion detection and depth of field calculation. It protrudes slightly from the case resulting in a minor yet noticeable wobble when placed face up on a table.. At 8.95 mm the ZenFone AR is thicker than almost all of its competitors. Only the 10.7 mm (~0.42 in) thick 6.4-inch Lenovo Phab 2 is even bulkier. Nevertheless, the phone feels very slender and leaves a very decent high-quality impression thanks to its narrow consistent gaps and sturdy chassis.

According to Asus the ZenFone AR is equipped with. SoC that has been optimized for Googleâs augmented reality technology Tango. GPU and an LPDDR4 memory controller with access to at least 6 GB of RAM. Regular apps do not really benefit from that much RAM just yet. Tango apps, on the other hand, should benefit immensely, for which the. (Snapdragon 652 MSM8976, 4 GB of RAM) is living proof: it supports Tango as well, but in our review turned out to be overwhelmed by augmented reality applications.. Officially, the ZenFone AR is also going to be available with 8 GB of RAM. However, Asus has yet to clarify in which countries and regions this model is going to be available and when. As of November 2017, only the 6 GB model is available in Europe and the US.. It is equipped with fast UFS 2.0 memory ranging from 64 GB all the way to 256 GB. Our review unit was equipped with 128 GB of storage, of which 110 GB were user accessible out of the box.. Theoretically, storage expansion via a microSD card with up to 2 TB is supported as well. However, to date, no microSD cards larger than 400 GB are available. With the microSD card inserted into the Nano SIM / Micro SD tray the devices loses its Dual SIM capabilities. Installing apps on the microSD card was not possible on the ZenFone AR since it formatted the SD card as removable storage that can only be used for storing media files.. The USB Type-C port supports USB 2.0 as well as USB-OTB and Quick Charge 3.0. A high-resolution sound chip (up to 24 Bit/192 kHz) is also built-in.. left: Nano SIM/Micro SD hybrid slot. button: 3.5-mm audio, microphone, USB 2.0 Type-C, speaker. Googleâs Android 7.0 operating system has been modified by Asus to some degree. For example, the ZenFone AR comes with Asusâs own user interface ZenUI 3.0. At the time of review (October 2017) the latest security patch level available was August 2017. Thus, the phone was already out-of-date.. The phoneâs focus is clearly on Tango. Googleâs Tango app can be found right there on the home screen and serves as both, AR app store and AR app launcher. Some AR apps are already preloaded on the phone.. Slingshot Island: a virtual island under attack.. But what exactly are Tango apps? Basically, a Tango app is an Android application presenting one or several overlays to the camera viewfinderâs live image. Most of them are mere gimmicks at this point. Let us take â Slingshot Island â for example: it transforms your smartphone into a slingshot that allows you to sling rocks at virtual castles in your surroundings. Some educational value can be found in Solar Simulator, an app that presents you with a to-scale solar system model and allows you to travel back and forth between the planets. The measure app, on the other hand, is a virtual tape measure: you set a starting and an end point and get the distance between the two shown on your screen.. BMW i Visualiser: taking a virtual seat in an electric car, for example the BMW i3.. And while most Tango apps are gimmicks at this point, some of them are excellent showcases for the high potential of AR applications in the near future. For example, BMWâs i Visualizer allows you to take a virtual seat inside a BMW i3, i3s, or i8 and fiddle around with its controls (e.g. turn on the lights or open the doors). And it gets even more interesting when combined with Googleâs Daydream View Headset 3D glasses: that way you can inspect the BMW models very closely and realistically prior to purchasing one. Thanks to the phones high-resolution WQHD display virtual quality and the subsequent 3D effect are top notch.. Dressing and virtual furniture apps, such as Dressing Room, Loweâs, Wayfair, or iStaging offer a similar experience. Dressing Room, for example, allows you to dress up a mannequin modelled after your exact measurements to your liking and purchase the clothes right away. Loweâs, Wayfair, and iStaging allow you to place virtual furniture and decorative items in your rooms to see how well (or bad) they would actually look in that particular space. Unfortunately, these apps lack a zoom feature and virtually furnishing a small room can become quite finicky.. Measure - a virtual measuring tape for your smartphone. iStaging - virtual furniture fitting room. All this is possible thanks to the ZenFone ARâs dual camera system. The cameras memorize the three-dimensional coordinates of objects very accurately and allow the user to literally walk around the virtual items in order to look at them from all sides. Occasional hiccups include a slight shift in proportions between the real environment and the virtual object in question, and those can most often be solved by simply moving the smartphone slightly thereby changing the viewing angle between the camera and the virtual object.. Measuring distances worked surprisingly well if the two end points were within 2 m (approx. 7 ft) of the user and assuming the aiming was performed accurately. But even then the measuring app did sometimes focus on the wrong spot rendering the measurement obsolete. In addition, the app had trouble with objects that were farther away (more than 10 m/33 ft).. Overall, the AR experience with the ZenFone AR was much better than the AR experience with the. Not once did we experience slowdowns or graphical glitches in Tango apps, and while the ZenFone AR did get noticeably warm up, it never reached the point where it got uncomfortable to hold. However, surface temperatures become less of an issue anyway once the phone is installed in virtual reality glasses.. There is only one real downside: the number of Tango apps is still fairly low, and no more than 30 apps and games are available at this point. Google keeps an up-to-date list of Tango apps. The rest of the preloaded apps are either Google apps or Asusâs own apps, such as ZenCircle or ZenTalk, and a small selection of games and apps that luckily can all be uninstalled.. As of today, only 30 Tango apps are available for download in Google's Play Store.. must be purchased separately: Google's Daydream View headset. 11, the ZenFone AR supports downstream and upstream transfer speeds of up to 600 MBit/s and 75 MBit/s, respectively. During our review period, Vodafone mobile reception was flawless, even in rural areas. Thanks to support for a total of 23 network bands, the phone should be able to get a signal pretty much anywhere on this planet. However, those of us who require even more connectivity worldwide are better off with the. The latter supports up to 34 network bands.. In terms of Wi-Fi, the ZenFone AR supports 802.11a/b/g/n/ac and is thus capable of utilizing the lesser used 5 GHz band as well. In our test connected to our Linksys EA8500 reference router, it reached a very good 340 MBit/s (RX), and was thus about as fast as the. Due to a lack of MIMO antennas, it could not keep up with the likes of. Samsung's Galaxy S8 , the OnePlus 5, or Appleâs iPhone 8..

Location services support positioning via GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou, and position lock was obtained fairly quickly, even indoors with an accuracy of 6 m (~20 ft; 5 m/~16 ft accuracy outdoors).. We examine a smartphoneâs GPS accuracy on an 8.8 km (~5.5 mi) long bike ride, where we compare it to a professional Garmin Edge 500 GPS. The ZenFone AR did very well in this test. At the end of the ride, the difference between the two was just 50 m (~55 yd), and occasionally, the ZenFone AR was more accurate than the Garmin Edge 500. Thus, the ZenFone AR is quite suitable for everyday navigation purposes.. Call Quality was more than decent when used conventionally or on speakerphone regardless of the opposite sideâs connection (landline / mobile). Flat down on the table the ZenFone AR was quite usable on speakerphone thanks to the position of the speaker on the side.. In case two SIM cards are installed, one of the two can be selected as the primary SIM card for voice calls, text messages, and data. Both SIM slots offer support for 2G/3G/4G, although only one SIM card can be connected to an LTE network at a time.. HDR photo (16 Megapixel, 16:9) taken with the main camera. The ZenFone ARâs main camera features a 4K capable 23 MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture, 4-way optical image stabilization (OIS), three-way electronic image stabilization (EIS), a dual LED flash and a 77 Â° field of view. The sensor behind all this is Sonyâs 1/2.6-inch Exmor RS IMX318.. Asus refers to the main rear camera as TriCam due to the fact that two extra cameras are installed in addition to the main camera. The first is used for motion detection, the second for measuring the distance to and between objects and general depth of field visualization. All three cameras are required for Googleâs Tango. The main 23 MP camera is accompanied by an 8 MP shooter at the front.. In bright daylight, the main cameraâs image quality is very decent (see scenes 1 and 2), with vibrant colors and a high dynamic range. However, Unlike its competitors, some photos taken with the ZenFone AR tend to lack sharpness and fine details. Our sample photo (scene 3) seems blurry at first sight already, and upon closer inspection it lacks details quite visibly. 4K/3840x2160 @ 30 FPS) is very decent.. The extensive camera app is noteworthy. It allows access to all relevant settings, including manual shutter mode, bokeh, and face detection. The app also supports raw photography (extension: DNG) and its image improvement algorithms work their wonders on the front-facing 8 MP camera as well. Unfortunately, the front-facing camera supports only 1280x720 @ 20 FPS video recording.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. We also test every camera under controlled lighting conditions using the X-Rite ColorChecker Passport to determine color accuracy and a standardized test chart to determine focus and image sharpness.. Colors are slightly oversaturated, but only barely so. Generally speaking colors are on the bright side, which ensures very vivid high-contrast photos. Image sharpness is not the best, and our test chart turned out to be something of a challenge for the ZenFone AR. Even at the very center, the point where most cameras have no problems whatsoever, the photos lacked sharpness. This became particularly obvious when inspecting the transitions between the edges. On the other hand, the overall focus remained mostly unchanged for the entire image, and the color gradient was very accurate.. ColorChecker Passport: reference color at the bottom of each quadrant.. test chart overview (click for original). The ZenFone AR comes with a modular charger, a USB Type-C cable, a USB Type-C to Type-A adapter, a SIM tool, headphones, a quick start guide, and a warranty booklet.. In addition, our review unit also came with the optional. for a three-dimensional virtual reality experience. The glasses are not sold by Asus directly, but can be obtained through various retail channels for around $75.. While European models are sold with a limited 24-month warranty, US models include a limited 12-month warranty.. The 10-point multitouch touchscreen feels pleasantly silky to the touch, and does not suffer from any noticeable input delay, either in the middle or on the sides and edges of the display. The usual Android buttons for back and tabs are illuminated soft-touch buttons while the physical home button houses the fingerprint reader. Like the volume rocker and the power button it feels very sturdy with firm feedback. The default keyboard is Asusâs ZenUI keyboard, but it can be easily replaced with other keyboards available through Googleâs Play Store.. ZenFone ARâs WQHD (2560x1440) Super AMOLED panel is protected by Gorilla Glass 4, and the phoneâs screen to body ratio is 79%. Considering the comparatively small display size, the resulting pixel density is an impressive 515 PPI, and individual pixels are not distinguishable with the naked eye anymore. Due to its OLED nature, each pixel can be individually enabled or disabled, meaning that the display does not require a uniform backlight anymore. The displayâs maximum brightness of 341 nits is not bad, but it is also nothing to write home about considering that it got bested by every single one of its competitors by a significant margin. The real-world APL50 test with evenly distributed bright and dark areas results in a maximum brightness of 402 nits, and the ZenFone ARâs brightness distribution is very decent at 90%.. Unfortunately, the display flickers at a low 231.5 Hz, meaning that it is being turned off and on again 231.5 times per second. Sensitive users might notice this low-frequency flickering. On the other hand, the display comes with a blue light filter and a very low minimum brightness of 7.06 nits, both of which help to reduce eyestrain in the evenings and in low-light environments.. 362 cd/m² 346 cd/m² 328 cd/m² 352 cd/m² 338 cd/m² 326 cd/m² 354 cd/m² 337 cd/m² 325 cd/m². 90 % Center on Battery: 338. cd/m²) ΔE Color 3.7 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 4.9 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.25.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM detected 231.5 Hz. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. The display backlight flickers at 231.5.

This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Thanks to the high-contrast display, colors are very vivid and fresh. Using the CalMAN software in combination with a spectrophotometer allows us to determine the panelâs color accuracy and coverage. In both color spaces color representation was fairly accurate, although DeltaE for grayscales was slightly above its ideal value of 3. We were also able to determine a slight blue tint in both color spaces, which turned out to be more pronounced in the sRGB space than in the AdobeRGB space. However, it was barely, if at all noticeable in everyday use.. While the displayâs overall maximum brightness certainly was not the best, it was good enough to remain usable even in very bright ambient light. Direct sunlight, however, rendered the display useless and required us to either find a shady spot or to realign the phone accordingly. Overall, the ZenFone AR is definitely usable outdoors.. Viewing angles are very decent and the display does not dim even when viewed from acute angles. As is quite common for OLED displays, a slight green tint appears when viewed from an angle. However, it remained largely unobtrusive when viewed at normal, aka not too acute angles.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

With a maximum sound level of 88.4 dB(A), the ZenFone ARâs mono speaker located at the bottom of the phone can become fairly loud. Mids and Highs are nicely balanced, but as usual the smartphone lacks bass. Accordingly, the soundscape is rather tinny and thin, but certainly sufficient for the occasional YouTube or Spotify experience.

Power consumption was a mixed bag. On the one hand, with only 1.24 W on average the ZenFone AR was only bested by the. Samsung Galaxy S8 in idle power consumption. On the other, its 7.71W under load were more than every single competitor except for the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro ..

Consequently, battery life was only mediocre at best. Despite the ZenFone ARâs 3.300 mAh battery, which should in theory last for a very long time, the device fell behind its competitors in every single test thanks to, among others, its high power consumption under load. It is also worth noting that Tango apps are particularly power hungry. The phone lasted for just 7:24 hours in our real-world Wi-Fi test, and was surpassed even by the far from long-running. In other words: 7:24 h was only good enough for last place.. The only real consolation is that the ZenFone AR supports Quick Charge 3.0, and can thus be charged from near empty to 60% in less than 40 minutes as promised by the manufacturer. A full cycle from completely drained (powered off) to 100% takes around 1:45 hours.. Idle (without WLAN, min brightness) 24h. NBC WiFi Websurfing Battery Test 1.3 7h.

Review unit courtesy of Asus Germany.. No doubt: the ZenFone AR is the first smartphone to run Googleâs augmented reality Tango apps smoothly. However, given the relatively low selection of apps (around 30) - most of which are gimmicks to boot - in its current state Tango is far from being a must-have feature. The question is: are you willing to spend almost $800 plus tax for this rather poor AR experience? We suspect that for most users, Tango is not going to be a major factor when considering the ZenFone AR, especially since Googleâs Daydream VR glasses are not included and must be purchased separately.. Purchasing the ZenFone AR only because of Google Tango is not going to be worth it. Augmented reality aside, what remains is a decent yet overpriced smartphone.. At almost half the price the. LG G6 is just as fast as the ZenFone AR. Even Asusâs TriCam was incapable of impressing us. Yes, the resulting photos are certainly decent, but they are far from being the best. In addition, battery life is very poor and the ZenFone AR runs out of juice comparatively quickly..

Google AR Tango enabled and VR Daydream-ready! What is the ability of the world's first smartphone, the ZenFone AR, with 8GB RAM like?. It has three cameras but remains to be the same size as the iPhone 7 Plus!. You can experience things you have never experienced with the Tango AR!. The ZenFone AR is a high performance smartphone even without AR.. The ZenFone AR, a SIM free smartphone from ASUS, is the world's first smartphone that supports both Google AR platform "Tango" and VR platform "Daydream.". Also, this is the world's first smartphone with 8GB RAM. (Note that the 64GB model has 6GB RAM.) Considering that even the iPhone 7 Plus has only 3GB RAM, you can see how high performance 8GB RAM means. We tried this smartphone with two of the "world's first" elements to see its ability.. What is the ability of the world's first Tango enabled and Daydream-ready smartphone, the ZenFone AR like?. The Google Tango is an AR computing platform that enables users to use motion tracking, depth perception, and area learning on mobile devices with Android. AR came to be known widely with the Pokémon GO which shows Pokémon as if they were in real life, but apps compatible with the Tango enables users to experience AR in a far higher level than the Pokémon GO. However, to work apps that support Tango on mobile devices, they require three cameras; a main camera with high resolution, a depth sensing camera and a motion tracking camera. At the moment only the ZenFone AR and the PHAB2 Pro from Lenovo have them.. ZenFone AR is equipped with a TriCam system consisting of three cameras; 23MP camera on its back (left top), motion tracking camera (left bottom) and depth sensing camera (right top).. The PHAB2 Pro, the world's first Tango enabled smartphone released before this, has AR but it was big in size. It gained good reputation from app developers, but it was difficult to say even as a compliment that it was suitable for daily use for average users. On the other hand, the ZenFone AR does not only support Tango but also VR platform Daydream, and yet it only has the size of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, which means it is compact enough for users to use it with one hand. As for its look, it has leather like finish except for where the rear camera is, and it achieves high designability.. The ZenFone AR is 158.98 x 77.7 x 4.6 - 8.95 (HWD mm) and it weighs about 170g. Its 5.7-inch Super AMOLED display with 2560 x 1440 resolution achieves high contrast bright colors.. The home button with a finger print sensor located at the front bottom is a physical button.. The charging terminal is the latest USB-Type C. Also, it has an audio jack on its bottom and it is compatible with Hi-Res audio. Unlike the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, you can listen to music using an earphone while charging without a conversion adapter.. It is compatible with DSDS (Dual SIM Dual Stand-by), so you can use two nano SIM cards at the same time. It will be an exclusive use with the microSD card slot, but depending on the storage capacity, it has 64GB model and 128GB model, so if you are using DSDS, it is safe to go for 128GB.. It has leather-like finish at the back excepet where the camera is, so unlike metal or glass, it doesn't get fingerprints at all.. There is a slight camera bump, but the surrounding of the lenses has a bump too, so it doesn't get unstable when you place it on a desk.. It is great that it comes with a VR headset to build on your own, a Hi-Res supported ZenEar and a clear case.. The AR apps you can enjoy with the ZenFone AR gives you a totally different experience from existing AR apps. With its three cameras, it can scan the area to make 3D models, it can show you a real-sized car that you can actually open its doors, and you can project the virtual images of furniture and home appliances you choose from catalogues. It is a totally new experience.. There are not many Tango supported apps, and there are no apps that can be called a killer app at this stage. However, when there are more Tango enabled smartphones like the ZenFone AR in the market, the number of apps would increase too. It is like when smartwatches came to the market; it seems there are big business chances for app developers.. Trying over 20 apps that support Tango, the most interesting one was an app called Scenes. It captures area in 3D, and you can get measurements from the 3D model. It is fun just to look at a same old meeting room in 3D.. This is an official app from BMW, the BMW i Visualiser. Using the motion tracking camera, it can show a life-sized virtual i3 and i8. You can have a close look at it by physically going close to the virtual model. You can also tap doors and the boot to open and close, turn the engine on, and change the colors of the inside and outside.. I know it is AR, but it is exciting to be getting in to the driver's seat.. iStage is an app that enables users to place virtual furniture and home appliances in real time. You can buy furniture and home appliances you like from the app too. It doesn't have many products, but it is practical that you can place life-sized furniture to simulate.. In the scanned area, you can fight zombies with Crayola Color Blaster. You can use your smartphone as a gun and shoot zombies that attack you from 360degrees. It is fun in a different way from ordinary shooting games that you walk around holding up your smartphone looking around.. You can have your own AR pet with Raise. It has a saving feature, so you can feed your pet and play with a ball anytime anywhere. When you throw a ball, it runs and fetches it. I cannot help imagining to have my favorite anime or game characters instead of pets.. I checked the phone's temperature while using AR using FLIR ONE, a thermal imaging camera. Possibly because it becomes a burden on CPU when the three cameras are used fully, the surroundings of the rear camera heats up and it uses the battery a lot quicker than usual. It is difficult to tell from the image, but the sides got hot, too. However, exhaust heat is controlled by software, and it never froze even when the phone got hot. It uses 50% in an hour when AR apps are used.. There are more apps other than the ones I mentioned above; some are practical, and with some, I am not even sure what they are for. I feel they are amazing, but at the same time, I wish there were more apps with higher completion level. Apps that scan the area, or place furniture, or measure distance, can be killer apps if the accuracy improves, so I would like to hope their improvement.. As for games, there were no games that made me feel like playing for a long time. All of them were fun at first as they are different, but I got tired of them soon, to be honest. The key from now will be how to work AR and games together.. Daydream View, a VR headset and controller by Google.. Lastly, I would like to mention about the basic specification of the ZenFone AR. Its CPU is Qualcomm Snapdragon 821. As for storage, you can choose either 64GB or 128GB. Surprisingly, with 128GB, it has the world's first 8GB big capacity RAM. I cannot deny it is too much for a smartphone, but it is good news for heavy users who do multitasking or play games.. The ZenFone AR has a camera with both optical and electronic image stabilization and high-speed 0.03-second autofocus, and fingerprint sensor and is Hi-Res audio compatible; it has amazing functions like an high-end smartphone other than the AR and VR.. Concerns would be the battery capacity and heating issues, but it didn't feel like a big problem when the AR is not used. It is clear that the AR and VR are this phone's big characteristics, but this is a high-performance smartphone you can use for a long time even without these functions..

Asus Zenfone AR ZS571KL - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 … 15 16 ». If this has a battery of 6000 mAh, I'm dying right now.. davidtb823, 11 Dec 2017 One gets the impression the 8/128 is a myth. Dropped it quite a few times already (in an incipio case), not a scratch. In fact I've almost no complaints about it, just the battery life could be better, especially when you use Tango.. One gets the impression the 8/128 is a myth. One gets the impression the 8/128 is a myth. This phone cannot receive a single knock. Its glass cracks at the slightest knock. Unless Samsung that can withstand hard knocks, this phone is so fragile that u have to basically best put it on a floor to use. Hear my view: AVOID this phone. Its not worth the pain of quarreling with the Service Center which they will tell you your cracks are not under warranty and so we have to charge you a fee. Anonymous, 16 Nov 2017 Does it have a LED notification light? FM Radio? VoLTE? Yes,it has Notification LED,VoLTE and FM radio..

We need your opinion...pls I've had this phone since August with Verizon and its awesome. No complaints, super fast/smooth, great display, strong battery life. I also have a IP 7 Plus, G6 and a One Plus 3t.. Vonarian, 11 Aug 2017 SD835 wasn't released.. NO,higher battery capacity will make this phone Unslim.9mm is good.. extended battery life and waterproofing are the important things, and having a thin phone doesn't mean squat when you stick it in a thick protective case anyway.. Dmk, 28 Sep 2017 You need to plug something into the radio jack for the radio to work. more BT headphones are for hipsters. This and lenovo phab2 pro support Tango. this phone is only that support google AR (tango) and google VR (daydream) which are there in flagship such as PiXel. Hyacin, 14 Sep 2017 The specs here claim FM Radio - and I think I found *one* Asus site that says the same - Phili... more I've found in the past with ASUS that the FM radio is restricted to only certain countries. Depending on the firmware it's running, it may be blocked unless you can install possibly the European version which I've found in the past to unlock the FM radio ability on my old padfone X. I always find it strange when hardware is installed only to be disabled for no apparent reason, what a waste of technology.. Hyacin, 14 Sep 2017 The specs here claim FM Radio - and I think I found *one* Asus site that says the same - Phili... more You need to plug something into the radio jack for the radio to work. Basically you still need an antenna such as headphones. Problem is that most people use Bluetooth.. The specs here claim FM Radio - and I think I found *one* Asus site that says the same - Philippines I think, but no other Asus sites seem to claim it. I've tried a number of FM Radio apps and all of them claim the FM Radio is not enabled ... the Asus app for previous Zenfone versions does not work on the AR. Has anyone got FM Radio working?.

I own two of these phones personally. you can get much closer small objects and focus quickly. speed is beyond any iphone, or crapware android IE: LG, samsung, google, ect. screen is awesome, and comes with a blue filter "night mode" to keep your eyes from killing you at night. everyone wants to know about battery life im sure, its a 3300mah. if you run it hard, like any phone itll die quickly. it supports speed chargers, and typical usb c lower amp ones. id suggest a decent speed charger from verizon, and get a braided cable from cable creation on amazon due to its stock cable being SHORT and thin. but for 8$ you can get two very nice ones off amazon. not a fan of the stock keyboard. they are similar, but google is better arranged imo..

The ASUS ZenFone AR ( ZS571KL ) is the first phone to support both Tango and Daydream. Tango is a set of sensors and computer vision software that will allow you to experience augmented reality right from the ZenFone AR. These three core technologies are motion tracking, depth perception, and area learning.. Meanwhile, Daydream is Google’s platform for high-quality, mobile virtual reality. With the ZenFone AR and Daydream View headset, you will be able to dive into into incredible VR adventures. Inside the ZenFone AR, top-of-the-line components work together to power these 3D worlds for you to explore. A rich 2K Super AMOLED screen displays these next-generation apps in crystal clarity and vibrancy. Let’s take a closer look at everything the ZenFone AR has to offer.. Tango is a set of sensors and computer vision software that enables augmented reality experiences on your phone. The ZenFone AR uses three cameras (called the TriCam system) to provide Tango’s motion tracking, depth perception, and area learning abilities.. ZenFone AR is equipped with the innovative TriCam system consisting of three rear cameras — a motion tracking, depth sensing, and high-resolution 23MP camera — that enable the phone to a create a three-dimensional model of its surroundings and track its motion, so it can see the world just like you do. The motion tracking camera lets ZenFone AR track its location as it moves through space. The depth sensing camera with an infrared (IR) projector lets ZenFone AR measure its distance from real-world objects. The high-resolution 23MP camera lets you view virtual objects in your actual environment in stunning detail. Together with Tango, ZenFone AR delivers engaging augmented reality experiences for you to explore and enjoy.. The first camera is a motion tracking sensor. This helps the ZenFone AR understand its motion in space. A dedicated inertial measuring unit can tell which direction you’re moving in and how quickly you’re going there.. The second is a depth-sensing camera that fires an array of infrared lasers in front of the user so the ZenFone AR can understand its distance to objects in the real world. This is done simply by measuring the amount of time it takes for those beams to bounce back from the surface. These lasers need to fire continuously to keep an up-to-date model of surroundings.. The last is a 23 megapixel Sony IMX318 camera, this ensures a faithful reproduction of the real world, for example, as a backdrop to your augmented reality experiences. The ASUS TriTech system helps this camera get a lock on subjects quickly, thanks to infrared lasers, phase detection, and continuous autofocus.. Daydream is a platform for high quality, mobile VR by Google. It consists of Daydream-ready phones, Daydream-ready headsets and controllers, and apps built for VR. Daydream View is the first Daydream-ready headset and controller made by Google, and it works with the ZenFone AR to bring you incredible VR experiences.. An important part of Daydream View is the Daydream controller, which lets you interact with the virtual world. It points where you point, and has smart software and sensors built in so you can swing it like a bat, wave it like a wand, or navigate a maze. With the ZenFone AR and Daydream View, you will be able to explore new worlds through Google Street View and Fantastic Beasts. Kick back in your personal cinema with YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, and HBO. Get in the game with Gunjack 2, LEGO ® BrickHeadz, and Need for Speed. That’s just the beginning of the VR possibilities with the ZenFone AR and Daydream.. The ZenFone AR has the processing power to handle the latest and greatest virtual reality titles. The core of the ZenFone AR is the world’s first. Qualcomm ® Snapdragon ™ 821 processor. Alongside the Adreno 530 graphics processor, the 821 has been tailor-built for Tango and augmented reality. This is absolutely vital to maintain smooth performance under intense usage.. Up to 8 GB of RAM (a world first for a smartphone) and 256 GB of UFS 2.0 storage keep the bar high. Large capacity and high speed are needed to ensure 3D models can be created, stored, and recalled quickly; when you’re enjoying augmented reality, these assets are a core part of the experience. Rest assured that your time in VR and AR will be smooth and flawless.. The screen is your window to these new digital frontiers. To do them justice, ASUS has included a gorgeous 5.7-inch 2K display. It’s a Super AMOLED screen, which means great battery efficiency and stunning colors. The ZenFone AR is able to create clear and vibrant imagery thanks in no small part to color reproduction rated at over 100% NTSC and the 2560 x 1440 resolution. To top it all off, a Gorilla Glass 4 screen provides proven protection against day-to-day bumps and scratches.. The ZenFone AR is an incredible device that opens up new worlds through both augmented reality and virtual reality. Its core processing is powerful enough to take on these demanding Tango and Daydream applications and deliver experiences like no other. Would you like to know more?

What is the ability of the world's first smartphone, the ZenFone AR, with 8GB RAM like?. It has three cameras but remains to be the same size as the iPhone 7 Plus!. You can experience things you have never experienced with the Tango AR!. The ZenFone AR is a high performance smartphone even without AR.. The ZenFone AR, a SIM free smartphone from ASUS, is the world's first smartphone that supports both Google AR platform "Tango" and VR platform "Daydream.". Also, this is the world's first smartphone with 8GB RAM. (Note that the 64GB model has 6GB RAM.) Considering that even the iPhone 7 Plus has only 3GB RAM, you can see how high performance 8GB RAM means. We tried this smartphone with two of the "world's first" elements to see its ability.. What is the ability of the world's first Tango enabled and Daydream-ready smartphone, the ZenFone AR like?. The Google Tango is an AR computing platform that enables users to use motion tracking, depth perception, and area learning on mobile devices with Android. AR came to be known widely with the Pokémon GO which shows Pokémon as if they were in real life, but apps compatible with the Tango enables users to experience AR in a far higher level than the Pokémon GO. However, to work apps that support Tango on mobile devices, they require three cameras; a main camera with high resolution, a depth sensing camera and a motion tracking camera. At the moment only the ZenFone AR and the PHAB2 Pro from Lenovo have them.. ZenFone AR is equipped with a TriCam system consisting of three cameras; 23MP camera on its back (left top), motion tracking camera (left bottom) and depth sensing camera (right top).. The PHAB2 Pro, the world's first Tango enabled smartphone released before this, has AR but it was big in size. It gained good reputation from app developers, but it was difficult to say even as a compliment that it was suitable for daily use for average users. On the other hand, the ZenFone AR does not only support Tango but also VR platform Daydream, and yet it only has the size of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, which means it is compact enough for users to use it with one hand. As for its look, it has leather like finish except for where the rear camera is, and it achieves high designability.. The ZenFone AR is 158.98 x 77.7 x 4.6 - 8.95 (HWD mm) and it weighs about 170g. Its 5.7-inch Super AMOLED display with 2560 x 1440 resolution achieves high contrast bright colors.. The home button with a finger print sensor located at the front bottom is a physical button.. The charging terminal is the latest USB-Type C. Also, it has an audio jack on its bottom and it is compatible with Hi-Res audio. Unlike the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, you can listen to music using an earphone while charging without a conversion adapter.. It is compatible with DSDS (Dual SIM Dual Stand-by), so you can use two nano SIM cards at the same time. It will be an exclusive use with the microSD card slot, but depending on the storage capacity, it has 64GB model and 128GB model, so if you are using DSDS, it is safe to go for 128GB.. It has leather-like finish at the back excepet where the camera is, so unlike metal or glass, it doesn't get fingerprints at all.. There is a slight camera bump, but the surrounding of the lenses has a bump too, so it doesn't get unstable when you place it on a desk.. It is great that it comes with a VR headset to build on your own, a Hi-Res supported ZenEar and a clear case.. The AR apps you can enjoy with the ZenFone AR gives you a totally different experience from existing AR apps. With its three cameras, it can scan the area to make 3D models, it can show you a real-sized car that you can actually open its doors, and you can project the virtual images of furniture and home appliances you choose from catalogues. It is a totally new experience.. There are not many Tango supported apps, and there are no apps that can be called a killer app at this stage. However, when there are more Tango enabled smartphones like the ZenFone AR in the market, the number of apps would increase too. It is like when smartwatches came to the market; it seems there are big business chances for app developers.. Trying over 20 apps that support Tango, the most interesting one was an app called Scenes. It captures area in 3D, and you can get measurements from the 3D model. It is fun just to look at a same old meeting room in 3D.. This is an official app from BMW, the BMW i Visualiser. Using the motion tracking camera, it can show a life-sized virtual i3 and i8. You can have a close look at it by physically going close to the virtual model. You can also tap doors and the boot to open and close, turn the engine on, and change the colors of the inside and outside.. I know it is AR, but it is exciting to be getting in to the driver's seat.. iStage is an app that enables users to place virtual furniture and home appliances in real time. You can buy furniture and home appliances you like from the app too. It doesn't have many products, but it is practical that you can place life-sized furniture to simulate.. In the scanned area, you can fight zombies with Crayola Color Blaster. You can use your smartphone as a gun and shoot zombies that attack you from 360degrees. It is fun in a different way from ordinary shooting games that you walk around holding up your smartphone looking around.. You can have your own AR pet with Raise. It has a saving feature, so you can feed your pet and play with a ball anytime anywhere. When you throw a ball, it runs and fetches it. I cannot help imagining to have my favorite anime or game characters instead of pets.. I checked the phone's temperature while using AR using FLIR ONE, a thermal imaging camera. Possibly because it becomes a burden on CPU when the three cameras are used fully, the surroundings of the rear camera heats up and it uses the battery a lot quicker than usual. It is difficult to tell from the image, but the sides got hot, too. However, exhaust heat is controlled by software, and it never froze even when the phone got hot. It uses 50% in an hour when AR apps are used.. There are more apps other than the ones I mentioned above; some are practical, and with some, I am not even sure what they are for. I feel they are amazing, but at the same time, I wish there were more apps with higher completion level. Apps that scan the area, or place furniture, or measure distance, can be killer apps if the accuracy improves, so I would like to hope their improvement.. As for games, there were no games that made me feel like playing for a long time. All of them were fun at first as they are different, but I got tired of them soon, to be honest. The key from now will be how to work AR and games together.. Daydream View, a VR headset and controller by Google.. Lastly, I would like to mention about the basic specification of the ZenFone AR. Its CPU is Qualcomm Snapdragon 821. As for storage, you can choose either 64GB or 128GB. Surprisingly, with 128GB, it has the world's first 8GB big capacity RAM. I cannot deny it is too much for a smartphone, but it is good news for heavy users who do multitasking or play games.. The ZenFone AR has a camera with both optical and electronic image stabilization and high-speed 0.03-second autofocus, and fingerprint sensor and is Hi-Res audio compatible; it has amazing functions like an high-end smartphone other than the AR and VR.. Concerns would be the battery capacity and heating issues, but it didn't feel like a big problem when the AR is not used. It is clear that the AR and VR are this phone's big characteristics, but this is a high-performance smartphone you can use for a long time even without these functions..

ASUS ZenFone AR Price, Review and Specifications. Asus Zenfone AR was unveiled along with the company's ZenFone 3 Zoom at the CES, 2017. The Zenphone is the world's first ever smartphone to support both the Google Tango AR platform as well the Google Daydream VR platform. On the outside, the Zenfone AR looks like a customary phone save for the high-tech AR camera module on the rear. It 's quite a handful but still manageable. The weight is well balanced too. The plastic on the rear robs it of a premium flagship finish, though. The phone has a Snapdragon 821 SoC which is supported by an Adreno 520 GPU and is run by 6/8 Gigs of RAM. Having a screen size of 5.7-inch, the ZenFone AR is available in 32GB, 64GB, 128GB and 256GB storage space options. It has a 3,300mAh battery which is supported by a Quick Charge 3.0 fast charging support. Running on the latest Android 7.0 Nougat, it has a mammoth 23MP rear camera with 3x optical zoom along with two separate depth and motion tracking sensors. Further, the ZenFone AR has an 8MP front camera with an 85-degree wide-angle lens. The Zenfone AR India Price is 49,999 INR at the time of writing, which makes it a tad expensive. The AR and VR features of the phone work fine and should appeal to early adopters, but AR still isn't mainstream and thus it's not a priority for most people.. High-quality Camera Latest Android High-Resolution Display Supports AR and Daydream VR. Hybrid dual SIM Doesn't feel premium. Asus is one of few manufacturers which had more serious smartphone announcements at CES 2017. The most important thing you must know is the device is equipped with Tango, the Augmented Reality platform that adds an information layer on top of the physical surroundings in 3D using a set of cameras on the back. Asus takes the technology a step further with support of Daydream, Google's Virtual Reality, which is built into Android Nougat.. Project Tango Augmented Reality Daydream Virtual Reality Android 7.0 Nougat OS. ASUS's ZenFone AR is the second Tango phone on the market, and it's a big improvement for people itching to try augmented reality. It's markedly more powerful than last year's LenovoPhab2 Pro, it brings a much better camera, and is compact enough toactually fit in your pocket. Unfortunately, the ZenFone's weak battery and heavily skinned interface mean it's a tough sell for people who aren't already sold on Google's vision of the future.. Support for both Daydream VR and Google Tango Great display Impressive audio quality Surprisingly good camera Solid performance, even with Tango apps. ASUS's ZenUI feels like overkill Disappointing battery life Many Tango experiences miss the mark Not compelling if you're not interested in Tango. The Asus Zenfone AR is a great demo for augmented reality and Daydream virtual reality, even if it shows AR is begging for more great apps. However, it’s a tough sell when the phone costs as much as a Galaxy S8 Plus but has a less striking design, no water resistance and less power. The Asus Zenfone AR is the first phone to be certified for both Google Tango and Daydream. The Asus Zenfone AR has what it takes for good phone VR thanks to its high-resolution OLED screen.. Great screen Good camera Great demo for mobile AR/VR. Relatively plain design Very expensive Second-tier CPU. If you’re an Asus fan, we suggest waiting for the ZenFone 4 Pro to see if the problems found here are remedied in the company’s true flagship device. If AR is super important to you, then you can buy the ZenFone AR and know that you’ll have a decently performing phone with dreadful battery life, heating issues, and an inconsistent camera behind its marquee feature.. Quick performance ZenUI affords a lot of customization Only phone with both Tango (AR) and Daydream (VR). Heats up very easily Battery life is awful Camera is very inconsistent with color capture Confusing menu layouts, with no useful search option Price pits it against some of the best in smartphones today.

Last revision on February 6, 2018. Runs Tango AR and Daydream VR apps. Design is kind of meh, with big bezels and an old-school home button. Asus's ZenFone AR combines Augmented with Virtual Reality: it is, after all, the first smartphone ever certified for Google Tango as well as Daydream. The most interesting question is whether or not its AR- and VR-features justify its.... If you're an Asus fan, we suggest waiting for the ZenFone 4 Pro to see if the problems found here are remedied in the company's true flagship device. If AR is super important to you, then you can buy the ZenFone AR and know that you'll have a decently.... Owners of the ASUS ZenFone AR may be tempted to ask their friends and co-workers, "Do you even AR, bro?". Asking that question is a surefire way to solicit puzzled (and perhaps annoyed) looks, but once they see what the ZenFone AR is capable of, those.... If you're looking for a smartphone with average looks and somewhat above average performance, the Asus Zenfone AR fits that bill. The design is rather plebeian, but the screen, battery life, voice, and data performance all exceeded my expectations. It's no doubt that the ASUS ZenFone AR is an ambitious smartphone – and the one that gels with the Taiwanese brand's philosophy quite well – offering innovative and industry-leading features such as support for both Augmented and Virtual Reality, and.... There are several versions of the ASUS ZenFone AR out on the market today. One has 6GB Ram and 64GB internal storage that costs $600. That version has GSM connectivity and is available through Amazon. Another version also works with GSM SIM.... Eight months ago, a phone called the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro arrived and brought with it a not-yet-fully-realized promise of advanced AR. It was a giant slab of a smartphone, built to Google's specifications for its Tango AR product, and it didn't make a.... Lenovo's Phab2 Pro might have been first, but the ZenFone AR's superior hardware makes it the best Tango device yet. That's not really saying much, though: The Tango experience isn't much better than it was a year ago, and there still isn't much there.... The Asus ZenFone AR gives us a tantalizing peek at the future of smartphones. For $599, you get a smartphone powerful enough to support some of Google's most innovative software. There's also the slick customizable user interface and the excellent.... The Asus Zenfone AR is a pocketable phone capable of handling Google Tango and Daydream, but beyond that it's not worth its price tag.. The ZenFone AR is one of the most expensive smartphones to hit the UK in 2017, although also one of the more unique handsets we've had the pleasure of reviewing.In terms of performance, camera tech, battery life and media chops, you'll find rival.... Every time a new platform comes out, the gadget world runs headfirst into a vicious Catch-22: How do you get people to adopt new technology when there isnt any content, and if there isnt anyone using the tech, how do you convince developers to make.... It's not often you see a phone pack in multiple experimental Google features, but ASUS has done it with the ASUS ZenFone AR. The company's latest flagship phone is built for Google Tango, a once experimental augmented reality (AR) system that has now.... So where does this leave us? The ZenFone AR isn't a bad phone, but it isn't a great one, either. In the end, I don't that it's worth buying currently. Tango is cool and all, but you'll likely play with it a few times and never open it (or the apps).... Terms of Use Privacy Policy Advertise Powered by.
