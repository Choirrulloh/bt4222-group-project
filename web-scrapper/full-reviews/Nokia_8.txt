Phone Arena — Nokia 8 goes through harsh durability test, will this Android flagship survive?. Not to be confused with Nokia N8 .. 8 Sirocco: 7003326000000000000♠ 3260. Nokia 8 is a high-end Nokia -branded smartphone running Android Nougat. [2] Announced on 16 August 2017 in London, England, it was developed in Espoo , Finland , by HMD Global. [3] [4] The phone began sales in Europe in September 2017. Nokia 8 is the first high-end Nokia-branded device since Nokia Lumia 930 in 2014. An improved version, the Nokia 8 Sirocco , was announced on 25 February 2018 at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. 1.2.1 Cameras and multimedia. The Nokia 8 has a 5.3" display and averages 7.3. It is available in four colors: Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue and Steel. [6] The device features a full-length graphite-shielded copper cooling pipe that is designed to pull the heat away from the Snapdragon 835 chip and dissipate it across the full length and breadth of the smartphone. [7] The phone is not water-resistant, but is IP54 splash-resistant. Nokia 8 comes with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 CPU, backed by either 4 or 6 GB of RAM and 64. GB of internal storage (Tempered Blue, Steel and Polished Copper-coloured models), or 6. GB of internal storage (Polished Blue). Both are expandable with microSD cards. The QHD display is protected by Gorilla Glass 5. The device includes the USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 port for charging and data transfer (up to 5 Gbit/s). Nokia 8 is the first Nokia-branded phone to feature a dual-lens camera system. The rear camera module includes a set of two 13 MP sensors, of which one is an RGB sensor, and the other a monochrome sensor. The rear camera is equipped with optical image stabilization (OIS), f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, an IR rangefinder, and a dual-LED flash. The front and rear cameras' combined standout feature is an advanced dualphotographic image camera (rebranded "Bothie" by Nokia), where the cameras can be used simultaneously by dividing the screen into a split-image setup, a technology Nokia calls Dual-Sight mode. [10] Both the front and main cameras use ZEISS optics. Video recording can be done in resolutions of 2160p at 30fps (4K) and 1080p at 30fps (FHD), with single-touch live streaming to social networks. [12] The cellphone contains several microphones able to record spatial audio 360° with binaural audio codecs, providing high fidelity playback through OZO Audio technology, which was derived from the Nokia OZO camera. The phone is equipped with a single rear mounted loudspeaker, so is not fully Dolby Atmos compatible. It is equipped with a 3.5. These audio outputs use the OZO spatial audio playback to produce high quality 360° surround sound from two speakers(or ear buds) and use decoding standards compatible with Dolby Atmos and other earlier surround sound standards. Like the Nokia 3 , Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 , it ran a near-stock version of Android 7.1.1 "Nougat" on release. [15] One difference is the camera mobile app, so as to cater for the phone's Dual-Sight feature. It also comes with an always-on display, similar to Nokia's previous Glance Screen on the Nokia Lumia series. On 24 November 2017, HMD started rolling out a partial (it will not include the Treble feature for device independent system updates) [1] software upgrade to Android 8.0 Oreo. The main rollout was phased over two days, however some network operators will release the software upgrade in the following weeks. ^ a b Nokia 8 won’t get Android 8.0 Treble feature, HMD says why. ^ "Nokia 8 specifications". ^ "Nokia 8 appears on official website". ^ "Nokia 8 website leak". ^ "The Nokia 8 Sirocco is a curved glass Android flagship with no headphone jack". ^ "Nokia 8: It has 5 cool features but it's also missing 5 key things". ^ "Nokia 8: Just a flagship phone that bypasses substance for gimmicks?". ^ "Nokia 8 specs - a full flagship in every way that matters". ^ "Nokia 8 price, specifications, features".

Nokia 8 Review: The Comeback Kid Falls Slightly Short. Smartphone enthusiasts were excited with the news of Nokia’s comeback to the smartphone scene, especially those who were fans of the Finnish company’s mobile phones in the late 90s and early 2000s. The fact that Nokia finally started making Android smartphones gave consumers immense hope of stable future. Deep down, we all wanted to see a combination of Nokia’s excellent design, camera, and reliability with the modern-ness of Android software, especially after the disaster that was Windows Phone.. The Finnish company took some extra care to made sure that it didn’t repeat mistakes this time. First, it released Nokia 6, a mid-range phone. It then released a few more entry-level and mid-range devices before releasing its first high-end Android smartphone. The Nokia 8 has all the bells and whistles that are expected from a modern Android smartphone, including the 2017’s best Snapdragon processor, a dual-camera setup, dust and splash resistance, latest wired and wireless connectivity features, a rapidly charging battery, and the latest version of Android operating system. All of this, priced at a very sensible Rs. Nokia is not competing against the Apples and Samsungs of this world right now. It picked its fight really well, going against the affordable flagships like the OnePlus 5T and the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2. But how does the phone perform? Let’s find out in our Nokia 8 review.. In its hay days, Nokia had experimented a lot with mobile phone designs, right from the Communicator series to the L’Amour series and everything in between. However, Nokia didn’t go too crazy with its first high-end Android smartphone. It went with a design theme that’s common among smartphones these days. The frame of the Nokia 8 is made out of a single block of Series 6000 Aluminium, and the front is covered mostly by the screen, protected by Gorilla Glass 5. The phone doesn’t feature a bezel-less screen, so there’s enough room for a front-facing fingerprint reader. The volume and power buttons on right side of the phone are made out of metal, but they are a bit harder to press if you’re holding the phone from its front. The headphone jack is at the top. The USB Type-C port is at the bottom along with the loudspeaker and the primary microphone. Nano SIM card and microSD card can be inserted into a hybrid slot that’s on the left side of the phone. If you want to use a secondary SIM, you’ll have to let go of storage expansion.. The Nokia 8’s wireless reception antennae are situated at the top and bottom of the device, making it almost impossible for a user to block the signals. The rear-facing dual-camera setup is placed vertically along with an LED flash, laser autofocus, secondary microphone, and ZEISS branding. The rear of the phone, which also has the classic Nokia logo, comes in two finishes: matte and polished. The particular model we reviewed had a polished and shiny blue back. Nokia says that it can take over 20 hours to of polishing to make those backs look so shiny. The back of our unit picked up scratches just after one month of use without a cover, which is also true for most high-end phones these days. Of all the Nokia 8 colour variants available in India, we think that the *Polished Copper* and *Steel* variants look the most interesting. The phone is IP54 certified for dust and splash resistance, but we wish it had a higher ingress protection rating for proper water resistance.. The phone is quite ergonomic, handy and strong.. The phone is quite handy and ergonomic, thanks to its relatively smaller screen size and sides that curve towards the rear of the phone. Although the Series 6000 Aluminium is considered to be relatively weaker than Series 7000 Aluminium, we do not have any concerns about the Nokia 8’s durability, mostly due to how well-designed the internal structure is compared to a weaker structure of the iPhone 6 Plus. The iPhone 6 Plus’s body was made using Series 6000 Aluminium and had a weaker internal structure, making it susceptible to bending. The Nokia 8 has proved once again that the Finnish brand knows how to make strong phones.. Unlike most flagship smartphones released this year, the Nokia 8 has a relatively smaller display at 5.3 inches, but relatively sharp nonetheless (2560x1440 pixels). No matter the task at hand, you can always be assured of sharp visuals. The IPS LCD screen is very bright and the contents on the display are easily visible even under bright sunlight. It is easily one of the brightest LCD screen I’ve ever used on a smartphone. Contrast ratio is excellent as well. The only problem is the display’s extremely cold colour temperature. Whites appear bluer, which might put off some users. If Nokia had offered an option to tweak the screen’s colour temperature, it would have been great. Except the colour temperature of the Nokia 8’s screen, everything else about the screen is excellent (as good as it LCD screens can get). We would’ve liked an OLED screen, though, even if it was a Full HD (1920x1080 pixels) panel.. The IPS LCD screen is very bright and the contents on the display are easily visible even under bright sunlight.. Coming to the audio experience on the Nokia 8, the single, bottom-facing loudspeaker is decently loud, but lacks the oomph of stereo speakers used in some other phones such as the iPhones 8, HTC U11, or the Pixel 2. The phone features a 3.5mm headphone port, something that has been slowly disappearing from high-end smartphones. If you still want to go the wireless way for earphones, you’ll be glad to know that the Nokia 8 has Bluetooth 5.0 and advanced codecs such as aptX and aptX HD, which collectively offer improved range, data transfer rate, and higher audio fidelity. Sadly, we couldn’t test any Bluetooth 5.0 wireless headphones with the Nokia 8 because there isn’t a single Bluetooth 5.0 headphone available for purchase in India (at the time of publishing this review). The phone works well with Wi-Fi based audio transmission technologies such as Google Cast.. Back in the early 2000s, Nokia used to make excellent smartphone cameras. We still remember the Finnish brand’s legendary camera phones such as the N73, N95, N8, Lumia 1020, and the Lumia 1520. When we came to know that Nokia is planning to re-enter the smartphone market, we were excited to see what it could bring to the table with its smartphone cameras. With the likes of Apple, Google, and Samsung consistently making strides in improving smartphone camera quality, helped by powerful algorithms and software fine tuning. Nokia could no longer just rely on larger sensors to match its competitors. Just before launching the Nokia 8, the company announced a partnership with Carl ZEISS to equip its high-end smartphones with quality optics.. The front-facing camera can even record 4K videos, making the Nokia 8 the first phone to achieve this feat.. There are two 13MP camera sensors on the Nokia 8, with one of primary camera being an RGB sensor with OIS, f/2.0 aperture, and 1.12µm pixel size. There’s phase-detection, laser autofocus, and dual-tone dual-LED flash. It can record 4K videos, too. The secondary sensor is a monochrome one, which is used to achieve better sharpness and dynamic range. The front-facing 13MP camera features phase-detection autofocus, f/2.0 aperture, and 1.12µm pixel size. The front-facing camera can even record 4K videos, making the Nokia 8 the first phone to achieve this feat. Thanks to dual-microphones and Nokia OZO audio, the Nokia 8 can capture high-definition audio while recording videos. Nokia is also promoting ‘Bothie’, which can be used to simultaneously capture images and videos from the front as well as rear cameras, both stitched side-by-side into a single frame. Bothie videos can even be live-streamed on Facebook and YouTube.. Frankly, we were quite disappointed by the Nokia 8’s rear-facing dual-camera.. So, how’s the Nokia 8’s image and video quality? Frankly, we were quite disappointed by the Nokia 8’s rear-facing dual-camera. Images shot in daylight conditions had decent colours, but the details were not as good as found in images from other phones. Dynamic range was limited in spite of help from the monochrome camera sensor, which is theoretically supposed to help in achieving better dynamic range and sharpness. In low-light conditions, the image quality suffers considerably. Noise increases dramatically and colours appear extremely washed out. We expected the phone to have a much better image quality in low-light conditions, especially since it has OIS. The OnePlus 5T performs much better even though it lacks OIS, probably due to a better lens, wider aperture, and relatively mature image processing. On the other hand, the Nokia 8’s front-facing camera is one of the best selfie cameras out there, thanks to a phase-detection autofocus and larger pixels.. 4K videos captured using the Nokia 8 are good but not great. They suffer from the same issues that were visible in stills: softer details and muted colours. The audio quality is great, though. Thanks to Nokia OZO audio, videos have high-quality audio, and you can choose to focus on sound coming from the front, rear, or surround. Thanks to OIS, videos look smooth, but details could’ve been better and colours could’ve been more livelier. Full HD videos have more details in them, which is surprising since most phones capture more details with their highest video recording resolution settings. As I mentioned earlier, even the front-facing cameras can record 4K videos, which is a first among all the smartphones.. The Nokia 8 was launched with Android 7.1 Nougat. During our two-month review period, HMD Global rolled out the Android 8.0 Oreo update to the smartphone. The phone received the latest Android security patches every month. Kudos to HMD Global for that! I haven’t experienced such faster Android software updates on phones except on Google’s own Nexus and Pixel lineup. The whole user interface follows Google’s design guidelines, and the software is extremely clean, to the extent of being boring. The only app on the Nokia 8 that’s custom made is the camera app. Even the app launcher used on the Nokia 8 is quite similar to what’s used on Pixel smartphones.. The phone received the latest Android security patches every month. Kudos to HMD Global for that!. The UI is fluid and smooth, except in the camera app where the phone struggles a lot. I faced stutters and lag while clicking images and videos during the review period. The camera app can be launched by double clicking the power button. There’s Glance Mode that shows important information such as time, date, day, battery charge level, and notifications when it detects motion or when the notifications arrive. This feature is also present on many Android phones. However, the Nokia 8 and the LG G6 are the only phones that has this feature in spite of using LCD screen panels, so they can’t be as versatile or power efficient as Samsung, OnePlus, and Pixel phones while using the Always On Display feature.. The Nokia 8 uses 2017’s top-of-the-line processor from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835. The processor is paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. Storage space can be expanded using a microSD card (the phone supports up to 256GB cards). Performance was on par, similar to most other Snapdragon 835-equipped phones, but I’ve seen better. The Pixel 2 and the OnePlus 5T appear faster than the Nokia 8, and the UI appears slightly smoother as well. The performance improved a bit after the Oreo update. The only place where the Nokia 8 struggled was while using its camera. Wireless reception was stellar, and I didn’t face any problem related to GPS, something that I had faced a lot while using the Google Pixel 2 XL. The dual-SIM connection worked well to. I used a Reliance JIO SIM in the first SIM card slot and an Airtel SIM in the second SIM card slot while reviewing the Nokia 8.. The Nokia 8 comes with a 3090mAh battery, which can be rapidly charged using a Quick Charge 3.0 compatible wall adapter (or a power bank). The Nokia 8’s battery can be topped up to 50% in just 30 minutes using the supplied 18W Quick Charge 3.0 wall charger. I am generally a pretty heavy smartphone user, and my usage includes three email accounts, half a dozen of social media and IM apps each, four music streaming apps, and four video streaming apps. I usually charge the phones fully in the morning and then leave for work. I constantly keep a tab on Twitter, use the email app throughout the day, and Slack for team chats.. The Nokia 8 lasts around 18-20 hours with a screen-on time of around four to five hours, which isn't chart-topping.. With my kind of usage, the Nokia 8 lasted till 10PM with a screen-on time of around four to five hours. These figures are decent, but not chart topping. The OnePlus 5T, which falls into the same price range, lasts longer and offers a screen-on time of around five to six hours. Frankly, we expected a bit more from Nokia’s first high-end Android smartphone. We also looked out if the battery life improved post the Android 8.0 update, but it remained the same. In case you find yourself in a situation where the Nokia 8 has low battery level and there’s time before you can reach home, you can turn on the battery saver feature.. We begun reviewing the Nokia 8 with pretty high hopes, especially due to its impressive specifications and relatively affordable price tag, and the Nokia 8 mostly delivered. It’s a very well-built device, and the only Snapdragon 835 equipped phone in its price segment to offer some kind of protection against dust and water splashes. It has a bright and sharp screen but it would’ve been great if it was calibrated better. The Nokia 8 has a fast, bloatware-free software based on Android 8.0 Oreo. The company has even promised operating system updates and monthly security patches for two years. Its battery charges fast and lasts a whole day.. If Nokia wants any place in the today’s breakneck-paced smartphone market, it needs to step up its camera game.. The only area where the Nokia 8 ended up disappointing us is the camera quality. In spite of two camera sensors, OIS, and f/2.0 aperture, the pictures had below par image quality, with slightly washed out colours and less details compared to other phones in its price segment. In low-light conditions, results were even worse, with completely washed out colours, lots of noise, and ruined details. Going by Nokia’s history, we expected the Nokia 8’s camera to be neck-to-neck in performance, if not better, compared to cameras on other phones like the OnePlus 5T and the LG G6, but it isn’t.. If Nokia wants any place in the today’s breakneck-paced smartphone market, it needs to step up its camera game. The Finnish company also needs to implement an 18:9 bezel-less screen in its next high-end smartphone to keep up with the modern times. We want Nokia to succeed, and it has done much better than the likes of Razer and Essential phones, but it needs to be even better if it wants to beat the likes of Apple, OnePlus, Samsung, and Xiaomi.. The Nokia 8 is latest flagship device out of the stables of the Finnish smartphone manufacturer. The device comes with high-end hardware and is a much-improved variant of the Nokia 6. The device does not differ much from its predecessor regarding looks, but sports narrow bezels and has curved edges that prove pretty helpful while holding the device. The front-facing home button also acts as a fingerprint reader .. The Nokia 8 features an impressive 5.3-inch QHD display which is paired with excellent viewing angles that are targeted to provide a unique visual experience while watching videos or playing games. The screen also comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection which ensures that the display on the smartphone remains scratch-free. The device runs the Android 7.1.1 Nougat operating system out of the box.. For shutterbugs, the device packs dual 13-megapixel rear cameras which are paired with a dual-tone LED flash which one can use to shoot images in the dark. There is a 13-megapixel front-facing shooter as well that you can use for selfies and video calling.. In terms of performance, the smartphone is backed by an octa-core Snapdragon 835 chipset which is clocked at 2.5GHz which ensures a smooth and flawless smartphone experience. The chipset is coupled with massive 4GB of RAM to take care of your multitasking requirements.. Fuelled by a non-removable Li-Ion 3,090mAh battery, the device carries enough juice to keep it running for an entire day. For heavy users, the battery comes with fast charging support. For connectivity, there are options like 4G, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, NFC, and a USB Type-C 3.1 reversible port.. You needn't worry about the storage either as the Nokia 8 ships with 64GB of onboard storage space that can be further expanded using a microSD card up to 256GB..

Please ask the question in above box. Is it better than Samsung Galaxy S8?. For me this phone has better (best) build quality. It's robust and feels good in the hand.

Does it support 2G, 3G, 4G, VoLTE, OTG, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity?. Yes, it supports 2G, 3G, 4G, VoLTE, OTG, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.. To exchange files and images, and also to play songs with NFC compatible speakers.. Does it have a good camera clarity than iPhone?. Carl Zeiss lens+optical image stabilization produces very high-quality images. Nokia was always known for best images check sample images of earlier models like (N73/N79), and you will come to know yourself.. No, but it has better than Oppo, Vivo and Samsung.. Nothing can beat the Vivo camera.. Yes, it is better than iPhone.. 20 Ratings 7 Reviews. 5 11. 4 7. 3 1. 2 0. 1 1. Rate & review this product and help other customers.

The Nokia 8 is a flagship phone through and through, with major components and features that are ostensibly a match for the best that Samsung, HTC and LG can muster. Despite this, it comes with a £500 price tag that’s slightly lower than most of its 2017 rivals – apart from the £450 OnePlus 5T, which, in many ways, is the most direct comparison here.. But simple spec-box ticking was never enough for Nokia during its feature phone pomp, and it isn’t enough to win you market share in the jam-packed Android flagship field. You need a distinctive angle and a little sprinkling of design magic, and I’m not sure the Nokia 8 has quite enough of either.. Nokia was renowned for its distinctive hardware design and impeccable build quality way before Apple arrived on the scene. This is the reason it’s in this, more than any other area, that the Nokia 8 will probably be scrutinised above rivals.. The Nokia 8 stands up pretty well for the most part. There’s nothing to fault its design for other than a lack of wow factor.. It’s a pretty typical slab of aluminium and glass, with curved edges and subtle plastic antennas on the top and bottom edges. There’s a little raised aluminium rim around its dual-camera, and you’ll find a recessed, non-clicky home button/fingerprint sensor below the display; this is flanked by capacitive back and app-switching buttons.. I moved to the Nokia 8 straight from using a OnePlus 5 , and it was notable how fundamentally similar the two phones are. In fact, you could cut that last paragraph and paste it into a review of the other phone – although, for my money, the OnePlus 5 is slightly better-looking.. That’s not to say that Nokia and hardware partner HMD has pinched any of its design ideas from OnePlus. Indeed, there are numerous Android handsets on the market that fit this description, and it’s a shame that the Nokia doesn’t really do anything to distinguish itself given the brand’s heritage.. Still, there’s no faulting the phone’s feel in the hand. However, I fear that it’s will feel rather dated rather quickly with the accelerating shift towards bezel-free designs – but for now, it’s thoroughly pleasant to look at and hold in a late-2015 kind of a way.. The Nokia 8 has a certain heft to it at 7.9mm thick and 160g, but you wouldn’t call it an excessively large phone. I’d have preferred it to be a tad smaller given the phone’s relatively small display, but it’s fine.. It should also be noted that I had the more understated matte blue model to test. There’s a shiny copper option that would almost certainly make a much bigger visual impact, if that’s what you’re after.. You don’t get the same level of water- or dust-proofing here as you do with many other flagship phones these days, but an IP54 rating is enough to ensure the Nokia 8 at least offers dust- and splash-resistance. That’s one design feature it has over the OnePlus 5.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

The power and volume keys are situated close together along the right-hand edge, and so would have benefitted from a little textural differentiation – especially since they’re angled away from your face. On several occasions, usually when playing a game or watching a video, I found myself putting the phone to sleep when I wanted to turn down the volume.. But my main complaint regarding the controls lies with the Nokia 8’s fingerprint sensor. It’s plenty fast enough when you line up your finger properly, but I found it to be a little too small compared to the likes of the sensors on the OnePlus 5 and the iPhone 7. It led to a few too many misreads as I failed to align my thumb properly – although you’ll probably adjust to this over a longer period of use.. Nokia has taken the somewhat unusual step of fitting the Nokia 8 with a smaller-than-typical display. At 5.3 inches, you still wouldn’t call it a compact phone, but 5.5 inches is the more typical size – and that’s only going to increase as edge-to-edge screens become the norm.. I didn’t have an issue with this unusual size at all, though. It’s still too big to use single-handed, but it shows off media and web content just fine.. It does make you question whether the choice of a Quad-HD resolution was strictly necessary. Again, I came to the Nokia 8 from the OnePlus 5 , which has a larger (5.5-inch) and much less pixel-dense (1080p) display, yet I wouldn’t say that there was a noticeable step up in visual fidelity.. There remains a question over QHD’s true smartphone worth for anything other than VR applications. Even the Samsung Galaxy S8’s huge – and brilliant – 5.8-inch screen defaults to 1080p.. Perhaps more meaningfully, Nokia has taken the decision to opt for LCD over OLED – and this display is a perfectly cool, crisp and bright (to the tune of 700 nits) example. But Nokia used to be known for its smart use of OLED in its Windows Phone days, particularly with its Glance readout, which is present here.. Related: When will my phone get Android 8 ?. The Glance screen is a dimly lit cluster of basic information such as the time, date, battery status and number of notifications that appears whenever you move the phone.. This used to make sense with Nokia’s OLED-equipped phones, since only the text would light up, making for a discrete heads-up summary tool. Here, however, the whole screen lights up a little. This can be particularly annoying at night, since the Glance screen remains on whilst charging.. There are absolutely no complaints with the Nokia 8’s performance or specs. It comes equipped with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chip, which is the go-to processor for 2017 flagship phones.. This is a super-fast yet energy-efficient SoC that will handle anything you throw at it with consummate ease, and which doesn’t suffer for the extra pixels of a QHD display. Backed by 4GB of RAM, and lacking a hefty custom skin, everything moves fluidly on the Nokia 8.. Of course, virtually every other flagship Android phone of 2017 has an identical spec, so this is really table stakes at this point. But the point remains, the Nokia 8 is a smooth operator.. Recent 3D games such as Gear.Club and Guns of Boom ran flat out during my test period, as did fast-paced 2D fare such as ReRunners; on a separate but related note, the downward-facing speaker is a little weedy and easy to cover up in such situations.. The phone doesn’t become too hot when such high-end tasks are running, either. Besides the energy-efficient Snapdragon 835 CPU, this is likely down to Nokia’s inclusion of a copper cooling pipe with a graphite shield, which apparently dissipates system heat across the phone’s body.. In terms of benchmarking, an average Geekbench 4 score of 6578 pitches the Nokia 8 right up there in between the OnePlus 5 (6719) and the Sony Xperia XZ Premium (6492).

CNET también está disponible en español.. This comeback kid could have been even more. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The Nokia 8 has two rear cameras and is packed with power. Its screen is bright and sharp.. The Bad It lacks some cutting-edge features for a high-end phone in 2017, like waterproofing and a slim, standout design.. The Bottom Line A decent all-rounder, the dual-camera Nokia 8 gets the job done, but it doesn’t come close to today’s true Android stars.. The Nokia 8 ( $405.19 at Amazon.com ) isn't disappointing because it's a bad phone. Actually, it's reliable, powerful and has a sharp, beautiful screen. What makes it disappointing is that as the first high-end Nokia phone to ever run Android -- something Nokia phones have only done since the Nokia 6 and its ilk. were announced this past March -- it fails to match the serious Android handsets of the day.. The Nokia 8 is "good," but it doesn't beat the curved-screen, water-resistant Galaxy S8 ( $597.42 at Amazon.com ) on design and specs, and it can't beat the steady OnePlus 5 ( $949.98 at Amazon.com ) on value. Nor does it have the LG G6 ( $569.95 at Amazon.com ) or V30 ( $749.99 at Best Buy ) 's whisper-slim bezels and full-face screen. It does include two cameras on the back, which take decent shots in monochrome and color, but photos don't surpass other dual-camera phones in quality. That leaves the Nokia 8 as a middle-of-the road Android device with a mismatched price tag that's too high for what you really get.. This phone is fine, but forgettable. And that's an enormous let-down for a once-loved brand trying to make a comeback. What the Nokia 8 needed was to dazzle.. Also read : Nokia 3310 review, the revamped classic that made you go bananas. Physically, the Nokia 8 looks dated, not an elite 2017 model that'll hold its appeal for the next year or more. The matte metal back feels nice to hold but it's instantly forgettable. It won't turn heads when you whip it out on the train. It looks identical to the much cheaper Nokia 5 , and that's a problem.. There's a highly polished blue or copper version, either of which I vastly prefer to the matte version and recommend finding, if you can -- currently none of the UK phone networks are offering the polished versions. The Nokia 8 is splashproof but not waterproof (something that's common on high-end phones such as the S8 and iPhones), removing yet another compelling reason to spend your money. While you're probably safe taking a quick call in light rain, a spilled drink will likely spell disaster for the Nokia 8.. I'd be more forgiving if Nokia was fiercely undercutting its rivals on price. But at £499 in the UK it's actually only marginally cheaper than the Galaxy S8, one of the most luxurious, high-performance phones on the market. (That UK price converts to $675 or AU$840. Official US and Australian availability is yet to be announced, though we have seen it sold via a third party on Amazon.com for $699.). In the power stakes, this phone can hold its own against the big boys. At its core is a top-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor with 4GB of RAM -- in our benchmark tests it easily matched the S8, HTC U11 ( $629.00 at Amazon.com ) and OnePlus 5. You'll find buttery-smooth navigation and apps that load quickly. It handled every game I threw its way.. The display's 2,560x1,440-pixel resolution makes text and images look pin sharp. Battery life is solid as well, achieving around 17 hours on our video rundown test. That puts it alongside the S8 and OnePlus 5 and far above the HTC U11, which only managed 13 hours. I comfortably got a day of use, though if you're a heavy user you'll still want to give it a full charge each night.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition....

The Nokia 8 offers a lot of great features such as a powerful chipset, dual-sensor camera and a perfectly sized QHD display, but compared to a lot of the competition right now it struggles to offer anything unique. With a super-high price point, the Nokia 8 is a good phone but far from a great one.. Beautiful design, especially with shiny effect. Dual-sensor rear camera with interesting software. Price is a touch higher than we'd hoped. Nokia 8 price and release date Out now in the UK and Australia, will not launch in the US Price was originally £499/AU$899 (about $700) We've now seen the price drop as low as £399/AU$690 Key features Dual-sensor rear camera that can take great bokeh images New 'Bothie' mode for both selfie and rear camera images Design and display One of the best looking Nokia phones ever Metal uni-body and available in four different colors with differing looks Vibrant 5.3-inch QHD display that's bright and looks stunning. The comeback of Nokia is perhaps the most interesting story in phones of 2017, and now its first range of devices seems to be complete, with the introduction of the brand new Nokia 8.. Earlier in the year HMD Global revealed it would be announcing new phones using the Nokia branding, and we’ve already seen the Nokia 3 , Nokia 5 and the Nokia 6 , which are all middling to good mid-range devices.. There was also the PR win of the new Nokia 3310 , which got people sitting up and taking notice, and now, finally, here’s the flagship device from the company that we’ve all been waiting for.. The Nokia 8 is now out in the UK and Australia, but those in the US haven't seen the phone yet. HMD Global has confirmed the phone won't be landing on US shores, despite there being a suggestion it would.. The phone launched at £499.99/AU$899, but we've already seen the price drop down to £399/AU$690. That price puts it below the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S8 , but still very much in high-end territory around the OnePlus 5T .. With the Nokia 8 being the brand’s first flagship for a few years, a big emphasis is being put on its camera, which was a highlight feature of the last Windows Phone Nokia devices from 2014.. The Nokia 8 features a dual-sensor rear shooter that can capture ‘bokeh’ images with an attractive background blur, and uses a RGB and monochrome sensor in tandem for better low light photography.. The camera has been made in partnership with Zeiss too, although it’s not entirely clear what input the German lens specialists have had.. There are lots of extra features squeezed in here in an attempt to make this one of the best phone cameras on the market.. You may have heard of the new ‘Bothie’ mode, which uses both the front-facing and rear-facing cameras at the same time, so you can capture what’s behind your phone – probably yourself – as well as what’s in front.. On top of that there’s also Nokia’s OZO 3D audio capture tech, which should allow for more immersive video when you’re recording.. The design of the Nokia 8 is one of the key elements, and it’s one of the most – if not the most – beautiful phones we’ve ever seen with the Nokia branding emblazoned on the rear.. It’s an aluminium unibody design with metal edges, but while the back is metal too, the feel on the rear will depend on which finish you opt for.. There are steel and tempered blue colors, but both of these have a matt finish, and look a little bit lackluster when put next to the shiny copper and blue options.. For our review we’ve used the steel and shiny blue options. The shiny blue finish is by far the more eye-catching, although you may want to invest in a case for it, as we found we’d picked up a few scratches after only a week or so of use.. The body of the phone is thin, coming in at 7.9mm at its thickest point, but the edges curve down, so it sits comfortably in the hand.. Weight : 160g Dimensions : 151.5 x 73.7 x 7.9mm OS : Android 7.1.1, upgrade ready to Oreo Screen size : 5.3-inch Resolution : 1440 x 2560 CPU : Snapdragon 835 RAM : 4GB of RAM Storage : 64GB Battery : 3,090mAh Rear camera : 13MP + 13MP dual lens Front camera : 13MP. Those with smaller hands may also enjoy this device, as it comes with a 5.3-inch screen. It’s an LCD panel that has a QHD resolution and 700 nits of brightness – that's high for a smartphone, and should mean your phone's display is easily viewable even in glaring sunlight.. Video looks beautiful on the Nokia 8, although at such a small screen size it’s unclear whether a QHD resolution is really necessary here. Nokia has yet to reveal if any virtual reality functionality is planned for the Nokia 8.. If you want your regular video to look great though, the super-bright and high-resolution display on the Nokia 8 will be a great fit for you. It offers 554 pixels per inch, although it doesn’t compete with the likes of the Sony Xperia XZ Premium with its 4K front panel.. Antenna bands are visible along the top and bottom of the phone, but these don’t detract from the overall look. The company has placed them on the top and bottom to try and give you a better signal when you’re holding the phone.. Below the screen is a fingerprint scanner, which sits between the two navigation buttons and is in an easy-to-reach position to tap to unlock the phone. We found it quick at unlocking the phone from a single tap, although it is quite small, so you need to make sure to place your thumb or finger precisely.. The Nokia 8 isn’t waterproof like the Samsung Galaxy S8 or iPhone 7 , but it’s splash-resistant at IP54, which should mean you’ll be able to use it in the rain without having to worry about flooding the internals..

CNET también está disponible en español.. Nokia finally has a flagship Android phone and it's beautiful. With a supercharged processor and dual camera stuffed inside a gorgeous metal body, the Nokia 8 is the phone we've been craving.. by August 16, 2017 11:45 AM PDT. Nokia's flagship phone lacks the luxury touch. Nokia finally has a flagship Android phone to get excited.... At last, there's a true Nokia flagship. Android phone to get excited about.. It's called the Nokia 8 and unlike existing Nokia Androids -- the 3 , 5 and 6 -- this one is a real powerhouse.. At its core is a top-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor with 4GB of RAM. I've already run some benchmark tests and its scores easily rival Samsung's Galaxy S8. In my experience so far, there's not much you can throw at this phone that it can't handle.. The 5.3-inch display is pin sharp, thanks to the ultra HD resolution (2,560x1,440 pixels) and it's bright enough to use under the midday sun.. Around the back you'll find two cameras. One shoots in color, the other only in black and white -- good news if you love dramatic, moody portraits. They both have 13-megapixel resolutions and both shoot video in 4K. There's a 13-megapixel camera on the front, and thanks to some software trickery you can take photos with both the front and back camera to combine them into a single, split-screen image.. I took the Nokia 8's camera for spin -- take a look through the gallery below to see how it performs.. Taking the Nokia 8's dual camera for a test drive. You can also livestream that split-screen view directly to YouTube or Facebook. It's not a killer feature for me personally, but you'll enjoy this unique skill if you love sharing your whole life with the world.. That's all wrapped up in a really slick metal body with a highly polished finish. I think it looks extremely smart and elegant, although it is something of a fingerprint magnet.. The phone is splash-proof, not waterproof, which is disappointing given that proper waterproofing is something we're now often seeing on top-end phones. On the upside, it has a fingerprint scanner on the front, a USB-C port and the latest version of Android Nougat on board.. The Nokia 8, which is made by HMD Global, will cost 599 euros when it goes on sale in September. The expected UK price is £599 and although there are currently no plans for it to reach the US or Australia yet, it's likely the phone will eventually go on sale in both countries. For reference, 599 euros converts to around $700 or AU$900.. No, it's not a cheap phone, and that price puts it squarely in line with the Galaxy S8 (a phone with pretty much the same specs, on paper), which you can now pick up on Amazon for $575 in the US or £560 in the UK. In Australia you can find it for AU$899. Then there's the OnePlus 5 , a superb Android phone that's also packed with top-notch tech and a brilliant dual camera system. It even won our coveted Editors' Choice award. The OnePlus costs even less at $479 in the US and £449 in the UK (AU$750, converted).. We'll have to wait to properly test the Nokia in our full review to decide on whether it's a wise purchase over the S8 or OnePlus 5. A price closer to or below $600, £500 or AU$750 would really help sweeten the deal. There's no question, however, that splashing that top-end cash will snag you a top-end phone that's absolutely worth considering, particularly if you have any sort of nostalgia for the Nokia name..

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery life, Price and alternatives, Conclusion. by Victor Hristov. Nokia - Nokia + Android - Android +. 4 Call Quality, Battery life, Price and alternatives, Conclusion. It has embraced Android and it’s got a Snapdragon 835 flagship phone to compete with the big guns like the iPhones, Galaxies and Pixels. Nokia has built its flagship smartphone following a few simple principles: keep Android clean and bloatware-free, deliver good performance, and provide timely software updates. In many ways, the Nokia 8 is a “stock” Android phone done right, with little flare except for that new “bothie” camera mode. There are a few things to keep in mind, though: the Nokia brand is now licensed to HMD Global: a different company with some Nokia executives at the helm, but it’s no longer that huge giant out of Finland with its own manufacturing plants. Secondly, while the Nokia 8 does feature hardware on the level of Samsung’s and Google’s best phones, it’s sold for a much lower price than the Galaxies or the Pixels. So how good is the Nokia 8 and does it live up to the expectations? Let’s find out. In the box: Phone Еarbuds, black, with 3 different sizes of rubber tips USB-C to standard USB cable, black Wall charger , black (supports fast charge, up to 18 watt output) Sim ejector tool User Manual Design Solid aluminum build quality with some curves for a better in-hand feel, but no water proofing. The Nokia 8 is a phone with a 5.3” screen of a traditional 16:9 aspect ratio. Its big bezels on the top and the bottom seem unnecessary and make it look a bit dated compared to all the “edge-to-edge” flagships out there. But what Nokia did right is the screen size. While many phones go with larger and larger displays these days, a 5.3” screen was picked for the Nokia 8 – a tad bit below the average, but of big benefit to actual comfort and ease of use. The Nokia 8 is not too big to carry in a pocket and not too big to do some things on it with just one hand. Here is the exact size of the phone: 5.96 x 2.90 x 0.31 inches (151.5 x 73.7 x 7.9 mm), weight of 5.64 oz (160 g) Nokia takes pride in the construction of the 8: it’s made of aluminum with very nice curves at the edges that make a big difference in terms of in-hand fit and feel. It’s not quite as sleek as say the OnePlus 5 and it does not feel as well made, but it’s not too far behind either. Up front you have a tiny home key with a fingerprint scanner built in it. It’s our first gripe with the Nokia 8: it’s too small and not as accurate as on other phones, so I often had to press it a few times and re-position my finger to get it to work. Those are all issues related to its too small size. Then we have the recents key on the right and the back key on the left, and there is no way to change their places. Unfortunately, there is no water-proofing on the Nokia 8, so be careful not to get it wet. On the bottom there is a single USB-C type port for charging and – thankfully – a headphone jack. Display The 5.3” screen might be sharp, but colors are cold and dull. The Nokia 8 ships with a 5.3” IPS LCD screen with Quad HD (1440 x 2560 pixel) resolution, which looks very, very sharp. We’ve already mentioned the situation with the big bezel on the top and bottom, it definitely looks outdated. The screen is the traditional 16:9 size, so most videos fit perfectly, without any black bars or cropping. How about the actual quality and the color reproduction, though? They are not great. In fact, among the top phones out there, we’d say that the Nokia 8 ranks worst. Colors are very cold, the screen looks a bit dim and lacking vibrancy. There are no additional color modes, no fine settings, so what you see is what you get, and the screen is definitely one of the weaker spots in the Nokia 8. On a positive side, it does get very bright, peaking over 700 nits, which helps a lot for outdoor visibility (but does not matter much for anything else). The display also has something like an “always-on display” function that shows you the date and how many missed notifications you have and from which app. Unfortunately, text on the screen is too dim in this mode and it’s very hard to see, rendering the option nearly useless.. 5.96 x 2.9 x 0.31 inches. 151.5 x 73.7 x 7.9 mm. 5.86 x 2.68 x 0.31 inches. 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0 mm. 6.07 x 2.92 x 0.29 inches. 154.2 x 74.1 x 7.25 mm. 5.86 x 2.83 x 0.31 inches. 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software..

'It lacks personality, it’s just another Android phone'. You could say that for every iPhone from iPhone 6 to iPhone 8 : 'It lacks personality, it’s just another iPhone'..

We don't mention it explicitly in the cons section of the review because it's virtually the same design as in previous years.. (Posts: 407; Member since: 15 Mar 2013). posted on 24 Oct 2017, 07:48.

The OnePlus feels way thinner, has more ergonomic curves and none of the contrasty, unsightly antenna bands.. (Posts: 541; Member since: 29 Aug 2014). posted on 26 Oct 2017, 11:24.

Besides, regarding "well made", go check out both phones on. Jerry rig everything on youtube and find out that your"feeling" is (BS) wrong too. If that not enough read up on both phones manufacturing process. If still not enough, go to a doctor and have them test your finger sensitivity. You probably lost all fingertip feeling. (Posts: 78; Member since: 05 Dec 2012). posted on 28 Oct 2017, 03:53. Guess it comes down to personal preference. In fact, I haven't even noticed the antenna bands when I used the device and didn't find it a problem at all. For me the design of the device is a 5 out 5. (Lesser bezels would have been a plus, but it's not a con at all.). Coming to build quality, I would say the Nokia 8 feels way much better than the OnePlus 5. I actually went and checked both the devices again to confirm this. But considering that I've personally used the device and that I've read a lot of reviews for the Nokia 8 from different tech people, I would say that its build is really well made. I don't remember any reviewers complaining about the build quality of the phone.. (Posts: 26; Member since: 02 Jun 2013). posted on 28 Oct 2017, 16:58. in response to #37 Hide. if on doubt check jerry rig everything on youtube. One plus 5, bend and add screen pop out. Nokia 8, doesn't bulge...not even a little as his knuckles turn white from pressing from front or rear. iPhoneArena has the feeling of an infant obviously as they are the only site complaining. Nokia 8 64/4Gb is A LOT CHEAPER than iCrap8 , but few Apple People trust the chinapopup oneplus (for good reasons) and thus the main competitor Nokia, is pushed into the gutter without relevant testing.

You should think a little bit about yourself and why are you doing this. You just mess up the reputation of the phonearena.com. (Other reviews from all over the world shows totally other picture about the device... They are all wrong or just you?) Peace... (Posts: 26; Member since: 02 Jun 2013). posted on 26 Oct 2017, 12:00. A bunch of facts, that he obviously did not like to show to the community as they proved him totally wrong and biased. I am sure this comment will disappear too. Or maybe they don't like being called iPhoneArena even though everyone knows the bias here :). (Posts: 541; Member since: 29 Aug 2014). posted on 26 Oct 2017, 11:23. Kind of knew iPhone arena was gonna give bad review for Nokia 8. What about pure Android experience without Samsung-style bloatware? Not a plus, eh?. (Posts: 2; Member since: 16 Jan 2017). posted on 26 Oct 2017, 15:22. It's funny to read this review. It's look like you and the boys from gsmarena are testing different examples of Nokia8. For you the phone is smooth,but not the smoothies and for the is the best in this aspect. For you the screen is dull for them is one of the best LCD screen on a phone. My wife always had android phone, but her dream was iPhone. I bought it iPhone 7 and guess what? She told me that this expensive toy doesn't deserve the money it cost here in Europe. But for you iPhones will always get 9+ out of 10, even if iPhone9 or 8s have the same size, ugly bezels and etc.. (Posts: 1; Member since: 29 Oct 2017). posted on 29 Oct 2017, 18:15. With all these bad points about the camera and its interface, is there a chance that you can take better photos using manual settings like ISO and exposure? Is there a possibillity that an update can fix some of these issues?. (Posts: 1; Member since: 30 Oct 2017). posted on 30 Oct 2017, 08:17. No wonder your Nokia 8 review just can be found on page 2 of google search.. Your review are so biased, not so trusted like other respectable review site.

HMD Global has had an eventful year and made its power-packed entry into the Indian smartphone market with the launch of three Nokia powered smartphone. But the true test of its credentials was always going to be its flagship smartphone – Nokia 8. Priced at Rs 35,999, the smartphone has all the essential features of a flagship and it also looks pretty good. Will it help Nokia to regain its lost crown and bring back the glory days? We try to find out in our review as we used the Nokia 8 for quite some time and here is our word about the smartphone. Design and display Nokia 8 is the flagship smartphone from HMD and looking at its design it truly represents one. The smartphone comes with classic aluminium and glass body design. The device comes with a matte finished smooth rear panel with curved edges. The top and bottom consists of the antenna lines covered with plastic. The front of the smartphone is dominated by a 5.3-inch display, Nokia logo, 13MP selfie camera, two capacitive keys and a pill shaped fingerprint sensor which also doubles up as the home button. The SIM card slot is placed on the left side, while the power button and volume rockers are located on the right. The 3.5mm audio jack is there on the top, whereas the USB type C charging slot and speaker grill are placed at the bottom. *Lag-free performance *Good camera *Impressive design.

I doubt if Nokia can get back to the lost glory, especially when there are so many players providing new-new apps and features every now and then. Being flagship Nokia ought to keep the price at this level but there is strong competition from present successful and established players. Leave aside the market leader in given segment, I would like to see how much Nokia is able to make out of this pretty decent phone in this fast changing market.. The bothie feature is pretty old. Not sure why that''s come as a feature. My LG g4 has that feature which released in 2015.

Dimensions and weight 151.5 x 73.7 x 7.9 mm. HMD Global has just unveiled what will be the very first Nokia flagship running Android: the Nokia 8. Historical significance aside, does the Nokia 8 represent the return to form that legions of Nokia fans have been waiting for? Well, it certainly looks and feels a whole lot like a 2017 flagship and like many flagships, it has a killer feature to set itself apart. As Nokia has been known to do in the past, theyâre putting the major emphasis on the camera â or should I say cameras â and the addition of some unique tricks should make it a great choice for content creators and the Instagram generation. HMD themselves have described the Nokia 8 as the âultimate device for documenting your lifeâ, which will certainly appeal to a specific audience.. But will that be enough to compete with existing heavy hitters?. For those not in the know, HMD Global is a Finnish company that acquired the Nokia brand license just eight months ago and has already given us the Nokia 3, 5 and 6. This is their first stab at a real flagship though, and having just reviewed the Nokia 5 , I was eager to see how a high end model would hold up and whether HMD would be able to fly the flag proudly for the Nokia brand (no pun intended!).. To look at, the Nokia 8 is off to a good start. The Nokia 8 has most of the hallmarks of a modern flagship, while continuing the design language of the last three models. It has an attractive and very slim all-aluminum design with an average thickness of 7.3mm. Itâs 4.6mm at its thinnest point and 7.9mm at its thickest.. The design supposedly curves like this in order to pack maximum performance into a sleek body and HMD says you ‘won’t find a straight line’ in the design. The Nokia 8 comes in matte silver, matte blue, polished blue and an eye-grabbing polished copper, colors which adorn the back of the device but not the front.. On the front is a 5.3-inch QHD 2,560 x 1,440 IPS LCD display with 700 nits of brightness. It certainly looked very vibrant, bright and crisp in my brief testing period (admittedly only indoors). There’s also a fingerprint sensor around the front on an indented home button â which is my personally preferred placement, but your mileage may vary.. While rather stunning from the rear, the Nokia 8 is also something of a fingerprint magnet and is. Those bezels are also starting to look a little bit like last year compared to some other top-of-the-range phones now available.. The Nokia 8 is also not waterproof but rather only splash-proof with an IP54 rating. That’s something that some users have come to expect from flagships (much like bezel-less displays) so this might be a blow for some. While the Nokia 8 is a great looking phone, it’s not Galaxy S8 great…. Specs-wise, the Nokia 8 puts up a good showing and is able to trade blows with other flagships. It’s powered by a 2.45 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 and is backed up by 4 GB of RAM. This duo should make it more than capable of handling even the most demanding tasks.. What might also help out here is some advanced cooling that makes use of a copper pipe and graphite shielding in order to disperse heat evenly across the phone. That means there should be no âhot spotâ under stress which will reportedly allow you to push the performance harder for longer.. Another thoughtful design choice was placing the antennae at the top and bottom of the phone, which should prevent them from getting covered by your hand while you use it. This should also allow for some of the best signal sensitivity in the industry and potentially better battery life. We’ll have to get back to you on this in the full review though.. The Nokia 8 comes with 64 GB of internal storage. There will be both a single SIM and a dual SIM version, with the second SIM tray accepting an SD card to expand storage by up to 256 GB. The battery is a 3,090 mAh cell with Quick Charge 3.0 via USB Type-C, but better signal sensitivity and a stripped-down Android experience means this should last you a decent amount of time.. You can expect an entirely clean Android experience from the Nokia 8 and Nokia promises owning one will be one of the fastest ways to get Android O.. You can expect an entirely clean Android experience ( Android 7.1.1 out of the box) with no additional customization or bloatware. Everything from the dialer and keyboard to the contacts uses Googleâs Mobile Services and HMD explains that it wouldnât have been adding anything by making changes âjust to be differentâ.. The stock Android experience also means that the device will receive quicker updates; Nokia promises that owning the Nokia 8 will be one of the fastest ways to get Android O in your hands. Reportedly, the new OS is already being tested on the handset. Personally, I quite like to see customizations from OEMs to add a little unique flavour to the experience, but I know Iâm largely in the minority there.. Saving the best for last, the star of the show here is the camera. The Nokia 8 camera is the result of a partnership between HMD and Zeiss and is the core experience the phone is designed around.. The rear shooter utilizes two sensors: one color and one monochrome. The two images are then combined into a single shot with greater contrast using âImage Fusion Technologyâ. This is essentially what we have seen from several other handsets recently, such as the Honor 9 and Huawei P10. There’s also a two-tone flash and both apertures are f/2.0.. Related: Who is Carl Zeiss?. Both rear sensors are 13 MP, but in a unique twist, so too is the front-facing camera which, in fact, utilizes the exact same camera module. That means you also get auto focus, which is another rare feature for a selfie-camera (though it was something we also saw in the S8, slightly dodgy though the implementation there was). The reasoning behind this is to support what the company sees as the Nokia 8âs âkiller featureâ: the âbothieâ.. Both rear sensors are 13 MP, but in a unique twist, so too is the front-facing camera, which also has auto focus.. Nokia wants this phone to be the âultimate device for telling your storyâ. Thus, itâs bothie feature allows users to snap photos or record video using footage from both the front and rear cameras, split down the middle 50/50.. This âbothieâ mode is intended to allow users to âtell the whole storyâ. Whether shooting in this mode or just recording regular video, both can be streamed directly to Facebook Live or YouTube natively from the camera app.. I found the Nokia 8 camera to be a good shooter capable of some detailed, contrasty shots, but I was unable to get the photos off the device, so weâll need more time to test before we can make a final verdict.. I was a little disappointed not to see more features in the camera app (which was developed in-house) and particularly at the lack of manual settings. Though perhaps youâll be able to tweak these with a third party solution, as with the Google Pixel.. The Nokia 8 is the first time we've seen Ozo Audio on a mobile device, which is usually reserved for Hollywood VR cameras.. What also makes the Nokia 8 a good choice for content creators is top-tier audio recording, with the phone using Ozo Audio. This is an audio solution found in VR cameras previously only used by Hollywood and is the first time weâve seen it on a mobile device.. Using multiple microphones, it can capture a high dynamic range and record binaural audio. This means that someone watching your Facebook livestream with headphones will be able to hear stereo sound with no need to own specific software themselves. In theory, the audio quality should be able to match the video when capturing your story on the move and if you’re someone who enjoys live streaming, this will be a big boon.. For a killer feature, Iâm not sure that the bothie mode is really anything that couldnât be accomplished on any other device with the right app (*cough* gimmick *cough*), but having the feature so readily available means that more users will be likely to try it and it is a good way to showcase what the phone is really all about.. Whether bothie video becomes something content creators will adopt into their videos will remain to be seen. I personally don’t see how having my gurning mug take up half the screen is going to add value to my videos… but your mileage may vary there.. More to the point though, a 13 MP front-facing camera with auto focus is a compelling feature and one that will no doubt appeal to vloggers, backpackers or anyone else who enjoys turning the camera on themselves. And when you couple that with the sleek design, the âpureâ Android experience and the top of the range specs, Iâm sure there will be a large audience for the phone.. The Nokia 8 will be available globally on September 6. for a price of 599 EUR (details on US pricing to come). Weâll have the full review ready for you then, so we can find out if this is a truly competitive flagship from Nokia and whether the Nokia 8 really is the ultimate phone to document your life with..

The Nokia 8, which like its predecessors comes crafted from a single piece of aluminium, has shunned the recent shift towards bezel-less smartphones and comes equipped with a physical home button, which houses a baked-in fingerprint sensor.. The Nokia 8's standout feature, at least according to HMD Global, is its camera, as it's the first Android-powered Nokia phone to pack Carl Zeiss optics. There's a 13MP dual setup on the rear of the phone, which - much like the camera on the. - pairs RGB and monochrome sensors for better image quality.

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. Nokia 8's dual-camera is good, but rival phones offer more. It doesn't do justice to the label's imaging heritage.. The Nokia 8 broke cover in the run-up to IFA 2017, so while it wasn't officially launched at the show in Germany, it's one of several phones vying for your cash ahead of a certain company's next phone. It's the most accomplished Android phone that Nokia has made, but with Nokia's tradition of pushing mobile-imaging forward, how does it fare against the mighty cameraphone competition in 2017? We took an early device around Berlin to see how it fared.. Gallery: Nokia 8 camera shoot out at IFA 2017 | 21 Photos. So has Nokia kept up? It's certainly tried to. Pairing two camera sensors together is the 2017 thing to do with flagship phones, and with the Nokia 9, it's a combination of two 13-megapixel sensors. One deals in monochrome; the other, in color. That monochrome sensor helps the phone to deal with low-light and other difficult shooting environments, while also offering the opportunity for true black-and-white photography -- right from the source.. My monochrome shots turned to be some of my favorite images -- it was a feature that several editors at Engadget also loved on Huawei's P10. However, it doesn't quite pack the punch of that phone, which used a mightier 20-megapixel sensor -- that's seven megapixels beyond the Nokia handset, and so images are a little flatter, a little less textured.. So how about "twin" mode, which combines the input from the two sensors all at once? They're good, but not stellar. Damning with faint praise perhaps, but while some pictures came out wonderfully, I was often disappointed by either the dynamic range (blue skies would wash out anything else in the frame) or underperforming focus. Many of the test shots you see here are my "best" ones: 13 megapixels should be more than enough for crisp shots, but the Nokia 8, despite those Zeiss lenses , delivered merely good images — not great. Color accuracy was generally good, but I felt many of my images were a little muted compared to reality, even with HDR mode turned on. A sunny day in Berlin is the chance for a smartphone to shine, but my photos don't seem to show that. This was further compounded when comparing the results against LG's V30 in similar conditions.. Also, after being spoiled with the camera-app control options of Nokia's Lumia phones years ago, the lack of true manual controls and tweaks was also disappointing. There are three focus modes: include center-weighted, evaluative -- which generally involves face detection -- and old-fashioned auto, while there's similarly limited options for focal range photography. Macro, infinite distance and auto are your three only options. And that software-driven bokeh mode that we're seeing on most smartphones with two lenses? The Nokia 8's interpretation of it is just not that good. It typically smeared objects outside the main area of focus and usually neglected to take into account the details of, say, the stag statue antlers.. That's not to say there's nothing to play with inside the camera app. The simple control UI includes the ability to combine the front facing camera with the rear-facing duo for simultaneous photos and video. This is what a "bothie" is made of.. The good parts: The cameras on both the front and back use the same resolution, so your images don't look particularly uneven. There were, however, times when the front-facing camera struggled with changes in lighting. The biggest problem was the physical challenge of lining up what you're trying to capture. I took some "bothie" video as we drove around the Berlin Victory Column during the photography testing, and it was hard to balance capturing both the building and myself in the back of the car. You could say that's fine for rough-and-ready live broadcasts, but it's difficult to make anything look particularly good. A wider-angle lens on the front-facing camera would have alleviated things.. And about that live-casting: Nokia added the ability to live-stream directly from the camera app to YouTube or Facebook -- which is a smart idea. However, when trying it out, I barely seemed to notice that hyped-up Nokia OZO-branded audio recording. Despite promises of 360-degree directional audio and three microphones embedded inside the phone, the quality was pretty rough. My voice blasted out on Facebook, while video compression wrecked the quality of the video. This isn't completely the fault of the Nokia 8: Phone signal quality and Facebook's own compression tricks are all involved. But the bottom line is that I don't want to share something that sounds grating and looks muddy. Another issue I had was the delay in switching between the two sensors on the back of the Nokia 8. This was a problem with several of the first wave of dual-lens camera phones last year, but most have figured out how to speed up this transition. We got to test this Nokia 8 ahead of its retail launch in Europe, so there is the chance that the company can tweak some of these issues through software updates. At this point, there's certainly plenty for the engineers to work on..

Kunal Dua , 17 October 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Nokia 8 marks the return of the brand to the big league. The big marketing feature is its Dual Sight camera aka 'bothie' mode. Nokia 8 price in India is Rs. Nokia 8 design and display Nokia 8 performance, software, and battery life Nokia 8 cameras. HMD Global announced the re-entry of the Nokia brand in the mobile market late last year, and the Nokia 6 became the first phone to be unveiled under the new arrangement. This was followed by the launch of the Nokia 5 and the Nokia 3 , with the focus very much on the entry-level segment. That changed in August when the Nokia 8 was unveiled at a special event in London. This device is the realisation of a long-held dream of many enthusiasts - a Nokia-branded Android smartphone with flagship-class specifications.. The Nokia 8 packs the Snapdragon 835 SoC - a chip that nearly all current-generation Android flagships are built around - and comes with near-stock Android. That means there’s little room for differentiation in terms of specifications or software. Instead, like many other OEMs, HMD is pinning its hopes on the camera to act as the big selling proposition for its most expensive smartphone till date.. To that end, HMD has revived Nokia’s iconic partnership with Carl Zeiss AG - the brand that lent its name to many famous Nokia camera phones back in the day - for the front and rear cameras of the Nokia 8. The phone also packs some new tricks like the ability to capture ‘bothies’ and record spatial 360 O audio thanks to technology borrowed from Nokia’s Ozo camera. Is that enough to make the Nokia 8 stand out in a crowded market? Let’s find out.. At first glance, there’s nothing striking about the Nokia 8, especially from the front. It has a fairly standard design, with the 5.3-inch display dominating most of the front, and thin, yet noticeable borders on the left and right. Below the display is the oval home button with a built-in fingerprint scanner, flanked by the capacitive Back and Recent buttons on either side. There’s an earpiece above the display, with a selfie camera to its left and a Nokia logo at the far right. The bottom edge of the Nokia 8 has the Type-C USB 3.1 Gen. 1 port, a mic, and the mono speaker, while the 3.5mm audio port is on top. The SIM/ microSD tray is on the left, and the volume controls and power/ wake button are on the right.. Flip the phone over and things start to get a bit more interesting. The top third has the dual camera module and dual-LED flash lined up in the centre, with ZEISS branding separating them. All this is housed in a small ‘island’ of glass surrounded by an oval-shaped metallic ring that gives the Nokia 8 a tiny camera bump at the back. Another Nokia logo adorns the centre of the phone’s back, and there’s a fair amount of regulatory text towards the bottom, including the ‘Made in India’ tag on our review unit. The antenna bands at the top and bottom blend in nicely with the rest of the phone.. Nokia 8 in Tempered Blue (left) and Steel matte finishes.. The Nokia 8’s body is made from 6000-series aluminium, and it comes in glossy Polished Copper and Blue finishes, as well as matte Tempered Blue and Steel options. We got to try both the matte finishes for extended periods of time for our review and found the overall feel and finish to be a notch above other devices in this price segment. We criticised the OnePlus 5 for its uninspiring design in our review , and now, purely in terms of design, it feels extremely dated in comparison to the Nokia 8.. The Nokia 8 has a 5.3-inch QHD IPS LCD screen with a resolution of 1440x2560 pixels that might lack the appeal of an ‘edge to edge’ display, but holds up against the best in the business where it counts. The screen boasts of accurate colour reproduction and it can get really bright when needed, which means using the phone under direct sunlight wasn’t a problem. HMD Global has also used Gorilla Glass 5 for protection.. In the Nokia 8 retail box, you get a 12.5W charger, a USB Type-A to Type-C cable, 3.5mm earphones, a SIM eject tool, and the user guide.. As we mentioned earlier, the Nokia 8 is powered by the Snapdragon 835 SoC, which is now standard fare across most Android flagships of this generation. It is backed by 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a 3090mAh battery, non-removable, of course. India gets the dual-SIM variant of the Nokia 8, but you will have to choose between a Nano-SIM and a microSD card for the second slot. 4G support with VoLTE is available on both SIMs, but only one can be using 4G at any given time.. Nokia 8 has a 5.3-inch QHD IPS LCD with Gorilla Glass 5 for protection.. In our experience, call quality was was excellent and 4G connectivity was good even in areas where other phones usually struggle. The mono speaker can get sufficiently loud for calls and even watching videos, and the sound doesn't break even at maximum volume. However, the placement at the bottom right means you could easily end up covering it while watching a video or playing a game. The Nokia 8 is IP54-rated, which means it’s not waterproof, though you do get protection from water sprays.. The Nokia 8 ships with near-stock Android, with the most noticeable customisations being to the camera app, which we will get to in detail shortly. The lack of software bloat combined with the beefy hardware meant that day to day performance during our review period was a breeze. Multi-tasking wasn't a problem either, which just goes to show that you don't need 6GB or 8GB of RAM to make a decent phone. The phone did not get warm even with extended sessions of Breakneck and Asphalt 8, and both games ran without any noticeable issues. In terms of benchmarks, the Nokia 8 was up there with other Snapdragon 835 powered phones.. As we noted at launch , the Nokia 8 has been engineered with an elaborate heat management solution: a copper pipe runs from the upper right corner of the device to the lower left, and is filled with liquid that evaporates in the middle and condenses when it is carried to the edges, in a continuous cycle that carries heat away from the main components. There’s also a graphite layer that transfers the heat to the aluminium unibody uniformly, using a larger surface area to dissipate it to the air.. The Nokia 8 ships with Android 7.1.1 out of the box, which means you get features like App Shortcuts (the ability to initiate actions in apps by long-pressing their icons) and Jump to Camera, the ability to launch the camera app from anywhere (including the lock screen) by double-tapping the power/ lock button. HMD Global has promised updates to Android Oreo and even to next year's Android P release for the Nokia 8 and other smartphones in its current lineup.. Android 7.1.1's App Shortcuts on the Nokia 8 (left). The phone also comes with some motion-triggered shortcuts.. You also get the Glance screen feature, that we saw on Lumia phones back in the day. Your Nokia 8 can display badges for missed calls and unread emails and messages, as well as alarms and calendar appointments on the lock screen. It’s set to timeout one minute after your phone has been set down, but you can change this value to as much as 20 minutes to mimic an ‘always-on’ display. There are a couple of motion-triggered shortcuts as well, though both options are turned off by default. You can turn over your Nokia 8 to reject a call, or have it muted on pickup, if you choose to do so.. In our HD video battery loop test, the Nokia 8 lasted nearly twelve and a half hours, which is pretty impressive. In terms of real-world performance, we didn't find ourselves reaching for the charger before the end of the day even when our phone usage was heavier than usual. If your experience varies, the bundled 12.5W charger can take the Nokia 8 from an empty tank to a 45 percent charge in 30 minutes, and we also noted it going from 50 percent to 66 percent in just 15 minutes.. The Nokia 8 has a dual rear camera setup: a 13-megapixel colour sensor with optical image stabilisation, and a monochrome sensor of the same resolution. While the use of a wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens to offer optical zoom has been been made popular by the likes of Apple , Samsung , and OnePlus , this arrangement is designed to maximise image quality, and has been seen before as well, especially on Honor phones.. How it works is pretty simple: every time you take a photo, two shots are captured - one by the colour sensor and the other by the monochrome sensor - and combined to give you a resulting colour image. The extra information available from the monochrome sensor helps improve the overall contrast and richness of each frame - at least that's the idea in theory.. We mentioned earlier that the Nokia 8 runs near-stock Android, and it's the Camera app that's largely responsible for that "near" prefix. You'll see a ton of customisations here, most of them to accommodate the underlying camera hardware. The app is set to capture still photos in the 'Twin' mode by default, but you can change that to just 'Colour' or 'Mono' if you so desire. We recommend leaving it in the default mode, unless you are trying to take black and white shots, of course, in which case go with the latter.. Though the camera is backed by phase detection auto-focus (PDAF) and an IR range finder, in our experience, the Nokia 8 took a bit too long to lock focus, which got annoying really quickly. The resulting pictures, however, were good, with the right objects in focus and a good amount of detail as well as accurate colour reproduction, as long as there was plenty of light around us.. Tap to see full-sized Nokia 8 camera samples. In low light conditions, though, the performance of the Nokia 8 suffered, which wasn't exactly a surprise given the f/2.0 aperture on both cameras. Pictures we shot didn't have a lot of noise, but they lacked the details that today’s leading smartphone cameras can capture, though, admittedly, most of them are priced higher than the Nokia 8. The rear flash does a good job of lighting up scenes, though the front-facing display flash can be a bit overpowering.. Speaking of which, the Nokia 8 can record 720p, 1080p, or 4K video using both front and rear cameras, though you are limited to 30 frames per second. The quality of videos is decent, and though the microphones seem to do a great job of picking up sounds, we couldn’t discern the difference, if any, made by the Ozo surround sound. You can also record slow-motion and time-lapse videos.. The app also features Live Bokeh and Panorama modes, and the results of both are pretty good. You also get Beautify mode for both the front and rear cameras, complete with varying intensity levels of this 'beautification', which is designed to remove 'blemishes' from your face - embracing your natural self is clearly so 2014. Controls to toggle HDR mode, the timer, and the flash are available within the main interface for both front and rear cameras, and you can even dive into a fully manual mode with either.. The camera app on the Nokia 8 has been customised to accomodate the underlying hardware.. The app can be a bit confusing at times - for example, you might wonder “Why am I not seeing the ‘switch cameras’ option right now?” The answer is usually the fact that you are in a mode that doesn’t support the option you’re looking for. Switching from Live Bokeh to regular Photos mode, for example, will fix the issue in that scenario. The icon at the bottom indicating the current mode could have been bigger, or having a carousel showing all available modes at any given time like the iPhone and several other phones would perhaps have made it easier to understand what is currently selected.. That brings us to the Dual Sight camera, or to use the marketing term, ‘bothie’ mode. You can take photos and record video with the Nokia 8 where scenes from both the front and the rear camera will be visible at the same time. The unfortunate marketing name aside, this could be a nice way to, say, record your own reactions when your kid is doing something cute. Resulting images are 16:9, instead of 4:3 when capturing stills using a single camera on the Nokia 8 by default (this can also be changed to 16:9 from Settings within the Camera app, if you want).. We’ve seen third-party apps and other Android phones do this before, but what HMD is really pushing here is the ability to livestream bothie (and indeed ‘regular’) videos to Facebook and YouTube right from within the camera app. The company says it worked closely with Qualcomm to be the first to push this feature out, but you can expect it to be available on other smartphones soon.. We can imagine this feature being useful when you are at, say, a concert, or if you are a reporter covering a live event, when you want to capture both sides of the story. The streaming feature worked as advertised, though we should note that you might need to verify your YouTube account and enable live streaming manually to stream to Google’s platform. Extended bothie streaming sessions can warm up the back of the phone considerably, which is a sign that the heat management solution we described earlier is doing its job.. Tap to see full-sized Nokia 8 bothie sample. Quality of photos and videos taken in bothie mode is decent, but not as good as you can capture when using the individual cameras normally. Note that there is no way to use the bothie mode outside of the stock Camera app at the moment.. Verdict Nokia made its name selling no-nonsense phones that were built to last, and while the ownership of the mobile brand might have changed hands, the Nokia 8 is a smartphone that would have been a worthy addition to the lineup of the Finnish company even in its heyday. It offers good build quality, a great display, excellent performance with stock Android, the promise of regular updates, first-class battery life, and good cameras with some neat tricks. On the flip-side, some might find the design boring, it isn’t fully waterproof like many competitors are, and the low-light camera performance could’ve been better.. 36,999, the Nokia 8 goes up against the likes of the OnePlus 5 ( Review ), and overall, we found it to be the better of the two, despite the latter sporting better specifications on paper. If you are on a tighter budget, you could also consider the Honor 8 Pro ( Review ), which has a similar dual-camera setup and is a solid all-round performer as well.. Expectedly, the overall experience with the Nokia 8 isn’t as polished as it is with some of the more expensive Android smartphones such as the HTC U11 ( Review ) and Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Note 8 flagships, but it’s safe to say that if a smartphone like this had shipped from the Nokia stable a few years ago, the Finnish company might never have had to step back from the mobile business. As for taking on the likes of Samsung and Apple at their own game, there’s the rumoured Nokia 9 to look forward to ..

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. There’s a world where Finland’s Nokia never left the smartphone market, where it moved seamlessly from Symbian OS to Android, where the summer of 2017 saw the release of a flagship smartphone with the SnapDragon 835 system on chip, dual lens camera, and the latest version of Android to huge anticipation and critical acclaim.. This is not that world, much as many romantic dreamers may want it to be. Nokia’s decision to switch from Symbian to Windows Phone in 2011 fundamentally changed the industry. It gave Samsung a clear run at being the lead Android manufacturer, it allowed Apple space to claim the voice of the innovator in the space and it left Europe without a major player as the smartphone took over the world.. This world now has HMD Global , a small Finnish startup that has licensed the Nokia brand name in the mobile space. HMD Global is working with Foxconn subsidiary FIH Mobile to manufacture new devices and is using a stock version of Android as the operating system. Yes, It says Nokia on the box and the handset, yes the Nokia Mobile brand is being used in marketing rather than HMD Global, but behind the spin, the new Nokia 8 is a big risk for this new company .. There’s always a balance needed with any new smartphone. How hard do you push in terms of innovation? How much do you invest in terms of new designs? Do you go for a safe and comfortable experience or do you risk something new that may not work? Given HMD Global’s corporate background, the Nokia 8 cannot afford to take too many risks.. HMD Global's Nokia 8 (image: Ewan Spence). The first impression of the Nokia 8 is the physical design. Where the first wave of HMD handsets looked to be more boxlike and angular, the Nokia 8 picks up many of the design cues that are familiar from 2017’s leading handsets. That means a gentle curve across the back of the handset that is far more comfortable in the hand than the Nokia 6. The sides of the Nokia handset continues the curve up to meet the front of the handset, providing a lot of surface area for fingers and thumbs to grip. The Nokia 8 feels very secure in my hand.. Also familiar from the 2017 design book is the radio transparent material need for the cellular, bluetooth and Wi-Fi antennas. These can be seen along the top and bottom edges. On my ‘steel’ toned machine the color matching isn’t perfect so these do appear to stand out a little more compared to other palettes. When you are in flagship territory it can be the small details like the color gradients that can impact the purchasing the decision.. HMD Global's Nokia 8 (image: Ewan Spence). Although the Nokia 8 has a modern curved feeling on the rear, the main display and front fascia feels less ambitious. There’s a tiny bit of sculpting at the edge of the glass so there’s a smooth transition to the curved edge of the handset, but the screen is resolutely flat with no curved edges or fancy designs. The QHD 2K resolution screen is a comfortable 5.3 inches on the diagonal, giving it a large but not excessive feel. There is a significant amount of bezel on display at the top and bottom the screen.. On the positive side that leaves space for a fingerprint sensor under the physical home key, along with the standard Android navigation controls either side of the home button under capacitive buttons outside of the screen real estate. It also leaves a lot of room for the cameras, so the forward and rear facing cameras can use the full depth of the device.. HMD Global's Nokia 8 (image: Ewan Spence). Specifications wise the Nokia 8 delivers the high-end numbers that are expected from a late 2017 flagship. It comes with Qualcomm’s SnapDragon 835 and my review model has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. It has microSD card support to expand the storage, and everything motors along nicely. Switching between apps is smooth, and the focus placed on heat dissipation means that you’ll need to be doing some serious gaming or streaming before the Nokia 8 warms up in your hand. The heat is dissipated over as much of the surface as possible, so rather than hot spots there’s a general raised level of warmth that is not uncomfortable.. With a 3090 mAh battery the Nokia 8 is a little bit down on capacity compared to higher priced devices, so the modern smartphone target of aiming for a full day of work with a bit left over for the following day is achievable with careful use of apps (i.e. avoid playing your complicated 3D games if you need to get to 5pm). If you assume you’ll get a full day of use and you’ll be charging the device overnight you’ll be fine. It’s worth noting that the Nokia 8 does support QuickCharge 3.0 through the USB-C port, so topping it up at the office will not take long if you have thirty minutes to push some power in.. HMD Global's Nokia 8 (image: Ewan Spence). For all of the Finnish design and heritage of the name, the Nokia 8 design brings in many modern touches but just feels like it falls short of excellence. There’s nothing wrong with the choices made, and there are logical reasons behind each of them, but the overall effect is a handset that is more focused on function than fashion. As you’ll see, that’s an ethos that runs through all of the Nokia 8 and HMD Global’s other handsets.. HMD Global's Nokia 8 (image: Ewan Spence). That’s not the only echo of the old Nokia. HMD has revived the tradition of the awkwardly named feature trying to be hip. Presumably, the thinking went something like this… If you are taking a picture or video of yourself, that’s called a selfie… therefore if you are taking a video of two people using both cameras at the same time is a bothie.. Yes, it’s a cute feature on the phone, and yes it helps it stand out from the crowd, but I think it stands out now for all the wrong reasons. It sounds clunky, forced, and I’d argue is HMD Global’s first self-induced mis-step.. There is a use case for this feature, but it feels a pretty small one. Streaming two sides of a conversation, when both people are in the same room, and sending it to the likes of Facebook… that’s a pretty small group in relation to the prominence it was offered in the launch materials. It probably speaks more to the lack of genuine innovation in the entire smartphone world that the bothie was given a leading role.. HMD Global's Nokia 8 (image: Ewan Spence). Perhaps more importantly for media capture on the Nokia 8 is the dual lens camera to the rear. The first lens is a 13-megapixel camera with optical image stabilization. The second camera is also 13 megapixels, but is a monochrome camera and lacks the stabilization. This approach to dual lens allows for more information to be captured in an image, better low light capability and increased contrast. The artistic effects such as panoramic images and the bokeh style portrait effects are hiding in a submenu, along with manual controls so professionals can access increased fidelity.. The forward facing camera is also 13. megapixels, and matches the specifications of the rear color camera (without the stabilization though), again putting the emphasis on image quality.. HMD Global's Nokia 8 (image: Ewan Spence). Low-level quality is above average but perhaps loses out very slightly to the likes of the Galaxy S8 and OnePlus 5 - much of this will be down to how the software combines the images from the two lenses at the rear so it’s going to be worth watching is there is any improvements in the quality of night-time images as software is updated through the life of the handset.. In use the Nokia 8 delivers the picture quality that you would expect from a flagship handset. Images are crisp, color reproduction is more natural than the over-saturated preferences of some handsets, and I’ve no real complaints about the resulting photos and videos.. HMD Global's Nokia 8 (image: Ewan Spence). HMD Global has put a lot of effort into the message that the company is relying on ‘pure Android’ and Google’s stock version of the mobile operating system. The switched-on Android follower will recognize that stock Android does not have a ‘bothie’ mode or the options available to the camera. Therefore HMD Global is running a custom camera application as part of the package, as opposed to the out-of-the-box solution used by others. It’s an understandable (and required) move but it shows the limitations the rest of the Nokia 8’s software - there will be no surprises and there will be nothing challenging the expected norm.. What you get with the Nokia 8 is the Google-approved implementation of Android.. The Nokia 8 speaks to the power of branding. I think that a lot of people are going to be looking for a new smartphone and land on the word ‘Nokia’ and feel incredibly comfortable because of the association with the past. Given the slightly cheaper OnePlus 5 is a close match specification wise to the Nokia 8, the premium of the name should offer confidence. There’s also Nokia’s association with being a good value for money choice, which means in comparison to the higher priced Samsung Galaxy S8 the Nokia 8 will also look attractive.. The biggest success of this handset is not in the use of stock Android, the promise of regular security updates, in having a curiously unique video streaming feature or respectable imaging software. It’s the fact that the handset can be called “Nokia 8”, and not "HMD 8". The latter would struggle to get a foothold in the market or capture the world’s imagination. The former means that many will at least consider this device as a purchase.. The Nokia 8 is competent without being stunning. Is that still what the market wants? I can’t answer that yet. What I can say is that the Nokia 8 is reliable, unfussy, and gets the job done…but it’s leaning very heavily on the Nokia brand name to sell an ultimately unambitious handset..

At long last, Nokia delivers a modern Android smartphone in the form of the new Nokia 8. A single device that combines a credible name, impressive craftsmanship, enviable technical specifications and pure Android OS – just like on Pixels, but with a lower price – gives HMD Global the right to hope there is still time for Nokia to get back into the big league. If it is late, then the company is on the right track with this phone – which comes with a 5.3-inch QHD display, aluminum unibody, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 and 4 or 6 GB of RAM, a dual 13-mega pixel rear camera, a 13-mega pixel front camera with Zeiss lenses and a 3090 mAh battery.. It is nostalgically classic on one hand and it provides a supreme premium feel on the other – this characterizes Nokia 8’s craftsmanship and anyone will conclude the same when they first get their hands on this device. The series 6000 aluminum unibody (most powerful aluminum toughness standard on smartphones is 7000) secures the impression that the phone features above-average build quality. Being just 7.9 mm (0.31 in) thick, weighing 160 grams, with slightly rounded edges in the back and considerably rounded edges in the front, the Nokia 8 is ergonomic and robust at the same time. It feels comfortable and safe when held in any sized hand. It is perfectly clear that Nokia engineers put a great deal of effort into the construction of this phone, as is expected from such a respectable logo.. Even from the inside, the Nokia 8 offers equally impressive engineering, thus it comes with a unique cooling system which is necessary for certain most demanding tasks which the processor supports, e.g. streaming dual videos – videos which were recorded with the front and back cameras at the same time. In order to avoid overheating in such cases, HMD chose a copper pipe that is connected to a graphite shield, which sends the heat throughout the whole chassis (and uses the whole chassis as a cooling device). Such a passive cooling system protects the phone’s hardware platform from entering the ‘red zone’ when it comes to heat and enables the processor power to be used in its full capacity.. Furthermore, the placement of plastic slits for the signal of various antennas is rather interesting. Constructors covered the entire upper and bottom sides of the phone with these slits, just like its edges, making it fall-proof. The contact between the plastic and the metal materials in the back, i.e. metal and glass in the front cannot be felt under the fingers – not even if you carefully move your fingernail from one material to another. Many users will not even notice there is a transition in the materials. The phone’s form factor is ‘the old one’, meaning it comes in a baseless version and an extended display, which might be a problem for users who prefer the latest market trends. It is 151 mm (5.96 in) tall and 74 mm (2.90 in) wide. In a similar fashion, it comes with ‘just’ the IP57 certificate, therefore it is not fully waterproof, but resistant to sprinkling.. There is a Home key with an always-on fingerprint reader in the front of the phone, below the display, and it is possible to activate the device from stand-by mode by pressing this key too, while the Back and Tasks capacitive keys with background lighting are located to its left and right. This means that they do not take away any space at the bottom of the user interface and are always available. The speaker sits above the screen, along with the front-facing camera lens and several sensors.. The back surface includes a bulge holding the rear-camera lenses, LED flash, focus sensor and a tiny perforation for the ambiance microphone. The phone’s upper side holds the 3.5-mm audio jack, while the bottom one includes the USB Type-C connector, primary microphone and speaker perforations. The Power key is located on the right side, at thumb height, while the volume rocker sits above it. The left side includes the hybrid slot for the nano-SIM card and the microSD cards, which can be replaced with another nano-SIM card.. This device also boasts an above average 5.3-inch QHD (1440 x 2560 pixels) IPS LCD display. Its relatively compact surface area for a flagship phone is the only objection I have, as the competition has made users used to much bigger displays. The same thing goes for the modest display-to-phone surface ratio, which is 69.4 percent. Every other feature is praiseworthy, and this is what determines imaging quality on the display. Exceptional sharpness comes from a 554 ppi pixel density and what is particularly thrilling is the screen’s contrast, especially when exposed to direct sunlight. Nokia 8 is surely the best IPS LCD phone around when it comes to this issue and matches the competition with AMOLED displays.. Deep black tones and light whites partly contribute to realistically and dynamically saturated colors and it should be pointed out that the phone comes with an always-on display. This means that the basic information the uses selects are displayed only when the phone is moved on a desk or taken out of the pocket – i.e. It is up to the user to choose whether this notification is the time, date, weather or other notifications.. The Nokia 8 comes with a very contemporary hardware platform based on Qualcomm’s octa-core Snapdragon 835 chipset (four Kyro cores running a 2.5 GHz clock and four Kyro cores running a 1.8 GHz clock) with Adreno 540 graphics. The 64 GB memory storage model comes with 4 GB of RAM, while the 128 GB model has 6 GB of RAM. With Android 7.1.1 (Nougat) which can be upgraded to Android 8.0 (Oreo) and is not weighed down by user interface modifications, the phone scores results on synthetic benchmarks which exceeds expectations. To be precise, Nokia 8 offers a touch better results than Samsung’s Galaxy S8 on both Geekbench tests – when one core is used and when multiple cores are tested. Of course, this cannot be evident as an important advantage in the first weeks of use, but it guarantees that the phone would provide fluidity over a rather long period of active use.. The preinstalled Android OS can indeed be called ‘pure’, although not everything is identical to what you’ll find on the Google Pixel, for instance. The camera app is different, which includes certain functionalities that are exclusively available on this phone and which is somewhat more intuitive and faster than the Google version, even when only the standard camera functions are used. The other difference is purely cosmetic: the icons of basic apps which are locked in the bottom row on the Home screen have blue tones, making them difficult to tell apart at first.. The battery has 3090 mAh, which does not seem like much on paper when top-range is concerned. Still, the display is not too big, the chipset is up-to-date and the mentioned cooling system all ensure greater autonomy for this phone during everyday work than it initially meets the eye. With average phone use, it will last a day and a half without the need to recharge, while more intense use will still enable you not to think about recharging from early morning until bedtime. Quick Charge 3.0 standard enables speedy charging, as the battery hits 48 percent is 30 minutes.. All three cameras – two rear-facing and one forward-facing – have 13 mega pixels and Zeiss lenses. One of the rear cameras is in color, while the second one is monochromatic (the first one has optical stabilization). Huawei has a similar set-up on its top models, with Leica as the lens creator, but the difference is evident only is shades and particularities. Thus, Nokia 8 offers above average photographs with a great dynamic range. Imprecise automatic focus system is an issue, as it tends to be confused at night, making the camera slow to lock on a shot. Still, once the image is taken well, even at night, it has the kind of quality Nokia got us used to back in the time when HMD Global did not stand behind the brand.. A particularity regarding Nokia 8 is a rarely seen option called Live Bokeh – the user can chose to apply this popular effect or not even when the dual camera is used. The phone also supports the unique Dual Sight option, which shoots images and records vides with the front and back cameras at the same time, splitting the shot in two. What is more, such a video can directly be streamed on YouTube or Facebook, which is fun and different than the kind of live-streams we usually find on these services. To put it short, the cameras are creative and satisfactory, but Nokia should work on an advanced automatic focus system.. If seen as a product from a new market player – the Nokia 8 is an impressive phone. This model especially deserves it due in no small part to the robust finish, but the display contrast is equally impressive, not to mention the chipset’s supreme performance. The massive screen bezels and the fact that the camera has been technically touched up leave room for improvement, but the manufacturer surely compensated for these drawbacks with yet another significant deal maker – unburdened and easily upgradeable Android OS. Nokia positioned itself to return to its former glory as one of the world’s most significant phone manufacturers, but it is hard not to notice that the chances for this would have been greater had the company taken this route a bit sooner..

The smartphone features three incredible 13MP lenses and a super bright 5.3-inch Quad HD display.". Available 64GB (4GB RAM) & 128GB (6GB RAM) internal storage. Available in matte blue, glossy blue, copper and silver steel. “For a perfect all-round Android experience, the Nokia 8 is well worth a look. The dual 13MP camera will provide top quality photos, and the slim-line design feels great.”. The 5.3-inch Quad HD display guarantees everything on-screen will be crystal-clear. Use both the rear and front-facing cameras at the same time with Dual-Sight mode to always have everyone in the frame. Make sure all your stuff is protected with the on-board fingerprint sensor inside the home button. Find out more about the Nokia 8’s build. The Nokia 8 is crafted from a single piece of precision-crafted aluminium, which wraps around the sides of the phone from the rear. It’s also super-slim at just 7.9mm - looking and feeling great.. The large Quad HD display with 2.5D curved Gorilla Glass 5 not only looks great, but it’s really strong too. It measures 5.3-inches from corner to corner, and delivers a really high quality picture.. The rear camera is made up of two 13MP lenses, giving you loads of creative options. You can use both lenses at the same time with live bokeh effect, blurring the background for a sharp professional look. Or, you can use them independently for detailed monotone shots.. Nokia’s branded its Dual-Sight mode ‘bothie’, which lets you use the 13MP front-facing lens at the same time as the rear 13MP camera.

Nokia 8 Reviews - page 2. Rated 5 out of. Running Oreo 8.1.0 and the phone is simply great to use. I'm a heavy user with multiple accounts syncing constantly. Emails being sent every minuet is so for work and pleasure. Off charge at 06:00, now 13:00 and I've still got 75% battery left. Oreo seems to be vast improvement to what I last used before jumping to Apple a few years ago. Nokia has returned with a superb device that ticks all the boxes I'd expect.. Rated 4 out of. Nice to see Nokia back in the game. Decided it was time to upgrade from my faithful Lumia 930 after many years of impeccable service (a slow degrade in battery life and of course zero support) and bar a Motorola Razr and two Samsungs (S3 and S4 and dumped them owing to the horrendous bloatware) I've always had Nokias, so I was pleased to see the launch of new Nokia models. Very simple to get back in the Android groove, fingerprint was a bit fiddly to do but I can see it has its uses! One niggling issue was not being able to delete pics immediately and having to take a rather long route to the SD card as Google Photos says access is denied from the camera, but no doubt there's a way round this.. No problems with speed, no lagging, app use etc although I'm not a heavy app user. Accessing email etc is quick and easy. No problems pairing with headphones, in car entertainment and other stuff. Battery life is astonishing, fast charge is a must these days.. Camera doesn't seem as good as the 930 but as yet not had a chance to test it thoroughly so for now only 3 stars.. However I'm on my second one, as the first developed a strange fault after charging where the screen divided itself neatly in half with a strange purple/blue pixellated effect and refused to turn off although I could just about access the screen for entering the PIN. Took it back to my local CW who said it was more than definitely faulty and I had a new one arrive the day after. So far so good although slightly paranoid about charging it..... Overall though, it's a great phone - no doubt Nokia will improve on these models over the coming years but for now, definitely welcome back Nokia!. Rated 5 out of. Very good ..specially camera.İ Like Nokia 8 forever. Rated 1 out of. I bought this phone in September 2017, pretty much as soon as it was launched. I loved it when i took it out of the packaging. Over the first 3 months i have had many problems. It constantly crashes despite restarting it daily. I have now got a crackle coming from the speaker. Its safe to say i wont be buying a nokia again in the future. If you find cheper deal than ours,We'll match it and pay your first monthly bill..

Nokia 8 Specifications Review and Price In India. Nokia 8 is a soon to released camera-centric smartphone by the erstwhile giant and the recently resurrected Nokia. With claims of 'capturing the perfect shot', the phone is a supposed bid by the company to rope in the photography lovers. Coming to specifications, the phone is expected to sport a 5.7-inch 2K AMOLED display with a 1440x2560p resolution and boot the latest Android OS - Nougat 7.0 - out of the box. Other than that, the high-end Nokia 8 will feature a 6GB RAM and would feature an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor at that. Also, the phone is deemed to be available in two storage variants (64GB and 128GB), which you can further stretch to a maximum of 256GB by making use of a microSD card. Talking about the optics, the Nokia 8 will feature a mammoth 24MP camera on its back featuring a Carl Zeiss lens alongside an HRM sensor, replete with features like OIS, dual-tone LED and f/1.8 aperture. Up front, there is a 12MP selfie snapper. The Nokia 8 is a part of the roster of four Nokia phones that are set to be unveiled at the upcoming MWC and the Nokia 8 best price in India is expected to be around 41,999INR. You can subscribe to Smartprix to get news, alerts and notifications related to the Nokia 8.. High Quality Cameras Fingerprint sensor Good Storage Capacity. The flagship Nokia 8 is well-armed with the top-of-the-line Snapdragon 835, an impressive high-res LCD, premium aluminum unibody and the latest Android OS.The cameraphone Nokia 8 had no other choice perhaps than have its own take on the dual-camera outfit with two 13MP sensors, an optically-stabilized color one and a monochrome one. The Nokia 8 is powered by a 3,090 mAh battery a rather average capacity for a flagship. The phone supports Quick Charging 3.0 technology and comes with a 18W charger in the retail box.. Battery capacity seems low Not fully water-proof No 1080p@60fps video recording. It is a phone which is damn powerful and intelligent. Qualcomm's latest flagship processor is at the heart of its experience coupled with 4GB RAM (yes, that's more than enough), 64GB storage, dual SIM and LTE to top things off. It works brilliantly even in bright sunlight and generally with its qHD resolution and Corning Gorilla Glass it is a joy to use for playing games, typing mails, reading or watching YouTube. The display could also use some more brilliance. Perhaps an OLED panel would have added to that.. The Nokia 8 offers a lot of great features such as a powerful chipset, dual-sensor camera and a perfectly sized QHD display, but compared to a lot of the competition right now it struggles to offer anything unique. With a super-high price point, the Nokia 8 is a good phone but far from a great one. The camera has been made in partnership with Zeiss too, although it’s not entirely clear what input the German lens specialists have had.. Beautiful design, especially with shiny effect Dual-sensor rear camera with interesting software Gorgeous QHD display. No hugely unique features It's not waterproof Price is a touch higher than we'd hoped. The Nokia 8 is in many ways a boring phone. It does not have any flashy features, and its bothie camera mode is a gimmick. It lacks personality, it’s just another Android phone. But to most people looking to upgrade from an older phone, the Nokia 8 is much more than that: it’s a great value offer when you compare it with other flagships, and you can buy two Nokia 8 phones for the price of one Galaxy Note 8. And the Nokia 8 excels in daily use with smooth performance throughout.. Great price Smooth performance Plentiful 64GB of internal storage Fast charger included in the box Solid battery life. Big bezels, colors not as lively as on other screens Camera is below average No water proofing Fingerprint is not as accurate as on other phones Always-on Display is hard to see, too dim. 5.3 inches compact Gorilla glass Quad hd display Build quality Flagships processor snap dragon 835 Updates comes fast. No super amoled And hybrid slot is big con. Excellent mobile in this price range. Best Nokia mobile is Nokia 8. Hybrid sim slot No super amoled screen. I used it it is very faster and smooth performance that never feel you bore whenever. Super camera quality Smooth and faster performance Storage is good Screen quality is awesom Fingerprint works well Super fine build quality. Battery should be better Should be 60fps quality to be greatest. this is what every one want from Nokia. only negativity is all smartphone brand are going to down soon(as per price group).. Octa Core & 2.45 GHz Processor 6 GB RAM 128 GB inbuilt 24 MP Rear + 12 MP Front Camera(Father of Cameras) Gorilla Glass 5 Fingerprint Sensor Dolby+ Dual speaker. Faster processor more RAM high-end cameras bigger screen crispy and higher resolution screen lots of storage capacity. Enter each Pro in new line.. Enter each Con in new line..

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. The Nokia 6 was announced at the end of CES this month to the delight of many in the smartphone world - the Finnish name has been absent for a long time - but that handset may not have been the only Android-powered Nokia handset on display in Las Vegas.. on a handset reminiscent of the new Nokia 6 with design echoes of previous Nokia handsets. It was being used by Qualcomm to demonstrate the power of the latest SnapDragon 835 system-on-chip to perform image stabilisation compared to the previous generation SnapDragon 821.. Is this the Nokia Flagship from HMD that will be announced at Mobile World Congress next month? Let's look at the evidence .. First of all, the physical shape of the device matches that of the Nokia 6. When it was launched HMD's announcement leaned heavily on the design that was fashioned from a single block of metal for a luxury feel. The addition of physical buttons suggest a model higher up the portfolio.. Although there are no markings or branding images visible on the device, there is one signature element from older Nokia handsets. The camera on the rear of the machine with its distinctive round housing and raised bulge from the back of the machine echoes the Nokia Lumia 1020 PureView.. As for the name, 'Nokia P1' has been bandied around for some time, but I suspect that's more likely to be shorthand for 'Prototype Design 1'. To make a family of devices you would start with the high-end device and then degrade the specifications and design as you move down the portfolio towards the lower price points.. We already know the Nokia 6 is out there - going with Nokia 8 will evoke memories of previous Nokia smartphones where the high-end devices would generally include the number 8 (such as the Nokia N81, the N8, the N800, and the Lumia 800) with the 6 being used for mid-range devices. The 9 was generally kept for the communicator series of devices - a device that would surely have limited appeal but talismanic powers for those faithful to Finland.. Nokia 6 (image: HMD Global PR). The presumptively titled Nokia 8 is expected to ship with two variants - a premium model with a SnapDragon 835, 6 GB of RAM, 64 GB or 128 GB of storage, microSD card support and a 24 megapixel camera with electronic and optical image stabilisation. The lesser model would be the second device in Qualcomm's shaky rig with a SnapDragon 821, 4 GB of RAM and a smaller camera.. Details are expected to be announced at the HMD / Nokia Mobile event on Sunday February 26th in Barcelona , the night before Mobile World Congress opens..

In the nine months of HMD Global’s existence, it has released nine smartphones under the Nokia brand name. Fans waiting for a Nokia flagship phone, however, have been disappointed — until now. This is the Nokia 8 : a high-spec, camera-centric Android smartphone that should do the much-loved brand name proud. HMD Global is the driving force behind new Nokia, as it has struck a licensing agreement to use the iconic brand name for its smartphones. But its success comes from some well-chosen and carefully cultivated partnerships with companies such as Google, Qualcomm , and now Zeiss .. Nokia’s name has always been synonymous with camera phones, with Zeiss often providing the lenses. Now the two are working together again. While this is great news, as Zeiss optics are highly respected, it’s not the main reason to be excited about the Nokia 8’s camera.. No, you need to be excited about the Bothie. It’s a bit of a buzzword name, but don’t let that detract from its promise. This is a camera feature that has been well thought out, pushing the hardware to the max, and we think it could inspire plenty of creativity among video creators.. Bothie refers to the Nokia 8’s ability to take a picture with both the front and the rear camera at the same time, and display the results next to each other in a single image. Both images are taken at 13 megapixels, and both have autofocus, so the quality is the same for each.. Fans waiting for a Nokia flagship phone have been disappointed — until now.. Questioning who would use this? You’re not alone. HMD Global’s product marketing lead Katerina Karellas, who spent the last eight months perfecting the feature, told Digital Trends there was some resistance to the concept at first. But once the team was on board, they went all-out to get it exactly right.. This actually resulted in the phone’s development taking longer than planned, so the Bothie feature operated at its best. The two cameras caused overheating issues at first, but with Qualcomm’s help and the addition of a copper cooling pipe inside the phone’s body, this problem was ultimately solved.. It will appeal to anyone who loves live streaming, reaction videos, and selfies. It’s two photos in one, and can combine a reaction to an event or surroundings. This is the essence of the selfie. How many are of people smiling in front of a landmark, for example? It’s great to see a fun twist on an old classic.. The Nokia 8’s two rear lenses shoot in color and monochrome, and by default, combine the two for a higher quality image. The camera interface is very simple, illustrated with icons that make functionality immediately obvious.. You need to be excited about the Bothie.. Best of all, there are built-in Facebook Live and YouTube Live functions in the camera app. Going “live” is only a few taps away, and broadcasting in Bothie mode is simple. Bothie is ideal for live broadcasts, negating the need for switching between cameras at different intervals.. We took sample Bothies, and some pictures in color, monochrome, and dual-lens mode with the Nokia 8. The results were great, especially in monochrome, which remains a favorite camera feature of ours. Nokia’s camera interface makes everything easy. This continues through the operating system, where only small changes have been made to pure Android 7.1.1 by Nokia, all with Google’s assistance.. If you’re anything like us, you’ll covet the polished copper version seen in some of our pictures. It’s beautiful in real life, with an eye-catching gleam and a high-gloss finish. In-hand comfort is also supreme, with perfectly rounded side panels blending into the 2.5D curved glass over the 5.3-inch screen. Although the screen isn’t large, the phone itself feels quite sizeable, mainly because we’ve become more used to bezel-less designs from Samsung. Beyond the bells and whistles, we were pleased to see that the flagship specifications are all there to match the Nokia 8’s competitors. The 5.3-inch screen has a 2,560 x 1,440-pixel resolution; the phone is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835; there’s 4GB of RAM; and 64GB of base internal storage (plus a MicroSD card slot if you need more space). You’ll find improved range with Bluetooth 5, Gorilla Glass 5 screen protection, and a 3,090mAh battery keeping it all alive.. It’s beautiful in real life, with an eye-catching gleam, and a high-gloss finish.. Bothies aren’t going to be for everyone. There’s no doubt such a function will appeal to a particular type of person, but as live streaming becomes more mainstream, more people will look for ways to have fun with friends and show off their exploits. The Bothie has arrived on the cusp of that movement, and Nokia’s implementation of the dual-image is slick enough for it to really capitalize on it.. Outside of the Bothie, the Nokia 8 doesn’t shout about its speed, ability, classy style, or simplicity of use; but don’t take that to mean it’s not extremely capable. In our short time with the phone, it impressed us. However, if the Bothie isn’t for you, then you may find the phone a little too shy-and-retiring, due to the unwillingness to shout about how good it is.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

Nokia 8 Nokia 8 review: Nokia’s top-tier flagship brings the firm back on track. facebook twitter google+ email Comments. Nokia’s revival is a long time coming and packed with smartphones, and the Nokia 8 leads the pack. Nokia 8 review: What you need to know Nokia 8 review: Price and competition Nokia 8 review: Design and key features Nokia 8 review: Camera Nokia 8 review: Performance and battery life Nokia 8 review: Verdict. After a brief hiatus, Nokia has returned to the world of smartphones. So far, however, its planned resurgence hasn’t gone off with a bang so much as a faint whimper, and the phones we’ve been treated to – for lack of a better word – have failed to recapture the firm’s past glories. Now that the firm’s first proper flagship phone, the Nokia 8 , has finally landed, the question is whether this is the handset that can turn the company’s fortunes around. Going by what I’ve seen so far, the answer may well be yes.. READ NEXT: The best smartphones of 2017. Nokia has already launched a handful of phones this year, but the Nokia 8 is its premium flagship handset. Equipped with a 5.3in, 2,560 x 1,440 display, 4GB of RAM and the latest Snapdragon 835 processor, this is a top-tier handset, with a suitably high price point. Expect stock Android Nougat right out of the box, with Android O making an appearance sometime in the near future.. At £500, the Nokia 8’s price is very much what you’d expect from a flagship device. You might think it a little steep – especially considering that the Nokia 6 , one step down, costs just £200. But don’t let that fool you: the Nokia 8 is a flagship in every respect, and you’re getting a top-tier phone with your hard-earned cash.. At this price, though, the Nokia 8 faces stiff competition. There’s the Samsung Galaxy S8 to contend with – which has just dropped below £600 – and the Google Pixel range starts at £600 , too. If you’re willing to forgo Android, there’s also the iPhone 7 family to consider, which works its way up from a starting price of £600 .. The first thing you’ll spot is the 5.3in, 2,560 x 1,440 display on the front. That resolution amounts to a pixel-perfect density of 554ppi, and Nokia has wisely opted to protect it with a sheet of Gorilla Glass 5. It’s a tad disappointing to note that the Nokia 8 lacks the snazzy edge-to-edge displays of the Galaxy S8 and LG G6 , but it’s a decent screen nonetheless. It’s bright and clear, and exactly what we’d expect to find on a flagship phone.. So bright in fact, that the Nokia 8 is positively dazzling. A max brightness of 663cd/m2 is more than suitable for even the brightest Summer days, and you'll never have to squint at your phone again. As for colour accuracy, the Nokia 8 perfectly poised in that department, too. An sRGB colour gamut coverage of 98.5%, as measured by our X-Rite colour calibrator, rivals even the likes of Samsung's AMOLED displays, and an average Delta E of 3.28 points at a display that's well worth your time. Given this is a 2K display too, you'll be perfectly suited for watching Netflix shows on the go.. Nokia has really pushed the boat out when it comes to design, though. While its other handsets have failed to inspire, Nokia has drawn on the design cues of the iconic Lumia handsets to create something pretty special. The 8 is wonderfully slim, measuring a dainty 7.3mm thick, and as it’s crafted from just a single block of aluminium, it both looks and feels like an absolute stunner.. Nokia 3 review: Is this the budget Android phone to beat?. Nokia 6 review: Hands-on with Nokia’s comeback. Everyone loves a nicely chamfered edge, and these are quite plainly some of the finest chamfers you’ll encounter on a smartphone. It doesn’t just look good, though: the curved sides ensure that the handset sits snugly in the hand, and make it easy to use the fingerprint reader without adjusting your grip or shuffling the phone about in your palm.. It’s the camera which really sets the 8 apart from the crowd. Out back, you’ll find a Zeiss-branded dual-camera setup, with one being a monochrome f/2.0 13-megapixel sensor, and the other incorporating a 13-megapixel bog-standard RGB sensor. The two work in tandem, with the monochrome sensor capturing detail and the RGB sensor capturing colour. This is a technique used by several other recent flagships from rival manufacturers, but the end result is an image with oodles of detail and bright, punchy colours.. One particularly intriguing new feature is what Nokia is calling a “bothie”: the ability to take pictures with both the front and rear cameras simultaneously. Press the shutter button and both shots are squeezed into a single frame, with a snap of your reaction on one side, and the view you’re gawking at on the other. It’s a neat little addition, and a feature that is perfectly suited for Facebook and YouTube live streams.. The Nokia 8 has the kind of horsepower you’d expect for a modern flagship. There’s Qualcomm’s latest octa-core processor on board – the Snapdragon 835 – and this is partnered with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage (expandable up to 256GB via microSD). That’s a reliable recipe for high-end performance, no question about it.. Running Geekbench 4, the Nokia 8 reached 1,930 in the single core test, and a blisteringly quick 6,540 in multi-core. Stacking it up against 2017's other big-hitters, this result puts the Nokia 8 firmly among them, with near-identical scores to the Galaxy S8, Xperia XZ Premium and iPhone7.. As for gaming performance, it isn't quite the same story. An average 35fps in the GFXBench Manhattan 3.0 on-screen test is by no means abysmal, but when put side-by-side with other Snapdragon 835-equipped handsets, the Nokia 8 starts to fall a little flat. The culprit? Its 2K display, for certain. Take a look at the chart below, and you'll see what I mean.. Nokia also talked up the Nokia 8’s “advanced heat management solution” at its launch. In short, a liquid-cooled copper pipe runs across the length of the Nokia 8, with graphite shielding dispersing heat from the Snapdragon chipset throughout the metal shell. This all sounds very impressive, and Nokia says it’s the perfect way to keep heat levels to a minimum, and thus – potentially – extend battery life.. In fact, battery life is the 8's raison d'être. The fancy thermal tech inside seems to have done its job, with the Nokia 8 reaching a total of 18hrs 46mins on a single charge during our continuous video playback test with the screen set to our standard 170cd/m2 brightness. For comparison sake, the Nokia 8's 3,050mAh battery is longer-lasting than the Galaxy S8, XZ Premium and iPhone 7, but falters when put head-to-head with the OnePlus 5.. Everything is all above board, but the burning question is whether there’s still room for Nokia in 2017. Before now, I’d have argued not, and especially so given the firm’s recent track record with middling handsets like the Nokia 3. But it looks like the Nokia 8 may just put the Finnish firm back on course – there’s every chance that this smartphone will see Nokia grabbing headlines for all the right reasons come September time.. It certainly helps that Nokia has opted to build a more traditional flagship rather than pushing niche, high-end features – case in point, it isn’t asking for absurd amounts of cash like Asus with its £800 Zenfone AR. Granted, the Nokia 8 might not be as flamboyant as key rivals such as Samsung’s stunning Galaxy S8, but with bang up-to-date internals, a lengthy battery life, and a design that befits its asking price, the Nokia 8 is a confident stride in the right direction..

I was one of those buyers that never fully utilised the potential of their phones and just bought any old cheap crap phone. That's until I got an iPhone and then moved.... Yeah, not worth it if you are going for a daily driver. I would like to have N8 as companion to 808 but didn't get chance yet. It's a good collector item with great 12MP shooter. I'am stuck with Android too and waiting for Nokia to revive Meego.. To bad that Symbian and Meego is ded. They should be making them better so us, the user have more choice in terms of OS. If Nokia makes a divices like dis again I will give a try, until then I will stay with my Sony..
