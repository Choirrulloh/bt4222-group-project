Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual SIM Review: Off to a Shaky Start. Ershad Kaleebullah , 19 December 2014. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual SIM in pictures. The Lumia 535 Dual SIM is an important phone for Microsoft, as its first Windows Phone that has been announced globally sans the iconic Nokia branding. Will the first Microsoft Lumia phone manage to uphold the legacy of Nokia's great designs, build quality, performance and cameras? We investigate all this and more in our full review of the Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual SIM.. Look and feel Not much is new in the design department, as the Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual SIM carries forward the same trend of colourful plastic rear shells that we are accustomed to seeing with Lumia phones. However, the build quality leaves a lot to be desired. We were thoroughly unimpressed with the rear shell flexing when pressed, and the popping sound it makes because it doesn't fit very well. This makes us believe that the plastic used for the rear shell is not of a very high quality. Our glossy orange review unit was too bright for our liking. The phone is also available in cyan, bright green, white and black.. The phone has dimensions of 140.2x72.4x8.8mm and weighs 146g. Despite its fairly large body, Microsoft has fitted a 5-inch screen. As a result, there are thick bezels around the screen and the phone is wider than most other 5-inch phones these days. Gripping it might be a problem for people with small hands.. Microsoft uses on-screen buttons for navigation. Above the screen lie the front camera and the earpiece. There is a tiny speaker grille at the bottom on the rear. The primary camera is on a slight bump on the rear. The Micro-USB port is on the bottom of the phone whereas the 3.5mm audio jack sits on the top. The power button and volume rocker are on the right edge of the phone and they have great tactile feedback. Beneath the rear shell one can find the battery compartment, two slots forMicro-SIM cards, and the microSD card slot.. Specifications and software The Lumia 535 Dual SIM rocks a Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 quad-core SoC clocked at 1.2GHz. It also has 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage which can be expanded by up to 128GB using a microSD card.. The phone has 5-megapixel cameras on both the rear and the front. The primary camera on the rear has a 1/4-inch sensor and a flash. The front camera on the other hand has the same 24mm wide angle lens as its elder sibling, the Lumia 730 Dual SIM. On the connectivity front, the phone supports 3G, Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0. It has a relatively small 1,905mAh battery.. The 5-inch IPS LCD screen has a resolution of 540x960 (qHD) which translates to a pixel density of approximately 220ppi. While this screen is much better than the one on the Lumia 530 Dual SIM which had a resolution of 480x800, it still doesn't cut it compared to other phones in the same price range which have much better 720p panels. We could see pixellation in text. Everything looked dull, and when viewed at an angle we noticed discolouration. The screen is adequately legible under direct sunlight, though.. The Lumia 535 Dual SIM runs Windows Phone 8.1 with the latest Denim update, which adds a ton of Lumia camera features. All the other usual features of Windows Phone 8.1 are present here as well. We are growing to like this operating system despite its barren app store. Microsoft preloads a few quality third-party apps such as Hike, Jabong, BoxTV, Flipkart eBooks, FoodPanda, TimesCity, Twitter and Facebook. Thankfully, you can uninstall them if you wish to.. Camera The Denim update adds a tonne of self-branded camera apps: Lumia Camera, Lumia Cinemagraph, Lumia Creative Studio, Lumia Selfie and Lumia Storyteller. We repeat what we stated in our review of the Lumia 730 Dual SIM: all this borders on overkill, but some users might actually find them all useful. Lumia Camera works well for most purposes and offers loads of manual settings.. (Click for full size) The 5-megapixel primary camera captures decent details in favourable lighting conditions. We did notice a pinkish hue in some images but happened too rarely to be a major cause of concern. The camera handled the contrast between shadows and light accurately. In low-light situations, the camera did a decent job of letting in adequate light, but failed to manage noise. The 854x480 resolution video captured by the camera is devoid of detail and not what we expected from a camera of a Lumia smartphone. That said, Microsoft had to cut corners somewhere.. (Click for full size) The 5-megapixel front camera, on the other hand, is an absolute revelation. It is as good as the one on the Lumia 730 Dual SIM and we strongly believe that you cannot get a better camera in this price range. The selfies we captured had a great amount of detail and depth. The 24mm wide angle also helps.. Performance One thing that annoyed us to no end was the poor response of the touchscreen. Every single tap and swipe took some time to be recognised. This problem was aggravated when we tried multi-touch gestures such as zooming in to a photograph. This is completely unlike what we've come to expect from the Lumia series of phones. Thankfully, Microsoft has acknowledged this issue and has a software update in the works which will purportedly fix it.. We ran a few benchmarks and the Snapdragon 200's performance was close to the performance of the Snapdragon 400 in both, the Lumia 730 Dual SIM and the Lumia 830. This phone scored 11,676 points in AnTuTu and 246.26 in WPBench. For some reason, GFXBench failed to work. We tried Asphalt 8 and the gameplay was marred by lags.. The default video player doesn't recognise 1080p videos butour 720p test files worked just fine. The speaker is tinny but loud. The quality of the bundled headphones is decent but they get uncomfortable to wear after a while. As is typical of all Lumia phones, the sound quality in calls is excellent. The battery lasted 9 hours and 25 minutes in our video loop test, which is great. You can expect to squeeze at least a day and half's worth of moderate usage from the Lumia 535 Dual SIM.. Verdict Microsoft's first Lumia smartphone is a bit of a mixed bag. It has small flaws in basic areas such as the plastic quality and the touchscreen experience. This doesn't bode well for the future of a range of phones that has always been known for stellar construction quality.. Moreover, the price tag of Rs. 9,199 is on the high side considering phones like the Motorola Moto E ( Review | Pictures ), Micromax Unite 2 ( Review | Pictures ), Xiaomi Redmi Note ( Review | Pictures ), Xiaomi Redmi 1S ( Review | Pictures ) and Asus ZenFone 5 ( Review | Pictures ) all perform better than the Lumia 535 Dual SIM.. One department where the Microsoft phone beats the pants off its competition is the camera performance. However, even if that convinces you, it would be a good idea to wait until the touchscreen issues are sorted out..

Katharine Byrne from Expert Reviews wrote that "Microsoft's Lumia 535 is well-built, but poor battery life and a fussy touchscreen makes it frustrating to use." [6]. Since the release, users have detected numerous problems regarding the phone's touch screen.

Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual SIM Reviews. Lumia 535 Dual SIM is a Micro Dual SIM, comes with the latest version of Windows Phone, 5inch(540 x 960) of display, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7 of processor.. Please feel free to post your review on this product.. Better than android, luge ka lang sa apps dahil may app sa android na hindi supported ng windows phone. Ang issue lan dito is yung touch sensitivity nya is very high, hindi mo magagamit ng maayos yung phone kapag pawis or basa ang kamay mo pero may remedy para dito mag pakabit lang kayo ng tempered glass or matte screen protector in order to lessen of being responsive of the water in times na didikit sya sa screen. Tsaka may ilang updates na ang Microsoft para ma fux ang issue na to. Lastly yung battery, kailngan mobg mag charge ng 3 to 5 times sa isang araw, but it depends pa rin kung paano mo to gagamitin. kapag may konting moisture sa screen, either via pawis and whatnot, nagiging super sensitive yung touchscreen, so punas punas kapag may time.. other than that, it's a good phone, may cortana kasi windows 8.1.. not that bad windows phone actually, the only issue i noticed after purchasing the unit out of the box yesterday was the keyboard its kinda annoying sometimes i keep on pressing the letter the"N" but letter "B' is very insistent.. i suppose there are problems with their stock QWERTY keyboard i hope Microsoft will fix this issue.. before i forget the suggestive words keep on appearing on top of the text box I just cant afford seeing it every time I compose a message. If anybody from here knew how to deactivate this feature please feel free to reply this comment. and good luck to those who will be buying this budget windows phone... Overall the phone is just average. I love how the Windows phone intend to make their phones be as reliable as a windows desktop but the problem is this phone is lacking in power to handle the operating system. 1 GB of ram is not enough to fulfill the power this phone needs to run the perfect windows operating system. Also the touch responses and camera capture is slight slow compare to other phones available in the market. The design is just simple but my fingers are keep on touching the main camera which is not a good thing for the camera because it will take time before it becomes blurry. Overall, the phone was just average for my opinion.. Lab ko lang ang lumia kasi parang iPhone yung style nito mas mura pa sa iPhone, Naka flat lang kasi yung design nito at hindi pa madaling magasgas yung screen , matibay nga naman pag Nokia talaga, doon ako bilib sa phone na ito, pero hindi android , windows Os kaya mas fit saken kasi dito ko na ginagawa yung mga simpleng trabaho ko na dapat talaga sa desktop or laptop. pero sa tulong ng windows lumia phone ko solb problema , ko dual sim din, pero isa lang gamit ko kasi nag hahang pagdalawa naka insert eh..Okay na ako dito matibay pa battery nito...

Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual SIM specification User opinions and reviews Review comments (235). Microsoft Windows Dual SIM. Optional Dual SIM with dual standby model. 5" IPS display of qHD (540 x 960 px) resolution, Gorilla Glass 3. 1.2 GHz quad-core Cortex-A7 CPU, Adreno 302 GPU, Snapdragon 200 chipset, 1GB of RAM. Windows Phone 8.1 with Lumia Denim. 5MP autofocus camera with 480p video recording @30fps. 8GB of inbuilt storage, microSD card slot, up to 128GB. Free worldwide voice-guided navigation with HERE Drive+. The screen has low pixel density (not awfully visible, to be fair). Low battery capacity, especially for a dual SIM smartphone. It's a Lumia like the rest of them. A new youth player promoted to the first team, which will have no trouble blending in. It's just a different name on the familiar kit. Microsoft is starting from the bottom up - an entry level handset, no redesign to speak of. Lights will soon be out on Nokia Devices but Redmond isn't in a hurry to challenge the Finnish-made flagships just yet.. Yes, the Lumia 535 is just like the rest of them. The closest thing to a risk it's taking is screen size. Five inches of screen diagonal isn't unheard of at the low end but it's still a massive step up from the Lumia 520, which is the obvious predecessor.. The Microsoft Lumia 535 does well to up the resolution accordingly. qHD isn't ideal on a 5" screen but the pixel density is effectively matching that of a Lumia 520 - it's what matters after all from a user perspective.. The Microsoft Lumia 535 probably uses the Nokia Lumia 520's camera and adds an LED flash to it. The predecessor had no front camera whatsoever and the Lumia 535 boasts a wide-angle, high-res selfie cam, as seen on the Nokia Lumia 735. The CPU has got an extra couple of cores - true, it's Qualcomm's cheapest but Windows Phone is known for running smooth on all sorts of hardware.. Here goes the Microsoft Lumia 535 complete package.. The neat design with the usually rich color options has always been part of the deal in the Lumia range. It's a budget WP smartphone we're talking about with a big screen and a high-res front camera. Not bad in terms of selling points considering the price is more than acceptable.. The screen isn't ridiculously pixel-rich but the extra size has its advantages in navigation, web browsing and office tasks.. The biggest turn-off is video recording - although the phone doesn't pretend to be anything special, 480p video isn't doing it a favor. Maybe it made sense to Microsoft to do proper 480p rather than poor 720p (Lumia 520), but we're merely guessing here. It's not the Snapdragon 200 to blame, it's not the single gig of RAM either. 480p video doesn't quite make sense on a device with higher than WVGA screen resolution.. To make up for it, the Lumia 535 is the second Lumia phone to offer a wide-angle 5MP front camera. It's entirely up to you how that's a benefit - selfies or Skype video calls.. The big screen, the dual SIM capabilities, the high-res front facer and the light price tag will sure raise the Lumia 535 above the majority of entry-level smartphones. We're about to test its real-life performance and see how it stacks against its siblings and the competition from outside the WP camp.. Unboxing, design and build quality, controls.

Mobiles / Microsoft Mobile Phones / Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual SIM Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 193 Launch Date in India: 26 November, 2014 Compare. Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual SIM Description. Various colour variants to choose from Battery life Great front camera Windows 8.1 OS. A price cut would do it good Display resolution could be better. Microsoft had acquired Nokia's mobile handset business some time ago but it took a while for it to take charge and do things its way. Finally and unfortunately, Nokia's name has vanished from Lumia smartphones and has made way for Microsoft. The first device to be launched with the new logo is Lumia 535 and it has a single SIM and a dual-SIM variant as well, out of which only the dual-SIM version will make it to our shores. But how does it stack up against the competition? Specifications. Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual SIM runs on Windows Phone 8.1 OS and has dual-SIM capability as well. A 1.2GHz quad-core processor can be found inside the Lumia 535 Dual SIM along with 1GB RAM. There is a 5-inch screen on Lumia 535 Dual SIM and it puts out display resolution of 960x540 pixels. There is 8GB internal storage provided on the Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual SIM and it can be expanded further up to 128GB using a microSD card. A 5-megapixel camera on the back and a 5-megapixel snapper up front can be found on the Lumia 535 Dual SIM. A 1905mAH capacity battery powers the Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual SIM and it should last for 13 hours of talktime before needing a recharge. Microsoft has not really changed the way Lumia smartphones are being made from the time when they came with Nokia brand name. But what seems to have changed is how Microsoft plans to market the Lumia devices. It has turned its attention to budget smartphones that drive volumes for smartphone makers. But what makes Lumia 535 Dual SIM special? Firstly, it does not charge a premium for what it offers. Secondly, its specs are pretty competitive against its competitors in the Android smartphone market. Lastly, even though Nokia name has gone away from Lumia 535 dual SIM, it is still made to same spec as those before it, be it build quality or fit and finish departments.

Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual SIM Reviews. Please feel free to post your review on this product.. Microsoft lumia is a best phone ever in lumia series. It has 5 mp front camera it is best part of the phone. Also is has dual sim and powerfull battery back up...and the best part is that it has support of Microsoft. So it can be best phone of Microsoft series. Microsoft need to release more than this type of phone to cover the market this time. So guys nithua to say this time to to shop and buy Microsoft lumia 535 phone dual sim.. I think microsoft is a good brand for Windows lovers. It works smoothly in 1900 mah battery power. It has a graceful display which looks awesome and it has unique design also. But sometime it suffers due to windows app because you can not use android apps in this phone and windows app store has very less apps and they have functions than android apps. Finally it is a good phone for windows lovers and for fast net surfing.. Microsoft Lumia 535 operates on windows 8 upfradeble to 8.1 and the latest windows 10 version.This supports vides call with both back nad front camera.It has sensitive touch features,Glance screen features.It has Quallocom Snapdragon quad core processar.It has 1 GB ram and 8 GBinternal momery expandeble to 32 GB.Windows store apps can be stored in SD card also.Cortana is the personal assistant in this phone.Overal this is a well featured phone.. Lumia 535 dual sim is the best phone under 10000. I can asphalt8 dream league soccer which takes up to 1gb but then also my phone doesn't hang. And the,most thing is the style of the phone. Internal memory 8gb and ram 1gb. A day will come when Microsoft will beat Samsung Motorola lg etc. Nice smart phone and highly secure to do any bank transaction and payment on merchant website. 1gb ram but is good even to play heavy games. I recommend every one whose budget is low can purchase this phone. Mobile detection is good gps work fast and effective. All the necessary apps can be downloaded from windows store. Other good features of this smartphone include its upgrading to windows 20 when it is available for mobile. Loots of offers are available on paytm as and mobikwik on this device. Most of the day to day apps are pre installed on this phone. Lumia 535 coming with windows phone 8.1 operating system operating system.It has 1 GB RAM nad 8Gb internal memory expandable to 32 GB.It has quad core processor,sensitive touch and and both front as well as back camera. By virtue of its ultra sensitive touch one can use the phone even wearing gloves.It is available in both single and dual sim.It is now upgradable to the the latest released windows 10 operating system.You can store apps in SD card also,which is one of the best feture of this phone.Windows store is accessible in the phone.. The mobile was quite a good idea.i like the mobile .the response and the features of this mobile are great another one in the mobile it is same as and similar to all the good mobiles .this quick response of it are so much helpful to me and the camera also good to use having better quality and capturing good quality images.the sound quality also good having a HD images and having good camera also a hopeful at similar price.. Hi, i have a lumia 535.i used it since 1year.i would like to say battery was good.build quality was also good. After update in windows 10 it looks awesome. Even I can run high end games like modern combat 5, asphalt 8 etc. Camera was good.it has 5mp both camera.voice quality was good.otherwise it was a very good phone. I recommend you can buy Lumia 535 it is a very good phone.thank you.i rally appreciate if anyone buy this.because it worth it.. i use last 1 year lumia 535. My Lumia is a great product can't live without it. It hast a front and a back camera. It's front camera wide angle and back normal picture quality average. It has 1gb ram for android user it seems may little low but on windows it works great. But i like its battery it's worth of moneys but some time i really miss the android play store it has no various app but like android store but they got good and vital once like facebook whatsapp tweeter. But in that price i totally satisfy with the product i can chat call video chat game who wants more.. Thank you for the survey have a nice time.. Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual Sim is a average phone in my view. You have limited option to customize your phone, Lack of popular applications on the store like mx player. Poor sharing options mean you cant share apps via bluetooth. You cant backup your applications setups. But windows 10 is more efficient than previous one, so update your phone time to time. Poor audio quality in outdoor areas. Poor internet browser, so download third party browser.. Therefore if you want to try Windows os then buy this phone.. i think android mobile are best than lumia because there are some apps which are not available in lumia store so im not satisfied with lumia at all. so now i would like shift from lumia to android mobile phone, in lumia i am not able to upgrade os from windows 8 to 10, so you cant upgrade your os so it is useless mobile phone from my point of view. never buy lumia just go for android mobile phones. This device gas amazing features and good user interface (UI) the good features of this phone are extra battery life, different operating system, microsoft office , xbox, great design etc.. I'VE been using this phone from last one year and niether it have impressed me or niether depressed me but the battery life of the phone is amazing and same as from first day when i bought it and the touch screen of the phone is also better than others. The main problem which i faced is that it hangs some times in such a way you need to forcefully remove the battery. Overall i give it 3.5/5 rating to this phone.. For this product they mentioned that it has inbuilt gorilla glass. Recently I dropped my phone from my pocket and touch has broken instantly. I had to spend 3500 rs for touch and I am very disappointed because even microsoft is not able to make quality products. Coming to display,first of all it has very sensitive touch and I faced lot of touch issues. For example, It is not possible to type a message because if we press one thing , it is taking another. this is best phone aviable in a very low price.phone having a 5 inch qhd display with 220 ppi.it is powered by 1.2 ghz quad core processor with 1gb ram and 8 gb rom.internal memory is 8gb and it is expandable upto 128 gb.it has window 8.1 operating system which is also upgradable to win 10 also.phone is powered by a powerful 1900mah li-ion battery. Good battery life, average display size, Dual sim, Different operating system, windows phone, good quality of display. I sold this mobile 8,500 thousand only. Good camera quality rear and front. It is a different phone from android. But it has a problem ,this is hang. We solved the problem to remove battery from the handset. The front camera has 5 mega pixels. So it gives the good selfie. I have decide to take this phone because it's features are very good and has a very good cost. I own a Microsoft lumia 535 dual sim and i am using it from six months till now no problem occured it has 5-5 front-back camera which clicks decent pictures and it is upgradable to windows 10 mobile no lagging of apps no hang. The bad news is that the touch won't work nicely when phone is charging or attatched to a usb cable the earphone doesn't give loud volumes The glossy finish of back cover is nice but is scratched. Ram and rom of mobile is good. Battery backup of this is good. This mobile is good for clicking selfies.. Bad thing of this mobile is its main camera which is 5mp but quality of camera is very bad. Its operating system is window which is bad than the android. although it has a battery of 1950 mAh, since it donot need a background play, the batterylife is considerably good... 1GB ram powers the gaming experience. sharing of apps is not at all possible..there is only password lock! its difficult to share media files comparing to android devices. It's a awesome phone Microsoft Windows Lumia 535 there are many feature in this phone and its a compatible with apple IPhones because there are many features like iPhones so that's it all over its a awesome and also all series of Microsoft Windows phones is good.. Only flash light is not Available when Incoming calls or SMS and some time its just hang and when it is in my pocket its working automatically but you improved it otherwise its awesome. i m using this phone from many times it is the best windows phone ...and the battery backup is very best.....so i just want to say everyone that you have to buy this phone. it is the best phone for using in daily life.its different from android phone..ihen this phone the battery backup is very good ..and its very simple for using .the phone look is very best ..basically the black volour is too good....we cAN take it in window 10 operator...in this phone the offline map and the loacation finder is very best....if any time the phone would stolen.we can find it to check phone location on microsoft site.
