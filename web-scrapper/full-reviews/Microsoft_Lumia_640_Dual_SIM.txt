Too little RAM memory (1 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (294 ppi). The Microsoft Lumia 640 features a 5-inch HD display, comes in a range of vivid colors, and runs on Windows Phone 8.1 (it's set to get upgraded to Windows 10 in the not too distant future). The Lumia 640 has all the options you'd expect from an affordable phone: more specifically, it arrives in a single- and dual-SIM versions with both a 3G model and 4G LTE version of the handset, including a dual-SIM LTE device. The handset comes in a range of colors including cyan, orange, black and white. It's also got an 8-megapixel camera with dynamic flash and auto HDR, as well as a front-facing camera with wide-angle lens. It is pre-loaded with the latest Lumia camera app update.. Microsoft Lumia 640 Review Microsoft Lumia 640 hands-on Microsoft Lumia 640 manual Microsoft Lumia 640 benchmarks. Dimensions: 5.56 x 2.84 x 0.35 inches (141.3 x 72.2 x 8.8 mm). Weight: 5.11 oz (145 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 5.0 inches. Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 3), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI). Software Features: Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets, Shutter speed control. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Scenes, Effects. Features: Continuous autofocus, Video light, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 26.50 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 36.0 days (864 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 17.50 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: DLNA.

If I buy this phone in USA ( from Expansys, IL ) can I update it to build 15184 as per the article which says it will support WIFI calling feature for T-Mobile USA and EE, UK. But it also says the update will be OTA. But as every on eknows, T-Mobile USA. does not sell DUAL sim version of lumia 640 in which case how can OTA will work?. I basically looking for a dual sim, LTE with wifi calling feature to be used in T-Mobile network.. I have the same question (1). I have not heard from any one to my question. Can some one help me please?. youtube.com/mymarciotv If you found my answer helpful click "Me Too" to let others know.. [visit this site for more info]. install the network's app or appropriate version of the operating system to support the particular carrier (EE's) WI-FI calling feature.. You don't need DUAL SIM for OTA Updates (over the air updates). What this means is that your phone will get a notification through the T-Mobile network to let you know that an update is available.

Regarding the WI-FI calling feature, you might need to:. In reply to ArkEngel's post on July 24, 2015. I am well aware of how these things work as I am using GSM since 1999.. The question is T-Mobile does not sell Dual SIM and if they don't sell, then I can't get OTA update form T-Mobile. So if I buy this from. Expansys-Usa.com, then I cant get any updates unless until I can get the firmware file from some where then I can update it.. In reply to NishRags's post on July 22, 2015.

A large group of professionals built the Titanic.". I cannot imagine any carrier supporting a dual-SIM handset. I am prepared to bet that the handset you are interested in will not be supported by T-Mobile US and will not get the functionality you are looking for.. In reply to 93tid's post on July 29, 2015. I am fully aware of that for your info. Since EE is claiming that it will work, ( though they did not mention about this particular DUAL SIM ) , I have my own doubts of it working with T-Mobile. I have done enough research by the way on this issue.. Talked to even T-Mobile and they said you can try and see if it works. Only thing is I have to get it from EE UK, since Expansys-usa is not resourcing it from UK.. Buy online, pick up in store.

Information about some specific features related to the SIM card(s) of the device.. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) was developed to replace the analog cellular network (1G), therefore it is referred to as a 2G mobile network. It has been improved with the addition of General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) and later via the Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) technology.. UMTS stands for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System. Based on the GSM standard, it is deemed as a 3G mobile network standard. It has been developed by the 3GPP and its major advantage is the provision of greater bandwidth and spectral efficiency, due to the W-CDMA technology.. There are several network technologies that enhance the performance of mobile networks mainly by increased data bandwidth. Information about the communication technologies supported by the device and their respective uplink and downlink bandwidth.. Information about the operating system used by the device as well as its version.. Name and version of the user interface (UI) used by the operating system (OS).. The SoC integrates different hardware components such as the CPU, GPU, memory, peripherals, interfaces, etc., as well as software for their functioning.. Information about the process technology used in manufacturing the chip. The value in nanometers represents half the distance between elements that make up the CPU.. CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors. They increase the performance of the device allowing the execution of multiple instructions in parallel.. The frequency of the processor describes its clock rate in cycles per second. It is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. GPU is a graphical processing unit, which handles computation for 2D/3D graphics applications. In mobile devices GPU is usually utilized by games, UI, video playback, etc. GPU can also perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the CPU.. Similar to the CPU, the GPU consists of processing units called cores. They handle the computation of graphics in various applications.. RAM (Random-Access Memory) is used by the operating system and all installed applications. Data in the RAM is lost after the device is turned off or restarted.. Information about the capacity of the built-in storage of the device. Sometimes one and the same model may is offered in variants with different internal storage capacity.. The various types of memory cards are characterized by different sizes and capacity. Information about the supported types of memory cards.. One of the main characteristics of the display is its type/technology, on which depends its performance.. In mobile devices display size is represented by the length of its diagonal measured in inches.. The ratio between the long and the short side of the display. The display resolution shows the number of pixels on the horizontal and vertical side of the screen. The higher the resolution is, the greater the detail of the displayed content.. Information about the number of pixels per centimeter (ppcm) or per inch (ppi) of the display. The higher the pixel density, the more detailed and clearer is the information displayed on the screen.. The color depth of the display is also known as bit depth. It shows the number of bits used for the color components of one pixel.

Information about the dimensions of the image sensor used in the device. Usually cameras with larger sensors and less pixel density tend to provide better image quality despite the lower resolution.. A smaller pixel size allows the image sensor to use more pixels thus providing better image resolution. On the other hand, this may negatively impact noise levels and decrease image quality at high ISO settings.. Crop factor is the ratio of the dimensions of a full frame camera's sensor (36 x 24 mm, which equals the frame size of a 35 mm film) and the dimensions of the image sensor of the device. The number shown is the ratio between the diagonals of a full frame sensor (43.3 mm) and the device sensor.. Aperture (f-stop number) indicates the size of the lens diaphragm opening, which controls the amount of light reaching the image sensor. The lower the f-stop number, the larger the diaphragm opening is.. Focal length is the distance in millimeters from the focal point of the image sensor to the optical center of the lens. A focal length, which results in the same field of view on a full-frame (35 mm) camera, is also provided.. Cameras of mobile devices use mainly a LED or a Xenon flash. The LED flash has a softer burst of light and in contrast to the much brighter Xenon flash, is used for recording videos as well.. One of the main characteristics of the cameras of mobile devices is their resolution, which shows the number of pixels on the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the image.. Information about the maximum resolution available for shooting a video with the device.. Information about the maximum number of frames per second (fps), supported by the device while recording a video at maximum resolution. Some of the main standard frame rates for recording and playing video are 24p, 25p, 30p, 60p..

Microsoft Lumia 640 Dual SIM Review. Author Sandeep Sarma Posted on April 20, 2015 May 30, 2015 Categories Microsoft , Photo Gallery , Reviews , Windows. Average Camera (Bad Low Light Performance and High Colour Noise). "Microsoft Lumia 640 Dual SIM Review" , 4 out of 5 based on 19 ratings.. The Lumia 640 is one of the latest phones that Microsoft announced post the Nokia takeover. It is the successor to the Lumia 630. The 640 was announced alongside its larger brother, the 640 XL at MWC (Mobile World Congress) in Spain last month. Both the handsets run Windows 8.1 out of the box. Let’s dive into the review to see whether the handset is a good bang for the buck you pay.. The first time you look at the phone itself, you realize that this is a Lumia device. Despite the Mircosoft branding replacing the Nokia one, the design language still remains very much the same. The rounded edges, the flashy colours, the polycarbonate back etc. When you hold the 640 in your hand for the first time, you immediately have the impression that it is quite light. While it definitely does feel light, it actually isn’t much so. It weighs in at 145 grams which Is heavier than most 5 inch display phones apart from those with a metal construction. For example it is heavier than the Galaxy S4 and the Nexus 5 but it weighs the same as a Galaxy S5. The reason behind the lightweight feeling is the weight distribution. We feel that Microsoft has done a great job at distributing the weight evenly. The handset is also a bit big in terms of physical dimensions. It measures 141.3×72.2×8.8mm and it does feel a bit big.. The bezels on the front are quire big especially the ones to the sides of the display. But the curved back does make the phone a bit easier to handle. The flat sides do take a bit of getting used to especially since the edges aren’t beveled on the front as they are at the back. But once you are used to it, it’s pretty easy to handle.. On the front you have the 5 inch ClearBlack display above which you have the earpiece in the center. Towards the left of the earpiece are the sensors and the front facing camera. Below the display you will find the microphone. There are not capacitive keys below the display as Microsoft has resorted to on screen navigation keys.. At the top you have the 3.5mm audio jack and you have the microUSB port at the bottom.. The left side of the phone is left empty while the right side houses the volume up/down rocker button and the power/lock key. We quite like the feedback that we got from the keys. They were properly raised well from the body so they were easy to locate and press. They also provided good feedback through satisfying clicks.. At the back you have the 8 megapixel camera unit alongside which you will see the LED flash. There’s a Microsoft branding in the center and at the bottom right you have the loudspeaker.. The devices offers really good grip especially on the matte variants. The 640 comes in a glossy finish in Orange, White and Cyan while the Black variant gets a matte finish. We feel the colour options to be quite good and should appeal to a wide range of customers both male/female and young/older. The matte finish also prevents fingerprints from sticking onto the device’s back.Although we haven’t spent too much time with the glossy variants, we found that in our short time with it itself that it was quite prone to fingerprints and you’ll need to clean the back cover quite regularly to keep it clean.. The back cover is removable and so is the battery. Under the battery cover you will find the Dual microSIM slots and the microSD card slot. Unfortunately the microSD card slot isn’t hot swappable and you have to take out the battery to access it. Despite having a removable battery cover, the device feels as solid as a phone with a unibody. There are no creaks or flexing of the back cover even when pressed.. The Lumia 640 has a 5 inch IPS LCD panel with ClearBlack display technology. It has a resolution of 1280×720 pixels and is protected by Gorilla Glass 3. While fingerprints easily appear on the display, we were happy to note that after using the device for our review the device still showed no signs of scratches on the glass which proves that it’s quite durable. We’ve seen a few phones that have scratches on the front glass a day or two into testing itself. The display is quite bright and we found that you didn’t have to crank the brightness up much due to the high contrast. Especially indoors we rarely had to use a setting higher than low. The viewing angles on the device is really good too and unless you’re looking at the display from a really ridiculous angle, the display will appear as bright and contrasty as usual. Outside, the device performs just as well. The contrast is quite good and while you will definitely have to crank up the brightness (you can set it to auto and let the phone do it for you), the sunlight legibility is very good. Despite only packing a 720p display, we felt that the content displayed was quite sharp and crisp and that at a size of 5 inches, this resolution is good enough especially for a lower end phone such as this.. The phone allows double tap to wake which works very well and the success rate of waking the device up with double taps is quite high. The haptic feedback is also very good. The colours are quite vivid and punchy. It’s a bit unnatural but most customers like that. For the user who prefers a more natural settings, Microsoft offers various colour profile modes to choose from including an advanced mode where you can tweak it to your own liking.. You can also change the brightness levels at each setting of Low, Medium and High.. The dialer is large and easy to see and use. You can easily choose which of the two sims you want to use before making the call. The people app is the contacts app and shows you the names of your contacts along with thumbnails of photos you’ve assigned to each.. As always with Lumia phones the call quality is really good on the Lumia 640. The earpiece is loud and clear and the person on the other end of the line can easily be heard even in the noisiest of environments. Similarly the noise cancelling works well and your speech is also audible clearly to the other party. The phones ringtone volumes are very loud too and the vibration is strong. The phone supports dual SIM cards, both microSIM but no LTE on either of them.. Messaging is an easy task thanks to the good keyboard that’s built in. The keyboard layout is quite comfortable and is easy to get used to. The screen provides good real estate for typing even to those who have large fingers. We feel that with the size of the screen would’ve been to have number shortcuts as well instead of having it in a second page. You can also swipe/trace words if you prefer inputting that way.. The phone supports all the latest standards of Wi-Fi 802.11 including n and ac. It has micro USB 2.0 and Bluetooth 4.0. The phone packs 8GB of internal memory and despite packing 2 microSIM slots, you’ll be delighted to know that Microsoft have included a microSD card slot as well. Cards upto 128GB are supported however due to the device’s performance we are not quite sure how well it will handle cards of such large capacities. We were able to use a 32GB microSD on the device without any issues. Out of the 8GB of built in memory the user gets around 7.28GB of free space at his/her disposal.. The Lumia 640 just like its bigger brother the 640 XL comes with Windows Phone 8.1 (Lumia Denim) out of the box. Microsoft has promised that the device will get an upgrade to Windows 10 as and when it releases. The phone is powered by a Snapdragon 400 processor and has 1GB of RAM. The phone performs without hanging and we never had the phone reboot or crash on us while testing. However we noticed that there was always a slight lag when you navigate through the interface. Can’t help but feel that you are always waiting for the device to catch upto your commands. We feel that Android devices of the same price point do perform much better in terms of speed and responsiveness. There were no issues in multi-tasking. We ran multiple apps together without any crashes whatsoever but like we mentioned earlier, it does feel a bit slow even when switching between apps.. The lockscreen is quite nice and you can assign different apps to show their updates and notifications on the lockscreen. In our case we quite loved how the Weather app displayed on the lockscreen. keeps changing its background based on the weather conditions in your location. The homescreen is a colourful affair. You can choose to have tiles in a particular colour against a white or black backdrop. You can adjust the size of the tiles and also use live tiles for the apps that support them. You can assign a background image which will get overlayed on supporting tiles.. The notification drawer is another welcome addition to Windows 8.1. The quick toggles are customizable and you can have a maximum of 4 quick toggles at a time. There is also a shortcut to the settings from there.. The glance screen is a neat feature that shows the notifications and time even when the device is on standby. You can choose from peek where the glance screen works for 30 seconds after locking you device and disappears after. You can also choose for it to appear for a short duration at regular intervals or also to stay on all the time. You can also choose whether to hide the notifications and also different modes for the glance screen while the device is being charged. You can choose to turn off glance screen all together as well if you wish. In our experience the glance screen doesn’t really affect the battery life much and is a feature we found to be quite useful. We didnt notice the device getting hot during our usage of the device, at worst maybe it got a bit warm.. The camera on the 640 is an 8 Megapixel camera unit with autofocus and an LED flash. The camera is quite capable in well lit conditions. The detailing is quite good and captures good detail. The processing is quite natural and the dynamic range is quite impressive from such a handset. There is a bit of chromatic aberration and purple fringing but not something you would realize much unless you zoom in and look carefully. The output should look good on most social channels that you want to share with but don’t expect to be taking great quality prints with it. The camera can also focus up quite close to objects. The camera performance totally goes the other way when used in low light conditions. There’s too much of color noise creeping into the photos and the shutter times are quite long often resulting in blurry photos. You can click on the samples below to view the full resolution images.. The Lumia Camera interface is quite similar to the one you find on the other Lumia phones. You get quite a lot of detailed controls such as ISO, exposure, white balance etc. It allows you to tweak and get the best out of the camera. You can choose between 16:9 or 4:3 ratios. You can even capture moving images (cinemagraphs). You can choose from a wide range of framing grids to help assist you in composing the photo including rule of thrids, golden ratio or square to help you with your instagram purpose photos.. You even have options for bracketing the photos if you wish to create manual HDR photos. Holding down the shutter button triggers the burst mode or the video mode based on the option you choose. The Lumia Selfie app and the refocus app are neat additions to the Lumia camera. You can also download other lenses from the app store to get different types of effects for your photos.. The front camera again has issues with noise and colour fringing. Again it does fairly alright in well lit condition but in low light it is pretty bad and odds are you wont want to use those photos for your social feeds. Video recording is decent but nothing really out of the ordinary and it maxes out at 1080p resolution at 30fps. You have the option of recording at 25 and 24fps as well with 1080p resolution or going smaller as well.. For a device of its range the 640 has pretty good audio quality. The volume through earphones and headphones is more than enough and the audio quality is quite good. There is a bit of crosstalk and noise but only at the highest levels. As it has a 3.5mm audio jack, you can use just about any earphone/headphone that’s available in the market. The speaker on the back is quite loud and while there’s a bit of distortion at the highest volumes. Due to the location of the speaker, the audio does get muffled if you place it on a flat surface. The bundled earphone isn’t very good and you’re better off getting 3rd party earphones/headphones that can make better use of the phones audio capabilities.. The music player supports MP3s, AAC, WMA and WAV files. You can sort your tracks according to artists, albums, songs, genres and playlists. If you have an XBox Music account, you can link the music player to that. There aren’t any fancy settings or equalizers here. You get the Rewind/Previous, Play/Pause and Forward/Next buttons along with Album art and the song timeline through which you can seek the tracks. It also supports shuffle and repeat.. The Lumia 640 is powered by a 2500mah battery. The battery compartment is accessible thanks to the removable back cover and the battery itself is removable too. The battery life on the Lumia 640 is quite good and should get even heavy users through a full day of use. 3G data was always on and occasionally connected to WiFi. The standby power draw is a bit higher than normal and we feel its something Microsoft could and should address in future software updates. This happens regardless of whether the phone had glance screen on or off. We will be running the phone through our usual battery test and will give you an update regarding the same soon.. The Lumia 640 is a pretty decent performer. It’s got a great screen, good audio, good build and call quality. The support for Dual SIM and microSD card expansion is a bonus. Where it does fail to impress is the performance. The phone seems to drag along even when performing basic tasks. The experience should only get better with future updates though and Windows 10 should bring in a bunch of new features as well. The camera performs well in good lighting conditions but totally underperforms otherwise. A future update could help improve this. If you are fine with phones running other OSes then perhaps you should evaluate your options more. But if you are looking to get a Windows phone handset then this is pretty good option and offers decent value for money.. The Microsoft Lumia 640 is available exclusively through Flipkart at a price of Rs 11,999.. Sandeep Sarma is a blogger and a freelance photographer.

Microsoft Lumia 640 Dual SIM User Reviews. BASED ON 5,143 RATING(S). 24 Apr 2015 By Amit Chowdhury On flipkart.com. Great phone, have been using it for a month or so now. I made a day trip out of station recently. Left home at 6AM in the morning, in a full day of use without charging - I made 3-4 calls for around 5-8 mins duration, used my mails and WhatsApp intermittently throughout the day - the battery was still showing at 70% when I returned back home at 11PM in the night. Sounds are loud and clear to me and for the receiving party too. Quality screen - very readable and color looks vibrant. no problem in broad daylight and outdoors. This is both good and bad. nThe good part - one of the major reason for buying this phone was that it supports 'Glance Screen'. I can see time, new message notifications, whether battery is charging or not without switching on the screen.nThe Bad is at the end below. nI love the black phone with matt black plastic back. It gives the phone a 'held back sophisticated' look (like wearing a black suite instead of bright blue one) - goes well in office settings. nn- The detachable back and SD card support and music playernFor around 1.5K I bought a 64GB microSD card and now I have a 64GB music player in my pocket always. Transferring my iTunes playlist was seamless (I was an iPod user earlier) using WindowsPhone app on my Mac. nnNot happy about:n- The charger! nThey decided to pack in a very lame battery charger. Usually mobile chargers are compact and have detachable USB cable, which you can detach and use it as data cable. For 640 they gave a biggish, three pronged charger which has old fashioned power cable permanently attached to it. I didn't end up using it - using a two pronged charger (which has detachable usb cable) from an old phone. nn- Glance screen.nFor some %^&* reason, Lumia decided to remove display of dates and detailed notification (example, the details - subject, time, place - of next appointment in your calendar) from Glance Screen. Its there in the older Lumia models but not in this new 640.nThis was a big disappointment for me personally, but guess will not apply for everybody. nBut putting this info out there for the folks who are big user of Glance Screen.. 13 Apr 2015 By Suseendiran On flipkart.com. The biggest doubt i had before buying this phone was about the front camera. But, It clicks amazing selfies because of its HD resolution. I have not faced any issue till now (using it for the 5th day). No lag and we dont even need to consider about heating problem because there is absolutely no heating at all. Battery gives backup for more than a day even if we use the phone for most of the time. Flipkart delivered it within one day. Everythng seems good about this phone.

Love the phone but everytime i touch the screen it moves inside its own back cover (video shows exactly my problem):. I have tried to ask for help over the phone from lumia support. and from the microsoft store people I actually communicated with at the time of purchase but there seems to be no aftersale support for these phones.. Anyone has any ideas on how to get my hands on a replacement back cover? even if I will have to pay for one.. I have the same question (2). ---------------------------------------------------------------- "Remember that a lone amateur built the Ark. A large group of professionals built the Titanic.". Just return it to the store for a replacement.. In reply to 93tid's post on November 5, 2015. That is not the best option for me as I would be left with no phone for a long period of time, the phone was purchased online and it was shipped from Germany to Ireland.. I have been contacting technical support again and I have to say as helpful as they where when they sold me the phone I have endured some very confusing conversations with the support people, I was transferred 3 times to departments that have nothing to. Talking to a lady about my windows phone when she is providing support for Microsoft Office its quite irritating.. To me it seems there is no department that deals with the hardware itself.. In reply to DannyCraciun's post on November 5, 2015. ---------------------------------------------------------------- "Remember that a lone amateur built the Ark. A large group of professionals built the Titanic.". My 640 dual SIM does exactly the same. It is definitely not a quality made phone and I don't think a new back cover will make any difference. I have resigned myself to it and use a Nillkin cover, which makes it more tighter. from a Microsoft Care facility, find the one nearest you and talk to them.. In reply to 93tid's post on November 5, 2015. The people in the video I posted said getting a new cover fixed their problem. Don't get me wrong I am fully aware of the quality hence the price but even so .... Again not an option for me as there is not Microsoft Care Facility in Ireland.... Will try a cover thanks for the suggestion that actually looks nice.. In reply to DannyCraciun's post on November 6, 2015. ---------------------------------------------------------------- "Remember that a lone amateur built the Ark. A large group of professionals built the Titanic.". Again not an option for me as there is not Microsoft Care Facility in Ireland.... Did you not click on the link in my previous post ?. In reply to 93tid's post on November 6, 2015. Hah sorry didn't notice the link and was convinced I looked on their site and the closest one was in Northern Ireland, will visit them tomorrow.. Buy online, pick up in store.

Microsoft Lumia 640 Dual Sim je smart telefon puÅ¡ten u prodaju u aprilu 2015. Osnovna karakteristika ovog ureÄaja jeste to da moÅ¾e da podrÅ¾i koriÅ¡Äenje dve micro-SIM kartice koje rade u dual stand-by reÅ¾imu Å¡to znaÄi da je jedna sim kartica nedostupna kada razgovarate preko druge. Ima IPS ekran osetljiv na dodir od 5.0 inÄa, Äija tehnologija omoguÄava jasnu sliku iz bilo kog ugla gledanja. Pored toga, ekran ima ClearBlack tehnologiju koja ukljuÄuje filtere za smanjenje odraza sunÄeve svetlosti na ekranu. Lumia 640 Dual Sim radi na Windows Phone 8.1 platformi, koja pruÅ¾a pristup Windows Phone Store-u, gde moÅ¾ete preuzeti sve Å¾eljene aplikacije. JoÅ¡ jedna zanimljiva osobina Microsofta su ploÄice u korisniÄkom interfejsu koje omoguÄavaju korisniku da modifikuje i napravi svoj poÄetni ekran. Primarna kamera od 8MP sa autofokusom i LED blicem pretvoriÄe vaÅ¡e lepe trenutke u predivne fotografije. Kada koristite ovaj telefon, ne postoji bojazan da ce vas izneveriti usled potroÅ¡nje baterije, jer Li-Ion baterija od 2500mAh moÅ¾e da izdrÅ¾i i do 35 dana u stand-by reÅ¾imu.. Koristim ovaj telefon viÅ¡e od godinu dana i moram priznati prelaskom na Windows 10 samo mi zadaje probleme. Problem W10 telefona je Å¡to su aplikacije slabe, a mnoge sistemske imaju velike bagove, poput kamere koja nakon slikanja ne saÄuva poneku sliku ili je jednostavno izbriÅ¡e, zatim update mnogih sistemskih aplikacija ume da izbaci error koji ni nakon mnogih pokuÅ¡avanja i spajanja sa kompijuterom ne moÅ¾ete otkloniti. Dok sam ga koristila uz W8 nije bilo problema,delovao je kao sjajan prelazak sa Android ureÄaja, meÄutim postajem sve nezadovoljnija a prevenstveno jer Microsoft se ni malo ne trudi da ga unapredi a pojedine aplikacije su katastrofalne (LinkedIn npr. a Äinjenica da je Microsoft kupio ovu kompaniju je nedopustiva greÅ¡ka da se aplikacija ne poboljÅ¡a). Svakako odnos cena-kvalitet je sjajan jer za ovaj novac Äete naÄi Android koji ima dosta bagova, i Äija je verzija veoma veÄ uveliko zastarela za update i promene. Ali obazrivo prilikom prelaska na W10.. Ovom telefonu je u sustini dodato sve sto fali Lumii 630, a to su npr prednja kamera, blic, veci RAM itd. Glavna kamera je dobrog kvaliteta, ne vrhunska ali ima prolaznu ocenu, dok je prednja losija. Radi fluidno i brzo, nije mi imao ni jedan bag. Zamerku imam na kvalitet plastike od koje je izradjen, veoma je osetljiva i meka. Naravno tu je i problem oko aplikacija, koje kasne po par godina za Androidom i iOS, standardno. Sve u svemu, za ove pare veoma solidan telefon.. Odlican telefon, verovatno i best buy u top cenovnom rangu. Operativni sistem radi fluidno, bez kocenja, kamera je jako dobra, pogotovo u night mode, kvalitet izrade, ekrana i zvuka zadovoljavaju sve potrebe prosecnog korisnika. Kome ne smeta windows phone operativni sistem, sigurno nece pogresiti kupovinom ovog telefona.. telefon je kompletno izradjen od plastike, sto vizuelno odaje utisak nizeg kvaltiteta. Posedujem ovaj telefon veÄ skoro godinu dana i zaista se ne mogu poÅ¾aliti. Materijal izrade je priliÄno dobar, naravno u odnosu na druge telefone tog cenovnog ranga, i lepo leÅ¾i u ruci. Telefon nije prevelik a ni suviÅ¡e mali. Rezolucija ekrana i zadnja kamera su odliÄni. NajveÄi adut ovog telefona je operativni sistem koji se pokazao izvanredno, posebno kada se nadogradi na windows 10, dobijate potpuno drugaÄiji telefon koji Äe zadovoljiti svakog proseÄnog korisnika, pa Äak i malo zahtevnijeg. Telefon radi bez koÄenja i "bagovanja". Jedina mana koja se mora spomenuti je manja preciznost tastature, ali niÅ¡ta preterano, mnogo bolje nego kod lumia 535.

Telefon imam nedelju dana, savrseno radi, kompaktan, lepo lezi u ruci, idealne velicine... Jedino sto korisnici koji su do sada imali android moraju da se naviknu na nesto drugaciji izbor aplikacija ali manje vise sve je (za sada uglavnom nesto slabiji) pandan andorid aplikacija...Za prosecnog korisnika kome ne treba brutalna kamera ili brdo aplikacija, najbolji moguci telefon na trzistu, da ne bi svi isli okolo sa belim samsunzima.. Telefon je sasvim OK, dobar odnos cena - kvalitet... Za tu cenu mislim da se ne trenutno moze dobiti bolji. Cekam windows 10 mobile, koji jos uvek ne moze da se preuzme za ovaj telefon. Mislio sam da vec moze, ali jos uvek ne moze. Sa sajta Microsofta se moze skinuti aplikacija kojom korisnik sam moze da vrati stari operativni sistem, ako mu novi ne bude odgovarao.. Ako je neko navikao na android trebace mu dosta vremena da se navikne na nove aplikacije.. Brz,ne koci,kamera odlicna sve radi fluidno.Baterija je cudo sta moze da izdrzi i koliko dugo. Sistem sa dve kartice radi odlicno,memorija sasvim dovoljna jer na windowsu moze se veci deo aplikacija prabaciti na sd karticu. Ko god se dvoumi oko ovog telefona-topla preporuka. Posle 3 nedelje koriscenja vrlo pozitivni utisci. Sistem sa dve kartice dobro funkcionise. Sistem : brz stabilan u radu se ne primeÄuje da ureÄaj ima 1GB rama Å¡to je u danaÅ¡nje vreme jako mali meÄutim Windows Phone OS oÄigledno ne zavisi od prejakog hardware. Dizajn : mogu reÄi samo ok. Baterija : moÄna 2-3 dana trajanje. Koristim ga tek oko desetak dana i za sad sam zadovoljna,baterija me dobro sluzi,nekad mi traje i duze od dva dana.. Super je telefon, uzeo sam ga bez dvoumljenja.... Da napomenem: Windows je mnogo bolji od Androida.... Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime Plus Dual SIM. Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016) Dual SIM LTE. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5A Dual SIM 16GB. Pozrav Administratoru, pošto Å¾elim kupiti ovaj teefon,zanima me,da li u dual sim sistemu, postoji moguÄnost korišÄenja dva viber-a,ili je jedan broj glavni za viber?No i bez obzira na viber,ovakav telefon za sigurno Äu kupiti. Poštovani, kada se oÄekuje da Äe ovaj model biti opet u prodaji? Prošlo je dosta vremena kako nije dostupan pa se pitam da li uopšte da ga Äekam ili da se odluÄim za drugi model. pitanje je odlicno, na zalost nemam odgovor jer korisnickog iskustva sa dual sim uredjajima bas i nemam puno, a. dual uredjaj kao takav koristi 2 broja i da u tom slucaju bi prakticno trebalo da moze da se koristi 2 Viber naloga. Sada i mene kopka! Sigurn sam da postoji neki "in app switch" koji Vam nudi opciju izbora broja sa kojeg zelite koristiti ovu aplikaciju. Pretpostavljam da je kartica koja je primarna, ona koja u datom trenutku koristi Viber. Ako neko od posetioca ove stranice ima licno/provereno iskustvo, neka ga napise, komentar cemo objaviti! Unapred hvala!. Hvala Vam sto ste izdvojili vreme i podelili svoja iskustva i misljenje vezano za ovaj model sa posetiocima ove stranice i nama! Pozdrav. ovo jeste aktuelan model, ali ne mogu Vam pouzdan. reci da li i kada cemo ga imati posto nemam konkretnu najavu prispeca od strane dobavljaca....

Microsoft Lumia 640: A Windows 10 Ready Smartphone. Microsoft has recently launched the new Microsoft LUMIA 640. The new smartphone by Microsoft seems to thrill your senses with its multi-dimensionally perfect DNA. Microsoft Lumia 640 price is expected to land around INR 11,999. The device works smooth with no time lag and an exceptionally brilliant multitasking experience. Microsoft LUMIA 640 features a HD 5 inch display with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels. The 5 inch display offers a great view in all kinds of ambient light. The LUMIA 640 lenses are defined by the autofocus 8 megapixel rear camera, and an optimal 0.9 MP front camera, which is right up for the purpose of selfies and video calling. The primary camera supports 1080p video capture and is accompanied by an LED flash. Microsoft LUMIA 640 packs a trendy, slim and sleek design. Microsoft Lumia 640 is powered by a 1.2 GHz quad-core processor to be one of the few smartphones by Microsoft based on quick processing technology.

The added assets of the phone are Wi-Fi, Bluetooth v4.0, GPS and DLNA. The phone sensors include gyroscope, proximity and compass.. Great camera Compatible with Windows 10 Impressive display. No LTE support Less internal storage. Microsoft Lumia 640 review: Outgrowing the mold. Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE ticks all the right boxes making it an easy to recommend pickup. There is a mid-sized IPS 720p display enhanced with ClearBlack, the Snapdragon 400 chip handles Windows hassle-free, the 8MP camera turned out way above average and there are various connectivity and color options. Just like the XL model, you can get the Lumia 640 in a single-SIM LTE flavor, dual SIM 3G or dual SIM LTE.. Windows Phone 8.1 OS with Lumia Denim; Update-able to Windows 10 Optional dual-SIM & optional LTE 8GB of inbuilt storage, expandable via a microSD card slot Li-Ion 2,500mAh battery. No headset included in the retail package Cheaper Lumias get the same Snapdragon 400 chipset Only 3GB of internal storage left for the user. Nokia Lumia 635 is here with the plastic backing coming in either vibrant the Cyan or Orange, or the much duller black or white.This time around the corners have been a little more rounded off but it still feels a little slippery in the hand with not the best grip available at this range.The thickness of the handset has been knocked down a little and Microsoft has yet to confirm the exact dimensions of the new handset, but the buttons and features all remain in the same place with the power button sitting comfortably on the right for your thumb and a volume rocker just above.The back panel is removable allowing access to insert your SIM or a microSD card up to 128GB.. Similar design Lack of information in areas. The Lumia 640 has all of the features you would expect from a smartphone that’s twice the price. It’s got 1Gb RAM, a decent 8 megapixel camera, front-facing camera for video calls, a high resolution screen with practically print quality pixel density, the processor is fast, and it even has a (somewhat limited) version of the excellent Glance Mode. It’s certainly a step up from the Lumia 630 and 635 as well as the 5XX series, and it has a few things that put it ahead of the similarly-priced BLU Win HD LTE.. Decent camera with Rich Capture features Good screen & pixel density Removable battery Replaceable battery covers with multiple color options Comfortable ergonomic form factor & design. Old version of Glance Mode doesn’t show as much info Low resolution front facing camera No wireless charging option Back cover seems to scratch easily Spare BV-T5C batteries are expensive and hard to find. Everything good Battery Back camera Touch UI lag free Windows 10 Dobule tap to wake Sunlight readability Microsoft edge Speed. Front cam Battery drainage while gaming. I used Lumia 640 for last one year.. I never face any lags in working. Battery backup is unbelievable to compare any 2500mA android mobiles.. Camera clarity is awesome when in good lights. To much lags of application in store.. but nokia makes it so expensive so that no one can ever think to buy .... But now microsoft gives lots of features. Specially 8 mp and 5" screen ... snapdragon 400 processor which supports all games even gta with no lag.... which nokia never gives to a budget phones like 535 , 635 , 630. I really appreciated by my frndz when i show this phones to them.... Good battery even goes for 2 days. to say that i have lumia. better os vs 8.1 compared to vs 8. smooth gaming even asphalt and gta. sunlight readability and double tap to wake which no android phone will gives. 42 mbps 3.5 g speed which a 4g android phones will not give (21 mbps). supports full hd1080 p video recording from rear and hd 720 p from front which lumia 540 cant (i.e only 420 p). snapdragon 400 processor which is better as compared to lumia 540 with 200 snapdragon processor makes game smooth and fast. Dual sim which a windows phones mostly not gives. large storage space 8gb even expendable to 128 gb. Support hd video which lumia 540 cant. front camera support hd recording but it should be 5 mp for a better selfie which is presnt in lumia 540. Nokia brand is not present in phones which makes it less show offy but not so much. it should be a 4g lte phone as the speed is more than a 4g android phone. camera has to be zeiss optics which is present in its xl version. DISSOPPINTED WITH LOW LIGHT CAMERA QUALITY. IT SHOWS PIXALATION (SMALL DOTS) WHILE TAKING PHOTOS.. GOOD BATTERY LIFE GOOD DISPLAY SMOOTH TOUCH FASTER CPU SLIM ATTRACTIVE BUILT. DAYLIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY IS VERY NICE BUT LOW LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY IS VERY BAD DONT BUY IF U ARE USING IT FOR PHOTOGRAPHY PURPOUSE. Nice performance Little bad in touch....but not so big problem. Poor camera back and front Battery 4-5 hours. Enter each Pro in new line.. Enter each Con in new line.. Who Viewed This Also Viewed .... Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (6GB RAM + 64GB).

This surprisingly cheap phone is the way forward. I toyed with the idea of moving everything to Apple but I am a loyal and content Windows user (apart from my terrible Vista experience). Windows 10 looks like an amazing new development and I'm eagerly waiting for the upgrade for my Nokia phone and desktop. That will be awesome! The duel sim capability is one of the best features of this phone and I can't understand why it is not a standard feature in the UK as it is in so many other countries. One sim can be for a work number and the other personal. While in the UK I use two sims from different UK airtime providers and choose which sim to use depending on the cost of the call to who I'm phoning (Giffgaff to Giffgaff is free). When I travel out of the country for any length of time I pick up a local PAYG sim and use that for calls while having a UK number in case I get calls from home. My eyesight is typical of a 50+ user and I can easily manage to read the screen and the information. I am not interested in loading the phone with apps so I find all I need in the Windows store. The one thing I find a great bonus is the satnav app called HERE Drive+ which allows me to use my phone as a satnav while offline. The cost of the Lumia 640 phone is less than I paid for my rubbish Live 20 TomTom sat nav! Battery life is excellent and so far I haven't come close to running it down as I charge it every night. The Cortana talking app is not really of interest to me at the moment as I find it too gimmicky but maybe when I get bored (or lonely) I'll give it a try. I purchased this phone for the Windows system and duel sim capability, all the rest of the stuff that came with it is an amazing bonus and I'm a born again Windows preacher with a big smile on my wrinkled face. I have been busy buying a few wallets and covers to protect and customize my precious purchase and I'm well pleased with my new Lumia 640 friend. I hope Bill Gates reads this and sends me a Surface Pro tablet for being so kind about Windows. UPDATE April 2016 ***** This relates to upgrading to WIN 10 ***** I upgraded the phone to Windows 10 without too much of a problem. First you have to go to the windows store and download a program called "windows upgrade advisor" and it will allow you to make the upgrade. Unfortunately since the upgrade I have encountered a few annoying issues that make me wish I hadn't upgraded. It is possible to roll back to windows 8 but from what I read it is not straight forward and often causes even more problems with the system. My main issues are the constant update advisories that I wake up to most mornings. I know it is supposed to protect and improve functionality but my past experience of windows updates are that it often results in disrupting the smooth running of the system. I have continued to download the updates because I am not happy with the way Win 10 is on my phone at the moment. Maybe it's my imagination but the phone seems to run slower than before and although I said Cortana wasn't important to me, in the short time I got to know her before the upgrade I found it was a very useful app to speed up searching and using the phone hands free. The command "Hey Cortana" gets her listening in Win 8 but in Win 10 on the Lumia 640 the option to do this is not available and you have to click on the program and then on the mic to speak your command. It's really annoying me and I can't find an answer by searching except that it is just one of the issues people report after upgrading to mobile 10. There are other issues that can be found if you search the various forums but in general at this stage I would advise anyone to think twice before upgrading to Win 10 mobile. If you are happy with the phone running on win 8 then stay with it. I wish I had! ***Windows 10 UPDATE WARNING! This phone is a good phone but in the last few months Microsoft have forced upgrades and software changes on users that has changed my view on the functionality of it considerably. I'm seriously thinking of giving up on the Windows platform for mobile use as they have stripped back the most useful aps to a point that they are pathetic ghosts of their past. Here+ maps has been replaced by Maps and although it still works in offline mode it is not as user friendly as the previous program. One Note is a disaster example of trying to fix something that isn't broken and so many useful features have been removed. "Hey Cortana" no longer works with Win 10 and the latest change is the "Anniversary 10" upgrade that has updated Skype to a point that it is less interactive than it was 10 years ago. A terrible development in the wrong direction. I'm downgrading my review from the original 5 stars to 2 purely because of the MS changes. The phone is good but the WIN 10 upgrades have ruined it.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for multi-location transparent use.. My first smart phone, after decades of resiting the replacement of my trusty long-battery-life nokias. Works a treat, does what I need, the dual sim feature is tremendously easy and transparent (surprising for microsoft!!), battery life is great - unless you use lots of internet, wifi etc, then it goes down to normal smart-phon levels. Text messages even come up in threads for both sim cards, so you can choose which sim to send from (will default to what you used last time). I admit my 6 year old son get more out of it than I do, but hey.. it does exactly what I need. I bought an additional micro sim for data straight away, which I advise if you want to store pictures from the rather excellent (video) camera.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Excellent phone but not 4G as advertised.. I really like this phone, I needed a dual sim phone and wanted to upgrade my existing Lumia 630 when I broke the screen. I searched for a 4G dual sim and it seemed difficult to find one until this one came up. Well the advert says 4G LTE but the phone isn't. The guys at Gadget Express were really good with my enquiry and phoned back when they said they would. But they couldn't help me other than offer my money back. It seems that the Dual Sim 4G version of the 640 is difficult to get hold of in the UK. So I've declined their offer of money back and decided to stay with the phone until I can find a no frills 4G phone as good as this. I could buy an upmarket version but my working environment is a bit hazardous for an expensive phone.Everything else about this phone is perfect for Actually phoning, good volume on all aspects, easy to use etc etc.The camera is ok for a phone, I have a proper SLR for taking decent photos.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Good as just a phone. Was a good phone owned it for 2 years about phones don't tend to last me that long ,it's had its day moving back to android as I'm getting a car that supports android auto,sat nav ?,anyway was ok some games no longer work but as a phone for texts and calls internet hotspot it works I upgraded the is to win 10 but it's had its day time to move forward as technology moves on , I hope my next phone lasts as long. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Moving from Android, got Windows Mobile 10 update on second day with 640.. Got my 640 on Tuesday after I got back from my project abroad. This is my first Windows device since Windows Mobile around 2010. Since then I have been using a Galaxy Note 2, so I am having to adapt. I upgraded to Windows Mobile 10 yesterday, looking good to sync with my Surface Pro 3 notebook. Dual sim is very useful, can separate business from personal. As an old codger (68, still working n strange places with questionable people), I want to access and print out the user guide. 28 April follow-up: found a company - OTC Ltd - that offers printed manuals, could not find what I wanted on MS Lumia sites. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars great replacement for Samsung S2 - fast and light and no google apps!!. Early days but this seems to be a great phone so far and nice to escape all the google apps that more or less finished my Samsung S2 which has also been a brilliant phone. Disappointed that this item is advertised as having headphones but none in the box hence only 4 stars. Bigger than the S2 but still manageable, good clear screen and faster to navigate. Struggled a bit to understand the music but managed to upload mine to the xbox area but can't find a shuffle. Removed one app that had music as unable to find how to stop it playing! All in all I think this should last me quite a few years like the S2. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Only problem with the phone is that one of the sims will only work if put into the first slot ( Optus ). 4.0 out of 5 stars Optus has to be put in first slot ?. Has only got windows 8.1 Cant download apps as 8.1 is no longer supported. 2.0 out of 5 stars Outdated. 4.0 out of 5 stars Four Stars. After being an iphone phone for a long time I started to get fed up with the limited memory and charging problems. 5.0 out of 5 stars Beter than an iphone. Bad side is that when plugged, it will not switch off.. 3.0 out of 5 stars Three Stars. Bought as a present for a relative who is over 70 so something easy to use was a priority. I did help with initial set-up but she's got to grips with it and is happy with it. 4.0 out of 5 stars Good smart phone for the price. Great features from a mid range phone. Easily upgraded to Win 10 and great user interface. I am really pleased with the phone in the short time I have had it.. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great value Windows phone.. upgraded from nokia 920 all windows phone users will love it with the added bonus of two sims. 5.0 out of 5 stars upgraded from nokia 920 all windows phone users will love it with the added bonus of two sims.

I recall buying Microsoft phone for a friend and to use the phone, you have to have microsoft account and we spent 4 days to be to use a phone.
