By Aswin Balakrishnan | 10 May 2016. new techs like fingerprint scanner makes us more reliable. its ram capacity and efficiency and also the battery capacity are more attractive.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 8 out of 9 people found this review helpful. Awseome BIGGGGGG Phone, with high picture/voice clarity at Awesome price. By Venkatesan G V | 7 Oct 2016. Got it two days back from Snapdeal under the Deepavali offer. Belying all my expectations, based on various reviews, the Mi Max was awesome. I was already using Yu Yureka Plus. I didn't feel much difference in the size because of bezel of Yu. Even Yu, I was using only with 2 hands. It has premium looks with Gold Metal finish and premium features with Finger Print sensor, etc., I am totally impressed. Finger Print Sensor which is a breeze to use though took some time to set up.. After update with MiUi8, there was no WiFi set up or connectivity. 4G connectivity on Airtel 4G was swift and smooth.. 2.5D Glass (more or less the same 3D Glass found in Galaxy Edge, though not with functional edges), added to the beauty and premium looks. The option to have Clone Social Media apps is awesome (You can have two differnt Whatsapp/Facebook accounts with dual apps in the same phone). IR Blaster with Mi Remote app for almost all the gadgets, like TV, Set Top Box, AC, Fan, Camera, etc. Now, I can operate both my Set Top Box and Samsung TV with my Mi Max, like a breeze. NO need for separate remote controllers. Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 support (though the supplied charger is not a quick charger, we can buy one separately around 1-1.5 k). 3GB RAM, 32 GB ROM and support for up to 128 GB SD Card would make the inbuilt storage to a Whopping 160 GB which is better than most Laptops/Netbooks.. MyJio 4G offer available for purchase from Snapdeal was added bonus. Android Marshmallow 6.0 with option to uninstall apps directly from the desktop. Direct Feed Back option through App is a good move to know the pulse of the user.. The screen is buttery smooth, so it is very difficult to press and hold the app icons inside the desktop or from screen to screen. Though App drawer option is there, the direct uninstallation option is a bit troublesome. Normally, we would like to remove the app from desktop though don't want to uninstall it. While the phone has a quick charge option, Mi should have provided Quick Charger even as an option. Sound through speakers is Ok standard only, sometimes very feeble. Audio quality through headphones also lack detail or sharpness. Mi has not given Headphones in the box. So, we have to buy them separately.. Rear camera though boasts of 16 MP capacity, it lacks details in long shots and even macro shots. In fact, my Yu though with 13 MP rear camera was far, far better. The option to shrink the screen for single handed operation is not easy to start. Still I am not able to start using it. Let me see when or whether I succeed. Overall, I can say its a VFM product and full paisa vasool. I am a happy buyer with a BIG smile.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 4 out of 4 people found this review helpful.

CNET también está disponible en español.. Good, but too much phone to handle. The Good The Xiaomi Mi Max has a brilliant, massive 6.4-inch screen and ridiculously good battery life.. The Bad The phone's enormous size makes it hard to use one-handed; it's also heavy and sticks out uncomfortably in your pants pocket.. The Bottom Line The Xiaomi Mi Max's premium build, amazing battery life and superlarge screen make this a good phone for watching videos and playing games but the size makes it hard to use with one hand.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. If the phrase "too big" never made it into your vocabulary, then the 6.4-inch Xiaomi Mi Max was made for people like you. The display is bright and the battery lasts for a good, long time, but the question for any phone this large will always come back to size: is it too much for you, or can you work with it?. Phones don't need to be small, but they also shouldn't be hard to use one-handed. And let's be clear here, the Max is a strictly two-handed affair if you want to use it without difficulty (unless you have really large hands). I found it hard to reach apps, and it's just a pain to keep adjusting my grip to reach stuff at the top of the phone. Still, I guess the Mi Max is really useful to shade your face on a sunny day, and I do really like how the metal chassis feels in my hands.. The Xiaomi Mi Max is big enough to use as a shade if it's sunny outside.. Of course, the real reason you're buying this phone is to watch video and read -- e-books, articles, Facebook, whatever -- and the Mi Max is perfect for this. The large 6.4-inch full-HD (1,920x1,080 pixels) is sharp and vibrant, and Xiaomi's Sunlight Display technology makes details like words and images clearer under bright sunlight. Gaming on the phone was great. Asphalt 8 ran smoothly on High settings, and I actually liked having a bigger screen here.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News. Homeland Security's tall order: A hacker-free election. 'Annihilation' director wove memory into a dream-like movie. Dogecoin: The joke cryptocurrency that was too real for its own good.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. posted by Luis D.. Android - Android + Xiaomi - Xiaomi +. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction 6 years since its inception, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is still busy selling quality handsets at pupil-dilating prices. The Mi Max is its newest proposition – a gargantuan 6.44-inch phablet with a sleek metal body, nice specs, and seemingly great value for the ~$230 that Xiaomi wants for the base model. Is this another fledgling success for Xiaomi? Well, let's see! Design This is one of the largest phones you've ever seen... Unabashedly enormous it may be, but Xiaomi's phablet exhibits trim bezels and sides, a sleek metal body, and reasonable weight. Make no mistake, it's still a device that few jean pockets can contain, and it does demand two-handed usage, but it's not uncomfortable. Unlocking it with the fingerprint sensor on the back is quick and feels natural. We are also fond of the power and volume keys which are tight and sturdy. Overall, we think the Mi Max's design and build quality rank pretty well in its peculiar class. We would have loved a USB Type-C port in place of the microUSB one, though – it's a somewhat dated component on an otherwise modern device. Display The screen isn't amazing, but most of its flaws can be forgiven. The 6.44-inch display is good, but not remarkable. It has a 1080 x 1920 resolution, which suffices, but its colors are on the colder side and appear darker than they actually are. The viewing angles are solid, but the display left us squinting badly to make out something on a relaxed sunny day, despite its strong brightness output. Overall, the display quality is acceptable, but not exemplary. After all, you get what you pay for, and in this case , the Mi Max's screen is right on the money.. 6.81 x 3.48 x 0.3 inches. 173.1 x 88.3 x 7.5 mm. 6.19 x 3.17 x 0.31 inches. 157.1 x 80.6 x 7.9 mm. 6.37 x 3.19 x 0.29 inches. 161.7 x 80.9 x 7.4 mm. 7.35 x 3.8 x 0.3 inches. 186.6 x 96.6 x 7.6 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The numbers below represent the amount of deviation in the respective property, observed when a display is viewed from a 45-degree angle as opposed to direct viewing.. Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Xiaomi Mi Max Compare.

Okay for everyone wondering about it being dim, I own the Mi Max and trust me, it's not that bright. You get an OK view outdoors in extreme sunlight/cloudy days, but its not the best performer. The only thing that makes it so bright is the fact that it uses a neutral tone than most phones. Not a yellowish hue (warm), not a blueish hue (cool), just somewhere right in between at a perfect white, resulting in a better outdoor viewing experience, but again, not the best out there..

It doesn't deserve anything more than a 7 in my old, worn-out book... MIUI is poorly, just poorly optimized... Just watch some videos over Youtube and you'll see what I mean...

I have a Xiaomi Note 3 Pro it cost one quarter the cost of an iPhone 6s plus. Same screen size and resolution yet is a much smaller and lighter phone. It looks a lot better too, no ugly antenna lines or bulging cameras. The fingerprint scanner is faster than the iPhone and the battery life far better and recharges quicker too. It is only slightly slower overall and not noticeable, but with a little customisation ends up far faster in real use. It has proved more reliable and robust than any iPhone I have used and feels better in the hand and pocket. The Mi5 is faster and even higher specced, so it seems you have never used a Xiaomo. The S7 is a better phone yes but for the price Xiaomi phones match or beat many more expensive phones.. (Posts: 787; Member since: 04 May 2015). posted on 04 Jun 2016, 03:01. in response to #36 Hide.

Either some people are giving opinion with poor, old or no information or it might just be prejudice. MIUI i agree leaves a lot to be desired but optimization, performance & battery are not part of that list. MIUI brings a lot of its own features & innovations to the table but also cuts down on important features which are standard on AOSP. While I think both AOSP & MIUI can learn a lot while borrowing & incorporate eachother's best elements personally I prefer one of the CM derivatives like OctOS or RR. which have taken the game to a far different level. MIUI knows its hardware & optimizes it very closely enough to get the maximum juice out of it. But also leaves a lot to be desired in the UX department if not the UI. With the UI mostly aping Apple's iOS which is actually is not suited for android is not that bad but would rather say is a much better take or adaptation of apple's UI/UX on android. I personally used to detest MIUI UX & still do but a lot less than before. But this is not a company or flavour that you can dismiss like a newbie kid on the block. Give them time to get their together. What they've done in so little time with far less resources is actually something commendable. But yeah I'll never say this to them often but they need hammering & encouragement in equal measure to deliver more, which they do..

Pros: Es el primer Xiaomi que me he comprado y ya soy fan de la marca. El teléfono tiene muy buen diseño con su enorme pantalla de 6.44 pulgadas. Todo se ve perfectamente y la resolución es buenísima. Sus 4GB de RAM y su memoria de 128GB lo hacen perfecto no solo para el uso normal del teléfono si no también para jugar. Las dos cámaras son muy buenas aunque me llevo algo de tiempo para pillar los trucos dado que el software es distinto a la mayoría de marcas que se encuentran frecuentemente en los mercados europeos. La batería aguanta un día de uso intensivo (juegos, Facebook,etc.) pero de lo contrario solo utilizándolo para llamadas o WhatsApp dura 3-4 días.Todos los sensores funcionan perfectamente. La marca actualiza regularmente el software y ofrecer a los usuarios un gran abanico de personalizaciones. El sonido es muy bueno se escucha sin ningún tipo de problema tanto la música como las llamadas y he probado muchísimas marcas asiáticas. Sin lugar a duda lo recomiendo. Cons: Llevo utilizando el teléfono bastante tiempo y de momento no me ha dado ningún problema. Estoy muy satisfecha de la compra.

While the Chinese company’s Western expansion intentions remain modest, it’s safe to expect at least a couple of new Mi devices officially launched in select European markets later this year. One of these could be a gargantuan mid-range Xiaomi Mi Max 3, tipped back in December with a “full screen” design and 5,500 mAh battery capacity.. Said colossal battery is today “confirmed” by a rock-solid source who got the chance to inspect the handset’s firmware files way ahead of the Mi Max 3’s formal announcement. We still have no reason to expect a commercial debut before summer , but if all the information revealed today is legit, that might be quite a painful wait.. Previously rumored to sport a display as large as 7 inches, with thin bezels and a 2:1 aspect ratio, the Mi Max 3 only gains confirmation on the latter subject, while exact size and resolution are unknown.. Before you get too excited, there’s a strong likelihood an image depicting an almost zero-bezel Xiaomi phone on a wireless charging stand is used for illustration purposes only. But that still means the Mi Max 3, which probably doesn’t look like that, will almost surely support Qi inductive charging.. Currently, no Xiaomi product can be charged without wires, although the Mi 7 is expected to support the technology first. Another very interesting potential Mi Max 3 feature is iris recognition, with a Snapdragon 660 SoC, dual rear camera, single front shooter and dual SIM capabilities unsurprisingly also in tow. A reasonable price point feels like a safe bet too, which could make this thing a huge box-office hit.. Android , Mi Max , Mi Max 3 , News , Rumors , Xiaomi.

Roydon Cerejo , 29 June 2016. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Mi Max sports a 6.44-inch full-HD display with Gorilla Glass 3. The phone comes with Snapdragon 650, 3GB RAM, and 32GB storage. It has good build quality and battery life but the camera is average. (Tap to see full size Xiaomi Mi Max camera samples). There was a time, not too long ago, when it was not uncommon to see people carrying 7-inch tablets around as their primary phones. As ridiculous as it looked, it was a trend that caught on and we have Samsung's affordable Tab series to thank (or blame) for that. Last year, we witnessed Lenovo attempting to get in on that action with the Phab Plus ( Review ), and today, we have Xiaomi taking a stab at this niche market with the Mi Max .. Just like Lenovo's offering, the Mi Max focuses purely on content consumption (and perhaps a bit of creation too), be it videos, games, or even apps. Given its feature set and specifications, the Mi Max can be considered a larger rendition of the Redmi Note 3 ( Review ), another very popular phone. But has Xiaomi got the formula right with the Mi Max? We've spent nearly a week with the device and here's what we think.. Look and feel It's not rocket science to make a large-screened smartphone, but the ability to achieve a balance between size, weight, and ergonomics is what sets the good ones apart. The Mi Max features a 6.44-inch full-HD display with Gorilla Glass 3 and the company's proprietary Sunlight Display tech for better outdoor legibility. Make no mistake, this screen is massive, and the Mi Max manages to make even an iPhone 6 Plus ( Review ) look small in comparison. However, Xiaomi tries to make up for this by trimming the side bezels and space above and below the display, except for what's absolutely needed. The front glass is also slightly rounded, thereby avoiding any sharp edges.. The Mi Max is fairly slim at 7.5mm and there are chamfered edges along the metal body. The volume and power buttons are placed on the right and work well, with good tactile feedback. The hybrid SIM tray sits on the left. You can either have two SIM cards or one SIM and a microSD card (up to 128GB).. The mono-speaker is placed at the bottom, along with the Micro-USB port, while the headphones socket and infrared emitter are on the top. The metal surface makes the phone quite slippery, so getting a rubber case wouldn't be a bad idea.. Around back, we have the primary camera, dual-tone LED flash, and fingerprint sensor. The metal rim around the camera juts out a bit but we didn't encounter any major scuffing during our usage. The Mi Max is a heavy phone at 203 grams but honestly, it's hard to tell when you hold it. Single-handed use for typing is quite difficult as you have to juggle the phone around.. It's not an easy phone to live with and even after a week, we found ourselves struggling to cope with its sheer size during daily commutes. It's also a task stuffing it in a pocket. Trousers are manageable but good luck trying to get it all the way into your jeans pocket. The Mi Max is sure to grab a lot of attention, not only because of its size but also because it looks premium and well-built.. Our test unit came with a charger, cable, some instruction leaflets, and a SIM ejector tool.. Specifications and software The Xiaomi Mi Max is powered by the tried and tested hexa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 SoC, 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage. The company plans to launch a higher-end variant soon which will have an octa-core Snapdragon 652 SoC, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Other specifications include dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, USB OTG, 4G with VoLTE, and FM radio. In terms of software, the Mi Max runs on a customised version of Android Marshmallow called MIUI 7 (tested on v7.5.3.0), which is similar to what we've seen before on the Mi 5 ( Review ). Some features of Marshmallow like Now on Tap aren't currently present but Xiaomi tells us that it is the works and will be added soon. In the coming months, the phone will also be upgradeable to MIUI 8. In order to make it easier to perform simple tasks like typing, the Mi Max comes with a 'One-handed mode' in the settings menu, which shrinks the contents of the display down to either 4.5-inches, 4-inches or 3.5-inches. You can perform this action by simply swiping left or right on the capacitive buttons for shrinking it down or resetting it back to normal. The screen shrinks down to either one of bottom corners of the display which makes everything more accessible, but it's still a bit of a balancing act due to the size and weight of the phone.. Another feature called 'Shortcut menu' or 'Quick ball' lets you assign five shortcuts to either a function or an app to a floating onscreen ball, which can be accessed anywhere including the home screen. It looks similar to the iPhone's AssitiveTouch feature and can be placed anywhere along the edge of the display. You can prevent it from showing up in certain apps too if you wish. It's a handy feature, especially for going back a page or the homescreen as you don't have to worry about reaching the capacitive buttons.. You get the standard fare of pre-installed apps like Security for checking data usage, cleaning up junk files, etc; Themes lets you choose from a rich selection of themes and wallpapers; Mi Remote lets you control infrared appliances in your home; and there's also Mi Store where you can buy more Xiaomi products. Third party apps include Facebook, WPS Office, SwiftKey, Flipkart, and Fleksy.. Performance Our test unit's software was pretty stable so we didn't face any noticeable glitches or bugs during our usage. The operating system works smoothly and so does multitasking. On any given day, you'll likely have about 800MB of free RAM available, which is a decent amount. We found the earpiece volume a bit lower than what we'd have liked, but clarity was good. The size of the phone does make it difficult to hold when on long calls. The Snapdragon 650 SoC offers plenty of grunt for most apps and games. As an indication of gaming performance, we got a healthy 32fps in GFXbench and 18,044 points in 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited.. Xiaomi bundles its own music player which does a good job at sorting your music. You even get some audio enhancements and equalizer presets. Audio quality is good through the headphones socket, but the mono speaker, while loud, doesn't provide the best experience. What's really missing though is a good set of stereo speakers, considering the Mi Max is designed for media consumption. The large display is great for watching video content, and this phone also handles 4K videos. Brightness levels are good although the colours need a bit of tweaking as they appear a bit too saturated by default.. Coming to the cameras, we have a 16-megapixel sensor on the rear, which is capable of 4K video recording. The 5-megapixel camera in the front can record up to 720p video. The rear camera also gets phase detection autofocus (PDAF), which works well under most lighting conditions. Landscapes and macro shots captured in daylight exhibit good detail, but the app tends to over-sharpen objects in focus which causes slight jagged edges. This is more noticeable once you crop or zoom in to a photo. The front camera pulls off some decent selfies, provided the lighting is good.. The quality of recorded video is good, even in low light. Slow-motion and time lapse video modes are also present. The camera app offers different shooting modes, including a Manual mode which lets you adjust shutter speed, ISO, white balance and focus. Focusing is quick with very little shutter lag. However, indoor and low-light shots are quite average, something we observed with the Redmi Note 3 too.. Battery life The Mi Max is blessed with a large battery - 4850mAh to be precise - which easily lasts for nearly two days of active use. In our video loop test, we managed to go 21 hours and 11 minutes before the phone powered itself down, which is excellent. The Mi Max also ships with a 10W power adapter to speed up the charging process.. Verdict It's safe to say that the Mi Max is yet another solid offering from Xiaomi, only this time, it's targeted at a rather niche market. There could be some demand for phones with enormous displays, and now buyers have a decent option. The Mi Max could potentially inject new life into this segment as it's a very good all-rounder. Its size is a subjective matter, as many people don't make a lot of voice calls, but do like watching movies and reading books. A device such as this could eliminate the need to use a separate phone and tablet, at home and also while traveling or commuting.. The phone has very good build quality, a good display, excellent battery life and snappy performance. Camera quality isn't the best and we would really have liked stereo speakers on a device geared for media consumption. This isn't going to be the easiest device to live with for many people, but if you like the idea of tablet-sized smartphones, the Mi Max is currently the best option in its price class..

Tesla's electric trucks may be more cost-effective than expected. Xiaomi's Mi Max phone has a huge display and a big battery. It's the company's biggest phone to date.. Xiaomi's next smartphone is a giant, dwarfing even its Mi Note and Mi Note Pro phablets in size. The new Mi Max comes with a 6.44-inch display and a beefy 4,850mAh battery -- which is both welcome and necessary, given the number of pixels you'll be pushing around every day. It's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 or 652 processor, as well as 4GB or 3GB of RAM, and 32GB or 128GB of internal storage. The two chipset choices are intriguing -- most flagships, such as the Galaxy S7 , are using the Snapdragon 820, leaving the 652 to mid-range devices like the LG G5 SE .. The design is eloquent, if a little by the numbers. It has a smooth, metal body with two faint antenna lines and the Mi logo etched on the back. It'll be available in silver, gold or dark grey -- the standard color set for a smartphone these days -- when it goes on sale in China next week.. The new phone also coincides with the launch of MIUI 8, the latest version of Xiaomi's custom Android skin. It's a clean, colorful take with a few new software additions, such as a reworked gallery app and calculator. MIUI 8 also introduces the ability to "split" a phone into two separate accounts, with a different passcode lock, home screen and apps. You can also "clone" apps which don't provide intuitive account switching. That means you can set up two versions of the same app, both with a separate login, and bounce between them using the home screen or Xiaomi's app switcher.. Xiaomi's Mi Max comes with a fingerprint sensor for security and convenient unlocking. On the back, you'll find a 16-megapixel camera, while the front is equipped with a 5-megapixel selfie snapper, complete with a wide-angle lens. None of this sounds too extraordinary until you consider the starting price: 1,499 RMB ($230). That'll net you the lower-specced option with the Snapdragon 650, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Spend 1,699 RMB ($261) instead and you'll be upgraded to the Snapdragon 652 and 64GB of storage; the top option, which runs for 1,999 RMB ($307), ups the RAM to 4GB and the onboard storage to 128GB.. All three option are cheaper than what the Mi Note and Mi Note Pro sold for in 2015. Those devices are slightly smaller, however, with a 5.7-inch display and some specs that, even by today's standards, are pretty competitive (they run on a Snapdragon 810, with the option of either 3GB or 4GB of RAM). The Mi Max, then, is likely to be a complimentary device, rather than a direct replacement. It will also sit alongside the Mi 5 , Xiaomi's new flagship announced at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona..

Phone is good but Mi service centre in kamla nagar is the worst, i dropped the phone and encountered issues in phone and went to kamla nagar centre for getting it fixed. but there was a huge line with very slow service. i reached there at 5, waited 1.5 hours and at 6.30 they said systems stopped working as office hours were completed. i went there next day again taking half day from office in morning hour to avoid rush but now again it took long for my turn as one of the guys there hardly works for even half time.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars ... 5 star rating had it not been for its pretty weak body. Colour: Dark Grey | Size: 32 GB | Verified Purchase. I would have given it 5 star rating had it not been for its pretty weak body. 1.8 GHz processor is very fast.... The major con of this phone is that IT IS NOT DURABLE. If it falls down once , it's a goner. The screen is really fragile and it doesn't come with gorilla glass.... Even screen guard protection won't help it. So if you are a clumsy user, make sure you don't make this fall. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars If you want a massive screen and battery, this is the phone to get - with obsolete software. Colour: Silver | Size: 32 GB | Verified Purchase. Exactly what I was looking for - big (massive) screen, superb battery life and regular software OTA updates. After the disaster that was the Asus Zenfone 2 (a horrible phone with obsolete software and rotten battery+UI, which I ended up giving away to my servant) the Mi Max has been a major hardware and software improvement. Removed two stars - now 2/5 Xiaomi doesnt upgrade the software on its phones in a timely fashion. My phone is still running TWO year old software (Android M) even though now there are phones with Android O available..

Let’s take aside the physical dimensions of the device and judge the Mi Max for everything else:. Xiaomi has been riding waves of success in the Indian market, with very successful products like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 and other disruptors like the Mi 5 .. We reviewed the Redmi Note 3 Snapdragon 650 variant. recently, and the phone left us mightily impressed in a product segment that sees some of the. heaviest, most competitive price wars in the market today. With the Mi Max, Xiaomi is pitching the innards of the Redmi Note 3 in a product segment that sees virtually no competition from all the major OEMs.. Can the Mi Max fill in a rare bracket. with a value that none can top, if they dared to try at all?. In this review, we’ll take an in-depth dive into the. Rather than listing specs and talking about how the experience felt, this feature attempts to provide a thorough look with contents relevant to our reader base. At XDA, our reviews are not meant to tell a user whether a phone is worth buying or not — instead, we try to lend you the phone through our words and help you come to the decision by yourself. Before getting started, let’s get the specification sheet out of the way:. Our review unit is the base Snapdragon 650 variant with 3GB of RAM.. The Mi Max is a device whose first impressions primarily revolve around one core aspect of the device: it’s physical dimensions. The device is huge, if you take the average smartphone size in the market as the point of comparison. Most of this hulking body is comprised by a. 6.44″ display, as the device boasts of a very impressive 74.8% screen-to-body ratio. For comparison, the OnePlus 3 has a screen-to-body ratio of 73.1%, while the Nexus 6P goes down further to 71.4% and the Redmi Note 3 is up at 72.4%. The bezels on the device are quite reserved, and we’ll touch on this in a bit.. Once you do look past the size of the device, you’ll notice that the design language on the Mi Max is similar to the one found on Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 3, but there is a separate sense of personal identity to the Mi Max.. The Redmi Note 3 sported a single-piece metallic back and side frames, with plastic caps on the top and bottom, and the Mi Max is identical in that regard. But the Max has much more of a brick-like appearance to it, as there are more flat edges than rounded ones. The side frame of the device is flat with thin chamfers on both sides. Where the chamfer ends on the back, the device curves gently to meet the mostly-flat back. The end result is a device that honestly feels like a sheet of metal. The slight curves on the side edges do help a bit in holding, but you’d still be using up most of your hand in making sure you have a decent grip on the device, so the gains are marginal.. The curves do give the device an illusion of being thinner that it actually is. At 7.5mm in thickness, the Mi Max is just 0.1 mm thicker than the OnePlus 3. The numeric figure and the perceived thinness of the phone is astounding when you consider that there is a healthy 4,850 mAh battery inside. The weight of the device, at a good 203 g courtesy of the aforementioned battery, felt a bit disconcerting at first because of how thin the device looks. I am used to holding heavy devices, with the Elephone P8000 that I reviewed coming in at the same 203 g for a 5.5″ display device. But the weight distribution on this one threw me off and took a bit of time to grow acclimatized to. The device does not feel unevenly. chunky, but evenly-weighted across the entire physical dimension which in turn is pretty expansive. So if you have the device rested on your palm, you may get the sensation that the phone would topple over (but it didn’t thankfully).. The Mi Max has curved sides and is quite thin. Notice the 3.5mm jack for an estimate on thickness. Moving on to the individual elements of design on the phone, the front of the phone is rightfully dominated by the display. The earpiece is up at the top, flanked by the identical holes on either side — one houses the proximity sensor and the ambient sensor, the other the front camera. On my white color variant, there’s a good sense of symmetry on the front of the device that Xiaomi obviously intended, which becomes apparent when the notification LED lights up from below the colored pane, instead of having its own uncolored circle. The bottom of the device sports the capacitive buttons (with backlight support) for UI navigation. Curiously, the buttons on the sides are closer to the central axis instead of being towards their respective corners. This is presumably to help in reachability in case you could use the device one-handed.. The back of the Mi Max is largely barren. There’s the Xiaomi logo towards the bottom. The fingerprint sensor is towards the top, while the rear camera and the dual-tone flash occupy the upper-left corner. The placement of the fingerprint sensor is a minus point for the device — the sensor itself works wonderfully, but it is placed poorly for a device that wasn’t ever going to be easy to use with one hand. It would have worked much, much more painlessly had it been placed a tad bit lower at points where it would be easier to access for people with medium sized hands.. Better, a front fingerprint sensor like on the Xiaomi Mi 5 would have worked a lot better than a rear fingerprint sensor. If on the front, you wouldn’t need to pick up this behemoth and wiggle it around on your palm in order to unlock it. The placement spoils the convenience aspect of the fingerprint sensor, and I was left wondering if I really needed a fingerprint sensor with such hassles. This particular experience is in stark contrast to the Redmi Note 3 and other phones that I have reviewed, where the sensor was placed perfectly for their use cases.. The left side of the device is devoid of any buttons, but houses the hybrid SIM tray. The top of the device sports the 3.5mm earphone jack on the left, the IR blaster and the secondary microphone hole. The right of the device is home to the volume rocker and the power button. The power button was within thumb’s reach for me, but the same could not be said about the entire volume rocker. The response on the buttons was excellent however, and there is no room for any wiggle. The bottom of the device has symmetrical holes for the speaker grille, but only the right side houses the speaker. The primary microphone is likely hidden on the left hand side holes. The micro-USB port occupies the middle position between the two ends.. There isn’t too much to complain about the design aspect of the Mi Max which isn’t directly a consequence of the phone being large (including my complain on the fingerprint sensor within this). While the device feels like it could bend and snap, it did not when I gave it slight tugs. The thinness of the device and its height and width may give the impression that the phone might be malleable , but. retained its shape throughout my usage. Even when placed in my front thigh pockets in my jeans, the phone survived with no deformities to its shape or any sort of bends. Due to the sheer size of the phone, it does stick out from jeans and may cause you discomfort if you tried to bend at the waist. itself was as strong as phones could be, and there was no bend-gate issues with me so far.. It’s not all flowers though, because I did have one complaint with the phone that wasn’t about its size: black bezel borders make an appearance on this phone too. There’s a thin back strip running all around the display, giving the screen a framed appearance when the screen is on; and an illusion of absolute minimal bezel when it isn’t. What’s most annoying about this is that the actual bezels (or more appropriately, the lack thereof) on this device are really damn impressive — we even praised the awesome 74.8% screen-to-body ratio of the device in the starting paragraphs! Considering that people who would buy this device would be heavy media consumers to appreciate such a large screen, the presence of the black bezel border is befuddling since it does nothing but distract. I even wished there was more bezel on the device to aid in gripping, but I sorely wished that it wasn’t a different color than the rest of the front. The Xiaomi Redmi Pro has bezels on its marketing materials so far, so this trend might be on its way out.. When OEMs insist on two different colors on the front, giving us the Black Bezel Border. Overall, the theme of the design on the Mi Max is that you need to know firsthand that a large screen is your first priority. Users who buy this device based on the internal specs and assume that they can get used to the 6.44″ screen will have a steep learning curve as they figure out how to handle the phone without dropping it. The phone is big, unapologetically and unabashedly. It’s the main selling point, and there’s no way to get around it. To appreciate the phone properly, you need to have big hands and physically big pockets (or a purse) because the phone is certainly not for everybody. I am 6′ in height, and can consider my hands to be medium sized and I certainly had issues while handling this Hulk of a phone. Using it one handed was an impossibility, and having it in my pocket and running was a difficulty. But, if you like it big, then the Mi Max is the way to go with no regrets. It’s a top notch Xiaomi device with excellent build quality and a premium feel that scores above its price level.. The Xiaomi Mi Max runs on Xiaomi’s proprietary and closed-source skin, MIUI. On its Chinese launch, the device was promised to be running on MIUI 8 based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. But considering that MIUI 8 continued to remain in Beta for a long time after the release of the device, we can’t 100% stand by this claim.. The Indian variant of the device was released with MIUI 7, but based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Our device did go into a random bootloop for reasons still unknown, but we were able to fix it with the necessary files from Xiaomi. As a result, our review unit runs on MIUI 7.5.6.0 (MBCMIDE) on Android 6.0.1.. Wait, both MIUI 7 and MIUI 8 run on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow?. You see, the version of Android remains unaffected by the version of MIUI. So you can have any number of combinations with Android versions and MIUI versions, since updates for MIUI run independent of the Android version.. So there are Xiaomi devices that received the MIUI 7 update, but still continue to remain stuck on Android 4.4 Kitkat (Redmi 2 Prime), while some like this Mi Max are on Android 6.0.1 on the same MIUI 7. And then, MIUI 8 will arrive on Android 6.0.1 for the Mi Max. [A “trick” to recognize the Android version in the Stable MIUI ROMs with a simple glance is to see the starting alphabet for the builds — Kxxxxxx is Kitkat, Lxxxxxx is Lollipop, Mxxxxxx is Marshmallow].. So how disparate are features then? One would assume that the same MIUI version (MIUI 7) on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow (Mi Max) would have a lot of difference than on Android 5.1 Lollipop (Redmi Note 3). But that is not the case. So similar is the experience of MIUI 7 on the Mi Max with the Redmi Note 3, that my previous indepth review of MIUI 7 stands applicable to the experience on the Mi Max as well. I will note down any differences or additional features in this review, along with some of my qualms with MIUI not covered in the previous review. But for the most part, it’s the same experience.. One of the biggest negatives that I found with my MIUI 7 experience was how Permission Management is made unnecessarily complex to access. Permission management was not a very accessible feature in Android 5.1, so Xiaomi’s implementation could be excused in that instance since they practically made available to every user a feature that wasn’t intended to exist in that Android version. But with Android 6.0.1 embracing Permission Management with open arms, Xiaomi’s stagnation with the same way of accessing these permissions make things confusing, difficult and unnecessary.. In AOSP Android 6.0.1, a user needs to navigate to Settings > Apps and then click on any app to see the permissions it has. A click on the permissions options will then reveal a switch to deny permissions if the user deems necessary. This is management on individual app basis. AOSP also had you covered in case you wanted to control permissions on individual permission basis. All you need to do is to go to Settings > Apps, and then tap the gear icon on the right corner. This opens up a page where you select App Permissions, and then be treated to a list of different categories of permissions along with. number of apps installed that have access to that permission. Both these approaches have a common origin in Settings > Apps, and feel familiar to anyone used to AOSP.. Click on Gear in Settings -> Apps. See Permissions sorted on Permission basis. Toggle Apps with Access to that Permission. But on MIUI 7 (irrespective of Android 5.1 or 6.0), going through Settings > Installed Apps brings up an app list. Once you select an app, you can scroll down to the Permission Manager and click on it… and a blank page opens. This is where App specific permission management should exist, but for some reason, it doesn’t. Similarly, the gear icon in Settings > Installed Apps does nothing in relation to Permission Management.. So if you do need to access the Permission Manager, you need to find the Security app and click on the Permissions option and then again on Permissions to see the different categories of Permissions. It’s the same menu you’d find on AOSP, and it works about the same way. But it isn’t present where you’d expect it to ordinarily be. The total permissions needed by an app can be found nowhere in the menu — so if you wanted to check if any app was trying to reach up too high unnecessarily, you can’t.. Example of the behavior on MIUI 7:. Scrolling down towards permissions in specific app. Gear icon behavior in Settings -> Installed Apps. Outside of this, I did not find anything that felt off to me and that wasn’t noted previously. The MIUI 7 build on the Mi Max improved and added a few features too. For example, the multitasking screen now defaults to open previews instead of just simple screens. There’s also Double-Tap-to-Wake functionality on the Max, and I really appreciated this addition as it meant that I could go without trying to reach the power button when waking up the device.. There’s also some features that although may have had good intentions, did not really work out for me in terms of convenience but your personal mileage may vary. First up is the Quick Ball functionality, which is very similar to the Assistive Touch functionality found in iOS devices and achieves similar purpose as PIE Launcher found in custom ROMs. You can move the “ball” around to any part of the screen as a floating button, and you can reconfigure the options within for commonly used actions, settings and even apps.. Double Tap to Wake, built-into stock ROM. Another feature to re-iterate here owing to the large screen is the One-Handed functionality. You can resize the contents of the display to fit within smaller display diagonals anchored at either corner. If you have marginal difficulties in reaching parts of the screen, this feature can help you out in those pinchy moments. But if the phone felt too large for you and you have difficulty handling the physical dimensions eitherways (as was my case), this would do nothing for you.. To wrap things up, MIUI 7 on the Xiaomi Mi Max runs wonderfully overall. MIUI always has been a very different experience when compared to AOSP, and it continues to be. There definitely is a learning curve to it, and combined with the learning curve that is the Mi Max itself (in terms of handling), the experience might be overwhelming to the average Android user if they. But there’s nothing in MIUI that would denote a sluggish or a sub-par Android experience. A lot of the credit for this goes to the Snapdragon 650 SoC and the 3GB of RAM, but MIUI does keep things in check for an Android skin that does deep modifications.. If the Redmi Note 3 (Snapdragon variant) set any precedent for performance, it’s that you don’t need to be a flagship to deliver some stellar. The phone went on to beat several known names in the low end right up to the mid end, and was even deemed to be better in performance than a few yesteryear flagships. The Snapdragon 650 SoC is no joke, and the combination of the Quad-core Cortex-A53 cluster clocked at 1.4GHz with the Dual-core Cortex-A72 cluster at 1.8GHz accommodates a wide variety of use cases with no compromises. The Snapdragon 652 ups the ante by adding in another two Cortex-A72 cores in the performance cluster. Mi Max starts off the basic variant with the Snapdragon 650 SoC and moves on to the reportedly-better Snapdragon 652 in the higher variants, so the device. should be on course to follow along in the footsteps of the Redmi Note 3 and even kick things up a notch.. The Mi Max is a niche product in the >6″ space, so there’s virtually no competition to the device around its own screen size. We can find other phones if we expand our search to include 6″ devices, but all of these devices belong to the upper end of the market, such as the Huawei Mate 8 , ASUS ZenFone 3 Ultra (6.8″), Sony Xperia XA Ultra and the Samsung Galaxy A9 Pro. The closest in pricing is the 6″ ZTE Max Pro which was just released a while ago. Because of all of these, it is difficult to compare the Mi Max with similar devices, and so, most of its comparison would have to be SoC-centric rather than competition-centric.. As demonstrated on the Redmi Note 3, daily average tasks are just a breeze for the Snapdragon 650 and its Quad Core Cortex-A53 setups, and the same holds true for the Mi Max as well. Heavier tasks, such as intense gaming, also get done well with the Dual Core Cortex-A72’s. Most consumers would find no difference between the performance on the Mi Max and a flagship, because the Snapdragon 650 leaves very little room for doubt to creep in. On the value front, due to the higher cost of the device, it isn’t as performace-per-buck as the Redmi Note 3, but Xiaomi’s pricing ensures that the phone still trumps ahead in the competition on that end as well. My complaints with multitasking on MIUI were largely offset in this case by the additional 1GB of RAM over the Redmi Note 3 unit I reviewed, and I find that I have virtually nothing to complain about in the performance department. It works and it works well, what can I say.. Is it flagship grade performance based on the benchmark numbers? No. The benchmarks can only be destroyed by true flagships, like the OnePlus 3. The Mi Max is not a flagship, and it never pretends to be one. Scoring and comparison on the basis of pure numbers will put the device behind several Snapdragon 820-totting devices of 2016 which is no surprise. But Qualcomm has seriously upped the game for itself in 2016 after a disappointing 2015, so the Snapdragon 650 is still one of the best bets in the mid-end, upped only by the Snapdragon 652. It performs higher theoretically than most yesteryear’s flagships and comes up above current competition from mid-ends from Mediatek.. For the price tag of the phone, this is the best SoC you can get, hands-down. heavy lifting with your device, it might be a better idea in the long run to opt for the Snapdragon 652 with its two additional Cortex-A72 cores in the performance cluster, providing that extra oomph when you need to stretch the limits. For most practical purposes though, the Snapdragon 650 works as good as the Snapdragon 652 and might be a better deal based on its lower price value (since the GPU is also the same on both).. With regard to thermals, the Mi Max does come out behind the Redmi Note 3 (which was a thermal pleasure). Running the extensive GFXBench benchmark made the device get a bit warm, and that is the extent till which the device heats up. device never gets beyond slightly warm even with. other gaming scenarios such as NFS No Limits or FIFA 16 or Pokemon GO for that matter. Repeated benchmarking under these slightly above-ordinary temperatures reveals no signs whatsoever for aggressive thermal. throttling, so this slight increase in temperatures is. I even tried to “heat” the device by running these tests under heavy insulation, but the scores showed only a marginal variance with the device returning to its normal temperatures fairly quickly.. For the GPU, the Mi Max bears the Adreno 510 on both the Snapdragon 650 and the Snapdragon 652 variants. For the mid end where most screens still opt in for 1080p resolutions or lower, the GPU works very well. Since GPU performance is tied closely with the resolution of the display rather than its size, the 6.44″ Mi Max works just as well with the Adreno 510 as the 5.5″ Redmi Note 3 did; both being FHD displays.. Once again, the Snapdragon 650 continues its winning streak with the Mi Max, as it demonstrates that gaming is certainly not even near its weak point. Games work remarkably well, whether they are casual titles like Clash Royale or whether they involve heavy-lifting like Modern Combat 5. Again, it’s deja-vu, as the Max remains well within comfortable heat limits even under intense and prolonged sessions and poses no threat of. interrupting your gaming fun with high temperatures of any sort. Once (or more probably, “if”) you get used to handling the dimensions and weight of the device, you will easily get lost within the gaming experience for hours at end — it’s smooth, cool to touch, jank-free and generally impressive.. On titles with softer graphics like NFS: No Limits and FIFA 16, the Mi Max maintained a steady 30fps during gameplay. With Asphalt 8 as well, the game stuck around on the 30fps cap despite being run on highest settings. With heavy graphics game like Dead Trigger 2, the Mi Max did fall behind as it failed to maintain a steady 60fps. While our benchmark app could not properly get an average, the fps hovered within the 50-60 range during gameplay.. The biggest complaint I had with the Redmi Note 3 that stopped from making it my daily driver was the paltry amount of RAM on the device. The 2GB of RAM on the base variant made multi-tasking a nightmare — apps closed if you exited them and opened anything else. One simply could not have any scope of decent multi tasking — games and the music player did not go together well, nor did YouTube and IM apps. After a while, you thank your stars that Notes and Calculator can at least co-exist. MIUI being a heavy and intensive OS also was as much to blame as the lack of physical capacity.. With the Mi Max, things are off to a much better start. The base variant of the Mi Max starts off with a 3GB LPDDR3 RAM variant while the top guy goes for 4GB RAM. The difference that an additional GB of RAM makes on MIUI can be felt as soon as you start playing around with the device. It now becomes practical to lock popular apps like IM into memory, and you can leave apps and return back to the last position a day later. It’s a whole different experience, which makes the Mi Max work towards providing a superior multitasking functionality than its closest brother. With the 4GB variant, I reckon things would be much more future proof seeing that our needs are evolving, not to mention the eventual multi-window updates to Android and MIUI.. But, the 3GB of RAM inside the Mi Max is still not neck-to-neck. with the 3GB of RAM in my other AOSP-based devices. Granted, it is a very noticeable improvement from the 2GB of the Redmi Note 3 base variant, but pure numbers paint a rosy picture of the ground reality. If one goes by the number of apps that can be held in memory, the Mi Max lags out behind the pack mostly because of MIUI and its stock functionality. Most consumers will not notice it, but if you are someone who pushes your phone to its limits often, you will find that the device is not future-proof. For everyday tasks, the Mi Max works just as well as other phones. Also, there are settings inside MIUI that alter multitasking behavior, but we have stuck to the defaults assuming that most normal consumers would not know about these.. When it comes to storage, the Mi Max is back on track to doing things right. The internal storage is good in terms of speed and for its price range, with the Mi Max improving on the scores of the Redmi Note 3. It does not compete with the quick storage solutions seen in flagships that employ UFS 2.0, but I wouldn’t hold that against this device since it never meant to compete in that space. Storage space starts off at a healthy 32GB on the base variant, and kicks it out of the park with 128GB on the higher variant, so most of its target audience wouldn’t likely need an external card. But if they do, the Mi Max does come with microSD support, but you have to choose between using the card or the SIM card as the phone uses a hybrid slot for the same.. Also to note, the Xiaomi Mi Max does not support adoptable storage. With the base variant starting off at 32GB, this will be less of an issue. But we would rather have the option and not use it instead of having no choice at all.. Real world performance of the Mi Max is top notch, despite the existence of MIUI which can be considered both, a feature and a limitation in the same vein. Yes, the skin is heavy, but its is heavily optimized for the hardware. Because of this, there are no lags or stutters within MIUI or while using the phone. Credit also goes to the hardware itself, as the Snapdragon 650 are some trusty shoulders to lean on for an experience that is indistinguishable from phones twice the price.. App opening speeds on the Mi Max are impressive considering that this is a device that is barely a mid-ranger. Again, this is no flagship, but the difference between this and a flagship does no justice to the price gap between the two. For example, Discomark clocked in an impressive 2.368s for opening through Chrome, Gmail, Play Store and Hangouts from cold boot states. This is behind the super-impressive 1.89s of the OnePlus 3 and the 2.057s of the HTC 10 , but isn’t too far away either. Most users would not be able to tell the difference in the speeds unless they try to accurately monitor the timings since we are talking differences in fractions of seconds for cold-booting four apps. The difference between the current top dog of Android with 6GB of RAM and Snapdragon 820 with a clean AOSP ROM and a mid ranged phone with 3GB of RAM, Snapdragon 650 and a relatively-heavy MIUI skin is 0.478 seconds for four apps combined. So my incessant harping on about the Snapdragon 650 being legit has some fair basis to it.. App Opening Speeds on the Xiaomi Mi Max. App Opening Speeds on the OnePlus 3. Thermal throttling is non-existent on the Mi Max as well. The device slightly gets warm during prolonged use, but is in no way unusable in terms of heat, nor are there any signs of slowdown.. All in all, there would be no real complaints on the performance aspect of the Mi Max. It’s another solid performer coming out of Xiaomi’s stable, and for its price, it offers very good value. Multitasking is just the area where it can still continue to improve on, and is one of those cases in Android where more physical memory might be beneficial for the future. The present is served very well, making it a second time in a row for a reviewed Xiaomi device here.. The Xiaomi Mi Max comes with a 16MP rear camera with f/2.0 aperture, along with phase detection autofocus and dual tone LED flash. Xiaomi wasn’t forthcoming with the exact details on the sensor, and the camera entries in apps like AIDA64 were blank as well. There are sporadic talks with the sensor being the same as the one on the Redmi Note 3, but outside of this, I was unable to find any concrete and verifiable information. If the sensor on the Mi Max is indeed the same Samsung ISOCELL S5K3P3, then I wouldn’t. go into the camera section with high expectations. The rear camera can shoot video at 4K @ 30fps which is an upgrade over the Redmi Note 3 which could only go upto 1080p @ 30fps. Slow-mo is available at 720p @120fps. The front is a 5MP selfie cam with f/2.0 aperture.. One recurring theme with the Mi Max camera was with over-exposure. The shots that I took often tended to be over-exposed in the brighter areas and slightly under-saturated overall. This happened a lot, with the remedy in sight being HDR mode. There are also hints of over-sharpening, but these are more apparent when you start zooming in. If the lighting is good, the camera works out OK. at best — point and shoot isn’t the forte of the device.. Point and Shoot: HDR, try #2. The camera app and response times are both very good. The UI remains the same as seen on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 as MIUI 7 retains it across devices (video of the UI from the Note 3 below). Opening the app and clicking photos can be done in a snap, but autofocus tended to take a second and half (and you can see the over-exposure in the resultant photos afterwards).. With videos, the tales of over-exposure continues. Videos are also visibly over-sharpened, moreso than the photos. Further, I did find a few quirky behaviors, one of which can be reproduced. First, during my first attempt at taking a video sample, the camera app started skipping frames very horribly after a few seconds. The uploaded video can be found here. The device was behaving normally outside of this — no heating, no thermal throttling, no rogue app eating into RAM or CPU cycles. I tried but I could not reproduce which left me scratching my head on what is happening.. The other quirky behavior with the video recording is that the camera resets the video quality every time the app is purged from memory. The default setting for videos is 720p, with steps up to 1080p and 4K. But if at all you close the camera app and the phone clears it out of memory, you have to consciously change the setting back to higher settings, lest you end up shooting videos in 720p and curse yourself later on. This is reproducible on my end.. A video sample in 4K is given below. The device does not have OIS and its dimensions and slim bezels make it difficult to maintain stability when you hold the phone at shoulder-level.. You can view additional video footage here: 1080p | 720p. Another video of over-sharpening (on 720p unfortunately, before I could realize that 4K was not enabled) can be found here .. Unfortunately, the camera review for this device has to be cut short. Weather conditions in my city (Mumbai, India) are adverse with torrential rains and water logging being a staple feature for the entirety of my review duration. The phone itself is difficult to handle physically with one hand under ordinary conditions (in landscape orientation, nonetheless), so you can imagine the difficulty when trying to balance an umbrella along with it. Coupled with water-logged streets, lack of IPX7 certification on the device and my fear of dropping the phone into water, and what you would have had would be poor excuses at me trying to judge the camera. Most of my images turned out to be poor representatives as the often overcast weather did not play well with lighting conditions, and I couldn’t decide if it was the cameras fault or of external factors (likely), thus affecting my judgement.. We’d like to revisit the camera section if external conditions become favorable in the future. My personal apology for the current situation, but alas, it could not be helped without delaying the review indefinitely.. We’ve arrived at the main talking point of the Mi Max.. While most people feel comfortable within the 5″ – 5.7″ display categories, some phone manufacturers went the extra mile when they recognized that some demand existed for phones with even bigger displays. Thus with this thought, 6″ displays became a thing. Of course Xiaomi tries to trump this up, and this 6.44″ monstrosity is Xiaomi trying to capture a market that is too niche to be mainstream. So niche is this market that are a very few phones that breach the 6″ mark. Lenovo’s Phab lineup (6.4″ – 6.8″), the LeEco Le Max (6.33″), the Honor Note 8 (6.66″) are pretty much the only competing devices, and none of them are popular enough with the mainstream audience due to its niche nature. None of these ever get mentioned alongside popular. devices, like say the Moto G3 or the OnePlus One or the Samsung Galaxy S7 and that is because the demand for such large displays is barely there.. That being said, the Mi Max gets the display right for the most part. 6.44″ IPS LCD panel with a RGB matrix is what you get for the display and Xiaomi still stuck around with the FHD 1080 x. For a display this big, Xiaomi had the opportunity to go for a QHD panel (4K would be absurd for pricing) while inflating their pricing a bit. Instead, they did not go down either the 4K or 2K route. 1080p still works very well for the Mi Max as the pixel density comes out to be 342ppi, still invisible individually to the naked eye (for most sets of eyes, at least). The result is that image is still clear and sharp, and the battery life and GPU impacts are not as high as compared to 2K. LCD is the best option for big 1080p panels , as current full HD AMOLED alternatives with their pentile pixel matrix cut down the effective resolution dramatically.. Color accuracy on the Mi Max is on point as well, with minimal saturation by default. MIUI gives you options to play around with contrast and the white balance on the Mi Max, so you can choose to increase your contrast (the default was a bit lacking as blacks felt brighter than expected) and go between warm and cool white balance.. Display brightness left us with the same experience as on the Redmi Note 3. The max brightness is bright for viewing under sunlight, and the low gets very low for your late night texting scenarios. Auto brightness was a bit slow to react however, as it took between 2-3 seconds to adapt. MIUI also annoyingly needs you to pinpoint your exact location on the brightness slider before you can slide it around, so the “adapting” part could use some work. Viewing angles on the Max are excellent and color accuracy is maintained until extreme angles. This is certainly noticeable on this phone, where the multimedia experience often becomes a semi-public affair.. Certainly, the display size is what sets the Xiaomi Mi Max worth its form factor. It’s a joy to consume media on this device, although my wrists disagree when the sessions start dragging on. A kickstand case would be recommended for people who look forward. to media consumption as the large display means that you can keep it farther away and still make everything out on the screen. It’s essentially a pocket-TV for people with large pockets. The speaker is a bit lacking (we’ll get to this in the audio section), otherwise the device would be perfect for an impromptu, casual YouTube playthrough with your crew.. Would a 2K display help the Mi Max? If there was ever a case to use a 2K display on a smartphone, it would make the most sense on something of this size. It feels like a wasted opportunity, and my opinion is personally divided on it. On one hand, a 2K display on a 6.44″ would have gains that are more noticeable than a 2K display at 5.5″. On the other, there are various other factors to keep into consideration, such as the pricing (competitively priced for early mid-range), GPU load, battery impact. For these factors, a FHD panel makes sense. Should Xiaomi have gone for a QHD display? I find myself unable to answer the “should” part, because the Mi Max is still a joy in its current state. Don’t fix what is not broken, and Xiaomi does exactly that. A 2K display could have brought in issues that would push the phone out of reach of this already niche audience, so hopefully Xiaomi has its research done right.. The Redmi Note 3 blew our collective minds off with its pure physical capacity of 4,000 mAh and an insane battery life of two days of moderate use. With the Mi Max, things are going up in the capacity department, but with the increase in screen size give a net positive increase in battery life?. The Mi Max comes in with a beefier 4,850 mAh battery. This is no “slight” increase in capacity — it’s a whole different league of its own in the number game. Just for comparison’s sake, the Moto Z comes with a 2600 mAh battery, the OnePlus 3 comes in with a 3000 mAh battery and the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 comes in with a 3500 mAh battery. Combine this beefy battery into a body that is actually pretty thin (but in contrast, heavy because of density), a processor that is quite power efficient, and a custom OS skin that does not like rogue apps running in the background. What you get is a recipe for success.. With a standard PCMark test setup, the Mi Max received a mind-blowing 8h 25mins of uninterrupted benchmark performance at maximum brightness and WiFi (and Sync) enabled all through. usage scenario (using system resources, not discrete or abstract. calculations), which makes it better (but not perfect) to determine. how much you can expect the device to last through. Within our testing, the device can easily crank out an 8 hour shift at work if all you did was play games on the device (because that is what we do at work, right?). This figure is hands down impressive, besting even the Redmi Note 3 by a decent 20 min margin despite the bigger display. Xiaomi even bested itself in one department I thought the Redmi Note 3 was an absolute boss.. down the brightness to minimum and switched off WiFi to see how long the phone can do in minimal use scenarios, the Mi Max cranked out 18 and half hours of looping benchmarks, with nay a drop in performance. This is a good 2 and a half hour improvement over the Redmi Note 3 in similar situations.. Combined, both of these tests give us a good range of battery life to expect from the device. Depending on your use case, you can vary from 8.5 hours of screen on time to up to 18.5 hours. Throw in some quality standby times and I wouldn’t not believe someone if they said they can get 3 days without a charge on the Mi Max. During my own use case where I charge my device on a daily basis, I can find myself not dropping below 60% irrespective of how much I use the device. Even heavy Pokemon GO sessions, while not very comfortable ergonomically, did not disappoint in the slightest in terms of battery dropout. You can go out for 4 hours and still come back with enough juice to last you through the rest of the day. What makes this even more impressive is that the SoC is not an entirely power-saving SoC, so this extended performance consisted of no-compromises from the phone — no lags, no abnormal stutters, just top notch performance.. If you are someone that looks. for insane battery life and performance that can help you enjoy that much life, the Mi Max will spoil you to the point where everyone else is simply not good enough. I went in with high expectations, and still got blown away.. With a battery of this size, charging all of it was expected to be a downside and it is. remain quite mum on whether the device sports Quick Charging of any sorts. The official charger in the box is a simple Quick Charge 1.0 brick with 5V at 2A for 10W, but this is likely to keep the price of the device down and to increase sale of accessories (common market practice). I did have a Quick Charge 2.0 charger at hand, so most of my results are based off that. We would recommend users to stick to the official charging accessories only, for their own safety.. With my QC 2.0 charger which can do a maximum of 12V at 1.25A for 15W, the Mi Max took around 3 hours and 40 mins on an average to go from a. The slow charging times are not really “slow” per se, even though the percentage values make it appear so. That is because the huge 4,800 mAh battery will often be sufficient even at 50% of the charge. An hour of charging from 0% will give you around 33% battery, which can last you through the day if you do light usage. 50% battery is reached around the 1hr 30min mark, and the device really starts tapering off after 85% since you can reach that much in 2 hours 40 mins but still take another hour to reach the remaining 15%. Do you really need to reach 100% battery? The answer is no, a firm one at that. The heaviest of human use cases would do just fine with 85% battery on this behemoth to last them through a day.. Does the Mi Max support Quick Charge 3.0? This remains a talked after topic, but there is little information officially from Xiaomi in that regards. Qualcomm’s official list of devices that support QC 3.0 does include the Mi Max, and other users on the Mi Forums have reported varying success on trying out QC 3.0 certified chargers to bring down the charging time to 1 and a half hours, but we would not recommend users to use unofficial charging accessories. Even though close to 4 hours in charging time is a lot, you really do not need 2-3 days of battery life if you charge your phone daily (but it is a nice backup option to have and not carry around a powerbank for).. Battery life was one of my favorite plus points on the device, but battery testing made me waste so much time. Not only is the phone unkillable, it takes as much time to charge up, so any error meant that I had to endure this extraneous exercise all over again. The device does draw mixed feelings, as an official certification and approval from Xiaomi for Quick Charge 3.0 would have given the phone some very good specifications for battery.. The big display on the Mi Max could be have been combined with a great audio experience to make the Mi Max a truly multimedia-oriented experience. But, after a series of great runs with other parts of its hardware, the audio is that area where the Mi Max could have been better. The speaker setup on the Mi Max is comprised of a series of identically-drilled holes on the bottom mid-frame, but only the set of holes on the right hand side house the speaker.. The speakers get just about get adequately loud for a personal experience, but anything beyond that is a sub-optimal.. Since the speakers are bottom-firing, it’s not up to par. when compared to phones (or even tablets for that matter) with front facing speaker setups, but it is at least better than those on the rear. If you are in a noisy environment, you’d definitely want to find a different source for audio. Distortion is present at the highest volume levels. So at its best, the Mi Max is a device that is just there in terms of the. The earphone jack is a much better companion to the multimedia experience as the quality is what we come to expect in the price range. It is noticeably better than starter-range devices and is competitive to experiences in the mid-range. Pairing the Mi Max with a good earphone is the way to go if you plan to binge watch a few movies (but get a kickstand for the sake of your wrists). There are no earphones included in the box, as is standard in the mid ranges in the market.. For the earpiece and the microphones, the Mi Max is good and at par with every other smartphone. It works as a phone and there’s no room to complain on the quality. The phone is difficult to hold and talk for long durations, but this is a consequence of the size of the phone rather than something that is affected by the earpiece or the microphone.. The Mi Max (Snapdragon 650) is internally quite similar to the Redmi Note 3. The RN3 had decent levels of custom development, including a few recoveries, kernels and most popular custom ROMs making their way over. Due to the popularity of the device, and its size and every other factor kept in mind, the RN3 SD650 variant fared quite well honestly. The MediaTek variant of the RN3 was not as fortunate though. The bootloader unlock procedure is also something that people do not look forward to, as you need forum activity for speedy consideration.. On the whole, the RN3 is no OnePlus or Nexus, but it still does offer a good platform to tinker around in the very early price brackets of the market.. With the Mi Max, however, things do not appear as rosy. The first part that would likely impact the development scenario on the device is the niche nature of the product itself. The Mi Max cannot be considered a mainstream product, and the size of the device is definitely not for everyone. This works against the device and creates a negative feedback loop of sorts for those looking for an active dev device: the device is not popular -> fewer development projects -> fewer enthusiasts look forward to it and all over back again. Popularity of the device remains questionable with the general public, so you can expect a similar drop in the number of knowledgeable Android enthusiasts who will pick up the device (especially keeping in mind that the device does not really utilize the big screen outside of media just. That does not mean that the means to develop on the Mi Max are closed off. The device fares well when compared to other Chinese devices. With the internals of one variant of the Mi Max (hydrogen) being so similar to the RN3 (kenzo), it is easy to port over resources for this variant from the ready stuff on the RN3. The other Snapdragon 652 variant (helium) will have some initial difficulties comparatively.. The bootloader on the Mi Max is locked from what I can derive from past experiences. My device was a review device and hence had an unlocked bootloader out of the box, but this is an exception scenario and not the norm. Regular consumer devices would be having a locked bootloader. The bootloader unlock procedure, as is detailed in several areas on the MIUI forums since it is universally applied to newer Xiaomi devices, tends to take time. This is an intentional step to dissuade loading of malware by resellers, and while we hope that it was quicker, we can understand and sympathize with the needs of the average consumer trumping over those of the Android enthusiast.. Further, TWRP builds are available for both the device variants over in our Mi Max subforums. ( hydrogen | helium ).. There are a few threads that claim to allow installation of a recovery on a locked bootloader too.. With regards custom ROM development, there is an unofficial CyanogenMod 13 build floating around, but since the source is something I can not verify, this will not be linked nor advised to flash. Official CyanogenMod 13 (or an unofficial build from a trustworthy source) may come to the Mi Max eventually as I do know of one device maintainer who has the device, but there is no ETA or promises on this end.. The situation for kernel sources for the Mi Max are not yet released. But some conversations with a few developers pointed that these will come soon. Xiaomi did release the kernel sources for the RN3 kenzo, and the Mi Max will also get it since it is a Snapdragon device. The only question relates to the “when” aspect of it. Again, we hope for a speedy release.. Also to note, it is difficult to completely hard brick and kill (in the absolute sense) a recent Xiaomi device with a Snapdragon processor. I ended up bricking my RN3 several times after my review when I was just casually messing around. But every time I “bricked”, I did end up resurrecting the device. The RN3 has a final test point method for recovering from “hard bricks” (it is not a hard brick if it does not mean absolute death of the device, in my opinion). You do need to open up the device down to the motherboard, so it is not exactly a beginner-friendly step. But it exists on the Redmi Note 3 (kenzo) and a similar method also exists on the Mi Max as well.. All in all, the situation is a bit worse off when compared to the Redmi Note 3 Snapdragon 650 variant, but. the mainstream popularity of the RN3 is likely to be blamed for the headstart in the custom development scene. The paths to improvements do exist for the Mi Max — the device does have development potential and is not completely locked out or doomed in any way. It is just a matter of time and the device attracting some more developers and users for the development activity to really pick up the pace.. The Xiaomi Mi Max is an interesting device. It attempts to fit a gigantic screen in your hands, and then backs it up with some spectacular horsepower and battery life. The device then comes to you at a pocket friendly price, which is against its own pocket-unfriendly nature. The big screen is the reason why you should buy the device, and the big screen (and resultant big body) is the reason why you also shouldn’t buy the device.. Calling the Mi Max a phone would be a disservice honestly. It is a phablet, and a proud one at that. meant for people with large hands, or for those who use their devices with both their hands majority of the time. I do not fall in either of those categories, so it was difficult for me to truly love. and accept the Mi Max for what it was. Every time I picked up the device, I wished it was smaller despite its incredible screen-to-body ratio and thin bezels, which very clearly means that I am not the target audience of this device.. You get a fantastic SoC under the hood, backed up with a decent amount of storage and RAM. The GPU is a capable beast for its price, so games and other activities related to displaying content on the screen will give you no chance to complain on its performance. Thanks to the hybrid SIM slot, you can either go Dual SIM or choose a microSD card. There’s an IR Blaster on the phone, so you can also use the device as a universal remote in case you ever needed to. The device is also at a good starting point for third party development activities since the bootloader can be unlocked officially , albeit with a bit of effort.. And lastly, the very large battery makes it so that charging the phablet becomes a very passive thought process instead of a habit or a daily ritual, just like from the days of feature-phones. Having a phone that can last through a whole day of usage or two , irrespective of the definition of the words “whole day of usage” across users, is something I give bonus points towards.. But the Mi Max also has a few weak points .. Camera of the device seems to be the area where improvements can originate, as there are some flaws that become apparent early on. The display could have gone the whole QHD route, though I understand that there were reasons to not do so (and I agree with the minimal gains and their marginal nature, but that does not mean that everyone will be content with the FHD resolution display). Audio performance through the speakers could also have been better, as the current situation does not make the phablet fit for semi-public media consumption. MIUI 7 and Android 6.0 do not really utilize the screen size as much as I would have liked, but things may change for the better with MIUI 8 (or MIUI 9) on Android 7.0 Nougat whenever it lands on the device, making this slight negative to turn into a healthy positive. Charging speeds on the device are poor, but users have had varying results so I hope Xiaomi can at least point to an officially recommended charging speed, and if possible through software, improve on it.. Keeping the screen size aside, you do have to decide if you can live with all of the above pros and cons for a price tag of. ₹14,999 ($225) for the base variant which was reviewed here.. In my opinion, if it is just the internals that you are going for, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 3GB RAM variant is the no-brainer better value at. iaomi’s insane value proposition in the Redmi Note 3 leaves little room for its other devices to compete, and the near identical nature of the insides of the RN3 3GB RAM variant and the Mi Max SD650 variant obviously tips the scale in favor of the Redmi Note 3.. The Mi Max Snapdragon 652 variant with the 128GB storage and 4GB RAM will cost you. The additional GB of RAM will help keep things future proof. But the gains from the Snapdragon 652 (versus the Snapdragon 650) are not very large and are noticeable in tasking scenarios only, and since you can use a microSD card, you do need to ask the question if you really need the internal storage and the performance bump.. Now, with the above said, factor in the screen size and you get a recipe for unmatched success. The Xiaomi Mi Max is a league of its own, and there is no available competitor in the (Indian) market as of right now that can try and dethrone it from claiming the pole position in this niche market. For its price point, not only do you get a phablet, you get a pretty good deal at that. You get similar value proposition as from the Redmi Note 3, but with a bigger screen. Media consumption is generally a delight, and I loved using my device for impromptu binge watching YouTube or showing off family pics. This is where the phone shines, where it makes the most sense, and this is its real selling point — the large screen.. Should you buy the Xiaomi Mi Max?. The answer depends on if you are looking for a big phablet. If 6″ feels small to you, the Mi Max will please you. I would recommend physically holding the device once at least before making your decision since the Mi Max is a niche product and there’s a good chance you wouldn’t have experienced. If the screen size is not your priority criteria, I would recommend going for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3.. You can purchase the Xiaomi Mi Max in India from Xiaomi’s Mi Store .. The Xiaomi Mi Max was a mixed experience for me. I enjoyed it on the inside, but the device was just not meant for me. The device did open my eyes that my sweet spot for phones is 5.5″..

The Snapdragon 636 is a down-clocked 660. The maximum frequency listed in the firmware is 1.8GHz, which is below the maximum frequency of the 660’s 2.2GHz. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro features the Snapdragon 636 SoC, but within its firmware files it is listed as the Snapdragon 660.. Xiaomi’s most anticipated smartphones this year are likely their two flagship phones: the Mi Mix 2S and the Mi 7. Both will feature the latest SoC from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 845 , and are expected to launch at or soon after the upcoming Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Not everyone is a fan of purchasing expensive flagship hardware, however, and that’s why companies like Xiaomi offer many different devices at all kinds of price points. One of Xiaomi’s mid-range brands is the Mi Max series, which are known for their gargantuan battery capacities. We believe that Xiaomi will continue that trend this year with the release of a new Xiaomi Mi Max 3, for which we have exclusively obtained the firmware files for.. Back in December, a Chinese blog called. CNMO reported that the Mi Max 3 would feature an enormous 5,500 mAh battery. The report also alleged that the device would feature a 7″ 18:9 display, have dual cameras, and have either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 or the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 SoC depending on the model.. While we cannot confirm any information about the display size, the firmware files we have obtained allow us to confirm most of the other information, as well as a few new findings of our own.. The following information is based on firmware files obtained by. @FunkyHuawei , the man behind the. Huawei and Honor phones for a fee. He has provided access to these firmware files exclusively to XDA-Developers.. First off, we’ll go over the most basic specifications. According to the various build properties, the device we are looking at will launch with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 SoC. There might be a Snapdragon 630 variant, but we haven’t seen that one yet. The battery capacity is indeed 5,500 mAh , which should please any person who is interested in a device with a long battery life. We can also confirm that it will have an 18:9 display, though we can’t confirm the display resolution.. What’s most interesting about this device, however, is the fact that it may have wireless charging. Xiaomi phones have never supported Qi wireless charging before, but Xiaomi finally joined the Wireless Power Consortium late last year. The Xiaomi Mi 7 is supposedly going to be the first Xiaomi device with wireless charging capabilities, but we haven’t found any direct evidence for that yet. The Xiaomi Mi Max 3 will very likely support wireless charging , though, as we found two pieces of direct evidence for that in its firmware.. Within the MIUI Keyguard APK, we discovered strings relating to wireless charging. There are strings that tell you if charging has stopped and if so, whether it is because the device’s position has been offset from the charger base.. Furthermore, we found a help video and graphic made by Xiaomi that shows the user how to place their device on the wireless charger. The phone shown in the graphic is likely not how the Mi Max 3 will look in person, because it’s possible that the graphic is just showing off a generic device for Xiaomi’s future broad range of smartphones with wireless charging capabilities.. Next up, we were able to find out exactly what camera sensors the device will be using, thanks to a configuration file. On the rear, the device will have either an IMX363 from Sony or an S5K217+S5K5E8 Samsung dual camera setup. On the front, there will be a lone S5K4H7 from Samsung. However, it appears that the front of the device may be joined by another imaging sensor: an iris scanner.. The front auxiliary module mentioned here is the OmniVision 2281. which “leverages a 1.12-micron pixel with PureCel technology to enable accurate, reliable iris recognition for smartphones, tablets, and notebooks” according to its official page. It appears that this sensor is still in-development for the device, as the lines pertaining to it have been commented out. I don’t know if the final model of the device will have an iris scanner, but it’s clear that this is in the works. Given that this device will support wireless charging and will have a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, it makes sense for it to add iris scanning so you can quickly unlock the phone when it is sitting on a table.. Regarding the software, the firmware suggests the device is running Android 8.1 Oreo. Notably, the first API level set in the build properties was 25, which means this device started out running Android 7.1 Nougat. It’s possible that this device may launch with Android 8.1, but it’s also possible that the firmware we’re looking at is the developer ROM and that the stable release will be an older version of Android. Basically, don’t get your hopes up.. Other minor aspects we can reveal are that the device will have a dual SIM card slot, support dual SD cards, an IR blaster, LED light for notifications, audio tuned by Dirac, Qualcomm’s aptX and aptX HD Bluetooth audio codecs, but unfortunately no NFC. It will also possibly have dual speakers (though the firmware isn’t 100% clear on that), and something called a front “remosic” sensor.. If we learn more about the Xiaomi Mi Max 3, we’ll keep you updated on the XDA Portal. Until then, be sure to follow our new. It has come to our attention that the Mi Max 3 may feature the Snapdragon 636 rather than the 660, despite what the firmware says. There are two reasons for this:. Ultimately, the difference is very minor, but it’s worth mentioning in order to be accurate.. Android Oreo exclusive MIUI xiaomi xiaomi mi max Xiaomi Mi Max 2.

Display is where this new Mi Max differs from the rest as it measures a whopping 6.44 inches. The most interesting thing here is that this display has a 74.8% screen-to-body resolution which gives an immersive viewing experience.

Samsung Galaxy S9 arrives today: 5 things to know. The State of 5G: When It's Coming, How Fast It Will Be & The Sci-Fi Future It Will Enable. Samsung unveils its camera-focused Galaxy S9 handsets. A second save slot in Metal Gear Survive costs $10. Xiaomi Mi Max: The Largest Phone I've. There are plenty of large phones to choose from these days: the iPhone 7 Plus , the Galaxy Note 7 , the OnePlus 3 , and many others that feature displays at least 5.5-inches in size, which can make them a bit cumbersome to use in one hand.. But nothing compares to the Xiaomi Mi Max, a gigantic 6.4-inch smartphone/phablet that dwarfs what most people carry with them. This phone is, quite simply, ridiculously large.. While this handset's size will suit only a small fraction of phone buyers, there’s actually a lot to like about the hardware inside. For just under $250 from Gearbest , who helped us acquire this phone for testing, you’re getting a massive display, a metal body with a fingerprint sensor, a 16-megapixel rear camera, and a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 SoC. The battery inside is just as enormous as the handset, at 4,850 mAh.. Having now used (or, rather, struggled to use) the Xiaomi Mi Max for the last couple of weeks, I’ve learned a lot about what is physically required to operate a 6.4-inch handset on a daily basis. At $250 the Mi Max's price point is very attractive, but does the whole package deliver to earn our recommendation? Let’s find out.. Clearly the 6.44-inch display makes this device significantly larger than anything else I’ve used for years. It’s roughly as thick as the iPhone 6s at 7.5mm, but it’s 15mm taller and a whopping 10.4mm wider. Width is the key dimension for determining one-handed usability, and any increases on the already-wide iPhone 6s Plus can make a phone hard to operate.. The Xiaomi Mi Max (left) next to the 5.0-inch Huawei P9. The Mi Max compares even less favorably to the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which packs a 5.7-inch display in a near bezel-free body. Here the Mi Max is nearly 20mm taller and 15mm wider, leading to a phone that’s 35% larger than an already-large device. Even with a screen-to-body ratio of approximately 75%, the size of this display introduces a number of complications during regular usage.. In short, the Xiaomi Mi Max requires two hands to use.. It’s impossible to use the Mi Max in one hand. I don’t have particularly large hands, but even with some serious acrobatic work my fingers are at least an inch from reaching the upper left corner of the display. Reaching the same corner on my 5.7-inch Nexus 6P is relatively easy in comparison, and that’s a phone that most people think is reasonably large. The extra screen real estate effectively works against the Mi Max in this regard.. Being able to reach each corner of the display is critical as many smartphone applications place navigation elements or other buttons in these locations. In Gmail, for example, I am simply unable to hit the hamburger menu icon in the top left without performing a gymnastics routine with my fingers to appropriately position and grip the smartphone. While typing, attempting to hit the q, w or a keys gives my thumb a workout with all the stretching that is required.. To make matters worse, the capacitive navigation buttons below the display are hard to hit with one hand, especially the app switching button on the far left side.. Alternatively, left-handers will struggle to hit the important back button, which normally I’d criticize for being in the wrong location, but on this phone I’m glad it’s the closest to my hand.. In short, the Xiaomi Mi Max requires two hands to use. This sounds relatively trivial, but it’s not until you’re trying to use the phone on a regular basis that you discover how annoying it is. Carrying some shopping bags home from the store in one hand? Forget using the Mi Max in your other hand. Want to quickly send a message to a co-worker while sipping your morning coffee? No chance.. If you’re comfortable using such a massive handset and don’t mind being restricted to two-handed use, there’s actually a lot to like about the Mi Max's design. The phone features an excellent metal back panel that curves around the left and right edges, which makes the handset look just as good as some flagships of the past few years. The metal build also feels great in the hand, and provides good durability: for such a large phone there is barely any flex in the body.. The design is hampered somewhat by plastic sections above and below the metal. These sections attempt to imitate the color and finish of the metal but don’t look nearly as good. Luckily they are the only downside to an otherwise great mid-range smartphone design.. I appreciate the precision of the Mi Max’s design, which includes properly aligned elements such as the front camera and sensor array, and the two speaker grills along the bottom edge. I was disappointed, however, that the Mi Max doesn’t include front-facing stereo speakers, which would complement the large, media-friendly display. The speakers on this phone are okay, but their positioning could be better.. On the back of the Mi Max is a circular fingerprint sensor that’s reminiscent of the sensor on the latest Nexus smartphones. It’s positioned slightly too high for comfortable use on such a massive smartphone, though it’s reasonably fast and accurate. We’re not seeing fingerprint sensors on all $250 devices just yet, so it’s a feature that makes the Mi Max stand out from the crowd in some respects.. The Mi Max includes a micro-USB port on the bottom edge, and a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top. You’ll also find an infrared emitter along the top, which can transform this device into a universal remote. On the right hand edge are both the power and volume buttons in a comfortable location.. There’s a single removable tray on the Mi Max that can slot a micro-SIM and a nano-SIM for dual-SIM functionality, or a micro-SIM and microSD card for expandable storage. It would have been nice to see three tray spots so both dual-SIM and expandable storage functionality could be used simultaneously, but it’s nice to see Xiaomi is still thinking about extra features like this..

The aluminium and glass have a great feel to them. The first surprise of the device is its size; this was. It has a length of 173 mm and a width of 88 mm, which is much bigger than the palm of my hand.. weight of 230 g makes it difficult to use it with just one hand (although there is supposedly a. software solution, but we shall see)..

The device didn't fit in any of the pockets of my pants.. And it stuck out in my shorts too.. Depending on where you keep it,. Aside from the cumbersome shape, the Xiaomi Mi Max is a very elegant device. The aluminum rear leaves space on. for two plastic areas, which of course retains the same color. we have the fingerprint sensor in the. upper corner and the main camera with a dual-tone flash.. little square with a bevel at the corners.. The screen is definitely a peculiar size, measuring. IPS LCD Full HD screen is 1902 x 1080 pixels.. Corning Gorilla Glass 4, standard for smartphones and tablets this year..

This great phablet comes with the standard. MIUI 7.3 based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. This MIUI version in our test device. is the Global version, but the Chinese version is now available with MIUI 7.5. The good part of having a. standard global ROM is that you. install Google services, Google Play and Gmail. The bad part is that system updates are often too infrequent.. The most characteristically MIUI feature is the lack of an. menu settings has its own organizational structure. icon automatically appears on the home screen. can quickly sort applications into folders to improve its.

It also has an application called 'Security' with which you. can clean the system files that are not in use, control the use of the data rate, manage the list of blocked contacts, manage battery usage, scan for viruses and.

The Mi Max comes equipped with a Snapdragon 650 six-core processor;. two of these clock up to 1.8 GHz and the other four to 1.4 GHz. There are several models (as mentioned above). but we tested the most basic with 32 GB of internal memory and 3 GB of RAM.. The fluidity of the system is very good and I have not experienced any forced closure of applications. With videos and most games, it performs adequately.. When I played Need For Speed: No Limits on the device it was. a real pleasure in part due to the screen size.. I also noticed that I did not need to bring. the device closer than 10 centimeters from my face when I wanted to focus on the details of a video.. Benchmarks also went well, reaching 73,000 points on Antutu 6.1.4.. The speakers for the Mi Max. Behind one of the perforations in the bottom is a speaker for ambient sound..

Xiaomi Mi Max 3 leak points to 5,500 mAh battery, wireless charging and more. by Scott Adam Gordon 4 days ago. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Potential Xiaomi Mi Max 3 have been unearthed in the code of recent firmware files. Snapdragon 660 chip and 5,500 mAh battery with wireless charging functionality. It may also include an iris scanner, though it may be lacking NFC.. Details regarding the rumored Xiaomi Mi Max 3 may have been uncovered byÂ. The device had been the subject of a previous leak and firmware files obtained by XDA reaffirm some of the past speculation.. The leak suggests the device would come with an 18:9 display (likely at 7-inches), a Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 SoC and a 5,500 mAh battery with wireless charging functionalityâa first for Xiaomi.. The last leak suggested a Snapdragon 635 chip, so we’re not sure if one of these is inaccurate, or if there are two separate variants; 3 GB/64 GB and 4 GB/128 GB memory configurations were also speculated upon previously, so perhaps the Snapdragon 660 will be reserved for the higher spec model..

The front camera, on the other hand, may have iris scanning technology, based onÂ. The handset is also expected to runÂ. Android 8.1 Oreo and include a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, but it seems like it mayÂ. The inclusion of MicroSD card support, Dirac-tuned audio and Qualcommâs aptX and aptX HD Bluetooth audio codecs were also hinted at in the firmware.. Naturally, the code snippets didn’t include anything about device price or release date, but it has been rumored to cost around CNY 1,699 (roughly $265) and we expect to see it launched nearer the summer.
