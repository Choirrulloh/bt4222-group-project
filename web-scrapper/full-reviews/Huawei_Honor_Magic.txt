CNET también está disponible en español.. Abracadabra: This new 'Magic' phone knows who you are and what you want (hands-on). Huawei says that the AI on its Honor Magic handset will give it powers other phones don't have.. by January 3, 2017 4:31 PM PST. This phone 'magically' knows your face. Honor Magic specs 5-inch screen with a resolution of 2,560 by 1,440 pixels 12-megapixel dual-lens camera 8-megapixel front-facing camera Android 6.0 with Magic Live software layer 2.3GHz octa-core Huawei Kirin processor 2,900mAh battery with quick charge: 70 percent charge in 20 minutes 64GB internal storage/4GB RAM Colors: golden black, porcelain white. Plenty of companies think their phones "magically" do what you want without having to lift a finger, but Huawei backs its new Honor Magic -- the prettiest Honor phone we've seen -- with a whole lot of built-in settings you don't usually get.. The company says it's using AI to respond to physical sensors, like the proximity sensor, to make the phone know who you are, what you're doing now, and what you might want to do next.. A few examples of the Magic's powers:. You pick it up and its infrared sensors scan your face. Coupled with the fingerprint reader in the home button, it will only surface notification messages when the phone has verified it's you, so that nosy neighbors don't get to see who's pinging you or why.. If it's dark (or if you cover the ambient light sensor), the phone can surface a flashlight option on the lock screen. You can swipe to turn it on. Once you turn it off, you can't toggle it on again. Having the flashlight at your fingertips is one of those anticipate-your-needs functions, which will theoretically make it faster and easier to find and use.. I haven't had a chance to see this in action, but another feature is where GPS meets your calendar and other apps to pull up stuff you need to reference at a pertinent moment. For example, your tracking number should surface on screen when you get to the post office, or perhaps your boarding pass pops into view when you arrive at the airport.. Huawei also points out some capabilities that seem like rebranded features from Google Now on Android, like pressing and holding the home screen button to find out more information about a topic or place (Huawei calls this "deep think"). On the whole, though, we haven't seen sensors programmed to quite this extent -- there's an entire submenu dedicated to apps and services that the Magic can tap into, anything from flights and taxi information to streaming entertainment.. The phone's selling in China right now, but it isn't clear how much integration we'll see carry over into other countries where the Honor Magic could go on sale..

Tesla's electric trucks may be more cost-effective than expected. Honor Magic tucks Huawei's latest smarts into a slab of glass. Dual-lens camera, curved display, faster charging, contextually-aware assistant and more.. Huawei is probably best known for its Leica-branded smartphones aimed at high-end users, but its e-commerce brand Honor has also been busy entertaining affordable markets with some surprisingly nice devices -- namely the 8 and the Note 8. To wrap up the year, today the company announced the Honor Magic to showcase some of its latest goodies. "This is an experimental product of ours," said Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei's Consumer Business Group. "This concept phone will help us pre-evaluate uncertain future technologies." In a nutshell, the Magic is a mix of fresh design, faster charging tech, smarter assistant and interesting improvements on other aspects of user experience.. Gallery: Honor Magic hands-on | 27 Photos. First and foremost, the device comes with a nice 5.09-inch AMOLED curved display with QHD resolution (577 ppi), and Honor took one step further by also curving the top side. These three round edges are mirrored to the phone's glass back, so if it weren't for the metallic chin and mid-frame, the Magic would resemble a piece of polished black pebble. And because of the moderate body size plus the curved back, the Magic feels nice in my hand.. To my surprise, the Magic is powered by an aging Kirin 950 -- the same octa-core SoC inside last year's Mate 8 -- which is quite disappointing for a "concept phone." That said, it still comes with 4GB of RAM plus 64GB of internal storage, the same set of cameras as the Honor 8 (a 12-megapixel f/2.2 dual-lens camera plus an 8-megapixel f/2.4 selfie camera), global LTE bands and dual SIM connectivity (but secondary SIM is limited to 2G). Gone are the usual Android navigation keys below the screen; they are all rolled into the multi-function fingerprint reader on the front: Press for home, double tap to show recent apps and swipe left to go back. I'm not a fan of this implementation, but it does free up some space on the bezel for easier holding.. The 2,900 mAh battery here may not sound so appealing when many of the latest flagship phones are offering an extra 300 to 800 mAh more juice, but the focus here is actually on the battery's new graphite structure courtesy of Huawei's 2012 Lab. According to internal tests, a 10-minute charge can already get a depleted battery back to 40 percent, whereas a 20-minute charge gets you up to 70 percent. Based on our quick percentage conversion, this appears to be breaking the record previously set by the Moto Z Force and its 30W charger. And for those who are wondering, Honor pointed out that there are protection mechanisms in the phone, the charger and even the bundled cable to keep you safe.. One less noticeable addition on the Magic is the infrared camera on the front, which makes use of Tobii's eye-tracking algorithm. When you pick up the phone, the screen will automatically turn on only when you're looking at it. This means you won't have to find the power button while picking up the phone. On top of that there's the FaceCode feature: The notification content on the lock screen is hidden by default, but it's automatically displayed when the phone recognizes your registered face.. Things get even more interesting on the software side. Honor's Magic Live UI is based on Android 6.0 and packs many situation-aware features. My favorite one is the lock screen shortcut key that's automatically generated based on one's daily habit. For instance, over time the phone will learn that when you go to work at 8AM you tend to listen to music, so it'll show the music app's icon in the bottom left corner of the lock screen around that time; at noon you tend to use a restaurant guide app to find a spot for lunch, so the shortcut will be there for you then; and so on. Another useful scenario is when you whip out the phone in the dark, that same spot will give you the flashlight button just in case.. The Magic's lock screen also automatically brings up relevant information based on your location, messages and purchase history. Say when you're off to pick up a parcel from the courier, the phone will load up your parcel's tracking number as you approach one of the designated collection points. Likewise with electronic boarding passes when you're at the airport, and the same goes for movie tickets when you're at the cinema. Soon after booking a cab through an app -- Didi Chuxing , in this case -- the lock screen will also retain the driver's details until your ride starts. All of this is a bit like Google Now but without having to unlock your phone (and besides, Google Now doesn't work in China unless you use VPN).. The list of intelligent features on the Magic doesn't stop there, so we'll keep it brief: There's driving detection to remind the user to switch to the driving interface (Motorola did this first with the Moto X back in 2013); when on WeChat, the default keyboard recommends an answer whenever you get a generic question -- be it about the weather or an address; and long press the home button to toggle DeepThink on-screen keyword search (which is Huawei's own take on Google Now's screen search feature).. Alas, unlike previous Honor devices, the Magic doesn't come cheap: It's priced at 3,699 yuan which is about $530 -- just a tad more expensive than Xiaomi's very own "concept phone," the Mi MIX. Not that it matters for most of us, anyway, as we understand that much like the Mi MIX, the Magic won't be available outside China. But if all goes well, some of the aforementioned features may eventually end up on future Huawei-branded devices, so just sit back and let others be Huawei's guinea pigs for the time being.. china , gear , hands-on , honor , huawei , kirin950 , magic , mobile , phone , smartphone , tobii. Richard's love for gadgets was probably triggered by an electric shock at the age of five while poking his finger into power sockets for no reason. He managed to destroy a few more desktops and phones until he was sent to England for school.

SteelSeries Teams With Tobii To Track Your Eyes And Make You A Better. Huawei launches its new MediaPad M5. Gartner reports first ever global decline in smartphone. intelligence agencies are still warning against buying Huawei and ZTE. Posted Dec 16, 2016 by Devin Coldewey. Vine won’t be removed from the app stores, will instead relaunch as “Vine. Lucky China, always getting the good stuff. First pandas, and now the Huawei Honor Magic. This curvy beauty is packed with interesting tech, from a dual-camera system on the back to an eye-tracking sensor from Tobii on the front — and a whole lot of custom software in between.. The display underneath that lovely smooth glass is a 5-inch AMOLED one with a 2560×1440 resolution, giving it an exceedingly high 577 PPI. Dual 12-megapixel cameras on the back, one color and one monochrome, should produce excellent imagery.. The frame is itself a sensor, the home button is also a fingerprint reader, and on the front is an eye-tracking unit from Tobii, which generally builds them into laptops and monitors — this is the first smartphone they’ve put one in.. “The consumer electronics industry is placing emphasis on eye tracking as a new, exciting interaction modality,” said Tobii Tech president Oscar Werner in a press release. “We see this happening simultaneously in gaming, VR and smartphones.”. It’s used for a multi-factor authentication technique Huawei calls WiseScreen. When you pick up the phone, the frame senses how you’re holding it, and Tobii sensor checks your eyes. If you pass, it unlocks right away. Face recognition is also built in, and you can register your face and a few other ones that can check notifications. The usual caveats for biometric authentication apply, of course.. As if that wasn’t “Magic” enough, Huawei’s custom Android build adds context-sensitive information to Wechat, maps, and the browser, giving you the usual AI assistant stuff: movie times, directions, tracking numbers, that sort of thing. One I might actually use: hold down the home button in the browser and it’ll pull up lots more info on whatever page you’re visiting, presumably more news stories, Wikipedia entries and so on.. Alas, as with many of Huawei’s devices, this one is China-only, with little chance of appearing on this side of the Pacific. But if it’s a hit, you can probably expect some of these features, or let’s hope this fabulous design at least, to appear in an international device. We’ll be sure to check this thing out when we’re at CES in a couple weeks; in the meantime, more info is available at JD if you can read it..

Huawei Honor Magic unveiled: curvy body, dual cameras. Huawei unveiled the curviest phone ever - the Honor Magic. Every edge and every corner of the device is as smooth as a pebble, but whats inside is cutting edge.. The screen measures 5.09 - a tack sharp AMOLED with QHD resolution (577ppi) - and it sits below the curved glass. The flowing body of the phone measures 7.8mm thick and weighs 145g. It is available in Golden Black and Porcelain White.. On the back is a dual 12MP camera (color + monochrome) with an f/2.2 aperture and large 1.4µm pixels, plus an 8MP selfie camera (f/2.0). The Huawei Honor Magic runs Android 6.0 with Honor Magic Live OS. It has ample memory - 4GB of RAM and 64G storage.. Part of the magic is DeepThink, a digital assistant that collaborates with FaceCode. That uses an infrared camera to recognize users eyes so only you and people you trust can view your notifications. The Home key is a fingerprint reader too.. The one iffy part is the Kirin 950 chipset. An octa-core processor (four of the cores are A72) offers enough speed, but the GPU is rather weak and the chipset cant handle 4K 2160p video capture, which limits the cameras capabilities.. The phone is powered by a 2,900mAh battery that gets 90% charge in half an hour with the Huawei Magic Power charger. Its 20 minutes to 70% and 10 minutes to 40%, all while keeping the phone cool. The dual SIM card slot design is unique as it stacks the two cards.. The Huawei Honor Magic is priced as a premium device - CNY 3,700 (~$530/500) - and is already available for pre-order in China (expected delivery: December 25).. Huawei's Honor Magic concept phone allegedly stars in leaked image. Here is the beautiful Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design unboxed. Huawei Honor 8 receives a $100 price cut in the US.

Wow, the magic phone has landed. I am very thankful that you included camera and being it a dual camera too. Thank you for making it amoled and QHD as well.

Huawei has been releasing teasers for its upcoming “concept” phone, the Honor Magic, for a little while now, but today, the teasing is over. The new phone is now official and it does indeed have a number of interesting features that make it stand out from the crowd.. First the bad news: this phone is only slated to be sold in Huawei’s home country of China. It will be available from several retailers, including Vmall.com, JD, Tmall and Suning, starting today. Pricing is also unknown as of this writing, but we will update this post when we learn more. It’s possible that Honor will bring the Magic to other markets, but. At first glance, many of the specs here are pretty standard fare, with the Honor Magic sharing the same Kirin 950 as found in the Honor 8. However, things really get interesting when you look at some of the unique extras onboard.. With the core specs out of the way, we can get to the good stuff. The Honor Magic is supposed to have several interesting additions, many of which are supposed to showcase AI driven features. One of these standout features is the WiseScreen sensor, which combines a sensor in its frame and an infrared sensor in the front-facing camera. When the owner of the Honor Magic picks up the phone, the frame sensor and the camera are supposed to recognize the owner’s hand and eyes, which then turns on the screen. When the phone is put down by the owner, or put away in a pocket, the screen is supposed to turn off in one second.. Another new feature is called FaceCode Intelligent Recognition. notifications on the phone will only reveal themselves for pre-registered faces. That means you shouldn’t have to worry about anyone picking up the phone and seeing messages that they are not suppose to see.. AI-driven features will be offered as part of the phone, via Honor Magic Live. The company released some examples of how this AI technology will work with the phone:. The Honor Magic is also supposed to activate certain features as needed. For example, when you enter a dark room at night, the phone’s auto lock screen will launch the flashlight feature to brighten things up. Finally, the phone is supposed to have what’s being called a My Pocket feature, which will allow owners to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to activate the save and share button. This will allow them to access articles, videos and music and share them with others.. While the phone’s special AI features and sensors are obviously the showcase features here, it’s also worth talking about the phone’s design. Honor Magic has a 5.06-inch 2K AMOLED. The double 3D glass covers are supposed to reflect bright, shining lights. The phone’s home button has been designed to also replace the standard “back” and “overview” smartphone buttons. Users will be able to touch, double tap or swipe on the same home key for all those functions. This is supposed to make the phone’s overall screen bigger than normal. The home button also has a fingerprint sensor.. The phone’s battery is supposed to be made of a “special graphite molecular structure”. Combined with a new charging circuit design, the Honor Magic is only supposed to take 10 minutes to get up to 40 percent of its battery charge, and 20 minutes to charge up to 70 percent of its battery charge. One of its lenses is supposed to take black and white image while the other lens takes color photos. This is supposed to offer more detail and more colorful photos compared to the normal smartphone camera set up.. Huawei clearly wants the Honor brand to be a leader in offering innovative smartphone design and features. On paper, the Honor Magic seems to fulfill that goal, but it’s too bad that it will only be available in China. We look forward to seeing some or all of these features making their way to more widely available phones from the company in the future.. What is your opinion on the Honor Magic?

Huawei has definitely provided us with an answer and it’s nothing short of magical; behold the Huawei Honor Magic: the curviest smartphone ever to grace the market is upon us. Time to Honor those Magical curves.. As mentioned before, the Honor Magic is a device designed in a tad different way to most other smartphones. Its curves meander all around the smartphone while its edges smoothly nestle into its beautifully crafted edges. The device not only features curves on its back but its display also takes some benefit of them.. Speaking about its dimensions, the Honor Magic has definitely lived up to the definition of a babe with a slim 7.8mm width while weighing in at 145g is not bad either.. Moving onto its curvy front; it features a 5.09 inches AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with a mouth-watering 577ppi pixel density. This translates into a spectacular 1440p HD resolution that has its roots firmly stuck in QHD quality. In short, no problems will ever arise on this superbly sharp display.. Mirroring the Honor 8 , the smartphone features a dual-camera setup that looks exactly like the aforementioned device. The 12 megapixel dual-sensor sits without any sort of platform like in the iPhone 7 Plus with unbelievable shooting quality and features which include phase detection autofocus. The selfie camera deserves all the clapping you can give it as it features a more than enough powerful 8 megapixel sensor; say cheese!. The Honor Magic is powered by a crude combination of on Octa-Core processor with an additional 4GB of RAM. Lying close to the F1 category, this much power can easily run the built-in Android Marshmallow without any problems at all while its internal storage banks at 64 gigs.. One of the smartphone’s most exciting features is the Deep Think technology; a digital assistant that works in tandem with an infrared camera sensor capable of detecting your eyes so that your notifications are only visible to you. Fast charge and USB-type C bring this Magical smartphone to a close.. More Mobiles like Huawei Honor Magic. Signup for our newsletter and get discount vouchers. 
With the wave of a magic wand, Huawei unveils the AI-powered Honor Magic. Honor, a sub-brand of the Chinese. manufacturer Huawei, waved something of a magic wand this morning.. At a press event on Thursday, it announced the Honor Magic, a smartphone equipped with artificially intelligent assistant that aims to anticipate your needs before you do.. “The Honor Magic […] marks the culmination of Honor’s extended R&D efforts in bringing the best of technology to its customers,” Huawei said in a statement. “The Honor Magic breaks new ground by incorporat[ing] artificial intelligence designed to understand and analyze users’ data in order to provide intelligent interactive features.”. At first glance, you wouldn’t guess it — there’s nothing particularly “magic” about the Magic’s on the outside. That’s not a knock against its aluminum unibody, an appealing sloping, curving candy bar. design with ever-so-slightly tapered edges, but a testament to the Magic’s minimalism. On the front is a 5-inch Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440 pixels) AMOLED screen shielded by curved glass, above which sits an earpiece, a proximity sensor, an 8-megapixel camera with a fixed-focus lens and f/2.0 aperture, and little else.. One item of special note is Magic’s home button, which doubles as a fingerprint scanner and one-stop navigational shop. Using a combination of touch, taps, and swipes, you unlock the Magic, return to previous pages within apps, and launch the home screen.. On the Magic’s rear is a 12-megapixel dual-lens sensor with. It, much like the dual-camera sensor on the Honor 8, captures a black-and-white and color image simultaneously to produce “clearer” and more “vibrant” images than single-sensor modules are capable. On the Magic’s accented aluminum sides are a power button, volume rocker, loudspeaker, and requisite 3.5mm audio and microUSB ports.. The Magic’s interior, much like its exterior, is relatively simple. Powering the handset is Huawei’s proprietary Kirin 950, an octa-core processor with four low-power cores for lighter tasks, and four high-power cores that kick in to crunch bigger numbers. A 64GB memory module handles the Magic’s storage needs, while 4GB of RAM juggles apps and a combination Wi-Fi/Bluetooth 4.2/GPS radio manages wireless connectivity. Myriad sensors, including a hall effect sensor, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, compass, accelerometer, phone-status indicator, and gyroscope, round things out.. Powering the Magic’s components is a 2,900mAh battery that supports Huawei Magic Power, a proprietary rapid charging technology enabled by “new battery materials.” Thanks to the Magic’s “graphite molecular structure” and charging circuit design, Huawei said that it can. juice up to 70 percent capacity in 20 minutes, or up to 40 percent capacity in 10 minutes.. The Magic’s true secret sauce lies in its software: Honor Magic Live, a proprietary operating system that drives. The undisputed highlight is Smart Services, a Google Now-like recommendation engine that serves up contextual suggestions. When you’re chatting about movies with via an app like Hangouts, the Magic recommends the latest blockbusters. When you’re on the road, it automatically launches a driving mode. When you press and hold the Magic’s home button while you’re browsing the web, it’ll surface information about the current page. And Magic’s Smart Display shows information like an incoming Uber’s license plate number, movie ticket booking codes, and package statuses on the lockscreen.. WideScreen leverages a sensor on the Magic’s frame to recognize your hands and eyes: When you pick up the phone from resting position, the screen switches on, and when you put it down or place it in your pocket,. FaceCode reveals text message notifications only when it recognizes your likeness. Magical Transformation serves up a flashlight button on the Magic’s lock screen in dark environments. And My Pocket offers a bookmarking tool for music, articles, and videos that can be quickly summoned with a swipe up from the bottom of the screen.. The Honor Magic launches on the eve of the Honor brand’s third anniversary. The subbrand, which now reaches more than 74 different countries and regions, topped $6 billion in global sales this year. “The Honor Magic encapsulates our commitment to cutting-edge innovation and technology,” George Zhao, president of Honor, said in a statement. “Through this launch, we at Honor are telling our fans around the globe that we are genuinely committed to challenging ourselves and willing to disrupt the status quo to ultimately be able to bring the best mobile internet experience to them.”. Huawei, the sprawling electronics maker, has other reasons to pop out the champagne this year. Sales jumped a healthy 40 percent in the first half of this year, defying a downward industry trend. With 61 million smartphones sold in the first few months of 2016 alone, the company’s well on its way to achieving its stated 140 million goal by 2017.. Magic Leap One: Everything you need to know.

Now, that's Magic: Honor's new phone has stunningly fast facial recognition. Honor’s Magic lives up to its name thanks to clever and beneficial use of AI, and a stunning design.. There’s something mystical happening inside the Honor Magic. Beneath the utterly stunning body is a clever artificial intelligence program that, along with a host of sensors and cameras, turns the already desirable device into a truly smart phone. We got a jaw-dropping demonstration of its abilities at CES 2017 , and the great news is that although the Magic is only for sale in China, the tech is expected to arrive in an Honor phone we’ll actually be able to buy in the future.. Here’s an example of what makes the Magic, well, magic. The front facing camera uses facial recognition technology to ensure your lock screen notifications are safe from prying eyes, with the least interference to you. After setting the Magic up to recognize my face, a text message arrived and when looked at by anyone but me, the lock screen notification simply read “text message.” The moment I looked at the screen, the Magic instantly knew it was me, and revealed the number and the contents of the message.. The action is so fast, so seamless, that the Magic really lives up to its name. In our short test, the facial recognition was 100 percent accurate each time, refusing to reveal the message to my colleague, and happily giving up the information to me, even when changing faces immediately. It’s genuinely impressive to see, and a feature that most will consider beneficial.. The Magic uses AI in a similar way to how Facebook and others are using chat bots in messenger platforms. The phone observes your actions, and will make recommendations at opportune moments. For example, if you’re texting about making plans to see a movie, the Magic will chime in with suggestions on movies available nearby, and options to book tickets. This works throughout, with the Magic offering to help with transportation, simplify messaging and emails, deal with contacts, and much more. If there are any sections where you’d rather the phone didn’t intrude, there are settings to disable its omnipresent gaze.. Much of the personalized information is collated onto a separate home screen, accessed with a swipe to the right, giving you quick access to key details when you need them. Here, you’ll also find recommendations for music and entertainment, based on your existing choices and preferences. The style is reminiscent of LG’s Smart Bulletin installed on the G4 .. The Honor Magic runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and instead of Huawei’s EMUI (Emotion UI) over the top, it has Magic Live UI. This is way more customized than we’re used to seeing, moving away from stock Android and even EMUI 5.0 installed on the Mate 9 , for a very different experience. Swipe up from the bottom of the screen and you get an iOS-like shortcut screen, plus a few interface adjustments. Swipe down from the top and you’ll find fitness tracking stats. Apps are spread across multiple home screens, also like iOS. While EMUI is moving away from such drastic changes, and toward standard Android, Magic Live UI has gone in the opposite direction.. Also headed in a new direction is design. The Honor Magic looks unlike any other phone on sale, and that’s a pretty unusual statement to make today, when so many devices imitate the iPhone or Samsung’s Galaxy devices. The front and back are covered in curved glass, giving the phone a lozenge-like shape that’s both pleasing (if a little slippery) to hold, and absolutely stunning to look at. The screen isn’t curved, but is a manageable 5.1-inches in size, with a large 2,560 x 1,440 pixel resolution. It looks equally as stunning as the phone itself.. On the back is a centrally mounted dual-camera lens, built into the body itself, without any bump or modification to the sleek glass shell. Both have 12 megapixels and can shoot bokeh-style pictures (photos with background blurring). We tried it out and the effect not only looks great — as you’d expect, both Honor and Huawei have considerable experience here — but is very fast, with the software just creating the best image without any delay. The front camera is 8 megapixel.. This compact size makes the Magic very light at 145 grams, and incredibly pocket friendly. Honor has consistently made attractive phones, but this is a real step beyond. Take this out anywhere, and it’s going to grab plenty of attention. Huawei’s Kirin 950 processor also seen in the P9 powers the Honor Magic, with 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of internal storage space. The battery has a 2,900mAh battery with fast charging, which may be a little small to power the phone for more than a day.. In China, where the Magic is already on sale, it costs around $400. This marks it as a real bargain, putting it alongside the Axon 7 and OnePlus 3T. Although the Magic itself may not arrive in the United States, the artificial intelligence technology onboard will make it to the States in a future Honor phone. We’re excited about that, and hope the Magic itself is a hint of the direction Honor will take with future designs.. Sharp shooters: The best camera phones you can buy.

Huawei EMUI , used on Honor and Huawei branded phones. Top : The logo used for Honor brand. Bottom : The 2017 flagship Honor 9. Honor (stylized as honor ), is a sub-brand belonging to networking and telecommunications equipment and services company Huawei. Headquartered in Shenzhen, China , the Honor series of mobile computing devices include smartphones , tablet computers , and wearable technology .. Honor, a sub-brand under the Huawei Group, was conceived in late 2011 and established in 2013. [1] [2] Since its inception, the Honor line of smartphones has helped Huawei compete in budget online brands in China. The company began its international expansion in 2014. [5] In April 2014, it launched the Honor 3C in Malaysia, [6] and it entered the European market in October 2014, with an announcement in Berlin. Its first flagship phone for Europe was the Honor 6. [7] 20 million Honor phones were sold within the first six months of 2015, equal to the number sold in all of 2014. [4] [8] By June 2015, the brand had expanded into 74 countries, including European nations, India, and Japan. Honor's second flagship phone, Honor 7 , was released in 2015. [9] In October 2015, Honor announced its goal to double sales and profits, reaching $5 billion in profit, and announced plans to focus on India. Honor's Vmall online store, which was previously available in China, [10] launched in Europe and the United Kingdom in 2015, [11] enabling direct purchases from the manufacturer. [12] In late 2015, Honor confirmed plans to expand the smartphone series and wearable technology into the United States. The brand debuted in the United States in January 2016 at the Consumer Electronics Show with the Huawei Honor 5X. [14] [9] [15] The phone was initially available for online purchase only, but later available at select brick-and-mortar stores. [14] In August 2016, Recode reported that Honor has sold 60 million Honor products, generating over $8.4 billion in revenue. [16] Honor's third flagship phone, Honor 8 , was also released in 2016. In December 2016, Honor unveiled the Honor Magic, which was launched on the eve of the brand's third anniversary and includes artificial intelligence software designed to provide "intelligent interactive features" based on user data. [18] [19] In January 2017, at the Consumer Electronics Show, Honor announced that the Honor 6X, which was previously available in China, would expand into 13 additional markets, including the United States. [20] [21] The phone earned "best of CES 2017" awards from several technology publications, including Android Authority, [22] [23] Digital Trends , [24] Slash Gear, [25] and Talk Android. [26] The flagship Honor 8 Pro , known as Honor V9 in China, [27] launched in April 2017. [28] Honor's fourth flagship phone, the Honor 9 , was released in June 2017, [29] and one million units were shipped within the first month. George Zhao serves as global president of the Honor brand, [14] and Eva Wimmers is the president of the brand in Europe. As of 2016, Honor sells products primarily online via its own sites as well as via online third-party retailers. Some Honor products are available to purchase at stores in select markets. Honor is able to offer smartphones at lower prices because the company saves money by operating online. [9] [33] Initially, the company only sold its smartphones online, directly from the company. [4] [33] The brand offers flash sales in some markets, but not others. [33] [34] Honor has offered discounts for joining the "Honor Club". ^ a b c d Lai, Richard (16 December 2013).
