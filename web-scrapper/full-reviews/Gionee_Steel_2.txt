Gionee recently released a new smartphone in China- the Gionee Steel 2. It comes with a quad-core CPU, 3GB RAM, and 4000mAh battery.. Last month, Gionee launched a smartphone called Gionee M2017. Apparently, there is still another one in the company's sleeves. A new smartphone from Gionee- the Steel 2- was recently announced and here's what it has to offer.. The Gionee Steel 2 sports a 5-inch HD IPS display with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels. It is powered by a quad-core MT6737 processor clocked at 1.25GHz accompanied by 3GB of RAM and two internal memory storage options- 16GB and 32GB- which is expandable up to 128GB via a microSD card.. In the photography department, the Steel 2 has an 8-megapixel rear snapper with remarkable features such as LED flash, HDR, panoramic, night, Xpress and intelligent scan where it's able to perform helpful tasks such as business card scanning, scanning translation and text correction. Its front-facing shooter features a 5-megapixel camera sensor. Running the device is Android's 6.0 Marshmallow with Amigo 3.5 on top while being fueled by a huge 4000mAh polymer lithium-ion battery.. The Gionee Steel 2 has a body dimension of 144.3 x 70.5 x 8.6mm and weighs 140 grams. It has several connectivity options like 4G LTE with VoLTE, WiFi 802.11 ac, Bluetooth 4.0, and GPS. It also comes with the traditional 3.5mm audio jack, a fingerprint scanner that doubles as its home button. Lastly, the handset comes in two color variants- Jazz Gold and Gold Black.. Considering its processor and other specs, we can see that the phone is in the mid-range category. However, it has a quite larger battery backup than others in the same line. But the best part here is that it comes at a very affordable price of USD190 for its 16GB variant and is now available for pre-order in China.

Think the Gionee M7 is expensive? Then you may want to check out the Gionee Steel 2 Plus, the second 18:9 FullView display smartphone announced today by the Chinese manufacturer.. The Gionee Steel 2 Plus is a successor to the Steel 2. The Plus variant is a big upgrade in all aspects.

The Steel 2 Plus packs a 6-inch 18:9 FullView display too but with a HD+ resolution. It has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of built-in storage compared to the 3GB RAM and 16GB/32GB of the Steel 2. It also swaps the MediaTek MT6737 SoC for a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor.. Its rear camera is a single 13MP sensor with a circular LED flash on the right. Front camera has also been upgraded to an 8MP sensor. Another key upgrade is the addition of a fingerprint scanner, although it sits at the back of the device.. The Gionee Steel 2 packs a 4,000mAh battery which is more than sufficient for a 5-inch HD phone. The Steel 2 Plus pushes it to 5,000mAh to complement the bigger 6.0-inch HD+ screen.. Just A Month After The X1, Gionee X1s Arrives With Bigger Display, Larger RAM & 16MP Selfie Camera. The Gionee Steel 2 Plus is priced at ¥1999 (~$302) and comes in black, blue and gold.
