A 4G-enabled £59 smartphone that also offers expandable storage; what’s not to like?. Alcatel Pixi 4 (5) review: Price and competition Alcatel Pixi 4 (5) review: Build quality Alcatel Pixi 4 (5) review: Display Alcatel Pixi 4 (5) review: Software Alcatel Pixi 4 (5) review: Performance Alcatel Pixi 4 (5) review: Camera Alcatel Pixi 4 (5) review: Verdict. Its been over a year since I reviewed the Alcatel Pixi 4 (5), and since its competitors have dropped in price, while the Pixi is now becoming increasingly hard to source. SO, how does it stack up against its rivals, and is the £59 smartphone worth considering? Here's my original review below, with updated pricing details.. The Alcatel Pixi 4 5045X is a 5in quad-core smartphone that comes with 4G connectivity, Android 6 Marshmallow and a microSD card expansion slot. That much isn’t unusual; it’s the price that sets the eyebrows rising, because this is usable smartphone that can be bought for a mere £59. That’s £100 cheaper than our favourite “budget” smartphone, the Moto G4.. The Pixi 4 comes in different sizes and specifications, but Alcatel hasn’t made it easy to distinguish between the different models. There’s the Alcatel Pixi 4 (4), the Pixi (5) and the Pixi (6), all of which have different screen sizes and internals. To make it even more confusing there are also 4G and 3G models of the Pixi 4 (5). Here, I’m reviewing the Alcatel Pixi 4 (5) 5045X 4G-enabled model.. READ NEXT: Best budget phones to buy in 2018 .. You can find the Pixi 4 (5) 4G for around £55 at Argos , from EE for around £60 and for around. Its main competitor is the excellent Vodafone Smart Prime 7 , a now £50 smartphone, though, it is locked to Vodafone's network.. READ NEXT: Vodafone Smart Prime 7 review - a real bargain. The Pixi (5) has a 5in display, which to me, is about the right size for media browsing, videos and one-handed operation. However it is a tad heavy, weighing 148g, and a touch thick at 9.5mm from front to back, so it isn’t the most comfortable thing to hold.. The front bezels are acceptably thin, with three touch capacitive buttons found below the screen. You’ll find a microUSB charging and data port at the bottom, volume rocker and power button on the right, plus a 3.5mm headphone jack at the top of the phone.. The rear cover of the phone is made entirely out of plastic, and can be popped off where you’ll find a removable 2,000mAh lithium-ion battery, micro-SIM and microSD storage slots.. I should also mention that the phone’s sound quality is acceptable, with its single front-facing speaker delivering acceptable levels of volume.. With a 5in display, I’d expect the phone to have a 720p (720 x 1,280) screen, but unfortunately with the Pixi 4 you’re left with a rather disappointing 480 x 854 resolution, resulting in a low pixel density of 196ppi.. In comparison, the Vodafone Smart Prime 7 has a 5in 720p screen with a pixel density of 293ppi. This means you won’t be watching those YouTube videos in HD, and you’ll be able to see pixelated text when reading the news (or this review).. With a 356cd/m2 brightness, the Pixi 4 (5) is bright enough to be used outdoors, but it isn’t bright enough to read in blazing sunlight. If you’re looking to watch movies on the device, you’ll find its screen size acceptable, but the low resolution and 70.6% sRGB coverage, mean images look grainy and and a touch dull.. At maximum brightness, it has an underwhelming 0.40cd/m2 black level, too, and the 868:1 contrast ratio isn’t wonderful. Given the price, I’d expect something a little below par, but it’s quite a bit worse than the Vodafone Smart Prime 7. Also worth noting is that colours do shift when you view the screen from different angles.. The good news is that the phone comes with Android 6 Marshmallow on board. While this isn’t the very latest version of Google’s mobile OS, it’s still pretty good. Android 6 is easy to use and has a slick interface that’s responsive even on the Pixi 4’s lowly hardware.. Better still, you’re not hit with a lot of bloatware from Alcatel or an over-weaning Android skin. However, it does come pre-installed with Alcatel’s OneTouch Launcher, but this can easily be changed. Other than a handful of forced-system apps, the Pixi 4 (5) provides a pure Android experience, which is always refreshing to see. As with any stock Android device, however, you the entire suite of Google apps, including Maps, Gmail, YouTube and Google Drive (among others) is pre-installed.. The Pixi 4 is a budget phones, and it didn’t surprise me to see it perform like one. Housing a quad-core, 1GHz MTK6735M Mediatek processor and a mere 1GB of RAM, it only managed a score of 416 in our Geekbench 4 single-core tests and 1,173 in the multi-core tests.. Putting this into perspective, the Samsung Galaxy J5 managed 555 and 1948 respectively, while the mid-range OnePlus 3T manages an impressive 1,903 and 4,274 in these tests. This means if you plan on opening many apps and running Chrome with multiple tabs, you’ll find yourself frustrated.. Gaming results were rather poor, too, with GFXBench recording a score of 5.4fps at native resolution. Again, however, that’s nothing out of the ordinary at this price; in comparison, the Vodafone Smart Prime 7 achieved 4fps in this test, primarily due to the higher resolution screen placing more strain on its weak graphics chip.. Finally, to battery life, which is the Pixi 4’s weakest suite. Unlike the Vodafone Smart Prime 7, which was reasonably impressive, the Pixi 4 (5) managed only 8h 17m. If you’re a heavy smartphone owner, you may want to look elsewhere.. I was also less than impressed with rear-facing 5-megapixel and front-facing 2-megapixel cameras. With or without flash the Pixi 4 struggled taking acceptable photos, with noise spoiling every shot.. When testing its colour accuracy, I found the Pixi 4 (5) had slightly washed out colours, while it was also unable to cope with background shadows, unless your object is well lit. To add more concerns about its camera, I was unable to touch-to-focus, meaning it had a continuous auto focus that can be a problematic when trying to record fast moving objects.. Best budget smartphone 2018: The TOP cheap phones to buy in 2018. Vodafone Smart Prime 7 review: The best budget phone under £50. Enabling HDR mode improved things a little, but no matter what the conditions, the Pixi 4’s photos looked grainy and murky, and to make matters worse, you can’t touch-to-focus, meaning you have to rely on the camera software to pick the right spot to focus on. This, I found, was hit and miss.. ^Same image taken with HDR - brickwork can be seen, colours are more vibrant and there’s less image noise. ^Colours aren’t vibrant, shadows aren’t properly depicted and there’s a lot of image noise in low-light shots.. Most critically, perhaps, the Pixi 4’s camera is significantly worse than the Vodafone Smart Prime 7’s. If you’re looking to take a lot of pictures and even selfies, I’d suggest investing a little bit more for the Prime 7’s superior camera.. Despite its shortcomings, the Pixi 4 (5) isn’t awful and for £59 it’s ludicrously cheap for a 5in 4G-enabled smartphone. Performance is respectable for basic tasks, and screen is fine, too.. If you’re looking to watch a lot of content on your smartphone and enjoy taking photographs, however, I’d suggest investing in the Vodafone Smart Prime 7, instead. That phone offers all these features, has nicer build quality and significantly better battery life and a nicer camera. It used to cost £10-15 more, but since has dropped to around the same price as the Alcatel , making it a significantly better buy..

Mi Alcatel Pixi 4 (5) No lee la SD la expulsa y se reinicia solo, antes si lo hacía y cuando la expulsaba la volvia a insertar y la leia ahora solo la expulsa y se reinicia. ¿Lo boto? Apenas tengo 10 meses con el y es muy muy muy lento.. Como técnico en telefonía celular NO SE LOS RECOMIENDO. Para funciones básicas es bueno, pero a la hora de meterle mano (ya sea liberarlo con box, rootearlo, etc...) es un tremendo asco; ¿Porque? El movil se "brickea" fácilmente (ni con la stock rom en ocasiones lo sacas de ahi), inclusive la lógica del mismo llega a bloquearse definitivamente. Es de los móviles mediatek que son mas tediosos de componer.. Buen dia tengo dos equipos alcatel pixi 4.5 ambos en unefon de 1 año de vida todo estaba bien de repente la semana pasada comenzaron a ponerse lentos y de repente se apagaron y al prenderlos solo se queda en el logo de alcatel one touch y no puedo hacer nada para poder accesar a ninguna de las aplicaciones. La bateria se descarga en 18horas estando el telefono en reposo total.Tiene 3meses de vida el aparato.. yo tengo el alcatel pixi 4 (5) me funciona perfecto lo tengo hace un mes y esta intacto. Hola mi pixi 4 de estar bien de repente se apaga o no se que pasa presiono el botón de bloqueo y no prende ni nada tengo que conectar el cargador para que encienda tengo 15 días con el, alguno de ustedes les a pasado eso, o saben el porque.. pero al momento de meterle una memoria SD para que sea memoria principal me la daña, ya le he puesto 2 y en ambos casos ocurrio lo mismo. Hola ¡¡¡ yo acabo de comprar un pixi. todo bien pero no puedo poner la cámara me dice que permitir que cámara pueda realizar y gestionar ? y después aparece superposición de pantalla detectada, que tengo que cambiar la configuración de este permiso. y me voy a ajustes pero no puedo, le intento de varias formas pero no me deja ver la camara ¡¡¡. Relativamente hablando de la relación autonomía vs precio creo que todas las características están de acuerdo nada mas cabe resaltar que :. La carga tiende a acabarse rápidamente estamos hablando de que cargo mi celular toda la noche y desde las 6 am me dura hasta 12:30 del medio día. Y si usas tu celular para ver vídeos o jugar o estas fuera usando datos es prácticamente imposible que sobreviva con la carga completa. Pues a mi me parece que la batería no le dura la carga ni siquiera un poco se tiene que descargar muy rápido cuando lo cargo a 100% dentro de unos segundos ya está en 90% y así de poco en poco..

The new handsets run the range from a tiny, entry-level 3.5-inch phone to a 6-inch Android 6.0 whopper.. by January 5, 2016 5:00 AM PST. Alcatel's six new Pixi 4 phones (pictures). Alcatel Pixi 4 phones go from really big to really little. Pixi 4 phone sizes : Pixi 4 (3.5) Pixi 4 (4) Pixi 4 (4.5) Pixi 4 (5) Pixi 4 (5.5) Pixi 4 (6). Alcatel's Pixi family of six Android phones gives us one of the smallest-screen new phones we've seen and one of the largest.. Although this Pixi line has never been anything other than entry-level to midrange, this year's lineup dots the spectrum from a tiny 3.5-inch screen all the way up to a gargantuan 6-incher.. The phones will sell in various markets in the coming months -- don't expect to see them all in the same country. Likewise, prices will vary by phone and currency, but if there's one thing Alcatel's Pixi line is known for, it's lower-than-average pricing.. Alcatel's six new Pixi 4 phones (pictures). The Lilliputian 3.5-inch Pixi 4 model houses the most basic specs of the Pixi six-pack, including an older version of Android (5.1), limited dual-core processor and very simple rear and front-facing cameras (specs below).. On the upper end of the range, the 6-inch version is a more modern, midrange device with a faster processor and 8-megapixel rear camera. The 4-inch, 4.5-inch, 5 and 5.5-inch Pixi 4 handsets falling in between. Compared with last year's Pixi 3 series, the Pixi 4 phones are flatter with straighter sides, though the runt of the litter does feel more like the bubbly Pixi 3 than it does the 6-inch Pixi 4.. The smartphones that matter at CES 2016 (pictures). Hardware-wise, Alcatel's Pixi line purposely runs toward the back of the pack where Alcatel can keep prices low for the type of crowd the Pixi brand tries to attract: a younger, cost-conscious set.. We do know that the 5- and 5.5-inch versions will come to the US, but again, we don't know when or for how much.. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

I have had this phone since August 2016, and cannot count the number of times the phone has failed to connect me to mobile internet.. At first I thought it was maybe an issue with the SP, and our area being out in the sticks in a hilly area. However I was away from home yesterday and the day before, and the same issue cropped up..... I have had this phone since August 2016, and cannot count the number of times the phone has failed to connect me to mobile internet.. At first I thought it was maybe an issue with the SP, and our area being out in the sticks in a hilly area. However I was away from home yesterday and the day before, and the same issue cropped up.. I went into the local SPs shop and explained the problem to them. The gentlemen there ran three diagnostic tests on the phone, and found that the problem was in the handset, not with the network. As the problem couldn't be fixed immediately and I needed my phone for work, I purchased another ( much cheaper) handset that has so. far connected me to the internet every time of asking. Another issue I found with the 5010x was that the battery had only about 60 minutes of use before the it had to be recharged. Also, the standby time was about four hours.. Clearly these issues lay with my handset, and it may be the only dud in the whole batch.. alcatel pixi 4 (5) 5045x frp reset remove google account. alcatel pixi 4 (5) 5045x hard reset. how to remove google account on alcatel pixi 4 (5) 5010x 5010d android 6. reinicio sistema alcatel pixi 4 (5).

Imam telefon preko 2 meseca i mogu reci da je odlican za taj novac.Ekran ima zivlje boje u odnosu na seriju Pixi3,odlicno optimizovan sa quad-core+1gb ram-a imam 27 aplikacija plus fabricke,kamere su prosek meni se tel. ne greje doduse ne igram igrice.Izrada telefona je klasicna tj obicna plastika ali tel je samo 100e,baterija mi izgura ceo dan uz slusanje muzike i surfovanje netom.Za mene kao nezahtevnog korisnika tel je dobar u odnosu na rang Samsungovih modela sa quad core-om i 1 gb rama koji su mi bagovali posle instaliranih par aplikacija.. 07.10.2017 :: 00:34 h :: IP > 178.223.178.107 :: 1671656. Telefon sam uzeo pre desetak dana i iskreno mi je veoma Å¾ao zaÅ¡to nisam kupio neki beÅ¾iÄni fiksni telefon jer bi me sigurno bolje sluÅ¾io ovog krÅ¡a. Kamera je nikakva i joÅ¡ i nema auto fokus, telefonu je sasvim malo potrebno da zabaguje a i inaÄe radi jako jako sporo iako je memorija gotovo prazna, kao ima Quad-core procesor sa 1300 MHz a telefon se greje ako gledaÅ¡ video ili ne daj boÅ¾e najprostiju igricu igraÅ¡ duÅ¾e od 6minuta, kada ga napunite 100% mislim da nema Å¡anse da izdrÅ¾i 18h da ga uopÅ¡te ne dirate, ekran loÅ¡, materijal izrade kao plastiÄno bure za kupus. Jedina dobra stvar sa ovim telefonom je to Å¡to vam neÄe biti Å¾ao ukoliko ga izgubite ili ga neko ukrade. 27.09.2017 :: 22:47 h :: IP > 178.221.19.240 :: 1670777. prvi mobilni telefon sam imao pre nekih 20 godina, uvek su to bili neki srednji modeli al od kad su se pojavili smart telefoni koristim samsung ili LG. Pre mesec dana sam uzeo ovaj telefon preko mreÅ¾e i mogu vam reÄi da za sve ove godine koriÅ¡Äenja telefona na veÄe razoÄarenje nisam naleteo. Telefon je ocena 2/10, jednostavno ceo je loÅ¡, prosto je neverovatno da je ovoliko ogromna razlika izmeÄu njega i starijih modela samsunga ili LG-a, oÄekivao da radi bar osrednje dobro. Telefon je dobar kome treba telefon da se javi i poÅ¡alje povremeno neki sms ili viber poruku eventualno da neÅ¡to slika preko dana kada ima dovoljno sunca. Baterija je bedna, ekran blagi uÅ¾as, aplikacije i taj njegov onetouch fazon dovodi do blaÅ¾eg nervnog sloma. Moja iskrena preporuka je da nipoÅ¡to ne uzimate ovaj telefon, ukoliko nemate telefon kupite neki za 10-20 evra polovan i skupljajte pare za neÅ¡to Å¡to valja jer ovo je katastrofa, ne vredi taj 1 dinar koliko je uz paket i to ukoliko ga uzimate preko mts-a plaÄate i dodatnih 118 din jer je 3G Å¡to me je definitivno odluÄilo da posle dve decenije promenim operatera Äim ovaj istekne pa taman mi nudili besplatno i najbolji telefon i najjaÄi paket. 25.02.2017 :: 17:13 h :: IP > 178.221.234.121 :: 1648669. Imam ovaj telefon oko 6 meseci i veoma sam zadovoljan,pre svega kvalitetom izrade odnosno kvalitetne plastike (telefon mi je ispadao nekoliko puta i nije mu falilo baÅ¡ niÅ¡ta). Jedina zamerka mu je nedostatak autofukusa i malo teÅ¾e skidanje poklopca. Prepuruka je da se slikanje i video snimanje obavlja po dnevnom svetlu kada kvalitet njegovih slika i video zapisa dolazi do punog izraÅ¾aja. Primera radi, ja sam sa njim slikao prednjom kamerom od 8 megapixela slike koje se u rangu sa kvalitetnijim fotoaparatima. Posedujem Olympus foto aparat od 16MP i HD video zapisom i u poreÄenju sa slikama i video zapisom alcatel uopÅ¡te ne zaostaje,Äak ima bolji video zapis. Kvalitet video zapisa najbolje se vidi povezivanjem putem HDMI kabla sa full HD televizorom. Snimci uraÄeni ovim telefonom imaju fantastiÄan spektar boja (posebno snimci prirode i sitnih detalja poput morske pene, trave, potoka i sl.) Moja fotografija Vlasinskog jezera u sumrak slikana ovim telefonom sa obale jezera sa pecaroÅ¡em u Äamcu na sredini jezera je jedna od najlepÅ¡ih slika na promo FB stranici sa viÅ¡e od 10000 lajkova. to se tiÄe baterije njen kapacitet je uobiÄajen kao i na drugim android telefonima, meÄutim prednost u odnosu na neke druge modele telefona je da baterija moÅ¾e da se vadi iz telefona pa je kupovinom joÅ¡ jedne baterije stvar reÅ¡ena. Sve u svemu miÅ¡ljenja sam da je ovaj telefon najbolja investicija u ovom rangu telefona i preporuÄujem ga. 20.02.2017 :: 20:50 h :: IP > 24.135.34.18 :: 1648199. ja imam ovaj telefon nesto vise od 3 meseca, ekran mu je jako los, kotnrast iz razlicitih uglova, kad se igraju neke igre je nepodnosljiv, kamera prednja i zadnja su solidne kao i kvalitet slike, brz je i ne baguje nista, ponekad zasecne na 0.5s al sve u svemu telefon za ove pare je ok, ocena 6/10 â¡ ardaat. 15.12.2016 :: 17:14 h :: IP > 109.163.149.169 :: 1641090. Alcatel Pixi 4 (5) 5045D kupio sam prije 7 dana. MeÄu ostalim "kandidatima" za kupovinu su bili UMi Rome X, Wiko Lenny 3, Leagoo Z5 i Leagoo M5. Navedeni modeli ovih "Å¾" marki su otpali kada sam proÄitao miÅ¡ljenja korisnika koji imaju ove mobitele duÅ¾e od mjesec dana.. to se tiÄe memorije od 8 Gb memorije, meni je bilo raspoloÅ¾ivo 4,23 Gb. Na Ekran se daju primjetiti pikseli i boje prikazuje malo blijeÄe i imaju jaÄi kontrast. Kamera je, moglo bi se reÄi, prosjek. Pod slabijim svjetlom kamera daje loÅ¡e rezultate, meÄutim to se moÅ¾e malo popraviti aktiviranjem noÄnog moda u aplikaciji kamere. Aktiviranje HDR-a ne daje neki poseban rezultat. Snima video u HD-u ali ne neÅ¡to posebno kvalitetno. Prednja kamera daje prihvatljive slike, snima video u 480p rezoluciji. I na prednjoj kameri postoji blic Äiji domet nije neÅ¡to posebno velik, npr. Ako se slikate sa 30 cm udaljenosti blic ima nekog efekta, ali ako je kamera udaljena za cijelu duÅ¾inu vaÅ¡e ruke od vaÅ¡eg lica i nema neki efekt.. Preporuka: PoÅ¡to kamere daju slike sa blijedim bojama preporuÄujem aktiviranje moda "PejsaÅ¾" koji Äini boje Å¾ivljim.. Baterija nekom prosjeÄnom upotrebom moÅ¾e izdrÅ¾ati 15 sati. Äudna stvar je to Å¡to kad vam ostane 15% baterije, ostatak se iscrpi za 2-3 minute (o ovome problemu sam proÄitao na joÅ¡ nekoliko foruma).. Igre ne igram, tako da o tome niÅ¡ta ne mogu reÄi. Iako se ovo moje miÅ¡ljenje Äini kao pljuvanje po ovom modelu, to nije tako, samo sam iskren. Meni je mobitel ok i ne kajem se Å¡to umjesto njega nisam kupio neki model od Umi-ja, Leagoo-a ili sliÄnih marki koji pribliÅ¾no isto koÅ¡taju.. Prednja kamera snima video u rezoluciji od samo 480p. Sa preostalih 15% baterije, oÄekujte da vam se mobitel ugasi u roku od samo par minuta ako vam je ukljuÄen wi-fi ili bluetooth.. Ja sam dobio sluÅ¡alice Äiji jack ne moÅ¾e potpuno da uÄe u utor. Uprkos tome, nema smetnju u zvuku ali ipak izgleda smijeÅ¡no kada 1/3 jacka viri iz utora.. Nema Gorilla staklo, ali s obzirom na cijenu to se ne moÅ¾e uzeti kao nedostatak. s obzirom na cijenu ni to se ne moÅ¾e ocijeniti negativno. Ponavljam joÅ¡ jednom ovom mobitelu dajem prednost u odnosu na mobitele nekih "Å¾" marki pribliÅ¾no iste cijene â¡ vrtlog. 20.11.2016 :: 13:20 h :: IP > 37.220.75.150 :: 1638508. PreporuÄujem ga,telefon je brz,solidnih karakteristika,kamera takoÄe solidna,za proseÄnog korisnika je odliÄan izbor. 07.11.2016 :: 10:23 h :: IP > 82.117.214.150 :: 1637229. Imam ovaj telefon vise od mesec dana i mislim da je za ove pare stvarno super telefon. Kamera je OK, radi brzo, ne greje se uopste, dual sim je na Akcatelu resen stvarno odlicno, ... Imam i neki stari Samsung i mogu da kazem da je jedina mana, mozda, ugao vidljivosti ekrana koji je losiji nego na Samsungu jer ipak Samsung ima jedne od najboljih ekrana. To ne smeta nikako pri normalnom radu ali malo nervira kada nekome hocu da pokazem fotke pa zajedno gledamo jer onaj koji gleda sa strane lose vidi. Dual sim je mnogo bolje resen nego na Samsungu tako da preporucujem ovaj telefon. Vazno je reci da postoje mnogo bolji telefoni, bolja kamera, ekran, brzina,... ali to treba i da se mnogo vise plati. Meni ovo stvrano prstojno radi i nemam nameru da bacam pare na dosta skuplje aparate. 07.09.2016 :: 20:51 h :: IP > 109.94.232.247 :: 1630721. Jedina mana je kamera koja je dosta slaba. Snimci su odliÄni ali fotografije su loÅ¡e, naroÄito pri slabijem svetlu. OÄekivao sam viÅ¡e od 8 MP. Nadam se da je to moguÄe srediti podeÅ¡avanjem kamere. Ako neko zna neki trik da kamera radi bolje u makromodu, neka pomogne... 09.08.2016 :: 06:38 h :: IP > 82.145.211.200 :: 1626611. Telefon za ove pare je super. Imam dual sim model 5010D i veoma sam zadovoljan. Ima sve funkcije koje su mi potrebne. 08.07.2016 :: 10:17 h :: IP > 212.200.65.124 :: 1622380. Pa ovako uzeo sam telefon pre nikih 5 dana i moje dosadasnje iskustvo je sledece: softverski je dosta dobro odradjen, ne baguje, dobar odziv taca, zvuk je sasvim ok, dosta dobro je odradjeno upravljanje podacima. E sad mane: kamera nije nesto mora se covek bas pomuciti da bi nacinio dobru fotku, drugo telefon slabo reaguje na promenu i gubitak signala tako da prekine vam se veza posto ste izasli iz dometa ali na displeju i dalje pokazuje da je pun signal to mi se kod ranijih telefona nije desavalo. Sto se tice baterije drzi ona dobro s obzirom na aplikacije koje sam instalirao ali zato velika mana je brzina punjenja baterije, mnogo sporo puni. Sve u svemu za te novce je ok telefon ja am zadovoljan. 05.07.2016 :: 16:35 h :: IP > 212.200.247.166 :: 1622030. Solidan telefon,odlican odziv taca,lezi u ruci odlicno,brz,postojan,ali najveca mana mu je baterija koja je jako slaba i pored svih iskljucenja,sihronizacije,igrice ne igram,traje jedva 10 sati,jako losa baterija...tu je i kamera,koja je blago ocajna.jako loseg kvaliteta,nema tu 8 mpi prednja i zadnja,jako los blic,u malo zamracenom prostoru,jako lose fotografije pravi,i na svetlu isto slab kvalitet...pohvale sto ima sa prednje strane blic,ali jako lose sve u svemu.meni jako siromasan isto..Nova launcher malo spasava stvar....ove dve stavke koje su bukvalno najbitinije,su jako lose,ostalo sve je solidno.nisam za taj novac ocekivao neki kvalitet,ali moze mnogo bolje od ovoga,iskreno,uopste nisam zahtevan korisnik,samo sam realan...nije bas za preporuku... 27.06.2016 :: 13:14 h :: IP > 93.86.179.40 :: 1620946. Odlican telefon ,odlicno lezi u ruci,odlican odziv taca,odlicne boje displeja,zvuk odlican,odlican signal mreze,android 6.0 radi savrseno bez baova,lagova,seckanja.Baterija i do dva dana uz normalno koriscenje(malo igrice,mobilni net i wi fi po ceo dan upaljeni )KAMERA PREDNJA VRH SA BLICEM I ZADNJA TAKODJE ,sve pohvale za ovaj model odnos cene i kvaliteteta fantastican,odlicna kupovina,moja preporuka. 23.06.2016 :: 20:23 h :: IP > 109.93.58.138 :: 1620529. Telefon je stvarno odliÄan, super radi, ok je baterija, mogla bi biti i jaÄa, ali za sada dobra. Najbolji deo je prednja kamera koja ima blic. Lepo leÅ¾i u ruci, za sada jedina zamerka je to Å¡to, aparat za svaku stvar traÅ¾i neku dozvolu ili upozorava na neÅ¡to. Ako bude nekih dodatnih zamerki, napisaÄu. POP 4G OT-7070X - 237.

If you are considering buying this Smartphone then you must have realistic expectations - it's not an iPhone killer. Yes, it's a smartphone, but it's very basic. That's not to say it's a bad product, far from it! For the price, if you are looking for a simple, easy to use phone which has the basic smartphone functions of internet, facebook, whatsapp etc. then look no further but remember this is a phone for under £50 so don't compare it to one ten times the price. It has a nice shape, is lightweight and feels nice in your hand. It's made of a strong plastic, and feels very robust. The camera is nice and takes good quality pictures. I was very impressed with the screen resolution, it's bright and clear. It can feel a bit clunky when swiping through screens, but I say that as an iPhone user, it certainly doesn't make it unusable, just a little slower and less responsive than I am used to. Sometimes I do field work and this phone is excellent to have rather than worry about a more expensive phone. It might also be good for people travelling abroad - beware of roaming costs etc - but if you want a cheap phone that has wifi access for whatsapp and facebook etc then this would be perfect. It has a straightforward user interface and I am sure that anyone at any age would be able to work it. It's also good that it is SIM-Free as this means you can swap between networks and go with whatever is best for you. Overall, I highly recommend this phone. It's a basic smartphone but if that's all you need then go for it. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Good budget phone, don't expect frills.. Style: SIM Free | Verified Purchase. Very decent little phone, provided your expectation is 'My first smartphone' or 'A budget smartphone'. If you're wondering, I was able to play both Pokemon Go and Fallout Shelter, (both reasonably large games) on it. It was a bit sluggish with them, but they work. The phone feels pretty solid, which I found reassuring though some might prefer a more lightweight phone. I did however find a serious flaw with mine (and had to return it because of this). The back-case is very easily damaged in such a way as to make the power button useless. If you've had the phone a long time (and are thus out of warranty) this can be worked around by using apps like 'volume unlock' or by buying a replacement back. Mine came damaged this way, so I simply returned it. It's weird for such a sturdy phone to have such an easily damaged part, and I do think that is a major design fault. If you're needing a smartphone for basic apps, business etc... then this is a pretty decent phone. Not lightening fast, but not particularly slow either. A good first smartphone, or if you need a cheaper one for travelling with (or simply for frugality). Don't expect it to compete with more expensive smartphones, but it will get the job done.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Pleased with this phone for the money. Style: SIM Free | Verified Purchase. Ok it's not top range but it doesn't pretend to be. I am a basic, fairly low usage person of texts, calls, wifi and camera and this works perfectly for me, more than just adequate, It is very intuitive to set up and use, nice slim and lightweight mobile. Would recommend if like me you are not on your mobile all day and just need an easy but effective mobile. Instructions are not great but easily found better solutions to the odd query on the internet. I did a lot of research before buying this and find it is one of the best Smartphones for the cost to fit my needs.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great Customer Service!.
