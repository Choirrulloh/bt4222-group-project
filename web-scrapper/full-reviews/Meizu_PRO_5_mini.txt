Hope price is right to buy in USA!?! Its going around 400 $ in market. Finally a nice 4.7" phone to order.. Hope price is right to buy in USA!?!. If the design like an "edge mini" and the wide smaller than 65mm then it will be a good single handed and pocket friendly phone that i've waiting for so so long. No need to push to the very top spec and sell it under 300usd so that compact phone lovers no need to burn a hole at our pocket to buy the expensive snapdragon z5 compact.. I was actually rooting for Redmi 3 but its not 5 inch anymore and eventho its bang per buck but i was not satisfied with the design and size... this meizu has 4.7 and its almost bezel-less can you imagine how small that is? lol.

Twitter/Meizu Meizu Pro 5 is launched in China.. Chinese consumer electronics company Meizu launched their flagship smartphone Pro 5 back in September this year. It has been considered as the most interesting and most powerful device to date in their line. A few months after, rumors about a smaller variant called the Meizu Pro 5 Mini surfaced and a recent report says that it's coming sooner than expected.. According to Android Headlines , Li Nan, vice president of Meizu, previously said that the mini version of the Pro 5 may arrive in the earlier part of next year. However, there are rumors that it may not wait until next year for the device to come. The source pointed to a newly leaked piece of information in China which says that the Meizu Pro 5 Mini may arrive before the end of December.. China-based analyst Sun Changxu also said that Meizu has been working on launching a new all-metal device. There was no mention of the Pro 5 Mini but considering it has been the only device in the rumor mill lately, it may be possible.. detailed that the alleged Meizu Pro 5 Mini was found on a listing in a European online shopping site. It even came with price details and device specs. According to the listing, the said handset will cost Ã¢ÂÂ¬359.99 and it will be equipped with the new deca-core (TEN cores) MediaTek Helio X20 chipset. It will sport a 4.7-inch wide AMOLED display which is a full inch smaller compared to the Pro 5. It will also have a 1080p Full HD resolution.. Furthermore, the site noted that the mini will be equipped with 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage capacity which can be expanded up to 128 GB via microSD slot. There are also rumors saying that a 64 GB variant will be available.. There's no confirmation yet on the said device so it's best to take things with a healthy dose of salt. But Meizu is working on something and they might just bring it out before the year ends.. Televangelist Benny Hinn Admits Going Too Far With Prosperity Gospel in Wake of Billy Graham's Death.

Home Phones Meizu News There will NOT be a Meizu Pro 5 Mini anymore. Had your hopes set on a 4.7-inch Meizu Pro 5 Mini as the small screen flagship of your dreams? Well sorry because itâs not going to happen.. So it appears that Meizu were actually set to release a flagship phone with a smaller form factor but now those plans have been canceled! Why? Well Meizu are stating that their intended supply in Taiwan has been affected by the recent earthquake and stock that they were planning on using has been damaged. The disaster would set the Pro 5 Mini plans quite some time, so Meizu have simply decided to ditch the idea.. Weâll thatâs what HuangZhang and Li Nan have said on Weibo anyway.. Apparently Meizu will now use what they learned developing the Meizu Pro 5 Mini on the Meizu Pro 6 flagship instead.. This sounds a little off to us though. If Meizu had already got the screen stock confirmed we assume tooling and the production line for the Pro 5 mini were in place too. Surely they could have found another screen supplier, or was their screen size and ratio a little different from the norm like original Meizu phones?. So the Meizu Pro 5 Mini is no longer going to happen thatâs official, but we do know a Pro 6 is in the making and who knows perhaps we will get a Pro 6 mini instead?.

Back in September, the Meizu Pro 5 was introduced by the company. Featuring a 5.7-inch Super AMOLED screen , the handset is powered by the Exynos 7420 chipset. Yup, that's the same SoC that you'll find inside the Samsung Galaxy S6 , Samsung Galaxy S6 edge , Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ and the Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Now, Meizu is apparently going to offer a Pro 5 Mini, and the big news is that it just might be equipped with MediaTek's Helio X20 chipset.. According to a report published today, the Meizu Pro 5 Mini will be driven by the MT6797 SoC, which includes a deca-core CPU. Additionally, the phone is said to carry a 4.7-inch screen, with a 1080 x 1920 resolution. It will be offered with 32GB and 64GB of internal storage, priced at the equivalent of $315 USD and $394 USD respectively. It also will feature a metal build, like the full-sized Pro 5. Unfortunately, we don't have any other specs to throw at you for now. But there are quite a few things to look forward to down the road, such as benchmark tests, TENAA certification and more. Thanks for the tip! source: PhoneRadar. The rumored Meizu Pro 5 Mini is said to employ MediaTek's Helio X20 SoC, sporting a deca-core CPU.

Rumor: Meizu PRO 5 Mini To Sport Helio X20 SoC, Cost $315. November 2, 2015 - Written By Kristijan Lucic. Meizu hasnât exactly released a ton of devices this year, but the ones they did release, are quite compelling. This China-based company is one of the fastest growing smartphone OEMs in the world and they tend to release really affordable devices which are actually quite solid in both terms of build and performance. The Meizu PRO 5 is the companyâs latest flagship, and it was announced back in September. This handset is powered by the Exynos 7420 64-bit octa-core SoC, sports 3 or 4GB of RAM and packs a 21-megapixel camera on the back. The PRO 5 sports a ton of features, and is, overall, a really powerful phablet.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines â International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. That being said, it seems like Meizu might be preparing the smaller version of this phone, at least according to the newly leaked info. According to this leak, the Meizu PRO 5 Mini will sport a 4.7-inch 1080p display, while its bigger brother sports a 5.7-inch fullHD panel. The PRO 5 Mini will allegedly be available in 32 and 64GB variants, and will be fueled by the MediaTek X20 deca-core SoC. The source also mentions that the 32GB variant of this phone will cost 1,999 Yuan ($315), while the 64GB model will be priced at 2,499 Yuan ($394).. If this info is accurate, the PRO 5 Mini would be significantly cheaper than the PRO 5 which is priced at 2,799 Yuan and 3,099 Yuan for 32 and 64GB variants. As far as other specs on the PRO 5 go, it is quite probable that the device will sport the same 21-megapixel snapper the PRO 5 does, and it will almost certainly look the same as its bigger brother, but will be smaller, of course. Android 5.1 Lollipop will come pre-installed on this smartphone with Meizuâs Flyme 5 OS on top of it. You can also expect the physical home button to be located below the display, and for it to double as a fingerprint scanner. Meizuâs mCharge Quick Charging tech will be available here as well, and the device will almost certainly going to be made out of metal.. Thatâs pretty much it, we still donât have that much PRO 5 Mini info, this is the first time we hear anything about this device. If Meizu truly intends to release such a phone, you can expect it to arrive before the holidays.. Android Headliner: Are Motorolaâs Updates Fast Enough?.

Expect the next flagship to arrive later this year. Reader comments Load old comments. Meizu Pro 5 Mini Canceled Due to Earthquake, Company Now Focusing on Pro 6. The company claims the entire Pro 5 mini stock has been damaged. Meizu smartphones are a rare thing outside China, but they can still be purchased from any part of the world if you know where to look for them. Naturally, you will have to pay slightly higher than their retail price in China, but if you really want one, you can get it.. Unfortunately, the next smartphone that Meizu should have introduced on the market, the Pro 5 mini will never see the light of day. Even though Meizu already confirmed the smartphone and its release timeframe, the company's CEO announced the Pro 5 mini has been canceled.. So, if you've been waiting for the miniaturized version of Meizu Pro 5, you should look for an alternative since this one won't make it to the market anymore.. According to GizChina , Meizu CEO Huang Zhang confirmed on Weibo that due to the recent earthquake in Taiwan that affected their intended supply and stock that the company was planning to use has been irremediably damaged.. Because it would have taken at least several weeks for Meizu to replenish the stock, the Chinese company has decided that it's not worth spending more resources and time and completely ditched the idea of a smaller Meizu Pro 5.. On the bright side, the Chinese OEM announced that it would focus on its resources on developing its next flagship smartphone, the Pro 6.. While we don't have a timeframe for the release of Meizu Pro 6, there's a high chance that the smartphone will be introduced on the market this fall.. It's unclear whether or not Meizu will launch any other smartphone by that time, but since the company has been recently affected by the loss of Pro 5 mini stocks, there's little chance that will happen.. # Meizu Pro 5 Mini # Meizu flagship # Meizu Pro 6 # Meizu smartphone # Huang Zhang.

Meizu recently launched its flagship smartphone, the Pro 5 , featuring a 5.7-inch screen and all-metal unibody design. Even though the company didnât reveal any plans of launching a mini version of the handset, a new Meizu phone dubbed Pro 5 mini has been spotted on one of Europeâs online retail websites. The listing reveals price, specifications and features of the smartphone ahead of an official announcement.. Meizu Pro 5 mini price: The smartphone is listed for EUR 359.99, which translates to Rs 26,000 approximately..

It is powered by MediaTekâs 64-bit Helio X20 deca-core SoC and paired with 3GB of RAM. It has 32GB of onboard storage and a microSD card slot for further expansion. To recall, its elder sibling, the Pro 5 sports a 5.7-inch full HD display and is powered by Samsungâs Exynos 7240 octa-core processor with either 3GB or 4GB of RAM depending on the 32GB/64GB storage variant.. On the photography front, the smartphone sports a 16-megapixel rear camera and 5-megapixel front facing selfie camera. Running on Android 5.1 Lollipop, Meizu has also included its Flyme OS skin running atop. Other features such as dual-SIM 4G LTE, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS and 3,050mAh battery are also expected to be present..

Meizu Pro 5 Mini Release Date & Rumored Specs: To Feature Helio X20 Chipset. @AndroiAuth/Twitter #meizu's Pro 5 delayed due to factory flood. Chinese smartphone maker Meizu is launching a smaller variant of their recently released Meizu Pro 5 very soon. Dubbed as the Meizu Pro 5 Mini, the said smartphone is going to come with a few different and upgraded specs in comparison to its bigger variant.. Softpedia , is the display screen as the mini version of Pro 5 is will reportedly sport a 4.7-inch capacitive touchscreen in contrast to the 5.7-inch Super AMOLED of the company's latest flagship. It will still support the same 1080 x 1920 Full HD resolution, as well as the metal build just like the body of the Meizu Pro 5.. Another notable change is the processor that is going to be used. As reported by Phone Radar , the Meizu Pro 5, which arrived back in September, sports under its hood a powerful Exynos 7420 octa-core processor with 3 GB or 4 GB RAM. But the upcoming Pro 5 Mini will not follow the steps of its predecessor and use instead the Helio X20 deca-core processor.. The source mentioned that the chipset isn't finished with production yet but speculations are high that the mini version will, in fact, carry the MediaTek processor instead of the Samsung Exynos. It is said that the use of the Helio X20 deca-core processor will give quite a boost in performance, which is why its chipset is considered the device's main attraction.. The Pro 5 Mini is also said to be available in 32 and 64 GB variants with the former costing 1,999 Yuan ($315) and the latter priced at 2,499 Yuan ($394). While some of the mentioned specs are already confirmed by the Chinese regulatory commission TENAA, others remain as a rumor. Not a lot of details have been revealed about the handset yet but it is expected to be as impressive as the Pro 5.. Rumors say that it will be unveiled soon, probably before the year ends..

Meizu PRO 5 mini specifications include the might deca-core processor. 0 3 1 minute read. Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn StumbleUpon Tumblr Pinterest Reddit VKontakte Odnoklassniki Pocket. Remember the time when we said that we might not get to see a Helio X20 version of Meizu PRO 5 ? Turns out that we were wrong all along because according to a source, the next handset belonging to the company is going to be none other than Meizu PRO 5 mini. Meizu PRO 5 mini is going to feature a 4.7 inch screen size, and just like its 5.5 inch sized variant, it is going to feature the same resolution.. A major difference between both devices is that Meizu PRO 5 mini is going to feature MediaTekâs Helio X20 , which will easily be able to beat the likes of Exynos 7420 and Snapdragon 810 thanks to its deca-core processor. However, the deca-core processor is going to be running Cortex-A72 cores instead of Cortex-A57 ones, making the smartphone much more efficient than the original PRO 5.. My Drivers reports that the handset is going to come in two storage models; one will feature 32GB of on-board storage, while the other is going to have 64GB of internal memory. There is currently no word if the smartphone will have a microSD card slot but since Meizu PRO 5 had one, we are certain that the upcoming version will provide support for expandable storage as well.. There is also going to be a 16MP Sony IMX230 rear camera sensor, so we know perfectly well that Meizu PRO 5 mini will easily be able to record 4K videos with slowing down one bit. There is going to be fingerprint sensor present in the upcoming gadget, and the starting price is expected to be 1,999 Yuan, or $315.46 USD.. For a Helio X20 powered smartphone, Meizu PRO 5 mini is definitely a cheaper version of the Exynos 7420 model, but we will wait for more details to come through before we provide confirmation of this little price detail. If it does turn out to be true, then current generation flagship smartphones are going to be in a lot of trouble..
