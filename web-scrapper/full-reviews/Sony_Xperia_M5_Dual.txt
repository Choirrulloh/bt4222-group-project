By Vijaysanker Kartha | 22 Jan 2016. undI had purchased this mobile M5 on 9 Jan 2016 vide Invoice No. SLF02A011020102719 from Croma store Pune, Aundh., after using Sony mobile M5 very happily for Two years.. I think I made a mistake doing this. The battery life is being claimed to be 2 days by you. The M@ dual used to give me around 30 hours after a full charge. This one gives just about 9 or 10 Hours….. The mobile goes of for no reason unexpectedly anytime of the day or night, even when the battery has enough charge. Then the switch on button does not work. One has to connect the mobile to a charger or to a PC to switch on the mobile. This has happened around 10 + times in the last 13 days.. The mobile goes to one way communication, suddenly. The party cannot hear me and I can hear the party, irrespective of whether it is an incoming call or an outgoing call. And it remains this way until and unless the mobile is restarted. One App downloaded from Playstore, Paid app, used to work well on M2. but on this it repeatedly hangs. I had sent error reports on this may times. Is it possible for me to return this mobile? I had an option of buying Apple and I did not, due to the good experience I had with Sony M2.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 7 out of 7 people found this review helpful.

Please ask the question in above box. Does the primary camera work with 21MP resolution?. Better don't go for M5 because it has some hardware issues with the primary camera. Most of the times it says close the camera app in other application. But when it works you can choose manual mode and set 21 MP. But in my opinion, if you have not purchased it, then go for some other models.. Yes, of course even it can record 4k videos.. Yes, but the camera works very slow.. Does it have a hybrid slot?. No, it does not have a hybrid slot. You can use both SIMs and a memory card at the same time. But I suggest you not to buy because it is not worth the price. You can buy any other phone in same range of Rs. independent slot for two nano sims. and other for micro sd card.. We can use two sims along with memory card. So, it doesn't have hybrid slot.. No, It has a dedicated slot.. Yes, it is waterproof but I did not insist to take out this phone out of water after 20 minutes.. This is waterproof but when you close the speaker slot and headset jack. It is waterproof but when you close the speaker slot and headset jack. No, it can resist for sometime in low water conditions.. Yes, this is water proof mobile.. It heats up a little bit while you play heavy games or browse internet for a longer time. But it's not a serious issue.. Yes, it heats and also cool downs. It depends upon usage because it is packed and also waterproof.. Sometimes, when there is heavy usage of camera and gaming like nova 3 or asphalt 8.. Yes, but only in first few couple of days after that it works normally.. Similar to other smartphone and considering it is certified, it's OK.. Does it have fast charging option?. No, it does not support fast charging but the battery size is small. So, it can be charged in less time.. No it doesn't have such option. Even it takes 3+hour time to get fully charegd.

Sony Xperia M5 Dual Rating by MobileDokan. There are many cool features in this smart device from Sony. But the true strength of Sony Xperia M5 Dual that makes it different from other devices in the market, are its powerful front and back camera as well as dust and water resistant body. Hybrid autofocus, 5x clear image zoom, Superior Auto, Exmor RS™ will give the photo sharp focus, detailed color, environment adjustment and quality brightness. 4K / Ultra HD video (3840 x 2160 pixel) will let you capture professonal videos for your YouTube project or just for your own private collection. With an UHD TV, you can enjoy the videos at their best but also with Xperia M5's Full HD screen, it would be satisfactory to watch. Another interesting feature is the battery stamina mode. By activating this mode, you can dramatically increase the standby time of the device. Decent ROM, fast network (4G supported), RAM and CPU with attractive design (contains stainless steel corners) makes Sony Xperia M5 even more useful and suitable for the budget group..
