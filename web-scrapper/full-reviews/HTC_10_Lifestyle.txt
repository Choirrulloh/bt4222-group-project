The leak train has finally reached its last station as HTC has officially taken the wraps off the device.. Meet the HTC 10 , HTC’s flagship for 2016:. Starting off with the design, the HTC 10 makes refinements and changes to HTC’s previous flagships. You still get the metallic unibody with a very gentle curve starting from the middle and tapering towards the side edges. To make the phone stand out from the current flood of metal and glass smartphones, HTC has added on a chamfer all around the back edge, giving the phone a very distinct look indeed. You have the SIM tray on the right, along with the volume rocker and the ridged power button.. On the front is a 5.2″ QHD (2560 x 1440) Super LCD 5 display with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 on the top. Instead of virtual navigation buttons like previous HTC flagships, the HTC 10 comes with a home button-on-fingerprint scanner with capacitive backlit buttons for back and recents. The fingerprint scanner also sits visibly recessed on the main display.. Moving on to the inside, the HTC 10 is definitely a flagship of 2016, as it packs in all that you would expect. Except if you live in India and other such market areas (more on this towards the end). For the flagship variant, you get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 coupled with Adreno 530 GPU. You also get 4GB of RAM and internal storage options of 32GB and 64GB. If you wish, you can also expand this with microSD card support of. The HTC 10 also comes with a decent 3,000 mAh battery, which is non-removable unfortunately (a trade-off of unibody designs), but if you have been following HTC products, this is no surprise. Fortunately, you get a USB 3.1 Type C 1.0 port with Quick Charge 3.0, which claims to charge your battery by 50% in 30 mins.. For the software experience, you get a streamlined HTC Sense with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. HTC claims that they have worked with Google to get rid of duplicate apps, relying on more and more Google apps (which receive updates via the Play Store) instead of pre-installing their own apps as well like some other manufacturers are known to do. HTC is also including a freestyle layout form, which removes the on-screen grid interface on the homescreen. You get freedom to place icons, stickers , and widgets as per your liking without being restricted by a grid. You can also layer them and group them, or remove all of it entirely, which is neat for a stock out-of-the-box launcher. HTC has also attempted to populate the HTC Themes apps, so you hopefully get more good themes to suit your personal style. Also included in the software package is Boost+ , which is HTC’s take on a task killer [Hint: They are still bad and unnecessary ].. The camera on the HTC 10, often the weakest link in. various HTC flagships over the years, has seen an overhaul this year. HTC is still sticking with the UltraPixel moniker, which is a term to denote larger pixel size. The rear is a 12MP UltraPixel 2 camera with f/1.8. You also get laser autofocus and Optical Image Stabilization, and the ability to record 4K video with Hi-Res Audio, along with a Pro Mode for photography.. For the front, the HTC 10 comes with a 5MP camera with f/1.8 and an “ultra wide angle” lens. HTC has also brought the OIS love to the front camera, so that should definitely help in less blurry selfies.. So far, the HTC 10 is shaping up to be a very interesting package. With its current setup, it will be competing for the top spot. But there are a few caveats with the HTC 10.. For starters, the iconic BoomSound speakers are gone. In their place, you get a bottom facing speaker. HTC claims that the woofer resides on the bottom, with the speaker being on the top-front of the device. They both work in tandem to give a stereo experience, which HTC is calling the BoomSound Hi-Fi edition. But with the speaker scenario, HTC has indeed downgraded based on pure specs. We hope the hands-on experience with the audio is at par with previous HTC flagships, but we aren’t really holding our breath on it.. The second flaw with the HTC 10, will be a second variant. This particular HTC 10 variant, called the HTC 10 Lifestyle will not be a flagship, opting to be a glorified mid-end warrior instead. HTC has replaced and downgraded various key specifications for reasons best known to them. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 gets replaced in favor of a Snapdragon 652. The 4GB RAM gets a downgrade to 3GB, and the internal storage is restricted to 32GB (with expandability). Even the USB Type C cable gets a version downgrade from v3.1 to v2.0. Mind you, these are still good specifications which should satisfy the needs of a vast majority of users. But, if you want to be called a flagship, you have to be a flagship and not be a shadow “lite” version.. The HTC 10 will come in two variants with different Qualcomm ® Snapdragon™ processors to cater for different market needs. They will both offer the same design, audio, camera and display, with a similar software experience and battery life.. The HTC 10 Lifestyle will not be a choice. Some regions, like India (and other developing markets), will get the Lifestyle variant by default as they “different market needs”. If you are in the market for a true flagship and willing to shell out money for it, the HTC 10 will not be a recommendation in these regions. We recommend that you check which version is sold in your market before purchasing.. The HTC 10 will be available in four colors: Carbon Grey, Glacier Silver, Topaz Gold and Camellia Red. Pre-orders for the HTC 10 begin today in the US across major carriers, with shipping in early May. HTC will also be selling an Unlocked Edition at HTC.com, which will cost you $699 and comes with Uh-Oh protection. Availability of the HTC 10 Lifestyle is unknown at this stage..

HTC announces the midrange Desire 10 Pro and Desire 10 Lifestyle. Not every phone need achieve blockbuster status to be considered successful. There’s demand enough for phones at the margins, specifically for the sort of mid-range devices. that don’t sport the hardware or command the prices of high-end handsets. like the Apple’s iPhone, Samsung’s Galaxy S7, or LG’s V20 but nonetheless deliver good, if not great,. to market analysts at Gartner, they’re quite the crowdpleasers: 85 percent of users in Asian markets. are replacing their middle-of-the-road phone with the same category of phone. Unsurprisingly, it’s a segment manufacturers are happy to supply. smartphone manufacturer HTC is among them, and on Tuesday, it took the wraps off its latest efforts:. Desire 10 Pro and Desire 10 Lifestyle.. The Desire 10 Pro and Desire 10 Lifestyle feature an understated. “inspired by the Art Deco movement”: a sloping, curving unibody. with chamfered edges not dissimilar to HTC’s high-end HTC 10. It’s a familiar configuration of buttons and ports: on the bottom is a. micro USB charging port and single loudspeaker, on the top is a microphone jack, on. the left is a textured gold power button and bifurcated volume rocker, and around back is a single. camera sensor with a flash and sensor module.. That philosophy of simplicity extends to. Both the Pro and Lifestyle ship with the latest version of HTC’s Sense, an overlay atop Android 6.0 Marshmallow. As such, they feature HTC’s Freestyle Layout, a digital. grid that lets you place homescreen. widgets, stickers, and doodads anywhere you please. HTC Themes, HTC’s theming engine, which provides options to “thousands” of icons, backgrounds, sounds, and more.. But while the Pro and Lifestyle share a body and software in common, it’s. a different story under the hood. The Pro is the decidedly more premium of the two, sporting a 5.5-inch 1080p (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) IPS screen and an octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor paired with either 3GB or 4GB of RAM, depending on configuration.. The rear-facing camera is a 20MP, f/2.2 model that that sports, in HTC’s language, “DSLR-like controls”: electronic image stabilization, high dynamic range (HDR), and laser autofocus. The 13MP on the Pro’s front isn’t quite as well-endowed, but packs a bright flash and a Selfie Panorama mode that lets you. “[big] enough to fit a whole football team with room to spare.”. of cameras, though, the Desire 10 Pro doesn’t pack much else in the way of surprises. It has a 3,000mAh battery that HTC that. supports fast charging, plus a bass-boosting BoomSound audio profile for headphones and an “ultra-fast” fingerprint sensor that triggers selfies on demand. array of sensors including a ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, gyroscope, and compass. And its storage comes in the form of either. 32GB or 64GB internal modules, both paired with. cards up to 2TB in size.. The HTC 10 Lifestyle, meanwhile, compromises in some areas and excels in others. It trades the Pro’s 1080p screen for a 720p (1,280 x 720 pixels) model, and the octa-core processor for a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400. The RAM’s a bit of a downgrade, too, from. The battery’s a tad smaller at 2,700mAh. And both cameras on the Lifestyle. capable sensors than those on the Pro: 13MP on the rear (down from 20MP), and 5MP f/2.8 on the front (from 13MP f/2.2).. Audio’s a step up, for one: the Lifestyle sports. BoomSound technology as that of the HTC 10 — 24-bit Hi-Fi audio with Dolby Audio certification and a. most of the sensors on the Pro, including an ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, gyroscope sensor, and compass, are present and accounted for on the Lifestyle.. “HTC’s Desire line has always stood for fresh, youthful, and fashionable designs that are focused on delivering a great experience,” HTC President of Smartphones and Connected Devices Chialin Chang said in a statement. Desire line is about to make its biggest leap since the original Desire. Inspired by many of the same innovations that have made the flagship HTC 10 so popular, we’re bringing these innovations to the Desire 10, making it the most brilliant Desire ever.”. Historically, the handsets that have graced HTC’s Desire lineup have been equal parts exceptional and mediocre. But the Desire 10 Pro and Lifestyle appear to be an exception to the rule, and if the prices are right, HTC may well have a pair of smash hits on its hands.. Both the Pro and Lifestyle will be available in black, white, blue, and “Valentine Lux” when they ship. to European, Middle Eastern, and Asian markets later this year.

May 1997 ; 20 years ago. Xindian District , New Taipei City , Taiwan. Wikimedia Commons has media related to HTC Corporation. Wikimedia Commons has media related to HTC Service. For other uses, see HTC (disambiguation) .. Headquarters in Xindian, New Taipei City, Taiwan. Cher Wang , (Chairwoman & CEO). Peter Chou , ( Vice Chairman ). Fred Liu, (President of Engineering and Operations). HTC Corporation ( Chinese : 宏達國際電子股份有限公司 ; pinyin : Hóngdá Guójì Diànzǐ Gǔfèn Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī ) (High Tech Computer Corporation) is a Taiwanese consumer electronics company headquartered in Xindian District , New Taipei City , Taiwan. Founded in 1997, HTC began as an original design manufacturer and original equipment manufacturer , designing and manufacturing laptop computers. After initially making smartphones based mostly on Windows Mobile , HTC became a co-founding member of the Open Handset Alliance , a group of handset manufacturers and mobile network operators dedicated to the development of the Android mobile operating system. [4] The HTC Dream , marketed by T-Mobile in many countries as the T-Mobile G1, was the first phone on the market to run Android.. HTC later shifted to marketing its own devices, including the HTC One series. In 2011, HTC ranked as the 98th top brand on Interbrand 's Best Global Brands report. [5] A September 2013 media report stated that HTC's share of the global smartphone market is less than 3 percent. While rising back to 7.2 percent in April 2015 due to its strong sales of recent devices, its stock price had fallen by 90 percent since 2011, and the company experienced consecutive net losses. In 2016, HTC expanded into virtual reality hardware with the release of HTC Vive .. In 2017, HTC announced a $1.1 billion deal with Google, wherein Google acquires a non-exclusive license to intellectual property of HTC as well as a transfer of 2000 employees, mainly tied to the Pixel phone lineup. Cher Wang (王雪紅), H. T. Cho (卓火土), and Peter Chou (周永明) founded HTC in 1997. [8] Initially a manufacturer of notebook computers , HTC began designing some of the world's first touch and wireless hand-held devices in 1998. [9] The company is credited with creating the first Android smartphone , the first Microsoft-powered Windows CE smartphone with Siemens Mobile (2002) and the first Microsoft 3G phone (2005). Their first major product, one of the world's first touch-screen smartphones, appeared in 2000. As an ODM for HP and Palm , HTC built the HP iPAQ and the Palm Treo 650 .. In 2007 HTC acquired the mobile-device company Dopod International. In October 2010, HTC launched the brand tagline "quietly brilliant" , and the YOU campaign, HTC's first global advertising campaign. In June 2010, the company launched the HTC Evo 4G , the first 4G -capable phone in the United States. [12] In July 2010, HTC announced it would begin selling smartphones in China under its own brand name in a partnership with China Mobile. [13] In 2010 HTC sold over 24.6 million handsets, up 111% over 2009. In 2011, HTC started working with Luxgen. Luxgen vehicles are engineered to 'Think Ahead' for their drivers. Armed with advanced technology designed by Taiwan's global smart phone leader HTC, Luxgen vehicles are equipped with a suite of advanced features to preempt road conditions and potential hazards. All Luxgen vehicles feature a state of the art onboard computer system, dubbed the 'Think+', which, for the first time ever, combines HTC smart technology and Windows CE Automotive interface. At the Mobile World Congress on 16 February 2011, the GSM Association named HTC the "Device Manufacturer of the Year" for 2011. [16] In April 2011, the company's market value surpassed that of Nokia , making HTC the third most highly valued smartphone-maker in the world behind Apple and Samsung. On 6 July 2011, it was announced that HTC would buy VIA Technologies ' stake in S3 Graphics , thus becoming the majority owner of S3. [18] [19] On 6 August 2011, HTC acquired Dashwire for $18.5M. In August 2011, HTC confirmed a plan for a strategic partnership with Beats Electronics involving acquiring 51 percent of Beats' shares. The 2011 Best Global Brands rankings released by Interbrand , listed HTC at #98 and valued it at $3.6 billion. [22] [23] Based on researcher Canalys, in Q3 2011 HTC Corporation became the largest smartphone vendor in the U.S. with 24 percent market share, ahead of Samsung's 21 percent, Apple's 20 percent and BlackBerry 's 9 percent. HTC Corporation made different models for each operator. During early 2012, HTC lost much of this U.S. market share due to increased competition from Samsung and Apple [25] According to analyst firm comScore , HTC only accounted for 9.3% of the United States smartphone market as of February 2013. [26] In light of the company's decrease in prominence, Chief Executive Peter Chou had informed executives that he would step down if the company's newest flagship phone, the 2013 HTC One , had failed to generate impressive sales results. [27] HTC's first quarter results for 2013 showed its year-over-year profit drop by 98.1%, making it the smallest-ever profit for the company—the delay of the launch of the HTC One was cited as one of the factors. [28] In June 2012, HTC moved its headquarters from Taoyuan City (now Taoyuan District ) to Xindian District , New Taipei City. On 14 January 2013, HTC launched its smartphones in Burma , which will come with the world's most advanced Burmese language on-screen keyboard. In August 2013, HTC debuted a new "Here's To Change" global marketing campaign featuring actor Robert Downey, Jr. , who signed a two-year contract to be HTC's new "Instigator of Change." On 15 August, HTC began airing the new marketing campaign on YouTube , prior to the campaign's appearance in television and cinema advertising schedules. On 27 September 2013, HTC announced that it sold back its entire stake of Beats (24.84 percent) to Beats Electronics. The company will close the deal in Q4 of 2013 and expectsa US$85 million pretax profit. The 2013 HTC One was released in mid-2013 and, subsequently won various industry awards in the best smartphone and best design categories, but global sales of the HTC One were lower than those for Samsung's Galaxy S4 flagship handset and HTC recorded its first ever quarterly loss in early October 2013: a deficit of just under NT$ 3 billion (about US$100m, £62m). Marketing problems were identified by HTC as the primary reason for its comparative performance, a factor that had been previously cited by the company. Following the release of the HTC One, two variants were released to form a trio for the 2013 HTC One lineup. A smaller variant named the HTC One Mini was released in August 2013, and a larger variant named the HTC One Max was released in October 2013. Similar in design and features to the HTC One, the upgraded aspects of the One Max include a display measuring 5.9 inches (15. cm), a fingerprint sensor and a removable back cover for expandable memory. [33] The product was released into the European and Asian retail environment in October 2013, followed by a US launch in early November 2013. In March 2014, HTC released the HTC One (M8) , the next version of the HTC One flagship, at press conferences in London and New York City. In a change from previous launches, the HTC One was made available for purchase on the company website and North American mobile carrier websites on the same day a few hours after the launch. In April 2014, HTC reported sales climbing 12.7 percent to NT$22.1 billion, the company's fastest growth since October 2011. [36] In September 2014, Google selected HTC to make its Nexus 9 tablet. On 1 March 2015, HTC unveiled Vive , a virtual reality head-mounted display in collaboration with Valve Corporation. [38] [39] In June and October 2015, HTC reported net losses; the company has faced increased competition from other smartphone makers, including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics , and other newcomers, which had resulted in a decline in its smartphone sales, as well a major loss of market share. [40] On 30 September 2016, HTC globally launched Viveport, its VR app store focused on non-game VR experiences. On 12 January 2017, HTC unveiled the HTC U Ultra and the HTC U Play, the first two devices in its new U series of smartphones. On 16 May 2017, HTC announced the U11 , the successor to the previous year's HTC 10.. Main articles: Smartphone patent wars and Apple v. In March 2010, Apple Inc. filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission claiming infringement of 20 of its patents covering aspects of the iPhone user interface and hardware. [42] HTC disagreed with Apple's actions and reiterated its commitment to creating innovative smartphones. [43] HTC also filed a complaint against Apple for infringing on five of its patents and sought to ban the import of Apple products into the US from manufacturing facilities in Asia. [44] [45] Apple expanded its original complaint by adding two more patents. On 10 November 2012, Apple and HTC reached a 10-year license-agreement covering current and future patents held by the two companies. The terms of the agreement remain confidential.. In February 2013, HTC settled with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission concerning lax security on more than 18 million smartphones and tablets [47] it had shipped to customers [48] and agreed to security patches. HTC's chairwoman and acting CEO is Cher Wang who is the daughter of the late Wang Yung-ching , founder of the plastics and petrochemicals conglomerate Formosa Plastics Group. [9] Peter Chou serves as head of the HTC Future Development Lab, [50] and HT Cho as Director of the Board and Chairman of HTC Foundation. [51] HTC's CFO is Hui-Ming Cheng. [52] In addition to being chair of HTC, Cher Wang is also acting chair of VIA Technologies. [9] HTC's main divisions, including the IA (Information Appliance) engineering division and the WM (Wireless Mobile) engineering division, are ISO 9001 / ISO 14001 -qualified facilities. The company's growth has accelerated dramatically [ clarification needed ] since being chosen by Microsoft as a hardware platform development partner for the Windows Mobile operating system (based on Windows CE ) [ citation needed ]. HTC also works with Google to build mobile phones running Google's Android mobile OS such as the Nexus One. [54] HTC's sales revenue totalled $2.2 billion for 2005, a 102% increase from the prior year. In 2005 it was listed as the fastest-growing tech company in BusinessWeek s Info Tech 100. HTC has invested strongly in research and development , which accounts for a quarter of its employees. [8] The company's North American headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington. [56] HTC runs a software design office in Seattle (near its North American headquarters) where it designs its own interface for its phones. [57] In 2011, HTC also opened a research and development office in Durham, North Carolina , a location the company chose over Seattle and Atlanta , [58] to focus on multiple areas of wireless technology. HTC focuses on its customer service. In the UK, US, India, and other countries the focus on service has increased and with the opening of various service points for customers, service has improved. [60] HTC is investing and continually improving on its customer service support in India and other growing markets. On 17 February 2010, Fast Company ranked HTC as the 31st most innovative company in the world. [62] Bloomberg reports that HTC is considering its own mobile operating system to compete with Apple's iOS , Google's Android , and Microsoft's Windows Phone. [63] On 27 May 2011, in response to customer feedback, HTC announced that they will no longer lock the bootloaders on their Android based phones. On 21 September 2017, HTC announced a transaction with Google, in which it will acquire a portion of HTC's smartphone business for US$1.1 billion. This purchase covers the acquisition of non-exclusive licenses to certain HTC intellectual property, and selected HTC employees (including, in particular, those who assisted in the production of Google's Pixel smartphone , which was manufactured by HTC).. The company intends to maintain a smartphone business following the sale; HTC CEO Cher Wang stated that this "cooperation agreement" would "ensure continued innovation within our HTC smartphone and Vive virtual reality business". And according to Rick Osterloh from Google, HTC employees have been "working with closely on the Pixel smartphone line, and we're excited to see what we can do together as one team." [65]. Google will use the purchase to bolster its in-house hardware business. [66] [67] [68] In December 2017, the Taiwanese Investment Commission has approved the deal. [69] On 30 January 2018, the transaction was completed. HTC sponsored the HTC-Highroad professional cycling team from 2009 to 2011. In 2012, HTC became the official smartphone sponsor of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. [72] The contract will last for three years and makes HTC one of the main sponsors of the two competitions. HTC also became the shirt sponsors for the Indian Super League franchise NorthEast United FC for the 2014, 2015 and 2016 season. HTC is the sponsor of Punjab -based Indian Premier League franchise Kings XI Punjab. HTC sponsors professional eSports teams Team SoloMid , Cloud9 , Team Liquid , and J Team , (formerly known as Taipei Assassins ). HTC sponsored a Super Smash Bros. Melee tournament, HTC Throwdown, which was held on 19 September 2015, in San Francisco. [76] At the end of 2015, the company also sponsored the creation of that year's SSBMRank, the annual rankings of the best Melee players in the world. ^ a b c d e "HTC CORP (2498:Taiwan Stock Exchange): Financial Statements - FT". ^ "Smartphone maker HTC to cut 15% of staff". ^ "HTC Desire 526 price, specifications, features, comparison". ^ "Google unveils cell phone software and alliance". ^ 2011 Ranking of the Top 100 Brands Archived 2011-10-06 at the Wayback Machine. ^ a b Yu-Huay Sun; Edmond Lococo (27 September 2013).

Does it support volte after nougat update?. Bonji, 22 Sep 2017 Blunder Rich Phone from HTC. I have an m8 with 1080p display super lcd its just super good. more Hi bro please can you suggest me that is it good phone or not bcoz I want to buy this phone it is available for just 23k only. I have an m8 with 1080p display super lcd its just super good. Sunlight legibility is a problem with all LCD's but overall its ok. What HTC has done wrong here is the snd 600's need to render only 1080p display. This 1440p display is of no use in a midranger. The screen size could be just 5" too with about 3000mah battery this could have had supreme battery life optimum performance and not to mention the audio quality is fantastic with htc. Poor means really humungously poor thinking by HTC. In a country like India mid range smartphones which are handy with one hand 1+ day battery wont be flashy @ launch but will have really good consistency and people would have sticked on to the brand. V v v v poor marketing and thinking HTC. ash, 16 Sep 2017 yes ,it is available in india Ty bro for reply but seems To be doubt That it is available on Amazon flipkart and at other sites but no any review on you tube and no any description about phone given below on HTC 's website so little bit confused.
