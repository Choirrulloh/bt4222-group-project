Single Review, online available, Short, Date: 03/08/2017. HTC One S9 is a mid-range phone that borrows the same good looking design from the previous HTC One M series and some aesthetic features from the HTC One A9. The smartphone has an elegant finish and good workmanship to it. HTC has modernized the curved unibody design and added a brushed metal finish. The One S9 weighs at 158g and is 144.6 x 69.7 x 10.1 mm in dimension. With these kind of dimensions, it isn't exactly a thin and light smartphone but the looks makes up for it. It comes pre-installed with Android OS v6.0 Marshmallow operating system and runs the HTC Sense user interface.. Inside, there is Mediatek MT6795 Helio X10 Octa-core 2.0 GHz Cortex-A53 processor coupled with the PowerVR G6200 graphic processing unit (GPU),. 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that can be further expanded by up to 256GB using a microSD dedicated slot. HTC One S9 sports a 5-inches Super LCD capacitive touchscreen that is capable of displaying up to 1920 x 1080 pixels resolution with 441 pixel density. The screen is layered with Corning Gorilla Glass to add some strength and scratch resistance. Like all Super LCDs from HTC, the One S9 has good brightness but fails to deliver it under direct sunlight. It has communication features such as WI-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac (2.4GHz and 5.0GHz), Wi-Fi Direct, DNLA, hotspot, Bluetooth version 4.1, GPS with Assisted GPS (A-GPS) and The BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS). Other additional features found on HTC One S9 include ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, accelerometer, compass sensor, gyro sensor and magnetic sensor.. For a mid range smartphone, the HTC One S9 truly shines in the camera department. It has a 13-megapixel f/2.0 camera on the rear and it is equipped with auto focus, BSI sensor, Optical Image Stabilizer (OIS), Bicolor LED flash and face detection. The camera is also able to record videos in 1080p resolution at 30fps and 720p resolution at 120fps. On top of the features mentioned, HTC One S9 also allows for a Pro Mode shoot, an enhanced camera mode which will store the images in RAW format. These kind of configuration is usually found in high end devices that cost much more such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 and LG G5. There is a secondary 4-megapixel camera with 2 micron pixels on the front. This camera comes with a variety of selfie software package for the common selfie moments. The lens for both cameras are made from sapphire crystal to make them resistant to scratches.. The smartphone comes with HTC Boomsound with Dolby Audio Surround. It does perform quite well and it beats many flagship smartphones with speakers on the rear. HTC One S9 is available in 2 different colours; gold and silver and has a non removable 2840mAh battery. The downside of the smartphone is that it does not have a fingerprint sensor which is something that has become a necessity even in the budget friendly range. In short, the HTC One S9 is a decent looking smartphone with decent specs for a low-mid range device but since this category is flooded with many interesting devices, it really needs more to go for the current asking price.. This is a typical smartphone diagonal.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. High Tech Computer Corporation (HTC) is a Taiwanese manufacturer of mobile phones and other electronic products. In 2012, HTC stopped producing tablets under their own name. In 2012-2013, they faced heavy sales declines. Since then, the company is medium-sized in the smartphone sector. There are numerous reviews on HTC Smartphones (as of 2016)..

Stephen Schenck April 26, 2016 10:33 am. Right now, we’re still just a couple weeks removed from HTC’s last big smartphone launch, with the debut of the HTC 10. But as shoppers get ready to welcome that new flagship into their lives, we’re already learning about even more HTC hardware. Just yesterday we checked out some of the first evidence to arrive for the Desire 830 , and while we’re still waiting for that model to go official, today we’ve got another new HTC handset that’s already launching, as HTC reveals the One S9.. As the phone’s name should help clue you in, the One S9 has a lot more in common with the design of last year’s One M9 than it does this year’s HTC 10, returning with that bevel-less back and square camera.. The One S9 runs a MediaTek Helio X10 SoC, has 2GB of RAM, 16GB storage, and supports microSD expansion. The phone has a 5.0-inch 1080p LCD, 13MP main camera with OIS, and 2MP front-facer. At its thickest, the handset measures just over 10mm thick, and has a mass of 158 grams. A 2840mAh battery powers the phone.. All that adds up to a package that falls quite a bit short of the super-premium HTC 10 experience, but should suffice for shoppers with mid-to-upper mid-range needs.. So far we’ve spotted HTC Germany advertising the phone for about 500 EUR, and presumably we’ll similarly see it land in other European nations. So far, though, we’ve yet to get full details on HTC’s retail plans.. Source: HTC Germany Via: GSM Arena. Android , HTC , News , One S9. Android , HTC , News , One S9.

HTC One S9 Brings 5-Inch Full HD Display, Octa-Core Processor, And Premium Metal Body To Mid-Range Smartphone. 28 April 2016, 7:15 am EDT By James Geddes Tech Times. HTC appeared to drop its "One" branding when it launched the HTC 10. The company has just announced the latest member to its lineup with the full-metal jacket mid-range HTC One S9.. HTC just released its 2016 flagship smartphone, the HTC 10 , which it is currently selling unlocked via its online store. The smartphone is expected to go on sale in early May in the U.S. recently announced that it would be the first wireless carrier in the U.S. to offer the HTC 10 and is opening up preorders for the smartphone on April 29.. Before HTC 10 was officially launched, the smartphone was believed to continue the "One" series and be named HTC One M10. HTC might have put the HTC 10 into its own series, but it found time to introduce a new "One" smartphone. The company has just launched the mid-range HTC One S9, which features a design similar to that of the One M9 (minus front-facing BoomSound stereo speakers).. The HTC One S9 boasts a 5-inch 1,920 x 1,080 Full HD Corning Gorilla Glass display with a pixel density of 443 pixels per inch. HTC chose to use a 2 GHz octa-core Mediatek Helio X10 processor, PowerVR G6200 GPU, and 2 GB of RAM. The handset ships with Android 6.0 Marshmallow and updated version of HTC Sense.. The HTC One S9 includes 16 GB of internal storage and a microSD expansion slot that will support up to 2 TB additional space. The handset features a 13-megapixel rear camera with autofocus, optical image stabilization, dual-tone flash and a 4-megapixel front-facing camera for video chat and selfies.. HTC includes a large, non-removable 2,840 mAh battery that will provide up to 13 hours of talk time and 658 hours of standby time. Its dimensions are 5.7 × 2.7 × 0.4 inches, and it weighs 5.6 ounces.. has only been announced for the European market at this point and there's no word on when or if it will be released in the U.S. As always, we'll keep you informed on any new HTC One S9 news as it happens..

HTC One S9 - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 4 ». - good price - 290 Euros;. - decent hardware and software response;. - drop't it a few times, except for some scratches it's okay (also in water with detergent (powered on));. - very low quality materials: the metal back is made from soft aluminium, scratches instantly, the glass scratches extremely easy;. - Charges fully in about 2h;. - pretty good phone for the price.. The device is very pleasing , l am happy with it.. I have this phone for a while now.. - Battery life is less than average, browsing the internet on Wi-Fi for one hour decrease the Battery 28%. - build quality is not great despite being metal back.there is a seem between the metal and the plastic and between the plastic and the screen. - Not comfortable to hold in my hands. -camera is average for a mid-ranger, no thing special. I can not recommend it for use as a primary phone , the battery is slow to charge and fast to drain.. It's too heavy (even comparing to LG G3 with 3000 mAh battery and a 5.5-inch display with 4K resolution), it doesn't fit well in one hand in spite of being a 5-inch phone (Sony XA fits well), and its camera is located at the worst place possible. It overheats when connected to the internet (both 4G network and Wi-Fi; just being connected, even when not browsing) or being charged. It makes me feel like I'm holding a Sony Ericsson P990: heavy, uncomfortable, and expensive. Do not make the mistake I made.

How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. HTC One S9 looks like the One M9, acts like a One A9. JC Torres - Apr 26, 2016. HTC decided to stir things up a bit by giving the HTC 10 a makeover. While the end result does have merits, its previous flagship design might have enchanted loyal followers for years. The good news, HTC hasn’t completely killed that design off and it is flaunting it again in the newly unveiled HTC One S9. The bad news, it only shares the One M9’s design. Everything else reveals a mid-range smartphone that shares more in common with the controversial HTC One A9 , with a few caveats, of course.. Perhaps it’s actually good that it only inherited the One A9’s specs, or some of it, and not its looks. That 2015 mid-range smartphone was heavily criticized for how it was a clearly, though vehemently denied, “inspired” by the Apple iPhone 6 design. In stark contrast, HTC’s One flagships bore a very distinct design language very few, if not none, have even bothered to copy. Whether that’s a good thing or not is a different question. At least for fans of the design, that lives on in the One S9.. Not that they would probably want to buy one (get it?) simply for its design, especially considering the specs inside. The One S9 is powered by MediaTek’s 2.0 GHz octa-core Helio X10, which is on the same tier as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 in the One A9. RAM is fixed at 2 GB and storage is a measly 16 GB, like the One A9’s lowest configuration. The screen? A 5.0-inch Full HD one, again like the One A9. Only difference here is Super LCD for the One S9 and AMOLED for the One A9. Fortunately, the One S9 also inherits the One A9’s cameras, which translates to a 13 megapixel f/2.0 sensor with OIS on the back and an UltraPixel camera on the front.. Of course, there are differences as well. The battery, for example, is much larger at 2,840 mAh. Sadly, inheriting the One M9’s overall design also left no space for a fingerprint scanner.. While the specs are on par with a decent mid-range smartphone and while its design makes it an interesting grab, the price tag might very well scare buyers off. In Germany, the HTC One S9 will sell for 499 EUR. Even when not converted to its $564 equivalent, you can already tell that it’s way more expensive than your average midrange. Given than, we can only surmise that the “S” in its name means “stylish”, “steep”, and “strange”, all at the same time.. Topics Android HTC HTC 10 HTC One A9 HTC One M9 Phones smartphone.
