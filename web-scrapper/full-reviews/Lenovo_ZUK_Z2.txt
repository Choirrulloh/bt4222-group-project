The Lenovo Zuk Z2 is a Chinese smartphone that packs a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, fingerprint scanner and pin-sharp 5-inch screen.. It runs Android 6.0.1 underneath a custom ZUI user interface and boasts a 13-megapixel camera on the rear that’s capable of capturing 4K video; on the front there’s an 8-megapixel selfie camera.. Remarkably, all of this tech comes in for less than £200. Lenovo is already famous in the realm of computers and its recent acquisition of Motorola has bolstered its standing in the smartphone arena – which makes the launch of the China-only Zuk range all the more puzzling. Despite the fame of its brand, Lenovo has declined to feature its logo on the Z2; it clearly wants the Zuk name to stand out on its own.. Although it retails for less than £200, the Zuk Z2 has the kind of build quality you’d expect to find on a handset that costs twice, maybe three times as much.. There’s 2.5D glass on the front and rear, which rounds off neatly along the edges and appears to have some kind of coating that keeps greasy fingerprints to a minimum.. There’s no denying that the Z2 feels great in the hand, but the flat and glossy back panel mean that it slides off pretty much every surface you place it on, so it might be advisable to invest in a protective case.. The edge of the device feel like plastic, but it’s actually metal covered in a matte material to increase grip. The power and volume keys are fashioned from plastic and can be found on the right-hand side of the phone.. The only other physical input is the home button, which doubles as a fingerprint scanner and is situated below the screen. This button feels a little cheap when pressed and certainly doesn’t give the same reassuring “click” you’d get from a Home button on a Samsung or Apple device.. Despite the cheap feel, the Home button hides some neat tricks. Swiping from right to left switches to the last-used application, while swiping from left to right takes you in the opposite direction. This allows you to multi-task and toggle between apps without having to drop back to Android’s dedicated active app screen (which is accessed by double-clicking the home button if you so wish).. A single tap on the home button – not a full press – acts as the “back” command. It works really well once you become accustomed to it..

With dimensions of 8.5 x 142 x 69mm, this is quite a compact device – when placed next to the iPhone 7 , there isn’t much difference in terms of overall size. The Z2 is a lot lighter, however, coming in at just 149g. This gives it heft without feeling cheap and insubstantial. On the bottom edge you’ll find the USB Type-C port, 3.5mm headphone socket and mono speaker. The SIM card tray is found on the right-hand side of the phone, and accepts two nano-SIMs – a common feature on phones intended for the Chinese market. There’s no microSD card slot; the phone comes with 64GB of storage as standard, which should be more than enough space for the typical user.. The Z2’s IPS 5-inch screen has a resolution of 1,080 x 1,920 pixels, giving it a PPI of 414. The LTPS screen is similar to the one used in the iPhone 7, and you can expect comparable performance but a higher overall resolution. It doesn’t have quite the colour reproduction an iPhone does, but considering the price you’re getting a good panel here.. Images look sharp, colours are replicated well, and legibility in sunlight is excellent. Brightness can be jacked up to impressive levels too, again something rarely seen on more affordable handsets.. Viewing angles are also rock-solid and there isn’t any banding – odd colour movement – when you tilt the phone.. The Z2 runs Android 6.0.1 right out of the box, which is the norm for most modern Android phones – only the likes of the Google Pixel XL are lucky enough to have Android 7.0 at the moment.. The custom ZUI interface is clean and unoffensive, as well as being refreshingly light on bloatware. In fact, the phone lacks a large volume of apps on startup, with many core Google services missing. The app drawer is also missing – a common trait with Chinese Android phones.. The software installed on my review unit was flashed by the Chinese reseller that sent the phone, and has been set up very much with an international buyer in mind.. Google Play Store support is included, so grabbing the likes of YouTube, Google Mail and Google Drive isn’t an issue, but there’s no way to update the phone’s firmware.. Presumably this option has been omitted because Lenovo’s OTA updates don’t work outside of China, but it’s a rather extreme workaround – it means that out of the box, the Z2 will never receive any automatic updates. I also noticed annoying bugs, such as downloads randomly hanging in the Google Play Store.. As is often the case with Android, it’s relatively easy to flash the official Chinese ROM, switch the language to English and source APK files for core Google apps, thus solving these irksome issues.. However, casual users might find this process a little intimidating, and flashing ROMs always carries a risk; you could potentially brick your shiny new phone.. Alas, these are unavoidable quirks when you’re importing a mobile from abroad. As is the case with the vast majority of Xiaomi’s products, the Z2 simply isn’t intended for use outside of the Asian continent.. Next Battery life, camera, performance and verdict.

Marcus Herbrich ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 07/31/2016. Android ARM Smartphone. A lot of smartphone for little money. With the second generation of the Z series, ZUK continues where the Z1 model left off: Very good technical specifications at a low purchase price. Only a handful of manufacturers manage a Snapdragon 820, 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of ROM for 270 Euros (~$302). Find out in our report where Lenovo's subsidiary brand ZUK had to make cutbacks..

Due to the increasing competition in the high-end smartphone sector, the Chinese company ZUK has set up a special price-performance bundle. The purchase price is difficult to guess just based on the technical data of ZUK's Z2 - Qualcomm's. Snapdragon 820 , 3500 mAh battery and a 5-inch FHD IPS panel are some configuration features for a price well below 300 Euros (~$335; importers). 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of ROM are also a significant amount of memory for a smartphone that is situated in the price range of a mid-range handset.. Compared to the pro model, ZUK's Z2 does not support the LTE band 20 that is important for Germany. Furthermore, it is not possible to upgrade from the eMMC 5.1 to the faster UFS 2.0 storage (128 GB version).. Despite the low purchase price, potential rivals have to be looked for in established brands from the premium range in Germany. We will use the following comparison devices in the test: the. Xiaomi Mi 5 is also a direct rival of ZUK's Z2 since Xiaomi's smartphone also scores with a very good price-performance total package.. Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 MSM8996 Qualcomm Adreno 530.

Both the front and back of ZUK's Z2 are made of scratch-resistant glass, which merges into a metal frame in a lightly curved 2.5D bezel. Both glass plates give the smartphone a high-quality appearance, but they also reduce the device's grip considerably. Compared with other smartphones with a glass back, such as. Samsung's Galaxy S7 , the Z2 feels much sleeker. The block-like shape increases the smartphone's restricted flexibility even more. ZUK seals its smartphone with an anti-fingerprint finish to prevent finger marks. Although grease residues were visible on our tested white version, they were not as aggravating and rather less noticeable than on comparable devices.. The dimensions of 141.7 x 68.9 millimeters (~5.6 x 2.7 in) and a screen diagonal of 5 inches result in a screen-surface ratio of almost 71% for ZUK's Z2 - a rate similar to the comparison devices in the test. The handset's stability is very good. However, the build of the keys for volume control and power on the handset's right are not on par with devices from the premium range. We found these buttons too wobbly in our review sample, but their pressure points were well-defined.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. With 64 GB of internal eMMC 5.1 memory, ZUK's Z2 offers plenty of storage for personal data, such as photos or music files for a handset in this price range. After deducting the operating system the user has approximately 53.17 GB at their disposal. It is not possible to expand the storage of the dual-SIM smartphone.. ZUK's Z2 features the modern USB Type-C port on the handset's lower edge. However, it only supports the USB 2.0 standard. Furthermore, the Z2 is equipped with a fingerprint scanner and an LED for new notifications.. The Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system as well as the manufacturer's ZUI user interface in version 2.0 is preloaded. ZUK does not install an app drawer in its smartphone, and the various apps are arranged on the home screen. The Z2's user interface hardly looks like Google's Vanilla UI â rather, we discovered elements from Apple's iOS mobile operating system, such as the appearance of the setting menus, multitasking view or the shortcut at the screen's lower edge.. Since the Z2 was initially intended for the Chinese market, ZUK's smartphone does not support any Google services ex-factory. The only language options are English and Chinese..

The Z2 features Bluetooth version 4.1 for wireless communication between mobile devices. The manufacturer does not install an NFC chip. Furthermore, ZUK's smartphone supports the use of. However, only one slot supports LTE Cat. 6 - this high-speed mobile network standard achieves up to 300 MBit/s in downstream and 50 MBit/s in upstream. The second SIM card is limited to 3G connections.. The Wi-Fi module supports the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n and ac standards. The reception performance is very good and the Wi-Fi signal is stable in routine use. The attenuation of just under -30 dBm is low next to the router (Telekom Speedport, W921V). The average data transmission rates at one meter (~3 ft) away from our reference router (Linksys EA8500) are very good with 311 Mbit/s (transmit) and satisfactory with 154 Mbit/s (receive)..

The navigation systems GPS, BeiDou, and GLONASS are supported for localization, and functioned very fast with an accuracy of 3 meters (~10 ft) in the outdoors. The signal quality was too weak indoors and thus no satellites were found. We ride our test route by bike and compare the total distance of the GPS module in ZUK's smartphone with that of Garmin's Edge 500 GPS bike computer. Although there are slight deviations in the route, the measured difference of 30 meters (~98 ft) between the two devices is very small.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

The voice quality of the Z2 is good in both directions - both the contact as well as the caller `could hear each other distinctly. The quality of the installed microphone was praised, particularly in video calls. Distracting side noises were not produced. We performed the test calls via Skype and the German Vodafone mobile network (D network).. The phone app's layout is simple and straightforward, and offers all the standard functions. However, sometimes Chinese layout was displayed even though the system language was set to English (e.g. number suggestions or Yellow Pages menu).. The rear-facing 13 MP camera offers a wide aperture of f/2.2 and a phase detection autofocus that the manufacturer specifies with a focus time of 0.1 seconds. The image sensor (1/2.6") comes from Samsung (ISOCELL technology), and each pixel has an edge length of 1.34 millimeters (~0.05 in). Furthermore, a dual-LED flash and optical image stabilizer (OIS) are also installed.. The photo quality of ZUK's Z2 is very good considering the price. The dynamic range is sufficiently high so that bright and high-contrast photos with good image sharpness are produced (scene 1: surroundings). A visible image noise is created in low-light conditions, and the blurriness in the photos increases (scene 3: night). Overall, the Z2's photo quality is good, but it cannot compete with. in terms of sharpness, image details, and brightness.. The front-facing camera has a resolution of 8 MP and an aperture of f/2.0. The photo quality for selfies is satisfactory. Colors are reproduced well, but the resulting photos often do not look sharp enough.. ZUK's smartphone records Ultra HD resolution videos (3840x2160 pixels, 30 FPS) maximum. Slow motion videos at up to 960 FPS in 720p can also be recorded. The video resolution drops to 1080p at 30 FPS when using the 8 MP front-facing camera.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. ZUK's Z2 comes with a modular power supply, USB cable, and a manual in Chinese.. The manufacturer's warranty is 12 months.. The Z2 is not operated via the commonly used Android onscreen buttons for "Back", "Multitasking", and "Home" or their capacitive counterpart below the screen. ZUK's smartphone can only be controlled via the physical-capacitive home button. In addition to fingerprints for unlocking the handset, the main control detects predefined gestures. For example, the home button is only tapped for a fraction of a second for "Back" and somewhat longer for "Multitasking". Applications can be changed via swiping left to right over the capacitive home button. Applications are scaled down and the home screen opens when the physical button is pressed down. Although this operating concept is rather strange at first, it is not less effective than the traditional navigation in Android after some getting used to.. The virtual keyboard "Sogou" and Googles standard model (QWERTY layout) are available as onscreen input devices. QWERTZ layout) can be downloaded from the Play Store.. The 5.2-inch screen has a Full High Definition resolution of 1920x1080 pixels and a pixel density of 424 PPI. Individual pixels are not visible even when looking closer.. The maximum brightness of ZUK's Z2 on a pure white screen background is a very good 538 cd/mÂ². We also examine the brightness when white and dark areas are distributed evenly (APL50) in the test. We determined a brightness of 526 cd/mÂ² here. We measured a luminosity of 512 cd/mÂ² with enabled, adaptive ambient light sensor for controlling screen brightness.. 538 cd/m² 512 cd/m² 474 cd/m² 525 cd/m² 512 cd/m² 463 cd/m² 521 cd/m² 516 cd/m² 453 cd/m². 84 % Center on Battery: 512. cd/m²) ΔE Color 3.8 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 2.7 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.09.

The black level of 0.58 cd/mÂ² (APL50 rate: 0.58 cd/mÂ²) is clearly higher than the rates of some rivals with an IPS panel, and results in an only mediocre contrast ratio of 883:1. Subjectively and objectively, the screen's color reproduction convinces us (display mode: warm). We assess the IPS panel with a spectrophotometer and the professional CalMAN software. Compared with the sRGB color space, the average DeltaE deviation in colors (3.8) is close to the ideal (<3). The rates for both grayscale deviations and gamma are even below the target rate of 3.0 and 2.2.. CalMAN ColorChecker (target color space: sRGB), display mode: standard.

Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. The SoC in ZUK's Z2 is Snapdragon 820 MSM8996. from the USA-based chip manufacturer Qualcomm. The SoC designed for 2016 carries 4 CPU cores from the proprietary Kryo architecture. Two cores clock at a maximum of 1.6 GHz and the other two at a maximum of 2.15 GHz. Qualcomm's SoC alongside 4 GB of RAM displays its potential in the benchmarks and meets the Android opponents eye to eye. are the performance leaders in graphic-driven benchmark tests. The results of the browser test are also very good in total, although slightly lower than current flagship devices - apart from. ZUK implements an "Overclock Mode" for somewhat higher performance in its smartphone. Enabling this mode leads to short performance boosts via overclocking the processor from its maximum of 2.15 GHz to 2.30 GHz. This only has a marginal if any impact in the benchmarks during the browser tests. The biggest boost was recorded in Google's Octane V2 (+8%).. The performance of the internal eMMC storage is not on the good level of other high-end devices - the manufacturer has made some cutbacks here and does not rely on a modern UFS 2.0 storage. Compared with mid-range devices that have a similar purchase price as the Z2, the access times of ZUK's smartphone is quite satisfactory (see for example.

Even demanding games such as " N.O.V.A 3 " or " Need for Speed No Limits " can be played smoothly using high settings. The well-functioning sensors further contribute to a good gaming experience.. The surface temperatures made a good impression in the test. ZUK's smartphone only heats up marginally in idle mode and during low load. We even measured just 39.8 Â°C (~104 Â°F; rear) during maximum load as the hottest spot.

The Z2's mono speaker is situated behind milled drill holes on the casingâs lower edge. The sound quality is good, and the maximum volume of 85 dB(A) is typical for smartphones. The sound impression hardly shows any noteworthy distortions; as expected, basses are absent..

The power consumption of ZUK's Z2 is satisfactory for a high-performance smartphone based on a high-end SoC and 4 GB of RAM. However, the manufacturer could optimize the idle power consumption in particular - a comparison with. shows the possibilities despite a much larger screen.. Off / Standby 0.03 / 0.26 Watt Idle 1.31 / 2.03 / 2.08 Watt. mAh Power Consumption Idle Minimum * Idle Average * Idle Maximum * Load Average * Load Maximum *. The Z2 is equipped with a large 3500 mAh lithium ion battery. ZUK's smartphone places itself in the upper third among the rivalling devices with 9 hours and 6 minutes in our practical Wi-Fi test using a brightness of 150 cd/mÂ². Considering the battery capacity and screen size, the runtimes are good but could still be improved.. ZUK's Z2 is fully recharged in approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes with the included 13.25-watt power supply (5.3 V; 2.5 A) and Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0.. NBC WiFi Websurfing Battery Test 1.3 9h. + very good price-performance. + 4 GB of RAM. - availability/no LTE band 20 support. The Chinese manufacturer ZUK does a good job in many respects with its Z2 model. Firstly, the high-quality casing made of metal and glass and the generously sized memory (4 GB of RAM, 64 GB of ROM) in addition to the high-performance. - and all that at a street price of roughly 270 Euros (~$302; importers). Furthermore, the Z2 features one of the most innovative home button implementations in the Android market. Whether this is an advantage or disadvantage is a matter of personal taste - we liked the handling concept.. Does ZUK's Z2 connect to the premium smartphones with this? Not in our opinion considering that too many cutbacks have been made in order to achieve the price. Starting with the internal storage - ZUK only relies on the "slower" eMMC 5.1 memory instead of the faster UFS 2.0 storage. The primary camera strikes with high light yield and good image quality, but it does not achieve the standard of current premium smartphones. Furthermore, the configuration list has been slimmed down somewhat (no LTE band 20 support, no NFC) and the manufacturing quality (dedicated buttons) could be improved in some places.. ZUK's Z2 is a very good smartphone in a very good price-performance bundle. If the price is not the most important thing and the restrictions involved with an import device can be accepted, we would recommend looking closer at. - although it is slightly more expensive (32 GB model), it offers a better total package in our opinion..

By faizauthar12 , Recognized Developer / Contributor on 15th October 2017, 09:06 AM. AICP 13.1 z2_plus, ROM for the Lenovo ZUK Z2 (Plus). ROM OS Version: 8.x Oreo. ROM Firmware Required: ZUI 3.5. AICP is known by everyone as the "Ice Cold Project" that started on a Desire HD years ago (2012) and since then has evolved into a mature ROM with the BEST community that you can find!!!. Until Lollipop, the Rom has always been based on AOKP. Unfortunately, since AOKP stopped development (but made a comeback later), we changed our base to CM. With the re-brand of CM to LineageOS (LAOS) we are now LAOS based with some tweaks from AOSP. If there are any bugs, either we will sort them out or the LAOS team will if it concerns their code base. This rom isn't LAOS supported, so no need to report errors/bugs to them!!. In the beginning we would like to thank:. @Maxwen and the rest of the OmniRom team. plus the rest of the crazy bunch that we call "team". We are paying for servers that build nightlies/weeklies and everything that comes with it, so EVERY DONATION will really be appreciated and be used to cover those expenses. Latest Stable Release Version 13.1. we're recommending you guys to use beansgapps bcuz it's stabiltiy https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CyUh99f8893eYHxYkPgZHvr1caH8z9Sc/view. The ROM should contain everything you need to enjoy Android Oreo. You don't need to install any Add-on's, simply download the latest ROM, GApps, flash it and go!. If you want the device to run the ROM "rooted", you can flash a root solution of your choice after the ROM Zipfile. It is STRONGLY recommended to fully wipe your device before flashing and please avoid restoring system apps and system data with Titanium Backup as this can cause stability issues that are very hard to debug. If you believe you know what you're doing - then fine, go ahead, but please don't complain if you experience any strange behavior. (Again: Don't do it if you don't know it!). Download the ROM and GApps and transfer them to your device. Wipe the System, Cache, Data and ART/Dalvik cache. Flash the GApps (optional, needed for e.g. Flash the root solution of your choice (optional). The ROM has GApps persistence in between dirty flashes, so you only have to flash them once!. The root solution should be flashed together with every OTA update (= ROM Update) as long as the instructions of your. root solution do not state something else (="persistence on dirty flashing") !. The kernel in this ROM follows LAOS source with custom additions. To be able to flash using the built-in OTA app, TWRP recovery is needed. You can still use the LAOS recovery and OTA app, but you will need to download the zip file and flash it manually from within your recovery. The Zipfile gets saved in the "aicp_ota" folder on your internal storage. Please be sure that you are on the latest TWRP recovery. Keep in mind that this could also be an unofficial version!. If you want to contribute to the AICP or want see what is being worked on/merged, feel free to visit our Gerrit code review system. (mention all the devs who have contributed to your device tree, kernel, vendor, etc,. only mention the main ones though, probably the top four or so, otherwise this list will be a mile long unless if you're a huge kanger xD). ROM OS Version: 8.x.x Oreo. You want to see a "normal" night at the "DEV office", click here !!. * Your warranty is now void.. * We are not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards,. * thermonuclear war or you getting fired because the alarm app failed. * do some research if you have any concerns about features included in this ROM. * before flashing it! YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if. * you point the finger at us for messing up your device, we will laugh at you. Can I have an ETA for the next build?. Yes, just look in the OP to see if your device is built on a nightly or weekly schedule. Does this ROM support custom kernels?. You can still use them, but discussion should go in the thread of the respective kernel. We don't offer support for bugs you might encounter while using them!. Why doesn't this ROM support Xposed?. Xposed is a hack that is geared towards AOSP, custom ROM's modify the framework a lot, so Xposed can cause a ton of issues on custom ROM's. Now it might work for you, however it is not to be discussed in this thread, and you should refrain from posting bug reports. Alright, but I still want to flash Xposed, so which version do I need to install?. Xposed is not yet available for Oreo. What do I need to know before flashing?. Check the install instructions in the first post... Can the builds be dirty flashed over each other?. Yes, however make a nandroid backup first as there is a chance of getting a bootloop or encountering bugs. Also bugs may only be reported on a clean flash. How do I dirty flash builds?. Wipe the System, Cache and ART/Dalvik cache. Flash the ROM, GApps (only needed if you wipe the system), your preferred root solution and reboot. Or just use the OTA app to preform that task for you. How do I flash kernel builds?. If it's a .img file, boot into TWRP and go to the install page in TWRP, in the bottom right corner select "install image", select the desired kernel, then select "boot", then swipe to flash, then go back to the install screen and install your root method again, if you don't want to loose root and reboot. If it's a flashable ZIP, you can flash it together with a ROM update or separately. Go to the install page in TWRP, choose the kernel zip (or add it to the flash queue right after the ROM zip). Then add your root method to the queue if you don't want to loose root. Now swipe to flash, and then reboot. How do I enable software buttons?. Go to Aicp Extras/Navigation bar, and enable it. I installed a bad theme and now I'm getting a bootloop, how do I fix it?. In TWRP, flash the substratum rescue zip that's in the substratum folder on the internal storage. I keep losing root with Magisk, how do I fix it?. If that doesn't work for you, ask for help in this thread, read or ask in the Magisk thread on XDA or just re-flash Magisk!. I'm having issues with WhatsApp, how do I fix it?. Do I need to provide a logcat if I'm reporting a bug?. If you want it to be fixed faster (or at all) then yes, you should definitely provide a logcat. (Note: Please just link the logcat from your GDrive, Dropbox, etc. and do not post the content here. How do I get a logcat, what type should I get and more questions that can conveniently be answered by my pre-determined answer?. Also, here's a good app for getting logs: https://play.google.com/store/apps/d....tortel.syslog (Root needed). If you are already rooted, you can use the built-in feature to make a logcat and provide that. Just look into the root section in the AICP Extras menu..

Grab a logcat right after the problem has occurred. (Please include at least a few pages of the log, not just the last few lines, unless you know what you're doing.). If the problem disappears after running "setenforce 0" from a root shell, grab /data/misc/audit/audit.log. Remember to provide as much info as possible. The more info you provide, the more likely that the bug will be solved. Please also do not report known issues. A) Go to Settings > About phone, and press five times on Build number. Q) How can I enable root access?. A) Go to Settings > Developer options > Root access, and enable it for apps, adb or both. Q) How do I update GApps? (Also useful if you have GApps related problems). Wipe System, Cache and Dalvik Cache. Q: i got an error while flashing. A: it's okay, just ignore them. The Following 26 Users Say Thank You to faizauthar12 For This Useful Post: [ View ].

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. Lenovo's Yoga 730 is a cheaper 2-in-1 with Alexa support. The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. Sony will sell its wireless 'open-ear' buds in the US. Tesla's electric trucks may be more cost-effective than expected. Lenovo's ZUK phone puts other Chinese flagships to shame. The ZUK Z2 Pro has top specs, syncs with iCloud and is surprisingly affordable.. ZUK, a Chinese smartphone brand that you may have already forgotten about , has recently joined the ranks of Moto and Vibe to become Lenovo's latest mobile sub-brand. That wasn't the plan when Lenovo started restructuring its mobile division last year, but now it's included the startup to make its earlier investment worthwhile. Which is a good move, given how awesome and good-looking the freshly-announced ZUK Z2 Pro turned out to be. The company emphasized that its new 5.2-inch device makes full use of Qualcomm's 2.15GHz, quad-core Snapdragon 820, so it also comes with speedy UFS 2.0 storage of up to 128GB, LPDDR4 RAM of up to 6GB, USB 3.1 connectivity with Type-C port, Cat 6 LTE, dual Nano SIM slots and Quick Charge 3.0 -- you'll want that for the big 3,100 mAh battery.. Gallery: Lenovo ZUK Z2 Pro | 14 Photos. Alas, the Z2 Pro has left out NFC for some reason, but that shouldn't bother mobile payment users in China who are more used to in-app payments, such as AliPay, WeChat, JD and Bestpay. These can all take advantage of the Z2 Pro's front-facing fingerprint reader which apparently tolerates wet fingers, and it also has self-learning ability to increase reading accuracy. As part of ZUK's Android-based ZUI 2.0, you can customize various finger gestures -- including single tap, double tap, horizontal scrolling and long press -- to perform specific tasks using the fingerprint reader.. One of the main focuses of the Z2 Pro is fitness, so first and foremost, it's equipped with a bright 5.2-inch 1080p Super AMOLED screen -- shielded by a piece of 2.5D Gorilla Glass 3 -- that goes all the way up to 500 nits for outdoor usage, though it can also dial down to just 1 nit for night time reading. It also features 100 percent NTSC and sRGB color gamut, as well as a near-invisible 0.05mm-thick black border around the screen.. ZUK says you won't have to worry as much about potentially dropping the phone while you go running with it, as it features a ThinkPad-inspired rollcage design -- there's a shock-absorbing layer between the curved glass backside and the 4.6mm-thick metallic mid-frame. But of course, there's still no guarantee that this will prevent the glass pieces from shattering upon impact.. On the back, you'll find an optical heart rate sensor that can also measure oxygen saturation. For those who get bored easily, ZUK's added a fun but gimmicky feature that lets you use this sensor to take a selfie and also add a heart-shaped label showing your heart rate at the time, which can be fun for when you're taking selfies with your idols or just any friend. But going back to health and fitness, the Z2 Pro also does more precise activity tracking by taking uphill movements and running cadence (as opposed to just steps) into account. The main camera there also serves as a 15-level UV detector, which can come in handy when you're about to head out for a run on a sunny day.. Speaking of cameras, the main one features a Samsung 13-megapixel 1.34um sensor with a bright f/1.8 aperture, PDAF, optical image stabilization and dual-tone flash. ZUK added that its new phone does a much better job at stabilizing video shots than the iPhones, but we'll believe it when we've tried it ourselves. As for the front camera, it uses an unknown 8-megapixel sensor with slightly larger 1.4um pixels, a reasonable f/2.0 aperture and a smart beautification mode that can apply the right amount of enhancement by detecting your gender.. Last but not least, we're rather amused by the fact that ZUK has added the ability to let the Z2 Pro sync with Apple's iCloud, which should makes lives much easier for users who are migrating from an iPhone to this Android phone. But whether this will work as smoothly as advertised or whether Apple will put a stop to this remains to be seen. At least it made us smile during the keynote.. To our delight, the Z2 Pro's elite edition (6GB RAM with 128GB storage) will cost just 2,699 yuan or about $420, and it's available for pre-ordering in China tomorrow. ZUK cheekily pointed out that the maxxed-out Vivo Xplay5 with near-identical specs costs 4,288 yuan, which got a loud cheer from the audience. Similarly, even Xiaomi's Mi 5 Pro with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage is also asking for 2,699 yuan, and LeEco's top-spec Le Max 2 (6GB of RAM and just 64GB of storage) will only save you 200 yuan. But if this is still too much for you, ZUK will also be offering a cheaper "flagship edition" Z2 Pro with just 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, but there's no price announced just yet for its May 10th pre-ordering.. According to a company spokesperson, ZUK does have plans to continue serving its European and Middle Eastern markets (they've been mostly online), but we'll have to wait and see if these prices will match, and also whether it'll continue partnering with Cyanogen for its international devices.. Update: Well, here comes the party pooper. Lenovo's PR rep just reached out to say that the Z2 Pro is just for China and "will not be for sale in EMEA.".

Lenovo ZUK Z2 Pro starts receiving Android 8.0 Oreo. Lenovo's sub-brand ZUK which has evidently faded away is still receiving support for its phones.. Published: Saturday, December 16, 2017, 16:00 [IST]. In a rather surprising turn of events, Lenovo's sub-brand ZUK which has evidently faded away is still receiving support for its phones.. Well, a new update has reportedly just been released for Lenovo ZUK Z2 Pro smartphone. Interestingly, the new update brings Google's latest version of Android, Android 8.0 Oreo for ZUK Z2 smartphones. The update is said to be rolling out in China.. As of now, it seems that update is exclusive to Chinese users. We are yet to hear from the company about a global release. Or it could happen in the coming days.

Android Oreo also comes with a hots of features like the picture-in-picture mode, new Notification Channels framework, an autofill framework, Smart Text Selection, the option to snooze messages and reminders, rebuilt background doze optimizations for battery consumption and a lot more.. All in all ZUK Z2 Pro device owners in China are lucky as very few smartphones have received the 8.0. Many smartphones from top brands are yet to receive the update. Lenovo deserves some praise for this. The company is also said to release Oreo updates for several of its smartphones in the coming days.. ZUK, which was launched 2015 but it saw an early death a few months ago. Lenovo had said that they were discontinuing the brand as they had plans to reinvent their smartphones series by diverting their focus in launching phones under the Motorola name..

I would like to know, to replace the screen, is it necessary to disassemble the Z2 from the back, or can the screen be removed from the front? It would be awesome if you could give some instruction for screen replacement as I can’t find anything on the web.. October 31, 2016 at 9:37 am. To replace the screen, you need remove most parts from the phone.. November 18, 2016 at 6:53 am. Do you have a guide which explains how to replace the screen only ?. November 18, 2016 at 8:23 am. Sorry! the ZUK Z2 has been out of our office for a long time.. November 25, 2016 at 10:37 am. Well, I took the plunge, bought a replacement screen (in the frame) from AliExpress, and fixed my phone. It seems to work perfectly! I couldn’t have done it without your teardown, so thanks again. The job took me about 2 hours and I’m pretty much new to this sort of work. A couple of notes: first, my speaker module had 8 screws, not 5 as you reported. Maybe a different hardware revision? Second, I’d really recommend that anyone who wants to do this should buy the screen in the frame. It’s US$10 more, but it means you don’t have to muck around with removing the broken glass from the frame etc. The frame came with copper and graphite sheets and adhesive in the right places, so it was really convenient.. November 30, 2016 at 12:39 pm. Could you please share which display you bought? There are many sellers but I really want to have the adhesive etc. December 1, 2016 at 7:42 am. In my previous comment I included the URL where I bought my display, but it’s been removed. I wonder if I broke some site rule by posting it? So without posting any URLs: I got it from a vendor called “Mobile Good Helper”, the listing is called “For Lenovo ZUK Z2 LCD Display Touch Screen Digitizer Assembly With Frame Original Replacement Parts”, it’s US$55, and the manufacturer is called “Eachway” (which looks like “achway” because the ‘E’ is highly stylised and doesn’t look like part of the name). One thing: it would probably be a good idea to contact them before buying, and make very sure that they have the thing in stock. I had to muck around with them a bit because they originally said they’d dispatched it when they didn’t even have it in stock. All up it took about 3 weeks to get it.. December 1, 2016 at 1:34 pm. Thanks, found it! I also scratched the frame on all corners so this one is perfect! The glass is broken but digitizer still functional. Ordered one and I will follow the teardown as soon as I received the display.. December 2, 2016 at 8:25 am. I didn’t have any real problems, the scariest part was getting the ribbon cable for the fingerprint sensor off. I protected the sensor itself with tin foil and heated the frame from the front, and it ended up coming off pretty easily. Let us know how you get on!. January 5, 2017 at 9:11 pm. Hi front glass its equal to the digitizer? its possible to replace only the front glass? without changing the LCD? or it is glued to the LCD? thnaks. January 9, 2017 at 12:40 am. Replace the front glass is very hard, replace the display assembly is ok.. January 24, 2017 at 10:21 am. I connected a pushing beast 3.0 cable to an aukey quickcharge 3. Any idea on how to fix that?. March 24, 2017 at 11:18 pm. I’d like to ask once again about replacing only touch panel is it possible without loca glue and special UV lamp? Thanks in advance. April 17, 2017 at 1:14 pm. I do not not how the remove the speaker. I am talking about the small silver rectangular thing which appears to be the back of the speaker. It is depicted in the picture below “Here’s Lenovo ZUK Z2 chassis.”. The replacement screens at usual shops do not seem to have this item and therefore, I suppose it needs to be transferred. May 26, 2017 at 3:14 am. Hi so I dropped my phone and it landed on the front. Now there is no touch response on the middle of the screen. I think the digitizer is broken. I already ordered a new front panel with LCD + digitizer to replace this.. Also the GPS stopped working shortly afterwards. Now I don’t get a lock on my GPS anymore. Should I replace the GPS/Wifi board to fix this? or is this a software issue?. Leave a Reply Cancel reply. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *.

O que posso fazer pra está recebendo ?. Comments( 0 ) Helpful? ( 3 ) ( 0 ). Good Gadget for Phone Enthusiast By: felixdoell 2018-02-12 05:11:39. Price - Performance wise one of the best phones on the market.. Phone itself is manufactured nicely and without any flaws (maybe beside the ON/off, Louder, quieter buttons on the right which are bit "loose" - but no deal breaker!!!). The OS needs some attention, love and care, but with some help of the very active community even the "normal user" is capable to get this phone running perfectly smooth. I highly recommend this phone each and every phone and android enthusiast! For those kind of people,. Only contra so far: I miss the micro SD Card slot for (almost) unlimited memory ;).
