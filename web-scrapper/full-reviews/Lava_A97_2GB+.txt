First for Amazon Awesome service quality, I booked this product on 31st Dec, and they moved my product from Bangalore to Kolkata even on 1st Jan, and delivered on 2nd Jan morning before I left for work. Awesome Amazon!!! Now for Lava Not a good product, you don't sell a product which fails to start in first attempt. After I managed to start the phone, I see a flood of worthless useless Chinese apps preinstalled. Now I need to clean them up wasting my time. This makes no sense, And I don't like this approach. I opted for Lava, as I am still using my 3 year old Lava IRIS X1 with its awesome battery backup and beautiful service. Not sure how this one will stand its service but I don't recommend others buying this phone.
