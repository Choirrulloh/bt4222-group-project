Esto también se puede leer en español.. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good Nokia's Asha 503 has a sturdy, eye-catching design that's entirely pocketable and easy to use one-handed. It's Wi-Fi capable, packs in a camera flash, and won't break the bank.. The Bad Poor screen quality on the Asha 503 makes reading the display unpleasant. The camera's fixed-focused lens takes mediocre photos, and speakerphone volume is too low to be useful. The Bottom Line Its surprising design is the best thing about the Nokia Asha 503, but if you're looking for a traditional smartphone experience, its underperformance will only disappoint... Nokia's photogenic Asha 503 runs the company's alternative OS. It isn't slim, but the straight sides mean this phone can stand up on its own. A slightly curved backing makes it comfy to hold. Pop off the back cover to get to the microSD card slot. Think of Nokia's Asha 503 as a feature phone experience and you'll come closer to enjoying it for what it is: a delightfully square-edged handset with well-rounded, if clunky, capabilities. The phone's strengths include a well-thought out ice-cube design effect, Wi-Fi, and software features that will keep you connected.. The $99 unlocked global smartphone's low-quality, low-resolution screen, iffy call quality, fixed camera focus, and jerky navigation are markers of the 503's budget status, even as it's the most generously appointed among a trio that also includes the Asha 502 ($89) and Asha 500 ($69). (For reference, the Asha 503 tops the 502 with a stronger Gorilla Glass screen topper and 3.5G data speeds.). The 503's wacky, colorful, frozen-in-ice design is its saving grace, however, and the main reason I'd recommend the phone at all. If you want an easy-to-use feature phone with a statement design, the 503 is an OK choice. But if it's a smooth, well-integrated budget smartphone experience you're after, skip over the 503 entirely in favor of an inexpensive Android or Windows Phone.. Get a load of the Nokia Asha 503's ice-cube aesthetic (pictures). Design and build Well, it certainly has personality. Perfectly smooth with straight plastic edges and square corners, the Asha 503 stands upright on flat surfaces and looks like it's been frozen in a block of ice. The effect is most noticeable when peering down from above or catching an edge, a layer of clear plastic trapping the white, black, or eye-searing yellow, green, cyan, and red underneath.. At 4 inches tall by 2.4 inches wide by 0.5-inch thick, it's far from wafer-slim, but doesn't come across as overly chunky. Instead, it feels reassuringly solid, with a slight curve on the back softening the phone's sharper edges. You can easily slide it into pockets, and it's comfortable in the hand and on the ear. Those straight sides make it particularly grippable. Its 3.9-ounce weight is about right, too.. I also really like using the volume rocker and power button, both situated on the phone's right spine. They rise from the surface and are easy to identify by feel. The 503's Micro-USB charging port and headset jack are up top, and peeking out from the back cover are the camera lens and LED flash.. You'll need to take off the back panel (from the bottom) to reveal the microSD card slot, but it's the battery that needs to go for you to get to the micro-SIM card tray.. Looking at the 503's face, you see a lot of black. The bezel is huge, far larger than necessary for the 3-inch QVGA LCD display -- with 320 x 240-pixel resolution -- that it frames. Highly reflective, the touch screen can be hard to read indoors. It helps when you increase the brightness, though that comes as a cost to battery life.. More importantly, the phone's low 134ppi pixel density and 262,000 color capacity (versus 16 million) are impossible to ignore. Text and images appear a little jagged around the edges, even without scrutinizing the screen. Graphically-rich sites such as CNET look like a caricature with the low-quality image setting you get by default, with highly pixelated edges, blotchy color, and aliases sprinkled across the screen like confetti. Better stick to the mobile sites, or increase the image quality, at the cost of downloading speed.. The phone's display quality is a concession to its price, but at least Nokia gives you the Glance screen for seeing the time from the lock screen, and the option to double-tap the display to wake it up (another slight battery drain).. A 3-inch display is a very tight fit for reading the screen, closing out tiny windows, and especially for typing on the five-row virtual QWERTY keyboard. I found myself pecking at the screen very precisely, which worked OK with my smaller-size fingers, but it still frustrated me. The phone offers predictive typing by default, but no autocapitalization or autopunctuation. If you want spell-check, you'll need to turn it on in Settings yourself.. OS and apps The 503 runs Nokia's Asha software platform 1.1.1, which Nokia calls a smartphone OS. Without splitting too many hairs on the technicalities of what does or does not constitute a smartphone, I will just say that for anyone used to Android, Windows Phone, or iOS, the Asha OS feels like a blast from the past, more advanced feature phone than anything else. There's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 3.0, which you can access from a swipe-down menu at the top of the screen.. Navigation couldn't be easier from the single button -- a Back button -- beneath the display. After that, you swipe across two home screens: one holds your icons and the other shows an overview of your social stream and activities.. There are a fair number of apps with Asha, and a store where you can browse through more titles. The phones comes with text, of course, as well as a music player, Facebook, Twitter, and What's App, plus e-mail support for a number of protocols. There's a calendar, a calculator, a note app, a voice recorder, and an FM radio. You can manage files, access games, chat, and check the weather. Nokia preloads almost a dozen game trials that'll let you play for 3 minutes before promoting you to buy.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition....

About Nokia Asha 503 Dual SIM. Nokia Asha 503 Dual SIM – Revolutionizing the people perceive Budget Smartphones. Nokia Asha 503 Dual SIM is a remarkable budget phone by leading Finnish multinational telecommunication company – Nokia. Its release was initially announced on 22nd October 2013 and was designed as a successor to previous Asha model Nokia Asha 502. It should be noted that the company's mobile device subsidiary was taken over by Microsoft on 25th April 2014 while its prevalent operating system was revamped in order to compete with the company's Windows Phone series. Despite the model current high popularity in many countries including Philippines, company officials have indicated the Nokia Asha series & Nokia X lineup are intended to be wholly replaced by the Windows smartphones.. Nokia Asha 503 Dual SIM has been provided with a custom designed operating system – Nokia Asha Platform. Its user interface bears resemblances to that of other similar Smartphone platforms such as – Maemo, Symbian, MeeGo etc. It was designed by leading software professional Peter Skillman & his team who had previously also designed MeeGo for Nokia N9 series. One should also note that this operating system was developed as a valid successor to Linux based Series 40 under the project code named – Meltemi.. Nokia Asha platform however lacks the multi tasking feature which enables users to run or operate several applications simultaneously. One should also note that the user can run apps like radio & music in the background while performing other tasks, which is being often advertised as multi tasking (but in essence they are not). Nokia Asha 503 Dual SIM features a newly developed notification center – labeled as Fast lane. It is a collection of applications which act as alerts for notifications, messages etc. However, one should also take note that Fast lane closes all other previously running apps in place of minimizing to the tray.. Nokia Asha 503 Dual SIM offers a 2 finger multi touch 265K color, 3.0 inch TFT capacitive touch screen display which has a screen resolution of 320 x 240 pixels. It has an approximate pixel density of 133 pixels per inch and a screen to body ratio of 44.8%. Further it is also covered by a Corning Gorilla Glass covering which is known to be resistant to cracks, scratches etc. The Smartphone features a standard 5.0MP primary camera along with an inbuilt LED flash & panorama. It can capture images having 2592 x 1944 pixel resolution and can record video in 480p at 19 frames per second. However, it lacks a secondary VGA front camera which is essential for video calling & chatting features.. Nokia Asha 503 Dual SIM has a 4GB external SD memory card included in the base; it can be further expanded up to the highest limit of 32GB. One can also easily share stored pictures through various pre installed social networking applications such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter etc. You can also make effective use of the free cloud storage that comes with the model, called "One Drive" to upload pictures, videos etc.. Nokia Asha 503 Dual SIM offers its users with a virtually unlimited collection of songs (nearly 1.3 crores) through its inbuilt Radio app called – Nokia Mix Radio. The unique feature offered by Mix Radio is that the user is not charged for streaming songs on the radio playlist; also one can easily have access to songs on the radio even while in offline mode. Also its Dual SIM technology allows users to effectively switch between alternate SIM networks and receive calls on both networks simultaneously. Another great feature offered by the model is that the device can effectively remember SIM settings up to a limit of 5 SIMs.. Nokia Asha 503 Dual SIM works on a 1200mAh BL-4U Lithium ion battery and provides a music play time of 36 hours, stand by time of 480 hours on both 2G & 3G networks. Further it has an approximate talk time of 12 hours on 2G & 4 hours 30 minutes on 3G networks respectively. The model is available in a lot of vibrant colors including standard white, black, blue, red, green and yellow body colors in addition to a very cute display.. Reviews of Nokia Asha 503 Dual SIM.

I recently changed my mobile number, but whatsapp does not get linked to the new number.. 1) I re-installed whatsapp, and entered the new number; immediately I got a message "please re-install whatsapp again"; I kept doing this again & again but to no avail.. 2) I reset the mobile to factory settings and tried, still same issue.. 3) I used the both the SIMs and tried, but the issue was not resolved.. Let me give some more information.. I bought this mobile in India, and previously used an Indian SIM with which whatsapp was linked to. As I moved of India to Singapore and hadn't used my Indian number for a long time, it got disabled, re-released into the market, bought by someone else, and. that person installed whatsapp in his phone; suddenly I got a message to verify my whatsapp number when I realised my Indian number got disabled. I entered my Singapore number, and ever since have been trying steps 1-3 (mentioned above).. Also, when I re-install whatsapp, it always downloads the latest for one for Asha which is version 2.6.12. I also want to try with the original whatsapp version released for Nokia Asha 503; if it can be attached to this reply or a link is given to that,. I want to download and try that too.. I have the same question (10). As much as we would like to assist you in reinstalling WhatsApp, this is beyond our scope of support because it's a third-party app. You can always contact its developer.. You can always get back to us for any Windows Phone assistance.. 6 people were helped by this reply. Asha and Nokia Series 30/Series 40. Buy online, pick up in store.
