CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The iPhone 5C is available for $99 or less on contract, and in five bright colors. Compared with the 2012 iPhone 5, it’s got more widely compatible global LTE coverage, an upgraded front-facing camera, and slightly better battery life.. The Bad This phone is 2012 tech dressed up in a brighter package for 2013; the four-inch Retina Display feels small compared with most Android phones.. The Bottom Line The iPhone 5C is a great $99 phone that basically replicates the well-reviewed iPhone 5 in a more colorful case.. Editors' note (September 19, 2013): Call quality section with audio sample added. We will continue to update this review in the coming days, based on subsequent testing. Ratings should be considered tentative, and may evolve as testing continues. iPhone 5C (left) and iPhone 3GS (right): similar spirit. Editors' note (September 19, 2014): The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are now the flagship phones in Apple's 2014-2015 product line. However, in addition to the iPhone 5S , Apple is also still selling the iPhone 5C -- but only in a single 8GB capacity, down from its original 16GB and 32GB models. It's priced at $450 in the US ("free" with a 2-year contract), £319 in the UK, and AU$529 in Australia. If you can't find an older 16GB or higher model available for sale, the paltry 8GB capacity makes this 2014 update of the 5C tougher to recommend .. The iPhone 5C is kinda, sorta, technically a new product -- colorful, cute, with a variety of interchangeable color cases much like the recently released Motorola Moto X -- but under the hood it's really an iPhone 5 with a new paint job, and a cheaper price: $99 on contract (or even less, if you shop around).. To be clear, we loved the iPhone 5 when it first hit in 2012. It met every one of our needs, kept up with the competition, and presented a sweet spot of features: fast LTE wireless, a larger 4-inch screen, plenty of performance tweaks, a faster processor, and a really great camera. All of those features are back with the 5C.. The only new additions to the 5C (versus the old 5) are iOS 7 coming preinstalled, new LTE antennas that work with more international carriers, a better low-light-sensitive front-facing FaceTime HD camera, and a slightly increased internal battery versus last year's model -- better on paper, but not on a magnitude that most people would appreciate.. What the iPhone 5C isn't is a radical "budget" iPhone. It's not the affordable contract-free prepaid device some dreamed of. Instead, it's an iPhone 5 with a candy-colored polycarbonate shell. If you want something more advanced under the hood, the iPhone 5S is what you're looking for; if you want a bigger screen, nearly any Android phone will be a better choice.. Still, despite largely year-old tech inside, the iPhone 5C does a fine job for most people. Don't be surprised if it's a go-to choice for kids, for instance, who may value the color choices (and parents looking to get out of the store for less than $100.) It's the Basic White MacBook of iPhones. And, for everyday tasks, you'll have a hard time right now noticing the performance gap between it and the 5S with the naked eye. That's likely to change in a few months or a year, as Apple evolves iOS computing to areas where, perhaps, only the bleeding-edge 64-bit A7 chip in the iPhone 5S can reach. But for everyday people who aren't following every evolutionary step of the iPhone, the 5C covers most of the important bases. Just make sure you set your expectations to "last year's iPhone 5.". Configurations and carriers The iPhone 5C comes in 16GB and 32GB variations, for $99 and $199 on contract, respectively, or contract-free for $549 and $649. That's a hundred dollars less than an iPhone 5S at identical storage capacities across the board. In the US, the 5C is available on all four major carriers: AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, and T-Mobile. And T-Mobile's new "Uncarrier" model lets you buy the phone for zero (16GB) or $99 (32GB) down and spread the cost of the hardware over a two-year period, for $20 extra a month.. The 5C not only looks more like an iPod Touch, it even comes packaged in an iPod Touch-like jewel box with clear plastic. Inside you get the phone, a Lightning cable (with AC adapter), and pair of EarPod in-ear headphones with a built-in mic.. What do you give up over the 5S? This is the question everyone's going to ask: what am I missing out on between the iPhone 5C and 5S for that extra hundred dollars? For starters, the 5S has that crisp metal design. It also has a newer, faster A7 processor, a fingerprint-sensing Home button, an even better camera with faster autofocus, burst shooting, better low-light and antiblur features, and a Slow-Mo video recording mode that records at 120 frames per second at 720p. What's more, the 5S is capable of 64-bit computing, has better graphics, and has an M7 processor for enabling future built-in motion-tracking and health/fitness apps. And it's also available in a 64GB capacity, versus just 16GB or 32GB for the 5C.. A lot of those features are theoretical, or embedded so deeply the casual person wouldn't notice. The 5C and 5S have the same screen size and Retina resolution, and the same LTE antenna bands. Those are features most people will notice a lot more. The 5C, from an everyday boot-up, application-loading standpoint, feels similar to the 5S. That said, I wouldn't be surprised to see the phones' speed begin to diverge as the months and years progress -- once more advanced apps begin to appear that are optimized for the more sophisticated hardware of the 5S.. Design A brightly colored plastic iPhone: it sounds like something new, doesn't it? Not exactly: Apple's had brightly colored iPods for years, and the iPod Touch got its multicolored refresh in 2012. The iPhone 5C just feels like the extension of that bright-color philosophy into the iPhone line.. It doesn't feel like cheap plastic, though; the smooth, shiny polycarbonate shell around the back feels like a candy lacquer coating. It's a dense device, heavier than the iPhone 5 by nearly an ounce, but it has a comfortable feel -- maybe even better than the more hard-angled metal iPhone 5/5S. It's a return to the plastic iPhone, three years later.. The funny thing is, pull out an old iPhone 3G or 3GS and you'll see a remarkably similar finish. The 3GS looks bulbous and squat by comparison -- the 5C is flat-backed and longer, but it shares the wrap-around polycarbonate feel. This is not new so much as old and familiar.. The cosmetic differences between the 5C and the 5S feel like the old white MacBook versus the MacBook Pro line: plastic versus metal. Maybe this is meant to paint the iPhone 5S as a "pro" device. The 5C is comfortable, smooth and clean; the 5 and 5S have an angular, descended-from-a-spaceship industrial design.. The 5C is a hair longer (4.9 versus 4.87 inches), a hair wider (2.33 versus 2.31 inches), and a little thicker (0.35 versus 0.3 inches) than the iPhone 5 and 5S. What this really means is you can't put most iPhone 5 cases on it.. It's also heavier: 4.65 ounces, versus the iPhone 5S' 3.95 ounces. But it's still a little thinner and lighter than the iPhone 4S, if you're keeping score.. Just like the iPhone 5 and 5S, the headphone jack's on the bottom. Audio comes from a small four-holed grille on the bottom, and is as loud as that from the iPhone 5. The home button below the display remains exactly the same as previous iPhones: there's no fingerprint sensor here.. The iPhone 5C will be a far more appealing phone for kids: it seems less fragile, warmer, even simpler. It feels like an iPod: even the side volume rocker buttons are more elongated and iPod Touch-like. The colors are bright and oddly pastel, except for the white-backed 5C I ended up reviewing. All the iPhone 5Cs, incidentally, have black fronts. iOS 7 comes preinstalled with color-matched wallpaper and themes for each phone, which helps tie the whole color package together. The EarPods...well, those are still white.. Case and accessories A new design means new cases: Apple's selling its own, at $29 each, in a variety of bright colors, made of the same polyurethane/microfiber material as the iPad Smart Covers and Smart Cases. The bright cases are attractive; they're punched with large holes, so the iPhone's colors and the case colors play off each other for color combinations. You can only imagine third-party case manufacturers are going to be all over this type of idea.. Apple's own cases are comfy, but oddly designed: the open holes expose some of the stamped FCC and model information on the back of the iPhone. Peeking at bits of text ruins a bit of the ultra-clean effect. Why not shift those holes higher up, or place the text elsewhere? It's nitpicky, but Apple's design usually prides itself on these sorts of details.. Display and speakers The iPhone 5C's 4-inch, 1,136x640-pixel Retina Display seems every bit as bright and crisp as on the iPhone 5. But, it's also the same exact display: no extra pixel resolution, no added screen size. In a world of ever-larger smartphones, the iPhone 5C is more on its own now than it would have been in 2012. There's a lot of extra unused space above and below the screen.. That being said, Apple's iPhone 5 Retina Display remains one of the brightest and most color-accurate displays CNET's tested. It's an excellent display, and has very good 326 ppi pixel density. It could just be...well, a little bigger. There are 4.3- and 4.7-inch-display Android phones that don't feel honkingly large to hold, and perhaps show how Apple could have worked in a little extra screen.. A single speaker to the right of the Lightning port pumps out equivalently loud audio to the iPhone 5. Just like previous iPhones, it's possible to accidentally bottle up all noise by pressing a thumb to the speaker grille while playing a game or watching a movie.. Camera The same iSight rear-facing 8-megapixel camera that was in the iPhone 5 is in the 5C. iOS 7 adds a few more extras, such as digital zoom when recording video. Both 1080p video recording, photos and panoramic pictures all look great, but the iPhone 5S camera is even more refined, and adds slow-motion recording and multiburst.. A front-facing FaceTime HD camera has been slightly improved, adding better light sensitivity. Dimly lit selfies in my apartment hallway came out better on the 5C.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

The thing that made me buy an Apple iPhone 5c is that it is made by apple and was the latest product available on the market at that time. I bought it mainly because of its OS which was the new iOS 7 and when I used it it was worth the money. But its RAM is 1GB and its less for that amount of money, whenever I tried to pay a Batman game or some game with high storage it would force close the app.. Its processor is good and does multitasking fluently. And the camera is also good but I think its not so futuristic as iPhone 5s because apple is coming with new iPhones every year. Its battery is not so good it is still better than other iPhones except 5s. If its price was a little lower it would be worth the money. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.

It's absolutely worthless and fails to serve the purpose it was meant to serve...ie.to provide the apple experience in a low cost smartphone..the cheap plastic body with cheap colors impresses no one and it value for money absolutely zero as better,and more powerful android devices are available in morevariety and have more features than the 5c..sure it gives a good apple ios experience as the software is at par with that of the 5s but future software support is non-existent..speaking as an indian this phone is not a viable option as everything is very costly starting from the phone itself to its accessories and software..definitely not an option for students and youngsters.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 3.0 out of 5 stars Unlocked means not even a minimal SIM card. Size: 32 GB | Color: Blue | Verified Purchase. Got what I paid for, nothing more, nothing less. It was a little dinged up, but I got it as an app development machine, not a fashion accessory. I was never planning to use it as a phone. The most annoying part of the whole process was that it came with no SIM card, and you can't even connect it to iTunes without a SIM card. OK, so that's just a $1 item if you're not planning to use the phone funcitonality, but time is money, and I wasted a bunch of time buying one. Had I but known, I'd have been happy to pay $5 more to have it come with a minimal SIM card, and save the time of having to buy one.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars 32 GB Pink Iphone 5C MetroPCS, Great Product !. Size: 32 GB | Color: Pink | Verified Purchase. I took my time looking for a phone for the wife and settled on this one. I put a different case on it though. Apple iPhone 5c Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, Pink PROS: 1. It was for the wife so it was pink 2. Works great and the battery works great too. No real blemishes, phone looks good and works great. Came with wall charger and charge cable. Came with pink gel case too but I got a differnt on for it. Works fine with Metro PCS Cons: 1. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars I get all woogy when I see flip phones so talked her into an unlocked iPhone 5C so I could help her learn how to use a smart pho. Size: 16 GB | Color: Blue | Verified Purchase. Ordered this for a techno-phobic friend who was afraid to give up her 200 year old flip phone! I get all woogy when I see flip phones so talked her into an unlocked iPhone 5C so I could help her learn how to use a smart phone. Got a great one for $125, had it set up with ConsumerCellular (her choice due to low monthly cost ... she doesn't use ANY data), and now she's even texting! I put all her contacts in for her and now she's able to add new contacts herself. This phone is ideal for starting to learn to use a smart phone. I have ONLY had iPhones, so for me it's a no-brainer.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars Buy at own risk.. In my opinion if you really want the phone buy it, but the phone will not look nice. The iphone i received had some cracks on the screen and like every corner of the phone was chipping. I'm saying that's based on the previous owner dropping it multiple times. but i gave it a two because for the price you could just get something better condition somewhere else. Important: pay attention to which carriers you can use on this product.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Very Pleased with Item despite minor issues. Size: 16 GB | Color: Blue | Verified Purchase. Pros: Phone is brand new, unlocked and is in perfect condition. Shipping was extremely timely as well. Cons: Phone did not come in original box nor did it include the apple headphones which was mildly irritating. Also, annoying company sticker was on the back which was difficult to get off and left temporary residue. Overall I was very pleased with the purchase.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Good price, good size: now I understand Apple. Size: 16 GB | Color: Blue | Verified Purchase. When my son asked me for this smartphone, I wonder if the price will be the right. After a research, I found this model and in general terms very good comments. However, I found bad and nasty comment too. After 3 months since my purchase, I only have to say good things about this cellular phone. Good size, good appearance and competitive price. As my kid is a boy, I am glad with the light blue color, although at first sight, it has a weird color, but later it turns "part of the family". The size of the screen and icons is adequate and I am considering purchase the same brand in the incoming months.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Definitely used but reasonable priced. Size: 16 GB | Color: Blue | Verified Purchase. The phone is perfect my son loves it so far the only reason at this time I’m giving it 4 stars is because it was scratched pretty bad and as I opened it and the top left corner had a little green tent as if it was dropped or damaged but it’s working and great so far I’m happy Tmobile works great with this phone. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars snapped back together but the sound is not good at all. Size: 16 GB | Color: Blue | Verified Purchase. Opened the supposed 'New' box and no apple stickers. the phone was unlocked as promised but the charger and earbuds appear to be cheap knockoffs. the earbud came apart first time wearing. snapped back together but the sound is not good at all. The charger charges but if it is plugged in while using the phone, the phone has a problem. Not too happy to have someone sell a 'New' product which is obviously a refurbished at best and not refurbished by apple or the accessories would be genuine. Deciding whether to make a claim to amazon and send back or contest the credit card charge. the only reason I went this route is to get a 16gig 5C as the Apple store seems to only have 8gig for sale.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars.

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running..

Talk time (3G): 10.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

With the camera, the back camera when i try to take photos it freezes up and will only let me take photos with the front camera. i recently dropped it in water and the battery goes down quicker but other than that its fine. I just got the IPhone 5s and the camera works fine?! I dont understand........... hiflyr, 04 Feb 2018 I recently lost my Android phone, and needed a cheap replacement. more You should try looking up budget android phones and would be smiler price but larger screen e.g. Huawei p8 lite and Sony Experia L1.. I recently lost my Android phone, and needed a cheap replacement. No, it doesn't have a new quadcore, or octacore. Yes, it only has 1GB of ram. But, if you're like me, and all you really use your phone for is phone calls, texting, and occasional searches on the internet, you don't actually need much power. My only real complaint is the size. After you've gotten used to a 5+ inch screen, swapping to a 4 inch screen is somewhat annoying..

I have had a 5c for 5 years now and I am upgrading... anonymous, 19 Sep 2017 is there a fingerprint screen lock in it? You don't want to buy the 5c in Sept 2017. I have had a 5c for 5 years now and I am upgrading (buying a new iPhone) this week. No there is no fingerprint function and thus no Apple Pay. But far worse than that, the 5c is just too weak a performer to keep up with the latest IOS 10 (nor the 11 which will no longer fit on the 16GB version I have). I would advise to buy at least the iPhone SE or higher. I am opting for the SE just to save money and the specs are very close to the iPhone 6 which was my second choice. The iPhone 7 was next but just too expensive (so obviously the 8 and new X coming out is far beyond what I am willing to spend). is there a fingerprint screen lock in it?. szada, 01 Sep 2017 i need dawngrad ios10 to 9. so how to do it?

In order to try and provide customers with a mid-level option for one of the most popular smartphones in the world, Apple offers the iPhone 5c as a new mix on their line of phones. The iPhone 5 was Apple’s bestselling model to date and it has made a name for itself as the best selling iPhone in the world. The 5c aims to take what people already love, while adding plenty of new benefits. The highlights of the 5c are the vibrant color options, a larger battery, a better camera and even LTE coverage.. One of the staples that has always signified an iPhone is the standard black casing that has been on so many models in the past. However, the 5c aimed to differentiate from older models by adding five new colors to the mix. In order to add color to their devices, Apple added a plastic back to the device and then coated it with a glossy finish. This finish ensures that the iPhone 5c doesn’t feel or look like plastic, which other smartphone competitors often do. Instead, the general appeal of the new colors and the stability that it provides makes it so that users may feel as if they don’t even need a case to begin with. After all, it would be a shame to cover up the beautiful colors of the casing.. The colors that the 5c comes in are: pink, green, blue, white or red. Depending on what color phone you get, this will determine the wallpaper that is on your phone when you first turn it on. Unlike previous iPhone models that have the standard iPhone stars in the background, each of the 5c phones have a wallpaper that matches the color of the device cover. It’s a unique and creative feature that adds personality to the newest line of phones from Apple. It's a small feature, but it shows how much detail went into the planning of the latest model from Apple.. Because of the new color additions, the body of the iPhone 5c is a bit thicker than older models. However, that doesn’t make it overwhelming or hard to control. Instead, the added dimensions of the 5c make it more comfortable to grab and have hold of. That being said, users who have old iPhone 5 or even 5s cases, will be disappointed to know that their accessories won’t quite fit the same on the 5c. And if you upgrade from the 5c to the 5s, for example, any cases that you have may be a bit loose on the latter device.. For users that have an iPod, the color changes may look very similar. The changes to the iPod body were introduced by the same marketing strategy that Apple used with the iPhone 5c. This is a change from the old strategy of Apple, which typically revolved around selling less overall products. However, the new additions and the silicon cases that Apple sells will be greatly appreciated by those who want an iPhone with more options to display their style.. For those who are not looking for a silicon case, Apple also offers leather cases for the 5c as well. These look and feel much more sophisticated and elegant than the silicon cases, making them a perfect option for those looking for a less casual appearance.. As for the front of the iPhone 5c, it’s quite similar to what you’d see with the 5s and other previous models. You still get the standard iPhone home button placed at the bottom of the device, charging ports and volume buttons are the same, as is the placement of the sleep button.. iPhone users are notorious for taking photos and uploading them to social media sites. Online photo sharing app Flickr even lists the iPhone as the most popular device that uploads images to the site. This is why Apple has put such an emphasis on making the camera on their devices better with each release. The 5c is drastically better than the iPhone 4, including upgrades to the sensors in the system, lens improvements and better video and imagine processing. There is also the addition of movement stabilization and face detection as well.. The 5c also makes for great selfies, as Apple has upgraded their front-facing camera as well. The device offers sensor that helps detect light and uses photosensitive imagine elements, in order to give you the best conditions to take photos of yourself before uploading them or sharing with friends.. One of the most frustrating parts about any smartphone is the ability to head out for a day, use your phone regularly, and end up with dead battery after just a few hours of browsing. Luckily, this isn’t an issue with the 5c. Instead, the 5c provides one of the best batteries for a smartphone on the market.. The batter is a bit larger than other Apple devices. But with that weight, you get plenty of extra juice that will keep you going through the day. Other smartphones on the market typically have bigger batteries, but that just takes extra power to run the device. However, the iPhone 5c offers the perfect addition that is worth the added weight. During tests with the 5c, the battery offered just over eight hours of life. When comparing to other phones, only the 5s was able to top it. Other phones, such as the Galaxy Note 3, LG G2 and HTC One X, all came up much shorter and failed to even top eight hours.. Apple prides itself on being on the only 64-bit smartphone on the market. Therefore, the only competition that the company has to worry about is others that have a price comparison that is closer to the 5c. However, when you look at what the 5c offers for the price, it’s unbeatable by other phones on the market. Not only is the power better, but Apple also provides a variety of free apps and options for their users. Most noticeably, this includes Pages, Numbers, Keynote, iPhoto, iMovie and Garageband. These programs are staples for Apple and they used to charge money for each one. However, as Apple tries to get more users to rely on their devices and programs, the free additions are very welcome.. Not only will you get all of the free apps provided by Apple, but you’ll also get millions of downloadable options from the iTunes store.. Apple has made an effort to transition into the LTE market so that their phones can be used worldwide. As with the 5s, Apple included LTE technology on the 5c as well. Not only does this make it easier for people to use their phones abroad, but its also a market strategy for Apple to get more purchases in LTE markets that otherwise would rely on another device that offers the capabilities.. Along with LTE, Apple supports “wideband voice” to offer users a clearer call when contacting other uses. Apple also provides FaceTime, which is available on the 5c and other iPhone models. The 5c can also connect to other Apple devices, including Macs and iPads.. The fact that the 5c is less than the 5s is what Apple hopes will draw people in. It offers a less expensive option for those that still want to have an amazing device. Granted, those who still want to spend the extra money will likely be better with the iPhone 5s. However, that’s not to say that the 5c isn’t also a viable option for those on a budget.. The iPhone 5c is going to be a substantial upgrade over older iPhone models and most other smartphones on the market. The fact that it also offers a variety of new colors, that is added reason for people to get a device that is stylish and fits their personality.. If you are waiting for the next iPhone, but want to get something in the mean time, the 5c is a great option with a lower price tag. Outside of the 5s, this is the best smartphone on the market and it’ll leave you satisfied until your next upgrade.. Get $100 off iPhone 7 or 7 Plus. Get $100 off iPhone 8 or 8 Plus.

I love it the best phone I got I just wish the battery life was longer and that you can buy a charger from the gas station but the cameras good nice and clean and I love Imessenger and facetime best phone I ever had I want the 6s plus now but over all best phone ever just put on a case and screen covers glass does break easy..

Whatever, I am very disappointed that I cannot be on a call ando go onto the internet. I wish the Sales person had told me that. I would not have purchased this phone. I use that feature on the Android all the time.. Log In to rate this review or report it as inappropriate.. Mar 6, 2014 by jdadmays. I bought this phone when it first cam out and was skeptical about the 5s and whether the thumb scanner would hold up. I really didn't think I would need that. I absolutely love the style of the phone. Everyone was stating that the "C" was for cheap but there is nothing cheap about this phone. It feels great in the hand and very well made. Con is a bit slippery but who doesn't put a case on their phone and that solved that problem. Have to say the best phone for sound quality. I have a hearing problem and I have no problem with this phone. It is a great phone for one handed usage. Screen resolution is fantastic, Love watching videos on this phone. I think the multitasking is superb. The lightning cable is the best charging cable ever, all other phones with their micro usb is a hassle the lightning cable is great especially at night it doesn't matter which way it goes in and it charges the phone so fast. That is good because one of the complaints I have is the battery does not last to long always have to charge it at least once throughout the day or I will not make it all the way through but that is not so bad. The camera is amazing and when Apple decided to add panorama capability they just got it right I have taken some amazing photos in San Francisco and Chicago and my friends and family have asked what camera I was using because they thought it was a DSLR. They were very surprised when they found out that it was my iPhone 5c. I have to say that this is the best phone I have ever used. For personal and work it just does the job. Siri is the best voice assistant ever I do not know how I lived without it before now.. Log In to rate this review or report it as inappropriate.. Its the 5 shoved in a plastic case.. Dec 15, 2015 by Alvisowen12. I'm extremely happy with the 16 GB but the phone is 3 yrs old and runs extremely slow used to last me a whole work day but dies now towards the end of my 8 hour shift. If you don't mind a rubbery phone when out the case and the flashy bright colors go for it. Thinking about going to Android it's more freedom and less controlling if you have a young child this is definitely a good first phone.. Log In to rate this review or report it as inappropriate..

I got the Pink IPhone 5C and it works and looks brand new! It came in the mail on time and Its really good for a cheap price. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a cheap, basically brand new phone, and it has lottttts of storage (32 gb, which is my favorite part). Yes (60) No (11) Report. Average rating: 4 out of 5 stars, based on reviews. I bought this phone as a replacement for my son's phone. The price was right and to date we've had no issues with it. A few things to note, the package only contained the phone (not in a box) & a non Apple charging cord. There was no SIM card which wasn't an issue for us since I transferred his from his broken phone.. I got what I needed so I am happy with the purchase.. Yes (5) No (0) Report. 1-5 of 8 reviews.
