Community Join (Free Membership) Login About Us Informr Score Newsletter. The Motorola Moto G (2nd Gen) currently has an Informr score of 8.2 out of 10.. This score is based on our evaluation of 56. sources including reviews from users and the web's most trusted critics.. What's good Improved photo quality Good battery life Decent performance during everyday tasks Good overall screen sharpness. What's bad Internal storage limited to 8GB Processor cannot handle graphics-intensive games Tinny sounding speakers. The Moto G 2014 is Motorola's follow-up to their highly successful budget smartphone – the Moto G. Despite sharing the same name, the Moto G 2014 comes with some new upgrades, most noticeably a larger screen. The 5-inch display retains the same 720p resolution, which drops the pixel density to 294ppi. Although not up to par with retina displays, reviewers were satisfied with its overall sharpness though they add that they display doesn't have the best viewing angles and contrast. Still, Ars Technica notes, "The screen is great for the price…". Besides the larger screen, the Moto G 2014's design doesn't differ too much from its predecessor. It retains the same plastic chassis, interchangeable shells and slightly arched back cover. While slightly wider and taller, the Moto G 2014 offers the same 0.4 inch thickness as the original and is a tad heavier at 149 grams. The speakers, however, have moved from the back of the phone to the front. When reviewers compare the speakers to the previous version, they notice a jump in volume but describe the sound quality as "tinny." PC Advisors adds, "They're not great for music, but when playing games and watching videos…you'll appreciate both the stereo separation and decent quality.". The new Moto G sports a fairly basic spec sheet: a 1.2GHz quad-core processor, 1GB of RAM and a 2070 mAh battery. It isn't going to win any performance awards, but critics found it suitable enough for everyday tasks like browsing the web, playing casual games and checking emails. They do warn that it isn't capable of handling graphics or processor intensive games or apps. Due in part to the lower less powerful processor, reviewers note that the 2070 mAh battery can provide a solid one day's worth of juice during moderate usage. Internal storage is limited to 8GB though the phone does come with a microSD slot.. Besides the screen, the other big upgrade for the Moto G 2014 is the camera. Instead of a 5MP snapper, Motorola has increased the camera's resolution to 8MP. In comparison to the previous version, critics note huge improvements with color reproduction, low and indoor images and details.. Although Motorola doesn't really stray too far from the original formula, critics still recommend it as an excellent budget phone choice. Phone Arena states, "The handset screams value from every face." ZDNet adds, "As far as the new Moto G is concerned…we see no reason why it shouldn't continue the success of its predecessor.". You don’t have to search long to uncover the Moto G’s shortcomings, but if you meet them in the middle, it’s easier to embrace the phone for what it is. It’s not the market-changer like its 2014 predecessor, but that’s only because it’s upholding its predecessor&r.... Two years ago, the Moto G was the best budget handset around, offering a good screen size and a quad-core Snapdragon 410 chipset that were ahead of its time for the price. Six months ago, the Moto G (2014) kept the same internals, while increasing the screen size to still feel like a great budget op.... The same verdict applies to Motorola's Moto G 2nd Gen G4 as for the Moto G2 UMTS model. The significant modifications are LTE, the brighter but overall only marginally better screen (production deviation?), and the storage's considerably faster transfer rate that is barely reflected in the overall s.... The Moto G 4G 2015 edition it is a great device, at a decent price, with a great display, a Micro SD and some front facing speakers and a pretty decent rear camera. Yes it would be an amazing device with just a little bit more internal memory, but that would cost more. If you're looking for a cheap 4G smartphone then the Moto E 4G is the best deal on the market right now.

You don’t have to search long to uncover the Moto G’s shortcomings, but if you meet them in the middle, it’s easier to embrace the phone for what it is. It’s not the market-changer like its 2014 predecessor, but that’s only because it’s upholding its predecessor’s tradition.. The Moto G is a smartphone for consumers who find value in simplicity rather than bells and whistles. Its lack of bloatware, its comfortable design, and its outstanding battery life add up to a phone that's here to please the crowd rather than dazzle the competition....

Its lack of bloatware, its comfortable design, and its outstanding battery life add up to a phone that's here to please the crowd rather than dazzle the competition. Make no mistake: This is not the type of bargain that will leave you feeling high in dry in a few months' time. Motorola has produced a practical device that cuts corners in a very measured way.. If you're hoping to do more than basic point-and-shoot photography, you might want to explore other options—the absence of a decent camera is sure to have shutterbugs shying away from it. If solid performance and the price to match is what's important to you, you could certainly do much worse than the Moto G.. Slight improvement to a proven formula. Two years ago, the Moto G was the best budget handset around, offering a good screen size and a quad-core Snapdragon 410 chipset that were ahead of its time for the price. Six months ago, the Moto G (2014) kept the same internals, while increasing the screen size to still feel like a great budget option. With this latest variant, the glacially-changing Moto G line is finally starting to show its age, particularly in light of growing competition from Chinese manufacturers like Huawei and Xiaomi....

The Moto G 4G (2015) remains a good budget phone, but we hope that the next Moto G - which we're expecting to see later in the year - takes a big step forward in terms of hardware so it can keep up with its rivals.. Bright, very color accurate screen but middling performance. The same verdict applies to Motorola's Moto G 2nd Gen G4 as for the Moto G2 UMTS model. The significant modifications are LTE, the brighter but overall only marginally better screen (production deviation?), and the storage's considerably faster transfer rate that is barely reflected in the overall scores of the other benchmarks. Unexpectedly, and in the opinion of the tester, the significantly classier Lollipop now in Material Design and its many improvements over KitKat, does not give the new model a speed advantage despite identical core components. Although that is disappointing, the new model only costs approximately 20 Euros (~$22) more than the Moto G2.....

Anyone who finds the second generation Moto G appealing and can live without a dual-SIM but not without high-speed LTE data transmission does not have to think twice and can grab it.. Seriously impressive in its own right. The Moto G 4G 2015 edition it is a great device, at a decent price, with a great display, a Micro SD and some front facing speakers and a pretty decent rear camera. Yes it would be an amazing device with just a little bit more internal memory, but that would cost more.

The spec difference between this and the new Moto E is confusing as the Moto E seems to have a better processor. But I feel that this model is seriously impressive in its own right and that’s probably just down to Lollipop and decent 4G.. Poor successor to the best budget phone on the market and no match for the cheaper Moto E. If you're looking for a cheap 4G smartphone then the Moto E 4G is the best deal on the market right now.

Motorola truly impressed us with the original Moto G, a budget smartphone that, at launch, was untouchable. But its larger-scale and slightly more expensive follow-up was a little less impressive due to a bulkier design and lack of 4G. Which is where, in part, the Moto G 2015 comes in to rectify things. Although it's still large and isn't the cheapest route to buying a 4G handset, it's an altogether affordable offering that delivers on its speedy connectivity promise. Add the latest Android Lollipop operating system, a few added software bonuses from Motorola, solid battery life and it's a solid all-round performer..

The Moto G definitely feels more expensive than it is though — and not only physically, but from both a performance and OS usability standpoint too. Despite the lower-end hardware, it’s generally fast unlock the phone, fire up the camera or launch apps and games, with only a little bit of lag here and there (most notably when returning back to the Home screen, where the icons can often take half a second the reappear)....

Despite the lower-end hardware, it’s generally fast unlock the phone, fire up the camera or launch apps and games, with only a little bit of lag here and there (most notably when returning back to the Home screen, where the icons can often take half a second the reappear). It isn’t perfect, then, and Motorola’s also deliberately held some software features back (like the ability to customise the quick settings buttons in the notifications area, or Active Display which shows notifications on the screen) for its higher-end Moto X. In short, though it may be priced like a featherweight, the new Moto G’s got a punch that can take down opponents at twice its price. An inexpensive smartphone and a real competitor for mainstream smartphones. Motorola continues its strategy with the Moto G2 and once again builds a simple smartphone with original Android and replaceable covers. The Moto G2 is not a device that is going to be very exciting, it is more of a loyal companion that hardly disappoints you. It is nice that Motorola really improved the second generation of the Moto G: The front facing speakers are still not excellent, but at least decent. The cameras are significantly better too, but there is still room for improvement, for example the video resolution. The Moto G2 supports two SIM cards ex-works, which is a nice feature. The system performance is not outstanding since Motorola still uses the SoC from the predecessor, but the gaming performance is still decent....

The system performance is not outstanding since Motorola still uses the SoC from the predecessor, but the gaming performance is still decent. Real points of criticism are the missing power adaptor, the pressure-sensitive chassis, and the slow GPS module. You might also wonder about the firm replaceable back cover, and why the battery capacity is not larger than before. Overall, the second generation of the Motorola Moto G is a very successful update, which is nothing special in terms of design, but it will be a reliable companion. The Motorola Moto G2 is a good choice if you prefer a simple and functional smartphone.. It has everything you want at a decent price.Motorola still has some stuff..

Motorola Moto G (2nd Gen.) android smartphone. Motorola Moto G (2nd Gen.) android smartphone. Making flagships redundant for the low price of $269. 286 Users want this. 4.00 / 5. No support for larger microSDXC storage cards. Same 5-inch display as last model. More expensive than similarly specced rivals. Here lies to the follow up to Motorola’s most successful smartphone ever, the second generation Moto G. Time has seen the smartphone grow half an inch in screen size, gain higher resolution cameras and house stereo speakers. Do these changes make a good thing better, or is the smartphone Good Gear Guide unashamedly adored no more?. The original Moto G did to the smartphone what the Nexus 7 did for tablets: it made great technology affordable. Features including its quad-core CPU, retina-grade screen and quality 5 megapixel camera were scarce when it launched for $249. These were flagship features offered for a fraction of the price. It’s no wonder the smartphone broke Motorola records across the globe.. The Moto G inherits a lot from its predecessor — thankfully. The smartphone wears an unassuming shade of black up front, has tapering edges on the sides sides and a curving spine round back.. Growing in height to 142mm has taxed how comfortable the Moto G is in the palm, but compared to other large smartphones, such as the 5.2in Samsung Galaxy S5 , it proves more comfortable still.. That was the beauty behind the original Moto G and Motorola has managed to create the same magic again. Flanking the screen are two noticeable accents that assume the roles of speaker grilles. Choosing to feature front-firing stereo speakers has caused Motorola to disfigure the previously uninterrupted smartphone face.. Completing the multimedia repertoire is a screen that is half-an-inch larger at 5-inches. It still comes with the same 1280x720 resolution as its predecessor and, as a result, the Moto G packs a lesser 294 pixels-per-inch. The drop in pixel density hurts little other than bragging rights.. The older Moto G boasted 429 nits of brightness. Bigger and brighter screens demand more from the battery. Considering the Moto G retains the same sized battery, it appears the new Moto G has had to take a cut in luminance to 390 nits. That small difference is enough to take pop from colours; to turn a great display into a mediocre one.. The larger screen is not a pro nor a con for the Moto G. Bigger screens alone don’t improve quality any more than more megapixels improve a camera. The original Moto G had a respectable 4.5in size. Those unphased by half-an-inch extra should seriously consider the older smartphone.. Few other changes have been made to the Moto G. Inside it is still powered by a 1.2GHz quad-core CPU, has 1GB of RAM, an HSPA modem, 8GB of internal storage and the option to expand memory by a further 32GB with a microSD memory card.. The Moto G now supports dual-band Wi-FI (802.11ac) and maintains support for Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS. The strains of its price tag become visible with no support NFC or 4G data speeds.. The Moto G is all the better for keeping the OS stock and not desecrating it with a half-baked overlay. Differentiating this budget smartphone from its competition is its ability to take two SIM cards. Most dual-SIM smartphones resign one SIM slot to 2G voice calls only, but the Moto G goes one further by having both slots support HSPA data speeds. It is possible to designate one SIM for data, and designating a default SIM for individual contacts is easy. For instance, sending a text to GGG editor Elias can be set to always send messages from SIM 1.. Read more Motorola unveils new $269 Moto G and Moto X range of smartphones. Accessing the SIM trays and card slot is done by peeling off the back cover. Despite being able to remove the back cover, the smartphone’s 2070 milliamp-hour battery cannot be accessed and therefore cannot be replaced.. Good Gear Guide used the Motorola Moto G as our primary smartphone during our testing period. We loaded it with two SIM cards, used it for calls, texts and Internet browsing, managed our social network account, streamed YouTube and made little use of GPS. During this real-world test, we had brightness set to auto and the battery saver mode off.. The Moto G lasted 21 hours before needing a charge. Enabling the battery saver mode, which disables cellular data when the battery runs low, would have prolonged battery life.. The Moto G runs a version of Android so bare boned that the company has been at the forefront when it comes to software support. But a few apps set the software on Motorola phones from that running on a Nexus device, and the Moto G is no different.. Read more Apple iPhone 6 hands-on. The Moto G’s camera then, like every other part of the smartphone, punches well above its weight. Motorola Alert predefines who should be notified in emergency situations. Tapping one button triggers an automated text to be sent to your emergency contact headlined “I’m in danger”, along with your address and GPS coordinates. An emergency alarm is set off by the smartphone at the same time. Additional modes include “meet me” and “follow me”.. Motorola Assist demonstrates the same intuition by identifying when you’re at work, in a meeting, driving or at home, and then by automatically enabling the relevant profile. The Moto G will automatically silence itself in meetings and respond to missed calls with a text; when driving or at home, the smartphone will read out text messages and narrate who is calling; and, when you’re asleep, it will silence notifications until morning.. Vanilla Android is comprehensive and replete with features. The Moto G is all the better for keeping the operating system stock and not desecrating it with a half-baked overlay. This way Motorola can ensure the software is reliable, quick and uniform in design.. Read more Motorola Moto X and 360: On sale in Australia, October. Better front and rear cameras complete the list of improvements Motorola has made to the Moto G. Both cameras have jumped up in resolution — the front from 1.2MP to 2MP, and the rear from 5MP to 8MP — and both are capable of recording videos in 720p resolution.. Photos captured with the rear camera sit amongst the best within the Moto G’s price range. A wide range of colours are rendered with vibrancy and photos are sharp. Signs of image noise are apparent in dim lighting, but these photos will still look great on a 720p screen.. Motorola’s camera interface remains a joy to use. The clever UI is based on gestures: swiping right generates a settings menu, left opens the gallery and pressing down the screen triggers burst mode. The Moto G’s camera then, like every other part of the smartphone, punches well above its weight.. Read more Motorola Moto X (2nd Gen): Hands on with Motorola's bold flagship. Now more than ever can anyone drop their $900 flagship smartphone, pick up the $269 Moto G and have all of their needs met. That was the beauty behind the original Moto G and Motorola has managed to create the same magic again.. Slowly Motorola is setting up its budget smartphone as a powerful tool for multimedia. The bigger screen will appeal to a great many, while stereo speakers complement it during video and music playback. Throw in proficient cameras and the result is a smartphone ripe for content consumption.. The Moto G, with its dual-SIM set-up and 3G modem, was not developed for wealthy Australia, where we can afford to invest in fast network infrastructure and the cost of data. People wanting for a real flagship smartphone without holding out on 4G should consider the Moto G 4G — a variant of the first generation Moto G that comes with expandable memory and a 4G modem.. Whether you invest in the first or second generation Moto G, the end result remains the same: you’re winning.. Rocket to Success - Your 10 Tips for Smarter ERP System Selection.

I would recommend this device for families and small businesses who want one safe place to store all their important digital content and a way to easily share it with friends, family, business partners, or customers.. It’s easy to set up, it’s compact and quiet when printing and to top if off, the print quality is excellent. This is hands down the best printer I’ve used for printing labels.. Brainstorming, innovation, problem solving, and negotiation have all become much more productive and valuable if people can easily collaborate in real time with minimal friction.. The print quality also does not disappoint, it’s clear, bold, doesn’t smudge and the text is perfectly sized.. The Huddle Board’s built in program; Sharp Touch Viewing software allows us to easily manipulate and edit our documents (jpegs and PDFs) all at the same time on the dashboard..

Tengo este celular desde el 2014 a finales del año, va cumplir ya 4 años, nunca tuve ningun incoveniente, solo el poblema de la memoria, se llena rapido, mas con los grupos wpp, que mandan imagenes pero, hace unos meses empezo a fallar algunas partes del teclado, pero nada grave, hasta ahorita que algunas veces no me agarra el touch, y cuando quiere agarra, y asi, la verdad, nose si tenga arreglo o mejor compro algunas de sus nuevas generaciones del moto. Una inquietud no celular ya voy para dos años y medio de tenerlo y muy contenta pero últimamente se me recalienta y se apaga ..puedo sabes dónde lleva la batería tengo que cambiarla ? No sé q hacer mil Gracias bendiciones. arruiné el centro de carga y francamente no quiero que alguien se lo cambie porque no quedan bien los celulares después de eso.. Donde puedo conseguir un cargador inalámbrico?. Que onda tengo este equipo desde hace tres años es muy buen celular, jalaba juegos y aplicaciones al 100, el problema es k desde k lo actualize al android 6.0 ya no corrió juegos como dead space y shadowgun, no se por k si anteriormente los corría perfectamente, alguien me puede decir por que? O si se puede regresar al Android k tenía de fabrica, era el 4.4.4 kit kat, no lo kiero cambiar se me hace un buen celular. Necesito saber si le puedo poner un chip de otra compañía a mi celular moto g 2. Hola a todos, quisiera saber cuanto tiempo aproximadamente le dura la batería a este terminal ya que estoy a punto de tener uno. esperó respuesta y saludos a todos. Los 8 GB se llenan por arte de magia. Ni siquiera le he bajado juegos.

Hi Sir due to installing wrong rom in my moto g2 xt1068 my phone got hard bricked. now when i connect my phone with usb cable there are new drivers it is picking up as nokia,samsung and always say that my device is a unknown device can you help me ???. September 18, 2016 at 4:32 pm. First let me say that you are awesome. .Your videos taught me how to root and walked me through rooting my first 2 devices.You and a few other devs are why I call myself today: An aspiring Android developer and a recovering Windows expert.. i have a Moto e 2nd gen xt1526 that was found. I did locate the owner, he has no interest in recovering it so I am trying to bypass FRP (as the original owner I can no longer locate). I did a factory reset based on a youtube video that showed some clever exploits to get to settings. I did this 2 days ago on an LG (slightly different method) and it worked great.. I can reach settings and build no, but pressing it many times doesn’t turn on developer options. I’m assuming this may be due to no actual account being on the phone any longer. l have the Moto drivers installed. This Win 8 laptop recognizes it as an mtp I think, though I can browse the file systems on internal and XD, of course it’s not rooted and I have no access to root.. I also have android studio and jdk installed on the laptop. Is there any way around this?. September 18, 2016 at 9:02 pm. watch and follow my turbo 2 FRP Videos that will do the trick for you. March 8, 2017 at 5:47 pm. Okay, so this does not help me at all. First, I can’t even figure out what phone I have. I looked up the code and it said Motorola Moto E, except I can’t take the back off. So anyway, I got into the fastboot mode menu, and I followed the directions as best as I could. I scrolled to the “recovery mode” and held the power button down. At first it didn’t do anything, then it flashed “no command” with the little robot thing opened up. After a minute or two, it turned on to the opening screen thing (I’m sorry if I’m not very specific, I’m not good at technology). It started looping again, except it can’t be turned off now. I can’t afford a new phone. I will try to provide anything else you need, but you’ll have to ask. I hope to get a response soon. Leave a Comment Cancel reply.

Motorola Moto G (2nd gen): First impressions By Raymond Wong on 09/04/2014 23:01 PST. Design Specifications Product Name Moto G (2013) Moto G (2nd gen) (2014) Weight 143 g 149 g Street Price $179.99 (8GB) $179.99 (8GB) Resolution 1280 x 720 1280 x 720 Size (Diagonal, Inches) 4.5″ 5″ Processor Name 1.2GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 1.2GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 RAM 1GB 1GB Operating System (OS) Android 4.3 Android 4.4.4 Memory Card Type None Yes Built-In Storage 8,16 GB 8,16 GB Rear Camera 5 MP 8 MP Front Camera 1.3 MP 2 MP Battery Capacity (mAh) 2070 mAh 2070 mAh Size / Display Camera Front-facing Speakers Dual SIM + DTV (Select models) Storage Expansion More Moto Shells Pricing and Availability. The Moto G is the Moto X’s little brother. It’s a good-enough smartphone that’s cheaper than the Moto X , just like a kid brother who’s aspiring to be like his older brother. Along with the All New Moto X (2nd gen) , Motorola also announced another a new little brother, the Moto G (2nd gen).. It’s no secret the Moto G has been a huge hit, especially in developing countries; it is the company’s best-selling smartphone to date. The combination of dirt-cheap $180 no-contract pricing (for the 8GB model) and decent performance (and later the addition of an LTE model) has pulled Motorola back from the brink of irrelevance in the Apple and Samsung dominated mobile war.. As with the Moto X (2nd gen), I also got to play with the Moto G (2nd gen). To cut to the chase: I think Motorola has another budget hit again.. As with the leap from the Moto X to the Moto X (2nd gen), the changes between the Moto G and Moto G (2nd gen) are subtle. The Moto G (2nd gen) still takes very much after the Moto G, but it’s still not quite as svelte as the Moto X.. On the front of the smartphone is a front-facing speaker (on the bottoM), a 2-megapixel front-facing camera.. The back is a matte polycarbonate plastic that resembles last year’s Moto X more closely.. The internal hardware itself didn’t change at all. It has the same entry-level 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor, Adreno 305 450MHz GPU, and 1GB of RAM, which is enough to run Android 4.4.4 fluidly, but only because it’s pure Android. Motorola says it will be one of the first devices “guaranteed” to updated to Android L when that arrives. It will be interesting to see how last year’s processing power handles Android L.. 5-inch smartphones are the new 4-inch smartphones. That is, most people consider a 5-inch display to be the entry-level baseline (unless you’re Apple, of course). The Moto G (2nd gen)’s display now sits at 5-inches, up from the 4.5-inch display on the Moto G.. The larger display doesn’t mean a higher resolution, though. The Moto G (2nd gen) retains the same 1280 x 720 resolution as its predecessor, which is a bummer because while the new screen is sharp, the 5-inch size is a natural fit for Full HD 1920 x 1080 resolution.. In regards to the size of the Moto G (2nd gen)…well it’s not uncomfortable. It’s just barely usable with a single hand (I have small hands). As I noted in my Moto X (2nd gen) first-impressions, the 4.7-inch Moto X (2013) and the 5-inch LG G2 (2013) are really the perfect size in terms of large-enough display/one-handed usage compromise.. The Moto G (2nd gen) has a new 8-megapixel camera and slightly better 2-megapixel front camera. I didn’t have a Moto G on hand to compare the image quality, so I can’t judge yet. I’d say the image quality is okay, but not great. I can see some more detail when zooming in on photos, but the shutter is still slow (the lens/aperture animation doesn’t help at all). I need to test it in more detail before I can determine if the camera is really a dud or not. But my first impression is that the camera is only marginally better.. Sound is another thing Motorola says original Moto G owners wanted improved. The Moto G (2nd gen), like the new Moto X (2nd gen) has a front-facing speaker. I admit, sound is clearer and less tinny on the Moto G, but only because the audio is now projected towards you and not away from you.. But there is one difference: the Moto G (2nd gen) has stereo speakers, whereas the Moto X (2nd gen) only has a single-front-facing speaker.. This is a personal preference, but I’m not a fan of the two metallic rod-like speaker grills. Something more akin to the micro-drilled holes on the HTC One (M7) and HTC One (M8) is more attractive.. Smartphones equipped with dual SIM card slots are rare in the Western world, but go to China and Latin America and it’s a common sight. For whatever reason, some people want to manage two phone numbers on one smartphone. The Moto G (2nd gen) lets you do that, kinda.. By that, I mean there will be three models of the Moto G coming out. In the U.S., the only model is the single SIM one. In other regions, a dual SIM model will be available. And if you’re in Brazil, a 16GB model with dual SIM card slots and DTV (digital TV tuner) will be available.. One of the reasons why the Moto G is so affordable is because it starts at $180 for an 8GB model. That may have been a lot of storage in 2008, but it’s insufficient today. The addition of a microSD card slot to the Moto G (2nd gen) is very welcome for those who want to start small, but add more storage later for cheap (seriously, microSD cards are ridiculously cheap nowadays).. But don’t run out and buy a 128GB microSD card. The Moto G (2nd gen) only supports up to 32GB microSD cards.. The Moto G doesn’t have Moto Maker, but it does have swappable rear covers. The Moto G (2nd gen) has the same removable rear covers aka Moto Shells. Black-colored devices come with black covers and white with white covers.. A Flip Shell with a built-in magnetic cover that protects the screen will also be available in numerous colors.. Motorola is selling the Moto G (2nd gen) as an unlocked and no-contract device today in the U.S. on Motorola.com for $179.99 (same price as the 1st gen Moto G). The Moto G (2nd gen) is also available in the UK, Brazil, Germany, and Spain on their own respective Motorola websites.. Read more about Android 4.4.4 , Moto G (2014) and Motorola ..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars good camera and a quad core and this ticked all .... Got this to replace an aging Galaxy Ace, Wanted a Phone with 4G, large screen, enough storage for games and social media, good camera and a quad core and this ticked all the boxes. Screen is bright, colorful has good sensitivity and using the internet is a pleasurable experience now. Was easy to set up, just put your Sim in and migrate your contacts and your away. (my old SD card went in also without any issues) Has a notification to upgrade to Lollipop 5.02 which is painless and took about 7 mins over wifi. Still working through the many features of the phone, very happy with purchase. Only thing I didn't like was that there is no way to change the battery so if that dies then the phone is useless, hope it last a few years although the day to day longevity of the battery is excellent.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Phone! Ergonomic. Excellent Phone! Ergonomic! Tough! As a person working in the construction industry, I have to be weary of the phones I use. Dust and Dirt have been a bane of my prior phones and have hindered the speaker and microphone. This has NOT been the case with this as the large speakers make things loud and clear to hear over most background noise and the normal earpiece is just as reliable. It's a plastic body which is tough in its design as getting caught in pockets. bashed or bumped in pockets or sat on in a back pocket has not phased this phone at all. No dents or scratches to be seen. In terms of dust or dirt, the speakers are easy to clean with a fine/soft bristle brush which keeps them as good as new thanks to their design. The only drawback is the 1Gb of ram which makes for slow response times with multiple apps open, heavy users beware. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars excellent for the price. Ordered this phone as my HTC One Mini2 got wet and failed and I needed something relatively cheap to keep me going during the contract as I didn't have insurance. I found this phone on a review site for "best value 4G smartphones" and I can see why this one featured. At £135 it is at least 40% cheaper than most other phones and I'm impressed with the quality for the money. It doesn't have the refinement of the HTC, Samsung or Sony because you don't get the customised android skin, but its easy to use and looks perfectly good. My only negative comment is that for a 4G handset of this size it seems a bit under powered. Hopefully motorola will upgrade the processor and RAM in the next model as it is noticeably slower than the HTC One. Also be careful which model you order because there have been 3 versions - the first gen which is only 3G, the 2nd gen which was a revamp on the casing but is still only 3G, and then the 2nd gen 4G. Oddly - the 2nd gen 3G and 2nd gen 4G are both the same price!. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars Crippled by poor internal memory. It's good enough for a budget smart phone, and the camera is really nice with very faithful colours and contrast. However, the meagre and scanty allocation of internal memory really undermines what could be a very decent phone. While, yes, it is possible to send some apps over onto the sd-card, you only have something like 1.3 Gb (optimistically) for those which can't be moved. I'm not a particularly intensive app user but I find this nothing like enough. Added to which, it can be quite laggy and the screen sensitivity/accuracy is rather poor. It's a shame, it wouldn't take a lot to make this a solid little phone, as it is, it leaves me questioning the value of budget smart phones over a similarly priced stupid phone with a camera and music player.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great Phone: Great Value. This was a big step-up from my aging Samsung S2. The migration was very easy with the built-in app and one that had to be leaded onto my old phone - they just chatted together for awhile. Then my old apps, photos, contacts etc. Needless to say some aspects of the old phone are more appealing (Samsung versions) but the new Google built-in apps work very well. There is only a small amount of Motorola added apps and consequently much more user memory available. I did add a 8GB microSD card and have moved as many apps that allow being transferred to it. With photos and files on the microSD card I still have over 2GB left on internal storage. After the initial days of playing and setting up the phone and downloading extra apps, I am able to make good use of the phone for e-mail access and occasional web browsing, but only usually charging it every other day -- and at a push could manage three days.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Great Phone But Needs 16GB Internal Storage. I like everything about this phone apart from one thing. The total usable memory you get is 4.85GB and you need to leave at least 500MB for it to function optimally. On the phone I have about 3GB of apps (these are just regular sized apps no big games or anything), only 300mb of music and 200mb of pictures. I'm therefore not sure where the rest of my storage is going because often when I update big apps my phone says I'm out of space and I'm constantly needing to clear the cached data. I personally think in this day and age phones should have a minimum of 16GB and if you want to charge a little more thats fine. Sure there's the SD option but I find that a hassle moving apps onto there to free up space, SD cards becoming faulty and needing formatting etc. It could also be a little faster but it's fine really.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars German Model. First things first: the phone itself is generally excellent. Can be a bit slow at times, but not generally too bad, and with a good screen, good connectivity options, latest version of Android, and superb value for money. However, the one I received was clearly for the German market; the system messages are in German, the instructions were in German and the system version is a German one. Obviously the language can be set to English for everyday usage, but system messages and version cannot be changed, and this will affect future updates as well. Perhaps I've been unlucky, but nowhere in the description does it mention this, which is highly misleading, hence 1 star.. Was this review helpful to you?.
