High screen-to-body ratio (75.03 %). Extremely high pixel density screen (520 ppi). The Motorola Moto X Style isn't exactly small, but it isn't humongous either. As a matter of fact, it boasts one of the highest screen-to-size ratios in the industry – 76% of its front is occupied by the 5.7-inch screen packing a 1440 by 2560 pixels of resolution. Inside ticks a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 SoC with a 1.8GHz maximum clock speed. Yup, turns out that the rumors of the phone packing an SD 810 were incorrect. But while not the fastest SoC in Qualcomm's stable, the Snapdragon 808 is still powerful enough to deliver a smooth experience, especially when it is accompanied by 3GB of RAM.Turn the Moto X Style around and you'll find a 21MP camera with F2.0, phase-detection autofocus, and dual-tone LED flash.On the front of the Moto X Style we see a 5MP front-facing camera backed up by... Motorola Moto X Pure Review Motorola Moto X Style manual. Dimensions: 6.06 x 3.00 x 0.44 inches (153.9 x 76.2 x 11.06 mm). Weight: 6.31 oz (179 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). IP certified - The IP code indicates the degree of protection against dust and water. The first number represents dust protection, while the second represents water protection. In IP67, for example, 6 means a completely dust-tight device, while 7 means the device can stay immersed in up to 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes.

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Hexa-core, 1800 MHz, ARM Cortex-A57 and ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Yes No. worst customer service ever, on the verge of taking legal action against motorola. By Abhilash Ramachandran | 9 Mar 2016. undefinedMotoX style is an awesome phone, I really loved it. Other than Battery life remaining all i was very much satisfied till my phones screen got shattered after it's small fall from my bed. I wanted to get it repaired it as fast as i can, i brought it to the Moto care service center in jayanagar Bangalore, which is the biggest in India(As Motorola says).. I give it there in the month of January and still i am waiting for a call from them. whenever i contact them only thing they have to say is the parts are not available in the market.Seriously?? For three months? This is march and give it on January, They are already charging huge amount for the screen replacement(10K) which i am not bothered, my only concern was to get my phone back as soon as possible.I have contacted motorola's Hotline for customer care and filed a complaint also regarding this.. They always make some or the other reason to make it extended, there were weird reasons like due to chennai floods their warehouse got damaged as well as all the parts which were stored there. If i am not wrong when chennai flood happened this Moto X Style was not even released. And most of the time they won't pick your phone if we call from our registered phone number, and whenever the call is connected they will tell with in this time moto will get back to you, believe me it is not going to happen, they never call back. Only once they call back when I threatened them that i will take legal actions against your company and their service.. Anyways i am seriously fed up Moto care and their service. it was just 1 month old phone, when it got damaged it is really heart breaking more over when it takes such a long time even to get it repaired as a customer anyone will lose hope in the brand. Seriously motorola you people are having a pathetic customer service, for all of them who are interested to buy this phone have a second thought, if it got any damage for your phone, moto care need minimum 3 month’s time to make it done. I am thinking of taking legal action against the company and their service centers as I don’t have any other options to go for. I pre ordered this phone from flipkart and I got it very next day of release in my hand. I had a trust on MOTOROLA , which is completely spoiled now. I will not take any other product from MOTOROLA here after, their products are good but customer satisfaction is also a very important stuff and in that you people are pathetic, I am sorry for using that word but it is the fact. So you people are forcing me to go for legal actions as I don’t have any other options and I need my phone back very soon.. Thank you for responding at least here, yesterday was the last date your moto care (B2X MOTO FLAGSHIP BANGALORE) have said to me. I was trying their number for full day, nobody responded. here is the details of the complaint i lodged in your motorola cust. Was this review helpful?

Yes, 21 MP with autofocus Features:. Face detection, Geo tagging, Panorama, Touch to focus Video Recording:. Very nice review to make it way helpful!. How does the field of view change in the different video modes vs. Your review is great, Lars! Thanks a lot!. Also do you think it makes more sense for the average user to leave the Moto camera setting to the default 16MP Widescreen or change it to the 21MP, as far as overall picture quality goes?. this is entirely up to you if you prefer the 16:9 or the 4:3 format. Personally, I don't like 16:9 too much because it is not a traditional photo but a video format. Also, it usually just doesn't work in portrait orientation and if you shoot 4:3 you can always crop the image to 16:9 if you feel like it but not the other way around :). I don't know if my question is naive or not, but do you think using the google camera app, or other 3rd party apps, instead of the Moto stock camera app would have a negative effect on the quality of the pictures? This is a general question regarding other OEM camera apps as well. Do you recommend sticking to the default OEM camera apps as far as picture quality goes, or you think people should feel free to use other Camera apps available in app store?. in the vast majority of cases using another camera app won't have an impact on image quality as all apps use the same camera API. Using a third-party app is mainly about user interface and features.. Good to see that more and more manufacturers put decent effort in their camera units.. LG G4 is still ahead of the pack on camera features. Lazer AF and raw images are just awesome.. Too much pixels and no OIS make low-light and indoor shots muddy. You got what you paid for for $400-500. If you want to take indoor scenery, I guess. Most people want pics of people indoors and in that case OIS is actually a handicap. The camera will often choose ridiculous shutter speeds like 1/4, think it can rely on OIS. But OIS can't keep your subject still. I wonder why (for all these phones) maximum storage card sizes are always given as 64GB or 128GB when there's a 200GB microsdxc card out there. The 200GB card usually does work, but it's never in the official specs.. The limit is 2TB actually, if you can get that card.. Doesn't any company get the message for an affordable small camera unit without phone? I would like to buy such a device with good photo qualifications and not games, phone, etc.. there are probably thousands of affordable compact cameras out there...what's wrong with those?. Good to see that more and more manufacturers put decent effort in their camera units. But looking at higher ISO photos I'd say OIS is missing badly. Maybe the sensor is too large? On the good, by now "old" Nexus 5 it worked really well and should be in every good camera phone 2 years on.. well, the Moto X Style has a 21Mp sensor which means 9f you size it down to the 16 or 13Mp of most competitors, any difference in detail or noise wil be less obvious when viewed at pixel-level. Motorola are following the same philosophy as Sony in this respect.. Well I don't dare contradict you but are you certain that makes a lot of difference? 36MP to 5 like on the Nokia 808 did, but 21 to 16?. I was all set to buy this and the Nexus 5x came out. Seems like the camera is as good or better in that one and it can actually be used with one hand.. The Nexus 5X is smaller, there is no doubt about that. That said, I am using the Moto X Style with one hand pretty often, I've got large hands though.. If the camera is your primary concern over this phone, $600 (unlocked phone price) will buy you a HECK of a lot more if you just buy a real "stand-alone" camera.. But will it fit inside a phone? I'm already planning to carry a phone 95% of the time.. it's really not rocket science that spending $600 on a camera will get you a better camera than the one you find in a $600 smartphone. It's because the camera doesn't do most things the smartphone is capable of.. Well, there's always the Panasonic phone with the larger sensor I guess.. Any news on Marshmallow for this?. Motorola are usually pretty quick in updating their OS, that's one advantage of the almost pure Android version I guess.... Great review of an excellent phone. It's good to see some competition to the iPhone in Android land. How did you like Madrid, Lars? :). Thanks! And yes, I do like Madrid :). Great review ! Congrats DP ! Motorola also did his homework..

It's not a handset with universal appeal, but for those looking for a big screen flagship at a decent price the X Style is an excellent option.. The Motorola Moto X Style arrived as part of a duo earlier this year, with the Moto X Play sliding in below the flagship X Style.. It sports flagships specs and a pure Android experience, as Motorola looks to mix it up with big boys at the top end of the market.. In the US the Moto X Style is known as the Moto X Pure Edition, but aside from the name it's the same phone.. SIM free prices start at US$399.99 (around AU$545) for the 16GB Moto X Pure Edition (which isn't available in the UK), and you can head over to the firm's Moto Maker website to personalise your handset.. The 32GB model will set you back US$449.99 (£360, around AU$615) while the 64GB model tops out at $499.99 (£434, around AU$680). As part of the customisation you can choose the type of back you get with a range of plastic covers to select, while real wood and leather options will cost you $25 (£20) extra.. You can select an accent colour for the metal bar around the camera on the rear, and the speaker grills on the front, plus there's an option to have your name, or a message, engraved on the rear.. Motorola really wants you to make this phone yours, but if you walk into a retailer you won't get such options - black, champagne and white will be the only options that greet you.. It is priced comfortably lower than its rival 2015 flagships however, although it's a little pricier than the disruptive OnePlus 2 .. With a 5.7-inch QHD display, hexa-core processor, 3GB of RAM and a 21MP rear camera the Moto X Style sounds like a pretty good deal - but has Motorola been able to deliver? Let's find out.. OK, there's no getting around this - the Moto X Style is a bit of a beast. The sizable screen size is your first warning that this won't be a small handset and that's confirmed by its 153.9 x 76.2 x 11.1mm vital statistics.. That 11.1mm thickness is pretty noticeable too, especially when many smartphones now rock a sub-10mm girth, with the likes of Samsung, Sony and Apple boasting flagship handsets at less than 8mm.. The slightly curved rear allows the Moto X Style to sit a little more snugly in the palm than the Galaxy S6 or iPhone 6S , and the soft touch rubberised back on my review unit provide a decent level of grip.. It's one of the weightier handsets on the market too - unsurprisingly considering its size - and at 179g you'll certainly notice it in your hand and pocket.. Motorola's done well putting the X Style together, with the metal frame running round the circumference of the phone providing a sturdy finish and a slightly premium look.. It's not in the same league as the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ , iPhone 6S Plus or Samsung Galaxy Note 5 , with these devices offering far more premium finishes, not to mention thinner, lighter bodies.. They are more expensive though, and considering the X Style's price it's still a well put together device.. The dual front facing speakers do mean it's a little bezel heavy front-on, but you do get improved audio so it's not all bad news.. The power/lock and volume rocker keys are located towards the middle of the right side of the X Style, falling nicely under thumb and finger.. Up top a centralised headphone jack is joined by a tray which can hold both your nanoSIM and microSD card. It's a nifty dual-sided affair and a nice little bit of engineering from the Motorola team.. Motorola has used advanced nano-coating technology to form a water repellent barrier on the Moto X Style, but don't go jumping in the bath with it. As Moto states, this coating protects against "moderate exposure to water such as accidental spills, splashes, or light rain.". It's not quite Sony Xperia Z5 levels of water resistant, but it's definitely welcome.. If you're looking for something a little more durable, there's a new choice from Motorola. Since releasing the Moto X Style, the company has also shared the Moto X Force which is designed to survive most drops and not break easily.. In the US it's called the Moto Droid Turbo 2 and considering it's one of the most durable phones on the market right now, it is actually quite well designed.. Those with smaller hands will find the Moto X Style a bit much in the palm, and even I had to employ both hands a lot of the time to ensure the handset didn't hit the deck.. But if you're looking for a well designed, big screened smartphone without a flagship price tag the Moto X Style certainly offers a compelling argument.. The Moto X Style sports a great screen, but it's also a big one. At 5.7 inches the X Style will simply be too big for many. The Moto X Play is slightly smaller at 5.5 inches if you fancy something a little more manageable in hand.. With a QHD resolution of 1440 x 2560 the X Style's screen is crisp and sharp. Motorola has opted for an IPS LCD panel which means colours aren't quite as vibrant as its AMOLED rivals, but it still looks excellent.. There's no cut and dry auto-brightness setting on here, rather an "adaptive brightness" toggle which does a similar job, but is less extreme. That's fine most of the time, but I did find at night the screen on the Moto X Style could be unnecessarily bright. A waste of precious battery life.. Next Page Interface and performance.

Motorola Moto X Style preview and samples. Motorola Moto X Style preview and samples. Motorola Moto X Style preview and samples. The Moto X Style is Motorola's brand new flagship smartphone and replaces the 2014 edition of the Moto X .. We've had a chance to try the new model before launch, and we took. it out to capture a range of sample shots in varying light conditions.. In the camera department, the new model has received a complete overhaul and now comes with a Sony IMX 230 1/2.3-inch 21MP BSI CMOS sensor and a fast F2.0 lens. A dual-LED flash is on board as well. There's also a new imaging software feature, the user-activated night mode, which uses increased sensitivity to better expose very dark scenes and freeze motion and reduce the risk of image blur in low light. However, image size is reduced to 5MP. Images can be viewed and composed on a 5.7-inch quad-HD screen.. The two images below were taken in bright sunlight and as you can see with its 21MP image sensor the Moto X Style is capable of capturing impressive fine detail. Images are sharp but not over-sharpened. Some noise is visible in the blue sky but despite the high levels of detail and therefore presumably low levels of noise reduction, it is overall very well under control. Sharpness is generally good across the frame but our test unit shows some softness toward the top right corner.. Below you can see two more bright light samples. Again, they show impressive fine detail. Colors are pleasantly natural and exposure spot on.. The next two images were taken indoors which made the camera increase ISO to 80 and 250 respectively. White balance and color are very good under the partially artificial light. The ISO 80 shot still shows excellent detail. Some noise is creeping in in the mid-tones but is very well under control. The same is true for the ISO 250 image on the right that shows very good edge definition and decent detail for the light level it was taken in.. For the night shot below on the left the Moto X Style camera increases ISO to 500. There is some noticeable noise in the mid-tones but noise reduction and detail retention are very well balanced and there's a lot of detail in the brighter parts of this image. The auto white balance system is dealing very well with the different light sources as well. Shadow noise is getting stronger in the shot on the right but again, there's still a good amount of detail for a low light image.. The left image below was taken in pretty low light at dusk. Fine detail is clearly starting to suffer in these conditions but edge definition, exposure and color are all very good. ISO 2000 is as high as the camera will go in standard mode. As you would expect the image doesn't look great when viewed at 100% but is perfectly usable at web resolution or small printing sizes. In very low light it can also make sense to opt for the night mode which we have a closer look at further down the page.. We also had a quick look at some of the special modes in the camera app. As you can see below HDR mode is capable of recovering a good amount of clipped highlights while maintaining an overall natural tonality of the image. There is a very slight drop-off in sharpness but you'd only notice at a 100% view.. Night mode increases ISO to achieve faster shutter speeds and reduce the risk of image blur. When the standard mode gets to its maximum ISO 2000 sensitivity you can also achieve a brighter exposure in night mode which can go up further to ISO 2500. On the downside, image size is reduced to 5MP. For the night shot below standard mode used ISO 640 and a shutter speed of 1/24 sec. Night mode achieved a faster 1/24 sec by upping the ISO to 1000.. ISO 640, 1/15 sec Standard exposure. ISO 1000, 1/24 sec Night mode. Panorama mode seems unchanged from previous Motorola models. It produces panoramas with very good stitching but the images are much smaller with less detail than some of the panorama functions on competing high-end models.. Vertical panorama, 3304 x 696 pixels. We did not have too much time with the new Motorola Moto X Style but we like what we have seen so far. Image detail in bright light is impressive, and in lower light a well-balanced approach to noise reduction means that a lot of detail is preserved while noise isn't getting too intrusive until the very highest sensitivity levels. We're looking forward to doing some more intense testing and putting the Moto X Style through our full review process soon.. Tags: review , mobile , android , motorola , news , samples.

Those ISO 50 shots are impressive. Blows the current X out of the water.. The first gen Moto X was garbage - it did not have removable storage. Why should I go with (reward) a company when they finally start getting it right after previous fails?. ooh, great picture , great camera. My last moto x 1 foward facing camera broke. I think this had to do with maybe the twist action (or maybe some internal hardware that was out of place). Any assessment on the wrist action feature's affect on performance over time?. just in case i missed this .. does this support raw with lollipop?. you'd think that they did the nexus 6 with raw support, that it would roll over onto the Moto X style.. I think this sucker will be my next smartphone that will end up breaking on me after i drop it.. Moto X 2014 has great HDR photos..... I am looking forward to Sony M5 which might use the same sensor (in rumor) and comes in smaller size of body (I really hate anything above 5.0 inch). Not a bad phone especially for $399. I still wish they keep mp to 12 or 13 to get better night shots.. Hmm, looking at the first pic in the garden with shutter 1/380. The detail is indeed impressive in the foreground, but then looking into the background, the trees seems a little mottled or water colored. Could this be possibly due to the Noise reduction algoorithm, or is the just the way the image processing engine is interpreting the trees in the background?. IMNSHO, if raw saves aren't possible then the camera is a joke.. that's a little harsh, there aren't that many phones that do Raw yet..and I bet around 0.1% of all users actually use the feature.... But if we're talking about so-called 'advanced'-sensor camera phones for photo geeks, maybe not so much. Did Sony write the noise reduction software? I haven't seen watercolors like that since the Victorian era.. Great review! How about a review of the LG G4? Most tech guys on youtube says it has the best camera. I'd like to read your opinions of it.. we actually published our review of the G4 a couple of weeks ago or so, have a look on the site, I am sure you'll find it :). Is there manual mode ? RAW photos ??? (Android 5.1.1). no, not supported on this phone. What a fault ! Android 5.1.1 API provides it.. Congrats to DP ! I am impressed with the speed of review.. Here I was applauding that another manufacturer has been doing their homework in the imaging department but then I saw no OIS? Heck, the Nexus 5 had it and it works beautifully and that phone's over 1.5 years old now and was not an expensive flagship model. How come? 4:3 is also getting old.. Why do you think that Motorola chose to forgo optical image stabilization for their flagship?. Seems a good camera, although I'd look for a comparison with the 20 MP on Sony Z3+. One other thing, how much of a concern is the nano coating to you guys? Are you comfortable with the thought of it possible getting peeled off from the phone's surface? I mean, the durability of the coat is something which Moto does not comment upon.. Personally I would be concerned about the nano-coating. I have had the phone a few days and I would not even be able to tell that there's coating...I guess that's nano for you :). But I really don't believe tiny smartphone lens's can genuinely resolve 8MP worth of detail let alone 21MP...no way! Its a marketing gimmick, the vast majority of those MP's are just eating up memory while going to waste.. well, I would not quite agree with you. There is definitely a lot more detail in the images above than in the iPhone's 8MP images which would indicate the lenses are capable of resolving the detail. In low light things might look a little differently of course.... @Lars Rehm - Yes the above photos do have more detail than the iPhones 8MP camera, but I don't think its 21MP's worth of detail, just like I don't think the iPhone is resolving a true 8MP worth of detail either.. My point being if Fujifilm's rep says their excellent primes were designed to resolve up to 25MP of detail at APS-C size. I don't believe tiny massed produced plastic smartphone lenses can genuinely approach that level of detail. The physics of achieving these sky-high levels of resolving power are difficult enough on standard size finely ground glass lenses, that's all.. if these lenses were limited to let's say 5MP you wouldn't see more detail on an 21MP camera than on a 8MP camera. The fact that you see quite a big difference means that they have to resolve quite a bit more than 8MP. All these manufacturers are getting really good at making great stuff really small these days.... Gabriel, have you looked at the 100% crops at the start of this preview? It's clearly showing excellent detail; albeit at base ISO and in the centre of the frame... I'm surprised by how good the image quality is; there are a fair number of compact cameras on the market which wouldn't resolve as well.. @ GabrielZ I agree and there's no way of getting away with it except choosing a reduced image size.. IMHO this one, mainly for the software.. well, yeah, you get almost "pure" Android and 21MP vs Oxygen and 13MP with OIS on the OnePlus...trouble is buying one of the latter actually isn't as easy as you'd wish ;). And a problematic (for some folks) One Plus one device. With Motorola, you would get good support. OnePlus on the other hand has very poor support. Ask folks who had issues with OnePlus One.. I have yet to receive my OnePlus One invite. I hope they don't lose my OnePlus2 invite. Moto X Style has advantages such as a removable SD card slot...a rare feature for new phones these days. And of course Google's official support meaning you get the updates first.. Motorola Moto X Style comes with 21MP camera and front flash. Motorola Moto X Style / Pure Edition camera review.

Moto X Style Review: Falling a Bit Short. Roydon Cerejo , 20 October 2015. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Motorola struck a chord with Android purists with the original Moto X back in 2013, and it resonated loud and clear in India too. Since then, the company has been on a winning streak with very successful launchesin the budget and upper mid-range phone segments. The company's outgoing flagship, the Moto X (Gen 2) ( Review | Pictures ), added some much-needed improvements to the camera and battery performance of the original. Today, we have the third generation of the device, but instead of calling it 'Gen 3', Motorola has gone with the name Moto X Style or Pure Edition, as its known in some countries. Motorola Moto X Style in pictures. The Moto X Style features incremental updates in most areas and fixes one major gripe we had with its predecessor, which was the lack of expandable storage. But is this enough to make it a must-have for those shopping in the Rs 30,000 segment? Motorola's own Google Nexus 6 ( Review | Pictures ) retails for around the same price point today, and offers very similar specifications as well as the added advantage of being the first to get the latest flavor of Android. Let's see if the Moto X Style can manage to win the hearts of Android purists.. Look and Feel The one thing we really love is that Motorola has stuck with its iconic design language, which makes the Moto X Style instantly recognisable. It's not a head-turner by any means and one could easily mistake it for a Moto G (Gen 3) ( Review) , which is the company's current value offering. This is only in terms of looks though, as the phone feels very premium when you actually hold it. The metal frame and soft-touch rubber back feel very comfortable, and give you adequate grip too. The Moto X Style is also noticeably heavier at 179g, and fatter, measuring 11.1mm in thickness.. The power and volume buttons are well within reach, with the former featuring a coarser texture to make it more easily identifiable. The Micro-USB port is placed at the bottom while the 3.5mm headphone socket and SIM/microSD card tray sits on the top. The Moto X Style sports front-facing stereo speakers as well as an LED flash for the front 5-megapixel camera. There are three infrared sensors spread along the edges of the front fascia which are used to activate Moto Display. There isn't a notification LED but then again, you don't really need it since Moto Display gives you a lot more information by simply hovering your palm over the screen.. The Moto X Style packs in a 21-megapixel primary camera, which is lifted from the Moto Turbo ( Review ). There's also a dual-LED flash unit just beneath the sensor, followed by the Motorola logo. This recessed logo would have been a great spot for a fingerprint sensor, which we're hoping will feature in next year's upgrade. Finally, there's a non-removable 3000mAh battery underneath the back cover.. The size of the display has been bumped up from 5.2 inches to 5.7 inches and so has the resolution, which is now Quad HD (1440x2560). The Moto X Style also gets an IP52 certification which makes it dust- and water-repellent. While all these improvements are welcome, we're a little disappointed that Motorola went with a TFT display instead of a Amoled panel like it has with its earlier flagships. Don't get us wrong, the display is very good in terms of brightness levels and colour saturation, but we miss the inky blacks and vividness that we're used to on Motorola's previous flagships. This also affects the way Moto Display functions, as the entire screen now has to be lit up as opposed to just the pixels which show you the notifications. Last but not least, there's Corning's Gorilla Glass 3 for protection.. The phone is packaged in a much more elaborate retail box than previous models have been. Inside, you'll find the charger, headset, SIM ejector tool, instructions, and a clear plastic bumper case. The case is a nice afterthought but makes the phone bulkier and ruins the look so you might prefer going without it. The bundled charger supports Motorola's TurboPower feature which promises 8 hours of use with a 15-minute charge. Unfortunately, it's not modular so you can't use the cable to connect the phone to a PC to transfer data.. Specifications and Software The Motorola Moto X Style rocks a relatively new Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 SoC, which is a hexa-core chip with four ARM Cortex-A53 cares and two ARM Cortex-A57 cores. There's 3GB of RAM and 16GB or 32GB of onboard storage which can be expanded by up to 128GB. Other specifications include 4G LTE (Band 40), Wi-Fi b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.1, GLONASS, NFC, USB OTG and Miracast. Wireless charging and FM radio are absent.. Android purists will really love the Moto X Style for its Nexus-like software. You get vanilla Android 5.1.1 out-of-the-box with a guaranteed update to Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Motorola has added its usual suite of apps including Connect, Migrate, and a new consolidated app for Assist, Actions, Voice and Display simply called Moto. You also get the slightly tweaked Gallery app which can create a 'highlight reel' from your recent photos and videos for easy sharing. We've already talked at length about Motorola's gesture and voice features in the Moto G (Gen 3) review and the Moto X (Gen 2) so we'll just skim over them here.. Moto Voice is similar to Google's voice search feature, which lets you perform tasks like making calls or searching the Web by simply speaking. You can set up a launch phrase which wakes up the voice assistant when the phone is in standby. Training it to record the launch phrase is a bit of a pain but once set up, it works well.. Moto Display lets you see your notifications without having to turn the display on. You can even block certain apps from showing notifications through Moto Display. Moto Actions now lets you turn on the torch by performing a double karate chop gesture, while Moto Assist can automatically perform a set of preset tasks when you're driving, in a meeting, or sleeping.. Performance With no custom skin bogging Android down, performance is very snappy. The interface is smooth with no noticeable stutter in transitions and when multitasking. The phone handles demanding games and apps very well. We noticed that it does tend to get warm rather quickly, even when watching standard definition video content for long periods.. The Snapdragon 808 SoC posts some good numbers in benchmarks. AnTuTu gave us a score of 47,990 while GFXBench returned 24fps. However, these figures are only marginally better than last year's model, which had the Snapdragon 801 SoC, and is at times inferior to the Google Nexus 6, which is powered by the Snapdragon 805. This doesn't make the Moto X Style a slouch by any means, it's just that the performance improvement isn't much when compared to its predecessor.. Call quality is good and the phone easily latched onto 4G networks wherever possible. In fact, we managed to get a strong 4G signal where other phones sometimes struggle. There's also LTE support for both SIM slots.. The phone handles video playback very well. All our test files, including high-bitrate ones, played without a hitch. Watching videos or listening to music is especially enjoyable thanks to the front-firing stereo speakers. The sound doesn't distort at high volumes and is easily audible even in noisy environments. The audio and video player is from stock Android Lollipop, although Motorola has added an 'Audio effects' option in the Settings app which lets you tweak the audio for the headset and speaker. Speaking of the headset, audio quality is quite average and the ear buds don't sit in your ear comfortably.. The 21-megapixel camera looks great on paper but in reality, it's strictly average when compared to other flagship phones. Landscapes and macros look good on the phone's display but zooming in reveals a lot of missing detail. The post-processing in the camera tends to make a mess of finer details in the picture, which is noticeable once you zoom in. Motorola has also stuck with the same annoying autofocus system, which feels outdated when compared to other implementations. You have to drag the reticule around to focus as tapping the screen will immediately take a picture. Low-light shots aren't very good either, and appear blotchy.. We do like the half-carousel design for quickly changing camera settings. For video, we now have 4K along with 1080p and 720p slow-motion. Recorded videos are good, especially 4K, but slow-motion videos are pretty poor. It's not about the resolution being limited to 720p but more to do with the quality itself, which appears interlaced. Thanks to the expandable storage however, you should have no reason to not shoot in 4K all the time. The front-facing camera does a decent job at taking selfies, and the flash comes in handy in low light.. Battery life on the Moto X Style is a bit disappointing as well. We only managed 7 hours, 52 minutes in our video loop test, which is less than what the Moto X (Gen 2) delivered. We feel the two probable reasons for such an underwhelming performance are the QHD screen and the power-hungry SoC. With everyday usage, we just about managed to squeeze out a full days' worth of usage but then we had to consciously keep gaming and camera usage to a minimum for this.. Verdict The Motorola Moto X Style is far from the home run we were expecting, which is quite disheartening. All the ingredients are present on paper but somehow they just don't come together, and the end result leaves you wanting more. We like that the company has stuck with the philosophy of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' when it comes to the design and has only made things better by adding metal to the construction. The phone also checks all the boxes when you consider expandable storage, 4G LTE, general performance, and a good display.. The trouble is that Motorola's very own Google Nexus 6 poses stiff competition to the Moto X Style and, it's a tad less expensive as well. It has a more powerful SoC, better battery life, wireless charging, and optical image stabilisation for the camera. If expandable storage isn't much of a concern then we recommend picking the Nexus 6 over the Moto X Play. The former doesn't support LTE on Band 40 but it does support Band 3, so you will be able to use it once other carriers roll out 4G later in the year. The LG Nexus 5X is another option to look out for if pure Android is what you're after. However, we'll only know how good (or bad) it really is once we test it so we'll reserve our judgment on that for now.. As a flagship, the Motorola Moto X Style is a little tough to recommend at its current price, especially when you have a much better all-rounder such as the Google Nexus 6 going for roughly the same amount. Unexciting camera performance and battery life continue to haunt Motorola's flagship phones, which prevents the Moto X Style from becoming an otherwise excellent package..

The big daddy of the Moto X family. We are part of The Trust Project. Ever been told you don’t know how to sell yourself? It’s a nightmare for job hunters and all those semi-pro online daters. It seems like maybe the Moto X Style used to have that problem, and decided the ‘style’ angle was the best way out.. This isn’t a stylish phone, but a bigger £380 take on the Moto X Play. It’s a bit fancier, sure, but doesn’t belong on the catwalk.. Instead, it’s a Moto X Play with more power, more pixels and a bigger screen. The only major sour note is that the battery life is not good. It’s a good job that the charger zips it up from zero in minutes, then.. Let’s take a closer look at the whole ‘Style’ thing. Motorola justifies calling its new top-end phone this because whereas the Moto G and Moto X Play have plastic sides, the Moto X Style uses a band of metal.. It’s a bit like company selling plastic and metal forks and insisting on calling the latter ‘catwalk cutlery’. Maybe this point has stuck with me because I’m using the white version of the Moto X Style. I’ve nothing against white phones per se, but the white Style doesn’t half show off that the front of the handset is absolutely peppered with tiny little sensors. It looks like the phone equivalent of a swiss army knife.. Pro tip: consider the black version carefully. 7 things you need to know about the Moto X Style. Enough of bashing the Moto X Style with Gok Wan’s naughty stick, though. It’s a decent-looking phone, and feels pretty good too. This is the only one of the 2015 Moto X phones to use a fully enclosed design, meaning the back isn’t just a plastic battery plate you can pull off with a fingernail.. So rather than using under-the-hood slots for the SIM and microSD slots, the cards fit into a tray that pops out from the phone’s top. There’s no flexing to this phone and while the back is plastic, it’s nicely soft to the touch.. The metal surround does add a touch of class too, and as with all current Moto phones, the curvy design helps disguise that at its thickest point the Style is a chunky 11.1mm thick. The body is nano-coated, giving it IP52 protection as well. That means it’s impervious to dust, and can withstand water sprays but not being submerged. In other words, heavy rain is fine, just don’t drop the Moto X Style down the toilet.. Other than being mis-sold as a ‘Style’ phone, the only other thing to hold you back on this Moto’s design front is its size. The Motorola Moto X Style feels quite a lot like a slightly-shrunk Nexus 6 , because that’s basically what it is.. It loses just enough width to stop seeming like an almighty stretch like the Nexus , but it is a handful. More so than the similarly-5.7in Note 5 , anyway. Just make sure your mitts are up for it. Mine are, but I did automatically switch over to two-handed typing.. The next question: is the screen worth it? On the specs front, absolutely. The Moto X Style has a 5.7in 2560 x 1440 pixel display, getting you a massive canvas that can convincingly justify the upgrade from 1080p.. I’ve been using the phone to watch some films and TV episodes in the gym, and it’s just perfect for the task. Those looking for a cheaper media monster than the Note 5 could do a lot worse. Like the Moto X Play it has a nice relaxed colour tone, although I actually prefer the tone of the Play.. In our review sample, there was a bit of backlight bleed at the top and bottom of the screen too. This is fairly common in LCD screens like the Moto X Style’s, and shows up as a brighter area of the display.. As a result, the Style’s screen comes across as bigger than the Moto X Play ’s display, but not flat-out better in all respects. Bear it in mind if the quality promise of the ultra-high resolution is reeling you in right now. It’s a good screen, not a perfect one. I also found that while there are ‘natural’ and ‘vivid’ settings available, switching between them barely seems to make any difference. The Moto X Play is the Style's feature-trimmed sibling. One of the real joys of the Moto X Style is that it doesn’t have any appy bloat on it. There’s the Migrate app to help you transfer stuff from your old phone and one bonus Moto app, but for the most part this acts as an extension of the Settings menu, letting you tweak all those extra little bits of functionality Motorola has squeezed into Android. These include gestures that let you, for example, turn the torch on with a karate chop motion. And you can set rules, based on times and your location, that let you fine-tune how the phone rolls in day-to-day use.. The best Motorola extra, though, is Moto Display. It’s kind of like a custom lock screen, a way to display notifications as they come in. It often rules out needing to even get as far as the normal lock screen. It’s also why there are so many little sensors on the front, letting the Style tell when you’re waving a hand over the screen.. Aside from these little extras and a custom camera app, the Moto X Style’s software feels and looks just like that of a Nexus device. So close that it has many of Android 6.0 Marshmallow ’s traits even though the phone currently runs Android Lollipop , the last version.. The Google Now interface, the default Android ‘look’ used here, has already been bumped up to use the new vertical style of apps menu we first met when trying out Android Marshmallow on the Nexus 6. You might not get Android M , but it sure as hell feels like it already. All we’re missing that really matters is the new Now on Tap digital assistant feature.. Fingers crossed it won’t take Motorola too long to upgrade.. The Moto X Style has a Snapdragon 808 CPU and a generous 3GB helping of RAM. While the 808 isn’t quite as powerful as a top-tier Snapdragon 810, with six cores instead of eight, it also sidesteps most of the overheating problems that top dog has been plagued by.. I’ve been using the Moto X Style for all sorts of things over the past week: video, browsing, a healthy dose of Bean’s Quest. Not once did it get nearly as toasty as the Sony Xperia Z5 does just from five minutes of mobile internet browsing.. It’s doesn’t really lack much raw power either. The Snapdragon 808 vs 810 is a case of our 808 having two Cortex-A57 power cores instead of four, and a lower-end GPU.. Ultimately, if devs really start challenging our phones’ GPUs again rather than making Clash of Clans clones, the Moto X Style might start feeling the pressure before a Snapdragon 810 rival. But it does do just fine when I max out the graphics in Riptide GP2 , which still one of Android’s more challenging games. So I’m inclined to shrug my shoulders and think, ‘Eh, it doesn’t really matter.’. In Geekbench 3 the Moto X Style scores 3470 points. That’s about 700 less than the Snapdragon 810 would achieve, but still a lot more than the lower-end Snapdragon 615 and 410 crowd, including the Moto X Play .. Now we need to address where the X Style lags way behind the X Play : battery life. It has a 3000mAh unit where the smaller, lower-res Play has a much bigger 3630mAh battery.. While I was happy but not exactly bowled over by the Play’s stamina despite the gigantic battery, the Style’s is pretty mediocre. Reminiscent of the LG G4 but even worse in terms of performance, it’s dead easy to drain it down in a day if you’re going to stream music, browse a bit or play some games. Only pretty light users are going to get comfortably into day two without plugging the phone in.. It does pretty badly when just playing video too, lasting nine hours twenty minutes when, for example, the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 lasts for a whopping 15 hours. The result ranks below the Sony Xperia Z5 and LG G4 , two phones that also offer pretty so-so stamina in my experience.. This is the reason not to buy the Moto X Style. Make sure you’re up for such a high-maintenance battery.. There is a silver lining, though. The phone’s battery charges incredibly quickly when you use the bundled charger. Not only does its standard output sit at 2.85A (most phone chargers are 1A or 2A), the voltage cranks all the way up to 12V when using its turbo gear.. We’re talking about going from 0 per cent to 90 per cent in under and hour. This is something the cheaper X Play doesn’t have, but I’d still much rather have a phone that lasts a solid day and a half even with proper use. Don’t say we didn’t warn you.. Things perk up again with the camera. It uses the same 21-megapixel Sony sensor as the Moto X Play , and it’s a pretty good little package.. Its 1/2.3in sensor is the same size as that of a lot of compact cameras, and it’s a lot of fun to use too. I had more fun using the Moto X Style than the higher-end-sounding Xperia Z5. It uses the same camera app as the Moto G .. The more I use this, the better I think it is. It’s pretty simple and uses a draggable ‘aiming’ reticule rather than tap-touch focusing, which can take some getting used to.. The cherry on top, though, is the exposure compensation dial that sits just by this focus element. Giving you easy control of the brightness of your photos is a new thing everyone seems to be bunging into their custom camera apps, but Motorola’s is the best version of the feature thar I’ve seen so far. The draggable focus just makes it fit in that bit better.. The Moto X Style also has a great Auto HDR mode and, most important, feels quick all-round. There’s no annoying shutter lag and focusing is quick. It even has fancy phase-detection autofocus, built into the sensor. This helps the camera stay quick even when the light level drops.. Image quality is generally very good, with less of the ugly noisiness I found in the Xperia Z5 , which has a similarly high-res sensor but actually shoots at 8MP resolution to keep noise at bay. The one area where the Moto X Style camera doesn’t do quite as well is at night.. Without OIS, I had to take multiple frames of any night scene just to make sure I got one that was sharp-ish, and even then the image quality tends to be just OK, not great. It’s more proof that even with a good sensor, a phone really needs stabilisation to be in with a chance of decent low-light photos.. One top tip that I completely forgot to make use of most of the time while testing is that you can actually hold a finger down on-screen in the camera app to ‘burst’ shoot. It’s the best way to make sure you end up with at least some sharp night shots.. Other than that, though, the Moto X Style takes pretty consistently good photos. It has good auto dynamic range adjustment, colour is generally pretty good and strong contrast ensures plenty of punch. It’s only in middling indoors lighting that the ‘dithered’ look of the noise reduction system is a dead giveaway that we’re dealing with something that's ultimately not going to push over any DSLRs.. Still, it’s good fun to use.. Where the Moto X Style actually goes above and beyond what you get with most phones is around the front. Its selfie camera has a flash.. It’s not a two-tone one like the one on the rear, but a bright white single-LED one that has enough power to even out any harsh window light at arm’s length.. It’s a lot more convincing than the ‘screen glow’ flash of the iPhone 6S , that’s for sure. It’s still a 5-megapixel sensor so will still be working with slightly limited detail, but there are few better for dingy dive bar selfies. Just remember: those hard flash shadows are rarely flattering. That said, I did find that it can really warm up faces, so it can often make you look better at times.. Around the front, the Moto X Style’s speakers aren’t too shabby either. It has a stereo pair, marked by those silvery bars above and below the screen. That’s right: unlike the X Play you get actual stereo speakers, not just the appearance of them.. They’re significantly louder than the BoomSound speakers of the HTC One M9 and co, but do sound a bit more strained and less ‘natural’ at top volume. HTC’s famous speakers end up sounding more composed, offering higher actual sound quality. But sometimes volume is what you need, eh?. The Motorola Moto X Style is a phone that gets you the sort of specs you might end up paying £100-200 more for from another company. It’s a great deal, especially if you’re out for a big a screen as your hands can handle and don’t mind missing out on extras such as a finger scanner.. That big screen doesn’t reach the heights of something like the Note 5 , but there are few other phones I’d rather watch Netflix on.. The only feature that really drags it down is battery life, which is pretty poor. Even by the standards of this year’s stamina-shy flagships. Still, if you think you can live with that, there's a lot to like here.. The 10 best smartphones in the world right now. 5.7in 2560 x 1440 IPS LCD. 21MP with flash, 5MP front with flash.

In the US, the phone will be known as the Moto X Pure Edition and will have universal LTE banding, allowing it to work in any carrier. The company also unveiled the Moto Play , which boasts longer battery life, but comes with a smaller screen. And it showed off a revamped version of the Moto G , its best-selling smartphone of all time, which is available today and which costs $179.99.. The lineup continues Motorola's strategy of embracing a "pure," or unaltered, version of Android, the software that powers the majority of the world's smartphones, a legacy of its time as a unit of Google. That emphasis, along with the Moto Maker customization system, which allows you to tweak the colors and materials used on the device, has helped it establish credibility in a market dominated by Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S smartphones.. The smartphones represent the first major update since. Lenovo acquired Motorola from Google in October. The new products indicate that Lenovo is keeping its promise to give Motorola wide latitude in how it operates. Motorola Chief Operating Officer Rick Osterloh has previously said that he believed Lenovo would allow him to continue his strategy.. Lenovo acquired Motorola to gain entry into more traditional markets where the Chinese company hasn't had a strong smartphone presence, including in the US. It is the world's largest PC manufacturer, but only the fifth largest smartphone maker, according to. The Moto X Style comes with a 5.7-inch quad high-definition display for crisper images, the ability to quickly charge (it charges 34 percent of its battery in 15 minutes) and a soft-grip back. Like other Moto X smartphones, it can be heavily customized via Moto Maker. It will be available in September.. Motorola pushed to improve the camera to focus faster, to capture more light and to reproduce better color. The Moto X Style will have a 21-megapixel camera, plus a 5-megapixel front-facing "selfie" camera with wide-angle lens.. "It's the best we've ever built," said Jim Wick, head designer for Motorola.. Motorola is opting to sell the Moto X Pure Edition in the US directly to consumers on its own website and through retailers like Amazon, as opposed to going with carrier partners.. The Moto X Play, meanwhile, will get a 3,630-mAh battery, which means it can last two days on a single charge, and the company says you can get up to 8 hours of charge in 15 minutes with its turbocharging capability. It also has a 21-megapixel camera and 5-megapixel front-facing camera. It has a 5.5-inch full high-definition display.. The Play smartphone will be available in August, and will sell for $300 to $400 less than the standard premium phone. It too can be customized via Moto Maker.. While the flagship Moto X smartphones have earned the praise of Android purists, it is the more affordable Moto G smartphone that has helped win Motorola market share. The Moto G is the company's best-selling smartphone of all time thanks to its combination of decent specifications for a low price of $180 without a contract. In comparison, a high-end smartphone like the iPhone 6 retails for $650.. Motorola also improved the Moto G, adding a waterproof coating on the device. In addition, it boosted the camera by giving it a 13-megapixel rear shooter, as well as a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. The phone will come with 4G LTE as a standard feature, as opposed to an add-on as before.. You will also be able to customize Moto G with Moto Maker, a first for this model of the smartphone.. Motorola also unveiled two accessories, the Moto Pulse, an over-the-ear headphone for $59.99, and the Moto Surround, a band that wraps around your neck with ear buds that can be extended to your ears. Both are wireless and connect to the phone with Bluetooth.. Be respectful, keep it clean and stay on topic. We delete comments that violate our policy , which we encourage you to read.

Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ review: the curvy ‘iPhone 6 Plus killer’. iPhone 6S Plus review: barely better than the iPhone 6 Plus. Motorola’s Moto X Style aims to be a flagship smartphone on a budget, with a big screen, curvaceous body and quality camera.. Also known as the Moto X Pure Edition in the US, it’s Motorola’s second Moto X model after the Play , which had a smaller screen and a bigger battery.. The Moto X Style looks like any other Motorola phone released in the last two years. The all-glass front has front-facing speakers which operate in stereo, some presence sensors for gestures and now a front-facing LED flash to go with the selfie camera.. The back is curved, covered in your choice of plastic, wood or leather, and the sides are aluminium. There’s a metal accent bar connecting the camera to Motorola’s characteristic dimple. The build is solid, although the unit I have has a tiny gap between the glass screen and the metal band at the top.. At 11.1mm thick and weighing 179g, the Moto X Style is considerably chunkier and heavier than, for example, the 6.9mm thick, 153g Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ .. But it feels solid, comfortable and ergonomic in the hand. The curved back also makes it one of the easiest phablets to hold, but while one-handed use is possible at a stretch, the top of the phone is out of reach.. The 5.7in 2K LCD screen is excellent and Motorola’s best yet. It is on a par with likes of the LG G4 and Samsung’s latest phablets. It appears pin-sharp with a pixel density of 520 pixels per inch, is bright and easily readable in direct sunlight and has great viewing angles. It’s not quite as vibrant as some AMOLED screens such as that on the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ , but could be considered to be more realistic for viewing photos and video.. The Moto X Style uses Qualcomm’s six-core Snapdragon 808 processor, which is not the latest or the most powerful available, but also does not suffer from overheating issues. It’s the same one used to great effect in the LG G4 and performs equally well in this device.. The phone is one of the snappiest you can find on the market today, on par with any of the top Android smartphones at the moment performing similarly to the Galaxy S6.. The processor handled everything I threw at it without issue, including games. It didn’t get particularly warm even under heavy use. The 808 might be less powerful for some tasks, but most people won’t notice or even care. Call quality was excellent and hands-free calling particularly loud.. The Moto X Style lasted an average of 26 hours during my testing, which was enough to see me safely through a day and a night out, but it had to be charged every night. That was with 3 hours of browsing and listening to music via Bluetooth headphones, hundreds of push notifications and emails, 20 minutes of gaming and a couple of photos a day.. This is pretty average when smartphones from Sony and others can last two days or more with similar specifications, but the Moto X Style charges quickly reaching 55% in 50 minutes.. Motorola ships its Android smartphones without software customisations. They are as close to Google’s Nexus devices in those terms as you can get. Motorola instead spends its time optimising the software, which is one reason why it is quite so snappy.. The standard Android Lollipop experience is very good and those bits that Motorola adds are actually useful, apart from the camera app (more on that below).. Motorola’s Moto app adds a couple of features to Android. Gesture support is excellent allowing users to karate chop to light the flash as a torch or twist your wrist with the device in hand to fire up the camera app. The phone can also turn on or off Wi-Fi or other settings based on location and time of day.. Motorola’s active display detects when the phone is approached with a hand with its presence sensors and lights the display with notification icons and the time.. Holding a finger on the icon previews a small snippet of the message or notification. Users can then dismiss or unlock the phone to see the rest of the message. It’s a better user experience and consumes less battery than Android’s stock “ambient” display.. Moto Voice adds to Google Now with more voice control options including a custom hotword that the user can change to fire up the voice command system without having to touch the phone. It works well in the home or office, but struggled outdoors on a busy street. I’m not sure why you’d want to use it on the street – it feels awkward talking to a smartphone when no one can see you, let alone in public.. The camera is the first one fitted to a Motorola smartphone that I’ve thought was actually good. The 21-megapixel camera was excellent in good lighting, producing photos with good colour balance and detail – better than the Moto X Play .. It struggled in low-light conditions more than some rivals, producing some muddy photos when I expected it to be fine.. Video capture is also strong, with 1080p at 60 frames per second and 4K if only at 30fps.. The 5-megapixel selfie camera is very good, producing bright and detailed shots making it one of the best. The flash on the front will make some selfies better, but its throw was short making it a bit anaemic more than an arm’s length away.. As good as the camera is, the camera app is poor. Motorola’s made it tap to capture rather than tap to focus. I found it routinely failed to focus correctly, producing images that were not as sharp as I would have liked. It worked fine for selfies, but not for rear-camera shots of anything with detail in the foreground.. A drag to focus mode is available, but I found it clumsy to use and in the end switched to the equally simple to use but much better Google Camera app.. The Motorola Moto X Style costs £360 for 32GB of storage without customisation. It is also available from Motorola’s Maker site, where accents, backs and storage can be changed starting at £400 for 32GB and £434 for 64GB.. For comparison the LG G4 is currently available from £320 and the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ currently costs £580. The 5.5in Motorola Moto X Play costs £250.. With the Moto X Style, Motorola is trying to replicate a winning formula: offer a great smartphone experience for less than the competition.. Costing £360 it is around £220 cheaper than its rival Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ and offers a similar experience. The only things notably lacking from the Moto X Style are a fingerprint sensor and wireless charging, which hurt its future proofing. Its battery life of just over one day could also be better.. The Moto X Style has an excellent screen, feels good in the hand, has a good camera, very snappy performance and runs stock Android without any bloat. In fact, the Moto X Style is essentially a Google Nexus smartphone but with a microSD card slot for adding extra storage.. Pros: great screen, good rear camera, excellent selfie camera, microSD card slot, cheaper than rivals, stereo front-facing speakers. Cons: battery could be better and is not removable, no wireless charging or fingerprint scanner. © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Motorola Moto X Style Motorola Moto X Style review: Now under £300. facebook twitter google+ email Comments. Page 1 of 2 Motorola Moto X Style review: Now under £300 1. Motorola Moto X Style review: Now under £300 2. It's fast and has a great camera, but the Moto X Style is held back by terrible battery life and a disappointing screen. Design Motorola Moto X Style review:. Display Motorola Moto X Style review:. Originally reviewed in October 2015 at £399, the. Motorola Moto X Style has significantly dropped in price and now has limited availability. It can now be found for around £250 via eBay. At the time of the review, it just wasn't worth it, as it was surpassed in value by its cheaper cousin, the Moto X Play or the similarly priced and much more impressive, Sony Xperia Z5 Compact .. A proper phablet compared to the smaller Moto X Play, the 5.7in 2,560 x 1,440 display is what really set it apart, along with the faster 1.8GHz Snapdragon processor too. There were high hopes for the Moto X Style, but disappointing features such as the lacklustre screen really set it back.. Now that it's ageing, the question to ask is whether the Moto X Style is still a bit of a mediocre phone or, now that it's cheaper, does it come much more recommended this time around?. At first glance, the Moto X Style certainly puts forward a convincing argument. When holding both phones in my hand, the Moto X Style is clearly the superior product, as its sculpted metal frame feels much classier to the touch. The very slim 6.1mm edges only add to that sense of premium build quality.. At 76mm across, it is rather wide, but its smaller bezels actually mean it's only 1mm wider than the Moto X Play. As a result, it's no more difficult to hold and I can still just about reach across to the other side of the screen one-handed. I need to adjust my grip to reach the top, but this is to be expected given its size.. Motorola Moto X Play review: Still a solid choice. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact review: One year on. I'm also pleased to see the Style's machined power button and volume rocker also don't rattle and shift in the chassis like the Moto X Play, and I much prefer the Style's grippy, soft-touch rear panel over the Play's slightly more rubbery finish. It's very similar to the 3rd Gen Moto G , only slightly softer. Whereas the Play's rear panel is removable, allowing you to swap it out for a different colour if you fancy a change further down the line, the Style's back panel is fixed, leaving no room for further. As with all Motorola handsets, though, you can personalise your handset through the Moto Maker service at no extra cost. You can choose the colour of the frame and front of the handset, the metallic accent on the back of the handset and the type of rear panel, including a variety of soft grip colours as well as wood and genuine leather. The latter two options cost an extra £20. You can also increase the internal storage from 32GB to 64GB for another £35, but when you can mount a microSD card on the back of the SIM card tray, you'd be better off spending the same amount of money on a 128GB microSD card instead.. As great as the phone looks and feels, though, it all starts to fall apart when you drill down into its specs. For instance, the Moto X Style's 5.7in, 2,560 x 1,440 display has a distinctly yellow colour cast, as whites were much warmer than those on the Moto X Play and Sony Xperia Z5 , which has one of the most colour-accurate displays I've ever seen. Initially, this led me to believe the Style must be using an AMOLED panel, as Motorola hadn't specified the type of panel it used when it was first announced. However, it's since been confirmed to be using an IPS display, which makes the colour cast all the more disappointing.. Its colour accuracy rating is still reasonably high, covering 93% of the sRGB colour gamut, but it makes little difference when images look obviously oversaturated. Admittedly, it does lend images an eye-pleasing vibrancy, but I prefer the slightly cleaner, cooler colours on the Moto X Play. You can change the colour mode in the Settings menu, but even switching over to Normal makes little difference. Likewise, the Style's black levels were also higher than the Moto X Play, measuring a rather mediocre 0.48cd/m2. This is a shame, as its high brightness of 502.07cd/m2 gives it great outdoor visibility and a contrast ratio of 1,045:1 provides plenty of detail in darker pictures.. The most disappointing part of the Moto X Style is its atrocious battery life. In our continuous video playback test, it lasted just 8hrs 54mins when the screen brightness was set to 170cd/m2. This is terrible for a phone with a 3,000mAh battery, and is more than four hours less than the Moto X Play.. Motorola X Style Black UK Sim Free Smartphone.

Motorola Moto X Style Smartphone Review. Daniel Schmidt ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 11/15/2015. Android ARM Touchscreen Smartphone. The Moto X Style is the flagship of Lenovo's American subsidiary, and can be customized even more than its sister models. It also sports stronger hardware and a better camera. Its 5.7-inch screen makes it quite bulky. Despite all that, there is still room for improvement..

Moto X Play , a smartphone of the upper mid-range, Motorola tops that and offers the Moto X Style (aka. Moto X Pure Edition) that is to be seen as the. However, the buyer does not get real. high-end since the review sample is powered by a. On the other hand, the Moto X Style has a comparatively low price starting at 499 Euros (RRP, ~$535). A wooden or leather back costs 20 Euros (~$21) extra. Doubling the internal storage to 64 GB adds 45 Euros (~$48) to the price, making up to 564 Euros (~$605) possible. Our review sample is the lowest priced model.. The Moto X Style pursues the trend of increasingly bigger screens, and has an impressive diagonal of 5.7 inches. Not many of these giants are found in the premium range yet. Samsung's Galaxy S6 edge+ , particularly the upcoming. Microsoft Lumia 950 XL has to be mentioned.

The casing design of Motorola's Moto X Style resembles that of the. cannot be styled as colorfully, and are a bit more conservative. The review sample is quite heavy weighing 177 grams (~6.2 oz). is 24 grams (~0.9 oz) lighter despite its identical screen size. The Moto X Style does not break any. records in terms of height, either. The manufacturer states 7.5 millimeters (~0.3 in) at the edges and up to 10.6 millimeters (~0.42 in) in the tallest part. We even measured as much as 11.1 millimeters (~0.44 in). That is relatively bulky, but the smartphone is nevertheless comfortable to hold. The difference becomes very evident when compared directly with a slim device like the. We liked the phablet's build quality. The gaps are narrow and even, and the metal bezel supports the high-quality impression. Only the card slot does not close quite flush with the casing. By the way, it accepts nano-SIM and micro-SD cards. The screen is Corning Glass 3 protected, and the grooved rubber back provides a good grip. A water repelling finish additionally protects the Moto X Style against splashes and rain.. The review sample will completely satisfy individualists. The smartphone's design can be configured quite freely in the Moto Maker. For example, there are three bezel colors to choose from, and the camera and speaker components can be configured. The options of back covers are especially lush. Ten different plastic covers and four wood or leather alternatives are available here.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. The micro-USB port of Motorola's Moto X Style only meets the 2.0 specifications, and does not support either MHL or Slim Port. However, it is OTG capable, making it possible to connect external storage devices or input devices to the smartphone.. The micro-SD slot supports memory cards with a maximum capacity of 128 GB. Apps can be moved easily to the additional storage providing that they support that. Bluetooth 4.1 and NFC are also installed, and Wi-Fi Direct is supported.. An infrared interface is not on board. The manufacturer does not install a fingerprint reader, either.. Motorola stays on the safe side in terms of operating system, and preloads the pure Google Android 5.1.1 Lollipop without modifications. Proprietary apps are also kept within limits. The Moto app provides central access on the most important settings for smartphone control. For example, it is possible to configure the screen's standby behavior, adapt or personalize voice control, and to discover more about the Moto X Style's motion control. Motorola Connect also adds a Cloud service.. An update to the newest Google Android 6.0 Marshmallow is in the making. However, an exact date has not yet been stated..

Motorola's Moto X Style sports a Wi-Fi module that supports the current IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac standards, and can thus transmit in both the 2.4 and 5.0 GHz frequency. Our review sample's Wi-Fi connection range was good. The connection quality was still decent even at a distance of approximately 15 meters (~49 feet) to the access point (Devolo dLAN 1200+ ac), and websites opened without noteworthy lags.. The smartphone can access Internet on the go via HSPA+ (max. 42 MBit/s downstream) or high-speed LTE Cat. The latter has a broad frequency coverage, and supports all common bands in Central Europe. However, some bands that the Moto does not yet support will be added in the course of network expansion in the next years. That can be tolerated in view of the lack of LTE Cat. The Moto X Style uses both GPS and GLONASS satellites for localization. It found satellites even indoors within 15 to 20 seconds. The tracking accuracy was good in both cases.. The smartphone competed with Garmin Edge 500 bike navigation system in the practical test. The Moto did not exactly shine with accuracy here. It was far off track in the area of a railway underpass. Crossing the channel bridge still functioned well, but the device had problems with the subsequent tight pathway. It nevertheless only displayed a difference of 200 meters (~0.1 miles) on a total route of approximately 11 kilometers (~6.8 miles) - a decent outcome..

The call quality of our Motorola Moto X Style is really good. We understand our contact very clearly when holding the device to the ear. An audible noise is only heard in quiet moments. We are also clear and static-free at the other end. The speaker also does a good job, and transmits the voice very clearly and loudly. Although it echoes marginally, it is definitely one of the better ones.. Motorola's Moto X Style sports two light-sensitive cameras. The front-facing unit delivers up to 5 MP (f/2.0, 2592x1944 pixels) and shoots decent photos that are suitable for the one or other selfie. However, noise develops quickly in low-light situations. The front LED can help by retrieving some residual light even in the darkest conditions.. The primary camera with up to 21 megapixels (f/2.0, 5344x4008 pixels) not only offers a higher resolution, but also much better image quality. The range of dynamics is quite decent and the sharpness in the photo's center is also good although it decreases strongly toward the edges. The Moto X also has major issues with backlight, as can be seen well in Scene 2. The area of the leaves in front of the sky is almost indiscernible and deteriorates to blurry formations. Low ambient light is not the Moto's strong point. Intense noise becomes visible quite soon, and the photos are comparatively dark. The review sample is sufficient for occasional snapshots but it will not replace a camera.. Videos can be recorded in Full HD or Ultra HD with the Moto X, but only with 30 frames per second in both cases. While that is still standard for UHD, we would have hoped for more frames for Full HD videos. The presented quality is decent, and sufficient for short recordings.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. Moto X Style: Screenshot of ColorChecker colors. We displayed the original color in the lower half of every patch.. We took a picture of the X-Rite ColorChecker passport under controlled light conditions to examine the color accuracy of the camera in Motorola's Moto X Style. The lens' automatic mode was enabled for this. The pictures are compared without post-processing, and a subsequent white balance is not performed, either.. The picture already shows that the review sample displays the colors somewhat more intensely. Primarily pictures with blue parts are particularly intensive. The automatic white balance is a bit too warm, which is highly visible in the grayscale levels.. We took a screen-filling picture of our test chart for the sharpness test. The 100 percent image sections are from the objects center, and are quite sharp thanks to the high resolution of the camera in the Moto X Style. However, the outlines look a bit frayed when looking closer. The photo's sharpness decreases gradually towards the edges of the chart, and the outlines fade.. Motorola Moto X Style Motorola Moto X Style. Apple iPhone 6s Plus Apple iPhone 6s Plus. Sony Xperia Z3+ Sony Xperia Z3+. Although the included accessories do not disclose surprises, the box is quite heavy. In addition to a tool for removing the card tray, the device is shipped with a big power supply that adds a weight of 117 grams (~4.3 oz), and which is twice as heavy as that of other smartphones. Unfortunately, the cable cannot be removed. We also miss the option of recharging a second device with the power supply, like in the. Motorola does not yet offer any accessories designed just for the Moto X Style.. Motorola includes a 24-month warranty on its product.. The 5.7-inch, capacitive touchscreen in Motorola's Moto X Style provides plenty of room for inputs. The coated Corning Gorilla Glass 3 surface has very good gliding traits. The touchscreen always responded accurately and was always very sensitive everywhere in the test.. Motorola uses the stock keyboard layout from Google's Android 5.1 with a very straightforward design, but is very suitable for inputting. When preferred, other keyboard apps can be downloaded from the Play Store.. The manufacturer again adds some features to voice control. However, not much has changed here when compared with the Moto X from last year. Voice detection functions very well and reliably.. The volume rocker and power button are easy to tell apart with the finger. Both input controls have a clear pressure point and crisp drop.. Motorola relies on a 5.7-inch IPS screen with a lush QHD resolution (2560x1440 pixels, 16:9) for its Moto X Style. That equals a pixel density of approximately 515 PPI despite its large panel, and it is thus razor-sharp. The resolution and size are identical with that of the. The screen's illumination of 92 percent is very homogeneous. The review sample achieves a maximum brightness of 546 cd/mÂ² on a pure white surface in maximum settings. We even measured as much as 613 cd/mÂ² when the sensor was enabled.. However, the measurements using a consistent APL (average picture level) is more significant. We selected an equal distribution of light and dark areas (APL 50) on the screen. The brightness in the screen's center was then only 494 cd/mÂ².. It looks similar with the black level. The device appears to dim its screen slightly on a solid black surface, and reaches 0.55 cd/mÂ². It is 0.74 cd/mÂ² at APL 50. Black is not particularly good in either case, and looks rather gray. The comparatively high black level has a negative effect on the contrast ratio, as well. 815:1 is not bad, but it is far from a top rate. When using the ascertained APL rates for calculation, the Moto X Style only manages 668:1. A weak rate for a high-end product.. 517 cd/m² 503 cd/m² 504 cd/m² 546 cd/m² 538 cd/m² 528 cd/m² 536 cd/m² 543 cd/m² 540 cd/m². 92 % Center on Battery: 538. cd/m²) ΔE Color 2.63 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 3.24 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.17.

Motorola's Moto X Style has two different display modes. Both deliver good results in grayscale and color reproduction. Normal Mode is a bit more accurate. That is because the color saturation in Vibrant Mode is marginally stronger. Seen only subjectively, the colors look brilliant and very vibrant. The grayscale shifts are virtually not visible for the naked eye. A minor bluish tint is vaguely perceived at most on very bright surfaces. The mixed color reproduction is also very precise. The color shifts for magenta are visible to a trained eye only in Vibrant Mode.. Grayscale (display mode: vibrant, target color space: sRGB).

That is not distracting when looking directly on the screen, but it could slightly impair legibility in somewhat flatter viewing angles.. The smartphone's comparatively weak contrast is most noticed when the sun comes out. The high maximum brightness tries to retrieve as much as possible, but the reproduction remains relatively pale.. Left to right: Galaxy S6 edge+, Moto X Style, iPhone 6s Plus. Reflections are annoying even under cloudy skies. The viewing angle stability of Motorola's Moto X Style is very good. Even extremely flat viewing angles do not lead to the slightest color deviation, and the brightness hardly decreases. The Zero Gap touchscreen additionally prevents ghosting..

Motorola's Moto X Style has a 32 GB eMMC flash memory, and a 64 GB model is also available. The storage is quite fast, and is particularly convincing in sequential reading and writing of small data blocks. The other rates are also quite decent, but the rivals outbid them. It even outperforms all rivals in Basemark OS II.. The micro-SD slot supports cards up to 128 GB capacity. We tested the speed with the fast Toshiba Exceria SD-CX32UHS1 micro-SD card (max. 95 MB/s read, 60 MB/s write). The Moto achieved up to 87.5 MB/s primarily when reading data, which is very close to the test card's limits. The write rates (38.5 MB/s) were also good..

A large screen and stereo speakers are the best preconditions for mobile gaming. The integrated Adreno 418 GPU from Qualcomm provides plenty of power for that purpose. A rare stutter is only noticed in more demanding games, such as " Asphalt 8 ", in maximum detail level. The superb touchscreen and impeccably functioning sensors round off gaming fun.. The performance advantage of the Moto X Style over the smaller Moto X Play is noticeable when playing Dead Trigger 2. The Play is not powerful enough when playing on High quality settings.. Motorola's Moto X Style presented lightly increased surface temperatures in the area of the earpiece just in idle mode. It reached up to 36.2 Â°C (97.16 Â°F) here. The rates climbed to over 40 degrees Celsius (104 Â°F) on most parts of the smartphone under permanent load, and reached up to 41.3 Â°C (106.34 Â°F). That is comparatively high, but not disconcerting.. The inner temperature development is more significant. We checked the temperatures on the SoC and the effects via the Battery Test of GFXBench 3.1. The T-Rex Test runs thirty times in succession while the application records data quite comprehensively. Contrary to what the surface temperatures suggest, the Moto X Style copes quite well with the heat. Although the rates on the SoC climb to over 45 Â°C (113 Â°F), it does not have an impact on performance.. 41.1 °C 40.7 °C 39.7 °C. 41.3 °C 40.9 °C 40.6 °C. 41.2 °C 41.1 °C 39.8 °C.

Both front-sided stereo speakers in Motorola's Moto X Style are well positioned, but might be covered during gaming. While trebles could be more clear and bass more pronounced, particularly in low ranges, it has a decent maximum volume resulting in sound quality that is very good as far as smartphones are concerned.. The audio jack is convincing, and conveys sound output very clearly and static-free subjectively.. The power consumption of Motorola's Moto X Style is on the expected level. The rates can be higher in standby, though. It climbs to 0.7 watts when the notification display is enabled. The always-on voice control generally increases the power consumption by another 0.1 watts, as well.. The smartphone's power supply might be bulky, but it also supplies plenty of power and charges the device very fast. Fifty percent is accomplished within 22 minutes. The Moto is recharged by three quarters within 38 minutes, and a full recharge is possible within 78 minutes.. Off / Standby 0 / 0.2 Watt Idle 0.7 / 2.2 / 2.3 Watt. The 3000 mAh battery in Motorola's Moto X Style is relatively weak. We would have hoped for a somewhat stronger battery in view of the large screen and bulky casing.. Our expectations were correspondingly low, and they were unfortunately confirmed. The review sample is at the low end in the comparison field, yet performs well under load - which will primarily please gamers. The Moto X Style pays for the long battery life in the Reader's Test with a very dark screen that only shines with 7 cd/mÂ² in the lowest brightness level. However, that is still sufficient for reading in the dark.. Most users will nevertheless manage a day with the phablet. An additional battery should be at hand for those who use their smartphone extensively and also like to play an occasional game.. Idle (without WLAN, min brightness) 19h.

In review: Motorola Moto X Style. Review sample courtesy of Motorola Germany.. With Motorola's Moto X Style, the buyer opts for a good smartphone that we can recommend despite minor shortcomings. The device is pleasant to hold despite its size, and can be personalized like no other. The high-resolution screen convinces with its color accuracy, but shows weaknesses in sunlight.. The camera could be somewhat better in view of the price range. It is, however, sufficient for an occasional snapshot. The battery life represents a good effort, but as all its runtimes lag behind the rivals, the Moto X is unfortunately not for people requiring long runtimes.. The Moto X Style is a giant with rough corners and edges for individualists.. The unmodified stock Android version ensures very good system performance, and will receive an update to the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Even voice control functioned well as always in the review sample, but has not been developed any further. The RRP is comparatively low for a premium range smartphone, but the Moto X Style will have a hard time competing with the rivals since their prices have dropped sharply in the meantime. Wood and leather back covers are no longer a unique selling point, either.. Motorola Moto X Style - 2015-11-06 11/06/2015 v4 (old) Daniel Schmidt. Read all 1 comments / answer.

Comparing The Motorola Moto X Style/Pure And Moto X Play Smartphones. August 10, 2015 at 5:50 AM.

Rest of World: £360, €500 Canada: $400 CDN. $305 U.S.) Rest of World: £280,. Last week, Motorola announced three new phones: the Moto G (3 rd gen), Moto X Play, and Moto X Style. If you want to get technical (beyond the fact that two of them are called Moto X’s even though they are completely different devices), there is also a fourth device: the Moto X Pure, which is simply the U.S. name for the unlocked "pure" Android version of the Style. Naming conventions aside, the fact is that there are two different Moto X’s, the Play and Style, and clarity on their differences would be useful. The Moto X Style (check out our hands-on ) is the premium flagship phone with all the bells and whistles. It will be available in Europe, Latin America and North America (and as the unlocked "Moto X Pure" in the U.S.).. The Moto X Play is a midrange flagship with lower specifications that will be also be available in Europe, Latin America, and Canada, but not the U.S. It is a little confusing that both phones are called Moto X’s,however. Only the Style is proper follow-up (as in premium device) to last year's Moto X. Although we get that Motorola wants to leverage the cachet of its flagship brand, we do wish that perhaps the Play was called a Moto S or something similar. This would make it clear to potential buyers that it is a mid-range device.. Now that we've hopefully explained at a high level what the differences between the two Moto X’s are, let's have a look at their specifications in detail and compare them.. Looking at the Moto X Style and Play, you can see the first major differentiator is the choice of the SoC. The Style uses the Snapdragon 808, a hexa-core chip in a big.LITTLE configuration. This chip has an Adreno 418 GPU that, although it's not as fast as the Adreno 420 found in the older 805 or Adreno 430 in the newer 810, is still more than capable of powering a Quad HD display.. Although we haven't published our results yet, our time testing the 808-powered LG G4 has shown that it is probably the best and most balanced mobile SoC currently available. It suffers none of the throttling issues that plague its big brother, the Snapdragon 810. Of course, there are still a few compromises in addition to the GPU – the 808 also only supports DDR3 RAM and has a less powerful ISP (Image Signal Processor).. In contrast, the Moto X Play is equipped with Qualcomm's best mid-tier SoC, the 615. This is an octo-core chip, but while that sounds more impressive on paper than the 808's six-core, the 615 has eight slower cores. Instead of a big.LITTLE CPU configuration, it runs two clusters of four Cortex-A53 CPUs at different clock speeds. The 615's performance shows that more cores doesn't always necessarily mean more power.. Although we haven't spent enough time with a 615-powered device to draw any final conclusions, our initial impressions are not too favorable. It simply isn't a very fast SoC. Although it should be adequate to power the Full HD display of the Play, its slower CPU cores and GPU put it at a marked disadvantage to the 808 of the Style. In fact, our initial results show that the Snapdragon 801 found in last year's Moto X (2014) is faster than the 615! So in the SoC department at least, the Play is a downgrade from its predecessor.. Both the Play and Style have bigger screens than the Moto X (2014), at 5.5- and 5.7-inches, respectively. The Style's larger screen is a Quad HD IPS LCD, and the Play's is a Full HD IPS LCD. The move to LCD over AMOLED this year should mean brighter displays and hopefully more accurate colors. It does mean though, that the power consumption of the ambient mode of the Moto Display app is going to be higher.. It is also important to note that despite these larger displays, the screen-to-body of both models is excellent. The Moto X Style boasts a ratio of 76 percent, one of the best of any current smartphone, and the Play's is not that far behind. These excellent ratios mean that the Style and Play are two of the most compact large-screened devices out there. The Style is slightly smaller than the Note 4 and much smaller than the iPhone 6 Plus, and the Play is about the same size as the Moto X (2014) despite having a 0.3-inch bigger screen.. The camera is one area that Motorola has paid a lot of attention to, with its intent to offer "best in class" imaging experiences on all of its new phones. Both the Style and Play use Sony's latest 21MP Exmor RS IMX230 sensor. This is a large 1/2.4" sensor that has advanced features such as Phase Detect Auto-Focus (PDAF) and HDR in 4K video. Motorola has combined this sensor with a wide f/2.0 sensor and Dual Color Correlated Temperature (CCT) flash. The wider optics will help in low light, and the CCT flash will produce flash-lit images with more accurate colors.. Although it is impressive that Motorola didn't skimp on the camera hardware in the cheaper Moto X, the Play's camera does have one big issue. The ISP in the 615 SoC is not as powerful as the Style's 808 ISP. This means that the Moto X Play, unfortunately, cannot shoot 4k video. There is also some confusion about whether the Play supports PDAF. Motorola told us that it does, and the Qualcomm spec PDF for the 615 does mention PDAF support. Even so, there is no mention of this feature on the Play's spec pages, so we'll need to get to the bottom of this.. On the front, both phones have 5MP shooters, but the Style benefits from better optics with a wider lens and also a front facing (regular, not CCT) flash. Perfect for overlit washed out selfies!. Both models have adequate internal storage options, the Style available with up to 64 GB, and it is good to see that both have microSD slots. As for power, the combination of a 3,000 mAh battery, 808 SoC and QHD display means that the Style's battery life should be similar to the LG G4. Our testing of that phone has shown that it is good for a 2015 device, but it's still down on some of last year's best devices.. On the other hand, one of the big strengths of the Play is its huge 3,630 mAh battery. A battery this size combined with an FHD display and lower-powered SoC means that the Play should last a long time. Motorola claims up to 48 hours of "mixed usage," and we are sure it is not too far off from reality.. Along with the battery size, because neither phone has a removable battery, Motorola's answer to better battery life, like everyone else this year, is fast charging. Both Moto X's support Motorola's TurboPower charging, which is its name for Qualcomm's Quick Charge 2.0 tech. The speed at which Quick Charge can juice up a battery is determined by the output of the charger.. From what we were told, the Moto X Pure will come with a 25-watt Turbo Charger, and the Play gets a slower 15-watt Turbo Charger. We are not sure if the Moto X Style outside the U.S. will also come with the 25-watt or a 15-watt unit. Unfortunately, neither phone supports wireless charging. Admittedly, this is a niche feature, but it would still be nice to have. Still, including it, even on the higher-end Style/Pure, would probably have impacted the cost too much, and that $400 starting price would go up.. For connectivity, the Style/Pure supports an almost overwhelming number of LTE frequencies. You should be able to use it on almost every carrier in the U.S. and Europe, including CDMA carriers like Verizon and Sprint in the U.S. The Moto X Play isn't blessed with as many bands, and there are two models supporting different frequencies. The Canadian model will work on any GSM U.S. The last feature we want to highlight -- well, it's more like missing feature -- is a fingerprint reader. Neither phone has one, which is surprising; we expected to see one on at least the Moto X Style/Pure. Again, like wireless charging, a fingerprint reader is currently a niche feature. However, when Android Pay launches later this year, it will be an almost essential feature to have on your device to authenticate mobile payments.. Motorola boasted about the "pure" stock Android nature of the software it installs on its devices, and the next version of Android (Android M), is going to include integrated biometrics. With the expectation that the new Moto X's will get Android M sooner than most other OEM's devices, not being able to use one of its core new features is going to be disappointing.. The overall look of both the Style and Play is similar, and both contain Motorola's traditional design DNA. They have a new metal bar that runs down the middle below the camera, ending in the characteristic Motorola logo dimple. This dimple looks nice and is a comfortable place to rest the end of your index finger when holding the phone. The build quality of both phones is superb, and they are both very attractive devices.. Where the two Moto X's differ is the shape of the back and the materials used. The Style has a rounded back, similar to that of the Nexus 6 and Moto X (2014) surrounded by a metal frame. The Moto X Play is, unfortunately, all plastic and has a flat back surrounded by "vacuum metalized paint finished resin." We guess that sounds a lot better than simply saying painted plastic. The standard material of the back of both models is what Motorola is calling "coated silicone rubber" (CSR). This material has a nice smooth, soft touch finish that resists fingerprints.. As you can see from the chart above, both the Moto X Style and Moto X Play are among the most customizable of any phones on the market. Using Motorola's Moto Maker site, you can order the Style/Pure in 10 different CSR colors and four different woods or leathers. You can combine those options with seven metal accent colors and three different metal frame colors (that determine the color of the bezel surrounding the screen). The wood and leather backs will add around $25 to the price of the phone.. The Moto X Play comes with only CSR back choices. You cannot get it in wood or leather, which makes sense because of its price point. The Play is available in 14 different colors with seven metal accent color choices.. One important thing to note is that Moto Maker is only available in certain countries, and only for unlocked devices ordered directly from Motorola. Those countries are the U.S., UK, France, Germany, Mexico and Brazil (and not Canada). If you buy a Moto X Style or Play from a carrier or another retailer, your color choices are limited to black, bamboo and white for the Style, and black and white for the Play. Well, that is unless you live in the Great White North. There the Play only comes in black. At least it never goes out of fashion.. Let's just say right off the bat that the pricing for the Moto X Pure Edition is fantastic. A phone with its specs for $400 (even if it is just the 16 GB model) is an incredible bargain, and there is no phone that comes close to its value. Even the higher storage tiers are reasonably priced, and don't forget that it also has a microSD slot. It's a pity, then, that this value only applies to the U.S. The Moto X Style in Europe (if you convert the GPB and Euro costs to USD) is quite a bit more money for an identical device.. The Moto X Play's pricing is a different story. Although at $400 CDN ($305 U.S.) it is a reasonably priced phone, at that outright price I would rather just spend the extra $100 and get the much better X Pure. Of course, that would be if you could buy the Play in the U.S.. At the end of the day, though, the outright price of a mid-range carrier device like the Play isn't important. Most Moto X Plays will find themselves in someone's pocket tied to a contract, and it will probably be a $50 CDN phone with one. In Europe it does look like there is enough of a price difference between the Style and Play that the latter is a good value for its market.. The Moto X Play is coming out in August and will be available in Europe, Latin America, and Canada, but not the U.S. Unfortunately, 16 GB of storage along with the black back is the only configuration of the Play for Canada .. The Moto X Style/Pure is coming out in September and will be available in Europe, Latin America, and North America. It is interesting to note that Motorola said "North America" for the Style, not just the U.S. While the Play is the only device officially announced for Canada at this time, we are sure that the Style will be coming to Canada, too.. What Canadians will not get, though, is the unlocked Pure Edition. Canucks will only be able to get one from a carrier. Also, we don't expect the Play to ever come to the U.S. market, even later in the year. Motorola said in its blog that they'll instead "have more choices for you all later this year," probably referencing new Droid-branded phones coming in the fall.. We do want to say for U.S. readers that if you are a Motorola fan and are considering crossing the 49th parallel to get a Moto X Play, don't. Because of the deficiencies of the 615 SoC, the Play is not an upgrade from the Moto X (2014), which is still available from Motorola unlocked for $300 .. The Play is slower, made from plastic and built to be a mid-range phone. Last year's Moto X is still a flagship. The only two features the Play has over the older X is its bigger battery and better camera. Also, any software updates and enhancements the Play has or gets will more than likely come to the Moto X (2014), too.. That's why, with the hardware choices and pricing, Motorola's decision to call the Play a "Moto X" is confusing. It still looks to be a great mid-range phone, but it should be called something else so as not to muddy the "X" brand. Still, we will want to wait until we test the Moto X Play properly before passing final judgment on it.. As for the Moto X Style/Pure , after my brief hands-on with it at the New York launch event, I'd have to say it is my most anticipated smartphone. It appears to be almost the perfect Android phone. It's made from premium materials with an excellent build quality and has a wide variety of customization options. Its hardware specs were intelligently chosen to offer a balance of performance and efficiency, and it has everything I want, apart from a fingerprint reader. Its camera looks great on paper and from the sample shots we've seen, which is very important to me, and it runs almost stock Android. It also starts at only $400..

The "pure edition" is NOT pure Android. This was the first thing motto clarifyed. The old "pure" edition was pure Android. This time pure is an illusion to the fact that they a "pure" Motorola devices free of carrier input, either in physical design or software. The "pure edition" will have all the cool moto stuff, active display, always on, ect, ect.. And on an off topic note, Google really needs to work on there auto correct.. That's why I used quotation marks around pure and didn't say stock Android. Though other than the small amount of Moto apps, Android on Motorola's phones is as close as you'll get to stock Android without buying a Nexus device.. This article starts out completely wrong.

This time pure is an illusion to the fact that they a "pure" Motorola devices free of carrier input, either in physical design or software. The "pure edition" will have all the cool moto stuff, active display, always on, ect, ect.. Moto X phones are quite nice. I still like the near-clean design of the UI that is unmatched by anything else on the market, which makes the phone a joy to use. The new Galaxy phones with their glass back should scare the shit out of anyone. I have the first gen MotoX that is almost 2 years old. The camera still sucks and is a major reason for my desire to upgrade. But to me, a major selling point of the original Moto X was that it was NOT GIGANTIC! The new Moto X is a full inch larger at 5.7". I've played with the slightly larger Moto Nexus model and I don't like the size. But I guess market data shows that the sales are in the larger screens I love the look of the new MOTO-X, but wouldn't mind a 5.3" model... but guess I'll be stuck with the Style/pure with its somewhat confusing name.. MotoX could have made it more of a leader by having USB 3 Type C connector. How hard is that? This is why Apple is still the leader and everyone else is catch-up. Even GS6 has taken a step back by going USB3 to USB 2, ugh.. What is the big deal with a USB connector Type C anyway?. MotoX could have made it more of a leader by having USB 3 Type C connector. How hard is that? This is why Apple is still the leader and everyone else is catch-up. Even GS6 has taken a step back by going USB3 to USB 2, ugh.. Can the unlocked version do CDMA + LTE + GSM? I have US Cellular (CDMA+LTE) and it would be great to be able to take this phone overseas; pop in a SIM card from some carrier, and connect on GSM. (That could be done on an older Motorola phone, but when US Cellular got LTE, it was no longer possible to have a Motorola phone that would do all the bands).. Its the replacement of the long-time current mini connector which SUCKS. Its works like the Apple Lightning connector - which does work very well as I've played with the iPhone6. You don't have to see which end is "up" on the cable or the phone or both... in other words, its a double-sided mini connector that is the new spec. I'll still likely get the phone or maybe the 3rd gen Moto-G because its a 5" screen and half the price. The new G and X phones have a slot for adding a microSD chip... Going through the MotoMaker as I'd customize it like my org MotoX... it'd be $220 for the 16GB model.. What is the big deal with a USB connector Type C anyway?.

With its stunning design, high-end specs, and low price tag, Motorola’s Moto X Style Pure Edition is the true flagship killer of 2015 -- and heartily recommended.. Excellent value for the $400 price. Design your own phone with Moto Maker. I never feared that I’d drop it, thanks in part to the texture, the sturdy metal frame, and the slightly curved back. Although it’s a big, iPhone 6 Plus -sized phone, the Moto X doesn’t feel unwieldy or tough to hold. That gentle curve makes all the difference, which is probably why it’s become so common on larger phones these days.. Top-of-the line specs on a $400 phone. Solid battery life and wicked fast charging. New camera wins ‘Most Improved’ award. These are problems that every smartphone camera has, unless there’s a manual mode as on the LG G4. Is Motorola’s camera as good as those in the G4 or the iPhone 6 Plus? No, but it’s much better than last year’s and as good as (if not better than) the camera on any other phone that you can buy for $400.. Excellent value for the $400 price. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. Motorola Moto X Style Pure Edition. If you can’t beat ‘em with brand power, hit ‘em where it hurts: their wallets. While Apple, Samsung, LG, and HTC try to sell their flagship smartphones for record-breaking prices of $550 and up, Motorola is taking a different approach. It’s selling the brand-new Moto X Style Pure Edition for a more reasonable $400 unlocked. And the new Moto X is just as high-end and powerful as the Galaxy S6 , the iPhone 6 , and the G4. But at a far lower price.. You’ll feel like a celebrity owning something that you designed to suit your tastes – not those of the masses.. The Moto X was down to 30 percent after a long day, and it juiced up to 100 percent in no time at all.. ZTE, OnePlus, and others have tried this tactic, but for a different reason – they are trying desperately to build brand recognition in the U.S, a problem Motorola doesn’t have. Carriers love Motorola – Verizon even has a special relationship with the company and carries its Droid phones exclusively — and anyone 24 or over is likely to have owned a Motorola phone at one point in their lives. It’s a name that has plenty of pull.. Therefore, Motorola doesn’t have to woo anyone with low prices, but it’s doing it anyway, just to prove a point: You don’t have to pay $500 or more for a great smartphone anymore. Really, the company says, you’re just paying for the brand, so why not come on over to ours? Motorola’s got a damn-nice phone to tempt you with, too —meet the Moto X Style.. Motorola’s hardware has always had style in spades, so it makes perfect sense to call its flagship the Style. A slim metal frame encases the phone, which. sports a removable back cover that you can swap any time you want. You can even design your own with Moto Maker. Just like with the previous Moto X , you can choose from various color backs made of genuine Safflano leathers by Horween, real wood, and other materials. You get your pick of 18 different inlays and 7 different accent colors too. So if you want, you can have a sky-blue back with a magenta-pink metal accent next to the camera.. The variety is not only fun, but it’s something you don’t get with any other phone save the OnePlus Two , and that phone’s back cover options are much more limited. It’s the same thrill you get when you design your own Converse sneakers for the first time – you feel like a celebrity owning something that was designed by you to suit your own tastes, not those of the masses.. For our review unit, we went for a more traditional look: a turquoise back cover, white bezels, and a champagne gold frame and accents. The back cover has a nice grip to it and it never picks up fingerprints, which is awesome. Most phones are a disaster when it comes to picking up oily smears, but not the Moto X. The grippy texture also makes the large phone easy to handle.. The Moto X among the most beautiful Android phones you can buy, and it’s fully customizable.. The Moto X is among the most beautiful Android phones you can buy, and the Moto Maker customization options really take personality to the next level. There’s just something about having a unique phone that you designed.. Motorola Moto X Style Pure Edition Compared To. What’s inside the Moto X Style make just as big of an impression as what’s outside. The phone’s 5.7-inch screen packs 2,560 × 1,440 pixels, resulting in a higher pixel-per-inch density than the. iPhone 6S Plus and a bigger screen overall. To put the phone’s compact dimensions into context, the Moto X Style has a. Samsung’s Galaxy Note 5-sized screen, but with tiny bezels and a screen-to-body ratio better than the. All that beauty comes in a shell that’s slightly smaller than the. Naturally, the screen looks fabulous, and when you bump the brightness up, it looks even sharper.. Motorola gave the processor and RAM a boost; much like the LG G4 smartphone , the new Moto X includes Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 808 processor over the problematic 810. While both ZTE and OnePlus are betting on a reworked 810, hoping that it doesn’t overheat as the first version did, Motorola chose not to take the risk. If anything, the 808 matches the 810 in terms of performance, and along with 3GB of RAM, the Moto X offers a fast and powerful user experience.. I didn’t notice any lag while streaming videos, browsing the Web, or any of the normal tasks I do on my phone. The Moto X seems equally zippy in comparison with every other flagship Android phone I’ve tested, from the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 to the LG G4. It doesn’t overheat, though it can get warm when you’re updating 20 apps at once. Although many companies have gotten rid of the once standard MicroSD card slot, Motorola isn’t among them. The Moto X Style comes in 16, 32, and 64GB storage options, all of which can be expanded with a MicroSD card up to 128GB. As such, you can save your money and just but a MicroSD card when you run out of storage. It’s hidden in the same slot you pop your SIM card into, so it’s easy to find. That’s great news for those who take tons of photos and store videos on their phones.. Perhaps the most impressive thing about the Moto X isn’t that it has the same flagship specs as the competition, but rather that Motorola is offering that power and performance for $200-$300 less than Samsung, LG, HTC, and Apple.. Motorola’s well known for its super fast charging and great battery life, but the Moto X Style only meets expectations in one of those two areas. Its battery is simply average, sadly, but Motorola’s fast charging is simply awesome.. The 3,000mAh cell easily makes it through a full day, but can’t last through a day and a half of use. Just like the Samsung Galaxy S6, the Moto X is somewhat disappointing in this respect. It could be the Quad HD screen or simply the size of the battery pack that holds it back. Still, battery life is far from terrible. It’s more or less on the same level as the iPhone 6 Plus.. However, the Moto X charges up wicked fast when you plug it in, so even if you do run out of battery at the end of a long day, you can rest easy knowing it’ll charge up in less than an hour. A TurboPower mode offers 10 hours of power after a mere 15-minute charge. The Moto X was down to 30 percent after a long day at the office, and it juiced up to 100 percent in no time at all. The Moto X Style really does charge much faster than most other phones, even ones with Quick Charging built in. Super speedy charging is ideal for people who are always on the go, and as a journalist who’s always running amok and living off my phone, I can say that it’s a key feature that should exist on every phone.. Motorola’s cameras typically suck – they’ve been the low point on the company’s phones for years now. Motorola has finally fixed this problem. The Moto X Style sports a. 21-megapixel rear-facing camera that takes great pictures. In addition to the higher resolution sensor, Motorola’s added an f/2.0 aperture, Phase Detect Auto Focus, and a Dual Color Correlated Temperature flash, which make all the difference. Finally, Motorola has made a camera that works. It still has some issues in low light and at night, but it’s no worse in those tricky settings than most smartphone cameras.. Obviously, pictures taken in full sunlight look magnificent. The detail captured by the camera is impressive, so even when you zoom in on the tiny cars in a shot from the 22nd floor of our NYC office building, you can tell what they are. The text on a billboard at least 20 stories down is legible. Of course, pictures taken at night and in low light were less perfect, but they were far better than any previous Motorola phone’s camera. One shot of a city street at night taken from up above is sufficiently clear that you can almost read the car’s license plate when you zoom in on it. A few indoor shots in low light turned out reasonably well, too.. That said, the camera does take longer to focus at night, and the images are somewhat grainy. Any lights will wash out nearby objects completely.. $400 is dirt cheap for a phone with this spec sheet.. Meanwhile, the front-facing selfie cam is 5 megapixels, which is quickly becoming the standard for self-respecting Android smartphones. Even the new iPhone 6S line has a sharper selfie cam. The Moto X’s front-facing shooter has a wide-angle lens, too, so you should be able to get your friends in the shot as well.. Pure Android – There’s nothing quite like it. Although Google only owned Motorola for a brief moment in time, it seems that stock Android has really stuck with the company, for which I’m most grateful. Android 5.1.1 Lollipop looks stunning on the Moto X Style, and the complete lack of clutter is refreshing after all that TouchWiz, Sense UI, Emotion UI, (insert pretentious Android skin name here) nonsense you see on other phones.. Motorola respects Android so much it even named the U.S. version of the Moto X Style the “Pure Edition.” Android lovers, this one is for you. Moto Assist and a few other little Motorola features are included, but they are actually useful.. It was love at first sight with Motorola’s Moto X Style Pure Edition. Its stylish, customizable look and high-end specs are certainly tempting, but what will win you over after a week is just how much fun it is to carry around and use every day. The colorful design is more than eye catching — it’s personal. Pure Android runs butter-smooth, and you never have to worry that it’s going to slow down unexpectedly or languish without the latest software update for too long.. Up your game and the get the most out of your gear with the following extras, hand-picked by our editors:. Cimo Premium Slim Flexible Soft Case ($7). If you have to ruin this phone with a case, this clear one won’t cover up your custom design, but it will add some protection.. Mophie Power Station 4,000mAh ($34). Your Moto X is out of battery and you’re nowhere near an outlet? Pack this portable battery pack to juice back up.. You can even go bigger, though 64GB of extra storage should be enough.. What’s most impressive, though, is the sticker price. $400 is dirt cheap for a phone with this spec sheet.. Motorola is all but declaring that the extra $200 or more you’d spend on phones from Apple, Samsung, LG, and HTC is for the brand alone. The Moto X Style has everything its competitors have, and in some cases, its spec sheet is better. Pay less, get more, Motorola says, and it’s a very convincing message.. Now that Motorola’s camera woes are more or less a thing of the past, you can depend on the Moto X to be there for you when you need to capture the moment. The performance is top notch, even though the battery life is par for the course in comparison with this year’s flagships. Regardless, Motorola’s latest Moto X is the true flagship killer of 2015. If you’re looking for a top-end phone with all the bells and whistles, the Moto X Style is the phone for you.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

This score is based on our evaluation of 30. sources including reviews from users and the web's most trusted critics.. What's good Customizable design through Moto Maker Connects to 14 different LTE bands Excellent camera quality in outdoors lighting Very crisp display. What's bad Some slowdown when navigating homepage and playing 3D games Mixed photo quality in low light settings Missing vibrancy and deep blacks of AMOLED displays Horrible battery life. The Moto X Style , known in the US as the Moto X Pure, is Motorola's third iteration in its Moto X flagship lineup. The original Moto X impressed reviewers with its sleek design and Android experience, but does the Moto X Style live up to its predecessors? For most, the answer is yes. One of the biggest selling points of the Moto X Style is its price and ability to connect to 14 different LTE bands. Rather than purchase from a carrier, you order directly from Motorola's site. From there you can use the Moto Maker to customize the phone as much as you like. While you can customize the basic look of the phone, the actual build is similar to the second-gen Moto X. Motorola has taken a "if it ain't broke don't fix it" stance with the design. For some, the phone was comfortable, but for others they found that despite the ergonomically sloped back it was still a bit awkward and difficult to use one-handed. Still, they admit that the comfort depends on hand size so those with larger hands might find it more comfortable than those with smaller ones.. Adorning the front of the phone is a 5.7-inch quad HD (1,440 x 2,560 pixels) LCD display. With a pixel density of 520 pixels per inch, reviewers had no issues with fuzziness or blurriness of text, icons or images. They were a bit disappointed with the move to LCD, however. Although they admit their complaints are more of nit-pick, they found blacks were not very deep and colors not as vibrant as AMOLED displays. The Verge sums it up by saying, "…it's not eye-popping or class leading by any stretch…it doesn't encourage you to stare at it and appreciate its beauty." On the plus side, experts were able to easily view the screen in sunlight as the maximum brightness level was quite bright. On the opposite end, the minimum brightness was also dim, making it much easier for them to avoid eye strain when using their device in the dark.. The Moto X Style comes equipped with a 1.8GHz hexa-core (6-core) processor and 3GB of RAM. When compared to flagship phones of its competitors, critics did notice the Moto X Style was slightly slower even when swiping through the homepage. The lack of power became more noticeable when they played more graphics heavy tasks like 3D games. Still, they note that while it isn't as fast as the likes of the Note 5 or OnePlus 2, it was fast enough for most consumers for years to come. The battery life was the biggest disappointment in terms of internal hardware. While Motorola boasted the 3,000mAh battery would last a full day, most critics were barely able to eke that out with moderate usage with it lasting a little over 5 hours during battery draining tests. Unfortunately the battery is also non-removable so you cannot simply swap out a freshly charged one. With that said, the X Style does come with quick-charging technology and critics were able to get the battery fully charged in less than an hour.. One of the biggest upgrades Motorola made to the X Style is its camera. Rather than a 13MP main camera, it sports a 21MP camera. It also bumped the lens to an f/2.0 aperture, which basically means it captures more light even in low light situations. When put to the test, reviewers were able to get nicely detailed and accurately colored photos in daylight situations. Droid-life notes, "In outdoor situations, this camera might be the best I have ever used" though they add low-light settings often produced mixed results. Other experts had similar results, but overall had few complaints regarding the quality of photos and ease of use.. Although it might be a bit slower than other flagship phones, reviewers fully stand behind the Moto X Style. Bright Hand states, "We like just about everything about it. It's 'just right,' a basic but exception Android smartphone." CNET adds, "All in all, [it's] a reliable and quality-built device…". Motorola’s Moto X Pure Edition is the perfect phone for you as long as you’re not seeking a flashy package.

Motorola's handset impresses in the display, performance and software departments. If it wasn't for the Moto X Style's disappointing battery life, it would be near impossible to criticise.

Stronger hardware and a better camera. With Motorola's Moto X Style, the buyer opts for a good smartphone that we can recommend despite minor shortcomings. The device is pleasant to hold despite its size, and can be personalized like no other. The high-resolution screen convinces with its color accuracy, but shows weaknesses in sunlight.... With Motorola's Moto X Style, the buyer opts for a good smartphone that we can recommend despite minor shortcomings. The device is pleasant to hold despite its size, and can be personalized like no other. The high-resolution screen convinces with its color accuracy, but shows weaknesses in sunlight. The camera could be somewhat better in view of the price range. It is, however, absolutely sufficient for an occasional snapshot. The battery life still ranges within a good field, but all runtimes lag behind the rivals. The Moto X unfortunately is not enduring. The unmodified stock Android version ensures very good system performance, and will also receive an update to the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Even voice control functioned well as always in the review sample, but has not been developed any further. The RRP is comparatively low for a premium range smartphone, but the Moto X Style will have a hard time competing with the rivals since their prices have dropped strongly in the meantime. Wood and leather back covers are no longer a unique selling point, either.. Sturdy and well built but performance lacks fluidity. The Moto X Style can be considered as the big screen alternative to the Nexus 5X, given there similar pricing. That said, the phone provides lesser performance and battery life, which means that the Nexus is the better choice, unless you want a bigger display..

That means it’s another 10k more than the 32GB Moto X Play. What you get is louder and better stereo speakers, front facing LED flash, 4k recording, bigger and higher resolution display and a more powerful processor and more RAM. In the process, what you lose is the great battery life. But apart from that, it is all uphill on the Moto X Style and if you are a power user, I would recommend you to get the Moto X Style and since it has fast charging, the battery life issue is mitigated to some extent. If you aren’t so much of a power user and can do with a slightly slower processor and 2GB of RAM, then the Moto X Play might just be the choice for you and you can save at least 10 grand in the process.. So near and yet so far. As ever with Motorola’s upper-end smartphones, the Moto X Style gets some things bang on, while missing the target elsewhere. The design is great, for instance, but the phone is heavy and thick. The camera is good, but the lack of optical image stabilisation leads to a lot of spoiled shots in tricky light. It charges quickly, but the battery life is lacklustre.... As ever with Motorola’s upper-end smartphones, the Moto X Style gets some things bang on, while missing the target elsewhere. The design is great, for instance, but the phone is heavy and thick. The camera is good, but the lack of optical image stabilisation leads to a lot of spoiled shots in tricky light. It charges quickly, but the battery life is lacklustre. And while it has plenty of attractive features, including front-facing stereo speakers, microSD storage expansion, pure Android and a lack of app bloat, there are notable gaps in its specifications. Eagle-eyed readers will have noticed that I haven’t mentioned a fingerprint reader, wireless charging or an infrared port; that’s because the Moto X Style doesn’t have these features. The big thing in the favour of the Motorola Moto X Style is its price. SIM-free from the Motorola website, the phone starts at £399 for the 32GB model, which makes it £50 less expensive than the similarly sized Google Nexus 6P, and only £20 more expensive than the 32GB Nexus 5X. This should be enough on its own to push the Moto X Style firmly onto your shortlist; it may not be the best, most complete smartphone around, but it sure is good value.. If you want a well priced, super-fast phone benefiting from a slick design and sharp display, I can thoroughly recommend the Moto X Style. It doesn’t confuse with a bucket-load of added features, but it does, it does well.. There’s a lot to say for Motorola’s approach to... If you want a well priced, super-fast phone benefiting from a slick design and sharp display, I can thoroughly recommend the Moto X Style. It doesn’t confuse with a bucket-load of added features, but it does, it does well.. There’s a lot to say for Motorola’s approach to Android too. It’s clean, simple, fast – and as Google intended. With Marshmallow on the way, this is even more important.. Motorola’s best smartphone to date, but just short of perfect. If you want a large, crisp display and fancy that 21MP camera, Moto X Style makes a great option but its unpredictable battery performance makes it fall short of being perfect.. If you want a large, crisp display and fancy that 21MP camera, Moto X Style makes a great option but its unpredictable battery performance makes it fall short of being perfect.. The Motorola Moto X Style is far from the home run we were expecting, which is quite disheartening. All the ingredients are present on paper but somehow they just don't come together, and the end result leaves you wanting more. We like that the company has stuck with the philosophy of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' when it comes to the design and has only made things better by adding metal to the construction. The phone also checks all the boxes when you consider expandable storage, 4G LTE, general performance, and a good display....

As a flagship, the Motorola Moto X Style is a little tough to recommend at its current price, especially when you have a much better all-rounder such as the Google Nexus 6 going for roughly the same amount. Unexciting camera performance and battery life continue to haunt Motorola's flagship phones, which prevents the Moto X Style from becoming an otherwise excellent package..
