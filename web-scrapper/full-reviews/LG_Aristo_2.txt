My last LG phone was my first ever smartphone but it was slow, cumbersome, unresponsive, and quirky. I compared budget phones and the Aristo 2 was a clear winner. The Aristo 2 is highly user customizable since it runs v7 of Android, it's very responsive, did not come pre-loaded with junkware, is very thin, takes awesome high resolution pictures and video, has a decent battery life, and the battery is user replaceable.. Rated 5 out of. Just recently got this phone and the features that come included are really impressive. facial recognition like it says is nice can sometimes be hard to read face but still a nice feature. There is times where it beats me to unlocking the phone when im using my regular unlock code. Smart Cleaner is the first time I notice it on a LG phone but an is awesome feature already included no need for cleaning apps that do the opposite in my opinion. certain apps respond different when you hold them down a bit it gives you quick options rather than just opening the app up completely. Android 7 nougat looks beautiful on the phone, colorful settings. that camera has impressive quality and it lets me adjust the amount of light in the photo really helps out when its in dark settings. Iv had plenty of phones similar in price, size, and specs to this phone but non come included with all these awesome features comparable to a high end phone. the design is kind of bland for me and its back is really slick, beside that its a great phone!. Rated 5 out of. My last phone was an Aristo 1, this has a an awesome new interface. Really feels like am iPhone X. LG TONE PRO® Bluetooth® Wireless Stereo Headset.

Adrian Diaconescu January 22, 2018 10:53 am. While reportedly restarting the G7’s development from scratch , and exploring various ways to enhance the V30 user experience , LG continues to dole out mid-range smartphones in both Korea and the US, seeking sales volume for a business that badly needs improved profitability .. Following in the footsteps of the first Android Nougat device on MetroPCS , the LG Aristo 2 unfortunately runs the same OS flavor for its launch through T-Mobile’s flagship prepaid brand.. Truth be told, the “all-new” Aristo 2 is not much of an upgrade over the original version, sharing a modest quad-core Snapdragon 425 processor with its predecessor, as well as 13 and 5MP cameras, and a 2,410mAh removable battery.. The first-gen’s 1.5GB RAM count is bumped up to two full gigs, paired with the same 16GB internal storage space and a microSD card slot for up to 32GB more digital hoarding room.. Don’t let the rear-mounted button fool you either, as it still doesn’t appear to support fingerprint authentication. On the bright side, MetroPCS is highlighting facial recognition “security and convenience” as a big selling point, although something tells us the LG Aristo 2 isn’t exactly on par with the iPhone X in the biometrics department.. Still, the 720p 5-incher only costs $59 after a $30 instant discount and $50 mail-in rebate, which should make a fair amount of Metro customers forgive its mediocrity and unoriginality..

LG Aristo 2 leaks, coming to T-Mobile and Metro PCS. The sequel to last year's LG Aristo is coming soon. The retail packaging and the user-manual for the device leaked, revealing the handset's design and key specifications.. The leak reveals the Aristo 2 is powered by Snapdragon 425 SoC and sports a 5.0-inch HD (1280×720) display. It comes with 2GB RAM and 16GB storage, and runs Android 7.1.2 Nougat out of the box. A 2,410mAh removable battery is there to keep the lights on.. No information on the release date, but if January 15 on the device's image (in the leak) is any indication, launch shouldn't be far off. Both T-Mobile and Metro PCS will be carrying it.. LG Aristo announced for T-Mobile and MetroPCS, only $59 on prepaid. Non-functional LG Wallet/Pay app arrives on Google Play. LG V30 drops to $674.99 unlocked, $150 off. LG teases 2018 TV range with built-in Google Assistant. Does the LG Aristo 2 have a fingerprint scanner or not?. Not much of an improvement over the aristo, which isnt a reliable device itself.. It runs the older format because thats how LG does the 5 inch screen phones on Metro and t-mobile. Its not until after the flagship launches that phones like the k20 plus or stylos come out that they release the new software.

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $95 Buy.

Share your thoughts with other customers. There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars Great case for the price!. It fits my LG Aristo perfectly and although the case isn't military grade, it seems to offer decent protection with both the rubber and plastic shell. It does have some bulk to it, but definitely not as much as some cases out there. The case has a sleek and simple design, which I like. It was also extremely easy to put on. I would definitely recommend this case, especially for someone looking for a quality case at a reasonable price.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars I am also very pleased with the feel of the case. Cases sometimes make the volume buttons very hard to use. When placed on the phone with some care, that hasn't happened with this type. I sometimes miss a case that has a front cover, but this does seem to protect the phone from most short drops and other rough handling. I am also very pleased with the feel of the case, hard on the sides and flexible rubber on the top and bottom.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Nice case for cheap. Good quality case for the price...much cheaper than the phone store! I needed the rubberized edges because im always dropping stuff 😣. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Protection for sure!. The fit is perfect! The protection is fantastic! I drop my phone all of the time and the cover protects it so beautifully. I like that it is not super bulky. It does not have a kick stand or anything which is fine with me since I do not use any of that jazz.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars This case has been great, already drop it 4 times at work getting .... This case has been great , already drop it 4 times at work getting on an off equipment, only reason not give it 5 stars because used to having phone clip on my side and it stick from rubber (like it should) getting it out my pocket. I will probably have to get something that clips to side but will use this long as possible as it is everything needs to be and price was best then any where else you will find.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Protects phone well.. Got it for my brother who is a major klutz. He hasn't shattered anything or broken his phone yet. Probably the longest his phone has ever lasted. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Sturdy. I broke my previous phone due to not having a case so I learned my lesson the hard way... My phone fell multiple times with this case and survived every one of them.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect case for LG Risio 2. This is a perfect case for the LG Risio 2 - highly protective, easy to grip, and for a great price. We have 4 Risio 2s in our family, and we've bought 4 of these cases - highly satisfied..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 3.0 out of 5 stars Sturdy Case!. I purchase this case for my husband who is pretty rough with his phones. He is constantly dropping them so I need a sturdy case. I picked this case and he has had it on a week, so far no problems. The only issue is the free screen cover.... I could have done it wrong but it basically stuck for 5 minutes and I ended up taking it off. Comes with a clip for your belt, nice but my husband wont us that. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars its a good deal. clip isnt very strong to stay on belt, and doesnt rotate a full 360 so its kind of only convenient on left side of waist, and im not left handed.. the screen protector is a nice addition; however, it doesnt go to edge of the phone or to the case, and unless you spend a bit of time getting it just right it wont cover all of the screen its cut to fit EXACT. It does seem very durable and strong and will protect it well. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars It's OK. This case appears to be durable enough and will probably stay on the phone after a hard drop, but it is not attached as securely to the phone as other type cases like this. The built-in stand is hard to pull out of the case. Good value for the price, assuming that it can be bought more cheaply than the average case of its type. The Rebel 2 is a fairly cheap phone, so this case is adequate.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars He works construction and it is perfect for his banging around. He works construction and it is perfect for his banging around. The screen protector is more of a film, we will need to buy something that will actually protect, but it is more than worth the short money. Fits perfectly, durable (except for screen sticker) & attractive.. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars The Case alone if very good The Screen Protector alone is good. The Case alone if very good The Screen Protector alone is good. However, the Case pushes on the edge of the Screen Protector, and hence the screen protector then comes off.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars don't know if it will survive the test of my 9 year old but the case feels sturdy and looks really nice. I just got it, don't know if it will survive the test of my 9 year old but the case feels sturdy and looks really nice. The screen protector is not attached to case it one of those that you stick on and it fits slightly smaller than the screen but the case looks great. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars other then that it's great. It's priced lower then what local stores were .... This was almost a 5 star purchase except for one thing. You have to have the screen face inward in order to fit inside the clip on case. Which makes no sense because then how you do use the stand to hold your phone up when you watch videos or movies? other then that it's great. It's priced lower then what local stores were charging and with prime. If I am wrong on the proper use of the clip case I apologize and thank you in advance for your help.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great product would recommend. came with everything but my only problem is on the screen protector I'm not sure if its the right one because the part were I'm suppose to peel off is facing the screen. I have to flip it so the front camera is not being blocked. Im guessing it is the right one but I'm just doubting it. Over all it been a great product. Was this review helpful to you?. Got it for my sons phone - He LOVES IT!. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. It came very fast and everything that was expected.. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. You get what you pay for. If you are careful this item will last. This is my third one of these because the belt clip keeps breaking. 3.0 out of 5 stars You get what you pay for. my screen is still in one piece love it. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars.

How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. LG Aristo 2 on MetroPCS brings Android Nougat to the masses. JC Torres - Jan 23, 2018. How much would it cost you to have an Android phone with a more or less recent version of the mobile OS? If you’re willing to cut corners, apparently not that much. Of course, you will not be getting top of the line specs or features, but if you’re more concerned about the longevity of your phone in terms of software updates, then the LG Aristo 2 might be more to your taste. Arriving almost exactly a year before the first one, the Aristo 2 is probably the cheapest Android Nougat phone you’ll be able to buy from a big brand and a carrier.. Fortunately, it is no Android Go phone, which means you still have some decent mid-range specs packed inside. Though it does run on an aging Snapdragon 425, it does have 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of built-in expandable memory. The 5.0-inch 720p screen does at least boast of in-cell IPS technology. And perhaps surprisingly, it comes with Android 7.1.2 out of the box. A bit rare for low-tier phones.. Despite that, the Aristo 2 does have a set of features that make the phone a lot more interesting. In addition to the Auto Shot and Gesture Shot for the 5 megapixel front camera, there’s a Burst Shot mode for the 13 megapixel PDAF rear shooter when you hold down the shutter button. The phone has some LG-specific features like QuickMemo+ for taking notes on a blank screen using your finger (or a capacitive stylus) and Capture+ for drawing on any screen.. This bundle would normally cost you $139 unlocked, but MetroPCS has quite a deal going on. First is an instant $30 discount followed a $50 mail-in rebate, which practically means it will only cost $59. But if you trade in an old phone when you get an unlimited LTE plan, you can even have the LG Aristo 2 for free.. Topics Android Android Nougat LG metropcs Phones smartphone.

Budget-friendly LG Aristo 2 now official. LG Aristo 2 (Source: LG USA). The Snapdragon 425-powered LG Aristo 2 comes with Android 7.1.2 onboard and only features 2 GB RAM and 16 GB internal storage. However, its price is far below the US$100 mark, so there is not much to complain about.. by Codrut Nistor , 2018/01/23.

Best Notebooks for University Students ». Top Windows alternatives to Apple's MacBook series ». » Tablets , » Windows Tablets » Smartphones. Last year, MetroPCS and T-Mobile introduced the affordable LG Aristo in the US market. Now, it looks like the time has come for its successor already. However, the LG Aristo 2 is no device to knock your socks off, but those looking for a backup handset or just a very affordable Android Nougat smartphone and nothing more could find it to be a tempting choice.. The LG Aristo 2 has a 5-inch IPS touchscreen display with just 1,280 x 720 pixels and uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processor. According to a comment posted on YouTube by a Boost Mobile user, it looks like a MediaTek-powered variant could also available, but we cannot confirm that yet. The other specs are in line with the sub-US$100 price tag: 2 GB RAM, 16 GB internal storage, microSD support up to 32 GB, 5 MP front camera, 13 MP main image shooter, 2,410 mAh battery (removable). The Android 7.1.2 Nougat firmware will probably never get updated to Oreo, but those who buy this handset can only hope for a miracle. After all, hope dies last, right?. In addition to the above, we should also highlight that the LG Aristo 2 is a 4G LTE-capable handset with WiFi calling support and can provide more than 17 hours of talk time on a full charge. MetroPCS currently has the LG Aristo 2 up for sale with a price of just US$59, down from an MSRP of US$139.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write?

Although I have been writing about new software and hardware for almost a decade, I consider myself to be old school. I always enjoy listening to music on CD or tape instead of digital files and I will not even get into the touchscreen vs physical keys debate. However, I also enjoy new technology, as I now have the chance to take a look at the future every day. I joined the Notebookcheck crew back in 2013 and I have no plans to leave the ship anytime soon..
