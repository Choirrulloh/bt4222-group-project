Vodafone Chat 655 - user opinions and reviews. I am using this as secondary phone. You have to press the keys really hard for typing and locking the device. The loudspeaker and call quality is really good,but the main Opera browser doesn't seem to work on WiFi networks. After switching to Flight mode and again going to Normal I managed to get old Facebook app working. J2ME games performance is really poor... only few games were playable in 30FPS with no lag. I would highly recommend getting Nokia Asha 210 or some old Samsung Omnia instead of this one. You can also use this phone as webcam by plugging it into you computer. There is no firmware update tool from Alcatel,but you can find a PC suite which would work with this model.. Good Mobile Phone Vit Good Pasnalti. Good Mobile Phone Vit Good Pasnalti.

Rezolutia reala este 3, 15 MP, nu stiu de ce majoritatea site-urilor dau altceva. Manualul pentru Alcatel-ul- fratior este aici si este mult mai cuprinzator decat manualul pentru Vodafone 655 Chat.. Din manualul Alcatel aflati de exemplu cum puteti instala programe suplimentare. Teoretic telefonul ar trebui sa poata fi folosit pe post de camera WEB, eu nu am reusit acest lucru... Calitatea muzicii in difuzorul propriu este foarte buna, insa volumul nu este foarte mare. Pare un telefon axat pe comunicare, SMS, email, facebook. Nu cred ca este un telefon prea bun pentru jocuri. Autonomia pe 3G este de cam 2 zile, cu utilizare internet, email, facebook..

Trimite prin e-mail către un prieten. da in legatura cu acel manual ...de ce nu se da acelasi manual dar in romana si cand cumpar telefonul???? pai eu cumpar un telefon cu manualul de 3 pagini cand voi ar trebui sa dati consumatorului un manual pe care sa se bazeze. ceea ce faceti voi se numeste escrocherie pe fata. in al doilea rand dati telefoane cu numele similar cu cel al producatorului nokia. care este diferenta intre ele? ar trebui sa specificati care este producatorul telefonului. bateria este alcatel, telefonul este zte. nokia stie ca vindeti telefoane sub acelasi aspect dar facute in china?. se pare ca vodafone si-a pierdut credibilitatea. de curiozitate daca acest telefon se repara odata la 2 luni, ce se intampla cand nu mai am garantie? cineva de la vodafone mi-a spus ca daca telefonul se va strica in continuare, chiar si dupa terminarea garantiei atunci o sa il repare contra cost, iar eu va spun ca daca si a 3 oara se strica eu o sa va fac personal o reclamatia la anpc.. Mesajul 9 din 10. Trimite prin e-mail către un prieten. Manualul in limba romana este disponibil aici .. Referitor la postarea de aici ,. din verificarile efectuate denumirea de Nokia 655 Chat nu exista printre modelele celor de la Nokia .. Vodafone Romania nu este producator de telefoane, iar comercializarea terminalelor sub brand-ul nostru se face pe baza unui parteneriat pe care il avem cu Alcatel, Huawei si ZTE.. In ceea ce priveste garantia, decizia de a repara sau a inlocui terminalul apartine strict de service.. Asa cum ti-am mentionat aici ,. inlocuirea telefonului cu unul nou se poate face numai in cazul in care , in urma unei expertize,. constata defectul si nu pot aduce aparatul la conformitate. I n momentul expirarii garantiei, aparatul se repara contra cost.. Daca doresti, imi poti trimite un mesaj privat care sa contina IMEI-ul telefonului pentru a putea verifica situatia descrisa..
