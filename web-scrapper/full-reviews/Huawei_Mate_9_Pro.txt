I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. Huawei's own Kirin 960 chip is in my opinion the fastest Android chip on the market, better than Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 or 821 (and the benchmarks back this up) or Samsung's Exynos 8890. Huawei's dual-camera tech with Leica branding takes very fun photos that are no possible on any other phone. I've gone in-depth about this in the Mate 9 and P9 review, but I'll explain more later. In terms of pure photo quality, it's not the best camera of the bunch, but it's the most fun. The EMUI software has cleaned up significantly, and the all-black notification/toggle shade is probably the best looking and most intuitive notification shade of any phone I've tried. Little software touches like one-hand mode that's easier to activate than on other phones make using the Mate 9 Pro a joy. Huawei builds the fastest fingerprint sensor on the market bar none. That, along with the fact that Huawei doesn't require you to press a button to activate sensor (instead, it goes to work as soon as your finger touches the sensor) means the phone unlocks at an instantaneous rate. Use a Huawei phone for a few days, then go back to a Samsung or iPhone and the unlocking process feels noticeably slower. The Mate 9 Pro is a very strong media creating and consuming machine. The phone has dual stereo loud speakers -- which is increasingly rare in today's phones -- and has multi-directional mics for enhanced recording.. It is a testament (or perhaps indictment?) to the Wild Wild West nature of the mobile industry that, on December 14, thinking it was close enough to the end of the year, I wrote a piece ranking my favorite smartphones of 2016 -- only for the list to be thrown out of wack a week later when I got my hands on the Huawei Mate 9 Pro.. The Mate 9 Pro is now my favorite go-to phone to use, and. since it was technically released in 2016, that means it is indeed my new favorite phone of 2016.. To be honest, this came as a complete surprise. I knew of the existence of this phone when I wrote that original list -- heck, I had even already got my hands on the "normal" Mate 9, which while excellent didn't blow me away -- and I assumed. the Pro wouldn't differ enough from other Huawei phones to affect the list. And in many ways the differences between the Mate 9 Pro and Mate 9 aren't drastic, but these little bits add up and the whole package is the most pleasant phone experience I've had so far.. I wrote about how the Mate 9, despite its 5.9-inch screen, still felt comfortable in the hand. Well the Pro with a smaller 5.5-inch display, feels even better. my phone to be very usable one-hand, but still come with a bigger screen north of 5.2-inches (yes, I know it's me having my cake and eat it too -- such is the nature of tech geeks), and the Mate 9 Pro comes the closest of any phone since the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (still the greatest balance of "screen size"+"small body" ever) to giving me that.. The Mate 9 Pro also ups its screen resolution to quad HD instead of the normal Mate's 1080p. Now if you've read my stuff you know I don't think there's a huge difference between the two resolutions on mobile screens, and that's still true here. But the Mate 9 Pro's screen is noticeably superior to the normal Mate 9's screen because it's AMOLED instead of LCD. I've placed the two phones side by side , and the true blacks on the Mate 9 Pro is much more aesthetically pleasing.. And then there are the curves. The Mate 9 Pro features a dual-curved display (started by Samsung back in 2015, but almost every Chinese phonemaker have since followed suit in 2016, and Apple will too in 2017) but the curves here are very, very subtle, to the point that it doesn't feel or look like a curved-screen phone unless you examine it closely. Such shallow curves mean the phone doesn't have the same cool effect of visuals. "spilling off the screen" like on the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge , Vivo XPlay 6 (I'm reviewing this next), or the Xiaomi Mi Note 2 , but it also means the phone has almost none of the erroneous palm touch issues that plague the S7 Edge very badly and to a lesser extent, the Mi Note 2.. So the combination of these little things: superior AMOLED display, subtle curves and even more comfortable in-hand feel pushes the Mate 9 Pro above the normal Mate 9. As for what makes it better than other phones I've used? Well here goes:. EMUI's notification shade is very clean, looks cool, and completely customizable (left and center); a look at the various camera modes offered by the Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro (right).. Next page: battery, camera, final thoughts.... 
I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. The Huawei Mate 9 Pro (left) and the Huawei Mate 9. Huawei unveiled its 2016 flagship phablet the Mate 9 on November 3, the Chinese tech. powerhouse also introduced a super luxurious (aka overpriced) variant dubbed the Porsche Design Mate 9. Aside from the gratuitous "luxury sports car" branding, the souped-up version of the phone. is probably mostly notable to the tech world for being eerily similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (or more precisely, the now-dead Note 7), meaning it's got that same dual curved edge display that Samsung first introduced in 2015, and Chinese phonemakers from Xiaomi to Vivo to Gionee have since followed suit.. With the Porsche version of the phone valued at a whopping. $1,600, there was no way I was going to get one, despite my love of Huawei's camera software and dual curved displays. And so when Huawei announced a few weeks later the Mate 9 Pro, which is basically the Porsche Mate 9 without the expensive luxury branding, I jumped and purchased one.. I have already reviewed the standard Mate 9 here , and while that phone is excellent, the Mate 9 Pro is indeed. The most notable difference between the two phones to me and most techies is the screen -- no, I'm not talking about the. resolution bump from the standard Mate 9's 1080p to quad HD, or the curved screen for that matter. The difference I'm talking about is AMOLED vs LCD. uses a LCD panel, while the Pro goes for AMOLED. Many people, including myself, have written about why AMOLED panels are better than LCD displays , and the difference here is clear when the phones are placed side by side. The Mate 9 Pro's "true blacks" make the same image on the standard Mate 9 look sort of grey, with a bit of a glow.. Black backgrounds look much better on the Mate 9 Pro (left) than on the standard Mate 9 because AMOLED display beats LCD. As for the body of the phone: the Mate 9 Pro. makes the curious decision of moving Huawei's regular rear fingerprint sensor to the front (which only makes the device look that much more similar to the S7 Edge/Note 7...) while the standard Mate 9 sticks with Huawei tradition. The dual-lens set-up in the back look almost identical, but the Pro's back is a brushed aluminum while the standard Mate 9's back is more traditional metal.. Also notable is that the Mate 9's top bezel is a lot slimmer than the Pro's top bezel (the bottom bezels are mostly the same sizes), I wonder if this is a design choice done on purpose because Huawei wanted the Pro version of the phone to have a complete symmetrical design -- front and back, top and bottom -- a la the Note 7. The curves on Mate 9 Pro's screen also isn't as drastic as the curves found on the S7 Edge or the Xiaomi Mi Note 2, and Huawei hasn't developed any "edge" software features here (I say for the better, since the Edge features on the Galaxy phones are mostly gimmicks), so these curves are exclusively just for looks and feel.. Notice the top bezel on the Mate 9 (right) is a lot smaller than on the Mate 9 Pro.. The Huawei Mate 9 Pro's (center) curves aren't as noticeable at the ones on the S7 Edge (left) and Xiaomi Mi Note 2 (right). I'll be back with a full review, as well as a "curved display phone showdown" between the Mate 9 Pro, Xiaomi Mi Note 2, and the Galaxy S7 Edge..

Unlike the standard Mate 9 that sports a 5.9-inch full HD (1080p) display, the Pro version comes with a smaller 5.5-inch dual edge curved display that supports a better Quad HD (2560 x 1440 pixels) resolution. Furthermore, the fingerprint sensor on the back of the regular Mate 9 has been moved to the front in the Mate 9 Pro model. The rest of the phone's specs remain the same, including the Kirin 960 chipset, dual-camera setup, amount of RAM and battery size (4,000 mAh). However, the Mate 9 Pro will cost slightly more than the standard model.. OS: Android (8.0, 7.0), Huawei Emotion UI. Dimensions: 5.98 x 2.95 x 0.30 inches (152 x 75 x 7.5 mm).

The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Dual-camera (20-megapixel, F2.2 aperture), Optical image stabilization, Autofocus (Laser, Phase detection), CMOS image sensor, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI).

The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Octa-core, 2400 MHz, ARM Cortex-A73 and ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

Huawei Android Dual SIM Time-saver. If you remember, Huawei announced the Mate 9 Porsche Design along with the regular Mate 9. It used the same hardware except for the screen, which was AMOLED and a curved one at that. It was also prohibitively expensive, and it was only going to be sold through Porsche Design exclusive boutiques. It set off a gadget craving that the regular Mate 9 could not fulfill.. Fast forward a couple of months, and we now hold the Mate 9 Pro in our hands - a smartphone identical to the Porsche Design Edition and a cheaper one, too. Sure, the Mate 9 Pro is not as widely available as the Mate 9, but at least it's not a designer product with an obscene price tag attached to it.. First, let's check the at-a-glance list of Huawei Mate 9 Pro's main strong points.. The Huawei-Leica partnership continues with the Pro flavor, too. The setup is the same as on the regular Mate 9 - a 20MP/12MP dual-camera setup featuring OIS and 4-in-1 autofocus.. The reduced screen size is probably the single potential turn off for the aspiring owners. The downsizing was enough to demote the Mate 9 from a phablet to a regular sized smartphone by current standards. On the other hand, it's a change that you may be more than happy with if the Mate 9 was too big for you.. The lack of memory expansion is easily offset by the default 128GB internal storage, while the lack of waterproofing is hardly a surprise as Huawei hasn't introduced it on any of its products.. The Huawei Mate 9 Pro was envisioned as a premium product, and you can tell by the involvement of Porsche Design. But even losing the pricey logos, the superior design and appearance are easy to spot.. The curved front glass is an immediate attention grabber. The Galaxy S6 edge originally established the double-edge design, and it was successfully continued as a trend by the Galaxy S7 edge. Huawei's intent to be edgy might have gone a bit too far, though, as the Mate 9 Pro looks are a bit too S7 edge-y, pun intended.. The Huawei Mate 9 Pro may not be unique, but that's true for almost any phone these days. It's the build quality and sturdiness that matter the most and the Mate 9 Pro has got them just right. The curved glass fits perfectly into the metal shell, and there are no gaps whatsoever. Handling the Mate 9 Pro is a premium experience by our book, though all these curves hardly help with the handling.. The Huawei Mate 9 Pro measures 152 x 75 x 7.5mm, which is about right for a 5.5-incher and it's very close to the Galaxy S7 edge's measurements. As expected, the Mate 9 Pro is smaller than the Mate 9, and also lighter, but it's 12g heavier than the Galaxy S7 edge.. The Huawei Mate 9 Pro has a lot to show on the surface - there is an IR blaster on the top. On the left, you can find the dual-SIM slot, no memory expansion, sorry. At the bottom is the primary speaker, while the earpiece doubles as a secondary speaker and thus creating a stereo effect.. The Home key is really special, though. For starters, it is not clickable; it reacts to taps only. It also has an embedded fingerprint scanner, which has one of the fastest and most accurate sensors we've encountered to date. Oh, and it's always-on so you can wake the phone from standby just by touching it.. The Home key surprises continued once we dug into the Settings menu. You can opt to disable the other two cleverly hidden, though backlighted capacitive keys, and make the Home key a multi-functional tool - one tap for Back, long tap for Home, and swipe left or right on its surface for Task Switcher. It's like Meizu's mTouch key, but even better.. Design and build quality score. The 5.5" curved AMOLED screen is the Huawei Mate 9 Pro's centerpiece. It's .4" smaller than the Mate 9's, but has a higher 1440p resolution and thus much higher pixel density of 534ppi.. The Mate 9's 5.9" screen posted flagship-worthy scores across our display tests - brightness, contrast, sunlight legibility. The contrast is as good as an AMOLED screen can offer and the brightness, at 366nits, stays around the average numbers for this type of displays.. The color accuracy was the only average result, but it didn't ruin the positive impressions we got.. A definite positive point is that the minimum level of brightness is only 4 nits, which would make for a comfortable reading experience in dark environments.. The Huawei Mate 9 Pro may be smaller than the Mate 9, but its battery capacity didn't take a hit. It's still a 4,000mAh unit, and it's still one of the most generous offerings in the premium segment.. The device ships with a beefy charger capable of outputting 5V/4.5A, 4.5V/5A, and 5V/2A. The Mate 9 Pro battery charges ridiculously fast when you use the supplied adapter and cable. Only 10 minutes worth of charging will get you from 2% (that's the lowest point before the device powers off) to 20%. Another 20min of charging and you're looking at 55%, while 95% is achieved 75min after plugging it in.. Generally, the Mate 9 Pro's battery life is excellent and aced all of our battery tests.. The Huawei Mate 9 Pro outputs solid audio performance. When plugged into an active external amplifier, it posted excellent scores top to bottom, hinting at perfectly accurate audio reproduction. Its loudness was even higher than the Mate 9's.. Volume remained great even when we plugged in our headphones but the rest of the indicators suffered a bit. It's still a decent showing, but not as clear as the vanilla Mate 9.. We got an excellent loudspeaker loudness we got from the Mate 9 Pro, just as we did with the Mate 9. The Mate 9 Pro posted very high numbers in all three of our tests, securing an Excellent mark. Not only that, but it sounded clear and distortion free even at maximum volume.. The Mate 9 Pro, just like the Mate 9, actually has stereo speakers, sort of. The earpiece doubles as left channel, when the phone is held in landscape, and it does create a stereo effect even though the earpiece is quieter than the main speaker. When in portrait, there is no such channel separation, and instead, the earpiece is used as a tweeter, while the main speaker outputs the mid and low frequencies.. The second collaboration with Leica has brought the Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro a dual camera setup, which consists of a 20MP monochrome sensor and a 12MP RGB one, each of these behind its own 27mm-equiv. The cameras are optically stabilized - evidently both of them because otherwise, the two images wouldn't properly align. So we have 20MP and 12MP - the resolutions don't match, but engineers have come up with an ingenious solution of how to use them.. When you're shooting color, the Mate 9 Pro blends the input from the monochrome camera with the one from the color camera with the goal being, you guessed it, to produce better images. The high-res 20MP monochrome camera records luminance data, which is where Huawei claims most of the fine detail is, while the lower-res 12MP camera provides the color to go with the detail. You can capture either 20MP or 12MP color photos.. That f/2.2 aperture is not as wide as on other premium smartphones, but Huawei argues that since you have two cameras, they capture double the light.. As for the image quality, detail is abundant without any oversharpening and textures are rendered in a very natural way.. The Mate 9 Pro's black and white images are contrasty and pleasant looking, but the monochrome camera is more of a specialty tool, and unless you love monochrome photography particularly, you are unlikely to use it all that often on its own.. 12MP color samples  20MP color samples  20MP monochrome samples. Thanks to the depth information the Mate 9 Pro can gather from its two cameras, it can try and reproduce the blurred background of a proper portrait lens. The feature is accessed from the Wide aperture mode toggle and lets you simulate apertures from f/0.95 to f/16.. F/0.95 sample  F/4.0 sample  F/6.3 sample. The Mate 9 Pro does an admirable job with low-light settings, preserving detail and, to a certain extent, color. But only if you shoot close-ups as was the case with our Picture Compare Tests. If you are going after landscape samples, the dusk photos are fine, but the night images quite often lack sharpness due to either focusing issues or camera shake even though the Mate 9 Pro is equipped with plenty of tools to help it get them right.. Among those tools is the Light painting mode, which includes four sub-modes: Car light trails, Light graffiti, Silky Water and Star track.. 12MP dusk sample  12MP night sample  12MP tripod sample, 4s  Light Painting - Car Trails, 34.3s. The Mate 9 Pro's front-facing camera is an 8MP f/1.9 shooter with autofocus. It produces great results in daylight with plenty of detail and pleasing colors, and also quite good dynamic range. On occasion, the Mate 9 Pro's selfie cam may choose to focus on the background instead of your face, so it's worth keeping an eye on the final images.. There's a beautification feature that, when dialed up to the extreme, does a remarkably cartoonish and overexposed rendering of reality with oversaturated colors and smeared details.. Normal selfie  Beauty level 5  Beauty level 10. The Huawei Mate 9 Pro encodes its 4K videos using the H.265 codec. It allows for a lower filesize at roughly the same quality, but H.265 is still a rarely used codec and doesn't work for YouTube. 1080p videos use the more standard H.264 compression, so they're YouTube-friendly.. 4K videos are sharp and detailed and exhibit good contrast and pleasing colors - the video output is punchier than how reality looks like.. The Huawei Mate 9 Pro runs on the latest Android 7.0 Nougat. As usual, you get a healthy dose of Huawei customizations behind the EmotionUI name or EMUI. The proprietary overlay is a brand-new version 5.0, which reuses a lot from previous iterations but also introduces a few changes.. First, you can set up a Private space, which you can access with a different fingerprint. The data stored there is independently encrypted, and Huawei says it's inaccessible to the other users. Sadly, you can have only one Private space per device.. In addition to that you can have two app instances for some social apps so you can access two accounts simultaneously.. The notification area is a 50/50 mix between stock Nougat and Emotion 5.0. Huawei has tweaked the look of the quick toggles and added the auto-brightness switch, which Google so stubbornly refuses to keep in plain sight.. Throughout the interface you get contextual menus with relevant options right at the bottom of the screen above the navigation bar - hugely convenient for single-handed operation. The universal drawer that pulls out from the left side of Google apps is a lot better suited for left-hand use than right-hand, and even for lefties some of the higher-placed options are still too far away.. The UI is completely themeable too.. Finally, there are various advanced features - multi-window, motion and voice control, flip and knuckle gestures, among others.. The Huawei Mate 9 Pro is powered by the Kirin 960 SoC, developed by the in-house chipmaker HiSilicon. The main processor within the chipset consists of a quad-core Cortex-A73 cluster clocked at 2.4GHz, plus a quad-core array of the less-powerful Cortex-A53 cores ticking at 1.8GHz. The Cortex-A73s boast a 30% power efficiency compared to the previous A72 design, while also promising improved performance.. The new Mali-G71 GPU can't shine because of the higher QHD resolution. It was great for the Mate 9's 1080p screen, but it isn't acing any GPU tests on the Pro model. In some of our tests it didn't outrun the competition as expected, but in applications that can benefit from the Vulkan graphics API support, it's a great performer.. Huawei Mate 9 Pro has the fastest processor around, while its graphics skills are very good, though fall short of the excellent mark. The Mate 9 Pro is a pure-bred flagship with stutter-free performance and great multi-tasking potential thanks to those six gigs of RAM. The benchmarks show it is a great all-round performer and we only have overwhelmingly positive real-life impressions.. Huawei Mate 9 Pro is a wonderful conclusion to the Mate 9 series, meeting the market's demand for a premium twist on all recent flagships. The sole existence of the Mate 9 Pro leaves room for the original Mate 9 popularity to grow and thus sell better by being the more affordable and mainstream model, without giving up on any important features.. There is also another good reason for the Mate 9 Pro existence - it gives you the opportunity to own the Porsche Design edition without actually paying double for the premium Porsche Design logos. And the new dual-curved AMOLED screen, the completely different design, and the increased memory are worth the extra $100 over the original Mate 9.. Its AMOLED screen may not be Samsung-grade in color accuracy and sunlight legibility, but it does surpass most of the current crop of flagships. And the GPU may not be acing the tests, but the processor is top of the line. The rest is quite on par - a memorable design, an amazing camera experience with a great creative potential, a superb battery life, loud stereo speakers, and the pleasant Emotion UI.. The real head-turner remains the camera. Episode 2 of the Huawei-Leica collaboration brings a higher resolution 20MP monochrome shooter to accompany the 12MP regular RGB one. The two also work in unison to deliver 20MP color shots (almost as good), but stick to 12MP color or 20MP B&W, and you won't be disappointed.. Solid battery life across all tests. Class-leading CPU performance, enough GPU punch. Great camera skills and quality, ready for creative photography. The display could have been brighter. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus is one of the best large-screen phones around. It has got a somewhat similar in size 5.5" LCD screen - one of the best around. The photos from the 7 Plus are inferior in detail but the second camera creates excellent portrait shots with great-looking software-generated bokeh. The iPhone has the best mobile processor on the market, great stereo speakers and is finally waterproof. Its battery life is inferior to the Huawei Mate 9 Pro - but even with iOS at the wheel, 2900mAh worth of battery capacity can only get you so far.. The Galaxy S7 edge has similar design and specs but is also water-tight, can easily tip the scales in S7's favor. It may not have the Leica tools, but its camera is nothing short of impressive nevertheless (especially its class-leading focus). The S7 edge is also cheaper and will get even better deals once the S8 premieres in a few weeks.. We consider the OnePlus 3T as one of the best phones to buy at any price, but it helps that it's very reasonably priced. It has a great camera, a better GPU, and is among the fastest phones we've used - if not the fastest. Huawei has it beat on screen resolution and camera skills.. The Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus has a 5.7-inch 1080p LCD display and a Snapdragon 821 SoC, which make it faster than the Mate 9 Pro, though the faceplate is less attractive. Xiaomi has pretty much borrowed the Huawei/Leica's idea from the P9 and offers a dual 13MP camera with one color and one monochrome sensor. It lacks OIS, and Leica's exclusive processing, but if you fancy something similar and less expensive, the Mi 5s Plus may turn out to be the right phone for you after all.. The Huawei Mate 9 Pro is a fancy device that leaves a lasting positive impression, and easily likable either because of its design, screen, performance, or camera. The only thing stopping the Mate 9 Pro of being a best-seller is the limited availability, which is probably due to the imminent P10 launch. Its fate will be sealed at the upcoming MWC - either overshadowed by the P10 or standing out in spite of it..

Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running..

Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better!

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $525 Buy. $629 Buy.

Huawei is set to announce its next flagship line, believed to be called the Mate 9, in November. Reports have indicated the Mate 9 will come in both standard and dual-edge curved variants.. | October 24, 2016 -- 17:12 GMT (01:12 GMT+08:00). Alleged press image of the Huawei Mate 9 Pro with a dual-edge curved screen. Huawei Mate 9 colors (Image: EvLeaks/VentureBeat). Galaxy Note 7 replacement? Apple car plans hit snag as 'dozens' of employees laid off: Report GoPro poaches top Apple designer to head new design group Apple hires former Tesla VP for 'special projects': Report Google plans two Android Wear smartwatches with Google Assistant Gallery: Daydream View is Google's first VR headset. China tech giant Huawei is set to release its next flagship smartphone line, believed to be called the Mate 9, at its event in Munich, Germany on Nov. In typical smartphone fashion these days, the details for the Mate 9 line are pouring in prior to the event.. Huawei is believed to offer two versions of the smartphone : a standard Mate 9 and dual-edge curved Mate 9 Pro.. The Mate 9 is believed to be similar to the Mate 8 released in late 2015 , with upgraded specifications and sharper design.. EvLeaks of VentureBeat published alleged press images of the Mate 9 in a tweet. The images of the Mate 9 show the handset will feature a dual-lens Leica Summarit H 1:2.2/27 ASPH camera, USB-C port, and fingerprint scanner on the rear of the handset.. The dual-lens, dual-sensor camera is similar to what was featured on the Huawei P9 released in the first half of 2016, though with better capabilities.. Unconfirmed leaks have tipped the Mate 9 as having a 5.9-inch qHD display, a 64-bit, eight-core HiSilicon Kirin 960 system-on-a-chip, 6GB of RAM, and 256GB storage capacity when the handset is fully-spec'd.. A Weibo leak pointed to the Mate 9 becoming available in the following colors: Amber Gold, Ceramic White, Amber Grey, Rose Gold, Moonlight Silver, Sky Grey, Mocha Gold, Champagne Gold, and Enamel Gloss Black.. Pricing and availability for the Mate 9 is not clear.. Likely to take on Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge and the market left open by the Note 7, Huawei will release an upgraded version of the Mate 9 under the "Pro" moniker.. The Mate 9 Pro, codenamed Long Island within Huawei, is believed to feature a dual-edge curved 5.9-inch display and step up to a 1440x2560 qHD resolution from the Mate 9's standard 1080 full-HD resolution, according to VentureBeat.. Reports have circulated the Mate 9 Pro will only be available in the China market. EvLeaks tweeted it will be available for $1,300 fully-spec'd out.. The added resolution of the more expensive Mate 9 Pro is believed to give it support for Google Daydream VR.. Announced at Google I/O 2016 in May, Daydream VR is Google's upcoming line of supported "Daydream ready" smartphones, a headset, a controller, and a whole range of apps and experiences accessible through Google Play.. Rumors have pointed to the Mate 9 lineup running Android 7.0 Nougat, bringing support for Google's VR platform. It's likely Huawei will throw in its own software twists on Nougat.. VentureBeat reported the Mate 9 Pro will be the only Mate 9 to feature support for VR. Huawei previously unveiled a VR headset alongside the Huawei P9 in 2015.. The Mate 9 comes at an opportune time for Huawei. It has a chance to pick up the millions of customers left turning in their Galaxy Note 7 phones in fear they could explode amidst a global recall .. The Galaxy Note 7 was a well-regarded product when first reviewed in August. Could the Huawei Mate 9's specifications and curved screen in the premium model be enough to fill Samsung's shoes?.

Huawei Mate 9 Pro is a Porsche Design Mate 9 without the Porsche branding. No word on any release outside of China for now.. Huawei has announced a third variant of its new Mate 9 for its home market of China, following the announcement of the regular Mate 9 and its pricey Porsche Design-branded sibling. As Gizchina reports, the Huawei Mate 9 Pro is basically a Porsche Design Mate 9 without the Porsche branding and sleek black paint job. And there are a few internal hardware tweaks, too.. The "Pro" features the same 5.5-inch curved Quad HD AMOLED display used in the Porsche Design Mate 9, and the same Kirin 960 processor, 4,000mAh battery and 20MP+12MP Leica camera setup. However there are two new storage and RAM configurations for the Mate 9 Pro. The cheapest 4GB + 64GB version will sell for 4699 yuan ($685), while the higher-end 6GB + 128GB version goes for 5299 yuan ($773). For now, the ludicrous 6GB + 256GB config remains exclusive to the Porsche Design Mate 9.. The Huawei Mate 9 Pro is already on sale in China, where it's available in gold, grey and pink, however there's no word on any plans to launch the device elsewhere. An official statement from Huawei reads:. The Mate 9 Pro was announced on Monday, November 14th at Huawei's press conference held in Shanghai. We're very excited to further expand the Mate series and provide people with a choice of devices that meet their needs. The Mate 9 Pro delivers the performance and experience consumers are looking for, while offering a unique and exciting design. More information about the device's availability will be available soon.. Regardless, European buyers always have the option of stumping up €1395 for the Porsche Design Mate 9 when it goes on sale in December — if they really, really want a curved-screen phone with the latest Huawei tech.. Would you buy the Huawei Mate 9 Pro if it went on sale in Europe or the U.S.? Hit the comments and let us know!. Where to buy the Mate 9 in the U.S. Join the discussion in the forums.

The surprise doesn't end there as well. Despite being named as a "Pro" model, the Mate 9 Pro is actually much smaller than the standard Mate 9. Unlike the Standard model's phablet size 5.9-inch flat display, the Pro version comes in with a Quad HD 5.5-inch curved display (2560 x 1440 pixels). The home button on the Mate 9 Pro doubles as a fingerprint scanner whereas the standard version's fingerprint sensor is positioned in the back. Aside from a better, smaller, curved display and a re-positioned fingerprint scanner, the Mate 9 Pro comes with the same offerings as of the standard version Mate 9.. The Mate 9 Pro is priced at USD 685 (around PHP 33,904 ) for the 4GB RAM/64GB ROM model and USD 775 (around PHP 38,357) for the 6GB RAM / 128GB ROM model.. Sadly, Huawei didn't mentioned whether or not the Mate 9 Pro will be available to other markets outside China.. Reviews of HUAWEI Mate 9 Pro. Will you be the first reviewer of this product?

How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. Huawei Mate 9 price and “9 Pro” release. Chris Burns - Nov 3, 2016. This morning the folks at Huawei showed off their new Huawei Mate 9 and Huawei Mate 9 Pro. Both devices have Huawei aimed at taking on the large smartphone crowd, rolling in two editions for the average and the super-posh. These devices come at a time perfect to take on the lack of a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 product in the wild, and just after the first iPhone 7 Plus rush.. The lesser of the two devices is the Mate 9, a device with a 5.9-inch full HD display, a dual-camera system at its back, and a Kirin 960 processor inside. This device works with USB-C, has 4GB of RAM, and carries its own fingerprint sensor. What’s most important about this device at this point in time to us is the fact that it’ll be in the USA at some point in the future.. The strangest part of this release is the two tiers of high-end. The lesser of the two has a full HD display while the higher-end has a 2K display. The higher-end model’s display is also quite similar to what’s found on the Samsung Galaxy Note / Edge device collection – curved at the edges.. The higher-end version of the Huawei Mate 9 has Porsche branding, named Porsche Design Mate 9. If you’re in the market for a device that’s extremely similar to the Note 7, without a stylus but with Porsche branding, you’re in luck. This version of the device will cost users around €1,395 ($1,549 USD.). The standard edition will cost users $776 and will be launching first in several Asian and Europe-based markets. A USA-based release will take place in the near future, but we do not yet know when.. Huawei Fit hands-on: A fitness watch to undercut Fitbit.
