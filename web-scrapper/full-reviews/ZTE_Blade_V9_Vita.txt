ZTE Blade V9 and V9 Vita are here, we go hands-on. by David Imel 19 hours ago. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. ZTE released the Blade V8 about a year ago, bringing dual-cameras and an octa-core processor to its mid-range line of devices. While these phones won’t have customers rushing to pre-order, they provide quite a bit of value for the price.. This year, ZTE is looking to up the quality of this line even further, producing what it thinks is the best Blade device yet. The new Blade V9 has a similar general shape to last year’s model, but the quality of the build has improved substantially. ZTE is employing a new shimmering material they call “Aurora Glass” to give the V9 a premium look and feel. The Vita doesn’t get this same treatment, but its unibody shell feels similar to the OnePlus 5, which is not at all a bad thing.. Both devices are getting much better screen-to-body ratios this year. The Blade V9 screen takes up 84 percent of the phone and the Vita’s takes up 81 percent. These screens are fairly decent for devices in this price range. Both are Full HD quality, which isn’t incredibly high for a smartphone, but also looks perfectly fine. We wouldn’t discount them just because they didn’t have 1,440p displays.. The Blade V9 and V9 Vita's software feels like the software on the Google Pixel. Both devices run Android Oreo, with a new skin ZTE is calling “Stock Plus.” This name is quite fitting. It feels essentially like stock Android on a Google Pixel. You can always throw your launcher of choice on this device to get a specific feel, but these devices honestly felt just fine with the stock launcher, which is rare with midrange devices.. The Blade V9’s 3-4 GB of RAM and 32-64 GB of storage, but the Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 is the spec that unveils this is really a budget device. This won’t hold up well compared to newer Snapdragon chips on the market today, but for someone that cares more about design and uses their device for simple tasks, the Blade V9 should hold up just fine.. The V9 Vita is more obviously mid-ranged. It’s sporting 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of storage along with a Snapdragon 435 Mobile Processor, showing it was obviously made for the ultra-budget users in mind. This phone will more than likely make its way to Cricket Wireless or a similar carrier under a different name, so it makes sense have have more basic specs inside.. Both devices have a 13 MP dual camera, 3,100 mAh battery, microSD compatibility, a 3.5 mm headphone jack and charging via microUSB, so there really isn’t a whole lot to differentiate these devices on the outside. Internal power and build quality is what really sets the Blade V9 and V9 Vita apart, along with their respective price points.. The face unlock feature seemed fairly reliable in our hands-on time, but we always worry about the security of these things.. Both phones are getting a new face-unlock feature as well. In our hands-on time with the device this seemed fairly reliable, but we always worry about the security of these things. We would likely recommend using the included fingerprint reader instead, but face unlock is always nice to have either way.. 8 MP front-facing camera (up to 13 MP interpolated), while the V9 Vita sports a 5 MP front-facing camera (up to 8 MP interpolated).. ZTE has not announced pricing or availability for the Blade V9 or V9 Vita, but we’ll be sure to update you when we know more.. Do either of these phones sound appealing to you? ZTE has definitely stepped up their build-quality since the last Blade, so it’s good to see consistent improvement.. Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below..

ZTE Blade V9 and Blade V9 VITA hands-on. ZTE Android MWC 2018. It's a dog-eat-dog world on the 2018 mid-ranger scene and like most of it's competitors, ZTE is really trying hard to compete and stay relevant. To that end, the Blade V9 is a good value offer, even if not particularly distinctive.. Build-wise, the 5.7-inch device feels surprisingly light in the hand. Still, ZTE boasts a metal frame as the core of the chassis, with glass wrapping around it on both sides.. There was no mention of Gorilla Glass or any other increased protection finish during the presentation, so we can't really judge on durability quite yet. Still, ZTE is particularly proud of it eight layer design for the back and with good reason. The surface provides a pretty light show. Provided you can keep your fingerprints off it for long enough to actually enjoy it.. Anyway, the LCD panels panels in both the regular V9 and the V9 VITA were surprisingly impressive. Apparently, these come courtesy of LG and upon preliminary observation offer great angles and get super bright. Of course, we can't exactly quantify any of these claims prior to the review, but the Google Pixel 2 XL, which we had handy, couldn't shine nearly as bright as the ZTE pair.. Both ZTE phones get the trendy new 18:9 aspect ratio, which definitely makes them more relevant on the 2018 scene and makes for a better value proposition.. Picture clarity and sharpness looked good on both the V9 and V9 VITA, even though the latter has a native HD+ resolution, while its bigger sibling has FullHD+ to work with. While on the subject of differences, the V9 VITA is not only smaller in overall size, but also plastic all around. Some of its colors also offer a slight sandstone feel, like the Dark Blue one. It also comes in a subtle Pink shade, although you can't really tell from the photos, thanks to ZTE's horrible choice of lighting. In contrast, the Black, Gold, Blue and Gray variants of the regular Blade V9 all come with the same smooth glass finish.. Of course, the pair also differs slightly in internals and in the camera department. Although, again, we can only say by how much with certainty once we get them in the office for review. One thing that did stand out, UX-wise, however, is the very Vanilla-like Android experience on both phones. ZTE seems to be loading in ROMs very close to stock, with barely any bloat and skinning on top.. In fact, we would even go as far as to liken the experience to than on one of Google's own Pixel phones. You get mostly the same minimal default app package. Even the swipe up gesture to enter the app drawer is there. Hopefully this minimalistic approach enabled better and longer software support for the Blade V9 and V9 VITA.. Perhaps the most persuasive aspect of the Blade V9 and Blade V9 Vita, though, is their pretty competitive pricing. You can expect to see them retail starting at $300 and $250, respectively..

ZTE on Sunday added a pair of smartphones to its Blade portfolio of devices. The Blade V9, and its counterpart, the Blade V9 Vita, are mid-range hardware but in a more current design that’s more in line with other 2018 handsets.. The pair of phones run Android 8.0 Oreo and share a number of basic specifications with each other. Each has an 18:9 aspect ratio for the display, dual rear cameras, 3.5mm headphone jacks, microUSB, memory card slot, and the usual fare of connectivity.. With a 5.7-inch display at 2160 x 1080 pixel resolution, the Blade V9 has an aluminum frame with glass panels on both the front and back.. The phone is powered by an octa-core processor and comes in two builds: 2GB RAM with 16GB storage, 4GB RAM with 64GB storage.. In terms of cameras, the Blade V9 has a rear combo of 16-megapixel and 5-megapixel shooters; around front is a either an 8-megapixel or 13-megapixel camera.. According to ZTE, the cameras boast improved low-light performance and the dual-lens cameras offer better bokeh and portrait images.. The front camera supports Faceb detection for unlocking and waking. Other stand-key specs include NFC, fingerprint reader, and a 3,100mAh battery.. Slightly smaller with a 5.45-inch display, the variant has a 1440x x720 pixel resolution. Internally we find a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor with 2GB RAM and 16GB storage.. Rather than glass and aluminum, the Blade V9 Vita employs polycarbonate for its shell. The back offers up a 13-megapixel and 2-megapixel dual camera configuration; the front has an 8-megapixel selfie camera. In terms of battery, the Blade V9 Vita includes a 3,200mAh power source.. The Blade V9 will be sold in black and gold options; the Blade V9 Vita will sell in black, blue, dark blue, and pink. ZTE hasn’t said that either of these phones will come to the United States any time soon but they could arrive under different names. Cricket and MetroPCS would be two likely candidates to offer the Blade V9s.. TAGS blade v9 blade v9 vita MWC2018 zte zte blade zte blade v9 zte blade v9 vita.

https:/ / www.phonescoop.com/ articles/ article.php? a=20227. Hands On with the ZTE Blade V9 and V9 Vita. The latest in ZTE's Blade series phones are the V9 and V9 Vita. These devices bring ZTE's design language in line with current trends by adopting 18:9 displays. They also put the competition on notice with dual cameras designed to take better low-light photographs. Here is Phone Scoop's first look at the latest from ZTE.. The Blade V9 is a huge step forward for the company's mid-range line of devices. Where the Axon brand continues to serve as ZTE's premium line, the Blade V brand fills in the middle somewhere above the Blade A and Blade L series. The Blade V9 and V9 Vita are a step above what we've seen from ZTE in the past, particularly at these price points.. V9 vita / Pixel / V9. V9 vita / Pixel / V9. The Blade V9 sees ZTE showing off design chops we didn't know it had. This handset ditches the plastic materials of ZTE's XMax and ZMax series for an aluminum chassis and glass panels front and back. The metal frame has a matte finish and semi-angled edges that help it feel better against your skin. The 2.5D curved glass panels that sandwich the metal frame are excellent, though this means the phone is more prone to breakage. ZTE didn't say if the glass is Gorilla or Dragontrail. The phone comes in back or gold. A shimmer effect gives the glass some depth. Both colors have some measure of appeal.. Thanks to the 18:9 screen, the V9 has that elongated look common to such phones. I like the size a lot. The 5.7-inch screen means it isn't completely oversized, like some of ZTE's other phones are. In fact, it's close in size/shape the Galaxy S8 and will be a breeze for most people to carry around and use.. The full HD+ (2,160 by 1,080 pixels) screen looks fine. In the few moments I spent with the phone I though it came off looking pretty good. The panel is bright, and the resolution works well considering the size. The glass itself was prone to collecting prints. There are no hardware buttons on front, as all the controls have moved to the screen-based user interface.. I don't think anyone can complain about the build quality. ZTE selected fine materials and assembled the major components tightly. I didn't see any gaps or unsightly seams in the phone's construction.. The phone has a fairly typical set of hardware controls. The screen lock button and volume toggled are on the right edge. It's a cinch to find and use these buttons, and travel and feedback was pretty good. A microUSB port is tucked into the bottom, while a 3.5mm headphone jack is on top. The left edge is smooth metal.. The dual camera module is tucked into the far upper-left corner. ZTE added a fingerprint reader to the rear panel and dropped it right where your finger expects to find it.. ZTE has dropped much of its own UI trickery and loaded the Blade V9 with stock Android — albeit Android 7 Nougat (what the what?!?) The stock build is really nice to see and it means the phone ran smoothly while we looked at it.. If there's one area ZTE paid particular attention, it's the camera. ZTE overhauled its camera app so it is much simpler to use. You've got new modes that are reached easily by swiping, and newly surfaced controls that make altering important settings, such as HDR, from the viewfinder. ZTE paid particular attention to its bokeh feature, which doubles a bit as a portrait mode. ZTE is keeping up with the times and tossed in some new ARS stickers, as well, so you can add silly faces or dinosaurs to your images. Perhaps most importantly, ZTE says the secondary lens will also dramatically help with low-light photography. (After all, we all want those late-night, at-the-bar-with-our-friends pix to turnout well.). As for the hardware, the main lens is a 16-megapixel shooter and the supporting lens is a 5-megapixel shooter. The phone will come with either a 8- or 13-megapixel camera on front, depending on the market.. Wrapping up, it's nice to see features like face unlock, NFC, and a large battery. ZTE says the Blade V9 will cost less than $300. We hope to see a variant of it later in the year.. The V9 Vita, by way of comparison, is not nearly as impressive. It looks similar to the V9, but is smaller and made of plastic. The 18:9 screen gives it that elongated appearance and a hard shell wraps around the rear and side edges. With no metal and no glass, it feels much less expensive and fine. This isn't to say that the V9 Vita is a poor-man's phone. The shape is still elegant and clean.. The smaller screen and slim shape mean it will be comfortable to hold and use, even for those with small hands. I do like the smooth feel of the plastic.. On the front you'll find 2.5D arc curved glass and it is matched perfectly to the plastic shell. The 5.45-inch display drops to HD+ resolution, or 1,440 by 720 pixels. I thought it looked decent in our time with it, and yet it didn't blow me away. It is certainly bright and colorful, even if the resolution isn't quite where I want it to be. There are no buttons on front, as, like the larger V9, all the controls tools have been moved to the user interface.. The button configuration is also just like that of the V9. The screen lock button and volume toggle are both on the right. They are easy enough to find, though I wasn't impressed by travel and feedback. ZTE kept a headphone jack on top and the microUSB port on the bottom. The left edge is free of controls or buttons.. Unlike the V9, the rear panel of the V9 Vita is removable. That means you have to peel the plastic shell off in order to access the SIM or memory card slots.. The rear of the phone looks almost identical to the V9 with the dual camera perched in the upper left corner and the fingerprint reader closer to the middle.. This phone has the same user interface and camera as the V9, and that's a plus. The dual rear camera system includes a 13-/2-megapixel configuration, with an 8-megapixel shooter on front.. ZTE said the price point will fall under $200. Again, this exact phone isn't slated for the U.S., but we hope to see a variant of it arrive later in the year.. ZTE Debuts Blade V9 and V9 Vita with 18:9 Screens. ZTE today expanded its lineup of Blade series handsets with the Blade V9 and V9 Vita. These mid-range handsets bring the Blade series up-to-date with competing designs by adopting the 18:9 aspect ratio display.. Hands On with the ZTE Blade V8 Pro. The V8 Pro is ZTE's latest attempt to bring U.S. consumers more bang for their buck.. Review: ZTE Blade Z Max for MetroPCS. Looking for the biggest possible screen on the least expensive smartphone? The Blade Z Max may be what you seek, thanks to its IMAX-sized display, insane battery, dual cameras, and affordable price point.. Review: ZTE Blade X MAX for Cricket Wireless.

If you need hardcore protection with a little bit of flexibility throughout the day, the Presidio Ultra is an interesting entry.. Review: ZTE Avid 4 for MetroPCS. ZTE's latest low-cost handset for MetroPCS offers entry-level specs and performance. It includes a 5-inch screen, 8-megapixel camera, and Android 7 Nougat. MetroPCS customers can score this handset for next to nothing, but there might be better options. Here is Phone Scoop's in-depth review.. Hands On with the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+.

ZTE launches Blade V9 and Blade V9 Vita at MWC 2018. The ZTE Blade V9 was first made known to us before last year ended. The phone with an almost bezel-less display would be available soon and was expected to debut in the US with an 18:9 display. The time has come for the phone to be officially launched at the Mobile World Congress. As earlier described, the device comes equipped with a full-screen display and dual camera system that is great even for low light situations. It’s a mid-range phone alright but is packed with premium specs, making this Blade V9 a powerhouse.. ZTE Mobile Devices wants to deliver excellence at such an affordable price of €269 ($330). The dual lens camera setup with 16MP sensors also comes with 6P lens, PDAF 2.0 for faster focus speed by 40%, and larger aperture. The 5.7-inch FHD+ screen with 18:9 aspect ratio makes it ideal for viewing photos, watching videos, playing video games, and browsing the web. A longer display allows for a more efficient browsing and navigation because you can view and do more at once on one screen.. Other specs of the ZTE Blade V9 include 3GB or 4GB RAM, 32GB or 64GB onboard storage, Octa core 1.8GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 processor, Adreno 506 GPU, Bluetooth 4.2, NFC, 4G LTE, WiFi, and 3100mA battery. The device already runs Android 8.1 Oreo.. The company has also introduced the ZTE Blade V9 Vita which is a smaller variant. It’s more affordable at only €179 which is about $220 in the US. It boasts a 5.45-inch HD screen, 2GB RAM, 16GB of onboard storage, Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor, Dual, 13MP plus 2MP rear-facing cameras, 8MP selfie shooter, micro-USB charging, headphone jack, and a 3200mAh battery. Color options include Black, Blue, Pink, and Dark Blue. Phone already runs Android 8.1 Oreo.. ZTE Blade V9 with almost bezel-less display available soon.

Home News ZTE launches Blade V9, V9 VITA, and Tempo Go smartphones. [MWC 2018] ZTE launches Blade V9, V9 VITA, and Tempo Go smartphones. ZTE has launched three new Android-based smartphones at the MWC 2018 event; the Blade V9 , Blade V9 VITA , and the Tempo Go. The Blade V9 and V9 VITA are mid-range smartphones, whereas the Tempo Go is an entry-level smartphone. For your information, the ZTE brand hasn’t been launched in India yet, and these three smartphones will not be officially available in India for purchase. Below are the detailed specifications of each device.. Starting with the design, the ZTE Blade V9 is a very attractive looking smartphone; the front and the back of the device are covered by an eight-layered glass, which gives the device a distinguished look. Adding to the aesthetics is a bezel-less IPS LCD display with Full HD+ resolution. However, the bezels are quite thick, like that of the Google Pixel 2 XL. The smartphone uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 450 SoC, which is powerful enough to perform every task without issues, but we aren’t sure how capable will it be in proving smooth gaming graphics at FHD+ display resolution. Surprisingly, even though the Blade V9 is a mid-range smartphone, it comes pre-loaded with Android 8.1 Oreo OS with a custom theme from ZTE.. Moving on to the imaging, ZTE has equipped the Blade V9 with the currently trending dual-camera setup. The dual-camera setup includes one 16MP sensor and one 5MP sensor, which allows the device to capture images with bokeh effect. According to ZTE, the Blade V9’s camera has PDAF 2.0, which will cut the focusing time by 40%. Also, the camera is aided by a dual-tone dual-LED flash. As for the selfies, the device has an 8MP sensor above the display. The Blade V9 packs a 3100mAh battery, and a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. The top-end variant of the Blade V9 has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, whereas the lower-end variants are available with 3GB RAM and 32GB storage, and 2GB RAM and 16GB storage. The pricing of the ZTE Blade V9 has not been revealed yet.. The ZTE Blade V9 VITA is a trimmed-down version of the Blade V9. The Blade V9 VITA has a 5.45-inch bezel-less display with HD+ resolution, instead of the 5.75-inch FHD+ unit in the Blade V9. The dual-camera setup is also a downgraded unit; it has a 13MP + 2 MP resolution. The resolution of the front-facing camera has also been trimmed down to 5MP. Lastly, the device uses Snapdragon 435 SoC, which is significantly less powerful than the Snapdragon 450 SoC used in the Blade V9.. Apart from the changes mentioned above, the rest of the specs of the Blade V9 VITA are similar to the Blade V9, including the connectivity options, eight layered glass, battery capacity, and Android 8.1 Oreo OS. The ZTE Blade V9 is available in 2GB RAM and 16GB storage, or 3GB RAM and 32GB storage variants. The 16GB storage variant costs $250 (Rs. 16,171), and the 32GB storage variant costs $300 (Rs. The ZTE Tempo Go is an entry-level smartphone. The smartphone is based on the lighter version of Android, the Android Go. For your information, the Android Go OS can run smoothly even on devices with low processing power and low RAM capacities. Although, it doesn’t has as many features as the regular Android OS. The Tempo Go has a 5-inch LCD display at the front with WVGA resolution. The imaging is carried out by a 5MP primary shooter, and a 2MP front shooter. The device houses Snapdragon 210 SoC, 1GB RAM, and 8GB of internal storage. The ZTE Tempo Go costs just $80 (Rs. Subscribe to get Latest Technology news delivered to your inbox.

It’s a dog-eat-dog world on the 2018 mid-ranger scene and like most of it’s competitors, ZTE is really trying hard to compete and stay relevant. To that end, the Blade V9 is a good value offer, even if not particularly distinctive.. Build-wise, the 5.7-inch device feels surprisingly light in the hand. Still, ZTE boasts a metal frame as the core of the chassis, with glass wrapping around it on both sides.. There was no mention of Gorilla Glass or any other increased protection finish during the presentation, so we can’t really judge on durability quite yet. Still, ZTE is particularly proud of it eight layer design for the back and with good reason. The surface provides a pretty light show. Provided you can keep your fingerprints off it for long enough to actually enjoy it.. Anyway, the LCD panels panels in both the regular V9 and the V9 VITA were surprisingly impressive. Apparently, these come courtesy of LG and upon preliminary observation offer great angles and get super bright. Of course, we can’t exactly quantify any of these claims prior to the review, but the Google Pixel 2 XL, which we had handy, couldn’t shine nearly as bright as the ZTE pair.. Both ZTE phones get the trendy new 18:9 aspect ratio, which definitely makes them more relevant on the 2018 scene and makes for a better value proposition.. Picture clarity and sharpness looked good on both the V9 and V9 VITA, even though the latter has a native HD+ resolution, while its bigger sibling has FullHD+ to work with. While on the subject of differences, the V9 VITA is not only smaller in overall size, but also plastic all around. Some of its colors also offer a slight sandstone feel, like the Dark Blue one. It also comes in a subtle Pink shade, although you can’t really tell from the photos, thanks to ZTE’s horrible choice of lighting. In contrast, the Black, Gold, Blue and Gray variants of the regular Blade V9 all come with the same smooth glass finish.. Of course, the pair also differs slightly in internals and in the camera department. Although, again, we can only say by how much with certainty once we get them in the office for review. One thing that did stand out, UX-wise, however, is the very Vanilla-like Android experience on both phones. ZTE seems to be loading in ROMs very close to stock, with barely any bloat and skinning on top.. In fact, we would even go as far as to liken the experience to than on one of Google’s own Pixel phones. You get mostly the same minimal default app package. Even the swipe up gesture to enter the app drawer is there. Hopefully this minimalistic approach enabled better and longer software support for the Blade V9 and V9 VITA.. Perhaps the most persuasive aspect of the Blade V9 and Blade V9 Vita, though, is their pretty competitive pricing. You can expect to see them retail starting at $300 and $250, respectively..

The Blade V9 sports a 5.7-inch 18:9 FHD+ display, with minimal bezels. The company's presentation, in fact, claims that the device has an 83.6% screen to body ratio, which would make it one of the best in the market in that regards.

There's a 5 MP camera nestled at the front of the device for selfies. Like the regular Blade V9, it also gets its juice from a 3200 mAh battery and runs on Android Oreo out of the box. There's a base variant with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of storage (â¬179), and another with 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage (â¬199)..

While on the subject of differences, the V9 VITA is not only smaller in overall size, but also plastic all around. Some of its colors also offer a slight sandstone feel, like the Dark Blue one. It also comes in a subtle Pink shade, although you can’t really tell from the photos, thanks to ZTE’s horrible choice of lighting. In contrast, the Black, Gold, Blue and Gray variants of the regular Blade V9 all come with the same smooth glass finish.. Of course, the pair also differs slightly in internals and in the camera department. Although, again, we can only say by how much with certainty once we get them in the office for review. One thing that did stand out, UX-wise, however, is the very Vanilla-like Android experience on both phones. ZTE seems to be loading in ROMs very close to stock, with barely any bloat and skinning on top.. In fact, we would even go as far as to liken the experience to than on one of Google’s own Pixel phones. You get mostly the same minimal default app package. Even the swipe up gesture to enter the app drawer is there. Hopefully this minimalistic approach enabled better and longer software support for the Blade V9 and V9 VITA.. Perhaps the most persuasive aspect of the Blade V9 and Blade V9 Vita, though, is their pretty competitive pricing. You can expect to see them retail starting at $ 300 and $ 250, respectively..
