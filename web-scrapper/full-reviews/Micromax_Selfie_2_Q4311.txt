Micromax Selfie 2 Q4311 - user opinions and reviews. While playing any game, suddenly game freezes and after 4-5 seconds screen locks automatically. Being particular at first it happened with "asphalt 8" with high graphics setting, then I changed it to medium graphics, but still it was of no good. At first I thought being a heavy game might be the reason {what the hell 3GB RAM doing there if it cannot hold such game}. I've already played asphalt 8 on "YU Yureka Plus" with 2GB RAM, and it ran very smooth even with high graphics setting, processor was different though. But later when I was playing a 100MB game {limbo} and again repeatedly game freezed and screen locked. So, being heavy game has nothing to do with it. Have anyone got solution for this?. Battery pack up very poor ,daily charge twice ,without using internent. This phone isn't switching on whether it's LED indicator shows charging but it isn't working. Normal usb cable is not compatible for this phone which type of usb cable is compatible for this phone. Anonymous, 01 Aug 2017 Everything is far good except the chipset.. If u use SD435 or SD430 it could be a great phone ... more Bro don't be in wrong impression,. I own both Moto G5 and Moto C plus. G5 with SD430 and 3GB RAM whereas C plus Meditek with 2GB RAM. Believe me G5 hangs more times than C Plus. i also visited Moto service center twice but no result. wrong size updated 5.2 inches as per officail website. Everything is good but I'm experiencing screen malfunctioning..

Selfie 2--Which of the Chinese re Brands has been chosen this time?!. Everything is far good except the chipset. If u use SD435 or SD430 it could be a great phone in this price bracket. And I don't know why they use better thing in YU then Micromax.. I don't know when this cheap mediatek 6737 chipset will die better if they choose HelioP20. PKM1, 31 Jul 2017 It's a good set just released in India at around Rs 10k. Should give good competition to the v... it hardly can play any shit.
