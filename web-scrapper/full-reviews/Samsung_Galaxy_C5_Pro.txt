more ... more .... more ... more .... Samsung Galaxy C5 Pro and C7 Pro coming soon. Samsung Galaxy C5 Pro and C7 Pro coming soon. posted by Ben R.. Tags :. Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. Earlier this year, Samsung launched the Galaxy C5 and Galaxy C7. Both are equipped with full-HD displays and where the C5 includes a 5.2-inch panel, the larger C7 dips into phablet territory with a 5.7-inch effort. Just four months after the metal-clad handsets were made official, Samsung is said to be working on Pro versions of each.. The C5 and C7 launched exclusively to China and as yet, have not made their way to other markets. With this in mind, it's relatively doubtful that either the C5 Pro (SM-C5010) or the C7 Pro (SM-C7010) will branch out beyond the People's Republic. There's no word on the specs as yet, but if other 'Pro' releases from Samsung are anything to go by, we can expect a reasonable under-hood refresh.. As a reminder, both the Galaxy C5 and C7 bundle a decent collection of internal hardware.. The former is equipped with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 617 SoC, 4 GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable storage. The C7, meanwhile, includes a the Snapdragon 625 SoC, 4 gigs of RAM once more, and 32 or 64 GB of expandable real estate. Both include fingerprint scanners, and while the C5's 2600 mAh battery is out-sized by the 3300 mAh juice pack of the C7, both include support for fast charging.. There's also not much info on when the Pro models will arrive. When they do, however, they could be accompanied by the. Samsung Galaxy C9 spotted on Zauba with its monstrous 6-inch display. Since these C series handsets have passed through the FCC in recent times, there's at least some hope they could make it to the United States at some point.. Given that the 32-gig C7 launched for the equivalent of $400, would you consider such a device at this price? Take a look at the images of the C5 and C7 below and let us know of your thoughts in the comments.. Galaxy C5 and C7 in pictures. Galaxy C5 and C7 in pictures. Galaxy C5 and C7 in pictures.

Although it’s a Pro version, users will get the same screen size that was in the standard Samsung Galaxy C5 which is a 5.2-inch screen showing 1920 x 1080 pixels resolution and 424ppi of pixel density. It’s quite a good looking phone as well with attractive colors like Lake Blue, Powder Rose and Maple Leaf. While there is nothing unique about the design, it definitely stands out thanks to its attractive colors options. The phone is quite thin at 7mm and weighs only about 145g. As the phone is already available in some places, it won’t take long to get the Samsung Galaxy C5 Pro release date UAE now.. A lot of selfie camera focused phones are being released nowadays but it’s still difficult to find a phone with 16-megapixel camera.
