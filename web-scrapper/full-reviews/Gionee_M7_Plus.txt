Gionee M7 Plus Luxury Smartphone Launches With Snapdragon 660, 10W Wireless Charging & ¥4399 Price. by Habeeb Onawole 3 months ago 5. Gionee M7 Plus Design Gionee M7 Plus Specs Gionee M7 Plus Price. The Gionee S11 and S11S launched earlier tonight might be considered as flagships but the Gionee M7 Plus is the true flagship of the night.. The M7 Plus ditches the metal and glass design of the S11 duo for imported calfskin leather and 21K gold plated metal. The leather covers the back, while the metal frame and the rectangular metal plate housing the rear cameras get the gold-plating treatment.. Up front, the M7 Plus doesn’t look bad at all. The top and bottom bezels are significantly smaller and wear a blue coat rather than black and there are practically no bezels on the sides.. Overall, the Gionee M7 Plus isn’t quite the stunner but it does look better than the last Gionee phone with a leather body – the Gionee M2017 .. The M7 Plus has a 6.43-inch AMOLED Full View screen with an 86% screen-to-body ratio. There is 6GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage which is more than sufficient. For the processor, Gionee has settled for the Snapdragon 660 mobile platform.. The Gionee M7 Plus packs dual rear cameras. One is a 16MP f/1.8 sensor and the other is an 8MP sensor. There is also an 8MP sensor in front for selfies.. The key features of the M7 Plus doesn’t end there. It packs a massive 5000mAh battery with support for 10W wireless fast charging – a first for Gionee phones. There is a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, Bluetooth 5.0, dual SIM slots, and a micro USB port.. Gionee also says the M7 Plus has dual security chips like most of its other flagship phones. One chip is for data encryption and the other is for secure payments and for fingerprint encryption.. Gionee S11& S11S Official: Packs Full View Displays, 3D Glass Design, & Four Cameras. The M7 Plus doesn’t come cheap. Gionee is asking for ¥4399 (~$667) for the flagship. This shouldn’t come as a surprise for those familiar with Gionee’s pricing. The M7 Plus is billed to go on sale January 1, 2018.. Tags: Gionee Gionee M7 Plus Snapdragon 660. I breathe tech! Want to get me to talk about something else? Then try movies.

Pictures of the incredibly unique Gionee M7 Plus leak. by Matt Adams November 2, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. The rest of the back holds a dual camera, LED flash, and, fingerprint sensor all in a gold-plated stainless steel plate.. Back in September, Gionee introduced the M7 and M7 Power, and now we’re getting a look at the third phone in the M7 lineup. The Gionee M7 Plus has been leaked with some hands-on pictures that give us a look at the rather distinct design.. The display on the Gionee M7 Plus allegedly measures in at 6.43-inches and is one of, if not the, biggest displays on a phone today. Not only is the display massive, it follows the 2017 trend of using an 18:9 (or 2:1) aspect ratio, too. From the leaked pictures, we can see that the screen takes up much of the front of the phone in the same way that the LG V30 ‘s does. There’s only room only for a logo at the bottom and a speaker grill, camera, and sensors at the top.. Flipping over to the rear of the device, we find some interesting designÂ. The backing appears to be made out of leather or a faux-leather material. We’re unable at this time to determine quite what it is. We’ve seen phones with real leather backs like the Moto X Pure Edition Â. or LG G4 , but most phones that try to pull this off end up using a faux leather (or “vegan leather”) substitute. We’ll have to wait for the official launch to find out exactly what its made out of.. Best Android phones (February 2018): our picks, plus a giveaway. With Android thoroughly dominating the mobile industry, picking the best Android smartphones is almost synonymous with choosing the best smartphones, period. But while Android phones have few real opponents on other platforms, internal competition is â¦. If you’re going to go all out with a massive display and gold plating, you might as well throw in some leather too.Â. Some are going to take digs at Gionee for making a phone that looks like their grandma’s change purse, but at least it’s not producing the same glass sandwich everyone else is. It’s giving customers some options and that should be applauded. It may not be for everyone, but we like when companies take risks.. According to the leak, the Gionee M7 Plus is “coming soon” and we’ll certainly keep our eyes peeled for it. What do you think about the phone? Do the different materials appeal to you?
