The ZTE Axon 7 Max launches with a massive 6-inch display and 4GB of RAM. Yet another phone has been released in the growing ZTE Axon 7 series. We already have the ZTE Axon 7 and the Axon 7 Mini, and now we have a new addition — the ZTE Axon 7 Max.. The new device is a pretty sweet deal, especially for those looking for a phone with a larger-than-average display. That’s thanks to its somewhat hefty 6.0-inch 3D-capable screen, and while it does have a resolution of 1080p, most won’t care too much about the under-par resolution.. On top of the huge screen is a pretty awesome design. While the device’s appearance isn’t too different from the other Axon 7 phones in the series, that’s not a bad thing — the super thin bezels and premium look carry over to the Axon 7 Max. In fact, 84 percent of the front of the device accounts for the screen, which is a pretty good figure and should help keep the overall size of the device down despite the fact that it has a 6.0-inch display.. Apart from the display, you’ll find a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, which should help increase the security of the phone. And to really take security to the next level, the device also detects things like finger skin color and heart rate, which helps prevent the cloning of your fingerprint. You know, in case you keep government secrets on your phone, or have secrets you’d like to keep yourself.. Also on the back of the phone, you’ll find a dual camera setup, which houses a 13MP primary camera and a 13MP depth-of-field camera, which only takes black and white photos and is used to give extra details to your photos.. Under the hood, the phone features a 4,100mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 support, as well as a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor and 4GB of RAM. You’ll get 64GB of storage, which can be brought up to 200GB with a microSD card. The phone costs 2,999 Yuan, which equates to $442, and it will go on sale.

ZTE Axon 7 Max with 6" 1080p screen stars in live images. ZTE is currently working on a successor for the Axon Max from last year. The new model is going to be called Axon 7 Max, fitting in the Chinese company's portfolio right alongside the Axon 7 and Axon 7 mini , both of which are already official.. The Axon 7 Max is bound to be announced soon, seeing as how prototype units are already in the wild. And one of these has been photographed from a few angles - see it below in all its glory.. The Axon 7 design language can be seen in the Max version too. The full metal body is there, and this handset even brings a dual rear camera to the party. That said, some of its other specs will be decidedly mid-range. The 6-inch touchscreen will only have 1080p resolution, while the SoC powering the Axon 7 Max is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625. This will however be paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.. The Axon 7 Max will run Android 7.0 Nougat underneath ZTE's MiFavor UI 4.0. The spec details come courtesy of the information screens portrayed in two of the photos above. There's no information about the dual rear camera's resolution. On the other hand, the fingerprint scanner is clearly visible on the back, as are a dual-LED flash and laser autofocus window. Hopefully we'll find out more about the ZTE Axon 7 Max soon..

Jules Wang October 14, 2016 4:55 pm. Like its more conventional Chinese manufacturing competition, ZTE believes that its smartphones have three markets to serve: S , M and L.

Take into consideration the warehouse, from which the device will be shipped and consult your local customs regulations, so you will be prepared to pay any customs fees and taxes, if necessary. For example, if you're based in Europe and you order a device from a warehouse in China, it is very likely that the device will be held by the customs in your country and will be cleared once you pay the due taxes. Hence, it might turn out that ordering a device from an EU warehouse might be cheaper. Don't forget to check the delivery and warranty conditions of the online store you want to buy from. Before ordering, check whether the device is in stock and its final price in your local currency. Please, take the quoted rates as tentative due to the fluctuation of exchange rates and the frequent pricing updates by the stores.

Smartphone Zte Axon 7 Max - Recensione Caratteristiche Prezzo Source: Smartphone e tablet android IT→EN Single Review, online available, Medium, Date: 01/10/2017 Rating: performance: 80% display: 80% mobility: 80% workmanship: 80%. Zbyt drogi gigant z "nagim ekranem 3D" Source: Komorkomania PL→EN Positive: Dual cameras; excellent 3D display; good speakers; long battery life.. Single Review, online available, Medium, Date: 10/30/2016. Model : The smartphone market is ever increasing and competition inevitably turns rife and stiff. Consumers ultimately benefit as manufacturers push to produce cheaper and better smartphones. The release of the ZTE Axon 7 Max marks the sequel to its highly successful Axon 7. At first glance, this smartphone bears the form of a well-made device. Notwithstanding its wide display, it maintains a slim profile. The back of the phone is metal built, which feels smooth and pleasant to the grip. The ZTE Axon 7 Max sports a 6-inch full-HD IPS display with a pixel density of 367 ppi. One of the key features in the Axon 7 Max is the introduction of 3D viewing capabilities with naked eyes (ânaked 3Dâ display) on this device. This technology allows for the viewing of 3D content on the smartphoneâs display without the need for polarized glasses. This will certainly appeal those who rely on smartphones for extensive video viewing. In terms of performance, the Axon 7 Max runs on an octa-core Snapdragon 625 processor with a whopping 4 GB RAM. This processor has recently been a popular choice among manufacturers for their mid range devices largely due to its energy efficiency.. The expanded memory is essential for maximising performance in graphics intensive programs. The internal flash memory has a capacity of 64 GB. The storage capacity can be expanded by up to 200 GB with a microSD card. Users will definitely need this bloated storage to store contents with rich graphics. For the shutterbugs, the ZTE Axon 7 Max sports dual 13 MP cameras at the back with laser autofocus and a dual-LED flash module. The front-facing camera on the other hand is an 8 MP shooter for selfies. The cameras aren't particularly special in any way, but they do the job. A circular fingerprint scanner sits at the rear side of the smartphone. Connectivity on the ZTE Axon 7 Max includes Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, A-GPS, Glonass, a 3.5 mm audio jack, and a USB Type-C port. To pair its superior high graphics performance, this device is packed with dual Hi-Fi AK4962 audio chips for better audio output. It is integrated with some remarkable audio based features, including a real time voice translator, voice activated camera commands for multi-shot and timers, and a voice assistant. The Axon 7 Max runs on the latest Android 7.0 Nougat. Overall, the Axon 7 Max brings apparent improvements compared to its predecessor. One notable upgrade is the integration of the 3D viewing capabilities with naked eyes. Whether or not such improvements warrant an upgrade remains a moot point but it certainly adds some spice to the already dense industry.. This display is quite big for a smartphone but frequently used for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. ZTE is short for Zhong Xing Telecommunication Equipment Company Limited, which was founded in China in 1985. The product range includes, for example, USB sticks, routers, smartphones and tablets.. The ratings of the relatively many reviews have a wide range from below-average to very good (as of 2016).. Similar devices from a different Manufacturer. Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus Adreno 506.

Tags :. Android - Android + ZTE - ZTE +. ZTE is one of the few Chinese companies which releases its flagships for the US market, and hopefully the newly-announced Axon 7 Max won't be any different in that regard, as the Axon 7 proved pretty popular here thanks to its stellar price-to-value ratio.. We doubt it, though, as the Axon 7 Max is not stuffed to the gills with top-shelf specs, but rather boasts a 6" 1080p panel,. 2.0 GHz octa-core Snapdragon 625 chipset, 4 GB of RAM, 64 GB of storage plus a microSD card, and a 4100 mAh battery. Still not too shabby, but the 6-inch panel is pretty telling that ZTE is aiming this thing towards the Asian market, where big- screen phones sell like hot cakes.. ZTE Axon 7 Max boasts a dual rear camera setup with two 13 MP units (one for depth of field) that take advantage of a laser autofocusing system. That's not the only arrow in its multimedia quiver, though, as it also has a dedicated AK4962 hi-res audio chip, and a "Naked 3D" display layer that lets you watch 3D content without special glasses.. Sounds like a pretty interesting device , especially at the reasonable $440 price. That's in China, however - if the Axon Max 7 ever makes it on this side of the pond, it is likely to cost higher..

By gantlet , Junior Member on 25th March 2017, 09:45 PM. Is there any available root method and/or custom firmware for ZTE AXON 7 MAX (C2017) Chinese?. I have bought the above and already have search almost everything about the above but nothing to find. The chinese seller looks like he knows the method but does not want to share anyting. My C2017 is already unlocked with multilanguage and google play with android V6.0.1 (ZTE_C2017V2.0.0B07) but is unrooted. The official rom has only chinese and english without google play. I found a thread about the same mobile posted here at the first days of January with negative answer but there are almost 3 months till then and I wonder if there is anything new about it. I tried every automatic methods with apks or through pc and none of them manage to root the mobile (iroot, kingoroot, superuser etc).

Or we need to wait some more.... Join Date: Joined: Apr 2017. Please made the review of the phone. Probably most reason why lack of information is because nobody knows this phone. Internet is empty on this matter - no owner reviews, just reports from expos. What is the screen quality? Is it visible in sunny days? Image is sharp or parallax layer causing distortions?. Join Date: Joined: Mar 2017. ZTE AXON 7 MAX (C2017) Discription. In a matter of fact you are right, there is no user discription and reviews, but just sellers or ZTE review. About the most considering thing the someone would buy this device would be the 3D screen and camera. So I'm warning first the negatives from my prospect. These are what I don't like and disapointed me and they may not fit other's people opinion. There are 2 back cameras, the primary camera and the secondary camera in about 1cm distance from primary camera but I have not any details of the secondary. This one is not capture images. It is not used for the second sbs 3d photo as it not capture a visible image. It is like a depth viewer so 3D photos are actually not stereoscopic 3D by default but an software processed 2D to 3D photo of what primary camera saw and what secondary felt. So there are fails on some points of 3D that looks weird or may give a pain to your eyes. You can give a worse result if you hide the secondary camera with your finger, you can still see and capture a complete photo but the 3D result will be abolutelly random. Also the 3D video is not stable at all, it mentions (lab) on selection and definitely you cannot enjoy 3D at all, its awfull and it makes you dizzy from the first 10 seconds (even I get dizzy that I like 3D and I’m used to 3D devices and views). Also the 3D photos are saved *.jpg and not as *.jps or *.mpo like all other stereoscopic products. its is still sbs 3D and rename it from *.jpg to *.jps will work but this is not convinient. Also it is not recognize the above file extentions to its internal viewer so you have to install a third party image viewer like sView or Stereoscope. Also I have not found any apk that can capture 3D photos simulateusly, you can only use the preinstalled one. So I now use this phone in 2D photo shooting. About the screen is 6" fullHD with very nice colors and strong backlight that make it easy to use it in sunny days. the 3D parralax layer is clearly visible (there is a 3D software button but is does nothing). according to the angle in portrait view you can see shadowed areas on screen... In landscape view, if you are watching a 3D image or a 3D movie its outstanding and very sharp and clear BUT again if you are watching something in 2D you can see it distorting because of parralax layers. this is more annoying with text (the letters are kind of weird but you can read it not that easily) and with high contrast symbols etc. It is not that annoying with 2D images and 2D movies which have smoother contrast, you can still see the distortion but you'll get use to it. I had a LG optimus 3D (P920) before this one and there was no parralax layer visible at all... and the photos where pure stereoscopic 3D. One possitive thing about this phone is that it has a very low battery consuption and it may last 4-5 days with normal use with wifi always open. According to the "Droid Hardware Info" apk the specs are as follow:. Get notifications on your computer for shared files and important events. CPU Architecture: AArch64 Processor rev 4 (aarch64). Clock Speed: 652 MHz - 2016 MHz. CPU Features: fp asimd evtstrm aes pmull sha1 sha2 crc32. If you have any questions about this phone I'll glad to help.

The handset also boasts some useful. audio based features, including a real time voice translator, voice activated camera commands for multi-shot and timers, and a voice assistant.

This new audio functionality also sees ZTE remove the dedicated AK4490EN DAC for a AK4962 codec with an integrated voice DSP,. which fortunately still seems to be a. On paper SNR increases from 120dB to 125dB, while THD+N falls from -112dB to -106dB, although real world use won’t quite match up..
