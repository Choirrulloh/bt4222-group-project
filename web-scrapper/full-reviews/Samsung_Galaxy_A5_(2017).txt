The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards.

Sales man told me it's a gorilla glass. I like gorilla glass because it's unbreakable. So I was thinking that it's unbreakable. So that I didn't use protection for that. After 1 month it fell down by my hands & broken the glass. So I went to the Samsung gallery. They told me that gorilla glass is scratch proof not unbreakable & there is no warranty on glass.I was shocked.they ask me to pay 13000 Rs to repair it. So please don't buy this mobile. It's not a gorilla glass it's a normal glass. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 1 out of 3 people found this review helpful. Samsung Galaxy S8+, Galaxy A5, Galaxy A7 (2017) Price in India Slashed.

Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) review: a mid-range phone with premium features. Our review of the 2016 Galaxy A5. Why Samsung is keeping the Note brand. Samsung kicked off 2017 by presenting the Galaxy A5 2017 and Galaxy A3 2017 at the CES in Las Vegas, both devices with design traits clearly borrowed from the Galaxy S7. In this first hands-on review of the Galaxy A5 2017, we’ll give you a run-down of Samsung's new mid-range gem with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow running on board.. Lowest price: Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017). Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) release date and price. Unveiled in early January, it will be available starting February 3 in four different colors: black sky, gold sand, peach cloud, blue mist. So far, there is no word about US availability, but the phone will be made available in the UK for £399, which would be about $500.. While unboxing the phone, we discovered the included USB Type-C, the 5V / A2 charger and the pin for opening. the SIM and MicroSD card trays.. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) design and build quality. It definitely drew design inspiration form the S7. An elegant design that stands out from other mid-range devices. The camera doesn't protrude from the back. The speaker is now on the right side. A small difference from the previous model, the headphone jack is on the right. The Galaxy A5 2017 is a head turner among mid-range devices thanks to its elegant design. In the past years, the design of mid-range phones has progressed and become. more elegant and better assembled, giving those who buy them hardly a reason to eye high-end variants. One of these well-built smartphones is of course the Galaxy A5 2017 thanks to its evident similarity with the Galaxy S7.. a metallic unibody coated with 3D glass. The front can be distinguished from the Galaxy S7 in that the upper and lower bezels are broader. the Samsung logo is up top alongside the front camera lens, proximity sensor and speaker for calls. On the top of the display, you’ll find the home button with integrated fingerprint reader, and the back and recent apps capacitative buttons.. The glossy body has curved edges which are encased in a metal frame. On the back: here you’ve got the Samsung logo, the LED flash and the barely protruding camera lens. Thanks to its sleek design, the phone doesn’t wobble when put on a flat surface.. A new feature is the location of the speaker next to the power button on the the right side of the display, which is featured on the bottom of the Galaxy S7 and last year’s Galaxy A5. The decision to move the speaker was likely motivated by the fact the bottom-located speakers are often covered up by the hand when gaming.. The bottom edge lacks the classic grill for the speaker, but keeps the headphone jack on the right next to the USB Type-C port.. The volume buttons are on the left side of the device with the nano SIM, while the MicroSD card slot can be found along the top edge. It is in this detail that the A5 differs from the A3 2017: the latter only has one slot at the top that accommodates both card types together.. The black metal frame encasing the body is interrupted by the gray antenna bands. The lines on the Galaxy A5 2017 are a lot softer than the previous model, and with dimensions of 146.1 x 71.4 x 7.9 mm, it is larger than the Galaxy S7, but has the same thickness. It is also 7 grams lighter than the high-end model, weighing in at 159 grams. The curved edges and the reflection off the device mask its true size, seeing as from a first glance you’d never think it was bigger than the Galaxy S7 or previous model.. The curved edges and the reflection off the device mask its true size, seeing as from a first glance you’d never think it was bigger than the Galaxy S7 or previous model.. Holding the Galaxy A5 is comfortable, it’s easy to handle with one hand, and it isn't. A negative but unavoidable aspect with the choice of materials is that it attracts fingerprints, as in the case with many phones. I find the black model used in the review to be aesthetically pleasing, but this is a subjective matter. The phone is elegant and subtle. Those who open the box will not be disappointed by what they find inside.. The Galaxy A5 2017 has the Always-on feature, which is not common among mid-range phones.. The Galaxy A5 is always on. The Galaxy A5 2017 has a 5.2-inch Super AMOLED screen with a Full HD resolution (1920 x 1080 pixels) resulting in 412 ppi. The screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 4. resolution are therefore identical to those of preceeding generation. The colors, at first glance, are brilliant and the same can be said of all viewing angles. positive regarding the display, but with the Super AMOLED Samsung playing on home turf!. The Galaxy A5 2017 has the Always-on feature, which is not common among mid-range phones. introduced with the Galaxy S7 that allows you to keep tabs on the time, date and battery status even when the screen is off, a feature not to take for granted in the likes of a mid-range phone.. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) special features. Samsung packed a solid punch behind the Galaxy A series this year by adding IP68 certification, a feature that is also not common on mid-range phones. This certification protects the phone from dust and water, making the device better suited to use when doing outdoor activities (within reason). The Galaxy A5 2017 can be immersed to a depth of 1.5 meters for no longer than 30 minutes.. The A5 is coming with Android Marshmallow. TouchWiz is showing off its more modern look. This is one of the features that may irk potential owners: it comes stocked with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and not the latest iteration of Android, Android 7.0 Nougat. The latter was released in August, has yet to reach. the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge and is expected to be available for the Galaxy A5 2017 in the coming months.. TouchWiz is running on board, as is the norm for Samsung Galaxy phones. The interface has been cleaned up over the years and now has a modern look. In the final review, we’ll be able to explore and report on the interface a little more in depth.. Among the preinstalled apps, you will find Google apps and services, Samsung apps (S Health and S Voice) and six. Under the hood of the Galaxy A5, you’ll find an octacore Exynos 7880 that ticks at 1.9 GHz and 3GB of RAM. The graphics are powered by a Mali T830 MP3 chip. The phone comes with 32 GB of internal storage that you can expand up to 256 GB with an SD card. According the figures on the tech specs table, the Galaxy A5 2017 should be able to provide an adequate performance.. While testing the device for my initial hands-on review, I was able to see that the smartphone functions fluidly, but that is what is to be expected from a new device. In our hands on review, which we will soon complete, we’ll be able to report more extensively on the performance and benchmark results.. Like previously mentioned in the review, Samsung decided to move the speaker from the bottom to the left side, meaning the speaker will no longer be covered when you use the device in landscape mode, for instance when playing a game or watching a video. Whether this really improves user experience will be further tested and reported on in our final review.. Samsung also includes earbuds in the box, which we will later test. has an antenna with various audio settings, such as an equalizer, as seen on the Galaxy A5 2016.. Both the front and back camera have 16 MP. Samsung was able to up the ante from last year’s model, especially in the camera department, where the camera only had 5 MP. Both come with an aperture of f/1.9, but only the back camera has optical image stabilization.. The camera comes with many filters and modes, which you can access by swiping from right to left. The modes are: basic, beauty, Pro, HDR, Panorama and Night. For group selfies, the front camera also has panorama mode, and it. allows you to change the tone. of your skin, size of your eyes and face shape. Both cameras can also take videos in 1080p. More will be shown in our final review.. Samsung was able to show that it doesn’t want to merge with other mid-range devices, but instead stay at the top of the game.. The Galaxy A5 2017 has a great new design that could be mistaken for a high-end phone, along with nice new colors that follow current trends. It also comes with features that we don’t usually find in this caliber. of phone, such as IP68 certification, USB Type-C and Always On. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) technical specifications. 146.1 x 71.4 x 7.9 mm. 1920 x 1080 pixels (424 ppi). Even just having moved the speaker will do wonders to improve user experience. This small but significant factor shows us that the Samsung put a lot of effort into the Galaxy A series to come up with a quality phone. So far, there is no news about a US release, but it will show its face in the UK starting in February at a price of £399, which would be around $500. may cause some users to shy away, especially if you consider that the OnePlus 3T, a high-end device, costs about the same. Our first impressions of the Galaxy A5 2017 is that it is a top class mid-range phone. Check back to find out more about the phone in our final review.. let me say first here, its garbage. i was using a g4 and got the samsung galaxy a5 2017 as a replacement. there are a couple of key features that lg incorporates in their phones that samsung either didnt think about or didnt see that they were as extremely useful as they are. the led reminder, the double tap top open the phone, or even the user interface. im not an lg fan boy and i wouldnt even recommend their g4 due to the bootloop issue they dont seem to want to fix. BUT in essence its user interface was more user friendly and a lot less complicated without all the garbage bloatware samsung packs into your device. the speaker on the side, is just bad, as im holding my phone while playing a game it easily gets covered up. imo its kind of an ugly phone, i dont know why ppl would stare at it unless they couldnt beleive that you owned such a god awful phone. The always on screen is really dumb and drains battery life all day. the homescreen options including their free themes are a joke. ive had flip phones ten years ago with more options. this phone will test your patience.. The internet on the phone is horrible! Whether I'm using WiFi or not, there's a 50/50 chance that I have to open a new tab to conduct a search/load a page because it won't load. Or sometimes the page takes forever to load, and I don't have many tabs open to begin with or have extra things running in the background. I want my Samsung Galaxy S5 back!. I know I should be commenting about the phone itself but I could resist saying that the girl on the video seens to be a pretty good danm robot kkk. Nothing about those materials is premium. They're fragile, heavy and poorly suited to the task of pocket usability. With plastic, you can usually swap out the part easily. Or it was light enough it didn't mar in the first place. Or it's easily rounded over with common every day tools. Many common plastics are stronger than metal by weight anyway so why are we adding needless weight to the phone again? Oh that's right, people think heft means premium for no good reason at all.. What's wrong with glass and metal? When I'm paying more than 400 bucks for a premium phone I expect it to look exactly that...premium! Samsung are not only pioneers in introducing phones with aesthetic beauty but also consistent flag bearers of the same. I've been using Samsung galaxy s7 edge for the past year and let me tell you I still keep getting oohs and aahs each time I pull it out. In fact strangers go so far as to stare at it. Oh, the joys of preening and strutting with a phone that' s bang on a looker! I am a die hard Samsung fan and would anyday prefer it over the much overrated iPhone. My husband (an ardent iPhone user) has now pre ordered the samsung Galaxy A5 2017 having read glowing reviews from at least 8 tech sources including thus one. So hats off to you guys for a wonderful review that helped us arrive at a decision.. To be honest I don't see the point in a person buying a premium samsung device anymore as the premium and mid range look the same, what I have seen premium devices get better firmware/security updates than the premium devices. The only difference is the processor and 1GB ram that you have in the premium model. Is it really worth it then buying the premium model for so much more? I don't think it is. Not to mention the people that have a s7, in other words the previous years model, would have paid so much more and now a person purchases a device the next year for much less and it looks basically, if not completely, the same.. This is a very nice phone, but being released with Android 6 in February/March of 2017 is just plain wrong and not something that should be overlooked..

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. by Victor Hristov. Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction These days, Samsung has simplified its previously huge lineup of phones: we now have the Galaxy S and Note series representing the best of Samsung, the Galaxy J series as the most affordable options, and then, there is the Galaxy A series standing right in the middle. The history of the Galaxy A series starts in the beginning of 2015, when Samsung launched this new lineup with three phones in it: the original A3, A5 and A7, differing by features, but most importantly by screen size. An update to the A series in 2016 brought trendy new glass designs, but we had complaints about the performance. This year, Samsung has just launched the brand new Galaxy A (2017): the A3 (2017) and A5 (2017) are already out there, while the A7 (2017) is coming up soon. Of all these phones, the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) is the phone that will be the right fit for most people: it is not too cheap, nor too expensive; its 5.2-inch screen is neither too big, nor too small; it’s the golden mean. The A5 (2017) also has a few tricks up its sleeve: it comes with a new-generation, more power-efficient processor, an improved camera, it sports the reversible USB-C port for charging and it even has water resistance. Add to that a premium grade glass and metal design, and you start to wonder: with all those features, isn’t this phone just as good as the Galaxy S7? We take a deeper look to find out. In the box: Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) model SM-A520F User Manual Sim ejector tool USB-A to USB-C cable White Samsung earbuds with replaceable rubber tips Adaptive Fast Charging wall charger (15 watts peak, 9V and 1.67V, or 5V and 2A) Design Designed to near perfection, with a curved glass back, metal frame and full-on water-protection. The Galaxy A5 (2017) is a real looker. In fact, its glass-and-metal construction feels so seamlessly well put together, we’d forgive you if you mistake it for the flagship Galaxy S7 model. In the hand, the phone feels well balanced, with a nice heft to it: it’s thin, but not too airy, with just enough weight to feel comfortable. The only design quirk that I personally don’t like is the disproportionately small camera on the back. This is the one element that is different than on the S7, but you do get used to it with time. The new A5 features a scratch-resistant glass on the back and comes in a selection of four distinct colors with catchy names: Black Sky, Gold Sand, Blue Mist, and Peach Cloud (we have the Blue Mist up for review). With a 5.2-inch display and tiny bezel on the side, the A5 is certainly compact. In fact, it is almost the same size as the Galaxy S7. And if you want a better idea of its physical size, feel free to check out our neat size comparison tool below. We’re glad to see the reversible USB-C port rather than the old and quickly disappearing microUSB for charging here, and the handset also has a good ol’ 3.5mm headphone jack for your headphones , speakers and AUX cables. The really cool thing about the new A5, however, is that the phone is water-proof. It is officially IP68 certified, which means the phone is protected from water damage when submerged as deep as 5 feet (1.5 meters) for up to 30 minutes. Water resistance is a premium feature usually found in the most expensive phones out there, and it’s definitely a rarity seeing it on a more affordable phone like this new A5. With a water-proof phone, you don’t need to worry about using your phone when it rains, that occasional drop in water, or taking a few pictures near water or even an underwater video in the swimming pool (just don’t use it near salty sea / ocean water, as the phone is only protected against fresh water damage).. Display A 5.2” Super AMOLED screen with good looking color and plenty of color customization options. The Galaxy A5 (2017) sports a 5.2-inch Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels. AMOLED screens come with the advantage that you can control each pixel, which his means that you can shut down individual pixels and achieve perfectly deep blacks and excellent contrast, something not possible to the same extent on LCD screens. On the downside, it’s a PenTile display, which - for the unenlightened in display tech talk - means that it has less sub-pixels, and is not quite as sharp as an RGB (most LCDs) display of the same resolution. Enough with the complicated terms, though: in reality, the screen looks very nice. It’s definitely sharp enough, so much so that at a regular viewing distance, you cannot see any jagged edges to icons or images. It also looks very good in terms of color reproduction. Samsung allows customers to fine-tune the color reproduction of the screen: go into Settings > Display > Screen Mode, and you get to choose from four different modes. The first one is the Basic mode, which we recommend as it has the best-balanced colors that are close to the sRGB color standard, accepted and used across the world. You also have the Adaptive display option that features oversaturated, punchy and impressive (but not ‘accurate’ to any particular standard) colors. There are also the Photo and Cinema modes, there with the aim to improve the look for your still and motion pictures, but we would recommend the standard Basic mode over any of these. Samsung also allows you to tweak the red, green and blue colors individually to your liking, if you are into custom colors. This is also one of the brightest AMOLED screens out there. That’s great for outdoor use, as the boosted brightness makes it easier to read what’s on the screen even on a bright, sunny day. The minimum screen brightness can drop down to 1.8 nits. The lower this value, the more comfortable is to look at the screen in bed with the lights off without the display burning your eyes. The A5 is one of the better phones in this aspect. There is now a Blue light filter on the new A5: what it does is filter out the blue light from a screen. This is important because blue light is a trigger for the brain hormone melatonin: when you see blue light, your brain makes it more difficult for your body to fall asleep, hence, using your phone without a blue light filter before bed could ruin your sleep. We’re glad to have this new Blue light filter on the A5 (2017) and you can customize it to best suite your sleep times and habits. Another one of the cool new features that has trickled down to the A5 from Samsung’s flagship phones is the ‘Always-on Display’ mode that shows you the time, date and the type of missed notifications even when your screen is locked (but not the actual notifications). The letters are contrasting and easy to see, but be warned - this drains battery like crazy, at a rate of around 1% each hour.. 5.75 x 2.81 x 0.31 inches. 146.1 x 71.4 x 7.9 mm. 5.61 x 2.74 x 0.31 inches. 142.4 x 69.6 x 7.9 mm. 5.7 x 2.8 x 0.29 inches. 144.8 x 71 x 7.3 mm. 5.44 x 2.64 x 0.28 inches. 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) Compare.

Along with the design, I also think that battery life is the best thing about this phone.. (Posts: 193; Member since: 05 Apr 2016). posted on 15 Feb 2017, 10:03.

You assume it stutters? Because you don't even own one. Also you continue to thumb up yoru own posts. (Posts: 8; Member since: 15 Jan 2012). posted on 19 Feb 2017, 08:06. How is the battery life is compared to the A7 2017?. (Posts: 1256; Member since: 15 Apr 2016). posted on 15 Feb 2017, 09:42. (Posts: 6747; Member since: 30 Sep 2014). posted on 15 Feb 2017, 05:59. "performance is fine for daily use, but start using more intense apps and / or games and the processor runs into trouble". care to elaborate? which apps this phone can't handle/ can cause trouble for that processor?. even if it doesnt use flagship level processor, it's multi-core score on geekbench almost the same as OP3T. I know geekbench is bad to be used as standard, lol.. I'm just saying it's not a slow processor... (Posts: 953; Member since: 18 Dec 2013). posted on 15 Feb 2017, 06:15. I know, right? Looks like lacking common sense.. (Posts: 907; Member since: 27 May 2011). posted on 15 Feb 2017, 06:58. You have to look at BOTH single-core and multi-core performance. Single-core performance here is definitely poor, there is absolutely no comparison with the OnePlus 3T, which is a much faster and more powerful phone. You will run into issues with games like first-person shooters and I personally have seen stutter and much slower flow when editing photos on the phone (which is what I like to do).. (Posts: 3434; Member since: 02 Dec 2011). posted on 15 Feb 2017, 12:07. It only gets half as S7 in Antutu; OP3T draws circles around it (and the iPhone 7 draws spheres).. (Posts: 244; Member since: 12 Oct 2012). posted on 15 Feb 2017, 06:43. I think it's better to buy last year's flagships instead. Bought my LG G5 on a sale last week. It was a little bit cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy A3 2017. (Posts: 907; Member since: 27 May 2011). posted on 15 Feb 2017, 06:59. I am with you on this. If it was for me, I'd still say that a Nexus 5X (if you can still find it) is the best value-to-features phone out there, and it was released 2 years ago..

It was slow, needed to place finger exactly on spot. Ididn't enjoy the phone at all.. (Posts: 2066; Member since: 23 Jan 2014). posted on 15 Feb 2017, 09:18. You'd think you could upgrade a 2014 flagship to a 2017 midrange but this doesn't even have 4K recording and i received the 6.0 update at the start of last year.. (Posts: 65; Member since: 28 Sep 2012). posted on 15 Feb 2017, 09:49. Phone Arena try testing the Lenovo P2 with it's 5,100mAh battery. I got one recently from Three UK and it's brilliant. (Posts: 2293; Member since: 31 Oct 2011). posted on 15 Feb 2017, 10:01. Honestly, the cons are pretty bad on this one. No notification LED, no video stabilization, stuttery performance... Sure the battery life is great, but does it really matter how long the device lasts if you don't enjoy using it? I'm shocked at how high a score this phone has.. (Posts: 2315; Member since: 14 Aug 2014). posted on 15 Feb 2017, 10:13. First time I've seen that battery app...Wow what a great phone.

(Posts: 372; Member since: 22 Mar 2015). posted on 15 Feb 2017, 10:27. 100% will get updated to Nougat. (Posts: 372; Member since: 22 Mar 2015). posted on 15 Feb 2017, 10:26. I reckon once Nougat lands for this phone it'll fix the stuttering for sure. I just got Nougat on my Z5 compact and it's definitely smoother. Can they add OIS in firmware updates?. (Posts: 2293; Member since: 31 Oct 2011). posted on 15 Feb 2017, 10:36. No, the O in OIS stands for Optical, which means a physical component. Digital Image Stabilization is the software solution. I imagine that they could add it after the fact, but I'm not sure how trivial a task that would be.. (Posts: 14967; Member since: 25 Sep 2013). posted on 16 Feb 2017, 09:56. Looking at the spec, the rear camera has an F1.9 lens @ 16MP. That means this camera should be better equalthe one in the S6. It's also nice that both the rear and front camera are 16MP. Hopefully the S8 will get some of that MP love. Seems to just be a lower cost S6. I mean the S6 new was $650. Has a faster newer GPU and CPU, is only slightly larger/heavier than the S6, and it has sdcard support which the S6 lacked. But if I like tine phones, I would consider this.. (Posts: 100; Member since: 02 Mar 2017). posted on 09 Apr 2017, 12:19. You can also consider A7 (2017).. (Posts: 65; Member since: 28 Sep 2012). posted on 02 Mar 2017, 12:25. I have this phone for a week now and the battery life is not all that good even with Always On Display off,hardly anything syncing,location and all sorts off. Camera is nice in daylight and performance is not stuttery though. I now miss the Lenovo P2 phone I had before with the 5,100mAh battery. (Posts: 8; Member since: 15 Jan 2012). posted on 03 Mar 2017, 12:06. What kind of SOT are you getting?. (Posts: 2; Member since: 23 Mar 2017). posted on 23 Mar 2017, 13:16. I sure wish this phone support more bands, especially Band 12. I think this is a winner, otherwise.. (Posts: 2; Member since: 23 Mar 2017). posted on 23 Mar 2017, 13:33. Not sure it supports CDMA either. I wonder if it supports VoLTE. This phone ticks off everything else on my list.. Want to comment? Please login or register ..

Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 Reviews - page 2. Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 is rated. Rated 5 out of. Got this phone 2 weeks ago. Rated 5 out of. I bought this about a week ago. I am impressed! It's fast, the sound system is great, the screen is a good size for watching videos and it's camera takes clear. And the waterproof and fingerprint scanner is definitely a step up from iPhone. Rated 3 out of. I bought this phone in November. It's really pretty and the camera is on point. However, my downloaded apps: intabgram, snapchat, etc. keep shutting down after freezing for about minutes for no reason.. Rated 3 out of. I bought this phone about 4 months ago and it worked great. I thought it was going to be an upgrade from the A3 but it's pretty much the same despite being £100 more expensive. There's nothing really special about it and the glass breaks very easily. I dropped it once from about 2ft with a protective case and it still shattered the front and the back. As well as that the LCD broke meaning a purple liquid leaked all over the inside of the screen and the phone was pretty much useless within 24 hours. So I shouldn't have dropped it but I did not have this problem with any other phone I had even though this one was much more expensive.

The new Samsung Galaxy A5 looks like a flagship, performs like a mid-ranger and is priced somewhere in-between. It's a great phone, but a middling camera and CPU ensure it doesn't fully rise above rivals.. A little pricey for the hardware. Looking for a low-cost handset? Here are our best cheap phones Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 price and release date Cheaper than a Galaxy S7, but not cheap Similar price to a OnePlus 3T At the top-end of “mid-range” Meet in the mid-range Megapixel-packed cameras Octa-core Samsung CPU 32GB of storage with microSD expansion Design and display Classy-but-plain metal and glass build AMOLED screen but not as sharp as the S7’s Water-resistant Thanks to Carphone Warehouse for providing us with a Samsung Galaxy A5 for review. The 2017 Galaxy A5 is the third phone Samsung has produced with exactly this name. It first appeared at the very end of 2014 , and Samsung has updated and tweaked the style for each new model.. [Update: The Samsung Galaxy A5 has dropped in price since launch, making it much more affordable.]. Each year the phone has classed-up its act a little, leading to this 2017 version, which you could easily mistake for a top-end phone. Dig deep enough into the hardware and you’ll find a few parts that would make the Samsung Galaxy A5 a swindle if it cost as much as the Galaxy S7 , though.. But they’re not the sort of things most people will notice every day. If you’re not obsessed with having the latest and greatest tech in your phone, you’ll probably love the Samsung Galaxy A5. And saving a few hundred dollars or pounds in the bargain is an attractive sweetener.. It’s also arguably a more successful phone than HTC’s attempt at the same idea, the pretty-but-flawed HTC U Play .. The main group that might be put off is the bargain hunter crowd. The OnePlus 3T is a more powerful phone, and has a lot more storage too, but is only $40/£30 (around AU$50) extra.. Motorola’s Moto G4 Plus is also a much better deal in the “tech per dollar” stakes. As usual, Samsung charges what it can for the Galaxy A5, rather than trying to squeeze in as much as possible.. Not everyone quibbles about every pound/dollar as much as we do, though, and for the most part the Samsung Galaxy A5 is a joy to use. The screen’s great, the battery life commendable, the size of the little guy accessible, and while the power on tap isn’t all that impressive, there’s enough to stop the phone seeming underpowered.. The Samsung Galaxy A5 shows you quite how expensive “mid-range” phones can be nowadays. It launched at $399 in the US, £369 in the UK and AU$649 in Australia.. That’s a chunk more expensive than the 2016 version of the Galaxy A5, but the phone comes with a few important feature upgrades too, like water resistance.. However the good news is more recently it has witnessed a price drop, bringing the Galaxy A5 price down to around $320, £280 SIM free.. The 2017 Galaxy A5 launched in January 2017, a year after the 2016 Galaxy A5 appeared. Much like the Galaxy S series, the mid-range A phones have started to appear annually, and more reliably than the average train.. Just look at the spec list of the Samsung Galaxy A5 and it may seem to have more features than last year’s Samsung flagship, the Galaxy S7.. It has more megapixels, with 16 squeezed into both the front and rear cameras, and a new-style USB-C socket. It’s also a classic example of why it pays to know a little more about the tech behind the figures, though.. For example, the Samsung Galaxy A5 has a distinctly mid-range chipset, the Samsung Exynos 7880. It’s reasonably close in power to the Snapdragon 617 used in phones like the Moto G4 Plus, even though the A5 is twice the price.. Similarly, its rear camera is worse than that of the many 12MP models around today, and also worse than some of the very best 13MP ones. Much cheaper phones use similar-quality hardware.. Where the Galaxy A5 excels is in making this conventional hardware work well. For example, the camera is very quick, with the same almost lag-free experience as seen in Samsung’s most expensive phones. And that performance is combined with a typically high-quality Full HD Super AMOLED display.. Tech obsessives can do better, but those who simply want a ‘nice’ phone that seems like a fairly high-end piece of hardware will appreciate the A5’s style.. The Galaxy A5 also has a comfortable 32GB of storage, and a microSD card slot to let you add to it (with cards of up to 256GB).. Like the 2016 version of the Samsung Galaxy A5, this phone is made of metal and glass. The front and back are glass, the sides aluminum with a color-matched finish.. Its glass is Gorilla Glass 4 rather than Gorilla Glass 5. It’s very tough, but where version five is designed to handle drops from shoulder height, version four is tested at 1 meter, or roughly waist height.. We’re using the black version, but Samsung also makes the Galaxy A5 in gold, light blue and pink. As the entire phone ends up one shade, there’s a certain plain simplicity to the handset that makes it less striking than the S7 family. However, it feels just as well-made. It’s also just as thin, at 7.9mm thick.. Samsung describes the design as “uniform all round”, and that’s on the money. The rear glass curves into the metal sides for a smoother feel too.. Like the iPhone 7 or Galaxy S7, the Samsung Galaxy A5 is of a size just about anyone should be able to get on with. It’s not a pocket-stretcher like most 5.5-inch phones, and the soft keys aren’t tricky to reach.. If you’re not switching from another Samsung phone, you may find the position of the soft keys takes some getting used to, though. The Samsung Galaxy A5 has separate light-up soft keys below the screen, but they’re flipped around: ‘back’ on the right, ‘recent apps’ on the left. This placement makes sense given that most people are right-handed and most use the back button more, but does take a day or two to feel right.. There are some other curiosities to the Samsung Galaxy A5 too. The SIM card and memory card slots are separate, one on the top, the other on the left side. You have to wonder whether Samsung could have crammed the two together, but does it matter? Not really.. The speaker placement is bizarre as well. There’s a main speaker at the top of the Samsung Galaxy A5’s right edge, when most phones have either front-facing drivers or one at the bottom. We’ve found you need to be a bit more careful about blocking the speaker if you’re just carrying the thing around listening to tunes or a podcast, but in other situations it actually works better than most.. It works for gaming because you won’t block it when holding the phone portrait, or on its side for those more involved two-hander titles.. The Samsung Galaxy A5’s fingerprint scanner is more conventional, similar to the Galaxy S7’s, it’s part of a clicky button below the screen.. This isn’t the fastest finger scanner going. It’s not instant, there’s a semi-quaver beat before it unlocks the phone, but we’ve only noticed this because we’ve used most of the fingerprint scanners out there. It is reliable, and doesn’t actually make you press the Home button to bring the Galaxy A5 out of standby.. The part that finishes off the Samsung Galaxy A5 hardware is water resistance. It’s certified to the IP68 standard, meaning you can submerge the phone in water of 1.5m depth for 30 minutes. Don’t get cocky and start dropping it in every body of water you come across, but you don’t have to worry about torrential rain or watching a bit of Netflix in the bath.. Given the choice we’d take the larger Galaxy S7 Edge as a media player, but the Samsung Galaxy A5’s top-quality screen is still a corker. It’s a 5.2-inch 1080p Super AMOLED display, using Samsung’s own panel tech.. Like other OLEDs, its black level and contrast are unbeatable, but a great LCD screen will generally get you purer-looking whites and slightly better sharpness. Thanks to a PenTile pixel structure, there’s the tiniest bit of fuzziness to the Samsung Galaxy A5’s display up-close, but it’s otherwise not light years away from the Galaxy S7’s screen.. As with that phone, you can choose from a bunch of color profiles that radically alter the screen’s personality. The standard Adaptive Display lets the OLED panel rip, with truly punchy oversaturated colors and cooler-skewed whites. It’s the equivalent of the mode you’ll see TVs use in high street shops.. Its AMOLED Cinema and AMOLED Photo mode calm those colors down while keeping a punchy look, and Basic brings tones all the way down to the sRGB color standard.. This may look undersaturated to many, or most, of you these days, but it’s like giving up on adding sugar to your coffee.. The neatest part of the Samsung Galaxy A5’s screen is its always-on display. When the phone is in standby, it shows the time, battery level, date and some little icons letting you know what sort of notifications you’ve received.. Alternatively, it can show the calendar, or one of a few specially-chosen images. You can also turn the feature off if you find it annoying.. As the Samsung Galaxy A5 uses an OLED screen, this seems to have very little impact on the battery. OLEDs have light-up pixels rather than a backlight, so displaying little bits of text doesn’t consume much power.. Next Page What's it like to use?.

Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) – Display. We’re expecting to see the new Samsung Galaxy A5 (2018) launched in the near future, so while last year’s A5 remains a great value phone, you might want to wait and see what Samsung has up its sleeve at MWC 2018 before making a final purchase decision.. The Samsung Galaxy A5 is the sort of phone that has me questioning why the vast majority of people should buy a flagship device. After all, when a £369.99 device ticks almost all of the right boxes, why pay more?. For the first time, Samsung has more convincingly brought the high-quality flagship DNA down to the mid-range, which makes the A5 the first non-flagship phone from the Korean company that’s easy to recommend.. If it wasn’t for some slight build quality issues, and the OnePlus 5T. representing a significant step up for not all that much more money, this could be the perfect mid-range phone..

Place the Samsung Galaxy A5 next to the Galaxy S7. and you’d be hard-pushed to immediately tell the difference between the two. Considering the Galaxy S7 was one of 2016’s best-looking phones, that’s strong praise.. The A5’s proportions are perfect; and that’s still a rarity in cheaper handsets. The majority of well-specced budget phones tend to have a 5.5-inch screen or bigger, but the 5.2-inch panel here reduces the size of the phone overall. The bezel is kept to a minimum and the ever so slightly curved back makes the device easy to hold in one hand.. There are even some design quirks that give the Galaxy A5 one over on its loftier Galaxy S7 sibling. The pastel colours – pink, blue and gold – are all subtle and attractive, while my review model takes a note from the Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus and is black all over. It’s a stealthy look that I’m sure will be one of the colour options available when the Galaxy S8 is announced.. I’m a huge fan of the Galaxy A5’s look, but I’m not so keen on the corners that have been cut to hit the lower price tag.. The back panel is a scratch-magnet and picks up grease and smudges within only seconds of use. There also appear to be some quality assurance issues, especially with my review unit. Following a week of use, the back panel has come slightly loose and there’s a noticeable sound whenever you apply pressure. It’s a small issue, but something you wouldn’t find on a flagship Samsung product.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

The headphone jack is on the bottom of the device, as it always should be, next to a USB Type-C port – the only on-sale Samsung phone with this reversible connection – and that’s it. In a strange move, Samsung has switched the speaker to the top side. This works surprisingly well, and although it isn’t a fantastic speaker, its position means it won’t be obstructed by your hand when you’re watching landscape video.. While the Samsung is rumoured to be ditching the physical home button and capacitive “Back” and “Overview” keys on the Galaxy S8, they’re still present on the A5.. It’s odd that the company has chosen to stick with them for so long, considering Android has very capable on-screen controls, but at least you get a fast fingerprint scanner on the front. It can’t quite match the Huawei and Honor handsets for sheer fingerprint scanning speed and accuracy, but it gets the job done.. The microSD card slot – which can handle up to 256GB cards, upping the base 32GB – combines with the nano-SIM on the top, while the clicky volume keys sit on the left. I’m a little annoyed that there’s no LED notification light on the front, but that’s something of a luxury at this price.. However, the biggest upgrade over the A5 from last year is the addition of an IP68 certification, which means your device will survive a dunk in a meter of water for around 30 minutes. While I wouldn’t advise you bathe with the phone, at least you know that your handset will recover from being caught in a rain shower.. There’s plenty to like about the AMOLED display on the Samsung Galaxy A5 – and, to my eyes at least – it’s just as good as the panel on the OnePlus 3.. The 1080p FHD resolution is perfectly acceptable at both this size and price, while the use of AMOLED, rather than LCD, results in providing extra oomph to bright colours.. Blacks are deep and inky, while reds and greens aren’t oversaturated. Samsung’s more budget-conscious AMOLED displays used to suffer from garish hues – but thankfully, this isn’t an issue any more. Brightness is good, too, with a strong range between the lowest and highest settings.. Samsung has added a number of software tweaks to alter the display. To be honest, though, I think the default “Adaptive display” setting is best. A colour slider lets you manually manage blues, greens and reds – but again, I feel it’s best left as it is.. The “Blue Light Filter” mode, which is similar to Night Shift on iOS, will remove certain blue light the comes off the screen, giving it an orangey tinge. You’re supposed to limit the amount of blue light you look at just before bed to aid sleep, and it’s a nice to see such a feature here.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

Following the unveiling, Samsung announced that they will sell up to 20 million smartphones, targeting Western and Eastern Europe , Africa , Asia and Latin America.

Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) vs Galaxy J7 (2017): How different are they really?. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) review: a mid-range phone with premium features. Samsung Galaxy J7 (2017) specs and overview. Samsung's strategy isn’t always easy to grasp. Although the Galaxy A5 (2017) and the J7 (2017) belong to two different families, they find themselves in competitive situations in many respects. A similar predecessor, but with some subtle differences in design. At 5.5 inches, the Galaxy J7 (2017) is 0.3 cm larger than the A5 (2017). A very different level of performance. Active On Display is available on both devices.. False debate over the software interface The same strength and effort to provide. The real difference between these two devices is the charging speed.. Pictures taken with the Galaxy A5 (2017). Pictures taken with the Galaxy J7 (2017). The logic of an illogical price. Things are pretty simple at Samsung: the S range launches a trend that the A and J ranges then follow. Consequently, both the A5 (2017) and J7 (2017) that were launched this year, are based on the Samsung Galaxy S7 design. They indisputably share a common ancestor (visually speaking), but in a more general manner, they follow a guideline found on all Samsung devices up to the Galaxy S8 model, which changed the trend. However, there are some differences between these two devices.. The Galaxy A5 (2017) is a little more elegant and has a better finish than the J7, but the performance of this entry-level smartphone should still be acknowledged, as it’s seen an evolution from the previous model. Plastic has made way to metal, a material that the A5 also proudly displays. So, what are the differences? The most obvious is obviously the size. Given the dimensions 152.5 x 74.8, the smartphone is slightly larger than the Galaxy A5, which is 146.1 mm long and 71.4 mm wide. This difference in screen size is very noticeable: the J7 is sized at 5.5 inches and the A5 at 5.2 inches.. Some of the differences aren’t visible at first glance. An example of this is the IP68 certification found on the A5 but not on the J7, which makes the phone vulnerable to water and dust. The microSD card, on the other hand, is available on both models.. The Galaxy A5 (2017) is a mid-range level smartphone, whereas the Galaxy J7 (2017) is an entry-level smartphone. This translates into their performance, even if it’s not always noticeable. The J7 is powerful enough to give you a satisfying experience for easy operation, in other words browsing, messaging etc. However, if you want to get a little more out of the phone and really experience the graphics at their best, some games will be a problem because the Exynos 7870 octacore processor and the Mali-T830 MP1 graphics chip in particular have trouble keeping up. The US model has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625, but we tested the Exynos model here. The Galaxy A5 (2017) has a Exynos 7880 processor and a Mali-T830 MP3 GPU (that is to say three times the power than on the J7).. Another big difference (that has to be pointed out) is that the internal memory on the J7 is only 16 GB, while the Galaxy A5 offers twice that. It’s worth mentioning as well that if you run out of space on either device, you can insert a microSD card of a maximum 256 GB. The amount of RAM is the same on both models.. Samsung has upgraded its devices, but performance is only of practical interest in an operating system, and regarding this, the two devices are quite different. The A5 (2017) is outdated, offering Android 6.0.1 by default, but it can of course be updated to Nougat. The J7 (2017) uses Android 7.0 by default. Updates are always a tricky issue, especially when it comes to flagships.. It's important to keep in mind that even though geeks like us care about software versions, many entry-level users don't, they just want a smartphone that can meet their (often simple) needs. They don't care if their device will be using Android P or not, so both devices are suitable. Other users, on the other hand, value the importance of updates (especially for security reasons), but unfortunately Samsung isn’t the fastest to offer them.. In any case, both devices will be using Android Oreo.. Updates are crucial for a smartphone, even if only for security.. The Galaxy A5 (2017) is renowned for its battery life. It is powered by a 3,000 mAh battery and will be able to survive an entire day without charging, thanks to various software configurations. To top it all off, you can recharge it in a very short amount of time: the battery will go from 0 to 100% in 1 hour and 20 minutes. The Galaxy J7 (2017) offers similar specifications, even though it has a bigger battery (3,600 mAh), you should be able to survive the day without too much trouble. The real difference between these two devices is the charging speed: you’ll find that charging isn’t fast on the J7, not even through the USB Type-C port.. In the world of smartphones, where prices skyrocket, it’s sometimes possible to find a good camera phone at the right price. While the J7 (2017) and A5 (2017) take decent photos given their range, they’re definitely not the phones’ strengths. With 13 MP with an aperture of f/1.7 and 16 MP with an aperture of f/1.9, the J7’s specs look better on paper. However, it did provide the most mixed performance. In both cases, it’s better to take photos in a well-lit environment in order to obtain quality photos.. Samsung Galaxy J7 (2017) technical specifications. 146.1 x 71.4 x 7.9 mm. 152.5 x 74.8 x 8 mm. 1920 x 1080 pixels (424 ppi). 1920 x 1080 pixels (401 ppi). HSPA, LTE, NFC, Dual-SIM , Bluetooth 4.1. The Galaxy A5 (2017) is available on Amazon for just $319 , while the Galaxy J7 (2017) can be had for $289. That means you can have a mid-range instead of an entry-level smartphone for only $30 more!. In short, if you have the budget and are prepared to opt for a smaller screen, it might be worth your while investing a few extra bucks to get a Galaxy A5 (2017). If you want a Samsung phablet for less than $300, the J7 is a good alternative.. Which of these two devices interests you most?. Where do they sell those phones at?. Well well here in India Xiaomi shines with its brilliant smartphones at very aggressive prices (very affordable). Considering the available options I will never buy a Samsung mid-range smartphone..

This score is based on our evaluation of 19. sources including reviews from users and the web's most trusted critics.. What's good Vibrant display Plenty of internal storage microSD support IP68 water and dust resistance Good camera Premium design. What's bad Low-light camera use requires a steady hand Older version of Android (6.0 Marshmallow). Samsung’s S series receives lots of love in the flagship arena. But their mid-tier A-series offers a similar experience at a lower price point. But when making a good mid-tier phone, it’s about cutting corners in the right places.. Does Samsung keep the Galaxy S magic without the price tag on their 2017 A5? Reviews are out and we’ve scoured them all so you don’t have to!. Reviewers were quick to point out how the phone resembles a Galaxy S6 or S7. It has that Samsung design look. You'll find rounded edges, a physical home button and the grilled loudspeaker. Yet, the A5's glass and metal design separates its from the budget bracket.. PhoneArena says, “Its glass-and-metal construction feels so seamlessly well put together, we’d forgive you if you mistake it for the flagship Galaxy S7 model. In the hand, the phone feels well balanced, with a nice heft to it.”. There’s even IP68 water and dust resistance to save your phone from those random drops in the sink, bathtub or pool.. The only complaints we found were for users of the black model. They found the finish a fingerprint magnet when paired with the darker color.. Heading around front, reviews of the 5.2-inch 1080p Super AMOLED screen are positive. While it’s not sharp enough for VR support, reviewers loved the vibrant colors, rich blacks and clear text. Know Your Mobile said, “For normal viewing this is nice and clear, and as we’ve come to expect from Samsung display tech the color gamut is fantastic, contrast is excellent, and the brightness levels are quite capable, though not the brightest on the market by any means.”. The 1.9GHz octa-core Exynos 7 processor keeps the screen stutter-free, even with the latest games. Reviews say the 3GB of RAM offers smooth multitasking. Some reviewers question if this will cause issues as apps continue to increase in complexity.. The Inquirer put the phone through a series of tests and declared it “more than capable of meeting most people's day-to-day smartphone performance needs.”. If you’ve found the TouchWiz UI frustrating in the past, reviews show that their new Grace UI is much less intrusive. It runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow with no sign of if Nougat or O will be offered. The phone’s 32GB of internal storage should be enough for most users. Need more space for your movies, music or other files? A microSD slot offers quick expansion up to 256GB of extra storage.. With 16MP cameras on both sides of the phone, reviewers loved the quality of both selfies and outdoor shots. Pocket Lint said, “The camera is capable of taking balance shots in good light with eye-pleasing sharpness and depth.” Some reviews noted blurry low-light action shots. But with a steady hand, image quality improved.. Reviews for the 3000mAh internal battery are mixed. Some reviewers applauded the phone for a two-day run on a single charge. Others mentioned needing to top off before the end of day one. If you’re a gamer or power user, the included fast charge adapter will net you a full charge in 1.5 hours.. Reviews for the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) are positive. Know Your Mobile summed up opinions well, saying, “It is a cohesive and well-thought-out package, and again, a big part of the appeal is getting premium aesthetics and build on the outside as much as the inside; this shouldn’t be the exclusive territory of flagships, and Samsung clearly understands that with the Galaxy A5.”. This handset stays true to the “Galaxy S7 Mini” nickname, although its screen is actually a bit larger. You feel that you’re getting a taste of Galaxy S7, maybe 70% of the experience or 80% tops, by spending a few Benjamins less. It’s a very good looking phone, with an extrem.... - Hansa Verma, The Indian Express. Samsung galaxy A5 (2017) scores on pretty much everything, except of course the processor. It sports a stunning design, great front and back cameras, and offers an average battery life. Galaxy A5 (2017) shouldn’t disappoint you if you are a regular user and do not play a lot of games of watch....

Samsung's A-series of mid-range Galaxy smartphones has been updated for 2017. This Galaxy A5 is the middle model, with the smaller, cheaper and less powerful Galaxy A3 2017 below it and the larger Galaxy A7 2017 above. The new Galaxy A5 shares many of the same specifications as the new Galaxy A7, and in our opinion offers much better value unless you particularly demand the larger screen. All three adopt the same design, one we've seen previously in the gorgeous Samsung Galaxy S7 .. You'll also like our Samsung Galaxy A5 2016 review. and Samsung Galaxy S7 review .. We've got hands-on reviews of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus .. As it did for the previous. Galaxy A-series update in 2016, Samsung has moved key features from its top-end Galaxy S-series down a rank. Galaxy A5 2017 is a very worthy update over its predecessor.. Key changes in the Galaxy A5 2017 include the new always-on display, IP68 waterproofing and a slightly higher-capacity battery. There has also been a significant bump in performance, now with a faster processor, an increase from 2- to 3GB of RAM and double the amount of storage with 32GB as standard. can now accept microSD cards up to 256GB, and it. also sees an improvement in the photography department with 16Mp cameras both front and rear (up from 5Mp and 13Mp respectively).. Then there's the new, significantly sleeker design.. The camera doesn't protrude so far at the rear, for example, and the new Galaxy A5 gains the same beautiful curves as the S7, now with curved glass at the front and tapered edges at the rear. The metal frame is thinner on the left- and right sides, without the previous model’s chiselled edge, and the glass rear wraps around further toward the front.. Interestingly, Samsung has gone above and beyond the Galaxy S7's improvements, which could be a sign of what's to come with the upcoming Galaxy S8. It has switched the Micro-USB port for reversible USB-C, and it's moved the speaker from the phone's bottom edge to a new, less likely to be muffled position at the top right edge above the power button.. But while it has clearly taken a lot of inspiration from the Galaxy S7, the Galaxy A5 2017 is still decidedly a mid-range phone. Performance is greatly improved but nowhere near that of the flagship, while the display. is lower-resolution and without a curved-screen option. The primary camera is arguably inferior, and the new Galaxy A5 lacks certain features of the Galaxy S7 such as the heart-rate scanner.. Because this is a brand-new phone, chances are right now you'll pay close to its RRP to get it SIM-free - and clearly the improvements to the Galaxy A5 have come at a price, since its RRP. has shot up from £319 to £399 , taking it away from the affordable mid-ground and dangerously close to flagship territory.. At this price there is a difference of just £47 between this Galaxy A5 and the Galaxy S7 (you can now buy the year-old Galaxy S7 SIM-free from Amazon UK. MobileFun , though, which supplied our Galaxy A5 for review. You will find it a little cheaper if you shop around online through the likes of Carphone Warehouse , which at the time of writing lists the Galaxy A5 2017 at £369.99. The extra £30 discount could be enough to sway you over the Galaxy S7, but it all depends on how tight is your budget.. As with all Samsung phones, we expect the price to rapidly drop - usually by as much as 20 percent within the first few months. At which point the Galaxy A5 2017 would offer better value, though brand-new today it just doesn't represent a good deal. when compared to the high-end Galaxy S7, which we still regard as the best Android phone on the market .. The alternative, of course, is to get the Galaxy A5 on a contract. While monthly prices for the Galaxy S7 (with no upfront charge) start at £30.99, you can get this Galaxy A5 from £27.50 per month. That seems to be a relatively small saving, but over the course of 24 months it works out just short of £85.. (Browse more Galaxy A5 2017 deals at Carphone Warehouse .). MobileFun supplied our Galaxy A5 2017 with a handful of cases to protect it from damage. sells a wide range of Galaxy A5 2017 cases and covers, chargers, car holders, screen protectors and other accessories.. It particularly recommended to us the official Samsung S View Premium Cover Case (£34.99), which comes in black, blue, pink and gold to match the available colours of the Galaxy A5, the Olixar FlexiShield Samsung Galaxy A5 Gel Case. (£4.99) and the Olixar Ultra-Thin Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 Case (£5.99), covering a range of styles and budgets. The latter is not only cheap but as close as you'll get to invisible should you want to show off the Galaxy A5's gorgeous design.. If you've ever played with a Galaxy S7 then you will know roughly what the Galaxy A5 looks and feels like. In our office at least, we found the tendency was to think of it as a smaller Galaxy S7, which is crazy since it's actually larger - albeit only just.. The reason for this is the ever so slightly larger screen - 5.2in against the S7's 5.1in. The Galaxy S7 is both shorter and narrower than the A5, measuring 142x70mm against its 146.1x71.4mm, although with matching 3,000mAh batteries inside both are 7.9mm thick. That's not at all bad for a mid-range phone such as this.. The screen might be larger, but it has significantly fewer pixels. The Galaxy S7 has a Quad-HD resolution of 2560x1440 pixels, turning in a screen density of 577ppi, while the full-HD resolution of this 1920x1080-pixel panel works out at just 424ppi. We say 'just'; it's actually a very sharp screen (sharper than that of any iPhone, for example), simply inferior to that of the Galaxy S7.. We can hardly complain about the display, though, which uses our personal favourite SuperAMOLED tech. SuperAMOLED produces rich, vibrant, saturated colours with very deep blacks and dazzling whites. Viewing angles are excellent, and the display is very bright and clear - a pleasure to use. Another plus: SuperAMOLED places less of a hit on battery life than many competing technologies.. >> Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 review continues on the next page.

Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) Smartphone Review. Daniel Schmidt ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 02/14/2017. Android ARM Touchscreen. The Galaxy A5 series now enters the third round and has to keep its ground when fighting in the strong mid-range. More power, bigger storage, and water and dust protection are to help here. The test will show whether this will suffice.. Â» Multimedia , Â» Gaming , Â» Lightweight Gaming Â» Budget Office , Â» Business , Â» Workstations Â» Subnotebooks , Â» Ultrabooks , Â» Convertibles. Top 10 under 300 Euros , Â». Best Notebooks for University Students Â». Top Windows alternatives to Apple's MacBook series Â». Â» Tablets , Â» Windows Tablets Â» Smartphones. For the original German review, see here .. Samsung seems to have understood that the mid-range priced at around 400 Euros (~$423) is a highly competitive sector with really good smartphones and has thus treated the new Galaxy A5 (SM-A520F) to an extensive update. The good news first: The price remains stable at an RRP of 420 Euros (~$444).. A new Exynos processor operates underneath the glass and metal casing. It can fall back on a generous 3 GB of working memory. The integrated graphics card provides a higher performance and should render games better on the classy Full HD panel. The internal storage is now twice the size of the former Galaxy A5 (2016). Samsung has also strongly increased the megapixel count of the cameras. Furthermore, the battery is now a bit bigger. dust and water resistance, is unique in this category. The smartphone comes with good prerequisites to again catch up to its competitors.. Undeniably, OnePlus is the leader in this price range thanks to high-end specifications. However, Huawei's Nova Plus , Honor's 8 , ZTE's Axon 7 , and Lenovo's Moto Z Play are also strong competitors for the Galaxy A5 (2017).. Samsung Exynos 7880 ARM Mali-T830 MP3.

Like the predecessor , aluminum and glass are used in Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2017). The latter is Corning Gorilla Glass 5. Its looks closely follow those of the S series. The smartphone is now also four grams heavier and a bit thicker. The manufacturer states a height of 7.9 millimeters, which our measurements confirm. The camera no longer protrudes out of the casing and closes flush with the rear so that the handset can be placed evenly on a table.. A drawback of the glass surface is that the smartphone tends to slip away slowly on slanted surfaces. However, the handset can be held securely. Warping attempts do not impress the Galaxy A5 and only leads to an occasional cracking noise. Pressure on the screen does not have any consequences thanks to the OLED technology. The gaps are also narrow and even; only the transition between the glass and metal bezel in the corners has to be criticized as it is a bit irregular. However, this does not affect the feel.. The battery is non-removable so the user cannot replace it. Two dedicated slots for a micro-SD card and nano-SIM are present. A dual-SIM model does not exist. This means that the Galaxy A5 is now sealed against dust and that it is resistant to prolonged submersion in fresh water.. Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2017) is available in four colors: black, gold, blue (Brandeis Blue) and pink (Martian Pink).. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. It is possible to expand the storage of Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2017) via a micro-SD card, but the additional capacity can only be used to store media data. Applications cannot be moved to or directly installed on it. It is not possible to format it as internal storage, either.. Samsung has made cutbacks in details. A radio receiver is not installed. Although the USB port supports the latest Type-C design, it still only offers the 2.0 transmission standard and no longer supports OTG.. The A5 also offers Wi-Fi Direct, Ant+, NFC, and Bluetooth 4.2.. Lower edge: audio jack, microphone, USB. Google's Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow operating system is preloaded on Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2017). The manufacturer covers it with its own Grace UI. The still relatively new user interface (UI) was first used in the Galaxy Note 7. Samsung users will soon accommodate, but users who are used to stock Android will sometimes certainly be relieved about the search function. An update to Android 7.1 Nougat is confirmed but a fixed date has not yet been announced.. At test time, security updates from December 2016 were installed..

Samsung has installed a better modem for mobile network reception into the Galaxy A5 (2017). Although the maximum downstream of 300 MBit/s is identical with Cat. 6, the theoretical upstream speed has doubled to 100 MBit/s. The frequency configuration is also really good and should ensure good reception in all European countries. US travelers will, however, miss Band 12 (700 MHz) among other ones. The reception during our test in a big city using the O 2 and Vodafone mobile networks was inconspicuous.. The smartphone connects to Wi-Fi networks in the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac standards, but it does not support any MIMO technologies. The Galaxy A5 presented a low attenuation of -30 to -40 dBm in the Wi-Fi access point's vicinity - which are good rates. Generally, the handset's reception qualities are decent but rapidly start decreasing at a distance of approximately 10 meters. Video streaming is then accompanied by interruptions and the attenuation is very high with -80 to -100 dBm. Our measurements with our Linksys EA8500 reference router confirm the A5's good transmission speeds. Only OnePlus' 3T defeats it in the comparison field..

Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2017) uses the GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou satellite networks for localization. We were tracked within a few seconds outdoors, but a bit more patience was needed indoors near a window. The accuracy of at most seven meters is not particularly exact. We took the smartphone on a bike ride to examine this more closely.. The A5 has to compete against Garmin's Edge 500 bike computer. The smartphone does not refresh the points as frequently and consequently also deviates more from the driven route. It shortens the route by approximately 2.3% compared with Garmin's device. This is still a decent performance in total and should be absolutely sufficient for amateur athletes.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2017) has a decent call quality. We could always understand our contact well and we were also almost always relatively intelligible. The microphone only sometimes reduced the volume. The smartphone's microphones exhibit a similar performance as the included in-ear headset. The speaker is also well-suitable for quiet environments.. Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2017) offers a 16-MP camera on both the front and rear. This promises high resolution, in particular for selfies. Furthermore, both lenses have a nominal aperture of f/1.9 and should therefore be very light sensitive. In case of the front-facing camera, it is also noticed that the lens captures a lot of light with the purpose of making the photos as bright as possible. A Beauty Mode that narrows the face and enlarges the eyes via a soft focus is also present for selfies. The photos are quite good, but we primarily missed an autofocus. In return, the release speed is very fast.. The rear-facing camera has an autofocus alongside an LED flash. Daylight photos are very balanced and exhibit a relatively large scope of dynamics that is also owed to the well-functioning HDR Mode. The definition is good but decreases quite soon especially toward the edges. Particularly bright objects tend to overexpose and details are lost. Photos taken in low-light conditions are also still good and the noise is kept within limits compared with the competition.. Videos are recorded at a maximum of Full HD (1920x1080 pixels, 30 FPS). The quality is good, but support for higher frame rates and Ultra HD should be given in this price range.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. ColorChecker: The target color is displayed in the lower half of every patch. We additionally take photos of our test chart and the X-Rite ColorChecker Passport under defined light conditions. The ColorChecker presents a very good white balance. However, the other grayscales are a bit too bright. The darker color tones are saturated more strongly, which leads to a brilliant contrast. Bright colors are a bit too pale, though.. The test chart shows that the sharpness could be somewhat better despite the comparatively high resolution. Fine details are lost even in the center in maximum zoom. In return, the color graduations are relatively clear and slight reproduction errors are only produced in dark lettering on a dark background. Again, it is visible that the image sharpness deteriorates quite soon toward the edges.. Samsung ships its Galaxy A5 (2017) with a modular power supply that has a nominal output of up to 16.83 watts (9.0 V, 1.87 A; 5.0 V, 2.0 A), a USB cable, SIM-card tool, an in-ear headset, a quick-start guide, and some leaflets concerning safety, warranty, and Internet usage. The manufacturer optionally offers a matching cover (starts at 15 Euros, ~$15) and screen protector (15 Euros, ~$15) in its shop .. Samsung includes a two-year warranty on its product; the accessories are covered for six months and the battery for one year.. The capacitive touchscreen in Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2017) detects up to five touch points at the same time. The surface of the Corning Gorilla Glass 5 has superb gliding qualities. Inputs are implemented quickly and accurately. The keyboard layout that Samsung uses is very clearly arranged, but it only offers small keys that often lead to typos. When preferred, downloading an alternative keyboard from the Play Store is uncomplicated.. The physical buttons have a high-quality feel and crisp pressure point alongside a short drop. The home button also makes a good impression, and it functions very reliably just like both neighboring sensor buttons. A fingerprint scanner is integrated into the home button. However, it is not quite as reliable and its identification rate is not as good as the modules in the devices by Huawei or OnePlus. We often had to place the finger on the surface several times, and sometimes we had to wait half a minute before we could try again. The scanner also had problems with moist fingers and denied access.. The panel in Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2017) seems unchanged compared with its predecessor. It is still 5.2-inches and uses Samsung's Super AMOLED technology. The Full HD resolution (1920x1080 pixels) ensures a high pixel density of 424 PPI. Since the screen can shine even more brightly when the ambient light sensor is enabled, we measured it using maximum brightness on a white image. The brightness differences to the 2016 model only seem vast because last year's model was measured without the light sensor. When the sensor in the A5 (2017) is disabled, the OLED panel only achieves a maximum of 340 cd/mÂ² in the center. The review sample achieves up to 660 cd/mÂ² in the screen center in the APL measurement, i.e. evenly distributed bright and dark areas. The illumination of 93% is also very homogeneous.. Since it is an OLED panel, every pixel can be illuminated individually. Thus, black areas are really black. This results in a theoretically infinite contrast ratio.. The Galaxy A5 offers a blue light filter for the night, and the Display-Always-On known from the Galaxy S7 Edge is also onboard.. 567 cd/m² 542 cd/m² 530 cd/m² 549 cd/m² 539 cd/m² 525 cd/m² 548 cd/m² 552 cd/m² 527 cd/m². 93 % Center on Battery: 660. cd/m²) ΔE Color 1.6 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 1.5 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.28.

A peculiarity of OLED panels is their use of pulse-width modulation (PWM) for brightness control. Sensitive users could perceive flickering, and eye problems or headaches could result in low frequencies. PWM is also used in Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2017). The amplitude curve already displays visible peaks at a brightness of approximately 93% (manual settings), and the frequency of 250 Hz is relatively low. The frequency even drops to around 60 Hz beyond that, but the amplitude curve is very linear, making problems unlikely. The frequency fluctuates between 119 and 231 Hz in minimum brightness, which is a very low 1.77 cd/mÂ².. Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM detected 250 Hz. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. The display backlight flickers at 250. Hz is relatively low, so sensitive users will likely notice flickering and experience eyestrain at the stated brightness setting and below.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. As usual, Samsung offers a color profile manager in its higher-priced models that are set to Adaptive Display by default. We examined the three manual settings Basic, Movie and Photo with a photospectrometer and CalMAN analysis software. The first thing that is noticed is that the profile Basic delivers the most accurate rates, but it also only uses the sRGB color space. On the other hand, Movie and Photo are calibrated according to the larger AdobeRGB color space. It is striking that the bluish tint is hardly present any longer in the Movie profile; this was a bit more prominent in the Galaxy S7 / Edge .. The screen's color accuracy is outstanding. An average DeltaE of 1.5 is recorded in the grayscale levels, without significant peaks. Even the worst rate of dE 2.4 remains below 3, and thus the shift from the target will be as good as invisible to the human eye. The positive impression continues in the mixed colors as the colors all remain below dE3. Hardly any other manufacturer provides such an accurate color reproduction even among the high-end competition.. Grayscale (Profile: Basic, target color space: Adobe RGB).

This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2017) does not show any weaknesses outdoors. The bright screen with its extremely high contrast never finds its limits under cloudy conditions. The content should still be well-legible despite the reflective screen even in sunlight. Unfortunately, we could not test this since heavy clouds concealed the sun. However, the fingerprints on the screen are noticed immediately in bright ambient light.. The viewing-angle stability of Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2017) is good. A slight greenish haze covers the panel only at very flat viewing angles. The smartphone does not suffer from ghosting effects or clouding.. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017): Viewing-angle stability. We criticized the somewhat weak performance of the SoC installed in Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2016). The manufacturer has also made improvements here and now relies on the proprietary Exynos 7880. It is an octa-core processor that exclusively uses Cortex A53 cores that clock up to 1.9 GHz. An ARM Mali-T830 MP3 graphics unit and 3 GB of LPDDR3 working memory are also installed.. Thus, the Galaxy A5 (2017) is built on solid performance that is situated in the mid-range. The CPU's pure performance is slightly above that of a Snapdragon 625 that is used in the Nova Plus and Moto Z Play. The performance of the graphics unit is even higher than that of an Adreno 506. While both systems are still on par in the OpenGL ES 2.0 test, the ARM GPU is 45 to 86% faster in the more demanding OpenGL ES 3.x test. However, it cannot compete with the strong Adreno 530 in the Axon 7 or OnePlus 3T .. Unfortunately, the review sample did not manage to use this speed advantage in the system performance. While it could still keep up well in AnTuTu, the A5 only manages to outperform the Axon 7 in PCMark. The Grace UI lets the user feel this with minor stutters in routine use. It got really jerky when opening the Upday news website on the home screen.. AnTuTu v6 - Total Score (sort by value) Samsung Galaxy A5 2017.

Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2017) offers 32 GB of eMMC flash memory. Approximately 23 GB is available after initial use, and when all updates have been downloaded this even shrinks to just 20.2 GB. Uninstalling the little bloatware retrieves an additional 300 MB of storage. The flash memory's speed is the slowest in the comparison field and can also only be called slow otherwise.. We tested the micro-SD slot with our Toshiba Exceria Pro M401 reference card. The smartphone does not show any weaknesses here and delivers relatively good rates although the memory card's potential is not exhausted..

The ARM Mali-T830 MP3 graphics unit provides a decent mid-range performance and supports the latest OpenGL ES 3.2 standard, but not the Vulkan API. Thus, all games from Google's Play Store are playable, and even more demanding games like Asphalt 8 run in high details. However, minor stutters might occasionally be noticed then. This is also true for Dead Trigger 2 that also seems to have a frame rate limitation. Simple games, such as Bubble Witch 3 Saga , run smoothly.. The hardware in the Galaxy A5 does not give reason for complaint. The touchscreen and sensors do an impeccable job. The speaker's good positioning has to be especially highlighted here. Furthermore, the Game Launcher known from the S series is also onboard.. The surface temperatures of Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2017) stay relatively low even during permanent load and do not surpass 34 Â°C.

In the easier T-Rex test (OpenGL ES 2.0), the review sample's performance drops by about 20% after 12 runs. The performance loss is on a similar level in the more demanding Manhattan test.

The at first seemingly strange positioning of the mono speaker in Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2017) turns out to be well considered. The device can be placed on a table, held in portrait or landscape mode without covering it. The speaker's quality is sufficient for occasionally watching a short video or sampling music pieces. The emphasis of the higher mids at around 1 kHz creates a relatively dominant sound impression that is not particularly balanced.. The audio jack offers a low-noise sound reproduction when using the right headphone. The included in-ear headset does not do a particularly good job here. It produces audible noise and the low tones are too prominent. Although this simulates a powerful sound, it does not convince in terms of balance and accuracy. Furthermore, each earbud has to be pushed deeply into the ear canals for achieving the best possible result.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 31.6 41.1 25 25.4 40 31 25.3 36.7 40 32.9 36 50 33.6 35.6 63 31.6 30.6 80 28.4 32.9 100 27 33.8 125 20.8 41.7 160 22 44.4 200 21.3 48.4 250 20.8 50.5 315 21.2 56.6 400 19.4 62.5 500 19.5 66.2 630 17.7 66.1 800 17.9 74.2 1000 17.8 77.3 1250 17.3 74.3 1600 17.4 73.8 2000 16.7 71.8 2500 17.2 69.3 3150 18.2 69.5 4000 17.9 66.5 5000 17.6 61.4 6300 17.7 55.8 8000 17.8 54.5 10000 17.9 59.9 12500 18.1 52.2 16000 18.2 49.5 SPL 30 83 N 1.3 50.1 median 17.9 Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 median 61.4 Delta 1.3 9.5 31.6 42 25.4 37.6 25.3 31.4 32.9 36.3 33.6 51.7 31.6 34.3 28.4 31.7 27 36.9 20.8 26 22 29.9 21.3 41.8 20.8 53.9 21.2 59.4 19.4 63.6 19.5 67.4 17.7 66.1 17.9 70.1 17.8 69.8 17.3 73.4 17.4 74.6 16.7 76.7 17.2 77.2 18.2 78.9 17.9 79.6 17.6 76 17.7 72.9 17.8 73.2 17.9 71.1 18.1 64.5 18.2 57.2 30 87.4 1.3 68.4 median 17.9 Huawei Nova Plus median 69.8 1.3 10.2 31.6 35.7 25.4 34.6 25.3 29.3 32.9 28.4 33.6 37.1 31.6 34.7 28.4 29.5 27 29.7 20.8 33 22 43.2 21.3 49.6 20.8 56 21.2 57.4 19.4 59.3 19.5 66.5 17.7 68.5 17.9 74.4 17.8 75.1 17.3 77.3 17.4 78.3 16.7 78.4 17.2 78.2 18.2 78.2 17.9 76.1 17.6 75 17.7 73.5 17.8 73.7 17.9 74 18.1 75.2 18.2 69 30 88.1 1.3 72.7 median 17.9 Lenovo Moto Z Play median 73.7 1.3 9.2 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Frequency diagram in comparison (checkboxes above can be turned on/off!). The power consumption measurements of Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2017) are convincing and have been improved greatly compared with the predecessor. The smartphone drains 1.36 watts from the outlet with the screen brightness set to maximum manually. This rate increases to 1.88 watts when the ambient light sensor is enabled. The A5 consumes 4.81 watts during full load with enabled sensor.. The review sample is also pleasingly efficient in standby mode. The consumption climbs to 0.25 watts when the Display-Always-On is used, which is also a good rate. The power supply's internal consumption is also pleasingly low. It settles to 0.006 watts when the handset is not connected.. Since the Galaxy A5 (2017) supports Quick Charge, it does not need long to recharge. The battery reaches a capacity of 23% after 15 minutes, and it is charged to 43% after half an hour. 80% is reached after 56 minutes, and it is completely recharged in 90 minutes..

We already expected good runtimes just in view of the low power consumption. However, the Galaxy A5 (2017) even surpasses this and presents a superb battery life. This is likely mainly due to the medium energy-saving mode that was enabled in the test using an adapted screen brightness (150 cd/mÂ²). Only the Moto Z Play achieves better runtimes in the comparison field, but it also has a much bigger battery.. We also performed the PCMark Work 2.0 Battery Life Test (150 cd/mÂ²) that simulates everyday use based on the benchmark.

In review: Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 (SM-A520F). The new 2017 version of Samsung's Galaxy A5 (SM-A520F) is in no way inferior to its competition - the Korean manufacturer delivers a really good smartphone. Its successful design and, above all, its outstanding battery life are convincing. Although the performance does not set standards, it is very appropriate for the price range. Only the Grace UI does not run quite smoothly everywhere, but it is an improvement over its TouchWiz predecessor. The cameras shoot good photos although we would have wished for a better configuration for the video function. The dust and water resistance, which is also found in Samsung's premium models, is unique in this price range. However, users who react sensitively to PWM-flickering, as is the case here, should consider this when choosing a smartphone.. Samsung has improved the most important points in its new Galaxy A5 and primarily convinces with its outstanding battery life.. The Galaxy A5 (2017) does not exhibit any major shortcomings, but small details, such as the slow storage, the lack of OTG and dual-SIM, might certainly be the decisive features for some buyers..

Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) review: The Samsung Galaxy A5 has already proven its worth in previous years, with last year’s model landing a full five-star review, but does the 2017 refresh still make for a winning recipe?. The A Series has always been about distilling down what makes the company’s top-tier handsets so desirable and repackaging that into a more affordable handset. With that in mind it should come as no surprise that 2017’s A5 bears more than a passing resemblance to Samsung’s current flagship, the Galaxy S7 .. It looks and feels like a high-end device; a lightly pillowed glass front meeting with a textured and colour-matched metal frame, whilst the phone’s glass back curves off at the sides, just like the S7’s, making for a comfortable fit and feel in the hand. The back also debuts a primary camera that doesn’t protrude, a first for the A5 family.. 2017’s A Series also all adopt USB-C, so you now have the convenience of that reversible connector, along with IP68 dust and water resistance, as found on last year’s model. There’s a fingerprint sensor mounted into the physical home button (again, like the S7) and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack to accompany the buds that come in-box, whilst the loudspeaker is interestingly positioned high on the right side of the phone.. It seems odd that we haven’t seen phones use this layout already, as despite still only offering a single driver, it’s now better positioned for enjoying media whilst holding the phone in a landscape orientation, as it minimises the risk of becoming obscured by a hand.. The 5.2-inch Full HD Super AMOLED panel is wonderfully crisp and colourful, with next to no colour or contrast distortion and strong overall brightness. Paired with a blue light filter that’s readily accessible from the phone’s quick settings, it’s more than a match for the similarly specced screen found on the Honor 8 .. Its size also ensures that it’s well balanced for both comfort and media consumption, whilst a one-handed mode is baked into the user experience to alleviate the challenge of trying to pull down the notifications shade single-handedly.. Another talent that 2017’s A5 has borrowed from Samsung’s 2016 flagship is the always-on display feature, which is customisable to show your calendar, the date and/or time when the phone is locked, along with icons relating to unread notifications, all in a clear, glanceable format.. Audio quality from the aforementioned loudspeaker is also wonderfully clear, even if it’s unsurprisingly a touch lacking in both loudness and bass.. Just as with last year’s model, this new A5 doesn’t come running the latest build of Android, but instead the marginally older Marshmallow release. Whilst it’ll no doubt get an update in the near future, Samsung has still ensured that it feels like a current-gen device by implementing features like split screen multitasking, which would otherwise be found natively on Android 7.0 Nougat.. Beyond that the company’s made some other small, but meaningful tweaks to its own already approachable overlay that make for easier navigation and customisation of the software experience found on the A5.. Long pressing icons on a home screen, for example, offers new functionality, like sleeping apps, by which they are deactivated until you next use them, and the ability to uninstall directly from the same menu. You can also pull in a native Theme Store more readily for easier personalisation and software experience as a whole just feels more cohesive than ever before.. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017): Tips, Tricks and Hidden Features. The 2017 Galaxy A5 and A7 are the only two devices on the market to currently sport Samsung’s own Exynos 7880, accompanied by 3GB of RAM. Whilst the A5 doesn’t appear to score particularly high with benchmarks like Antutu, it seems more than capable of handling everyday tasks, the aforementioned multitasking and 3D games with aplomb, with buttery smooth animations no matter how fast you swipe. 32GB of internal storage is the least we’d expect on a mid-ranger in 2017, but expandability means that you can also throw in microSD cards up to 256GB, so there really aren’t any concerns on our part about running out of space with the A5.. As for battery life, the 3000mAh cell should see you through a day of intensive use without issue and just shy of a day and a half for muggles with more conventional usage, whilst the adaptive fast charger that comes with the phone is able to juice it back up in just over an hour and 15 minutes.. Samsung’s created a focussed photographic experience in 2017’s A5 that looks as though the company’s been paying attention to what its customers are looking for in a mid-range smartphone snapper.. You can see full resolution photo samples from this article here .. The 16-megapixel primary sensor produces pleasingly colourful imagery in all manner of conditions, including low light, but can struggle in high contrast scenarios. HDR mode is the perfect remedy for that problem, if you can handle the slower shutter, whilst the 16-megapixel front-facing camera is good, even if it doesn’t capture flawless detail to the degree of the phone’s main snapper.. On the video front 1080p HD recording is impressively fast to manage colour and contrast, but falls down with image stability as no OIS means it can’t iron out hand shake or motion if you’re walking around.. The highlight has to be the intuitive, fluid new camera interface, which relies on swipes to jump between its primary features, including live filters, a food mode and manual control via pro mode.. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) camera review .. It’s not a perfect mid-range phone, but it consistently hits all the key notes you’d want a device in its. class to, and it does so very well. It also does an excellent job of distilling down some of the main draws of the Galaxy S7 flagship, so if you’re looking for a similar experience by way of a premium design, fingerprint sensor and IP68 certification without the same price tag, then the 2017 revision of the A5 certainly delivers.. The one barrier all current phones in the £300 to £400 region are unable to avoid right now is the might of OnePlus and its current flagship the 3T , which is only £30 more than Samsung’s new mid-ranger and brings flagship-class optics, performance and battery technology to the table, albeit at the expense of that water resistance..

Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) smartphone was first unveiled in January this year. The smartphone is priced at Rs 28,990 in India. Samsung has been the largest smartphone vendor in India thanks to its strong offline presence and a vast portfolio of devices across various price-raia. Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) was launched along side Galaxy A5 (2017) as well. We used Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017), and here’s what we think of the device in our review.. Samsung Galaxy A5 (20017) specifications: 5.2-inch Full HD (1080p) | 1.9GHz octa-core Exynos 7880 processor | 3GB RAM + 32GB storage (expandable) | 16MP rear camera + 16MP front camera | 3,000mAh | Android 6.0. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) India price: Rs 28,990. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) Design, Display review. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) has a stunning design, thanks to a glass back and rounded corners. The phone easily fits in your hand, despite a 5.5-inch display. The glass back is curved around the two sides, and seamlessly merges into the display, which gives Galaxy A5 (2017) a flawless and stylish look. Metal frames run along the edges, while the front and the back are covered with a 2.5D glass.. A 3.5mm headset jack and a USB Type-C charging port are placed at the bottom, while SIM tray is at the top. Volume rocker keys and power button are on the left and right side respectively. The rear camera lens is a small squarish unit placed at the top center with LED flash on the right. The fingerprint scanner is embedded into the home button, and it was quick to unlock the device each time I tried. Remember to use Galaxy A5 (2017) with a cover because firstly, the back is prone to fingerprint and smudges. Also the glass-metal body is likely to get cracked easily even with the slightest fall.. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) performance review. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) scores highly on performance thanks to Exynos 7880 processor coupled with 3GB RAM. It didn’t give me a reason to complain while I was multitasking, and there were no noticeable lags while opening apps. The smartphone can handle graphic-heavy games like Asphalt-8 really well, and the phone doesn’t get too hot, which is great.. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) camera review. Camera in Galaxy A5 (2017) is the second most likeable feature for me. Of course, the first is its design. The 16MP rear shooter is capable of capturing some stunning shots in bright sunlight. The pictures have great amount of detail, and colours come out accurately as well. The camera has problems focussing on objects in low-light. The results aren’t quite great, given the pictures had noise in them.. I really liked the camera UI, which allows me to switch between rear and front camera by swiping up and down, and open modes by swiping right. It comes with Pro, Panorama, hyperlapse, HDR, Night, and Food mode, apart from Auto mode.. The front camera produces equally good results, and colour reproduction is close to real. It comes with selfie, wide selfie and night modes. There are various basic and beauty filters to choose from, available when you swipe left. The feature is great for people who usually edit their pictures before posting on social media.. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) software, UI review. Frankly, we expected Android Nougat at the very least, especially at this price-point. Samsung has added a couple of customisations of its own, which a lot of non-Samsung users will take time getting used to. Galaxy A5 (2017) features Always-on display, which is appealing, except when you’re sleeping and the phone is kept besides you. Plus it comes with Samsung pay integration, which promises to make transactions simpler since it is NFC-based. However, I didn’t really have the chance to use this feature.. The battery is Galaxy A5 (2017) will easily last for a day on moderate usage, but don’t expect the same if you are a heavy user. I charged my phone at the beginning of the day every day, but had to charge it again at night on days I used the device extensively. This includes making calls, watching videos, browsing Facebook etc, messaging, and listening to music. Since Galaxy A5 (2017) uses a USB Type-C port, a charging cable is a must for late-night parties or movies.. Samsung galaxy A5 (2017) scores on pretty much everything, except of course the processor. It sports a stunning design, great front and back cameras, and offers an average battery life. Galaxy A5 (2017) shouldn’t disappoint you if you are a regular user and do not play a lot of games of watch a lot of videos on your device. Coming to options in the same price-range, there’s OnePlus 3T which runs Snapdragon 821, Oppo F3 Plus which you can consider..
