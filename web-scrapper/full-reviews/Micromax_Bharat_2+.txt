Micromax, the Indian smartphone manufacturer launched two new budget phones priced under Rs. 3,000 to focus on increasing demand of VoLTE phones, thanks to the Reliance Jio network. The two phones named Bharat 1 & Bharat 2 where the latter is a smartphone but the Bharat 1 promisingly remains a feature phone to come with VoLTE & to be priced around Rs. Lets talk about the Bharat 2 for the moment.. It features a very basic design & build material which is justified for the price. Comes with a plastic body all around with a 4-inch display that has a resolution of 800x480 pixels giving it a pixel density of 233PPI. You do not get any sort of protection over the display.. On the inside, Bharat 2 sports a Spreadtrum SC9832 quad core chipset clocked at 1.3GHz & is combined with 512MB RAM. The RAM might not be sufficient for smooth functioning, however, if you are looking for the most basic purpose, it should suffice. On the software front, it comes with a Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box with no details on update schedule.. You get a very basic set of cameras with the Bharat 2. The rear is a 2MP camera & the front has got a 0.3MP camera for video calling needs, might not be good for selfies. To store all the data you get around 4GB of internal space that can be expanded up to 32GB via a MicroSD card.. Connectivity being the primary function & motive of this device, it supports all major bands to work with all networks in India. Also, as mentioned it comes with 4G VoLTE to support Reliance Jio network. And to power the Bharat 2, it comes with a 1300mAh battery that can be user replaced & does not sound good enough to last through the day.. Swipe Konnect Star LYF Flame 7.

New Delhi March 20, 2017 UPDATED 14:53 IST READ LATER. A few days ago we heard about the Bharat 1 and the Bharat 2, two affordable phones that Micromax is working on. The Bharat 1 is a feature phone with support for 4G LTE -- think Jio -- built in it. The Bharat 2, however, is an Android smartphone, again with 4G LTE support built in.. In terms of specifications, the phones looks somewhat underpowered but then it wasn't going to be a speed demon anyways. It is meant to be a device that will allow people to quickly and in somewhat affordable way to connect to the high-speed 4G connection. Also, it will only be sold in offline channels, which is also somewhat of an obvious move considering the fact that the phone is primarily made for people in small towns and rural India.. A few days ago we heard about the Bharat 1 and the Bharat 2, two affordable phones that Micromax is working on. The Bharat 1 is a feature phone with support for 4G LTE -- think Jio -- built in it. The Bharat 2, however, is an Android smartphone, again with 4G LTE support built in.. The Bharat 1 will sell for Rs 1,999 and the Bharat 2 carries a price tag of Rs 2,999. Today, India Today tech can reveal the hardware details of the Bharat 2.. The Bharat 2, which will be launched first and in the next two weeks, has a 4-inch screen with WVGA (848 x 480 pixels) resolution. The rest of the hardware is fairly basic. The phone has a 2-megapixel rear camera and a 0.3 megapixel front camera. It also has 512MB RAM and 4GB internal storage. The phone has GPS, a 1300 mAH battery, support for LTE, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The phone will use Android Marshmallow as its operating system.. The Bharat 1 and Bharat 2 are the phones through which Micromax hopes to ride the 4G wave in India. The price of data after the entry of Jio has crashed in India and all telecom operators are heavily promoting their 4G services. This push towards 4G will benefit phone companies that have a few budget 4G phones in their product line-up.. Also Read: Micromax to launch Rs 1,999 4G feature phone and Rs 2,999 4G Android phone. At the same time, Bharat 1 and Bharat 2 are also an attempt by Micromax to cover a broader range of price points, a strategy that the company is hoping to unveil soon as it prepares to launch its most expensive Android phone yet.

The Micromax Bharat 2 Plus comes with a 4-inch WVGA display, 1.3 GHz quad-core processor, 1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of storage (expandable via microSD), 5-megapixel main camera and 2-megapixel selfie unit on the front.. Dimensions: 4.92 x 2.50 x 0.43 inches (125 x 63.4 x 10.8 mm). Weight: 4.23 oz (120 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 480 x 800 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Quad-core, 1300 MHz, ARM Cortex-A7, 32-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Talk time: 16.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 6.7 days (160 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 5. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: VoIP, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Digg Google Bookmarks StumbleUpon Reddit Newsvine Live Bookmarks Technorati Yahoo Bookmarks Blogmarks Del.icio.us ApnaCircle Google Plus Pinterest. Updated: May 18, 2017, 04.09 PM IST. If you can’t spend too much but still want a future-proof smartphone that can work with 4G networks (with VoLTE), Bharat 2 can be considered.. Related Xolo Era 2X review: A basic budget smartphone Alcatel Pixi 4 review: Budget smartphone for basic use but with poor battery life. Price: Rs 3,499 Specifications: 4-inch (800 x 480 pixels), quad core 1.3Ghz Spreadtrum processor, 512MB RAM, 4GB storage, microSD slot (up to 32GB supported), dual SIM, 2MP rear camera, VGA front camera, 4G , VoLTE, WiFi, Bluetooth, FM radio, Android 6.0, 1,300mAh battery 4G and VoLTE has now become a household requirement thanks to Jio. However, for users on a tight budget, there are not many options available in the sub Rs 4,000 price segment. Micromax’s Bharat 2 is the latest smartphone in this price range with 4G and VoLTE connectivity. The Bharat 2 feels sturdy for its size and features a removable back cover with a textured finish — this gives you a good grip on the phone. Under the cover is a removable battery, dual SIM slots (1 mini and 1 micro) and a dedicated microSD slot. It has the power and volume keys on the right side, 3.5mm jack on top and a microUSB port on the bottom. Overall, the phone feels good in the hand and even managed to survive a few accidental drops and bumps. It has a 4-inch display with a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels — fairly common in a sub Rs 4,000 smartphone. The brightness is good but sunlight legibility is poor. There is no light sensor on the phone, so you have to manually set the brightness level. Thankfully, the viewing angles are better than what we have seen on entry-level LYF devices. There are capacitive touch buttons under the screen for home, back and recent apps that work well, they are not backlit — we don’t expect backlit buttons in this price range, but it would have been a welcome addition. This is one of the cheapest smartphones you can get today with 4G and VoLTE support. We used the phone with a Jio Sim and the phone had no issues connecting and using the 4G network. It is powered by a 1.3Ghz quad core Spreadtrum processor and comes with 512MB RAM. Micromax has cleverly chosen a near stock user interface on the Bharat 2. Since it has basic hardware, the phone manages to run smoothly thanks to the lack of embellishments. In our usage, the phone worked smoothly as long as there were not too many apps running in the background. It even managed to play Subway Surfer (albeit with some stuttering) and even managed to run a 720p HD video using MX player. It has 4GB internal storage out of which only 2GB is available for the user — there is microSD slot for storage expansion and we suggest you get one along with the phone. Battery life is a mixed bag — with heavy usage of calls and 4G, the phone struggles to last from 9am to 3pm and you have to charge the phone again at night. However, if you work smartly and switch off 4G when not required, then the phone easily manages to last from 9am to 9pm. You get a 2MP rear camera with LED flash and a VGA front camera. As with budget smartphones, the cameras are nothing much to write about. The rear camera struggled to capture details even in daylight — the images are good to view on the phone, but if you try to zoom-in you will see the lack of details. In low light, it is best not to use the phone’s camera at all. The front facing camera also suffers from similar issues. One of the best things about the phone is its speakers — the loudspeaker as well as in-ear voice call speaker are loud and crisp. For its price, the Bharat 2 is meant for users who want to enjoy the latest 4G data connectivity but on a tight budget. For the same price, you should also consider the Swipe Konnect Star 4G that offers a larger 1,800mAh battery, 1GB RAM and 16GB internal storage.. Want stories like this in your inbox?
