ASUS ZenFone Go TV ZB551KL Reviews. ASUS ZenFone Go ZB551KL is a 5.5inch (1280 x 720) of display, 16GB and 32GB of storage, 13MP of main camera.. 2G, 3G, 4G (LTE), 16GB, 3... Please feel free to post your review on this product.. It's only been a week since I started using this. I replaced Nexus 5 with this.. It is now bigger, and I am not used to it. I think it is too big. 5.5inch screen is good, but I am having a trouble using it with one hand.. I hope I get used to it.. Volume button is on its back, and it is easy to use when I place it on a desk. If you are used to beautiful screens, this may not be good enough.. But it is not so good for listening to music. I thought it would do better as it is big.. It lasts well as it is new.. I think it is quite good. It is light for its size.. Wi-Fi connection is good, and I don't use GPS anyway. I am not expecting this to have a good camera either, so it is fine by me. At least for a middle-aged man like me.. You cannot use GPS or camera with this.. The GPS system has very bad performance. It cannot show the current position. Google map GPS cannot be used; it cannot detect GPS. Yahoo GPS is usable, but it gives me a direction after I pass an intersection, so I have to go a long way.. Voice call sound quality is bad. When I use my iPhone for a call, I can hear clearly with it.. It is a problem when it is not usable even when it is cheap. It has to be written clearly that GPS cannot be used.. iPhone might be the only choice.... I bought it in May 2016.. I started to feel it was not connected properly when I plugged the code in from about October. I tried several different codes, and I found one that works well. So I had no problem in using for a while.. But even with that code, it started to charge only up to 50% or so in in one night from this month. It seems it gets disconnected during the night.. It may not be helped because it is cheap. But I am happy that I was able to enjoy a big screen.. I think I will avoid Nexus.. Grabe ang Ganda Talaga ng Asus na to.. Ang phone ko na ito ay isang epic talaga kasi naman ang gara ng camera nito at hindi ito gaya ng iba na maganda lang sa una kaya subrang ganda nito kahit anong game na install ko okay din talaga very responsive phone and very good in battery. kaya kahit all day kungamitin ito okay talaga.. ASUS ZenFone Go ZB551KL pangarap ko na phone kaya ngayon ang sarap sa pakiramdam na nabili ko na rin sa wakas. Ang ganda pa ng design at display kasi mas presentable din naman tingnan to na phone kaya ang galing. Magaan lang din naman dalhin to na phone tamang-tama lang dalhin to na phone. Sa pag operate din ay hindi mahirap kaya nag ayos lang nitong smartphone na ito. Maganda pa din naman ang kuha sa camera kaya ang galing nitong tingnan kaya ganahan akong gumamit para mag selfie. At mas soft touch din naman ang screen nito at ang dali ko lang maka type ng message nito kaya ang galing. Ang tagal-tagal pa din naman malowbat nitong phone na ito kaya ang sulit ng pag gamit ko. Kaya ngayon iingatan ko talaga to na phone kasi ang ganda nga naman nito.. ASUS Mobile Phones > ASUS ZenFone > ZenFone 4 Selfie ZD553KL. Ang phone na ito ay may pretty good design at quality. Walang issues ng heating problems sa mga games tulad ng Gangster Vegas, Asphalt Extreme, Asphalt 8 Airbourne, at iba ppa. ASUS Mobile Phones > ASUS ZenFone > ZenFone Pegasus 4A. Super cool and very nice ang design ng phone na ito. maganda ang performance at may surprisingly good screen. 1.25GHz nga lang pero para sa akin ay plenty at mabilis na sa mga light tasks nang hindi ... ASUS Mobile Phones > ASUS ZenFone > ZenFone 4 Pro ZS551KL. Already available na ang phone na ito dito sa Philippines since nung December 2017 pa at nabili ko ito nito lang Janurary 2018. As for the performance nitong phone na ito, wala akong complains so far ... View Mode: PC | Mobile.

Asus Zenfone Go ZB551KL GPS Problem. First of all, I wanna know if there is someone out there with an Asus Zenfone Go ZB551KL and has no GPS Problem. Second, is there a fix to this crappy GPS? I've tried, wiping partition data, resetting (factory/hard reset) the phone, clearing cache, and the only option I have left is to send it to customer service (is that what it's called?) to fix it. Is there any other way or is Asus just incompetent in this area? I have to be blunt here because GPS is a big thing now since the release of Pokemon Go. If people get upset that their phone has crappy GPS, those people would tell their friends to not buy this product. I love Asus, I love ZenUI, but if the GPS doesn't work, then there is little reason to buy these phones.. Am also have same problem ,thank Asus give me a shxx experience next time i never support any product from this company any more and will tell anyone know about hell product.. Get it to the service center...could be a hardware issue...get it checked. Last edited by errrrrnest.alfonso on 2016/8/31 23:38. Why would they always say send it to the service center? In the first place, why are asus selling reject phones or why is it the common problem is their gps? Why can't they first fix the gps problem of their handsets before selling it so that consumers won't have to bring their phones to the service center a few weeks after they bought it? The reason we bought this phone is for quality and functionality.. they promised their clients that this phone can deliver what it says it can do. Gps is part of that function but most zenfones have gps problems. Also, why can't they just give us an OTA fix?. My experience with the service center was like hell.. and i don't want to return there. My phone was replaced by a new one because they further damaged my phone. I went there because i want my gps fixed. After a 2 weeks i returned there and after checking, my lcd was malfunctioning, at that same day, i retuned it to have it repaired again. After another 2 weeks, i returned and checked my phone, i noticed that my orietation sensors and camera are the ones that is malfunctioning. So i demanded a replacement unit. But after recieving my new unit. I came back to my first problem why i brought my phone to the service center. My gps again is the problem.. On my Zenfone 5, the GPS problem was solved, after I place the SIM card for data connection in slot 2.. I also have the exact same issue. This is a problem with the hardware used in the manufacture of these phones. Scary thing is, asus will not acknowledge it because its cheaper to avoid the issue than to deal with e.g., no body will die like the exploding Samsung battery issue, so no recall has been issued. I was about to buy a ZenPad as my next tablet, now I've changed brands. Now in ashamed of what you have become. Ребята если хотите, чтобы покупали ваш телефон, исправте. А так телефон нормальный, но GPS всё портит.</font></font>. <font><font>Кто нибудь из ASUS читает это? Изменения будут?</font></font>. It doesn't work completely!!! No professional feedback from Asus, to solve this problem. Item GPS must be removed from description of this model. 1 2 / 2 page Next. You need to login first Login | Register Now.

Schermo da 5,5" IPS LCD (1280x720p). Multitouch con interfaccia Asus ZenUI 2.0. Sistema operativo Android OS, v5.1 (Lollipop). Espansione memoria fino a 64 giga con micro-sd. Fotocamera principale da 8 MP o 13 MP, autofocus, LED flash. Batteria da 3010 mAh (Li-Ion) rimovibile. La Asus ad Aprile 2016 ha sfornato diversi smartphone e tra questi ritroviamo lo smartphone Asus Zenfone Go ZB551KL. Un nome strano per un modello. che non ha caratteristiche proprio eeccezionali ma che fa bene il suo lavoro. Avete letto già review con elenco di caratteristiche ? Sapete quanti giga di memoria Ram e Rom possiede, quale sistema operativo Android monta e che diagonale di schermo ha ? Quale chipset, processore e scheda grafica monta ? La batteria quanto è potente ed è rimovibile e le due fotocamere da quanti megapixel sono ? Inoltre è un dual sim oppure mono sim e monta micro o nano sim ? È predisposto per la rete veloce 4G LTE ? Ecco una recensione completa sullo smartphone Asus Zenfone Go ZB551KL con immagini, caratteristiche hardware e software, scheda e specifiche tecniche , giudizio del team e prezzo finale al pubblico italiano.. CARATTERISTICHE - ASUS ZENFONE GO ZB551KL. Questo smartphone è un dual sim che accetta l'inserimento di sim di tipo micro. Ha il supporto per le reti GSM, HSPA e 4G LTE e possiede uno schermo grande ben 5,5 pollici con un pannello che utilizza la tecnologia IPS LCD ed ha una risoluzione di 1280x720 pixel. La sua pixel density è di 267 ppi mentre l'interfaccia utilizzata per manovrare il sistema multitouch è la tipica Asus ZenUI 2.0. Per quanto riguarda ancora lo schermo esso possiede una protezione Corning Gorilla Glass 3. Il sistema operativo è Android Lollipop in versione 5.1 ma può essere facilmente aggiornato a Marshmallow senza particolari problemi. Il chipset è un bello e potente Qualcomm MSM8928 Snapdragon 400 con un processore di tipo quad-core da 1.6 GHz costruito con la tecnologia Cortex-A7. I 16 milioni di colori ed il loro sfruttamento sono affidati ad una scheda grafica Adreno 305. Per quanto concerne le memorie abbiamo la Ram che è di 2 giga mentre la memoria interna che è di 16 ma può anche essere di 64 giga (in base al modello quindi). in entrambi i casi comunque può essere ampliata utilizzando una micro sd da 64 gigabyte max di capienza. Il modulo per collegarsi al web e quindi alla rete internet è Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, quindi purtroppo non è dual band e possiede solo la funzine di hotspot con il WiFi-Direct che manca. Mancano anche la funzione DLNA e quella NFC per fare acquisti sicuri online ma ritroviamo un gps di tipo A-GPS Glonass ed un Bluetooth in versione 4.0, A2DP, EDR per poter scambiare dati con dispositivi compatibili con questa tecnologia. Purtroppo il browser presente è soltanto un browser di tipo HTML e non HTML5 e come sensori ritroviamo un accelerometro ed un sensore di prossimità. Le due fotocamere sono una da 8 megapixel oppure 13 megapixel ( dipende dalla versione acquistata o da quella disposnibile in Italia ), con apertura focale di f/2.0, sistema di autofocus, flash dual-LED ( dual tone ) e features come geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR, panorama. Registra video in full hd a 1080p@30fps. La fotocamera secondaria è di 5 megapixel e possiede anch'essa un'apertura focale di f/2.0. La batteria è potente 3010 mAh , è per fortuna rimovibile ed è costruita con la tecnologia Li-Ion. Può durare fino ad oltre 300 ore in modalità stand by con connessione 3G attiva e oltre 15 ore in modalità chiamata con connessione dati 3G sempre attiva. Non mancano un lettore multimediale che apre file audio video come MP3, WAV, eAAC+, MP4/H.264 , un lettore interno che ci permette di aprire diversi formati di documenti ed un piccolo editor per modificare foto e video.. SPECIFICHE - ASUS ZENFONE GO ZB551KL. FOTO 1 - ASUS ZENFONE GO ZB551KL. FOTO 2 - ASUS ZENFONE GO ZB551KL. SCHEDA DI VALUTAZIONE - ASUS ZENFONE GO ZB551KL. Giudizio del team : esteticamente riporta le stesse linee tipiche della serie Zenfone Go , quindi linee molto belle, con un design semplice ma accattivante e molto giovanile. Presenta anche una ergonomia ottima considerando il fatto che lo schermo è di ben 5,5 pollici. Stiamo parlando di un telefono di poco superiore ai 150 euro di prezzo e quindi di un dispositivo di fascia bassa ma sono soldi ben spesi perchè innanzitutto lo schermo si vede davvero bene, conosciamo la sua splendida interfaccia Zen UI e dobbiamo dire che il suo cuore pulsante è molto potente. Il chipset ed il processore non sono per niente male infatti. Le memorie ci soddisfano anch'esse con 2 giga di Ram. ma per quanto riguarda quella interna sarebbe meglio acquistare quella con la versione da 32 gigabyte. Purtroppo mancano alcune funzioni come il DLNA, il sistema NFC, il WiFi-Direct ed un browser HTML5. Belle le due fotocamere con la primaria abbastanza potente ma anche qui è possibile acquistare una versione di dispositivo con la fotocamera da 13 megapixel ed una con 8 megapixel. Manca ovviamente un lettore per le impronte digitali anche ma cosa volete di più con poco più di 150 euro ? È uno smartphone di fascia bassa molto competitivo davvero.. Prezzo consigliato al momento dell'uscita : 169,00 € (16 giga). Siti consigliati per l'acquisto : AMAZON - MEDIAWORLD - EBAY - PIXMANIA. Per eventuali altre info sull'oggetto : Sito ASUS ITALIA.

CNET también está disponible en español.. Asus ZenFone Go takes on Xiaomi's budget smartphones (hands-on). Powered by a quad-core MediaTek processor, the ZenFone Go isn't the most powerful of devices, but it's aiming for the low-end sweet spot.. by October 21, 2015 11:03 AM PDT. Asus shows off the ZenFone Go and ZenFone Laser (pictures). The Asus ZenFone Go is yet another ZenFone-branded device from the prolific Taiwanese electronics manufacturer and while its meagre specs may put off smartphone snobs, the phone's really targeted at the budget crowd.. The Go isn't the most mighty of devices -- it's powered by a lower-end quad-core MediaTek processor, the 1.3GHz MT6580 -- but Asus is selling this phone really cheaply in Asia. In Singapore, it retails for just S$179, which converts to approximately $130.. Asus has thrown down the gauntlet to Xiaomi, putting the Go squarely in the same price range as the Chinese smartphone maker's budget Redmi 2. Its specs aren't too shabby, considering the price. It has more RAM at 2GB than the Redmi 2, and depending on the model, will come with either 8GB or 16GB of onboard storage. Like the Redmi 2, the Go will sport an 8-megapixel rear camera.. Asus shows off the ZenFone Go and ZenFone Laser (pictures). That said, it seems to lack 4G LTE capabilities -- a big selling point for the Redmi 2 -- which doesn't bode well. This will however allow Asus to sell this phone in more places without having to worry about network compatibility, and it does have dual SIM slots.. Rounding up the rest of the hardware is a removable 2,070mAh battery, a 5-inch HD display with a 1,280x720-pixel resolution and a microSD card slot, should you need more storage space.. Looks-wise, the Go takes after its more expensive ZenFone brethren and has the same concentric-circle pattern below the display. The one thing I feel that the phone does better is the placement of the power button and volume controls -- these are sensibly located at the right side. This is so much better than the ZenFone Selfie and ZenFone 2 Laser 's power button, which is right at the top of the phone and requires an awkward stretch of your fingers.. The ZenFone Go is currently available in Southeast Asia, and there's no word yet on whether the phone will make an appearance in western markets such as the UK or the US. The same goes for Australia as well, despite the country's regional proximity to Asia.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

If the link doesnt work try looking here https://www.asus.com/support/Downloa...yUA5DhW70G/32/ The name of the firmware is something like this UL-ASUS_ZB551KL-WW-13.2.8.13-user.zip. 2)Put the old firmware or UL-ASUS_ZB551KL-WW-13.2.8.13-user.zip to the microsd. Press together Power Button + Down Volume. Hold it until the Asus Logo Shows up. (My own method, that works for me is after the Logo shows up, i spam press,not holdPower Button + Down Volume). 3)Wipe Data Reset and Cache (Just make sure you wipe the internal storage not the microsd). Use Volume up or volume down to go to your file target. Then hit power button to choose your file. 4) After Wiping,Apply Update From SD Card just wait... Then you downgraded the firmware! Go set it up. Because this is the one that works. Here is the latest link https://forum.xda-developers.com/dev...t/dl/?id=23923. 6) Then your good to go! Credits again to Angelito Cristobal..
