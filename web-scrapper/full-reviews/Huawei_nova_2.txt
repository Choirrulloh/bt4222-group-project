Huawei Nova 2 + Nova 2 Plus hands-on. You can't buy it in Europe (yet), but Huawei's mid-priced Nova 2 phones look better than ever.. A year on from the launch of the Huawei Nova series , the company has yet to announce any plans to bring the Nova 2 to Europe. Nevertheless, the phones were on display at its booth at IFA 2017 in Berlin, giving us our first look at the company's mid-tier flagships for 2017.. Unlike last year's Nova phones, which used radically different designs, the look and feel of the Nova 2 is uniform across both sizes. The regular Nova 2 packs a 5-inch display, while the Nova 2 Plus bumps up to 5.5 inches, and both look a little bit like a collision between a Huawei P10 and an iPhone 7. On the front, there's little going on besides a fairly standard bezel ratio and some Huawei branding.. Around the back, twin 12-megapixel RGB cameras are sandwiched between iPhone-like antenna bands, with a central rear-facing fingerprint scanner. In a market dominated by interchangeable aluminum frames, it's not the most eye-catching design out there — particularly compared to the Nexus 6P homage of the original, smaller Nova — but it works. It's also a good deal softer in the hand than last year's Novas, with no overt chamfers to be seen except for around the power and volume keys.. A more uniform design for Huawei's second-gen Nova phones.. While it is a pretty generic design overall, the wide variety of color options is welcome, including a snazzy green model similar to the heavily-promoted "greenery" P10.. The move towards dual cameras also brings Huawei's mid-tier brand in line with the rest of its product range — although unlike the P and Mate series, there's no Leica branding (or, presumably, Leica processing) going on here.. Both displays are 1080p LCD panels — on paper, the same as the original Nova phones, but more vibrant colors can be noticed in this year's models, particularly on the larger Nova 2. As we've seen from many previous Huawei phones, colors tend towards being a little cooler than we'd like, though that's easily fixed by tweaking the white balance in the display menu.. Spec-wise, Huawei's homegrown Kirin 659 provides ample performance, thanks to eight Cortex-A53 cores and a Mali-T830 MP2 GPU, paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. We've already seen Android 7.0 Nougat and EMUI 5.1 running well on mid-tier chips, and responsiveness in everyday apps isn't noticeably different from Huawei's high-end phones, as we'd expect. And while we can't judge battery life from just a brief time using a phone on the show floor, the Nova 2 and Nova 2 Pro's battery capacities of 2950mAh and 3340mAh respectively suggests getting that a full day per charge won't be a problem.. Aside from a few changes to the default skin, EMUI is a very familiar experience on the Nova 2, bringing the cleanest, most pared-back Huawei software we've seen to date, alongside some genuinely useful features, and the company's claim of software-based AI capabilities to maintain performance over time.. So far, that's nothing we haven't already seen in countless Huawei phones over the past year.. Dual RGB cameras, 12-megapixel resolution and f/1.8 lenses make for a promising mid-range camera array.. The new camera setup is the main differentiator here. Huawei hasn't simply repurposed an earlier dual-camera setup — the Nova 2 features a new camera array, made up of 12-megapixel main sensor with 1.25-micron pixels, behind a f/1.8 lens, along with an 8-megapixel secondary sensor. Both are RGB sensors this time, in contrast to Huawei's other models, which use a secondary monochrome sensor for capturing fine detail. The results, as far as we've been able to gauge under bright show lighting, are promising — though it's unclear how low light performance will measure up given the lack of optical stabilization in either camera.. In any case, the Nova 2 and Nova 2 Plus have made a positive first impression, and we'll look forward to spending more time with them if a European release materializes.. The Huawei Nova 2 and Nova 2 Plus are currently available in China, priced Nova 2 will cost 2,500 yuan ($360) and 2,900 yuan ($425) respectively. Huawei hasn't yet announced any plans to bring either model to the West.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

Huawei Nova 2: Everything you need to know. Huawei's latest camera phones appear in China, rest of world to wait. Update: Now the Huawei Nova 2 and Nova 2 Plus have been announced, we’ve updated our rumor story with all the official news.. Huawei has announced the follow-up to the Nova series, called the Nova 2. The company hasn’t wasted any time in coming out with a sequel, having only released the Nova and Nova Plus at the end of 2016. This time, it has restricted the release to China, at least for now, rather than the wider global launch the original Nova enjoyed last year.. There are two phones in the family, the Nova 2 and Nova 2 Plus, which are separated primarily by the screen and battery size. While we can’t buy either in the U.S. or Europe yet, there’s still the chance Huawei may bring them out at a later date, so let’s examine them in detail.. The metal body reminds us of the Honor 8 and Honor 8 Pro , along with the Apple iPhone, due to its curved antenna bands carefully disguised at the top and bottom of the phone. A fingerprint sensor is mounted on the rear of the phone, below a dual-lens camera. The screen measures 5-inches and has a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution, and is covered in a piece of 2.5D Gorilla Glass.. The two cameras operate like other setups we’ve seen, including the Huawei P10 , with a 2x optical zoom, and the chance to add a blurred background effect to your pictures. One lens has 12 megapixels and the other 8 megapixels, while the selfie camera has 20 megapixels. A Huawei designed Kirin 659 processor with 4GB of RAM provides the power, and it drives Android 7.0 with Huawei’s own EMUI 5.1 user interface over the top.. Other specifications include a 2,950mAh battery with fast charging, 64GB of internal storage, space for a MicroSD card, and a 3.5mm headphone socket. The phone weighs 143 grams, and is a mere 6.9mm thick.. Sharing the same design, processor, and operating system as the Nova 2, the larger Nova 2 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen with the same 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution. The battery has a 3340mAh capacity, and there’s 128GB of internal storage space, further separating it from the smaller sister phone.. The Nova 2 series comes in five different colors: green, gold, rose gold, blue, and black. If you’re in China, orders are live on June 16, and the Nova 2 will cost 2,500 yuan, or about $360, or 2,900 yuan/$425 for the Nova 2 Plus..

Huawei Nova 2 review: a sleek smartphone with a vision. Huawei Nova review: great design and price. Huawei introduced the Nova series at the IFA in 2016, and now its successor is heading to stores shortly before the 2017 trade show - but it bears little resemblance to the first Nova. The Huawei Nova 2's new features: dual camera, a completely modern design, and the. highlight—a 20-megapixel selfie cam—secure its place at the top of the mid-range smartphone market. ✕ The rear can quickly get dirty. ✕ Hard to feel the fingerprint sensor. ✕ Performance is not at a high-end level. Huawei Nova 2 release date and price. The Huawei Nova 2 launched at. $365 and is now available at numerous retailers in various colors including Graphite Black, Prestige Gold and Aurora Blue.. Huawei Nova 2 design and build quality. The Huawei Nova 2’s back / © AndroidPIT. “That really looks like an iPhone!” - I’m sick and tired of hearing this phrase, especially since it’s not even true most of the time. But when it comes to the Huawei Nova 2, you can’t help but say: Yes, it really does look a bit more like an iPhone than many other smartphones. It’s not that it’s an awful thing in general, because the iPhone is very sleek and very well crafted too. Measuring 5 inches across the screen, the Huawei Nova 2 is among the most compact smartphones, and it is also only 6.9 millimeters thick and weighs 143 grams. The antenna strips are well hidden on the top and bottom of the back half. The texture on the power button could be a bit more prominent, since you can hardly feel it. On the other hand, Huawei didn’t give much love to the dual camera; both lenses significantly protrude and are quite sharp-edged. Even the edge of the fingerprint sensor could have been made finer.. The Huawei Nova 2's back is matt-colored and has a sleek look. On the one hand, the surface is highly susceptible to fingerprints, like on the Huawei P10; on the other hand, it’s not too resilient either. Our Nova 2 review device has already suffered a significant flaw after two weeks; the silver aluminum was peeling. Thus, a case is recommended, which has the additional advantage of making. the Nova 2 more pleasantly flat and compact. The wide edges above and below the screen look a bit old-fashioned and do not quite match the rest of the phone.. The Nova 2’s display is quite compact at 5 inches.. has a 5-inch LTPS display with full HD resolution. At this size, it is fully sufficient and provides a ppi value of 443 on paper and very vivid images in day-to-day use. Its color reproduction is pleasing and natural-looking. Viewing angle stability is good, but it’s not as good as higher-end luxury smartphones, and the display becomes a bit darker when viewed from the side. What a shame: Instead of using the ample space below the display for the Android buttons, Huawei uses on-screen control, which takes up additional space on this small display.. By default, the phone is charged with Quick Charge and USB-C. Among the Huawei Nova 2’s features are the fingerprint sensor, nowadays standard equipment in this price range. But the folks at Huawei apparently don’t have much of a clue about what to do with this component. The scanner used to be located on the rear, the P10 saw it move a bit forwards, and it also remained there in all smartphones with screens smaller than 5.5 inches. However, this idea was scrapped a short while later with the P10 Lite, but now the Nova 2 wants to bring it back. It’s funny how Huawei simply doesn’t find and follow a consistent approach with this. The sensor itself works great on the Nova 2, but this is something that you now expect from Huawei. However, the sensor here is not slightly embedded in the housing, but rather flatly mounted. Combined with the hardly tangible ring around it, you can’t feel it very well with your finger. Huawei can do better than this.. Huawei delivers the Nova 2 with Android 7.0 Nougat with its proprietary EMUI 5.1 on top. Its appearance can not only be adjusted with pre-made themes but also at a very detailed level. In its default setting, the EMUI on the Nova 2 looks somewhat cheerful and not really modern, but this depends on your personal taste. a total of three third-party apps: Facebook, Instagram, and Booking.com, all of which can be uninstalled. Among EMUI’s features are the system search available from everywhere with a downward swipe and the lack of an app drawer, which can now also be shown if you want to.. The Huawei Nova 2 sports a Kirin 659 by Hisilicon. The octa-core processor has four quick and four slow Cortex A53 cores with a maximum clock speed of 2.36 GHz. At 4 GB RAM and 64 GB of internal storage, its memory is more than enough in this price range. Apps booted quickly in the review, and the Huawei Nova 2 even handles elaborate websites and graphically sophisticated games. Some truly demanding 3D games bring the smartphone to its knees, but it’s simply not intended for that. A user will hardly have any problems with the Nova 2’s performance in normal everyday use.. The bottom of the Nova 2 is equipped with an average quality mono speaker. This also applies to the headset with the plastic headphones, which is better than no headphones, but not by much.. The Nova 2 has a dual camera on the back / © AndroidPIT. HDR test photo with the Huawei Nova 2 / © AndroidPIT. The Nova 2 has a dual camera on the rear, while the Nova 2’s front camera has two lenses with a 12 and 8-megapixel sensor with an f/1.9 aperture. Both are color sensors, and there is no monochrome sensor like the Leica cameras in the P and Mate series. Nevertheless, the Nova 2 takes very respectable photos that can furthermore be embellished with a. Portrait shots have their own distinct. mode, and photos have lively colors and fine detail. There is no 4K support for videos, but there is slow motion and time lapse.. The front camera has a 20-megapixel sensor and should provide decent-looking. This was the case during the review, and the software even conjures up a mild Bokeh effect in the image, although it’s not as pretty as with the rear dual camera. The beautification option with a scale of 0 to 10 is just a gimmick. Nevertheless the Huawei Nova 2’s selfie cam is fun and delivers better images than many other smartphone cameras in this price range. You can find additional full-resolution images here .. The Huawei Nova 2 has a sealed battery with a capacity of 2,950 mAh, and it was easily enough to get the smartphone through the day during the review, even with heavy use. If you watch videos at full brightness for a long time, you will have to look for a power outlet after a good six hours, which is a respectable figure. Huawei’s included quick-charge charger provides 2 amps and tops up the battery in roughly one-and-a-half hours, but no wireless charging is available.. 142.2 x 68.9 x 6.9 mm. 1920 x 1080 pixels (441 ppi). The Huawei Nova 2 is a well-made mid-range smartphone that can stand out from the crowd. Although its performance is not at the level of a high-end smartphone, that’s not something you can necessarily expect for under $400, either. This price nets the buyer a decent complete package that’s pleasantly compact with a well-made casing.. May i know Huawei Price ? wow it's amazing :).

Follow-up to last year's Nova gets dual cameras and 20Mp selfie camera. SHOULD I BUY HUAWEI NOVA 2?. A hands-on review of Huawei's latest mid-range Android phones, the Nova 2 and Nova 2 Plus. Follow-up to last year's Nova gets dual cameras and 20Mp selfie camera. Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices. Huawei has announced the follow-up to last year's Nova (and Nova Plus ). The Nova 2, and 2 Plus have a new design and some pretty nifty camera features for those wanting a mid-priced phone with flagship camera specs.. We got some hands-on time with the phones in China, which is where they'll launch first. Currently they're on pre-order (officially on sale 16 June, but already on sale in Huawei's Shenzhen store). There's no official word they'll come to the UK, Europe or the US, but there's a chance that they will.. As before, the Nova 2 - the smaller model - has a 5in full-HD screen and the larger one - the Nova 2 Plus - has a 5.5in screen.. The 5in model costs 2499 Yuan (approx US$365 / £349) and the 5.5in 2899 Yuan (approx US$420 / £379).. Last year's pair didn't share the same design, and we prefered the smaller model, which looked a lot like a baby Google Nexus 6P.. In 2017, things have changed and they are now essentially identical. And not only to each other but there's also an uncanny resemblance to the iPhone 7 Plus, especially if you go for the matte black version. Here's the Nova 2 Plus in black:. Other colours include white/silver, light green and blue, the latter of which would be our pick.. Both phones have dual rear cameras and apart from the separate lenses (which only slightly protrude from the back of the case) the layout is just like the iPhone's.. An obvious difference is the fingerprint scanner mounted centrally on the rear, which means there's only a Huawei logo beneath the screen on the front - these devices rely on on-screen buttons for navigation.. Button layout is similar to most Android phones, with the volume rocker above a textured sleep/wake button.. On the bottom edge is a 3.5mm headphone socket, a USB-C port and a familiar-looking speaker grille. The SIM tray resides at the top of the left side and houses a micro SIM and microSD card.. The chassis is metal and the rear has a matt finish which is polished on the sides. It feels good in the hand and as well built as all of Huawei's phones, including the P10.. Resolution looks higher than it is, and both phones are bright and have vivid colours.. Clearly photography is one of the Nova's priorities. At the rear, the dual cameras have 12- and 8Mp resolutions. The former is the main shooter (with an f/1.8 lens) with the latter being used with a 2x telephoto lens, the sensor is not monochrome as with the P9 and P10 - it's full colour.. This setup is just like the iPhone 7 Plus', albeit with the tele camera at a lower resolution. The cameras can also work together to create a shallow depth effect like the iPhone, and from a few test shots, this seems to work just as well.. Usually you'd expect a lower resolution front camera, but the Nova 2 gets a whopping 20Mp, f/2.0 selfie camera, giving those that love to take photos of themselves - and friends - a real incentive to pick the Nova 2 over its rivals. Even the P10 has only an 8Mp front camera, so the Nova 2 trumps it here.. Video is where you notice the effects of the mid-range price: the Kirin processor can handle a maximum of 1080p at 30fps, so there's no 60fps support, or 4K.. We took a mixture of indoor and outdoor test shots, and from viewing the photos on the phone's screen, they looked to be decent, both from the front and rear cameras. Zooming right in to see close-up detail showed some evidence of noise reduction, but nothing you can spot when zoomed out.. Since Huawei designs and makes its own chips, it's no surprise to see that HiSilicon Kirin 659 processor. This effectively replaces the Snapdragon 625 which powered the original Nova.. The 659 has eight cores, four of which run at 2.36GHz - the high performance quad-core - and four at 1.7GHz for when better power efficiency is needed.. This is paired with 4GB of RAM and either 64GB of internal storage. The Plus model is additionally available with 128GB of storage and has a 3340mAh battery - the smaller Nova 2 a 2950mAh cell.. These are decent capacities for handsets which measure just 6.9mm thick.. They both support quick charging, too.. Unfortunately, we weren't able to test out performance in our limited time with the phones, partly because were running the Chinese version of EMUI which has no Google apps including the Play Store. These are, of course, present in the UK, US and European versions of Huawei's Android devices.. Subjectively, though, the Nova 2 feels responsive and snappy.. The pair run Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box, with Huawei's EMUI 5.1 software on top. This changes the look from stock Android a fair bit, but at least with version 5.1 you have several launcher options.. Previously, home screen icons were laid out like iOS, with no app tray but now you have the option to choose either.. You also get plenty of extra features, including shortcuts to launch the camera from sleep mode by double-pressing the volume down button, a memory optimiser utility and - similar to iOS - app suggestions when you swipe right from the main home screen.. The camera app has a few more features than the stock Android version too, such as object tracking.. A highlight, though, is the self-optimising system which prevents Android from slowing down over time, no matter how many apps you install or whether the storage is full.. 12Mp and 8Mp main cameras with LED flash, support for video at 1080p @ 30fps. 142.2 x 68.9 x 6.9 mm. 12Mp and 8Mp main cameras with LED flash, support for video at 1080p @ 30fps. 142.2 x 68.9 x 6.9 mm. Given the limited hands-on time, it's too early to give any buying advice. However, the mid-range price does make both the Nova 2 and Nova 2 Plus seem good value if you're particularly after a phone for taking all kinds of photos. They're not so hot for video, however.. There's no word on whether either or both will come to the UK, but you'll be able to import them relatively easily via Chinese retailers such as GearBest and Geekbuying..

Huawei Nova 2: Everything you need to know. Huawei Nova 2 Huawei Nova 2 Plus Huawei Watch 2 Sport vs. Huawei Watch 2 Classic: Which one is right for you?. Update: Now the Huawei Nova 2 and Nova 2 Plus have been announced, we’ve updated our rumor story with all the official news.. Huawei has announced the follow-up to the Nova series, called the Nova 2. The company hasn’t wasted any time in coming out with a sequel, having only released the Nova and Nova Plus at the end of 2016. This time, it has restricted the release to China, at least for now, rather than the wider global launch the original Nova enjoyed last year.. There are two phones in the family, the Nova 2 and Nova 2 Plus, which are separated primarily by the screen and battery size. While we can’t buy either in the U.S. or Europe yet, there’s still the chance Huawei may bring them out at a later date, so let’s examine them in detail.. The metal body reminds us of the Honor 8 and Honor 8 Pro , along with the Apple iPhone, due to its curved antenna bands carefully disguised at the top and bottom of the phone. A fingerprint sensor is mounted on the rear of the phone, below a dual-lens camera. The screen measures 5-inches and has a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution, and is covered in a piece of 2.5D Gorilla Glass.. The two cameras operate like other setups we’ve seen, including the Huawei P10 , with a 2x optical zoom, and the chance to add a blurred background effect to your pictures. One lens has 12 megapixels and the other 8 megapixels, while the selfie camera has 20 megapixels. A Huawei designed Kirin 659 processor with 4GB of RAM provides the power, and it drives Android 7.0 with Huawei’s own EMUI 5.1 user interface over the top.. Other specifications include a 2,950mAh battery with fast charging, 64GB of internal storage, space for a MicroSD card, and a 3.5mm headphone socket. The phone weighs 143 grams, and is a mere 6.9mm thick.. Sharing the same design, processor, and operating system as the Nova 2, the larger Nova 2 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen with the same 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution. The battery has a 3340mAh capacity, and there’s 128GB of internal storage space, further separating it from the smaller sister phone.. The Nova 2 series comes in five different colors: green, gold, rose gold, blue, and black. If you’re in China, orders are live on June 16, and the Nova 2 will cost 2,500 yuan, or about $360, or 2,900 yuan/$425 for the Nova 2 Plus..

If you want to describe Huawei Nova 2i in one sentence it would be "simple and elegant modern smartphone". Nova 2i is not packed with tons of features but it is a performance master with excellent design and camera. 4 GB RAM, 64 GB ROM, fine battery backup with up to 20 hours talk-time, octa-core CPU, 4G network and Mali-T830 MP2 GPU ensures pure classy performance whether it be browsing, gaming, chatting, watching videos, using apps or social media. In terms of design, Huawei Nva 2i is offering 5.9 inch bezel-less display! This makes the device highly attractive for people who wants to watch movies or YouTube videos in the phone. Large display is pretty nice for gaming, browsing and overall other activities. Being bezel-less makes the display even larger. But the main core feature of Huawei Nova 2i is "4 cameras". It has 2 cameras in the front and two in the back. When you take photo for example with front camera, both 13 and 2 megapixel camera will become combined and deliver one single excellent photo. Same with the 16 + 2 MP back camera. It is even higher quality with that extra megapixel, face/smile detection and laser autofocus. You can even readjust autofocus after taking the photo. They have also used the so-called "Beauty 4.0 algorithm to increase the face beauty performance which looks more naturalistic. The cameras also have improved flash, brightness and lighting..

One of them is the Huawei Nova 2. While it is already priced at the upper limit of this category at 399 Euros (~$468), it certainly delivers in terms of features.. The Nova 2 features a stylish aluminum case, which obviously looks similar to the Apple iPhone, while it does not imitate every detail. For example, the 5-inch Huawei has the fingerprint sensor on the rear. Hence it can be easily reached with the index finger. The 2.5D display on the front features a Full HD resolution and 443 PPI. The Nova 2 is powered by a fast. octa core SoC and 4 GB of RAM. Thanks to a storage capacity of 64 GB you will not run out of storage space quickly.

Moreover, the rounded corners and edges as well as the matte rear cover, which ensures secure grip with a slightly roughened surface, feel good to the touch. The fingerprint sensor on the rear is slightly recessed. Hence, it is easily discernible by touch. Huawei has incorporated the 2.5D glass into the case without any visible inaccuracy. We even failed to twist the smartphone by applying high force. Only the display showed minimal waves, which disappeared as quickly as they appeared..

At the time of testing, Android security patches as of 06-05-2017 were installed, which are already no longer up-to-date.. Although the firmware takes up quite a lot of space on the smartphone with almost 16 GB, which might primarily be due to the EMUI interface, there are hardly any software extras included. Apart from the mandatory Google apps, Huawei has pre-installed only a few tools, for example a data backup app, a SIM toolkit, and the HiCare service app. Among others, the latter provides access to the service center of the manufacturer and Huawei's forum.

The Huawei Nova 2 communicates via GSM quad band (850, 900, 1.800, 1.900 MHz), UMTS quad band (800, 850, 900, 2.100 MHz), and LTE Cat.6 (800, 850, 900, 1800, 2100, 2600 MHz) in the mobile telephone network. Downloads are possible with 300 MBit/s, the maximum upload rate is 50 MBit/s. During our time with the phone, reception worked flawlessly in the Vodafone network in the countryside.. However, the Wi-Fi performance of the Nova 2 is poor: With 802.11 b/g/n, not only does the smartphone lack the fast 802.11-ac standard, but also support of the 5 GHz band. As a result, the Huawei can only use the slow 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi. In view of its potential, it performs very well here. The Nova 2 reaches up to 75 MBit/s when exchanging data with our Linksys EA8500 reference router. The ac competition is at least twice as fast and is led by the LG G6, which achieves a maximum of 325 MBit/s..

The GPS module of the Nova 2 works fast and geolocates with an accuracy of up to 4 meters (~13 ft) outdoors. The accuracy is almost just as high indoors (5 meters/~16 ft). Moreover, the smartphone achieved the same accuracy on our 12 km (~7.5 mi) long bike test route. The Nova 2 performs only marginally worse than the professional navigation device Garmin Edge 500. While the smartphone deviates a few meters here and there from the ideal in the route, the deviations from the reference device are only very small overall. The total deviation on the whole route is only 10 meters (~33 ft). Thus, the Huawei Nova 2 performs more than adequately in geolocation for everyday tasks.. Apart from good frequency coverage, the Nova 2 also convinces in voice quality. During test calls to fixed and mobile phone networks, the voices of our partners sounded natural via speaker and the included headset without distortions. Moreover, the volume can be turned up very high without distortions. When hands-free communication is enabled, both sides have to listen slightly more carefully. Voices sounded slightly tinny here, but effortless communication was still possible.. HDR shot taken with the main camera. The selfie camera shoots portraits with a resolution of 20 MP (up to 5120x3840 pixels). While shots have a good quality, they are not as outstanding as you might expect in view of the high mega pixel count. You do not even have to look very closely in order to notice significant blurring and image artifacts in 1:1 images. Selfie fans will not mind this, since beauty and bokeh mode are available for fiddling about. Moreover, you can record Full HD videos with 30 FPS in decent quality. However, a 20 MP resolution is really unnecessary - a lower number of mega pixels would have also been okay.. A 12 MP camera with dual lens, LED flash and f/1.8 aperture sits on the rear of the Nova 2. Its maximum resolution is 3968x2976 pixels (4:3 format). In 16:9 format, the resolution falls to 9 MP or 3968x2440 pixels.. Huawei has packed many features into the camera app. The rear camera has more features available, primarily recording modes such as HDR and night. Depth of field and beauty mode of the selfie camera can also be selected here. Furthermore, a manual mode is also available: If you select "professional photo", you can adjust parameters such as exposure time and sensitivity. If you are not sure what each mode is good for, you can click on an info icon on the top right of the display and will get a short explanation in transparent letters. It is also handy that the menu covers recording aids such as smile recognition, a timer, and an audio release, which is triggered by either the word "cheese" or a minimum volume.. The 12-MP camera shoots good images, which appear very vibrant, thanks to the high contrast. Due to high sharpening, images appear slightly unnatural however. Moreover, the camera software does a bit too much on homogeneous image parts. Poor ambient light is not a problem for the light sensitive lens. However, the peculiarities of the camera get more obvious in this scenario. Moreover, low-light images show quite a visible noise.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. Finally, we want to check how the camera of the Nova 2 performs under controlled light conditions. As the ColorChecker figure shows, most, but not all colors are over-saturated. The phone creates sharp images without problems. However, it suffers from aggressive sharpening, which shows in the form of hard transitions between image structures and the fonts.. The target color is in the lower half of each patch.. Huawei includes a modular power adapter, a USB Type-C cable, a headset, a protective sleeve, a SIM tool and a quick start guide. The manufacturer does not offer accessories for its smartphone on its web page.. The warranty is for only 6 months on the battery and the power adapter, and 3 months for the headset.. The touchscreen of the Huawei Nova 2 feels very good to the touch and accurately responds to commands up to the corners. Furthermore, it features handy extras such as one-handed operation and pocket mode. The latter prevents the smartphone getting activated accidentally when carrying it in pockets or bags. You can enable a glove mode, which allows using the Nova 2 in winter or cold weather without frozen fingers. The fingerprint reader on the back can be used in a versatile way: As a security feature, it can unlock the display, allow access to locked apps, and serve as a safe for secure payments. In addition, pressing the fingerprint reader can accept calls, stop the alarm, display the notification field or even record images or videos.. The Nova 2 uses the well-known SwiftKey keyboard by default. You can find many alternatives in Google's App Store, for example Google's GBoard.. The 5-inch IPS display features Full HD resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, which gives an impressive pixel density of 443 PPI. The display is quite bright with an average of 487.4 cd/mÂ² when displaying a purely white background. The brightness sensor, which is enabled by default, automatically adjusts the brightness to the ambient light, which protects the user's eyes. The same is true when the blue filter is enabled. With an even distribution of bright and dark images parts (APL 50), the brightness falls only marginally (470 cd/mÂ²).. The display's extremely even brightness distribution of 97% is noticeable. Thanks to it, even large homogeneous color parts do not look uneven. The black value of 0.48 is decent for an IPS display. The same is true for the contrast ratio of 1002:1. The LG G6 proves that an IPS display can perform significantly better with a huge contrast ratio of 2809:1 and brightness higher than 600 cd/mÂ². Moreover, the Nova 2 cannot keep up with the very good display results of the. 484 cd/m² 481 cd/m² 491 cd/m² 489 cd/m² 481 cd/m² 495 cd/m² 486 cd/m² 484 cd/m² 496 cd/m². 97 % Center on Battery: 481. cd/m²) ΔE Color 5.2 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 6.8 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.31.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display.

This means that the measured response time is worse than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. The display settings allow adjusting the color temperature either with one of the three profiles, "Standard", "Warm", and "Cold", or by clicking a point on the color circle. The Nova 2 does not deliver balanced colors with default settings. The color temperature is far too cool with 8149 K and the display looks noticeably bluish. Colors and grayscales are also not ideal with Delta-E deviations significantly above 3. It is recommended to select the color profile "Warm" for a more natural look of the contents. In our test, the color temperature (6592 K) got almost perfect with this profile. The Delta-E values also improved slightly (grayscales: 5.6 vs. Not everything is perfect with color profile "Warm" either. The display is slightly greenish now..

However, you should avoid direct sunlight, if you do not want to turn the smartphone into a makeup mirror. The content can be easily recognized in the shade. The Nova 2 benefits from its wide viewing angles here. Screen contents can be recognized even from flat angles and the luminance drops only slightly..

With maximum temperatures of 39.3 Â°C (~103 Â°F), the Huawei Nova 2 gets more than lukewarm on a few spots (around the Android keys). However, the temperature does not increase that much when you use the smartphone to capacity. Under full load, we measured a maximum of 39.3 Â°C (~103 Â°F) after an hour of stress test. The average temperature is just slightly above 35 Â°C (~95 Â°F) on the front and the back.. Finally, we checked whether the SoC throttles under maximum load with the T-Rex benchmark from GFXBench. The frame rates did not fall and also no other anomalies which might hint at overloading of the SoC occurred, even after 30 runs of the test scene.. 37.2 °C 33.8 °C 36.4 °C. 37.6 °C 34.1 °C 39.6 °C. 36 °C 35.6 °C 37.9 °C.

Although only one mono speaker is incorporated in the smartphone, the Huawei generates surprisingly good sound, which even sounds slightly space-filling. The small speaker can even get decently loud without distortions. Like many other smartphones, the Nova 2 produces very linear highs and balanced mid-tones. If you connect a headset, the Huawei automatically activates the Histen sound effects and can generate 3D sound with 32-Bit-DAC AK4376a. The result actually sounds quite good and you can enjoy listening to music, watching videos, and gaming.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 31.6 31.2 25 25.4 38.4 31 25.3 30.1 40 32.9 30.2 50 33.6 31.9 63 31.6 35.5 80 28.4 24.5 100 27 26.9 125 20.8 23.7 160 22 39 200 21.3 50.5 250 20.8 49.5 315 21.2 49.3 400 19.4 58.2 500 19.5 59.9 630 17.7 63.6 800 17.9 62.5 1000 17.8 67 1250 17.3 72.4 1600 17.4 73.6 2000 16.7 72.2 2500 17.2 73.3 3150 18.2 74.6 4000 17.9 73.8 5000 17.6 76.4 6300 17.7 76.9 8000 17.8 76.4 10000 17.9 77.6 12500 18.1 75.5 16000 18.2 62.9 SPL 30 85.7 N 1.3 61.9 median 17.9 Huawei Nova 2 median 67 Delta 1.3 11.8 37.5 36.4 27.1 34.8 32.4 37.5 34.8 27.7 26.6 30.8 31.3 34.8 32.2 33.6 29.5 29.7 31.7 32.2 38.3 36 34.9 33.7 26 38.3 50.5 47.1 47.3 47.7 39.4 50.5 31.6 33.3 29.1 31.9 36.2 31.6 28.2 31.5 32.6 26.7 28.6 28.2 30.6 25.2 27.6 24.5 25.4 30.6 32.6 26.4 28.5 23.6 21.3 32.6 42.5 23.5 39.9 22.1 23.3 42.5 49.4 23.4 46.6 21.2 22.5 49.4 55 24.6 50 22.7 22.4 55 59.5 31.5 53.3 26.1 21.3 59.5 63.5 28.7 55.4 21.8 18.4 63.5 67.1 26.3 58.6 20.1 17.5 67.1 69.2 30.2 56.8 20.3 17.5 69.2 70.3 37.6 57 22.2 17.2 70.3 70.1 41.7 56.9 28.5 16.8 70.1 74.8 52.6 60.8 40.6 17.3 74.8 78.4 59.8 62.9 45.8 17.4 78.4 78.7 61.3 64.9 42.3 16.6 78.7 82 65.1 66.2 47.5 17.3 82 79.5 63.9 63.3 48.8 17.6 79.5 77.6 68.2 62 48.9 17.6 77.6 72 73.3 56.6 54.2 17.7 72 61.6 73.2 46 53.9 17.4 61.6 53.3 71.1 36.7 52.9 17.7 53.3 47.4 73.9 26.9 54.8 17.9 47.4 39.9 73.1 22.6 54.2 18.1 39.9 26.8 59.6 18.7 41.1 18.1 26.8 88.4 80.3 73.3 61.6 29.8 88.4 64.5 34.8 27.8 11.8 1.3 64.5 median 63.5 Huawei P9 Plus median 52.6 median 55.4 median 40.6 median 17.7 median 63.5 12.6 20.2 11.8 13.3 1.6 12.6 31.6 42.9 25.4 33.8 25.3 27.8 32.9 33.2 33.6 41.7 31.6 31.9 28.4 31.8 27 26 20.8 24.7 22 28.6 21.3 36.5 20.8 50 21.2 55 19.4 57 19.5 56.5 17.7 57.3 17.9 63.8 17.8 70.5 17.3 72.3 17.4 74.8 16.7 78 17.2 76.9 18.2 79.4 17.9 81.4 17.6 78.2 17.7 74.2 17.8 73.9 17.9 68.6 18.1 70.8 18.2 68 30 88.3 1.3 66.5 median 17.9 Huawei Nova median 68.6 1.3 12.1 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Together with 4 GB of RAM and the. octa core SoC delivers high system performance and makes the Nova 2 an all-round device, which can smoothly run demanding web sites as well as graphically demanding Android games on its bright Full HD display. Further advantages are long battery runtimes, short charging times, and relatively large free storage, even if Huawei's EMUI user interface takes up quite a bit of its storage capacity.. Despite its 20 MP front camera, the Nova 2 is not a "Selfie Superstar" as Huawei calls it. It offers solid, but not outstanding camera performance.. You can only use the dual SIM feature of the Nova 2 if you dispense with using a microSD card, since it comes with a hybrid slot. This is not a serious problem, since the internal storage space might not fill quickly. You might also get over the fact that the USB Type-C port supports only 2.0 speed. Unfortunately, the modestly fast Wi-Fi is not a really good alternative for faster data transfers to the smartphone. The camera was also slightly disappointing. It simply cannot fulfil the high expectations.. Huawei Nova 2 - 2017-10-02 10/02/2017 v6 Manuel Masiero. Read all 2 comments / answer.

The lowest price of HUAWEI nova 2i is P13,000 at Lazada, which is 98% less than the cost of nova 2i at cmkcellphones (P698,893.66).. The latest price of HUAWEI nova 2i was updated on Feb 26, 2018, 11:08.. Hands-on Huawei Nova 2i or Huawei Maimang 6 launched in Thailand. Huawei Nova 2i hands-on by TechNave.Com. , Octa-Core (4xCortex-A53 2.36GHz + 4xCortex-A53 1.7GHz). , 4G: LTE DL , LTE UL. Huawei's new midrange wonder, the Nova 2i, has had an impressive reception since its announcement and launch, but how does it compare to another favorite value-for-the-money phone, the Xiaomi Mi A1? Let's find out.. Huawei has really been working hard to put out some very impressive smartphones this year. Their latest midrange effort, the Huawei Nova 2i, looks like one of the best camera phones you can get at this price range. Are we ready to crown the Nova 2i as the new king of midrange camera smartphones? Let's compare it to another very strong contender: the Xiaomi Mi A1.. The Huawei Nova 2i sports a 5.9-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 2160 x 1080, sporting the popular 18:9 aspect ratio. It's powered by a Kirin 659 chipset, with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage. The dual-camera setup comprises of a 16-megapixel camera paired with a 2-megapixel setup, with an LED flash. The front camera is 13 megapixels.. The Xiaomi Mi A1 on the other hand has a smaller 5.5-inch IPS LCD display with full HD 1080p resolution with Corning Gorilla Glass protection. The chipset is a Snapdragon 625, with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage. The A1's camera setup is a dual 12-megapixel pair of lenses and dual-LED flash. The front camera is 5 megapixels.. Just taking a look at the hardware, the Nova 2i has an edge in just about every aspect. The Snapdragon in the Mi A1 is marginally better the Kirin 659 at synthetic benchmarks, but in actual use most users won't notice. Both have metal bodies with powder coat finishes, and have about the same dimensions and weight.. Left: Huawei Nova 2i | Right: Xiaomi Mi A1. Display-wise, when you have both phones side by side, the Nova 2i's larger display with higher resolution immediately gives it the edge. But as you compare both, you'll find that the Mi A1, while having a higher brightness rating, doesn't have as crisp or strong a display and the Nova 2i definitely has the superior screen not just in size, but also in quality.. Left: Huawei Nova 2i | Right: Xiaomi Mi A1. The most important test, though, is the camera. How do the two phones compare when taking shots? Well, taking test images side by side you'll find the image quality is great on both sides, but the Nova 2i definitely has the better color contrast and accuracy along with details. The Mi A1 has a 2x telephoto lens but no OIS. On the whole, the Nova 2i is better with HDR, low-light shots, image stabilization, and just about everything else.. Huawei has a real winner here with the Nova 2i. It costs PHP 14,990 now locally, while the Mi A1 goes for PHP 13,995. You do get a lot of value here.
