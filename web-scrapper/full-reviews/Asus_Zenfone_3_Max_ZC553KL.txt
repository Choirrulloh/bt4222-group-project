Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) Review. Roydon Cerejo , 09 November 2016. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The ZenFone 3 Max features a metal unibody and full-HD display. Camera and battery performance is good but the SoC is underpowered. The Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) is priced at Rs. Taking a cue from Gionee’s Marathon series of smartphones, Asus introduced a new ZenFone Max model at the start of this year. The focus was on delivering the maximum possible battery life without making too many. The result was a decent package. that balanced performance and price well enough, while still delivering its key objective. A few months later, we had a refreshed model, simply called the. ( Review ), which added a bit more processing power while maintaining the long battery life. Both were still entry-level offerings though, and now Asus diversifying the Max series and bumping it up to the mid-range segment with two new models with very similar names – the ZenFone 3 Max (ZC520TL) which sits in the sub-Rs. 15,000 price bracket and the ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) , which resides in the sub-Rs.20,000 segment. The ZC520TL variant features a smaller 5.2-inch, 720p display; a MediaTek SoC and 13-megapixel and 5-megapixel cameras whereas the higher priced model features a larger, 1080p display, Qualcomm SoC and 16-megapixel and 8-megapixel cameras.. We have the latter of the pair. This price bracket has some really good value-for-money. such as the Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime. ( Review ), both of which offer tremendous performance and features under Rs. In fact, Asus’s very own ZenFone 3 Laser ( Review ) can be found for just a bit more than the ZC553KL’s Rs. Asus ZenFone 3 Max design and build The design is one of the first things that will catch your attention. It’s not as busy as the other higher-end ZenFone 3 models, yet. It feels sturdy too when you hold it, which is partly thanks to the unibody aluminium chassis. The grip is ergonomic and the buttons lined up nicely against our thumb. Asus has gone with a 5.5-inch full-HD IPS display which fixes one of the. biggest gripes we had with its predecessors. It produces sharp pictures, and brightness is very good, even under direct sunlight. The slim bezel reduces the width of the phone, thereby making it a little easier to use with one hand. There’s also a one-handed mode which you can activate in case you wish to do some serious typing on the move. Fingerprints aren’t much of an issue as there’s an oleophobic coating on the glass. What's dissapointing though, is that there isn't any form of scratch protection for the display, which is something we usually take for granted in this price segment.. The ZC553KL is a hybrid dual-SIM phone, which is a bit of a letdown considering the previous model had true dual-SIM functionality. You can opt for a microSD card of up to 128GB in place of the second SIM. There’s a mono speaker on the bottom, just next to the Micro-USB charging port, while the headphones socket is placed on the top. There’s a notification LED in the front and capacitive navigation buttons below the screen, which annoyingly, aren’t backlit. Around the back, we have a. You can use it to answer incoming calls, launch the camera app, or take a picture - but you can’t use it to lock apps or hide files. The bigger issue here is that fingerprint recognition was often not quick. fingerprints, which is flagged by a slight vibration, but it seemed more to do with the hardware not being able to authenticate fingerprints quickly. The issue was intermittent but was really frustrating when we ran into. Asus has done a commendable job in shedding the series’ budget image with the new Max. It looks and feels premium and has a much better display which we definitely appreciate. It’s not the slimmest phone around at 8.3mm, and is quite heavy at 175g, although you really don’t feel the heft too much when you carry it around. The phone ships with a headset, a 10W charger, a data cable, and an OTG cable. You also get 100GB of Google Drive space free for two years as a promotion.. Asus ZenFone 3 Max specifications and features The last ZenFone Max model used a Snapdragon 615 SoC, so naturally, we expected the new one to feature at least a Snapdragon 652 or a 625. Unfortunately, Asus has gone with the octa-core Snapdragon 430, just like with the ZenFone 3 Laser, which is disappointing. This chip handles day-to-day tasks pretty well but lacks punch when it comes to heavy apps and games. Even Asus’s ZenUI keyboard starts lagging after a while. In benchmarks, the ZenFone 3 Max performs similarly to its predecessor. We got 43,573 points in AnTuTu; 9326 points in 3DMark Ice Storm; and 16fps in GFXbench’s T-Rex graphics test. The GPU is the weakest link here, and that means you can’t play heavy games like Dead Effect 2 smoothly, with all the settings cranked up. The phone also has 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, single-band Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, FM radio, and GPS. There’s 4G support on Band 1, 3, 5, 8, and 40 in India as well as VoLTE.. Software is handled by Android Marshmallow but with Asus’s own treatment called ZenUI 3.0. The skin is a bit too much for our taste,. and will probably be daunting for someone who’s never used an Asus phone. There are tons of customisation options. The ‘Themes’ app has some decent free themes to choose from and there are also several utilities that come preinstalled and are pretty much identical to those we’ve discussed in our ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) review. The Mobile Manager app is one of the more useful ones, letting you manage notifications, clean up unused files and manage permissions for apps – all in one place. You also get apps like Instagram and Puffin, and games like Need for Speed: No Limits and SimCity pre-installed. The ZenFone 3 Max has what is called the Game Genie toolbar, which can be set to activate automatically in whatever game you choose. You can then use it to close background apps for better framerates, record or stream gameplay live to YouTube or Twitch, or search the Web for guides and walkthrough videos for the game. Asus ZenFone 3 Max performance We used the ZenFone 3 Max for the better part of a week and never really faced any major issues. The phone runs pretty smoothly for general tasks and some multitasking. It doesn’t have any overheating issues either, whether it is gaming or using the camera. The earpiece has good volume level and 4G works well.. Videos look really good thanks to the vibrant display, and the phone handles high-bitrate videos just fine, at up to 1080p. Audio performance is particularly good through wired and wireless headphones. The volume can get really loud and audio has good separation with punchy bass. Even the bundled headset does a really good job at isolating ambient noise and delivering a good audio experience. The AudioWizard app lets you play around with equaliser settings in order to fine-tune the sound. Asus's ZenFone Max models have always fared well in the camera department and the same story continues here. The 16-megapixel sensor and f/2.0 aperture lens result in detailed landscapes and macros in daylight. Colour reproduction is fairly accurate too although we could have used a bit more sharpness in captured images, especially around the edges of objects. In the macro shot sample below, notice that the edges of the flower. are a bit fuzzy when seen at full size. Low-light shots look good, with little noise, and the low-light shooting mode really helps here.. Tap to see full-sized Asus ZenFone 3 Max camera samples. Recorded 1080p video looks really good too. There’s electronic stabilisation for video but only at 720p resolution. The front 8-megapiexel camera captures some pretty detailed selfies under good lighting and you get various different effects and shooting modes including HDR.. Manual mode lets you push the shutter speed all the way up to 32 seconds, which we don’t see too often in smartphones. Super Resolution mode essentially stiches four instances of the same scene together, resulting in a much higher resolution image. Focusing is quick thanks to the laser autofocus and PDAF, and pictures are saved nearly instantly, unless you’re in a special mode. Battery life has been the hallmark feature of the Max series and it still is, but it's not as impressive as we had hoped. Our HD video loop test ran for 14 hours and 7 minutes, which is really good but we’ve seen similar results (or better) from phones with more powerful SoCs and smaller batteries. With actual heavy usage, we easily got through up to day and half. There are customisable power modes which can automatically kick in at designated times of the day. There’s no fast charging but the 10W charger manages to top up the phone in a couple of hours. charging another device with the ZenFone 3 Max. is also possible using the bundled OTG adapter. Verdict The ZenFone Max name no longer means you're getting a one-trick pony, as this new model aims to offer a well-rounded solution to aspiring smartphone buyers. This shows in the new aesthetics, improved display and cameras, and of course, solid battery life. It would have made a perfect rival to Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 3, but Asus has priced the ZenFone 3 Max in line with higher aspirations. ZC520TL variant does fall in the Redmi's price range but it doesn't seem to match up to it, at least on paper. It's also important that you check the model number behind the box carefully as its easy to confuse the two versions.. At Rs.17,999, the ZC553KL feels a little out of place. It’s also priced oddly close to its own sibling, the ZenFone 3 Laser. Asus only recently introduced the Laser into the market, and it now feels a bit redundant as the Max is better looking and has longer battery life, with similar performance. Also, unlike the Laser, the ZenFone 3 Max will be available offline too, which might somewhat explain its higher cost.. However, it's hard to overlook the use of an entry-level SoC for a phone of this calibre, which is a real shame since we feel that Asus wouldn’t have lost much in terms of battery performance even with a Snapdragon 625, and the pricing would have made a lot more sense. If you’re not into gaming and don’t mind forgoing some modern essentials like Wi-Fi 802.11ac, then the ZenFone 3 Max is still a good package. It’s just tough to recommend at its launch price..

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Like the entire ZenFone lineup, the ASUS ZenFone 3 is a decent smartphone. However, even with the premium pitch, thereâs no stand out factor running for it. It looks good on paper, but the real-world performance is limited â and would only meet the demands of less discerning users.. Operating System Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with ZenUI 3.0. Display 5.5-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS. Processor 1.4GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 430. Internal Storage 32GB; expandable up to 128GB with microSD card. Rear Camera 16MP | f/2.0 aperture | Dual-LED flash. Front Camera 8MP | f/2.2 aperture | 84-degree wide-angle lens. Dimensions 151.4 x 76.24 x 8.3mm. ASUS has a crowded ZenFone line-up, but the company buckets its offerings in well-rounded categories. Like the ZenFone Max, with a focus on marathon battery life.. However, since last year with the launch of ZenFone 3 portfolio, the Taiwanese company has upped the ante in design and positioning and instead of focusing on hardware specifications, aims to bring premium experience to its users. That also means that most of their latest phones are not exactly run-of-the-mill value-for-money devices, but differentiate themselves in design, camera, battery life, etc.. ASUS launched the first ZenFone Max in 2015, and while it delivered on its USP of long battery life, it brought nothing else to the table. The follow-up version had more memory and faster processor, but both devices were chunky plastic smartphones that didnât impress many.. However, the ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) aims to change that with a well-rounded smartphone experience coupled with premium design, while continuing the focus on battery life. Is ASUS third time lucky with the Max? Letâs find out.. ASUS has finally brought an all-metal design to the ZenFone series, later than when most people wouldâve liked. Even entry-level budget smartphones in 2016 boasted of an all-metal design. Thereâs nothing extraordinary about the design, but neither is it run-of-the-mill.. The homogenous design language of the ZenFone series is apparent, a premium one at that, bringing the flagship design to the budget smartphone. It is well-built and the aluminum chassis gives it a solid feel. Itâs not very slippery, yet, since it is an all-metal phone, youâd have to get used to the smoothness and take care of the phone slipping out of the hand.. Unlike the original ZenFone Max, this one is not a brick and neither does it sport big bezels (it couldâve had even smaller bezels though, on top and bottom) and boasts of a pretty good 73 per cent screen-to-body ratio. Itâs not very slim at 8.33mm, and at 175 grams, itâs not the lightest smartphone out there. Yet it is one of the lighter phones to pack a big battery and a large display, and you wouldnât feel the heft lugging it around. Also, the gradual curves and rounded corners make it a very comfortable and ergonomic phone to hold, and it is easily pocketable unless you canât stand larger smartphones.. The ZenFone 3 Max sports a 5.5-inch Full HD IPS display with a pixel density of 401 ppi. The display is sharp and the 400 nits brightness is very good, offering great sunlight visibility.. The contrast ratio is not exceptional though, and if youâre a fan of vibrant, and even over-saturated AMOLED displays, like I am, this one is just average. Viewing angles on the phone are, however, quite good. There is a little color shift when viewing it from extreme angles, but thatâs the case with most smartphones.. Powered by a 1.4Ghz Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor paired with 3GB of RAM, the ZenFone 3 Max chugs along nicely while multitasking offering a smooth Android experience.. However, if you stress the hardware, the phone tends to stutter a bit. Youâd be unable to play graphic-intensive games at maxed-out settings and experience frequent frame-drops. Interestingly, it never gets too hot to handle even when the performance is stretched to its modest limits. However, youâd experience some lag in navigation and switching between apps in that case.. Clearly, the device is geared towards casual smartphone users â and that is where it excels. However, I think the company could squeeze some extra juice from its internals with better software optimization. Some other phones in the market tend to offer smoother experience with similar hardware specifications.. Of course, the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance of the ZenFone 3 Max is its long battery life. There has been a drop in the battery capacity of the Max this time around (to go away from that chunky size), however, the 4100 mAh battery – with the hardware it packs and the software optimizations that ASUS has done â still manages to offer phenomenal battery life. With basic to moderate usage, I was easily able to get two days battery life on the phone, which is quite good. You can stretch that, and coupled with power saving features, can even squeeze more than that!. The ZenFone 3 Max comes with 32GB of internal memory, further expandable by up to 128GB via a microSD card slot. The dual SIM smartphones features a hybrid slot, so you can either use the second SIM or the microSD card, but not both.. The phone supports reverse charging, and can be used to charge other devices via OTG. Thereâs a bundled OTG adapter in the box. For a smartphone with a focus on battery life, itâs a shame that it doesnât support fast charging. It ships with a regular charger, which takes painfully long to charge the big battery completely.. The fingerprint scanner can be used to answer incoming calls, launch the camera app, or take a picture, but is not quick enough. While the recognition is just fine, the authentication is a tad slow or requires slight pressure of the finger. Also, the capacitive keys on the front are not backlit. Of course, with impulse you get used to tapping the finger or thumb at the right place but sometimes it gets a tad annoying, especially in the dark or when youâre not holding the phone as you do usually.. The ZenFone 3 Max sports a 16-megapixel rear camera with f/2.0 aperture, Phase Detection Autofocus and laser auto-focus, Electronic Image Stabilization for shooting videos, and dual-LED flash.. Outdoors in daylight, the camera performs very well and takes sharp pictures with good details. The color reproduction is mostly accurate. Although the pictures are generally noise-free, zooming them reveals pixilation which is more pronounced when I viewed them on a 40-inch display. For most people though, who just share photos on social media, this shouldnât be a problem.. Indoors or in low-light conditions, the night mode is a mixed bag. Some of the shots give great results, better than auto mode, however, several times, theyâd end up very noisy with messed up metering.. The camera focusses nicely and quickly, although there is a definite shutter lag and often Iâd end up with a blurry photo when I was attempting to take a shot of a moving subject.. On the front, there is an 8-megapixel camera with f/2.2 aperture that manages to click detailed selfies even in tricky lighting.. The camera app on the Zenfone 3 Max is the same as on the companyâs flagship ZenFone 3 smartphone. While the options are great to tinker around, including a manual mode, the camera on the ZenFone 3 Max is just above average.. The ASUS ZenFone 3 runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box with the new version of the companyâs proprietary ZenUI 3.0 on top of it. Virtually, every nook and corner of the Android experience gets a fresh coat of paint.. Right up, thatâs a good thing. The older versions of ZenUI were plagued with bloatware and gimmicky UI elements that marred the overall user experience. The latest version is a complete makeover, and offers a clean UI with subtle animations. There are several nifty utilities, but thereâs still a plethora of ASUS-branded apps that Iâve hardly seen anyone using really. Unfortunately, only a few of these can be uninstalled and while you can disable most others, they still occupy storage space on your phone.. ZenUI 3.0 features an app drawer, and thereâs a built-in search functionality. You can swipe down the screen and search the Web or your apps and contacts, and view your frequently used apps. Thereâs an all-new Theme Store from which users can download free as well as paid themes, wallpapers, icons, and ringtones to customize their smartphone.. One of the neat features of the ZenUI is ZenMotion which allows configuring a variety of touch and motion gestures like double tap to wake or flipping the phone when you get an incoming call to enable silent mode. It also allows you to enable the one-handed mode that shrinks the display to one corner of the screen for easy, one-handed usage when youâre on the move.. Of course, the most useful app from the entire ZenUI suite is the Mobile Manager. With slick animations and intuitive UI, the app offers quick ways to free RAM and storage space, and manage apps as well as app permissions. Itâs a sort of one-stop destination for managing your phoneâs performance.. The latest version of ZenUI on the ZenFone 3 is fluid and aims to offer stock Android-like experience while adding additional functionalities. And, it succeeds in doing that. Itâs one of the better UIs out there in terms of ease of use and feels polished. Better internals wouldâve made it even smoother on the ZenFone 3 Max. But the excess of bloatware is disappointing, and shows that the company has learnt nothing from similar criticism in the past.. The ZenFone 3 Max aims to pimp up the Max range with a premium design. It succeeds there, but thereâs little else.. Like the entire ZenFone lineup, the ASUS ZenFone 3 is a decent smartphone. However, even with the premium pitch, thereâs no stand out factor running for it. It looks good on paper, but the real-world performance is limited â and would only meet the demands of less discerning users. Yes, thereâs the fantastic battery life, and thatâs the sole reason one should go for this device. Else, even looking within, there are better ZenFone siblings around.. ASUS isn’t officially selling the ZenFone 3 Max in the US, but in India, the device is priced at â¹17,999 ($265) â a tad higher than what everyone wouldâve liked. At this price, it feels a little out of place. What do you think of the ZenFone 3 Max, and do you plan to buy one? Let us know your views in the comments below!. ASUS , ASUS Zenfone 3 Max.

Explosive Battery Power and Efficient Performance:. ASUS ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) Philippines Market Review:. ASUS ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) has a price range falling just in between the higher-ends and mid-ranging devices. But it boasts multiple features which buyers will only expect from top-end devices along with a few more exclusive ones inside.. Few consumer product markets show a higher competition between products than smartphones. There are numerous manufacturers all vying for the top spot on the sales sheets. But there are simply too many things offerings on the market. So, the most important thing becomes standing out. And that is just what this ASUS ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) does, stand out.. What makes a device better is not the hardware but the software too. ASUS ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) does have a huge non-removable 4100 mAh battery, but the manufacturers integrate proper supportive software to juice this battery from every way possible.. Standard stand-by times come in at around 38 days 4G along with 17 hours of 3G talk-time and an additional 2 hours while Wi-Fi browsing. But the icings on the cake are two efficiency-enhancing software apps in-built as hardware drivers. These setups allow this device to extend 10% charge stand-by times to a mammoth 30 hours.. But the battery alone does not do the trick. Inside, this ASUS ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) intelligently integrates a Qualcomm MSM8937 Snapdragon 430 series chipset running an Octa-core Cortex-A53 along with an Adreno 505 GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). This setup is all about multi-tasking and concentrates more on resourceful performance than one single-core power.. Clock speeds come in at 1.4 GHz which might seem a bit underwhelming in comparison to other devices in this price range. But this device can easily and comprehensively complete functions on its display, coming to which later.. ASUS ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) comes with a camera setup which is easily above average comparing to other devices in the segment. The primary one is an excellent 16 MP setup with a f/2.0 aperture, PDAF with Laser, Dual-LED flash and a stand-alone 1/3-inch sensor.. With all these hardware, this camera can achieve 0.03 seconds Laser AF. Still images and videos gain an upper-hand thanks to 3-Axis EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) and 6-Direction EIS compensation.. But this device has a surprise in store inside, something which has more to do with software support over the hardware. This ASUS device comes with their in-house PixelMaster software enabling an HDR (High Dynamic Range) mode. With this, a buyer can take 64 MP Super Resolution stills of incomparable quality – an industry-leading feature which a buyer needs to use to believe.. Coming to the display module, ASUS ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) packs quite a punch with this 5.5 inch IPS LCD setup. The 2.25 mm slim bezels help it dominate the front fascia. It is also sharing a mammoth 77.5% size ratio with the body. But where it actually notches up quite a lot of pointers is with its FHD (1920 x 1080 pixels) resolutions at 401 PPI (Pixels Per Inch). With a 2.5D Arc Glass up top, this module rates as among the best sub 6-inch FHD displays around and definitely among the best ones in this price range.. ASUS ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) runs on an Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. There are chances that ASUS might include an Android 7.1.1 Nougat later on.. ZenUI 3.0 adds more value to this device. This popular User Interface works above the stock Android to provide additional and engaging user experience.. Internal Storage configuration comes in at 32 GB. There are multiple RAM configurations though - 2 GB, 3 GB all the way to 4 GB.. ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) comes with a fingerprint scanner on the rear panel with 0.3 seconds and 5 fingers recognition.. There is no doubt that this is a high value-for-features offering in this segment. For buyers looking for a device with above average battery and camera specs, this is easily among the better ones of the lot. And there's much more in this ASUS ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) to leave no room for complaint.. Reviews of ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC553KL. User Review : 2 Reviews.

News Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) Review. Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) Review. The Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) offers power optimization and great battery life. Updated: November 17, 2016 5:14 PM IST. Asus’ ZenFone range can be a bit confusing at times, primarily because of the number of different devices and product codes. phone fits into a specific niche, and Asus indeed has something for everyone on offer. At the beginning of this year, Asus launched the battery-centric ZenFone Max, which received a slight refresh in June in the form of the ZenFone Max (2016). And now we have the Asus ZenFone 3 Max, which is available in two variants.. Today, I’m reviewing the larger and more expensive of the two variants from Asus, the ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL). Featuring the same design language of the rest of the ZenFone 3 range, the Max comes with a large 4,100mAh battery and a focus on power efficiency. Priced at Rs 17,999, the phone offers a combination of looks, specifications and above-average battery life. Take a look at our review of the Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) to find out how it fares.. Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) Design. One of the most notable changes in the ZenFone 3 range this year is the use of metal, and the ZenFone 3 Max is no different. It features a metal unibody, with slim silver antenna lines near the top and bottom. All the edges of the phone are rounded, which gives the phone a great feel in the hand. It comes with a hybrid SIM tray, with the option to have either two SIM cards (nano + micro) or one micro-SIM and one microSD card for expandable storage.. The right side of the phone has the power and volume buttons, the bottom has the microUSB port and speaker grille, while the top has the 3.5mm jack. The use of the micro-USB port at a time when most phone manufacturers are switching to USB Type-C comes as a bit of a surprise, but we don’t really mind considering vast majority of smartphones still use the micro-USB standard, making it easier to charge the phone wherever you are, or use it to reverse charge other devices using an OTG cable. The ZenFone 3 Max also supports reverse charging, and even comes with an OTG cable in the box to make it easy to do this.. The phone has a 5.5-inch full-HD screen, which occupies a significant 72.3 percent of the front. It’s a decent screen in terms of sharpness, but the colors do appear a bit unnatural and over saturated. However, it’s very bright, and we had no issues with sunlight legibility. Right below the screen are the three Android software keys, which are in the form of capacitive buttons rather than on-screen keys. Unfortunately, the keys aren’t backlit, so it can be a bit difficult finding the right key when using the phone in the dark.. The ZC553KL variant is most similar in appearance to the Asus ZenFone 3 Laser, which was launched in India last month , and is a massive improvement in looks over previous ZenFone devices in our opinion. However, the metal chassis is prone to scuffs and nicks, so it’s advisable to use the phone with a protective case.. Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) Specifications. Apart from the difference in screen size and resolution (the more affordable ZC520TL variant has a 5.2-inch HD screen), the ZenFone 3 Max has some other notable differences, the biggest of which is its use of the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 SoC. The Snapdragon 400 series has always been one of Qualcomm’s go-to options for affordable devices, with a focus on power efficiency. Naturally, this comes at the cost of performance, which I’ll talk about in detail later in this review.. There’s also 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage (expandable by up to 128GB using a microSD card) and 4G LTE with VoLTE support. As previously mentioned, the phone has a large 4,100mAh battery, which while notably less than the previous editions of the ZenFone Max series, is still quite a large battery in its own right. The process of charging the phone is unfortunately still a bit slow, with the phone taking about three hours to charge with the bundled 10W charger. Although the Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 SoC is Quick Charge 3.0 compliant, Asus has bundled a slow charger with the phone, which comes across as a disappointment, especially considering the price.. Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) Software. The Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, with the company’s Zen UI layered on top. The interface has undergone some significant changes with the launch of the ZenFone 3 range, but is still fairly bloated thanks to its large list of pre-installed apps. While some third party apps and games can be uninstalled, a lot of Asus’ own apps can only be disabled. While some are genuinely useful, others are likely to just occupy space unnecessarily.. ZenUI’s general style and functioning remains the same as always, and the system of keeping key apps separate from the interface allows individual apps to be updated when needed, without forcing a larger system update. This keeps things efficient, but the clutter might bother some people. Apps such as Mobile Manager, Back-Up and Asus Web Storage are genuinely useful and do their bit to improve the phone and offer handy services. It’s an efficient interface as well, and we experienced no lag or crashes during our time with the device.. Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) Performance. The Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 SoC, despite being priced at a significant premium over the Snapdragon 650-powered Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. While this means that the ZenFone 3 Max doesn’t have the same raw-power-per-rupee as the Redmi Note 3, it does ensure battery efficiency thanks to the use of eight A53 cores clocked at a relatively low 1.4GHz. While definitely considered a low-end SoC, the chipset does strike a decent balance between performance and energy efficiency.. Most apps work fairly well, and we didn’t face any trouble in everyday use of the phone. While the difference in pure speed between the ZenFone 3 Max and my own powerhouse OnePlus 3 is certainly noticeable, it’s never too bothersome. I had the phone running on 4G network or Wi-Fi the entire time, and connectivity or Internet usage wasn’t often a problem. We did experience occasional bouts of stutter when playing graphically intensive games, but this usually normalized after a few seconds. Ordinary tasks such as phone calls, social media and web browsing, as well as multi-tasking with multiple apps running, are handled with ease most of the time, thanks to the 3GB of RAM under the hood.. There’s also a fingerprint sensor at the back of the phone, which can read up to five stored fingerprints. It’s usually accurate, works directly from standby without needing to first wake your phone, and doesn’t need too much effort to trigger when unlocking the phone, but it is a bit slow when it comes to actually unlocking. The fraction of a second between putting your finger on the sensor and the screen lighting up is quite clearly perceivable, and other competing phones offer a bit more in those departments.. The device does generate some heat when being used heavily, but this only has the device feeling slightly warm rather than uncomfortably hot. On the whole, performance is on-par with most devices under the Rs 10,000 mark, which makes us question Asus’ pricing strategy yet again.. Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) Camera. With a 16-megapixel rear and 8-megapixel front camera, the ZenFone 3 Max is above-average when it comes to camera specifications. There’s also an f/2.0 aperture, hybrid autofocus using phase detection and a laser, and up to full-HD video recording with both cameras. The camera app is a bit confusing at first, but has plenty of tweaks and settings to let you set the camera up to your preferences. When it comes to modes, the app offers most of the popular options, including HDR, time lapse and panorama, but we couldn’t locate a slow-motion video mode. Additionally, recording video is a one-step process, with a record button directly on the camera’s home screen.. The camera is a bit confusing, with images appearing sharp at first, but zooming in reveals that there is some grain visible in pictures taken even in ordinary daylight conditions. Focusing is quick regardless of whether you’re shooting objects up close or at a distance, with the laser and phase detection autofocus working well together to ensure that images are properly focused and correctly composed. colors tend to appear a bit dull and faded, and if we had to put our impressions of the camera in a single word, it would be ‘boring’.. [Click to see camera samples shot by the Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL)]. Video recording is acceptable as well in ordinary conditions, and pictures taken with the front camera are just about satisfactory in all conditions.. or tend to take most of your photos in good light, you won’t have too much trouble with the Asus ZenFone 3 Max. However, people that shoot often or take a lot of selfies are likely to be disappointed by the performance of the Asus ZenFone 3 Max.. Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) Battery. The Max sub-range has always been known for its above-average battery life, and the ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) is no different. Apart from having large batteries, the phones have also used hardware that is efficient to ensure that the battery life issue is adequately addressed. The range has always been for users who can’t or don’t want to charge their phones too often, and the ZenFone 3 Max sticks to that position effortlessly.. Asus has reduced the size of the battery, now using a 4,100mAh unit. However, this doesn’t have too much of an impact on battery life, and with careful use, it’s possible to get up to two full days of use on a single charge. Even with heavy use, a full charge will last you over a day-and-a-half, and it’s refreshing and satisfying to see the battery percentage drop slowly even while playing heavy games such as Asphalt Xtreme .. Additionally, there are software-based power saving modes, which disable some functions to stretch battery life on essential functions. A ‘Super Saving’ mode claims to offer 2.5 times as much battery time as the normal mode, by keeping only the phone, SMS and alarm functions active. You can also set schedules for power usage, or have the phone switch to Super Saving mode when the battery level drops under 10 percent. All of this will help you get the most out of a full charge.. What is noteworthy though, is the fact that the ZenFone 3 Max manages to remain power-efficient despite the fact that it has a large 5.5-inch full-HD screen to power. As such, the ZenFone 3 Max may not be able to run for as long as earlier Max phones, but it does succeed in offering a bit more in the form of performance and screen quality while remaining efficient on the whole.. While the first Asus ZenFone Max. was built to stretch its battery as far as possible, the ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) strikes a better balance between power-efficiency, performance and hardware quality. The Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) does have some weaknesses, including bloated software, only 23GB of usable internal storage, a camera that can be called average at best, and a charger that while not terrible, is certainly not the most ideal option considering the size of the phone’s battery. However, it is a decent looking smartphone that’s built well, and is likely to find takers thanks to its standout battery.. But priced at Rs 17,999, the ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) does not quite offer a bang for your buck. The use of Snapdragon 430 SoC for a smartphone at this price is quite baffling considering there are better performing phones such as the LeEco Le 2 , Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. and Motorola Moto G4 Plus. At around the same price as the ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL), you could also get the Lenovo Z2 Plus, which by far offers much better hardware and performance.. The biggest USP of the ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) is its battery, but that’s no longer unique with many smartphones offering stellar battery performance. We could have overlooked the specs-versus-price comparison if the smartphone offered something that others don’t. Unfortunately, that is not the case. At the end of the day, the ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) is a well-rounded smartphone that just got its pricing wrong.. Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) 5. Android 6.0 Marshmallow with ASUS ZenUI 3.0.

Asus Zenfone 3 Max (ZC553KL) comes with few attractive features such as 16 MP laser autofocus back camera, 5.5 inch large Full HD sharp and colourful display, 3 GB RAM, 32 GB ROM, 1.4 GHz octa-core CPU, 4G network support fingerprint sensor, fast battery charging and a durable and effective battery that can allow up to 912 hours standby time! All these features make Zenfone 3 Max a great choice. However, snapdragon 430 chipset won't provide the best support for smooth performance. That's one drawback for this phone.

Designed by the Taiwanese company, ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC553KL makes a great impression in the minds of Indian buyers with its premium looks and features packed in a budget price. It is truly a device looking to bring back cool in the smartphone market.. Asus has made a serious impact on the Indian smartphone market ever since its introduction. ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC553KL is no different. The phone looks to realise the hip factor among budget buyers with its impessive features and stunning design.. Here's a look at how it makes its mark:. Introduced with power as its USP, it houses a 4100 mAh battery which is good enough to last for two days with one full charge. Also, its five different power modes and PowerMaster Technology, make its battery lifespan two times better.. Studded with the flagship reverse charging feature that allows users to charge other devices with their ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC553KL, it is truly a heavy users' delight.. 2.5D curved glass is set upon a 5.5-inch FHD IPS display with a 2.25 mm slim bezel and 77.5% screen to body ratio. Designed for optimum viewing experience, this phone is an absolute delight for virtual reality fans.. An unlocking speed of 0.3 seconds paired with 5 finger recognition makes ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC553KL a vault you can carry. Also, the fingerprint sensor is sensitive enough to be used as a second shutter button when selfies are the mood of the hour.. Its 16 MP sensor f/2.0 PixelMaster camera is built to take high-resolution photos that will definitely make a place in your memorable albums. The front 8 MP camera is perfect for selfies whenever the need arises, in low light conditions or otherwise.. Paired with laser AF technology, ZenFone 3 Max ZC553KL clicks the sharpest images in true colours and poster size resolution.. Housed with an Octacore 64 bit CPU with Qualcomm S430 chipset and 3 GB RAM, ZenFone 3 Max ZC553KL provides its users with a lag-free performance every time. Now playing high-speed games is so much easier while working with social media apps.. Also, the phone's Game Genie feature allows users to run tips through pop-ups while playing.. Pairing a sleek design with a premium finish, this Asus handset fares well in the hands of buyers. In fact, the contoured finish paired with rounded edges makes it a buyer's delight.. Available in pink, gray, gold, and silver, Zenfone 3 Max chooses to go with all the popular colours; it gets the best market penetration possible.. However, like any other phone, this too has a few flaws that might not resonate with some consumers.. Lack of backlit capacitive keys limit the phone a little on its style factor.. With fast internet becoming cheaper by the day, no VoLTE is a definite downer.. Hybrid SIM trays might allow dual reception, but it compromises on the memory card.. Launched in November 2016, ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC553KL has hit all the right spots for Indian buyers on a budget. Its success has paved the way for Asus to gift their customers with more of such innovation.. Reviews of ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC553KL. Will you be the first reviewer of this product?

ASUS Zenfone 3 Max ZC553KL Review. Author Dhruv Bhutani Posted on November 8, 2016 November 8, 2016 Categories Asus , Reviews. Once again it is time for yet another Asus. The number of variants that the Taiwanese giant pushes out is perhaps second only to Samsung. For the most part, the company has focussed on meaningful differentiation with the Laser and Max series targeted towards. bringing elements from the Zenfone 3 to the mass market but with a sharp focus on the camera and battery capabilities respectively. We’ve already reviewed the Zenfone 3 and the Zenfone 3 Laser, today let’s take a look at the Zenfone 3 Max.. If you’ve seen one phone from the Asus Zenfone 3 line up, you have a pretty good idea of how all the others will look. You can argue that the homogeneity in design works well in the consumer’s favor. Indeed, the fact that you get a ‘premium’ design akin to the company flagship in a lower tier handset is certainly great. The Zenfone 3 Max however eschews the gorgeous glass and spun metal rear finish of the Zenfone 3.. The front fascia of the phone is nigh identical to the Zenfone 3 Laser save for the paint scheme. Where the laser had an all gold finish, the Max has a white front. While it is covered in protective Gorilla Glass, we found it to be exceptionally prone to scratches and you’ll want to be really careful with the hardware. Up above the screen is where you’ll find the usual array including the proximity sensor, 5MP front facing camera. Below the screen are three capacitive keys that correspond to back, home and menu. Once again, like the Zenfone 3 Laser, you’ll observe that there’s a subtle 2.5D curve to the front glass that runs around the edge of the screen and merges rather sharply with the rear panel of the phone. The bezels on either of the screen are rather insignificant but quite. substantial both above and below the screen.. On the right hand side of the phone is the volume rocker as well as the power button below it. Both the inputs offer great tactile feedback and were very responsive. In fact this is one feature that we usually like about Asus phones, they’re well built devices with good ergonomics and feedback. The left side includes the hybrid SIM slot while top and the bottom have the 3.5mm audio jack and the microUSB port respectively.. The back of the phone is plain. with some minimal Asus branding towards the bottom. The dual LED flash, camera and laser autofocus unit sit on the same plane with a very symmetric design. Above and along the bottom edge you’ll notice two antenna bands that fit in well with the design and of course, improve radio performance on the phone. A fingerprint scanner also sits here and proved to be both fast and accurate when placed against the competition. Through software, Asus has made the fingerprint scanner particularly useful. You can use a series of taps to activate functionality like answering calls, launching the camera and taking photos.. The Zenfone 3 Max measures 151.4 x 76.24 x 8.3mm and weighs about 175grams making it a pretty lightweight handset despite the large display. The phone continues to be pocketable though we wouldn’t mind smaller bezels along the top and bottom. Overall though, the phone is ergonomically sound and unless you have an instant dislike for larger devices, you’ll find that it sits very well in your hand.. Like several generations of Asus devices, our concerns with the software mostly center around the tremendous amount of bloat on the phone. Running Zen UI 3.0 based on Android 6.0.1, the phone is a cornucopia of colors and hues and has. an approachable albeit a bit juvenile take on Android skins.. The interface paradigm is fairly standard, just the way we prefer it. The lock screen allows for customizable shortcuts in addition to the camera launcher, clock. You can obviously view notifications here.. Like we’ve talked about earlier, the home screen is very customizable and let’s you change theme packs and more. Unlike many Chinese competitors, the phone does not get rid of the app drawer which is certainly welcome. Within the app launcher, we like the capabilities on offer including the automatic sorting of installed apps.. As for the pre-installed applications, there’s close to 26 of these and includes everything from weather, movie maker, photo collage apps and more. Now we’re not saying that these are bad apps, far from that. We’re a bit surprised by how robust these apps tend to be but preinstalling these takes up precious space. Additionally, it isn’t always possible to delete these and the best you can do is to disable them.. For what it’s worth, there’s a few nifty additions like the Audio Wizard that can tweak system audio based on the scenario that you are in. A laser ruler app makes use of the laser autofocus module to act as a rangefinder though the accuracy is a bit suspect. More importantly, the software is quite well optimized, offers some interesting additions but the heavy handed pre bundling on the hardware is something we could have gone without.. The phone is powered by a 1.4Ghz Snapdragon 430 processor paired with an Adreno 505 GPU. In addition there’s 4GB of RAM which is more than sufficient for multitasking on a device of this calibre. Performance is as you’d expect and general tasks sail through smoothly. Zen UI continues to delight with its level of refinement and how well it pairs. with the hardware on hand to offer a super slick and smooth experience. Stress the hardware though and things are a bit different. With a Snapdragon 430 processor, graphic heavy use is really not the phone’s forte. High end games result in a bit of frame drop. The phone also heats up in such use case scenarios. This is a phone that is more optimized for communications and general use than for someone who craves performance and you should temper your expectations accordingly. We’ve included a few comparative benchmarks below that place the Zenfone 3 Max against the competition.. The Zenfone 3 Max scores 43577 points in the AnTuTu benchmark.. In the Geekbench 3 Multi Core benchmark, the phone scores 2001 points.. In Geekbench 3, the Asus Zenfone 3 Max scored last where it practically tied with the similarly specced Zenfone 3 Laser.. The display on the Zenfone 3 is a Full HD IPS panel. Stretched across to 5.5 inches, it delivers a pixel density of 401 ppi. The resolution is perfectly at home on a panel of that size and as such, icons and graphic elements look tack sharp. The contrast ratio here is a bit tame and makes colors look a bit muted so you shouldn’t really expect the vibrant and slightly over-saturated colors you see on AMOLED panels.. Brightness levels top off at 400 nits which while the highest around is absolutely sufficient to allow for great sunlight visibility. Viewing angles on the phone are good with a very mild color shift when viewing it from extreme angles.All in all, the display is about par for the course and delivers the goods.. The camera module on the Zenfone 3 Max has a 1/3” sensor with a resolution of 16 megapixels. An f/2.0 aperture lens is placed in front of this. As we mentioned earlier, a Dual LED flash and laser autofocus module are placed on either side of the camera. The front camera has a resolution of 8 megapixels and has an f/2.2 lens. The camera software in particular is very robust.. The camera app on the Zenfone 3 Max offers the full range of software options that are available on the company’s high end Zenfone 3. This includes a manual mode that allows you to adjust exposure, ISO and more. Unfortunately despite all those options, the camera is pretty average to say the least.. In broad day light, the camera on the Zenfone 3 Max performed about as you’d expect. Images are sharp and mostly noise free though zooming in close reveals a lot of noise reduction artifacts. We liked that the camera managed to focus very well even when very close to the subject. On many occasions the camera had issues with getting the white balance right at first shot. This is particularly visible in the first two shots of the gallery above. The camera also had a tendency to underexpose at times. When it worked though, the camera was quite decent and we feel that Asus will be able to fix these issues with a future software update.. The Zenfone 3 Max is equipped with the same connectivity options as all the other Zenfone devices and. there’s not much to set it aside. infrared port so you won’t be able to use the phone for controlling appliances. You do get 4G LTE support as well as WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1 and GPS. There is 32GB of storage and you can expand that via a microSD card. Owing to the Hybrid SIM slot, you can either use both SIM cards or a single SIM and microSD.. pièce de résistance ie the battery life. Compared to the previous generation Zenfone Max, there has been a drop in battery capacity. The 4100 mAh battery on offer though is still absolutely enormous and pairing it with the more frugal processor, you should still get phenomenal battery life. Realistically, with multiple email accounts and social profiles as well as shooting a fair bit of photo samples, we were still able to get two days of use out of the phone. This is right in line with Xiaomi’s Redmi series of phones and understandably so given the similar spec sheet.. The Zenfone 3 Max is quite a decent smartphone and this is something that can be said for the entire Zenfone range. It however lacks a differentiating factor. In fact even within it’s own product lineup, Asus would find it hard to set the Max aside given that phones like the Zenfone 3 Laser too have really good battery life.. If amazing battery life is a key criteria you should probably take a look at the Zenfone 3 Max. That said, it faces very still. competition from the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 and Redmi Prime which offer similar specs, performance and battery life for a lower price point..

ASUS Zenfone 3 Max (ZC553KL) Battery drain. Last edited by elizespmma17 on 2017/2/13 18:57. I just bought my asus zenfone 3 max (ZC553KL) this last feb. I've been using it for 1 week now and i have noticed that the battery drains quite a lot fast when using the mobile data. It drains 1% in 2-4 mins of using mobile data. It drops my battery percentage down to 70% on only using mobile data not even half the day. I thought that it could last a day or two with average uses. But I guess it does not drain much battery when the screen is off. Is this really the capability of the battery life 4100 mAh that the phone provides or it can be fixed through upcoming system updates? I hope that the android nougat update can provide much less battery consumption. can you provide me with better options on how to improve battery life?. Per our experience, mobile data easily drains battery life. Average usage is usually measured through WiFi or mixed mobile data/WiFi use, not continuous mobile data usage. To prolong your battery life, turn off unnecessary features and lower the brightness setting.. You need to login first Login | Register Now.
