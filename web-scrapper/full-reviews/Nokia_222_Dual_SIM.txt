I liked it for its great battery backup, nice look, light weight. But this time I was very much disappointed with service of Amazon. It took too long to confirm and ship the product.

PRO: L-am achizitionat de cateva luni si pot sa zic ca isi face treaba superb.... Pot sa zic ca uit sa-l mai incarc, bateria tine cel putin o saptamana jumate... Daca vorbesc normal la el in sensu ca nu toata ziua buna ziua cu el la ureche. Sunetul in difuzor in timul conv este superb iar cand suna il auzi fara probleme si in cea mai aglomerata incapere... Eu unul lucrez in hala industriala prelucrare metale feroase si stau langa masina de debitat teava si sincer il aud fara probleme... Nu mai zic ca cei de la EMAG punctuali fara doar si poate(tineti-o tot asa EMAG sunteti cei mai tari) CONTRA: chiar nimic..... Acest telefon nu a avut casti.... Adaugat de Badita Marius. Se aude foarte tare, bateria ţine foarte mult, super ok. L-am luat pentru mama soacră şi este foarte încântată. Am achizitionat acest telefon de cateva saptamani si sunt foarte multumit de el. La ce pret are camera este decente, design frumos, dual sim, suporta card destul de mare, dar cel mai important la acest telefon este durata bateriei cu care am deposit o saptamana si mai avea 50%. E un telefon care face ceea ce trebuie sa faca un telefon, impecabil.. Adaugat de Lunca Andreea Raluca. Nu e poate regla nici tonul si nici volumul la alarmele din calendar, nu se poate face zoom la poze. La banii astia multe mai vrei:)))). Adaugat de Gavrila Eugen. Hahahahahah la 150 RON ai pretenti, e bine sa le ai dar nu in cazul asta:). Adaugat de Bolog Vlad. Da nu vrei sa si filmeze 5 ore ca un s7?. Adaugat de Cosmin-mihai Musat. Zoom la care poze? Alea de 2 MP? Hai sa fim seriosi, doar nu ai cumparat telefonulasta sa faci poze cu el..... Ce tare! Am ras doua zile. Am un nokia x2 dual-sim, este un feature phone cu cam de toate (inclusiv java => opera mini si facebook), inclusiv zoom la poze (da, imi trebuie zoom sa vad si eu ce se vede de fapt in poza, daca fotografiez un anunt vazut pe strada sau o pagina de text vreau sa vad daca mi-a ieshit bine sau nu), singurul defect pe care-l are e ca in calengar highlght-ul la zilele cu alarme este mierabil, practic insesizabil, dar in rest e beton telefonul. Deci nu rade, 2mpx este o rezolutie mai mare decat a unui ecran de laptop titpc, vreau sa pot sa vad daca pot sa citesc ce am fotografiat ca sa pot sa refac poza daca nu a ieshit bine. Perfect; butoane late, se apasa usor; carcasa siliconata - nu aluneca din mana!. Doream sa inlocuiesc un Nokia 6300 din 2007. Ei bine, desi este ceva mai mare, are ceva nebunii in plus, pe care persoana atehnica pentru care l-am luat nu le folosea... Nu incap nume lungi in agenda telefonului, nu poti schimba melodia de apel, cu ceva personal de pe card. Nu am gasit pe nicaieri cum accesezi cardul. L-am primit gratuit, de aceea il si pastrez, ca rezerva. Daca dadeam bani pe el, il trimiteam inapoi.. Bareria foarte buna, se aude destul de clar si tare, semnal bun pe ambele cartele, de ajuns pentru strictul necesar, deci pana acum isi face treaba destul de bine, de 3 luni de zile!!!.
