This is TechRadar’s review summary that gives you all the key information you need if you’re looking for quick buying advice in 30 seconds - our usual full, in-depth review follows.. The Nokia name is experiencing a resurgence in the phone market in 2017 and the latest releases to excite you include the Nokia 6 , Nokia 5 and Nokia 3.. They follow the Nokia 3310 (2017) , a ‘reboot’ of the classic feature phone that was launched earlier this year to try and drum up attention for the brand – it’s these new handsets that are the real reintroduction to the market the Nokia brand deserves.. The Nokia 3 is one of the best looking cheaper phones on the market right now. If price and the look of your phone matter most to you, the Nokia 3 may suit you well.. There's a 5-inch 720p display that offers a clear picture but can be a little dark and some may not love the picture quality it gives them when watching video or using apps.. Battery life on the Nokia 3 isn't particularly good so it can mean your phone dies off pretty quickly without you using it a lot. There's also no fingerprint sensor like there is on the Nokia 5.. The camera on the Nokia 3 is okay for a cheaper device, but it won't take phenomenal images like older devices from the brand and performance on the Nokia 3 isn't all up to scratch.. The Nokia 3 is aimed at first-time smartphone buyers, and anyone looking to spend the least amount possible on their new phone but still have access to all their apps, along with the features you’d expect to see at this price point.. If you love the design, and want a high-end looking phone without paying high-end money, you may want to go for the Nokia 3 – but you’ll also get a slightly more premium look for only a little extra cash with the Nokia 5.. Anyone who's invested in the idea of a Nokia phone, but doesn't want to indulge their nostalgia at the expense of performance and features, may also want to opt for the Nokia 5.. The Nokia 3 doesn’t have the most attractive design, but considering its price point it has a premium feel, great build quality and looks brilliant compared to some of the competition.. It’s a squared design that instantly reminds you of the design of the Windows Phone generation of Nokia devices, but instead of having a bold primary-colored plastic back it has metal edges that look superb.. The back panel is polycarbonate, but despite that it still has a premium air. The Nokia 3 comes in four color options: black, dark blue (pictured throughout this review) and two options for white; both white variants have a white back panel, with one having white edges and the other a peach-colored rim around the phone.. Scroll through to the right to see more photos of the Nokia 3 below. Screen size : 5-inch Resolution : 720x1280 Battery : 2630mAh Front camera : 8MP Rear camera : 8MP Weight : 140g Dimensions (mm) : 143.4 x 71.4 x 8.5mm OS : Android 7 CPU : MediaTek MT6773 RAM : 2GB Storage : 16GB/microSD up to 256GB. During our testing we did find the power button on the right-hand side of the phone to be a little small if you have larger fingers and thumbs. That may mean you’ll spend a little bit longer trying to hit that button and not the volume rocker, which is just above it.. On the top edge of the handset sits the 3.5mm headphone jack, which allows you to use wired headsets with the phone, while the bottom edge has a micro USB port in the centre for charging and data transfer.. The phone sits easily in the hand, but the lack of fingerprint scanner on the Nokia 3 means it takes a little longer to unlock than other phones, as you’ll need to press the power button and then use an on-screen unlock.. The Nokia 3 comes with a 5-inch display with a 720p resolution. That equals 294 pixels per inch, which is a bit below what you’d expect on a modern smartphone.. The lower resolution does mean you’re likely to spot the odd pixel compared to a Full HD resolution screen, but considering the price of this phone you shouldn’t be too disappointed with the sharpness of images.. We did find the screen to be a little dull on the Nokia 3. Brightness isn’t particularly impressive compared to other phones, so again the Moto E4, which has a bright display at the same resolution, might be a better option if that’s important to you.. The display on the Nokia 3 is the optimum size though, with the phone sitting comfortably in the hand and all areas of the screen are easy to reach no matter how small your hands are.. Battery life isn’t a highlight of the Nokia 3, and you won’t be particularly impressed by how long the phone will last on a full charge.. Alarm bells started to ring when we saw the spec list detailing a 2630mAh battery, which isn’t a particularly big cell. It doesn’t have to power too much, as there’s only a 5-inch 720p display and this isn’t an especially power-hungry phone,, but the battery generally doesn’t last that long.. With typical usage of popular apps like Spotify, messaging and social networking throughout the day we found ourselves getting to around 7pm or 8pm and being greeted by a black screen as the phone died – and the Nokia 3 often didn’t alert us when it was close to dying, which was irritating.. Battery saver mode is an option when you get low on juice, but that won’t add too much extra time to your charge.. If you're not a heavy user though, you should find the battery life to be adequate.. The Nokia 3 made it through our battery test, where we run a 90-minute video clip at full brightness and with Wi-Fi enabled, with 84% of its battery life remaining, a loss of 16%. That’s a little better than the Moto E4, which lost 18%, while the Wileyfox Swift 2 Plus lost a whole 24%.. When playing video we found the Nokia 3 to do particularly well compared to its competition, but that strong battery life isn’t reflected in real-world usage where it struggled to make it through a whole day.. There’s no fast-charging tech here, so the Nokia 3 will likely take some time to charge up. If you leave it overnight you’ll have a full battery though.. Chances are if you’re looking at the Nokia 3 you’re not looking forgoing to want a top-of-the-range camera phone – and that's just as well.. Both the rear and front cameras are 8PM units. Neither will particularly impress you though, and we found using the camera on the Nokia 3 frustrating at times.. It’s not very fast at booting up, and also takes quite some time to shoot once you’ve pressed the button, so it’s easy to miss those fleeting opportunities that can often make for great images.. In good lighting, the Nokia 3 manages to take some sharp images, and for an 8MP sensor that’s missing many of the bells and whistles of most modern smartphones it could be a lot worse.. There’s a powerful LED flash for darker shots, which you’ll probably need as the low-light image quality from this phone isn’t very good.. Top-end features such as HDR, 4K video recording or optical image stabilization are nowhere to be seen, so don’t buy this phone if you’re looking for a great camera.. We found video footage to be fairly stable considering the lack of any stabilization tech, but you can only record in low-resolution 720p.. The front camera is a similar affair, but an 8MP lens isn’t as bad if you just plan to take the odd image of your face or use it for video calling sometimes.. The Nokia 3 is running the latest Android 7 software right out of the box, and it’s the stock version, so it looks and behaves exactly as Google intends it to. That means there’s no Nokia branding on top, and the phone doesn’t come packed to the brim with Nokia or third-party apps that HMD has decided to put in.. You’ll get all of the new features of Android 7 here, including split-screen mode and the newly designed quick settings pull-down menu, plus it looks great. It's also now confirmed that the Nokia 3 will be eventually upgraded to Android Oreo , but we don't know when that'll happen.. Stock Android also allows you to swipe up from the bottom of the homescreen to open up the app drawer and it’s a much smoother experience than on other Android phones where it takes a while to load the app drawer after a tap.. However, performance on the Nokia 3 isn’t fantastic, and you may find yourself getting frustrated with this phone at some points, especially if you’ve used a more expensive phone in the past.. The Nokia 3 boasts a MediaTek MT6737 system-on-a-chip, which is a chip we haven’t seen running on many devices released in the West, with 2GB of RAM to back it up.. On multiple occasions during our time with the Nokia 3 we found apps would take a frustrating amount of time to load, and we experienced some crashes as well.. This was especially noticeable when we were using Android Pay with the NFC sensor on the back of the phone. We regularly found ourselves waiting much longer than we’d expect to with other phones, and in a time-pressured environment, with fellow shoppers shuffling their feet and muttering behind us, it became quite frustrating.. Even undemanding apps such as Twitter or Spotify were regular culprits when it came to crashing – and there’s nothing more. annoying than when you want to complete simple tasks but your phone won’t allow you to.. Benchmarking-wise, we ran the Geekbench 4 software on the Nokia 3 and it turned in a disappointing score of 1,464.. The Moto G5, by way of contrast, managed 2,377, while the Wileyfox Swift 2 Plus – a UK-exclusive phone that costs about the same as the Nokia 3 – achieved a score of 2,073.. In conclusion, the Nokia 3 will struggle to load many big-name apps, although all of them will work eventually – you may just have to wait a little while longer than you’d like to.. We found watching films and video on the Nokia 3 an enjoyable experience despite the small and not particularly high-resolution screen.. There’s okay audio through the headphone jack, but sometimes the phone would struggle to maintain the Bluetooth connection – we found we couldn’t move very far from the phone before it would start to cut out, and sometimes it would even struggle in a pocket while walking.. The speakers on the Nokia 3 are not impressive either – there’s only one speaker, which you can easily cover with your hand when holding the phone.. We also found listening to music and other audio on the Nokia 3 to be an okay experience, although the sometimes-temperamental Bluetooth connection may cause you the odd issue. If you only plan to use wired headsets, though, you shouldn’t be concerned.. If you’re a fan of listening to the radio on your phone you’ll be glad to find an FM radio app on the Nokia 3 – you’ll need to have a wired headset attached for this to work as it acts as an aerial.. When using the (flimsy and cheap) pair of headphones included in the box with the Nokia 3 we found the FM connection worked well. When you first boot the app up you’ll be able to scan for all the available channels, and switching between these proves easy to do.. It’s probably not a key feature that will encourage you to buy the Nokia 3, but it’s a good alternative service to entertain yourself, especially if you have a limited internet allowance so don’t want to use a internet based radio app on your phone.. Gaming on the Nokia 3 was a surprisingly relaxing experience. Loading times can be a little extended compared to more expensive phones, but most modern games ran smoothly.. We tried out Real Racing 3 and Monument Valley, which ran well on the phone despite the sub-par processor setup for most everyday tasks. Don’t buy this handset if you’re looking for your games to load immediately and play at the optimum level though.. If the Nokia 3 isn’t for you, then we’ve picked three excellent choices for you to consider instead.. Motorola’s mid-range wonder will cost you a little bit more than the Nokia 3, but overall it’s a more attractive and well-built package. We loved the part-metal design, which is similar to the look of the Nokia 3, as well as its crisp Full HD display.. You’ll also get a fingerprint scanner for your extra money, which is something the Nokia 3 is lacking. For only £30 or $40 more, the Moto G5 offers a lot more features.. The Nokia 5 costs a touch more than the Nokia 3 too, but it comes with a few extra features that you may think are worth paying for.. There’s a slightly more premium build quality, a lot more power under the hood, and a fingerprint scanner below the screen.. The Nokia 5 still has a few issues of its own, including just 16GB of storage and a 720p display rather than Full HD, but overall it’s a better option than its cheaper sibling.. If you’re looking for a phone for around the same price as the Nokia 3 (if you’re living in the UK), you’ll want to take a look at the Moto E4. You may even be able to get it for a little less money, and again you’ll get a fingerprint scanner.. You’ll enjoy good build quality, as well as Android 7 software and a swappable battery, making the E4 a compelling alternative to the Nokia 3 for your next phone..

The Nokia 3 is the first attempt by HMD Global – the brand that owns the Nokia name – to create a budget smartphone.. It’s a wannabe Moto G5 rival, but one that doesn’t quite offer as much as our favourite budget phone of 2017.. The Nokia 3 is reminiscent of older Windows Phone-toting Nokia phones. It’s a blocky rectangle, with a matte plastic back that feels like it should pop off and a metal rim. The slightly rounded corners and sides make the device easy to grip, and in typical Nokia fashion, the phone feels like it could survive being run over by a tank.. It’s a serviceable design, but it feels a little dull. I’ve been a fan of Nokia’s approach to higher-end devices, but not so much its budget approach. The capacitive buttons below the display lack any form of backlight, which makes the device difficult to use in the dark. In general, it feels like HMD has adopted the Nokia look but without making any improvements to it.. The Nokia 3 is small and can be comfortably used in one hand. This is becoming increasingly rare, and it’s quite nice to go back to a phone with a 5-inch display. The device itself is similar in size to an iPhone 6/6S/7, and the latest Moto G. It feels lighter than those phones, though, which is likely a result of the plentiful use of plastic in the construction.. The display on the Nokia 3 is a 5-inch panel, with a 720p resolution and a Gorilla Glass coating. It isn’t great, even for the price – and, again, Nokia isn’t really doing anything here that hasn’t been done before.. Resolution isn’t really the issue, however, and even though the display isn’t the most pixel-dense panel, it still produces sharp pictures and text. The problem is the way it reproduces colours. To get a sense of this you need only open the app drawer, where the lack of colour is present in the icons. Open the Play Store and the green surround is completely off.. Look past the colour issues, and there are some more positive aspects of the display. Brightness isn’t an issue and viewing angles are surprisingly good, which can’t be said for some of the competition.. Performance makes or breaks a budget phone, and with the Nokia 3 it just about breaks it. Too many corners have been cut here, and even though the price is low, the lag you’ll constantly encounter will make you feel that you’ve paid too much.. The culprit is the measly MediaTek 6737 CPU, which is probably the most under-powered processor you can currently find inside a phone. Basic tasks such as opening up a website in Chrome or downloading an attachment in Gmail are a drawn-out process; I’ve even experienced problems importing a picture into Instagram. More intensive apps crash constantly, and classic system-hogs such as Facebook will likely need to be reinstalled frequently to keep them fresh..

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. I got used to the chugging pace of the phone after a few days, with things beginning to feel normal – but after a few minutes with the Moto G5, I realised just how plodding the Nokia 3 can be.. The included 2GB of RAM is the absolute minimum needed on an Android phone, and you’ll certainly notice apps dropping from memory and they’ll require reloading very quickly. 16GB storage is slightly more acceptable, and there’s a microSD slot for beefing that out of a little.. Predictably, it’s a similar story when it comes to gaming, with long load times, constantly dropped frames and plenty of frustration. Basic games such as Candy Crush do work, but I wouldn’t bother with anything more demanding than that. I tried playing Injustice 2, and it crashed constantly; once I did get into a game, it was unplayable.. I’m less fussed about the gaming performance; after all, you should know what you’re getting with a super-cheap phone – but I don’t think the Nokia 3 is cheap enough to warrant the day-to-day sluggishness.. Real-world performance was borne out in the Geekbench 4 benchmark tests, which crashed constantly.. The speaker is terrible, too – again, hardly surprising; call quality and 4G connectivity is fine, however. GPS proved wildly innacurate, often pinning my location a few streets away in Google Maps. It’s these little things that soon become tiring, and it’s hard to forgive in even a budget phone.. Next Camera, battery life, software and verdict. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

CNET también está disponible en español.. The Nokia 3 is cheap and you'll know it. The Good The Android-based Nokia 3 is dirt-cheap, looks good and is comfortable to hold in one hand.. The Bad Its lack of power makes using the phone sluggish and frustrating.. The Bottom Line The Nokia 3 sacrifices too much processing power to achieve its low price. You’re better off spending a bit more on the Motorola Moto G5.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. The Nokia 3 is the lowest-end of Nokia's new line of Android phones. It's on sale in the UK for £120, but you will have to make sacrifices for that price. That converts to $156 or AU$200, although Nokia has no plans to bring the phone to the US.. The biggest problems are in the processor performance. The quad-core chip struggles to run even the stock version of Android Nougat, making swiping around the interface sluggish and stuttery. There's a noticeable delay when opening apps, too, and some apps -- including the Google Play store -- forced quit on several occasions. The design of the phone is lovely, though, with a slim body and narrow bezel, making it compact enough to hold in one hand. The 5-inch display's 720p resolution is sufficient to clearly showcase the essentials, although it's neither bright nor bold, so don't buy this phone hoping to show off your holiday snaps at their best.. Speaking of snaps, the 8-megapixel camera is fine for some quick photos in the park on a bright day, but it lacks the vibrant colours or exposure balance of pricier camera phones. The HDR mode does a decent job of lightening up some of the shadows, but even then you won't get results you'll want to do more with than simply slap on Facebook. It's very grainy in low-light, although the 8-megapixel front-facing camera takes some crisp selfies.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

The Nokia 3 comes with a 5-inch 720p screen, 1.3 GHz quad-core processor, 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of storage (expandable via microSD) and two 8 megapixel cameras.. Nokia 3 Review Nokia 3 manual Nokia 3 benchmarks. Dimensions: 5.65 x 2.81 x 0.33 inches (143.4 x 71.4 x 8.48 mm). Materials: Main body: Plastic; Accents: Aluminum. Display Physical size: 5.0 inches. Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor, Polarizing filter. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR). Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Quad-core, 1300 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz.

Features: Mass storage device, USB Host, USB charging. Other: NFC, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 26 Feb 2017. Shopping information Accessories: Charger, Data cable, Headset, Quick guide, SIM Door key. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

The entry-level Nokia 3 is based on the Android operating system, and it resembles the Nokia’s design philosophy with a refreshed view.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. by Victor Hristov. Nokia - Nokia + Android - Android +. 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction Nokia is back in town. A new company, HMD Global, has taken ownership of the popular brand and has big plans for the future, including a flagship phone with top specs. But even before that anticipated flagship, the new Nokia is back with a few affordable phones and we have its cheapest Android smartphone up for review: the Nokia 3. Why is this phone different than all the other cheap phones out there? For starters, Nokia commits to a clean, clutter-free Android user experience, and that’s important. The Nokia 3 runs on Android 7.0 Nougat, it features a sleek, recognizable design, 4G LTE connectivity and is priced to sell. But then, it also takes a few shortcuts that are hard to forgive, even on a dirt cheap phone: there is no fingerprint scanner, for instance. We look at the Nokia 3 in detail to find out whether this new cheap Android phone can make a difference in a crowded space. In the box: Phone Wall charger (5V, 1A) microUSB Cable Earbuds SIM ejector tool User manual Design It’s a looker. If you had handed us a Nokia 3 a couple of years ago and never turned the screen on, we would have said that it looks just like another Nokia Windows Phone. It definitely carries that legacy look. That’s not a bad thing at all: quite the contrary, it lacks the rounded corners of most modern phones, and is instead much more rectangular. The frame is made out of metal and feels premium, while the back cover is plastic, but it blends well with the frame and looks good. As an added bonus, it does not get smudged with fingerprints easily. The Nokia 3 is 0.33-inch (8.5mm) thick, but feels thinner and sleeker because of its rounded sides. Up front, you have the Nokia logo discreetly located in the upper right corner, while in the bottom part are the three Android navigation capacitive keys. What’s missing is a backlight for those keys, plus there is no LED notification light. The most notable missing feature, though, is a fingerprint scanner. It feels weird having a phone without a proper fingerprint reader in 2017, a feature that by now is available on many other cheap Android phones. On the very bottom, you have a microUSB port for charging the Nokia 3. No USB-C here, but most other phones in this price range don’t have it either. Finally, the Nokia 3 is also a dual SIM phone that also supports microSD cards. You have a two-slot tray for the SIM cards, and a separate one for microSD cards, all on the left side of the phone. This phone is not water-protected in any special way, so keep that in mind. Display I'm blue da ba dee da ba daa. There is a 5-inch HD (720 x 1280 pixel) IPS LCD display on the Nokia 3. The first thing you notice in the specs table is the low resolution, but that’s not our biggest gripe with this screen. The low resolution is noticeable: there is a slight pixelization, especially noticeable when you look at text, but what’s worse is that colors on the screen look very skewed and inaccurate. White appears very bluish, and colors are just all over the place, not balanced at all. This is one of the worst displays in terms of color reproduction that we have seen in a long while. There are a few good things about it, though: 10-point multi-touch and proper oleophobic coating are two features that are well executed here and - believe it or not - are not standard on affordable phones just yet. The screen gets bright, reaching peak brightness of 485 nits, but it is terribly reflective, which makes it harder to use outdoors. Software features like a blue light filter are not present (there are third party apps for that, though), and the minimum brightness goes only down to 20 nits, which is still way too bright for our eyes at night.. 5.65 x 2.81 x 0.33 inches. 143.4 x 71.4 x 8.48 mm. 5.91 x 2.91 x 0.38 inches. 150.2 x 74 x 9.7 mm. 5.33 x 2.61 x 0.31 inches. 135.4 x 66.2 x 7.9 mm. 5.74 x 2.85 x 0.32 inches. 145.8 x 72.3 x 8.1 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software..

What should you ask for that price?. (Posts: 60; Member since: 11 Oct 2016). posted on 24 Jul 2017, 05:47. And else shd be expect from iphonearena and Victor. (Posts: 907; Member since: 27 May 2011). posted on 24 Jul 2017, 07:40. We took a look at European unit that costs around €140 (and in many markets €160). Where have you seen an $80 price for this phone? Give us a specific link, but without a link, it's hard to believe what you say. And yes, for €140, we expect more: phones like the Moto G4 / G4 Plus, Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime prove it's possible to have more in an affordable phone..

Price of moto g4 is 190 fyi. what more can you expect from a 150EUR phone?. clean android interface but sluggish performance. dude get real! Even the s7 lags when you use maps and watch youtube.!. speaking of xiaomi there has been constant reports of phone catching fire all the damn time (Dont ask me for the link. How do you guys fail to see the yellow tint on the Iphone7 but see a blue tint on the nokia? isheep!. If 16gb isn't enough you have a expansion slot. How can you mention this as a con if its expandable?. You wont find a better 149EUR phone with price as cheap as that,better build quality, with 8mp cams on front and back, and Android 7 out of the box. (Posts: 334; Member since: 29 Mar 2017). posted on 24 Jul 2017, 06:12. That's to be expected from a low-end flagship. I dont get why people get upset when a clearly poor product gets a lower score than an iPhone.. (Posts: 2; Member since: 24 Jul 2017). posted on 24 Jul 2017, 06:30.

(Posts: 739; Member since: 17 Jan 2014). posted on 24 Jul 2017, 14:36. I have to admit its a little disappointing, but being in the US probably means this will never even be an option for me. I would much rather have the Moto E4, which is becoming available in the US through multiple offerings, and is tending to cost a lot less. I think I will remove the Nokia 3 from my "wanted phones" list.. (Posts: 124; Member since: 09 Mar 2017). posted on 25 Jul 2017, 00:59. It would be lot better if nokia would choosen with. NOKIA 3 with SD 425 16GB 2GB Price 5999. Nokia 5 with SD435 32GB 3GB price 8999. Nokia 6 with SD626 64GB 4GB price 12999. (Posts: 1; Member since: 17 Sep 2017). posted on 17 Sep 2017, 13:15. I think this assessment is not fair. I own nokia 3 and found it pretty good. Its price is around 110 euros when it comes out. You require a fingerprint sensor for the 110 euro phone :)? You should compare it with higher priced phones such as samsung A3 or Moto G5 (110 euro vs 180 euro so funny) :)). Want to comment? Please login or register ..

Nokia 6, Nokia 5, and Nokia 3: Our first take. HMD's Nokia 6 smartphone is now available for purchase at Best Buy. Promise of monthly security updates, timely version updates. Design can be a little plain. HMD Global , the company licensing Nokia’s name , unveiled two. new smartphones, as well as a feature phone to drum up the nostalgia factor for the iconic brand.. The Nokia 6, which first launched in China last year, will be available globally. It will be followed by two lower-performing and smaller devices — the Nokia 5 and the Nokia 3. HMD said it’s committed to keeping up with the monthly security updates from Google for. the operating system, as well as being timely with new Android version updates.. Speaking of Android, all of these devices will have the Google Assistant now that Google is bringing its artificially intelligent bot to all Android phones running Android 6.0 or higher.. All in all, the entire lineup seemed to be the best-built budget phones we’ve seen. The Nokia 6 debuted last year in China, but it will finally be available globally. If you need a refresher on the specs, the. 5.5-inch device is the only one of the trio to feature a Full HD display. immersive sound comes via dual speakers and a dedicated amplifier with Dolby Atmos certification.. The extra metal protection along the sides of the phone make it feel very. durable, and the Nokia 6 truly does feel like a high-end phone, both in terms of hardware and software.. Running Android 7.1.1 Nougat , the Nokia 6 is powered by the same processor in the Nokia 5 — the Snapdragon 430 — but it has an extra gigabyte of RAM. It also has more storage — 32GB to be exact, and MicroSD card support. It also carries the same 3,000mAh battery. primary 16 megapixel camera with dual-tone flash, along with an 8 megapixel front-facing camera.. There are five colors to choose from, but the the glossy. Arte Black was specially made for the phone’s global release. It’s quite the fingerprint magnet, though. colors are black, blue, silver, and copper.. In the United States, the Nokia 6 will cost you $229. variant is available through Best Buy , Amazon , AT&T, and T-Mobile-compatible matte black and silver.. Overseas, it’ll start at 229 euros ($242), but if you want the. Arte Black special edition, you’ll have to shell out 299 euros, or $316.. The sequence of names really don’t make much sense, but it’s not hard to figure out that the Nokia 5 is the middle child of the group. The 2.5d glass on the 5.2-inch display offers a 720-pixel resolution, and it feels durable thanks to its aluminum unibody. The screen offers extra visibility in direct sunlight thanks to a polarizer.. The power button and volume rocker sits on the top right, and the bottom-front features capacitive navigation buttons. The middle button, however, doubles as a fingerprint sensor. The aluminum unibody really helps make this phone feel like a premium device — and you’ll certainly be surprised that it costs. 189 euros (or about $200 U.S.).. is Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 430 with 2GB RAM, which seemed to keep the phone running smoothly in our brief time with it. What likely helps is how the Nokia 5 runs stock Android 7.1.1 Nougat, but don’t expect to do any. intensive multitasking or play graphics-heavy games.. It sadly only comes with 16GB of internal storage, which is much lower than the standard offerings from phones in this price range. Thankfully, there’s a MicroSD card slot that supports up to 128GB of extra storage. It surprisingly has a massive 3,000mAH battery, which should keep this low-resolution device chugging along for quite a while.. There’s only a single speaker (but thankfully a headphone jack), and at the bottom sits a MicroUSB charging port. It’s unclear why Nokia went with MicroUSB over USB Type-C, which a lot of other budget phones have adopted. At least there’s an NFC sensor, meaning you can use Android Pay.. The rear camera packs 13 megapixels, and the front has 8 megapixels and. There didn’t seem to be much shutter lag, but we’ll have to explore the camera more when we get a review unit.. You can choose from blue, copper, black, and silver for the. The Nokia 3 is the most affordable of the lineup. the 5-inch screen from accidental drops, but the back is made of polycarbonate. What’s remarkable is how Nokia makes this phone feel like it’s made of metal, as there’s a nice weight to it.. Like the others in the series, the Nokia 3 follows a minimalist design. The back is plain, save the camera; the buttons are on the right, and you’ll find capacitive navigation buttons on the front.. Like the Nokia 5, the device only has a 720-pixel resolution. It has a MediaTek 6737 processor with 2GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage that again can be expanded up to 128GB by using. It has a slightly smaller 2,650mAh battery, which charges via the MicroUSB port on the bottom. 8 megapixels, though the primary one has an LED flash.. runs Android 7.0 Nougat, and it’s likely to get upgraded to 7.1.1, as the company said it would be committed to timely version updates from Google. There are white, black, blue, and silver color options, and the phone will only cost 139 euros, or about $147.. All three devices seemed to perform well, but what’s unique is their build quality. seems to have gone extra lengths to make sure. The devices also seem to have big batteries — when paired with low-end specs, that usually means you’ll see great battery life. We’ll have to dig deep when we get our review units.. All three phones have launched in India, and are expected to. launch in other countries in the near future, though we don’t yet know where. The Nokia 3 is available in India for. 9,499 rupees, or $148, while the Nokia 5 is available for 12,899 rupees, or $200, and the Nokia 6 for 14,999 rupees, or $233..

Ketan Pratap , 28 July 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Nokia 3 is priced at Rs. It is only available at offline stores. Gadgets 360 rates the phone 6 out of 10. Nokia 3 design Nokia 3 specifications and software Nokia 3 performance and camera Nokia 3 battery life. The Nokia 3, the most affordable of the three new Nokia-branded Android smartphones, was launched in India last month. It is the first smartphone with the Nokia name to hit the Indian market in a long time, but it's worth pointing out that it hasn't been manufactured by Nokia itself. The company that once dominated global smartphone sales is getting a second shot at the mobile business thanks to a brand licensing agreement with HMD Global , a Helsinki-based company run largely by former Nokia and Microsoft employees. announced last year, HMD Global has an exclusive global license to create and sell Nokia-branded phones for 10 years. The company has been betting heavily on the Nokia brand's power, and fans have been looking forward to the devices which are now finally here.. The rebooted Nokia 3310 was the first to be made available in India and received mixed response. The other two Android smartphones are the Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 , which are yet to be made available in India. These four Nokia phones were the biggest announcements at MWC 2017 , but it will only translate into sales if the products are good enough.. HMD Global has been marketing the Nokia 3 to buyers looking for a good design and "pure Android with regular updates" at a budget price. The Nokia 3 has been priced aggressively to take on the some of the heavyweights in the Indian market. However, it will have a tough fight ahead of it, as HMD Global needs to find its place in the Indian market and compete with popular phones like the Xiaomi Redmi 4 , Moto G5 , and Yu Yureka Black. The Nokia 3 is being marketed as the "Android phone with all the smartphone essentials" but will that be enough? We take a look.. The Nokia 3 arrived at our lab in a playful white retail box which reminded us of the old Nokia days. The phone has a resemblance to the Lumia range of Windows Mobile-powered phones, but. only in terms of design as the Nokia 3 runs Android. If you are in the market or searching for a phone online, you will see options priced under Rs. 10,000 with all-metal unibodies and they look more or less similar - whether it's the Yu Yureka Black or the Xiaomi Redmi 4. In our opinion, the Nokia 3 brings freshness to the budget segment. While the Nokia 3 doesn't have an all-metal body, the quality of polycarbonate used for the back and its metal frame still make the design good overall. The feel of the phone in a hand is one of the best we have experienced in this segment. Throughout our review period, we used the Nokia 3 with just one hand without being afraid of dropping it. The squarish shape of the phone offers a great grip from all angles. Our review unit was a Matte Black version of the Nokia 3, and it is also available in Silver White. The power and volume buttons are on the right and were painted black to match the phone's body.. On the left, you'll find the dedicated slots for two SIM cards and a microSD card, which is good to see as many other manufacturers offer hybrid slots at this price point. The bottom has the standard charging port plus a speaker grille, while the top has the 3.5mm audio jack. If you look closely, antenna bands are visible on the top and bottom of the Nokia 3, but they blend in with the colour of the phone. There are Nokia logos on the front as well back, just like older Nokia devices.. Typing on this phone was easy enough, and at 8.48mm thick, it's actually thinner than the Redmi 4, but the latter has a much bigger battery. During the review period, we found that the power and volume rocker buttons were placed slightly too high and we had to stretch to reach them while using the phone with one hand. We also missed a fingerprint scanner, which has become almost a standard feature on smartphones, even at this price level. We feel that this is a significant omission for the Nokia 3. The capacitive Android navigation buttons are not backlit which means you could have a hard time finding them in the dark.. Inside the Nokia 3 retail box, you will get a quick start guide, earphones, a charger, USB cable, and a SIM ejector tool apart from the phone itself.. The Nokia 3 features a 5-inch IPS LCD screen with a resolution of 720x1280 pixels and 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass. The phone is powered by a 1.3GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6737 SoC coupled with 2GB of RAM. It has 16GB of storage which can be expanded using a microSD card (up to 128GB). There are 8-megapixel cameras at the front and back. The rear camera features an f/2.0 aperture, autofocus, and an LED flash. The front camera, on the other hand, also has autofocus and an 84-degree field of view. The phone packs a non-removable 2630mAh battery. 4G and VoLTE (voice over LTE) are supported, and connectivity options include USB-OTG, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.. The Nokia 3 is among few smartphones in the budget category to offer stock Android Nougat. It offers all the bells and whistles one can expect from a stock Android device such as bundled notifications where users get group notifications from a single app instead of multiple ones; the ability to reply to messages from the notification pop-up; notification management, which allows users to disable or silence notifications from individual apps; quick app switching with just a double-tap on the Overview button, and an all-new Settings app. Split-screen multitasking, which allows you to use two apps simultaneously, is also supported. The Nokia 3 supports Google Assistant out-of-the-box, which is yet to arrive on many other phones in the same price segment.. Apart from monthly security updates, HMD Global has also promised that the Nokia 3 (as well as the Nokia 5 and Nokia 6) will receive Android O when it's available.. The Nokia 3 fares well in day-to-day usage. Despite using it for GPS navigation and long gaming sessions, the phone didn't get warm, which is another advantage of the polycarbonate back.. However, we felt could feel the phone slowing down a bit while multitasking and we experienced some lags when switching from one app to another when there were over 12 apps open in the background. The phone was able to handle light games with ease, but graphics-heavy ones like Need for Speed: No Limits did slow down, which was annoying. The phone was able to play a range of video and audio files without any hiccups.. The single loudspeaker works well enough in a small room, and its clarity is decent. The bundled earphones are also good enough. We like to point out that the Nokia 3 is one of only a few phones that actually has bundled earphones in the box.. The 5-inch display on the Nokia 3 has excellent colour reproduction and brightness. We liked watching videos on the Nokia 3 and felt that this is among the better screens we've seen in the budget segment in terms of sunlight legibility and viewing angles. It's worth pointing out, however, that phones such as the Yu Yureka Black offer full-HD screens at prices lower than the Nokia 3.. The Nokia 3 didn't really impress us with its benchmark results. It managed only 27,432 in AnTuTu, 15,020 overall in Quadrant, and 10fps in GFXBench. The Xiaomi Redmi 4 ( Review ) and Yu Yureka Black ( Review ) gave better results in the same tests.. The 8-megapixel rear camera does okay in good lighting conditions, and autofocusing is quick as well. The samples we took in good light turned out to have decent levels of detail and controlled noise in the corners when zoomed in. However, we found that darker parts of the samples did lose details while large areas were often overexposed. At times, there were slight white balance inaccuracies in images as well. The Nokia 3 has an HDR mode though we noticed that it didn't always kick in when required, and we felt that it could have helped in several cases. Unfortunately, low-light shots came out badly. Autofocus locking was slow, and the samples we took lacked detail while there was a lot of noise all over.. Tap to see full-sized Nokia 3 camera samples. The Nokia 3 supports 1080p video recording, and the quality is decent. The front camera on the phone also disappointed us, as despite its autofocus capability photos still came out blurry. You can use the Nokia 3 for a quick video call or casual selfies, but don't expect a lot in terms of quality.. However, we liked the camera app which had a very easy-to-use interface with all major functions accessible in one tap. In beautify mode, the phone tries to improve photos by applying some corrections, but this isn't always effective.. The battery in the Nokia 3 lasted for roughly 16-18 hours of heavy usage which wasn't a surprise, considering its 2630mAh capacity. We used the phone for roughly a week. and we can say that it gave us better battery life when our usage was less demanding. Our HD video loop test lasted for 10 hours and 25 minutes which is good for a phone of this size. There's no support for fast charging, and it took roughly two hours to get up to 100 percent which is longer than other phones with bigger batteries usually take.. Nokia 3 Android phone in pictures. Verdict The Nokia 3 is now available in India priced at Rs. It is a good-looking smartphone, and also supports 4G with VoLTE. One big positive point is that the company has promised future Android updates. Overall performance and camera results aren't its biggest highlights. We also missed a fingerprint scanner, which really should be a standard feature now.. In our opinion, the Nokia 3 is best suited for first-time smartphone buyers and those looking for some experience with Android in general - if you can get this offline-only phone at a store near you. At this price, you could also go for the Xiaomi Redmi 4 or the Yu Yureka Black, both of which offer better all-around performance. The Asus ZenFone Live is another contender in the same price bracket.. For the latest smartphone launches by Samsung, Nokia, Sony, Asus, and other MWC 2018 announcements, visit our MWC hub ..

Esto también se puede leer en español.. Nokia 3 and 5 bring up the middle of its new Android phone lineup. The two phones come with plain Android Nougat software in classy casings.. by February 26, 2017 8:31 AM PST. Nokia 3 and 5 bring Nokia design know-how to midrange Android. Nokia 3 and 5 knock out pure Android. Nokia 5 specs 5.2-inch 720p screen LTE Cat 4 Android 7.1.1 Nougat software Qualcomm Snapdragon octa-core processor 2GB RAM 16GB internal storage 13-megapixel rear camera 8-megapixel front-facing camera 3,000mAh battery Nokia 3 specs 5-inch screen LTE Cat 4 Android 7.0 Nougat 1.3Ghz Quad-core processor 2GB RAM 16GB internal storage Polycarbonate back 8-megapixel front and rear-facing cameras 2,650mAh battery. Nokia is back in the game and expanding its range.. The legendary Finnish company probably made your first phone , but its dominance came to an abrupt end in 2014 when it sold its entire phone business to Microsoft. Fortunately for fans, a bunch of former Nokia employees have formed a company called HMD Global to make Nokia phones anew. They began with the Nokia 6 , which is now joined by the mid-range Nokia 3 and Nokia 5.. The Nokia 5 is a 5.2-inch mid-range model with an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor. The 3 is a 5-inch phone with a quad-core chip.. Both phones are loaded with pure Android -- and nothing else. Nokia has added no extra bloatware to the Android Nougat firmware, which means the company can promise they stay "pure, secure and up to date". Nokia says it will also provide monthly security updates so your phone stays healthy.. Nokia 3 and 5 bring Nokia design know-how to midrange Android. The new phones are set to be released in spring this year, with exact dates (and specs) depending on countries. For example, some markets will get dual-SIM models while others will just have a single SIM card slot. HMD says they'll be on sale in more than 120 countries from 500 partners, including mobile carriers as well as retailers. You can register your interest in the new devices starting today.. The phones come in four colour schemes: black, silver, copper and white or a shade of midnight blue familiar to Nokia fans from classics like the 3310.. They're designed with the Scandinavian philosophy of "less is more" in mind, according to HMD. The 5 is carved from a block of aluminium, while the cheaper 3 has a metal frame and polycarbonate plastic back. They're both slickly-designed devices with a touch of class you don't get from other upstart phone manufacturers -- the old Nokia know-how seems to have been carried over to these new devices.. HMD says it's focused on displays and cameras that give you a good real-world experience rather than chasing high specs. That means respectable prices: the 3 is around €139, which directly converted is roughly £120, $147 or AU$190. The 5 is a respectable €189, which works out to around £160, $200 or AU$260.. The new devices were announced in Barcelona today at mobile extravaganza Mobile World Congress , alongside a special edition Nokia 6 ( $229.00 at Amazon.com ) and a rebooted version of the iconic 3310.

Redesigned and rebranded for the 2017 market, Nokia is back, once again, with affordable and simple smartphones, now manufactured by HMD Global.. Nokia 3 has been built with simplicity in mind, yet it's also a modern and capable handset. The polycarbonate shell and Mediatek chipset help to keep costs down, delivering an affordable, yet still high-performing device. Stock Android 7.0 Nougat is also installed with a guarantee of regular security updates and patches.. The Nokia 3, from Clove Technology, will be provided SIM Free and ready to work on all compatible UK and European networks.. The phone uses a NANO SIM card. For LTE compatibility outside of Europe, please check the specifications with your local operator.. The Nokia 3 is being manufactured in Matte Black, Silver, Copper and Tempered Blue with 2GB of RAM and 16GB Storage.. Availability of all options will depend on global sales region.. In a world full of large, expensive smartphones, it can often be difficult to work out if more affordable options are any good.. With feature phones this never used to be the case; all phones were good at the basics - you mostly bought on style or one additional feature.. Nokia wants to get back to those ideals and the Nokia 3 is the perfect example. The phone is basic and affordable, yet manages to do everything you would expect from a modern device.. With Android 7.0 installed on the Nokia 3, you know the system is up to date and capable of running the most recent apps and media.. A 5-inch high definition IPS display provides a full range of colours with an excellent contrast ratio. At this size, the phone remains pocketable whilst also serving up ample space for reading messages, browsing the web and playing games.. Nokia's classic coloured polycarbonate shells are durable and solid, holding up to regular use and no stranger to being dropped into bags or pockets with keys and other objects.. The surrounding aluminium frame provides an extra level of sturdiness to the finished design and evokes an air of professionalism to the otherwise entry tier smartphone.. Keeping the LCD panel safe is scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass. This has been sculpted with a 2.5D curve specifically to the Nokia 3's dimensions; an extra manufacturing step that shows attention to detail.. Choosing an affordable phone shouldn't mean losing out on a decent camera.. The 8 MP module on the Nokia 3 may not have the high resolution of larger, more expensive devices, yet it still allows you to take lovely pictures thanks to fast autofocus and LED flash, alongside a f/2.0 lens aperture and 1.12-micron pixels.. Flip the phone over and, on the front, you'll find an impressive 8 MP selfie shooter with the same lens specification and an 84-degree field of view to get a whole group into the shot!. Nokia is ensuring that the latest Android is available for the Nokia 3. Shipping with version 7.0, the system will be stock without any additional software or apps outside of Google's recommended suite.. Nokia has also stated they will provide regular updates which will keep you safe and secure.. Stock Android 7.0 has a number of new features, the full list can be found HERE .. A total of 1500 emoji is now available in Android 7 with several new icons being provided through updates.. Nougat also allows you to have more than one standard language saved to the keyboard. This lets you quickly switch between languages and dictionaries from the keyboard, without having to go deep into the settings.. Running two apps side by side is now built directly into Android. This is also useful for switching between apps. For instance, you could have YouTube running in one window whilst browsing through a relevant news article.. Google have updated the Vulkan API within Android 7 so developers can take advantage of new 3D techniques when creating games and other interactive experiences.. Virtual Reality is now built directly into Android 7 thanks to Android Daydream .. Pick up a Daydream ready headset and download VR content from the Play store to experience a new dimension of entertainment.. Android's Doze system will intelligently put background applications into a low power mode. Apps that require background processes will be left to operate normally, so you don't have to worry about closing down all your apps to improve performance.. Doze has also been updated for Android 7. If the screen is off and the phone notices movement such as you walking with it in your pocket, it will automatically switch to a low-power mode until lifted.. Notifications have been overhauled in Android 7. Groups of notifications from a single app (such as multiple conversations from a messaging app) are bundled into one icon. This can be tapped on and expanded for more detail.. You can also act directly from the notification shade. If you only need to make a quick reply, you can type directly into a mini conversation on the notification shade rather than having to fully open the relevant app.. The quick settings menu can also be rearranged to better suit your personal use of the phone.. New Android features include seamless updates. System updates will download in the background in a separate partition and are checked prior to installation. Background download lets you choose when to make the final installation, rather than being interrupted.. Find out more about Android security HERE .. Resolution 720 x 1280 (~294 ppi).

Nokia is back with a new budget Android smartphone, the Nokia 3, which is finally on sale in the UK. Find out what we thought in our Nokia 3 review. Is Nokia's new Android phone a bit too budget?. Mediatek MT6737 with quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53 CPU. Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices. Nokia is back, and with it comes new Android phones. HMD Global, a Finnish startup, is using the Nokia brand to bring the new phones to the market, as well as a reboot of the famous and much-loved Nokia 3310 .. Here, we take a closer look at the Nokia 3, the cheapest in the new range. You can also find out more about its bigger siblings in our Nokia 5 review and Nokia 6 review , as well at the latest Nokia 8 and 9 rumours .. The Nokia 3 is the cheapest phone in the new Nokia Android range, with a price of £129.99.. That means we can place the Nokia 3 firmly in the budget smartphone category, where it's up against the likes of the Moto G5 and the Wileyfox Swift 2 Plus , though it's cheaper than both of those.. The good news is, it's pretty widely available. You can pick it up SIM-free from Amazon , John Lewis , or Carphone Warehouse , or you can pick it up on contract from just £12.99 per month - with nothing upfront - from Carphone Warehouse.. The Nokia 3 has a 5in, 1280x720. Gorilla Glass screen housed in a compact polycarbonate body, with a rounded aluminium frame that looks impressively. premium considering its price tag, and a soft-touch finish to the back of the body.. Obviously that resolution is a little lower than you might hope for these days, but once you factor in the smaller form factor it still delivers 294 pixels per inch, and the visuals are still crisp and bright - this display is only likely to disappoint if you were hoping for a phone to watch movies on.. prefer the 5in screen size to some of the bigger screens in flagship phones, because it means you can fit the phone comfortably in the palm of your hand. At 143.4x71.4x8.5mm and 143g, most people should. find they can use the Nokia 3 one-handed without running into any problems.. The Nokia 3 is available in Tempered Blue, Silver, Matte Black or Copper, and is 8.48mm thick. There is a very, very slight camera bump, but we love how symmetrical the camera, flash and Nokia logo are on the rear of the device, continuing the deceivingly premium look and feel even in those smaller details.. In terms of ports, you've got the usual headphone jack, Micro-USB (no USB-C here, we're afraid), and a microSD slot to expand the on-board storage - though there's no fingerprint sensor or water-proofing to be found here.. Overall, we're big fans of the design of the Nokia 3. It's simple, but it looks great, and people who saw the phone were consistently surprised at how little it cost -. this is a phone that looks premium, even if it isn't.. Inside the Nokia 3 is the MediaTek MTK 6737 quad-core 1.4GHz processor paired with 2GB RAM, which is definitely a budget chipset, so don’t expect anything particularly speedy from this handset. In fact you should expect it to run noticeably slowly - we experienced lag running all but the least demanding apps, and any attempt at multi-tasking is nothing more than an exercise in frustration.. That experience is borne out by our benchmarks, which show a phone that struggles to keep up even compared to budget rivals. At only £20-30 more both the Moto G5 and Wileyfox Swift 2 Plus deliver consistently better performance - both in the raw benchmarks and in actual daily use.. Going beyond processing power, there’s 16GB built-in memory with support for up to 256GB more thanks to the microSD card slot.. The non-removable battery is 2,650mAh, which. manages a day or so of typical usage without too much trouble, but not much more than that - this is definitely a phone where you'll be aware of the need to get back to your charger on a daily basis.. Micro-USB remains fairly standard for the budget market, and it's no surprise to see 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi - though Bluetooth 4.0 is a little less expected, rather than the more modern 4.2 standard. Still, there's one pleasant surprise too: NFC, which drives services like Android Pay, and is rare at this price range. So if you're on a tight budget but want to pay for coffee with your phone, the Nokia 3 might be your best bet.. The cameras are another serious compromise for the Nokia 3, which features near-identical 8Mp. shooters on both the front and rear of the device - the only difference is an LED flash on the back.. The selfie camera will get the job done fine, and is high enough quality for most purposes, but the rear camera is likely to disappoint. Sluggish autofocus makes it tricky to capture fast-moving targets, and photos tend to come out lacking detail:. That's even apparent in more close-range shots, which never quite seem crisp, and the camera struggles even more when dealing with low light conditions:. The included camera app is also a no-nonsense affair, with a few simple options like HDR, but much in the way of effects or filters..
