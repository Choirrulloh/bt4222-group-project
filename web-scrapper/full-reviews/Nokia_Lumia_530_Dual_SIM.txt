Updated On: 26th February 2018. 4.0 2457 Ratings 1 Questions & Answers. The Nokia Lumia 530 is a dual-SIM smartphone that runs on Microsoft Windows 8.1 OS. The device has a 4-inch IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with FWVGA resolution. The smartphone has a 5 MP primary rear camera with fixed-focus. The phone is powered by 1.2 GHz Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 processor. It has 512 MB RAM and 4 GB ROM which is expandable up to 64 GB via microSD card. Connectivity options include 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n , Bluetooth 4.0 and microUSB 2.0 port. The windows phone has a Li-Ion 1430 mAh battery .. Key Specifications Snapdragon 200 processor 512MB RAM 4GB internal storage 1430 mAh battery 5 M.Pixels rear & No selfie 4.0 inch screen Dual SIM (Micro SIM) Microsoft Windows v8.1. Nokia Lumia 530 Dual SIM Price in India. Nokia Lumia 530 Dual SIM Price starts at Rs. Nokia Lumia 530 Dual SIM Details. The Lumia 530 offers a quad-core processor, the Windows Phone operating system, and a 5MP camera for a very low price, especially when compared to other Windows Phone devices.. The Lumia 530 runs the latest version of the Windows Phone OS. Windows Phone 8.1 tops the OS' smooth and fast performance with new features that bring it closer to the competition, such as a notifications menu and a new keyboard that supports swipe input. Users get free access to Microsoft services and apps like Office, OneNote, Skype, Outlook and more, and 30GB of free storage online.. The phone has 4GB of internal storage, which isn't a lot but is made up for by support for 128GB microSD cards. Windows Phone 8.1 is the only operating system that supports app installation on external storage, making the Lumia 530 a top choice for people on a budget but with high storage needs. 512MB of RAM isn't the best feature of the Lumia 530, but a phone of this price is expected to take shortcuts in some specifications.. The Lumia 530 has a 4-inch TFT LCD display with a standard resolution of 800x480 pixels, capable of producing 16 million colours. The phone comes with the Lumia Color profile setting, which allows users to customize the screen's display mode. Under the hood, there is a quad-core Snapdragon 200 processor (1.2GHz) providing the power, which couples with the light operating system to offer a user experience unmatched by most of the competing smartphones.. The device features a 5-megapixel rear camera which is unfortunately a fixed focus unit, making it unsuitable for close-up and macro shots. Imaging is further handicapped by the phone's omission of a front-facing camera, making it yet another aspect where the Lumia 530 might not tick all the boxes for a user. However, battery life is one area where the phone can shine bright, as its 1,430 mAh battery is rated for 22 days of standby time and 10 hours of calling on a 3G network ..

Overall Analysis Of Lumia 530:- I have combined the Pros and Cons under each category. 1) Display-: Lumia 530 has a 4 inch display with 480 x 854 pixels (245 ppi pixel density). It is a TFT capacitive touchscreen with 16M colors. I did not like the display much. It is not as beautiful as I expected from Nokia, but at such an affordable price it is not bad. Viewing angles are not decent enough. But you must like the colourful outlook of the phone with the beautiful tiles with your customized backgrounds. So, it's a plus point at such a price. 2) Battery Life:- This phone has Li-Ion 1430 mAh battery. It lasts for a day after a rigorous use like playing games, watching videos and multitasking. So, if you hate charging your phone after a day then it's not for you. But according to me considering the price, its battery life is commendable. What else do you want from a phone!! It is surely a plus point for me. 3) Camera:- It has a 5MP camera with no flash and a secondary camera. But I liked the primary camera. It captures great pictures(except in low light). But it may be a nightmare for you if you are a selfie fan. This phone is not for photographers or selfie lovers. 4) Build:- The build of the phone is really nice. Nokia makes phones out of plastic (or polycarbonate) which feel really really good in hand. You will love holding this phone in your hand. 5) Software:- In terms of software, I would really appreciate the changes made in the new Windows 8.1 to the enhancements introduced. The new action center, customizable tiles, better performance and optimization, word flow-the great swype keyboard and other features force you to buy this little piece. If you are bored of Android and want to explore Microsoft's innovations in an affordable price range, you must go for it. Performance, RAM and Storage:-This phone comes with only 512 MB RAM which is I guess sufficient to run most of the apps well. Due to the optimizations made in the new Windows 8.1, apps run smoothly with only 512 MB RAM. But if you love heavy games or apps which need at least 1GB RAM, then it's better not to go for it. It has 4GB of internal storage but it's expandable. It runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 Quad core processor. It's an outdated processor but still the performance is smooth as it's a quad core. Overall performance for daily tasks, light games, and other apps is quite good and appreciable. I would consider it a plus point. You also get 15GB of skydrive storage and such other features for Microsoft. Price is around 7k, which is the cheapest in the segment. Nokia makes its phones really great. It lasts long (around 2-3 years). If you love Windows platform or want to try something new and unique, then you must go for it. I would give a 3.8 star rating to it. Hence, I would recommend it to you my friends and relatives!! (read more). Reviewed on MySmartPrice. Report spam 49 0. Nokia mobile price list in India. Panasonic P100 price in India (Rs.

Share your thoughts with other customers. There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great phone at a great price.. This phone is the culmination of a ton of research and headaches, but I am so glad I ended up with it. This phone works incredibly well given the price. I went to Radioshack to look at unlocked phones and I was blown away by the prices. There is no way I'd spend 500 dollars on a phone. If you would, then clearly this review isn't for you. I am not sure why I would need anything better than this. Pros: -The phone is fast and it does everything I need it to do. -Cortana is an excellent personal assistant. I've already told her that I love her. -The interface is intuitive and attractive, much more so than Android and iPhones. -I was able to sync my gmail account effortlessly. -The call quality and reception are excellent. Cons: -I am not the kind of guy who needs a ton of apps. I basically need Spotify, Facebook, and Twitter. If you need a million different apps and games, then a Windows phone probably isn't for you. -This phone is definitely not for someone who wants to take quality pictures. They're not terrible but there's no flash. If you're like me, you don't give a hoot and a half about a camera on a phone. I felt compelled to write this review because I've noticed that this phone doesn't get great reviews. I think my standards are different from those of tech reviewers, because I love this thing.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome Phone. I got this phone from "Wireless Hub", shipped by Amazon. The start up screen was a language selection menu, with English- USA preselected. The dual sim feature is super simple to use and couldn't be set up better. Select one sim or the other to make calls. The phone receives calls from either sim at any time. The sound quality on calls is better than any other phone I've tried, including iphones. Nokia holds a lot of patents in the basic functions of mobile phones, and it shows. I personally think the whole user interface is superior to Android and IOS, and I'm a long time Microsoft hater. Haven't played with the cortana feature yet. I shopped this phone hard, and I don't see how you can beat this phone for functionality and price. The lower priced Blu and Lenovo android phones have cheap CPU's and no GPS. My understanding is that Microsoft takes a loss on every Nokia phone they sell because they want to do whatever it takes to establish decent market share.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Nice phone. Screen could be a little bigger. Dual Sim is convenient when traveling to foreign countries. Windows OS is simple to use.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars great phone for my non tech wife. great phone for my non tech wife, have a chip from the US and one from Mexico and it is very easy to make calls from either.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Four Stars. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great deal on 3G, dual SIM international phone. I received a great price on a good, entry level, dual SIM phone. It is Windows based, which can be a little funky for apps. However, the phone is a great deal. I travel and rent to friends internationally. This phone allows two independent networks to run. I installed a T-Mobile SIM in slot one and used that for data. I used a French Orange SIM in slot 2. The OS allows messaging and calls from either SIM's network. Both show up on the screen, so it is easy to use. The phone accepted my 16GB micro SD card w/o issue, so I was able to connect to my PC via USB and push in ringtones without an issue. Configuration is a bit of a pain because of MS Win requirements for a WIN user account. Other than that, this phone is a dual SIM bargain for 3G..

The viewing angles are slightly reduced compared to other phones in the Lumia line.. The Lumia 530 ships with Microsoft Windows Phone 8.1 , as well as exclusive software like Nokia Mix Radio and HERE Maps (featuring turn-by-turn directions, offline maps and navigation, and transit info).. Ars Technica considers the Lumia 530 a step in the wrong direction. In comparison to its predecessor, the Lumia 520 , the Lumia 530 is worse as it removes the dedicated camera button, has a worse display with poor contrast, color, and viewing angles, and it’s susceptible to backlight bleed and has a worse GPU. The limited amount of RAM makes some games not able to run and cripples the multitasking ability making apps switching slow. PC Advisor also considers the Lumia 530 to be worse than its predecessor, as it has a worse camera with fixed focus, instead of the auto-focus of the predecessor, half the storage size, and a worse graphics processor.

Nokia Lumia 530 Dual sim Overview. A Very Mediocre phone and nothing really stands out.. This is the Lumia 530 Dual sim variant. This phone is the first phone that was released with the Microsoft branding instead of the Nokia ones in the previous models. The phone is an entry level phone and that’s the only segment in which Microsoft actually has any stakes at all. The phone succeeds the Lumia 530 and is a much better phone overall with a bigger screen, bigger battery and a much better camera.. The phone is rather well built and feels sturdy and has a good feel in hands. There’s a slight camera hump on the back but it shouldn’t be too much of a problem as the case protects the camera lens. The loudspeaker is on the back side, which is not really a good place to have the speakers. The back cover is removable and under it lies the removable battery, the 2 sim slots and the SD card slot. Although the phone doesn’t look as premium as other phones in the same price range, it’s got a really solid build inside out.. The phone has 5 MP cameras on back , the rear one obviously better with a ¼” sensor and the lack of front camera is a weird exclusion. The rear camera can only record 480p videos only though sadly. The good thing is that continuous autofocus is available for video recording. The camera has manual options, the focusing speed is rather slow, but the photos come out rather good. Overall it is a good camera but can be laggy at times due to the software.. The phone has a 4.0 inch qHD IPS LCD display which was rather nice when the phone was released, but it’s decent at best right now. The phone has on-screen buttons unlike some of the previous models with capacitive keys. The display has good color reproduction and good viewing angles as well.. The Lumia 530 is powered by Snapdragon 200 1.2 GHz quad core processor, aided with the Adreno 302 GPU. The phone has 8 gigs of internal storage and an SD card slot which supports upto 128gb expansion. The phone also has 512MB of RAM which is very low even for a Windows phone. The phone can only play 720p videos, so 1080p videos just won’t play. Even though Windows phones should perform great, this phone doesn’t do all that well with games, a lot of games tend to lag.. The Lumia 530 comes with Windows 8.1 out of the box. The phone should run smooth in most cases thanks to the super light Windows OS and 512MB of RAM. There have been lags now and then, which Microsoft keep fixing over new updates. Also Microsoft has promised Windows 10 update to all Lumia phones running Windows 8.1 and that will be a welcome boost to this phone as well. The UI is rather simple for people to get used to and understand, but plain and dull at the same time.. The phone has a 1430 mAh battery which seems so less at first sight, but this being an entry level phone with a 480p display running Windows OS on a low end chip doesn’t consume all that much of a battery thus helping it easily last a day of usage. The battery saver mode helps with saving the as well.. The Lumia 530 is a decent phone at best, it should’ve probably been priced much cheaper considering its specs. The phone takes pretty good photos but it’s not always consistent. The 1 GB RAM should’ve been enough, but the phone lags now and then. You should probably only consider buying this phone if you only want a Windows phone and bare basic functions, because the rest of the competition are cheaper and much better.. What’s good : build quality, good battery life , good camera. What’s bad : laggy software, overpriced for it’s specs , dull phone inside out. What is being discussed about mobiles. Smartphone, With Good Battery Backup, Small-medium Size Screen With High Ppi. Rough User(loved Lumia 520), Sturdy, Style And Awesome Performance. Small to medium screen : 3" to 4.5". High ppi screen : 230+ ppi , qHD screens or higher. Battery : should be simply best in its class.. Budget : upto 7000 - 10,000. Suggestions from 6K are also welcome.. Xiaomi Redmi will will be a perfect device for you..it is really a featured packed device for this budget range. It has Snapdragon processor supported with 1GB RAM which can provide you smooth, lagfree expeirence. Features 8GB internal memory, 8MP primary camera and 2MP secondary camera.. Its display quality is also decent with a premium built. So you may try ordering this:. If you don't want to go for this Chinese brand then Moto E can be your option. The stock android, along with its premium rich built makes the device worth for the value:. For Redmi :: Out of Stock is being a problem, else, definitely, there was no doubt, I would have gone for it. Let me know if there are some alternate options to get this phone, with some surcharge even !!. Moto E : I've heard of a tonne of problems with the device, like back cover problem and etc etc.. I have boiled down to :. Lumia 530 Dual Sim @ 6600/- onwards. Zenfone 4 (old n new) @ 6K & 7K. Which among these two, is the winner as per the Reviews/user opinions / or based upon hands on usage by you. In particularly, the battery part ?. Asus has 42.2 Mbps capability vs Nokia one has 21 Mbps. How much more can I expect from Asus in this case ?. Yes, I agree Redmi 1S will not be easy to buy.. and I really like the alternatives you suggested here, This are my 3rd and 4th suggestion in this budget range.. In this comparision, I will list Zenfone 4(New) on 3rd and Lumia on 4th.. Zenfone has really got high internet service with the decent set of specification. The new Zenfone 4 sports bigger and better display and operates on latest android version. and hence if you want Android then you must go for this device. If you are looking for other OS than Android then Lumia 530 should be your buy:. Which phone i will buy among this 4 ????. I usually recommend windows phone under this price range because their life is much longer as compared to the android devices.. because Windows Phone do not require high-end hardware to run fluently and they offer really really less UI lag as compared to Android devices.. I will choose Nokia Lumia 530 as the overall best device.. but then if you specifically need Android and that too with a better camera than Nokia Lumia 530 then you can go for Micromax Canvas Unite 2. I want a phone with these facelities ......windows, dual sim, front camera, FM, Flash, good speed, radiation must be low, brand doesn't matter.. I would like to recommend you three options fitting into your requirements,. I Travel a lot so GPS with gloanass,. Rough phone like lumia, it fell in water twice, from bike twice and from table thrice, survived :).. Graphics is a must, good ram is must.. Camera rear as well as front but not that important.. and moreover, it should be damn reliable.. with the lowest price range as possible.. Size not necessarily big, it should fit in pocket.. Hello Sumeet, I second you with you views here. Nokia Lumia 520 is a nice phone for rough use and having Lumia Style. The only thing i personally didn't like was its a single sim device where as Nokia's X with comparatively lower price rate is offering Dual Sim. As you mentioned that you will be travelling a lot, then having 2 Sim can be an advantage for you. But if you want to have a window operating system go for Lumia 520 and if you can compramise it with Android then have a look over Nokia X:. More about Nokia Lumia 530 Dual sim.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Best for Basic User, No heavy Usage !!!. Writing this review after almost a year of purchase. I bought this last diwali,and i am very much happy with this Nokia Lumia. I am not a heavy user of mobile as i am always on PC but still the battery lasts. I am using it for basic use only like texting and Calling. Just 512mb RAM but still works smooth with basic apps installed. I am added 16gb HP Memory card to expand this. Loving the fact that its expandable capacity is 128gb. This is one hell of a durable Piece. I have dropped it almost 10-12 times from 3-4 feet height. NOKIA, Name is enough they said, Well Said !!!.

Good Build and simple design | Battery Life | Dual-SIM | Windows Phone 8.1 | Pricing. Poor Camera | Missing Front Shooter | Performance | Low Resolution Display. The era of good old feature phones may have gone by, but Nokia, after a generation of success, still continues to search for its real identity. While the Nokia Lumia 520 seemed to have captured at least a sprinkling of the magic that fuelled the Lumia 520's triumph in the affordable segment, the company's toughest task this year will be to retain its market share. With the incoming of new age brands, such as Xiaomi and Oppo, Nokia's position today is as tough as it's ever been.. Nokia's biggest challenge in 2014 is to churn out top quality Windows Phone 8.1-powered smartphones under Rs. In fact, we have seen some spark and enthusiasm amongst mainstream consumers when Nokia launched its Lumia 630 earlier in the year. ‘Affordability' is the keyword what Nokia should be aiming for, since a large number of Indian consumers usually spend less than $100 or Rs. There's a lot of potential in the low-end of the smartphone market, and Nokia no doubt hope to see its latest little wonder, the Lumia 530, takes off well. It's basically a low-end phone running on the latest Windows Phone 8.1 OS. We got a chance to explore the device, and here's our first impression.. Nokia Lumia 530 Dual SIM: Form Factor, Design, Display and Operating System. The Lumia 530, no doubt, is the lowest-price Windows phone to date. Like any other budget phone, it feels sturdy and tough from outside. We bet you won't need a case with your Lumia 530.. Notably, the textured plastic back feels smooth, though we initially found it tough to remove the back casing. In terms of build and design, the phone seems to be chunky at 11.7mm. But it does look smart, thanks to its rounded edges.. Remove the back cover off and you'll notice the removable battery, the microSD card slot and dual-SIM support. On the rear, the Lumia 530 has a 5-megapixel camera with no LED Flash, and there's no front-facing shooter.. The handset features a low-resolution 4-inch display with a resolution of 480 x 854-pixels. Firstly, the screen is so small, plus we found it so reflective under appropriate lighting. Take it outside, however, the display quickly becomes faded.. It also picks up fingerprints easily, making it difficult to read the screen in bright settings.. The Nokia Lumia 530 runs Windows Phone 8.1 - the latest version of Microsoft's mobile OS. If you have already experienced the Windows Phone 8, it'll look and feel similar. But there's some improvements being made to make the OS - at par with Android and iOS.. Firstly, you'll notice a drop-down menu and better keyboard experience. The OS, itself, is very smooth and fast, without any lag you might see in some low-end Android-powered phones..

Nokia Lumia 530 Dual-SIM Hands-on Video. Nokia Lumia 530 Dual-SIM Hands-on Photos. It looks like there’s a race between manufacturers to make the cheapest smart phone that’s still decent enough to use. The Nokia Lumia 530 is Microsoft’s entry with an incredible low price of RM355 and it runs on the latest Windows Phone 8.1. That’s quite impressive considering it is priced lower than its recently axed Nokia X which we are not impressed with .. Now back to the Lumia 530, it is cheap but Microsoft didn’t sacrifice too much on the hardware for the sake of price. The exterior is undoubtedly a Lumia with its bright polycarbonate shells and the screen is a decent 4″ LCD with a 854×480 pixels resolution which is still acceptable in this price range. The biggest boasting points is its Quad-Core 1.2GHz processor from Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 200 range with 512MB of RAM and it gets a microSD slot which accepts the largest 128GB capacity.. The on-board storage is still small at 4GB and for those love taking pictures would need to lower their expectation with its rather basic 5MP camera that lacks an LED flash. At the front, there’s no front facing camera. Despite being a low entry device, the Lumia 530 gives you the latest Windows Phone 8.1 experience which brings transparent Live tiles, action centre and Word Flow gesture keyboard which we find it to work pretty accurately. One of the unique features you’ll get with Windows Phone is its Maps with HERE Drive+ navigation.. At the moment, there are 300,000 apps on the Windows Phone platform and Microsoft has been aggressively closing up the app gap with the latest popular apps including Waze, Vine and Instagram. While it is low in price and having just 512MB of RAM, the Lumia 530 feels smooth in our brief hands-on. For those who travel a lot or subscribe to 2 telco providers, the Lumia 530 supports Dual-SIMs in 3G HSPA+ connectivity up to 21Mbps. The back cover shell is removable and gives you access to its 1,430mAh capacity battery and underneath you’ll find a microSD slot and 2 slots for SIM Cards.. In the hands, it feels quite solid but the curve that flows immediately from the edge towards the back makes it quite slippery to hold if you’re in a hurry. Over at the front, there are no physical buttons as it uses on-screen buttons like the higher-end Lumia 630. The power and volume rockers are located on the right which is easily accessed with a single hand.. When the Lumia 530 was announced, most people would assume that this is a direct replacement of their Lumia 525 which was their former entry level Windows Phone model. Although they look similar, the Lumia 525 is still a notch higher with an IPS display, 1GB of RAM, larger 8GB of storage and a 5MP camera that can do HD 720p videos and it even comes with a dedicated camera button.. The biggest growth in smart phone market is expected to come from its low price segment and most Chinese manufacturers have already dominated the sub-RM600 segment. For less than RM400, Nokia is targeting to capture the first time smart phone buyers and feature phone upgraders that are looking for a decent device without spending too much. Low price entry level seems to be the way to go and hopefully the Lumia 530 would give Windows Phone platform an even bigger impact than it did with the Lumia 520 / 525 ..

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 4 GB + MicroSD. Discontinued: T-Mobile , Cricket. Based on 1 User reviews. Does not support automatic screen brightness. Too little RAM memory (0.5 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (245 ppi). Loaded with Windows Phone 8.1 out of the box, the Lumia 530 brings the goods, such as the new Action Center, Word Flow, personalized Start Screen background, HERE Maps, and Cortana. Powering all this goodness is a tidy quad-core 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 CPU. There is 512MB of RAM and 4GB of storage, the latter of which can be expanded via microSD card up to 128GB. There is a 5MP main camera and while there is no front facing camera, you can use voice commands to take selfies with the main camera using the Glam Me app. The Lumia 530 is a 3G smartphone, so data speeds will peak at about 21Mbps on an HSPA network. Of course, there is Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, and Wi-Fi connectivity all baked in. The display is a 4-inch, 854x480 resolution LCD.. Dimensions: 4.71 x 2.45 x 0.46 inches (119.7 x 62.3 x 11.7 mm). Weight: 4.55 oz (129 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 480 x 854 pixels. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Face detection, Voice activation, Geo tagging. Settings: ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Panorama, Night mode, Scenes. Resolution, 864 x 480 pixels 30 fps. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 13.40 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 22.0 days (528 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 10.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. Data: HSDPA+ (4G) 21.1 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s. Notifications: Service lights, Music ringtones (MP3, WAV), Vibration, Phone profiles, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording, TTY/TDD. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. GPS, A-GPS, Glonass, Cell ID, Wi-Fi positioning. Navigation: Turn-by-turn navigation, Voice navigation, Points of interest (POI). Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Nokia Lumia 530 Dual SIM Review: Windows Phone 8.1 Made Affordable. Ershad Kaleebullah , 11 September 2014. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Nokia Lumia 530 Dual SIM in pictures. Long before the widely praised Moto E , the fairly competent Asus Zenfone 4 or the new crowd favourite Xiaomi Redmi 1S took the budget smartphone market in India by storm, there was one phone that stood out - the Nokia Lumia 520. This phone was a surprise hit for both Microsoft and Nokia, and it introduced first-time users to a polished smartphone experience without having to dig deep into their pockets.. The Nokia Lumia 520 and its successor, the Nokia Lumia 525 , have both received the Windows Phone 8.1 update via the Lumia Cyan update, but Microsoft has also announced the Nokia Lumia 530 Dual SIM, which comes with the update preloaded. However, taking a look at the specifications of the Lumia 530 Dual SIM on paper, it doesn't actually look like an upgrade to the Lumia 520. The asking price is much lower this time around, which puts it in a lower market segment.. It is no secret that the battle for the title of best low-cost smartphone is very hot at the moment and the Nokia Lumia 530 Dual SIM has a tough fight on its hands to emerge victorious.. Look and feel One thing that Nokia always seemed to get right with almost every single new launch was design. Despite being chunky at 11.7mm, the subtly curved edges of the Lumia 530 Dual SIM make it feel ergonomic. The phone is of course made completely using plastic but it doesn't feel cheap. The matte white variant that we received was extremely slippery and difficult to hold, but it's small enough that using it with one hand is not going to be a problem at all.. The 4-inch screen is surrounded by medium-sized borders. Nokia/Microsoft decided to go with on-screen buttons instead of capacitive buttons below the screen. Unfortunately, that takes up precious real estate, which is already lacking. Above the screen is an earpiece. The right edge has a power button and a volume rocker. A Micro-USB port lies on the bottom while a 3.5mm audio jack sits on top. The rear has the primary camera and a circular speaker grill. It is easy to pry the rear cover off by pulling on a corner. Once opened, you'll see that the fairly stocky battery covers the two SIM card slots and the memory card slot.. Specifications and software Under the hood of the Nokia Lumia 530 Dual SIM is the same processor that is inside the Motorola Moto E - a Qualcomm Snapdragon 200. However, it is the quad-core variant of the processor. It has an integrated Adreno 302 GPU. Disappointingly, there is only 512MB of RAM. We will see if this affects the performance later in the review. The phone has 4GB of storage space, of which only around a gigabyte is available for users. It is a relief then that the phone also accepts microSD cards of up to 64GB.. There is a 5-megapixel fixed-focus rear camera but no flash. The two SIM cards can connect to 3G networks. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 are the other connectivity standards. A 1430mAh battery provides the juice for the phone to work.. The 4-inch LCD panel on the phone is a step down from the IPS LCD panel on the Nokia Lumia 520. It has a resolution of 480x854, and this is probably the lowest quality display we've ever seen on a Nokia smartphone. The viewing angles are awful, with the screen washing out with even the slightest of hand movements. Sunlight legibility is really bad even at the highest brightness setting. There is very evident screen tearing when scrolling through the apps pane. We are supremely disappointed that Microsoft had to cut corners like this.. Windows Phone 8.1 has a lot of new useful updates and it is catching up to a feature-rich platform like Android. However, in our review of the Lumia 630 we noted that Windows Phone 8.1 still has a lot of catching up to do. One still has to arrange the Live Tiles carefully for the transparent background option to look good; on-screen buttons are visible when playing videos just like we mentioned earlier; the implementation of the Back button as a multitasking shortcut is still confusing; and the Marketplace is missing many useful apps and fun games.. We loved the additional apps such as Battery Saver, Data Sense, Wi-Fi Sense and Storage Sense as they do exactly what their names suggest. While Nokia's signature apps MixRadio and Nokia Camera are present, Here Maps and Here Drive+ are missing. Bookmyshow and Snapdeal are the two third-party apps that are preinstalled on the device.. Camera It's been a long time since we last saw Nokia opting for a fixed-focus camera on any smartphone. The 5-megapixel rear camera captures good details and colours in daylight provided it can manage to lock focus on the subject. On the other hand, you'll have to forget about capturing subjects that are very close to you.. Images captured in low light conditions are serviceable. The camera on the Lumia 530 Dual SIM can capture only 480p videos, which is a significant step down from the 720p and 1080p options available on other phones. The quality of captured video is not too great. The camera app has a good number of manual options available for users who wish to tweak settings, but we don't know why anyone would bother doing so with a fixed-focus camera. To be fair to the Lumia 530 Dual SIM, even the Moto E has a fixed focus camera, and the former's is much better than the latter's.. Performance In daily use, we noticed that the phone stuttered a bit while opening apps but it wasn't too apparent. This could be because of the relatively low 512MB of RAM. Otherwise, most of our experiences during daily usage were good.. AnTuTu returned a score of 11,485 and WPbench touched 241.09, which is okay. We played a few HD videos which worked fine, but FHD ones refused to play. The earphones bundled with the device are not of the in-ear kind, but they serve the purpose well. The loudspeaker gets really, really loud. In our battery test the phone managed to last us 7 hours and 22 minutes before it died. This is not bad at all and we noticed that it lasted us a day and half in real-world conditions.. Verdict At the moment the Lumia 530 Dual SIM is available for around Rs. The price is low for a phone that can provide a decent smartphone experience, but unfortunately the Moto E , the Xiaomi Redmi 1S and the Asus Zenfone 4 all provide better smartphone experiences at the same price.. Buy this phone only if you want a really cheap device running Windows Phone 8.1. The Lumia 630 and the Lumia 520 have seen price drops and are also available for less than Rs. Those two older devices are better options if you don't mind spending only a little bit more..

Right now, its the most affordable Windows Phone available in India. Despite the affordable price, Nokias offering a 1.2Ghz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 processor, thus offering a speedy performance. The display is 4-inch in size that offers a 854 x 480 pixel resolution and 249.9PPI. The camera is a 5 megapixel fixed focus one (unlike the Lumia 520s autofocus sensor), and misses out on LED flash and also a front camera is missing. Alongside 4GB of internal storage (which is half of the Lumia 520s 8GB internal storage), Nokia is offering 128GB microSD card support to expand your storage. The device comes with a removable 1430 mAh battery. It runs on Windows Phone 8.1 with Lumia Cyan Update. Lumia 530 Dual SIM comes pre-loaded with apps like Line, Viber, Skype, Yahoo! Messenger, Twitter, Shazam, Microsoft Office, Vine, Facebook and Instagram Beta. Just like other Lumia handsets, this one too comes with 15GB of free OneDrive cloud storage. Its available in Bright Orange, Bright Green, Dark Grey, and White colour variants. Video About Nokia Lumia 530 Dual SIM. Nokia Lumia 530 Dual SIM Price History. Save Money - Get Price Drop Alerts!.
