A new version of the Nokia 3310 with 4G is on its way (Update: Coming to China in February). by Team AA 4 weeks ago. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. HMD Global has confirmed that it’s bringing a 4G version of the Nokia 3310 to China. The retro feature phone will launch in the region in February and features the same design, display, and camera as the regular 3G or 2G versions.. As noted in the previous TENAA listing, the Nokia 3310 4G is powered by YunOS, indicating a wider array of app support. 4G VoLTE has also been confirmed (via Fone Arena ).. There’s no word on pricing at time of writing or any hint of a wider release schedule. It’s worth keeping your eyes peeled during HMD Global’s showcase at MWC 2018 for the latter, as the Finnish firm could be looking to the old school device to grab some attention a year on from the phone’s initial revival.. Original story (12/28/2017): Smartphones might be all the rage, but feature phones deserve some love too. Nokia made one of the best feature phones of all time with the Nokia 3310 .Â. revived the device after it began producing Nokia phones and later came out with a 3G version. The first version could connect to a very limited number of bands, but the 3G version offered much better connectivity.. Now, HMD is back with another version of the Nokia 3310, and this time it’s packing 4G. device passing through TENAA, the Chinese regulatory body for telecommunication devices. Luckily for fans of the device, it looks the same as ever.. This Putin-Trump edition Nokia 3310 is the worst way to spend $2,500. To mark the historic meeting of Trump and Putin, a Russian company is selling a Putin-Trump edition of the Nokia 3310 for a whopping $2,500.. All eyes are on the G-20 summit right now: â¦. One of the only changes is the operating system.Â. VTechgrapgy points out that the 3310 4G will run YunOS instead of Feature OS or s30+, which were the two operating systems powering the 2G and 3G versions, respectively. YunOS is able to run some apps that we see on Android, as it’s based on AOSP. That leaves us wondering if we’ll see some stripped down versions of apps like WhatsApp make its way onto the 3310 4G.. We know this isn’t going to be the most popular phone out there, but it might be a fun deviceÂ. to pick up for nostalgia’s sake and to use as a backup. Now that it can connect to 4G, there’s no danger of it being left in the dust as carriers will eventually shutter 3G networks in the future.. We’re still awaiting pricing details for the Nokia 3310.Â. The 3G version of the phone launched at $60, so we’d expect this one to include a small increase. If it’s anything under $100, you’ll see me at the head of the line.. Please enter a valid email address. Android Authority APP Get it on. Your source for all things Android!.

The Nokia 3310 is a blast from the past.. When we first saw the retro. Nokia 3310 last February, it was nostalgia-laced. The colorful little phone reminded us of simpler times when T9Word was the best way to text your friends and before you'd "accidentally" spend hours scrolling through social media feeds.

We're also hoping to see the 4G version in other global markets.. China is an important market for many phone makers, who look at the world's most populous country as a quick way to gain global market share. The Nokia 3310's rock-bottom price tag could help it get a foothold in cities and provinces where citizens can't afford to buy the highest-priced smartphones.. Perhaps we'll hear more about the 3310 4G at next month's. (MWC) trade show, where -- in addition to 3310 news -- we were promised to see something "awesome.".

ValueWalk Breaking News, Business, Politics, Technology. The Nokia 3310 4G Is Expected To Launch In Early 2018. Nokia has a reputation for indestructible phones, but for a phone to be heavy duty to that extent, a fragile glass screen isn’t always an option. 4G isn’t intended to be a competitor to high-end luxury flagships, but rather serves as a hybrid device – a combination of basic phone with some elevated features.. HMD Global has seen some good success after their recent acquisition of the Nokia brand. However, expecting to compete with established flagship producers like Samsung and Apple is a bit of a tall order for a company that has fallen behind in technology. Nokia had some pretty durable phones back in the day, and HMD Global hopes to capitalize on the brand’s reputation for reliable and affordable phones with the Nokia 3310.. The original Nokia 3310 in its time was a far cry from a smartphone. With 3G and even 4G technology becoming the standard for mobile networks, it’s clear that the Nokia 3310 needed a revamp to keep up with the times. The Nokia 3310 4G is about ready to launch, and the phone will ship with more than a simple update to support 4G technology.. Back in September, a 3G-enabled Nokia 3310 was released , and soon we’ll see the 4G version. Accompanying this new technology is that the new operating system is YunOS. Previous versions of the phone ran on HMD’s proprietary Feature OS – which admittedly was a little lackluster when compared to modern operating systems. YunOS is developed by Alibaba and is an offshoot of the Android Open Source project. Long story short, the Nokia 3310 will truly be an Android phone.. Outside of the upgrade to 4G capabilities and the fact that the phone will be running an Android operating system, we don’t know very much about the upcoming Nokia 3310. However, HMD Global has an opportunity on their hands to capture than non-insignificant portion of the market that is looking for an affordable and reliable phone – albeit without all the bells and whistles we’ve come to expect from flagships.. The move to Android is particularly significant, and could mean that we’ll see more smart features with the phone. Provided the specifications of the Nokia 3310 are up to snuff, we could see support for popular apps. Running off of YunOS and being based off of Android may give the phone access to the Google Play Store, which has a huge amount of apps that provide added convenience to the new phone.. By updating the operating system to an Android-based system, HMD Global is giving Nokia users a path towards modern convenience while still retaining the accessibility and nostalgic design that Nokia users desire.. However, despite the affordability and utility of the Nokia 3310, there are some questions to whether the reduced price is enough of a draw to warrant giving up some basic smartphone features. While the original Nokia phones were massively successful, technology has come a long way since that point and the market has gotten used to a selection of phones that offer more than just a basic handset.. Photos of the upcoming Nokia 3310 were obtained from TENNA, and seem to indicate that the design won’t be a major departure from previous version.. Window had the rights to the Nokia brand for quite some time, but didn’t do much with it. HMD Global recently acquired the company, and has quickly set out on a path to re-establish Nokia as a modern brand that offers something unique to consumers.. Like many smartphone manufacturers, HMD Global is offering phones at varying price points and with varying capabilities. With the Nokia 6 offering an impressive amount of power at an affordable price, and now the Nokia 3310 4G updating the typical “dumb phone” to a modern operating system with expanded capabilities, the company seems dedicated to bringing Nokia back into the limelight.. What exactly the future has in store for HMD Global and the Nokia brand remains to be seen, but nostalgia can only drive sales so far. The Nokia 3310 4G is a unique product in a sea of smartphones that have traded durability and basic utility for fancy new features. There’s no doubt that there’s a market for high-end flagships, and the majority of the people are becoming more and more reliant on a phone that can act as a pocket-sized computer, but for those of us who need a phone that just plain “works,” The Nokia 3310 4G is an attractive option with a rapidly approaching release.. The Nokia 3310 4G is expected to debut next month, launching alongside the Nokia 6 in early 2018..

Nokia 3310 4G variant receives TENAA certification. Updated: Friday, December 29, 2017, 8:06 [IST]. Early next month, Nokia is highly anticipated to release two smartphones - the Nokia 6 (2018) and the Nokia 9 flagship model. Apart from these, the company is also believed to launch the 4G feature phone alleged to be the Nokia 3310 4G.. We have already seen the Nokia 6 (2018) edition clear the Chinese certification database TENAA. Now, the rumored Nokia 4G feature phone has also passed through the TENAA certification database. Notably, we have come across reports pointing that this feature phone has cleared the Bluetooth SIG certification as well as the US-based FCC regulatory certification.. TENAA has revealed the pictures of the alleged 4G handset and it looks similar to the existing Nokia 3310 (2017) 3G model that was launched a few months back and slightly larger than the 2G model with more spacing between the keys to render a better typing experience. The TENAA listing confirms the support for 4G LTE network and reveals that the device will run Alibaba's YunOS platform.. As 2G networks are not in use in many countries, the Nokia 3310 3G was launched. The device came with a different Series 30+ OS supporting social media apps such as Twitter, Facebook and Skype. The upgrade to 3G impacted the battery life of the handset as it renders 6.5 hours of talk time instead of 22.1 hours of talk time on the 2G variant. The 4G Nokia 3310 variant might take the battery life further down.. Moreover, if the Nokia 3310 4G variant is launched, then it will be priced relatively higher than the 3G and 2G variants of the device, so we need to wait for its launch to know more details.. Lately, we came across a report that the Nokia 4G feature phone will be a revamped Nokia E71 featuring a QWERTY keypad. But the recent listing on TENAA showing the alleged images of the device shows that the handset could be identical to the Nokia 3310 3G. So we need to wait for more reports to surface online regarding the upcoming Nokia handset or an official confirmation from HMD to get clarity on this device..

Nokia 3310 4G casually goes official in China, commercially launching next month. Adrian Diaconescu January 30, 2018 6:11 am. One by one, HMD Global’s “awesome” new Nokia-branded phones expected to be showcased at Barcelona’s Mobile World Congress next month are revealing their secrets, starting with the second-generation Nokia 6 that’s already up for grabs in China.. A flagship Nokia 9 smartphone has been rumored for many months now , an upper mid-range 7 Plus disclosed its SoC upgrade yesterday in a pre-release benchmark, while the entry-level Nokia 3310 4G has just popped up on the company’s official Chinese website.. We obviously can’t be certain this will go international at MWC 2018 in late February, but the unlikely revival of the hugely successful 2000 “dumb phone” began with a surprisingly entertaining announcement at the previous MWC trade show .. Since then, the “reimagined classic” got a 3G boost allowing it to work properly in the US and. other sophisticated cellular markets around the world, and now, the redesigned Nokia 3310 is truly getting with the times.. China Mobile will apparently carry the new 4G-enabled version starting sometime next month, although pricing remains under wraps. In addition to LTE and VoLTE support, this bad boy has Wi-Fi hotspot capabilities going for it, as well as 256MB RAM and 512MB internal storage space. It also runs YunOS, which is a forked but incompatible version of the open-source Android platform.. Coated in your choice of “fresh blue” or “dark black”, the Nokia 3310 4G seems to be otherwise identical to the 3G-only model, including a 320 x 240 2.4-inch screen, 2MP camera with LED flash, and 1200mAh battery. 3g , 4G , 4G LTE , Android , China , HMD , HMD Global , MWC , MWC 2018 , News , Nokia , Nokia 3310 , Nokia 3310 4G , Rumors , YunOS. 3g , 4G , 4G LTE , Android , China , HMD , HMD Global , MWC , MWC 2018 , News , Nokia , Nokia 3310 , Nokia 3310 4G , Rumors , YunOS.

News Nokia 3310 4G vs Reliance JioPhone: The battle of 'smart' feature phones. Nokia 3310 4G vs Reliance JioPhone: The battle of 'smart' feature phones. The new Nokia 3310 4G runs on forked Android-based YunOS, whereas the JioPhone runs on Kai OS.. Published: January 31, 2018 1:45 PM IST. Nokia 3310 4G vs JioPhone pricing. Nokia 3310 4G vs JioPhone operating system. Nokia 3310 4G vs JioPhone specifications. Over the past couple of years, smartphones have become quite affordable, thanks to tough competition from Chinese rivals. Despite the increasing number of upgrades from feature phones to smartphones, Reliance Jio went ahead to launch JioPhone. The company believes there are still a vast pool of users for whom a smartphone is still out of budget. Besides, there are others who aren’t comfortable with the idea of a touch-based phone.. The JioPhone includes most smartphone features such as high-speed 4G LTE with VoLTE connectivity, an internet browser, voice assistant and the ability to stream live TV, movies and music. It also has a secondary camera for video calling. Now, HMD Global , a start-up that revived the iconic Nokia brand, has launched a new 4G variant of the highly popular Nokia 3310, and it runs on forked Android OS. Here’s a closer look how they compete against each other.. HMD Global silently unveiled the Nokia 3310 4G in China, without revealing its price and availability. It’s expected to showcase the Nokia 3310 4G next month at MWC 2018 in Barcelona, and announce availability and pricing details.. Nokia 3310 4G variant with Android-based YunOS launched in China. The JioPhone, on the other hand, is ‘effectively’ priced zero. Customers need to pay Rs 1,500 at the time of buying the phone, and this amount will be refunded after three-years of usage.. The software department is where things get pretty interesting. The revived Nokia 3310 2G and Nokia 3310 3G models that were launched last year run on Nokia’s S30+ operating system, and it was very limited in terms of functionality. Now, the new 4G variant brings high-speed 4G connectivity, along with YunOS, which is a forked Android version made by China’s Alibaba group.. But before you get too excited after reading Android-based Nokia 3310, calm down. Android OS is optimized for touchscreen, which means, you will not be able to download and install APK files of your favorite games and apps. Barring that, Nokia 3310 4G variant in China comes pre-loaded with popular apps for music, books and audiobooks. If HMD Global plans to release the global variant of the phone which also runs on Android, there is a high chance it may come with stripped version of apps such as Facebook and WhatsApp, which will give it an advantage over JioPhone.. JioPhone Review: The ‘smart’ feature phone for the masses. The JioPhone, on the other hand, runs on custom version of Firefox OS called Kai OS. The phone comes with Jio suite of apps, such as JioCinema, JioMusic and JioTV, JioMoney, and voice-activated Google Search app as well.. Both, the Nokia 3310 4G and the JioPhone comes with a 2.4-inch QVGA display running at 320×240 pixels. There is no word on the chipset that powers the Nokia 3310 4G, but it is paired with 256MB of RAM and 512MB of internal storage, which is expandable using a microSD card.. The JioPhone, on the other hand, is powered by a dual-core SoC, paired with 512MB of RAM and 4GB internal storage, which is expandable using a microSD card. Also, JioPhone has a front-facing camera, NFC and a bigger 2,000mAh battery compared to 1,200mAh one on the new Nokia 3310 4G.. Reliance Jio: From cashless payments based on sound waves to home automation, the company has big plans for India. Rest of the specifications are more or less the same. Both smartphones feature a 2-megapixel rear camera, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, 4G VoLTE and microUSB port for charging. In case of the Nokia 3310 4G, support for Wi-Fi hotspot is also present, something that is absent from the JioPhone.. Clearly, the JioPhone looks better overall, especially when you consider built-in voice assistant, battery capacity, NFC for cashless tap-and-pay option, and yes, more RAM and internal storage..

How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. Nokia 3310 4G to run Android-based YunOS. JC Torres - Dec 29, 2017. It seems that HMD Global has found a new cash cow, though more emphasis on the cow than on the cash. The Nokia 3310, even en masse, won’t be able to match the profits from higher end mobile devices, but that’s not stopping HMD Global from milking the popular feature phone for all its worth. HMD followed up the regular 2G model with a more Internet-friendly 3G variant. Now it seems that a Nokia 3310 4G is ready to launch, but it will have more than just a new network connection to boast about.. The original Nokia 3310 was never meant to support the 3G and 4G networks that weren’t in wide use, or didn’t even exist, during its time. It was a “dumb phone” by today’s standards and probably wouldn’t really sell that much today other than for nostalgia.. And so HMD Global deigned to update the classic with more than just a visual refresh but also new capabilities. In September, it put out a 3G-enabled Nokia 3310. Spotted in TENAA is another 3310, this time model TA-1077, with 4G capabilities.. The most interesting part, however, is that TENNA notes that the phone’s operating system is YunOS. Previous models ran on HMD’s own Feature OS, which was based on the Series 30+, a.k.a. More than just a different operating system, YunOS, developed by Alibaba, was forked off the Android Open Source Project, a.k.a. In other words, this is pretty much an Android Nokia 3310.. What that means in practice, however, remains to be seen. The Nokia 3310 hardly has the hardware to make for even a bearable Android experience. As to how long we’ll have to wait to know, the Nokia 3310 4G is expected to debut next month, alongside the Nokia 6 (2018).. Topics Alibaba Android Nokia Nokia 3310 Phones.

Nokia 3310 4G With VoLTE Quietly Launched In China, MWC Global Launch Expected. By Ken Manbert Salcedo On 01/30/18 AT 9:26 AM. HMD Global has officially launched the 4G-compatible Nokia 3310.

The Nokia 3310 4G is also the very first Nokia feature phone from the company to support 4G LTE connectivity.. Another thing that’s different in the Nokia 3310 4G is the operating system that’s running. Unlike the 2G and 3G versions, the Nokia 3310 4G runs YunOS instead of Feature OS or s30+. YunOS is based on the Android open Source Project and this. the Nokia 3310 4G will be able to run some. apps made for Android phones, according to Android Authority ..
