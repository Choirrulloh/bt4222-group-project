Last year, we have seen some major upgrades with iPhone and. Apple is also working on upcoming iWatch Series 3 for this year. Now, let’s begin with latest rumors and leaks of iPhone 8 smartphone.. Thing you are going to know about iPhone 8 here :. What are latest Updates for next Apple iPhone? What the latest rumors of iPhone8? When is Apple going to launch iPhone8? iPhone 8 & 8 Plus Camera Features Specifications and features How much iPhone 8 will cost you? Why should you wait for iPhone?. No, doubt that iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is now one of the best-selling smartphone series in the market and doing wonders for Apple. As we all know Apple believes in “ doing less but doing better “. smooth performance and amazing camera features. But we are expecting something really cool in 2017, we want iPhone 8 to be different, that offers ultra fast performance, better camera capabilities, easy connectivity and long battery life. Here we are going to discuss more on the. specification, features, and rumors of Upcoming iPhone 8 and iPhone8 Plus smartphones .. Apple iPhone 8 Concepts and Renders. Apple is working on different designs for the upcoming flagship, it won’t have physical home button anymore, will contain a more edgy display, bright colors, slimmer sides. Below is one of the most appealing renders of iPhone 8 :. Q1, 2017 : Apple is going to use Stainless Steel in the production of next iPhone and will have Glass Sandwich. Yes, this year we are going to have iPhone having all glass in back and rear with metal frame in between. The phone also going to support wireless charging but for the short distance. As per the reports, Apple is upgrading iPhone with fast charging that may charge your iPhone from 0 to 100% in just 15 minutes. This can be biggest upgrades to any iPhone ever.. Apple can incorporate with Synaptic for new Touch ID!. Rumors are coming that Apple will no longer use the Touch ID button on the front panel of iPhone. Instead this year they are looking to come with new OLED display which may be around 5.8 inches large adding up seamless beauty to iPhone 8 design. New Synaptic Touch ID will be used which can detect fingerprints from display and upgraded pressure sensitive display it will be something new to iPhone users.. Will there be a Flexible IPS LCD?. Yes, Apple is secretly working on new flexible IPS LCD display. But we are still not sure that Apple will use this in its upcoming phablet as OLED already rumored and leaked many times. But as if now there is no confirmation from Apple. There is a huge possibility for Apple to come up with three variants, one with 5.8 inch OLED display and other two with 4.7 and 5.15 inch featuring IPS LCD display.. A more general case will lead to three iPhone 8 variant this year. Apple is also testing one model having a similar design as iPhone 5 with major improvement like they have done in past by launching iPhone SE. It will have all the features of iPhone 7+ in 5.1-inch size.. Q2, 2017 : As per the latest iPhone 8 rumors, we may get a bezel-less display with the upcoming phablet. Few recently leaked reports from China has shown a design having an uneven bezel at the front facing the camera, which doesn’t seem good from any angle. Also, reports came that there might be a bit delay in iPhone 8 release. WAIT! it just new breaking through few internal sources, no official confirmation. We may consider an IFA launch but can’t say about the availability.. Do you wanna see “ How upcoming iPhone 8 / iPhone X will look like? “, will it have bezels?. *Note: Its iPhone X without any Touch ID. However, iPhone 8 has inherited the Home button from its predecessors.. A few years later in 2007, Apple Inc. has launched a smartphone called “ iPhone ” which is their first generation mobile phone with 2G network availability. From then this is 2017, and it’s going to the 10th anniversary of Apple iPhones. We have seen much innovations in mobile technology in the mean time. Now we have 4G LTE and further moving up to next level. The technology has gone beyond what we can think in 2007.. In 2015, Apple has introduced it iPhone 6 Smartphone series which is really high-end mobile that time but time changes and need. Now looking forward to next generation Smartphone, Apple is preparing iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus for 2017. Apple iPhone 7 & 7 Plus already groundbreaking devices but still, we need refinement in many areas. First things that come to my mind after reviewing iPhone 7 Plus is, it needs to have a better design.. Even the phone has 5.5 in display reaching out to its power button is quite hectic sometimes and also the phone can be made slicker with no 3.5 mm jack. We may find this refinement in Apple iPhone 8 and 8 Plus models this year.. Here we are going to talk about the expectation of most anticipated Apple iPhone which is going to launch in late 2017. Apple iPhone 8 is going to be a special Smartphone as it will come on the 10th anniversary of Apple iPhone.. Before we go into “ details of upcoming Apple iPhone8 ” we would like to bring some light to what we have with iPhone 7 last year. Here are some highlighted specifications of iPhone7.. So, these are some highlights for iPhone 7 specifications. Now looking forward to next generation device “ Apple iPhone 8. This time Apple is going to present an innovative smartphone model with having slick design and powerful specs. Apple is also preparing OS 11 ( OS XI ) for both iPhone 8. which is will reduce its power consumption and improve performance as well.. Here we have most expected specifications of upcoming iPhone 8 smartphone. It’s going to be a beast mobile with powerful specs and amazing features.. 4.7 inches 750 x 1334 pixels ~326 ppi pixel density. 5.1 inches, 1080 x 1920 pixels ~401 ppi pixel density. 5.8inches, 1125 x 2436 pixels ~458 ppi pixel density). Apple iPhone8 is going to have some really innovative technology like fast charging, Retina Scanner, Li-Fi and upgraded fingerprint scanner etc. Rumors are also pointing towards edge-to-edge display in iPhone 8 like we have seen with Galaxy S7 Edge. talk about all these features in details now.. Apple is going to switch from conventional IPS display technology soon after the launch of iPhone 7. Next Apple iPhone is going to have OLED display which will offer wider viewing angle with improved brightness. These displays also help Apple to optimize iPhone8 power consumption as OLED display has a high response time and are much efficient. It can have a maximum of 4k resolution. For now, we think 4k is out of reach for Apple, but yes it will have amazing screen resolution with latest upgrades. The phone is also going to have sapphire glass protection which is far better than current Gorilla Glass 4. The sapphire is one of the toughest glass material on the earth and completely unbreakable. So, you won’t have to worry about scratches on your iPhone.. According to rumors, it’s going to be large Smartphone which can be a good move as these days people prefer to use large display phones a lot. As per few reports, Apple may come up with 3 models. Two models with conventional 4.7 and 5.5-inch display having IPS LCD while iPhone 8 Plus. model with 5.8 inch OLED display. Rumors are also coming that Apple will launch an homage design with upcoming iPhone. It may have “ Water-drop design ” featuring more gentle curve at the bottom. The phone is further protected by Gorilla Glass 5 technology and this time Apple is going to bring an unbreakable iPhone.. We all know Apple doesn’t believe in increasing megapixels. As we have seen iPhone 7 with just 12 MP cameras and is far better in quality as compared to its competitors. We have seen amazing dual lens camera with iPhone7+ and hoping something spectacular with upcoming flagship as well.. Expected Camera specs for iPhone 8:. This time company is going to take its camera features further to next level. have a 12 MP primary camera with upgraded f/1.7 aperture lens for better images even in low lights. The phone will support 4k recordings as well. Talking about its front camera, it will have a 7 MP camera f/2.2 for iPhone 8 and f/1.7 for iPhone 8+ with Autofocus, HDR, panorama, and face detection features. Also this time, Apple may bring Iris Eye scanner or face detection with it.. As per the latest leaks and rumors Apple iPhone 8 will have TSMC and ARM-based 10nm chip. We all know Apple brings a new processor every year with its flagship Smartphone. Apple iPhone 7 will run on A10 which is Quad Core processor. It will have 3GB RAM in the 5.1-inch model and 4GB RAM in iPhone8 Plus which is far enough to handle high-end multitasking with iOS.. Well, if you still not satisfied with above specifications and feature then you must see below to see why iPhone stands out of the race. Here we have some really innovative features and wish list that Apple iPhone 8 must have:. These are some expected features that are rumored for iPhone 8 and we know that Apple is the one who can accomplish these kinds of features.. Well, the speculating price of iPhone 8 is not going to be an easy job after these kinds of high-end specifications. But still, we think Apple will introduce iPhone8 and iPhone 8 Plus. with a price bracket of 1100. to 1200 USD which is quite affordable if you compare it to its features.. See: Apple iPhone 7 vs. Below you can see a country-wide price list of upcoming Apple iPhone 8 .. Update : In India Apple has recently set up an iPhone manufacturing unit which may result in lowering the price of upcoming Apple iPhone’s in India. As most of the parts are going to manufactured in-house. will be fewer customs and that result in cheaper iPhone’s in India.. Last year Apple has unveiled its iPhone 7 with IFA event (Sept. 2016) and this year Apple has recently announced iPhone 2017 flagship on Sept 12 and iPhone 8 will be available for pre-orders from Sept 15. However, the iPhone X variant will take a bit longer and will be available for pre-orders from Oct, 22.. So, as from the previous trend, we can say, that this year as well September will. be the best time for next iPhone release.. Why you should wait for next upgrade?. Well, we are not stopping you from getting a new iPhone. But still, you can consider it.. If currently, you are on iPhone 6S or older variant, waiting for iPhone8 is a better option. As Apple is going to bring some major changes in design and specs as well. But if you have an iPhone 7 then most likely you don’t need to upgrade. Even taking new features of iPhone8 , we still recommend you to hold on with iPhone 7 as its still able to perform all the task that iPhone8 will do.. So, we have to wait quite long from here to see the best iPhone ever. We would like to update you with more information of upcoming iPhone Smartphones soon..

Which is showing that screen is larger through a button .?. January 9, 2017 at 8:47 am. I think it’s the best phone I’ve ever read and saw it’s feature. I’m impressed with the features and technology being shown improved for a high-end phone. But what I need for improvement is perhaps it can be charged through solar because we have a lot of lights around us so we will not have a problem in searching for a female plug or outlet in case the current piss off. Another thing is more research on how to bring down the iPhone to about 30 meters under the seawater for about 8 hours without fail. Please do so in the future .. January 9, 2017 at 10:10 pm. I want to known will iPhone8 will have jet red color or not and when apple is planning to release it.. January 10, 2017 at 8:55 pm.

As we all know iPhone 7 and 7 Plus just out and available we don’t this is the time for iPhone 8 as Apple may not like to burn their $$$$$$$$ in vain. Launching iPhone 8 at MWC or in mid-2017 will surely harm iPhone 7, but as far as release date is concern they may launch it at late 2017, may be at IFA 2017 event. For India we think it may be available by October end but we recommend you to join our facebook or Google+ page for latest updates and rumours.. March 9, 2017 at 5:09 am. Whoever edits and pulbishes these articles really knows what they’re doing.. January 24, 2017 at 11:55 am.

Apple rivals are making their way to the sales top charts from past few months after the release of Samsung S8 and S8 Plus, which has been a huge talk in many countries and the sales chart are going crazy as the display is one of its kind. Meanwhile, Apple always releases their new edition in September or October, which is why everyone is waiting for the latest version of Apple iPhone.. On the top of that, the first iPhone. released in the year of 2007 and it’s been over ten years since the first iPhone hit the market and they made history. The Apple has released iPhone 8, 8 Plus and iPhone X.. A lot of users are going crazy, and many of them are confused over the edition names. We are going to remove their doubts.. This is iPhone 8 Plus (They both look similar, but the differences are in hardware). iPhone X is their flagship smartphone (Designed to rule the market and Samsung S8 edition). Let’s start things off with the iPhone X because Apple aim is to break the market records and keep the Samsung S-series at bay or that’s what Apple is having in their mind.. We are going to reveal if the iPhone X is worth your money or should you go for the iPhone 8 or Plus version, we will clear your doubts and the unveil the technology used in making the iPhone X.. Let’s first look at the hardware and how strong is it to run latest Apps and Games.. Processor: Apple A11 Bionic (They say this is the dominant Processor the iPhone ever had). RAM: 3GB RAM (Samsung Note 8 has 6GB RAM, and OnePlus 5 has 6GB RAM). Internal Storage: 64GB and 256GB variant. (Storage is not an issue on an iPhone). OS: iOS 11 (Its upgradeable to iOS 13 or so). Camera Rear: 12MP Dual camera with Quad-LED.. Battery: Not specified (However, iPhone’s main issue are battery capacity). Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen, 16M colors.. 1125 x 2436 pixels (~458 PPI pixel density), which is “ 5.8 Inches .”. Here are the important specifications you need to know about the iPhone X. Let’s talk about the things, which iPhone is selling it and their selling points of the smartphone.. Yes, Apple is selling the smartphone not based on the Specs but the Screen and things you can do with this sort of screen. Along with addition with texting service.. Apple has jumped on the latest trend this early because of the market demand and competition. The bezel-less smartphone era has started, and the start is coming from the iPhone X.. After the Essential Phone has released, it looks good that the Apple is taking the Bezelled phones seriously. The iPhone X comes with 5.8 inches screen which is meant for those who like to operate the smartphone with one hand.. The iPhone X is completely a different smartphone when you compare it to the iPhone 7 because the screen is wider and fuller than the previous generation. The ironic part is that Samsung S8 and iPhone X screen resolution are the same. You will enjoy the iPhone X if you have not tasted the Samsung S8 bezel-less screen.. The screen is Rich, Smooth, Trendy, and the aspect ratio is similar to the S8, which means you will experience the same as S8.. However, the home button is no longer available because the screen has taken all space, which is why you now have to swipe up to unlock. It will take a lot of time for the iPhone users to adjust to the change.. The screen resolution has been upgraded when compared to the previous generation iPhone 7, and you now have a resolution of 2436 x 1125 on the Retina HD display. The iPhone X has been upgraded to the point where it can match to the rivals and win against it. The screen is packed with more pixel count as now you can view the Apps, Videos, and Pictures in detail (better than before) and the web browsing will be better as well.. Unlike the previous generations had the LCD screen, which use to give us better view but the battery consumption is higher on that screen. The iPhone X comes with an OLED screen that is an upgrade, but we cannot tell whether the battery life has improved or not. The colours and the brightness are better than before.. The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 has been declared as the best display on the market but tables will turn as the iPhone X is bow using the same technology. We can’t tell much about it, but X model will have an impact on the market as well.. The overall mix of technology is great, and brings about a special-looking iPhone, rather than Apple rehashing the same tired design again.. Apple is making mistakes by launching weaker and same old design into the market because the loyal fans are always ready to purchase an iPhone. However, the Apple is falling a little by little every year, but there is hope now after the iPhone X release.. It’s weird but The Essential smartphone and the iPhone X have a front camera in the same position, and the technology is remarkably similar.. All of the sensors are available in front along with the camera. The well-designed smartphone does not have any cons when it comes to Front camera and sensors.. However, it does come with Pros and Cons, which you need to know about it.. Con: The smartphone does not come with a fingerprint scanner that is kind of weird for a smartphone of this age, but at the same time I think it is good not to have such feature.. Pro: The smartphone comes with a front camera that has face recognition that reads your face to unlock, or you can even use the traditional method “Power button” for unlocking.. Con: The iPhone X is extremely expensive. For 64Gb variant, you have to pay $1000 (Taxes are not included. ) Just imagine for those who are non-USA resident, they have to pay over $1700 for 256Gb variant. It is insane that you have to pay over $1700 for a smartphone. The Samsung S8 and Note 8 are much better choice than iPhone X.. Con: The latest User Interface is a hassle for many old Apple users. You cannot use one hand to use the smartphone. The navigation has become complicated, and entire UI has been altered to give the smartphone a new look. The latest interface includes Gestures and Swipes that will take a lot of time for you to master.. Con: We have another con for those who like to add Applecare and Insurance for the iPhone X, the cost has changed drastically. You have to $199 for the whole package, but last year it was only $129, which is far lesser than the iPhone X charges.. Every iPhone in the past has lacked one feature, and that is improving battery life, which is an issue for an iPhone 7 as well. The battery drains incredibly faster when you are watching movies or videos on Youtube on high brightness, but the Apple has made the X model charge wireless.. The iPhone x launch day, they not have mentioned anything about the battery capacity, how you can charge the wireless, and more. The wireless charger, how long does that take to charge and other aspects. There is nothing new about it because Wireless charger has been in existence since 2012, which was launched in Nexus 4 but now Samsung is leading the wireless charging market.. The ability to unlock just by looking at it, does this ring a bell to you? We are talking about the Touch ID, which has replaced with the Face ID. Its just matter of time whether it’s a hit or an another major-less by Apple.. Another bold move from Apple, it’s not like everyone is using it to unlock the smartphone. Not many people know, but you can unlock the face ID by the photograph of yours. It isn’t that difficult to unlock the smartphone by a photograph.. The Touch ID scans your finger and saves your touch id, in the same way, the face id will scan your face in different angles, hope it makes any sense. Apple has said that it is one of the safest ways to secure your smartphone.. The smartphone will only unlock when you look at it. According to the Apple, the sensor will focus on your eyes, when you look at the screen it unlocks.. What do we have this year from the iPhone? The way I look at it, it’s the same old iPhone, which is packed with some latest specifications. We are going to tell you everything you need to know about the iPhone 8.. Before we begin, let’s start things off with the specifications.. Let’s first look at the hardware and how strong is it to run latest Apps and Games.. Processor: Apple A11 Bionic (They say this is the dominant Processor the iPhone ever had). RAM: 2GB RAM (Samsung Note 8 has 6GB RAM, and OnePlus 5 has 6GB RAM). Internal Storage: 64GB and 256GB variant. (Storage is not an issue on an iPhone). OS: iOS 11 (Its upgradeable to iOS 13 or so). Hexa-core (2x Monsoon + 4x Mistral) and. Camera Rear: 12MP Dual camera with Quad-LED.. Battery: 1821 mAh battery capacity. Screen: LED-backlit IPS LCD, capacitive touchscreen, 16M colors.. Screen Resolution: 750 x 1334 pixels (~326 PPI pixel density), which is “ 4.7 Inches .”. Without wasting any further time, we are going to cover that part why you should upgrade to iPhone 8 over iPhone 7.. Apple always claims that their latest version is the best from the Apple.. The true tone feature allows the camera to understand the surroundings colour and balance the brightness. Of course, not many people were able to test the product in the launch because of the surroundings were not changing.. The market is shining with the latest screen, but it’s hard to tell whether there is any difference in the iPhone 7 and eight-screen. Not only that, most of the part, we can tell that there is no improvement in the screen part.. Apart from the internal hardware improvements, the iPhone packs with an amazing video quality with 4k recording with 60FPS. The previous version you can only record 4k video in 30FPs, which is an improvement.. In the early benchmarks, we were able to see the difference in the iPhone 7 and iPhone X performance after the processor upgrade. The Apple A11 bionic chipset has proven to be the faster than their previous generation. The iPhone 8 has the same processor, which is clocked the same. iPhone 8 and Plus version is new in the market and you will see the effects in the games and apps after few months of the official distribution or when the smartphone goes on sale. The GPU is upgraded so you won’t be able to see any glitches or any lags during the game even in the high-level setting.. The Portrait mode is enabled in the 8 and models, which is inspired from the X-model. We cannot say much about it until the comparison between 8 plus and X models are made.. The smartphones are packed with the wireless chargers, which means you will now be able to experience the wireless charging on the smartphone, but you cannot expect much from it until we test it from out and after the release.. It’s a good thing Apple went with the Qi standard. The company is known for adopting proprietary standards, but that would have been a nonstarter for the iPhone 8, as Qi charging pads are already the norm in many airports and coffee shops. Not being able to charge in these places would have defeated the purpose of wireless charging.. Apple has been following the iPhone 6 design because it is unique and something that defines Apple brand. It seems like they do not want to make significant changes early so that the loyal users can digest the latest design slowly.. After looking at the smartphone 8 and 8 Plus, there isn’t much difference in the both smartphone. They both resemblance to the previous generation. The design has minor changes, but it isn’t going to make much of the differences.. Everything goes down to is it even worth your money? The way we look at it, I don’t see much of the differences in upgrading to the iPhone 8 or 8 Plus. iPhone X is indeed an amazing smartphone, but the price of the 256GB (including taxes) can get you two Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone It’s not worth your money.. However, if you are an Apple user and want to experience the latest technology then iPhone X is the better choice but avoid iPhone 8 and 8 Plus because the both handsets are not the future.. Release date | Garageband For PC. A 1200 to 1600 price tag is too much for average user. I can’t see the internal or physical changes being made that justify these huge price increases..this may be the point of diminishing returns for Apple. Leave a Reply Cancel reply.

Remember all of these are handpicked information about iPhone 8 from the minimum access to the rumors we got.. iphone ８ to launch sooner than the previously speculated time period]. But before we indulge into discussing the iPhone 8 release date, specs and features let’s have a look at the history behind iPhone’s inception and its successful journey till date. Apple first launched this coveted series of handsets in 2007 when they launched the first generation iPhone on 29 th June. The first-gen iPhone was a GSM phone and only supported 2G. The first real revolution this line of smartphones witnessed in the iPhone 3G which came with the 3G cellular network capabilities and also featured Assisted GPS (A-GPS), a Geolocation API to locate the phone. The upgraded variant, the iPhone 3GS came packed with a higher-resolution camera capable of recording video at 480p and a faster processor.. The next iteration of this flagship series, iPhone 4 featured a high resolution 960×640 Retina Display, a 5-megapixel rear camera with 720p video capturing capability and a VGA front-facing camera for video calling. The iPhone 4S went through a camera upgradation, an 8-megapixel camera with 1080p video capturing facilities includes a dual-core A5 processor and introduced Siri, a natural language voice control system for the first time. The next generation handset, iPhone 5 comes with a dual-core A6 processor, introduces the LTE support for the first time (it will be available to iPhone 8 also FYI) as well as increases the size of the Retina display to 4 inches.. The iPhone 5S includes a dual-core 64-bit A7 processor, an updated camera with dual-LED flash and introduces the Touch ID fingerprint scanner. The US-based company further increased the display size in the next generation smartphone, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which comes with a 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches screen size respectively. Apart from that, these two devices also feature an A8 chip. The iPhone 7 is also expected to hit the market shelves very soon, and speculations are it will come with a staggering waterproof display. So from a GSM mobile phone to a smartphone with all most every modern day technicalities, iPhone surely have come a long way.. You can check our views on Concept design also- Apple iPhone 8 concept designs .. iPhone signifies a class and surely it will retain its tag in future also. iPhone 8 is going to be a breakthrough in smart telephony. From the leaks of iPhone 7 we already have got lots, of speculations and can imagine the device, iPhone 7 more or less. same thing we do for iPhone 8, we will have nothing but some ideas and imaginations. After accumulating as much as information, you better call these rumors of iPhone 8 , we drew an imaginary technical picture of the device. check out the best iPhone 8 case. As Apple will celebrate the 10 years anniversary of the iPhone series, they are going to come up something unique and innovative to mark this auspicious occasion. So the speculations are, the tech powerhouse is going to revamp the entire design of the handsets of this line. If we believe multiple rumors, the iPhone 8 is going to sport a curved display. The engineers of both Samsung and Apple are trying hard to decode the formula of this unbelievable technology, and if Apple could able to incorporate the curved display in the iPhone 8, they will get a huge lead over their rivals regarding uniqueness. As of now, the curved display is a distant dream, but it is just only a matter of time and who knows the device might come as the first smartphone to feature a curved display. Moreover, Apple may eliminate the home button too and replace it with the Touch ID as they are thinking to completely revamp the design of the iPhone 8.. Check the possible iPhone 8 display features- Apple iPhone 8 rumored display design and features .. As Apple is increasing the display size of their flagship smartphone with each new iteration, iPhone 8 is expected to flaunt a bigger screen size than the iPhone 7. It is speculated to come with a 4.7-inch screen. So the upcoming iPhone device might feature a 5.2-inch screen whereas the iPhone 8S will sport a 5.7-inch display.. No doubt, the iPhone 8 display will come with the utmost pixel resolution, most likely the 4K display with 4096 × 2160 pixel resolution and will be protected with the latest Corning Gorilla Glass technology. Samsung has already launched the Galaxy S7 with the latest Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection. By the time Apple will launch the iPhone 8 , Corning Gorilla Glass 5 will be unveiled, and the handset is expected to get protected by that. According to the company claim, the brand new Corning Gorilla Glass 5 raises the bar for protection against drops higher than ever and can withstand 1.6-meter, shoulder-height drops onto the rough, hard surfaces up to 80% of the time.. Fans have always complained about iPhone’s internal storage, as the company does not provide any microSD card option in their handsets. So the US-based tech giant may include a little more spaces into the handset this time. It is almost sure that iPhone will be launched in different variants depending on the internal storage of the device. The basic level model will feature 64GB of internal storage, while the upgraded variant may come with 128 GB internal storage and the premium model will offer the users 256GB of space with the iPhone 8.. Unlike the internal storage, there is no chance of complaining about the iPhone’s camera quality, as it is one of the bests, if not the best, in its league. The iPhone 6 comes with a 12-megapixel rear camera which is equivalent to a 20-megapixel camera of other smartphone making companies. As per the reports, the iPhone 8 may come with a 15-megapixel rear camera autofocus, optical image stabilization, and 4K-recording capabilities. Moreover, the primary shooter will also feature the upgraded ISOCELL sensors for clicking clear images even in the low lights. Not only that, the company may introduce the dual sensor technology for the first time to capture clear images of the moving bodies. It will also remove the noise while capturing video.. If we talk about the secondary camera, experts believe that iPhone 8 will come with a 6-megapixel front camera with autofocus and OIS technology for video chat and take selfies.. Camera is gonna feature more than you expected. A dual lens camera with the. optical zoom that means iPhone 8 can capture better photos than all Smartphone cameras. Instead of pinching to zoom (till now pinching display results zoom), this usually results in a terrible grainy photo.. Apple has enhanced camera functionalities for its flagship device i.e. iPhone 7 quite a lot, so we can easily guess that the iPhone 8 camera will be too good, and it would give quite a competition to the top level DSLRs available in the market as of then. iPhone 6, the current generation flagship is powered by company’s very own A8 processor. We all know that Apple unveils a new processor with its flagship smartphone every year. So if Apple maintains the same trend with iPhone 8, we are going to see the brand new A10 Quad Core processor comes packed with the handset. Moreover, the advanced 7 nano meter FinFET technology will also be included in this speculated next-gen processor. Many recent leaks and rumors are also supporting this theory. According to those, the iPhone 8 will be powered by a TSMC and ARM-based 7nm chipset. Apart from that, the handset is also expected to house with 4GB of RAM and should run on the iOS 11 operating system. So, coupled with a 4GB RAM and iOS 11 operating system, the iPhone 8 will be capable of handling high-end graphics and multitasking.. The iPhone 7 is most likely to come with a 2500mAh battery. But that will not be sufficient, considering the fact the usage of internet has increased rapidly as well as many apps and games have been launched which suck away the juice too much. So, it is sure that Apple will increase the battery capacity in iPhone 8. Now the question rises, how much they will increase? Well, our guess is the iPhone 8 will be powered by a 2800mAh battery which will be able to provide the users 18 hours of 4G usage. There is no question that the phone will support with the quick-charging technology. Even some reports have also claimed that iPhone 8 may come with a wireless charger ( portable charger ).. All the modern day sensor options will be available on the iPhone 8, including the accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, heart rate, SpO2 and Fingerprint. Now the question is whether it will come with the retina or iris tracking sensors or not. Many sources close to the project is claiming that iPHone 8 will flaunt the iris tracking sensors which will strengthen the phone’s security as well as will facilitate the users with the hands-free way of unlocking.. Beating arch rival Samsung, Apple will introduce an all new kind of water and dust proof display that will bear better screen resolution and scratch resistance characteristics. Samsung has already introduced side display in Galaxy S6. Apple may go a bit higher in iPhone 8 and can make both side displays.. At first, iPhone’s traditional LCD is gonna change and Apple may opt OLED display that consumes less power and provides better display quality. In display feature, resolution of the display may take a huge leap, and it may settle for a 4K display with ultra HD quality. Though Apple does not reveal anything about its Retina display, we can expect a superior display quality like Sony Xperia Z5 Premium. All these iPhone 8 rumors come from the supply chains of Apple.. If recent reports are to be believed, Apple may go for face scanning. for extra security on the iPhone 8 and ditch the fingerprint scanner. Simply put, this revamped security feature will use cutting edge technology to check the identity of the user who is accessing it. This 3D face scanning system will also be more secure than the normally used Touch ID on Apple’s flagship iPhones.. Besides providing access to the phones, the 3D face scanning feature will also enable log into the various apps and will also verify payments. Another great feature is the fact that it can be accessed at all angles, which essentially means that the user can unlock the device at face level as well as while the device is lying flat on a surface.. The 3D face scanning system is built around accuracy and speed of access. A few hundred milliseconds is all it takes for scanning the user’s face and unlocking the device. Also, since it involves 3D scanning, the device is able to distinguish between the user’s face and a photo of it and will respond. There are also reports that Apple will use eye-scanning. technology as well, which is currently found on the Samsung Galaxy S8. Both of these features will bolster the iPhone 8’s security features. The face-scanning technology, Apple states, is also more secure than the Touch ID technology, with a reported 1 in 50,000 chance of getting unlocked by another user’s finger. In the end, not only will we have a. device with wireless charging , we will also have a more secure one.. The World is heading for using more nonconventional power usage and as a premier tech company Apple may introduce their first in class solar charging plate integrated with iPhone 8. Wireless changing is a feature that has the maximum chance to get integrated into the device.. iPhone 8 Concept Design 3 (Credit: Steel Drake). An upgraded version of the FindMyPhone app is all we are expecting in the iPhone 8, and the makers are surely working on that. Apart from that, a remote assistance app may also be introduced in the handset where the users can access their phone’s data from their PC through a secured channel and can moderate or delete information whenever they want.. Once you have protected the phone from thieves now, it’s time to protect from a sudden drop or hand slip. Apple iPhone 8 is gonna attached with edge bumper which protects the screen while dropped on the floor.. Better sound quality comes with better speakers and Apple finally focused on this and a frontend speaker is expected to come with quality stereo sound. Playing games and streaming video are gonna be more entertaining. Apple is developing wireless headphones for ultimate entertainment as they are ditching 3.5 mm jack.. Great connectivity options provide ample sources to unleash the true power of iPhone. iPhone 8 will be accompanied with lightning port instead of traditional 3.5 mm jack which ultimately results from more room for additional attachments. We are expecting the second lens there.. There are strong speculations going on that iPhone 7 will ditch the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack and will replace it with the brand new Lightning port technology. The benefit of using the technology is the audio quality does not get hampered with a lightning port, and it is more modern day approach. So chances are very that Apple will repeat the same technology in the iPhone 8 too unless any disaster happens and get many e-mails from their fans.. The iPhone 7 comes with a lightning port, ditching the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack. Although the introduction of this new age technology was welcomed whole heartedly by the fans, it has its own downsides too. As the conventional 3.5mm headset jack is gone, the users need to buy the AirPods separterly, which was unveiled along with the iPhone 7 and perfectly compatible with the handset.. Available on the Apple Store, the AirPods cost around £160 or $206 and link up to your iPhone or Apple Watch via Bluetooth. But Apple believes the fact spending another £160 to just listen to music might detract many potential buyers. So according to the latest report, the Cupertino-based tech conglomerate has decided to ship the iPhone 8 with the AirPods, so that more customers get lured to the device.. The wireless Airpods come with various sensors which automatically detect when they are plugged in the user’s ears, and play or pause the music accordingly. Apart from that, the device also features a microphone which let Siri to control your music, adjust the volume and check your battery life without taking out the handset from the user’s pocket.. Another feature which we are most likely to experience in the iPhone 7 is the water resistant display. Even the latest rumor is that the Apple Inc. is developing some of the gorgeous iPhone 7 Cases this time, and such cases will be available for free of cost if you purchase iPhone 7 within 30 days of its launch. Samsung has already launched their flagship Galaxy S7 with this technology and thus how can Apple leave behind. With this technology, the handset will be water resistant for more than 1.5 meter and 30 minutes and will also meet the IP68 certification criteria. iPhone 8, again is more likely to retain this technology too, and will also be dustproof.. To enhance the audio quality, Apple may introduce a second speaker in the front end of the iPhone 8. The speaker is also expected to come with stereo quality sound. Apple may also introduce a wireless headphone with the iPhone 7 which will be retained in the next iteration too.. If we take historical precedents, we will see that the talismanic iPhones launch every September. It was anticipated that the new iPhone 8, the tenth-generation iPhone, would also follow the same pattern. However, Apple is having some serious issues with the supply chain of the OLED display panels which will be on board the biggest of this year’s Apple mobile devices. This year, three models are expected to release: a 4.7-inch LCD version, a 5.5-inch LCD. version, besides a 5.8-inch edge-to-edge OLED version. The new iPhone 8 will also have a ton of other. Apple’s OLED panels are facing a serious supply chain bottleneck, which may end up delaying the devices in the end. Our best guess is that while the devices will start shipping in September, the initial supplies will be very limited. This last bit was stated by. Morgan, noted analysts, who have often been proven right about such technical issues, mixed with business ones. is a slightly dicey affair, at the moment.. Morgan refers to the iPhone 8 as the iPhone Pro, however. In the end, we believe that while the September release date and the October sales window will be met, the quantities will be limited. This might lead to some problems in Apple’s product lifecycle as well.. iPhone 7 is expected to hit the market shelves with a hefty price tag of $1099 to $1499 depending on the variants and the colors. So, our guess is iPhone 8 will also fall under the same price range. According to the experts, iPhone 8 will be priced at $1200 for the basic level model and $1500 for the premium level variant.. All these specifications and features of iPhone 8 are collected from various sources and studying all the steps of Apple Inc like what they have submitted for patent, vendors they have given contracts, etc. It may feature something more interesting. We will keep updating about all new features as we will get any ray of new iPhone 8 rumor .. With some real awesome features and cool curved slim design, Apple iPhone 8 is coming to dominate the heart and souls of all iPhone lover. Be Prepared for this tech show! this beast is best valentines gifts for her.

New Year, New iPhone Could Be The Norm. Would OLED Be A Standard Or Premium Feature?. As usual, everyone's talking about the rumored new iPhone. The wrinkle? They're not talking about the very next model, the iPhone 7 due out in September, but instead are looking out. a distant 15 months or so ahead -- a lifetime in the tech world -- at the following iPhone.. Next year's iPhone 8 is shaping up to be the most exciting smartphone release from Apple ( AAPL ) since the original iPhone in 2007.. And for Apple that's good -- and bad.. The buzz around the 2017 model iPhone is so great that it threatens to put a damper on sales of this year's model, analysts say.. The iPhone 8 has been written about extensively in the tech and mainstream media, with journalists and analysts getting their information from leaks in the supply chain.. "As more and more is written about the iPhone 8, the average consumer will start to become aware of what's coming from Apple," Canaccord Genuity analyst Mike Walkley told IBD.. People who have paid off their current iPhones "might wait one more year for what they think is going to be a bigger release," timed with the 10-year anniversary of the first iPhone, Walkley. "Certainly everything in the supply chain points to next year having a much more differentiated device than this next one.". Apple observers expect the iPhone 7 will be a relatively minor upgrade to the current iPhone 6S series handsets. The 7 is expected to be thinner, faster and have a better camera, but nothing too earthshaking is seen. It will look pretty much like any iPhone from the past couple of years.. By contrast, the iPhone 8 could sport a radical redesign thanks to its use of an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen, instead of the current LCD screen.. The iPhone 8 could make Apple's smartphone sexy again and prompt long lines to form outside Apple retail stores, like in the good old days.. But rumors about the 8, which will be the 11th-generation iPhone, could inspire people to extend the life of their existing handsets and wait to upgrade, Wall Street analysts say. That could lead to soft sales of this fall's 10th-generation handset, the iPhone 7. And those soft sales would be on top of weaker-than-expected sales of the current iPhone 6S.. One huge factor could alleviate much of this concern, though -- the way service providers are altering their business models.. Apple and its carrier partners such as AT&T ( T ) and Verizon Communications ( VZ ) probably will use the iPhone 7 launch to promote upgrade plans that let customers get new iPhones every year, says Tim Bajarin,. an analyst with Creative Strategies and a longtime Apple watcher.. "More and more people are going to move to that, because everybody knows that Apple does a better phone every year," he said.. Most of the excitement over the iPhone 8 concerns its rumored use of an edgeless OLED screen. OLED displays boast richer colors, deeper blacks and a faster refresh rate than LCD screens. Since OLED screens don't have a backlight, they can be much thinner and more power efficient. Plus, OLED displays are flexible, allowing them to be used on curved screens.. Mock-ups of possible iPhone 8 designs circulated by tech enthusiast websites illustrate dramatic new form factors for the device. From iPhones with secondary screens along their sides to all-glass handsets in which the display covers the entire surface of the phone, front and back.. For years, Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive has expressed a desire for the iPhone to appear like a single sheet of glass, the Wall Street Journal reported recently.. But don't put a lot of stock into those artists' conceptions of the iPhone 8, Bajarin says.. "The kinds of designs you're seeing now are more pie-in-the-sky than reality," he said.. The iPhone 8 could be so fresh-looking that it could cause new-model envy among current iPhone users, something that hasn't happened since Apple moved to larger screen sizes in 2014.. One big question is whether Apple will limit the OLED-screen iPhone 8 to a premium model and keep selling LCD models as well.. Another is whether any use of a curved display or wraparound screen will be truly useful or perceived as a gimmick.. Apple's OLED iPhone wouldn't be the first such smartphone on the market. Samsung already uses OLED displays in its flagship Galaxy smartphones. Samsung itself, in fact, is the top maker of OLED displays, including for its TV sets, and Apple likely would have to buy its OLED screens from Samsung until other vendors could ramp up production.. Sharp, Japan Display, Joled, AU Optronics ( AUO ) and LG Display ( LPL ) all plan to add either pilot or production capacity for OLED screens in 2017 or 2018. Plus, at least five Chinese companies are preparing OLED production lines.. Apple enthusiasts, however, will think the OLED iPhone is a "big deal," even though Samsung and others already use them, says Roger Kay, an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates and another longtime Apple watcher.. Roughly 10% of smartphones use OLED displays today, and that figure could reach 100% after 2020, Goldman Sachs said in a May 23 research report.. But the OLED screen could be just one selling point of the iPhone 8. Another major change is that next year's iPhone could feature wireless charging, according to media reports. Instead of plugging in a power cord, users would place the device on a charging mat. Again, Samsung and some others, such as Motorola, already offer such a feature, but it would be another big change for the iPhone.. In addition, Apple also could eliminate the physical home button with the iPhone 8. That functionality would be incorporated into the pressure-sensitive touch screen. Removing the home button would allow the display to cover more of the iPhone's front panel.. For the iPhone 7, Apple is expected to eliminate the audio jack, forcing users to switch to a Bluetooth headset or a Lightning-connected headset.. A rumor circulating at the Computex Taipei 2016 trade show claims that, with the iPhone 7, Apple plans to bundle a Lightning adapter with its standard EarPods headphones.. With the removal of the audio jack in the iPhone 7 and wireless charging in the iPhone 8, Apple could then offer a smartphone with no holes to plug in chargers and cables. The device could be completely wire free and rely on the internet cloud for data backup..

Apple iPhone 8 Release Date, Features and Price. Apple iPhone 8 release date, Price, Specs and Features discussion about iPhone 8G predictions and rumors, apparently seems to be a far future debate. Apple itself as a company might be unsure about iPhone 7 , iPhone 6 or iPhone 5S release dates. But its investors, analysts, fans and followers are sure not going to rest for the rest of their life :). Apple iPhone 8th Generation is already under discussion from social media like Facebook and Youtube to technology forums like MacRumors and AppleInsider. Albert Einstein said, "Imagination is Powerful than Intelligence". Steve Jobs was one of those capable of visioning what is invisible to others, conceive future technology ideas like iPhone 7G and iPhone 8G to create marvels from divine imagination, innovation and creativity. He was the one who knows what humans want before they want. Steve Jobs must have already been working on the ideas of future iPhone generations for the fact that Apple like all other technology companies, works on a 5 years advance Research and Development road-map, followed by the actual iPhone products life-cycle in the market. Despite Jobs herculean enthusiasm to create an iPhone Prototype Model with a next generation magical user interface beyond Siri, he would have realized there was only one place where he could see his amazing idea in action: heaven or in his case iHeaven. For in heaven, as you think, so you create. If Jobs thinks of the next iPhone, the next iPhone appears in his hand in the extraordinary dimensions he would dream, the incredible features, the beautiful color and the most phenomenal user interface that would be the holy grail for smartphones. After the departure of Apple's legendary CEO, Tim Cook took the charge, with a lot of Apple investors, user and fans, curious to know about the future road-map of the organization. Its natural for some of the iPhone fans to start getting interested to know about upcoming Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 generations. The problem is, Apple has not revealed any information or road-map towards future iPhones so far and there is very few information available at the moment, on coming iPhone generations. Still, without going into fantasies and by staying realistic and sensible, iTechWhiz has tried to bring you some information on the topic, which we hope will serve the purpose as basic food for thoughts. Apple iPhone 8 Release Date If we have a look at Apple iPhone product life cycle and release schedule history, an Apple iPhone 8 Release date is expected in last quarter of 2015, exactly three years after the iPhone 5 release date, which was launched in October 2012. Apple iPhone 8 Features and Specs It is really hard to guess what kind of features iPhone 8 will have as we don’t know what kind of technology Apple will develop and apply in 2 years from now. But one thing is for sure that iPhone 8 is going to be better then iPhone 4, 5, and 6. Apple keeps on improving it’s products by bringing latest technology and innovation. You are definitely welcome to add a few of yours. But here are some areas where we think, constantly and continuously improved features and specifications by Apple are inevitable:. iPhone 8 Next Generation Technology With the use of latest technology Apple iPhone 8 would be most advance iPhone ever launched. Next generation smartphone processors, display screens and other technology component will make Apple iPhone 8 features much more enjoyable to the users. There would be Better Signal and recording audio quality, Improved Retina Display, a less glitching FaceTime over 4G in Apple iPhone 8. Better Display Screen You can surely expect screen of Apple iPhone 8 to be much better then iPhone Retina Display, as we know it today. Apple is working on next generation display technology that is be bendable and flexible. The company is evaluating and researching a number of patents in this account, including one of Flexible OLED display. iPhone 8 powered by A9 Processor and 4GB memory Apple iPhone 8 will also feature a powerful A9 processing chip, more powerful than 8-core processors, supported by 4Gb RAM to guarantee higher levels of multitasking at higher speeds. iPhone 8G with 512GB model iPhone 8G is expected to be available in models with 256GB and 512GB storage capacity. Increase in storage will enable iPhone 8th generation to provide enough space to increased disk demand by new iOS 10 operating system software. Larger storage will also allow more storage of HD videos, photos and music. Next Gen iPhone with 32MP Camera Apple iPhone is rumored to feature a 32 MP rear camera with 1080 pixel HD video recording and a next generation Apple. Current generation of iPhone packs 8 mega pixel rear cameras. Additional features in this camera are sure to be a must to ensure it is able to shrug off competition from already released products. iPhone 8 specs also include an 8MP front facing camera. Apple iPhone 8 with 5G With the release of any new Apple device new features and functions has always been the end result and this is sure to be with iPhone 8. Apple iPhone 8 is sure to include the 5G network both on AT&T and Spirit networks. iPhone 8 File Transfer File sharing is another patent that Apple has recently filed, it is unique and one of a kind as it involves physical motion pouring or flicking so as to transfer files and information between any iOS devices. This will make it possible for iPhone 8 to copy a file from an iPhone 8 to other iPhone or iPads by simply making a pouring motion with the phone. Flicking of files to people near you will also be a possible. iPhone Wireless Charging Support Wireless charging is another feature that is making lots of airwaves in the tech world of which iPhone 8 will surely feature. Wireless charging works by electromagnets charging the battery without any plugging from the source of power. iPhone hybrid battery In 2015-2016 when the next generation iPhone 8 is released, there will not be any need to charge it in the conventional way we do now days. Steve Jobs had already figured out in his life, rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries are not an efficient source of power. He was thinking on the concepts of an iPhone 8 with renewable energy. Solar cells printed on paper and sensors that store kinetic energy for an Apple-patented renewable energy charging feature were his candidate ideas. So the future iPhone 8 is going to have one of these energy sources or may be a hybrid of both. Apple iOS 10 with More Applications iPhone 8 will run on new Apple iOS 10 operating software rumored, running on powerful A9 processors and 4GB RAM, to ensure the device is able to carry out various activities with utmost speeds and reliability. iPhone 8 with JIRI, the next generation SIRI Jiri will be the next generation Siri in iOS9/10, which is technological transition from GUI and VUI to MUI. Apple SIRI, introduced with iPhone 4S Siri was the first effective Voice User Interface (VUI), a paradigm shift usability transformation from typical touch based Graphical User Interface (GUI). But the next generation usability is to bridge the remaining distance to the mind, with a Mind User Interface (MUI). Jiri is the technology that combined with Apple iGlass and iWatch has potential to beat Augmented Reality based Google Glass with huge margin. With the pace where technology is evolving so rapidly, there no reason an device could not be invented with a revolutionary MUI. Our thoughts would control the super-responsive virtual assistant embedded within the exciting iPhone 8. If you thought “What can I get my wife for her anniversary present?”, JIRI (Jobs Intuitive Recognition Interface) would immediately offer suggestions like Tiffany jewelry, a romantic restaurant and flowers delivered based on your last buying patterns and the data mining results of your spouse’s profile. Have you heard that in Heaven all your wishes will come true as soon as you think in mind. This is the "Jiri", an ultimate UI idea from the Steve Jobs concepts of iHeaven. Green iPhone 8 Technology iPhone 8 will be a for sure greener solution. The time, cost and energy it will save by eliminating the need for you to go window shopping from store to store or buying a special gift at the 11th hour. The elegant MUI will enable you to save fuel, reduce carbon emissions and eliminate waste in innumerable ways. iPhone 8G Price Estimation Apple is the company know to keep its cards close to the chest, therefore here are no official words on iPhone 8 Price or release schedule so far, and we expected them to keep their lips sealed till the 11th hour. However, financial costing analysts and retailers estimate iPhone 8 price tag to go range from $599 to $899 in United States, depending upon the storage model..

Nissan Takes A Leaf From GM With This Self-Driving Test. Stocks Up; Will Defense Stocks Crush The Market Indexes In 2018?. Intel, Tech Stocks Lead Dow; Is Apple Setting Up New Buy Point?. Apple will revamp its iPhone lineup in 2017, according to a new note by. Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI Securities, according to various reports.. The 2017 smartphone will have a curved glass body, similar to the iPhone 4/4s "flat sandwich" design, Kuo said, AppleInsider reported .. But instead of flat glass it will likely have curved glass front and back. The 5.8" iPhone -- presumably the iPhone 8 -- will use AMOLED displays. While there have been widespread rumors that Apple would turn to OLED displays, Kuo had previously predicted that they wouldn't be used until after 2017.. displays are thinner and more power-efficient than liquid crystal displays. They also have higher color saturation and are more flexible than LCDs. Alphabet ( GOOGL ) Google Nexus and the upcoming HP Inc. also will use some form of wireless charging , 9To5 Mac said, citing Kuo's note.

They run Apple's iOS mobile operating system. The first-generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, and there have been multiple new hardware iterations with new iOS releases since.. The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. The iPhone has Wi-Fi and can connect to cellular networks. An iPhone can shoot video (though this was not a standard feature until the iPhone 3GS ), take photos , play music , send and receive email , browse the web , send and receive text messages , follow GPS navigation , record notes, perform mathematical calculations, and receive visual voicemail. Other functionality, such as video games, reference works, and social networking, can be enabled by downloading mobile apps. 2017 [update] , Apple's App Store contained more than 2.2. million applications available for the iPhone.. Apple has released eleven generations of iPhone models, each accompanied by one of the eleven major releases of the iOS operating system. The original first-generation iPhone was a GSM phone and established design precedents, such as a button placement that has persisted throughout all releases and a screen size maintained for the next four iterations. The iPhone 3G added 3G network support, and was followed by the 3GS with improved hardware, the 4 with a metal chassis, higher display resolution and front-facing camera, and the 4S with improved hardware and the voice assistant Siri. The iPhone 5 featured a taller, 4-inch display and Apple's newly introduced Lightning connector. In 2013, Apple released the 5S with improved hardware and a fingerprint reader , and the lower-cost 5C , a version of the 5 with colored plastic casings instead of metal. They were followed by the larger iPhone 6 , with models featuring 4.7 and 5.5-inch displays. The iPhone 6S was introduced the following year, which featured hardware upgrades and support for pressure-sensitive touch inputs , as well as the SE —which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S. In 2016, Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus , which add water resistance, improved system and graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5. mm headphone jack found on previous models. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were released in 2017, adding a glass back and an improved screen and camera. The iPhone X was released alongside the 8 and 8 Plus, with its highlights being a near bezel-less design, an improved camera and a new facial recognition system, named Face ID , but having no home button, and therefore, no Touch ID .. The original iPhone was described as "revolutionary" and a "game-changer" for the mobile phone industry. Newer iterations have also garnered praise, and the iPhone's success has been credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies.. 1 History and availability. 1.1 Sales and profits. 1.2 iPhone Upgrade Program. 3.1 Screen and input. 3.2.2 Ambient light sensor. 3.2.9 Facial recognition sensor. 3.3 Audio and output. 3.8 Liquid contact indicators. 4.6 Email and text messages. 10 Encryption and intelligence agency access. 11.2 Unapproved third-party software and jailbreaking. 11.3.3 Australia and other countries. 12 Legal battles over brand name. Main article: History of iPhone. See also: List of iOS devices. Development of what was to become the iPhone began in 2004, when Apple started to gather a team of 1,000 employees to work on the highly confidential "Project Purple", [15] including Jonathan Ive , the designer behind the iMac and iPod. [16] Apple CEO Steve Jobs steered the original focus away from a tablet (which Apple eventually revisited in the form of the iPad ) and towards a phone. [17] Apple created the device during a secretive collaboration with Cingular Wireless (which became AT&T Mobility ) at the time—at an estimated development cost of US$150. According to Steve Jobs, the "i" word in "iMac" (and therefore "iPod", "iPhone" and "iPad") stands for internet, individual, instruct, inform and inspire. Apple rejected the " design by committee " approach that had yielded the Motorola ROKR E1 , a largely unsuccessful collaboration with Motorola. Among other deficiencies, the ROKR E1's firmware limited storage to only 100 iTunes songs to avoid competing with Apple's iPod nano. Cingular gave Apple the liberty to develop the iPhone's hardware and software in-house [23] [24] and even paid Apple a fraction of its monthly service revenue (until the iPhone 3G), [25] in exchange for four years of exclusive US sales, until 2011. Jobs unveiled the iPhone to the public on January 9, 2007, at the Macworld 2007 convention at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. [27] The two initial models, a 4. GB model priced at US$499 and an 8. GB model at US$599 (both requiring a two-year contract), went on sale in the United States on June 29, 2007, at 6:00. pm local time, while hundreds of customers lined up outside the stores nationwide. [28] The passionate reaction to the launch of the iPhone resulted in sections of the media dubbing it the 'Jesus phone'. [29] [30] Following this successful release in the US, the first generation iPhone was made available in the UK, France, and Germany in November 2007, and Ireland and Austria in the spring of 2008.. iPhone available since its original release. iPhone available since the release of iPhone 3G. On July 11, 2008, Apple released the iPhone 3G in twenty-two countries, including the original six. [31] Apple released the iPhone 3G in upwards of eighty countries and territories. [32] Apple announced the iPhone 3GS on June 8, 2009, along with plans to release it later in June, July, and August, starting with the US, Canada and major European countries on June 19. Many would-be users objected to the iPhone's cost, [33] and 40% of users had household incomes over US$100,000. The back of the original first generation iPhone was made of aluminum with a black plastic accent. The iPhone 3G and 3GS feature a full plastic back to increase the strength of the GSM signal. [35] The iPhone 3G was available in an 8. GB black model, or a black or white option for the 16. The iPhone 3GS was available in both colors, regardless of storage capacity.. The iPhone 4 has an aluminosilicate glass front and back with a stainless steel edge that serves as the antennas. It was at first available in black; the white version was announced, but not released until April 2011, 10 months later.. Users of the iPhone 4 reported dropped/disconnected telephone calls when holding their phones in a certain way. This became known as antennagate. On January 11, 2011, Verizon announced during a media event that it had reached an agreement with Apple and would begin selling a CDMA iPhone 4. Verizon said it would be available for pre-order on February 3, with a release set for February 10. [37] [38] In February 2011, the Verizon iPhone accounted for 4.5% of all iPhone ad impressions in the US on Millennial Media's mobile ad network. From 2007 to 2011, Apple spent $647. million on advertising for the iPhone in the US. On Tuesday, September 27, Apple sent invitations for a press event to be held October 4, 2011, at 10:00. am at the Cupertino Headquarters to announce details of the next generation iPhone, which turned out to be iPhone 4S. million 4S models were sold in the first 24 hours after its release in October 2011. [40] Due to large volumes of the iPhone being manufactured and its high selling price, Apple became the largest mobile handset vendor in the world by revenue, in 2011, surpassing long-time leader Nokia. [41] American carrier C Spire Wireless announced that it would be carrying the iPhone 4S on October 19, 2011. In January 2012, Apple reported its best quarterly earnings ever, with 53% of its revenue coming from the sale of 37. million iPhones, at an average selling price of nearly $660. The average selling price has remained fairly constant for most of the phone's lifespan, hovering between $622 and $660. [43] The production price of the iPhone 4S was estimated by IHS iSuppli , in October 2011, to be $188, $207 and $245, for the 16. [44] Labor costs are estimated at between $12.50 and $30 per unit, with workers on the iPhone assembly line making $1.78 an hour. In February 2012, ComScore reported that 12.4% of US mobile subscribers used an iPhone. million iPhones are active in the US alone. On September 12, 2012, Apple announced the iPhone 5. It has a 4-inch display, up from its predecessors' 3.5-inch screen. The device comes with the same 326 pixels per inch found in the iPhone 4 and 4S. The iPhone 5 has the SoC A6 processor, the chip is 22% smaller than the iPhone 4S' A5 and is twice as fast, doubling the graphics performance of its predecessor. The device is 18% thinner than the iPhone 4S, measuring 7.6 millimetres (0.3. in), and is 20% lighter at 112 grams (4. On July 6, 2013, it was reported that Apple was in talks with Korean mobile carrier SK Telecom to release the next generation iPhone with LTE Advanced technology. On July 22, 2013, the company's suppliers said that Apple is testing out larger screens for the iPhone and iPad. "Apple has asked for prototype smartphone screens larger than four inches and has also asked for screen designs for a new tablet device measuring slightly less than 13 inches diagonally, they said." [48]. On September 10, 2013, Apple unveiled two new iPhone models during a highly anticipated press event in Cupertino. The iPhone 5C, a mid-range-priced version of the handset that is designed to increase accessibility due to its price is available in five colors (green, blue, yellow, pink, and white) and is made of plastic. The iPhone 5S comes in three colors (black, white, and gold) and the home button is replaced with a fingerprint scanner (Touch ID). Both phones shipped on September 20, 2013. On September 9, 2014, Apple revealed the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus at an event in Cupertino. Both devices had a larger screen than their predecessor, at 4.7 and 5.5 inches respectively. In 2016, Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus , which add water and dust resistance, improved system and graphics performance, a new dual-camera setup on the Plus model, new color options, and remove the 3.5. On September 12, 2017, Apple officially unveiled the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which features a new glass design, camera improvements, a True Tone display, wireless charging and improved system performance. It also unveiled the iPhone X, which features a near-bezelless design, face recognition dubbed "Face ID" with facial tracking used for Animojis, an OLED screen with the highest pixel density on an iPhone, a new telephoto lens which works better in low light conditions, and improved cameras for AR. million first generation iPhone units over five quarters. [53] Sales in the fourth quarter of 2008, temporarily surpassed those of Research In Motion 's (RIM) BlackBerry sales of 5.2. million units, which briefly made Apple the third largest mobile phone manufacturer by revenue, after Nokia and Samsung [54] (However, some of this income is deferred [55] ). Recorded sales grew steadily thereafter, and by the end of fiscal year 2010, a total of 73.5. By 2010, the iPhone had a market share of barely 4% of all cellphones; however, Apple pulled in more than 50% of the total profit that global cellphone sales generate. [57] Apple sold 14.1 million iPhones in the third quarter of 2010, representing a 91% unit growth over the year-ago quarter, which was well ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 64% growth for the global smartphone market in the September quarter. Apple's sales surpassed that of Research in Motion 's 12.1 million BlackBerry units sold in their most recent quarter ended August 2010. [58] In the United States market alone for the third quarter of 2010, while there were 9.1 million Android-powered smartphones shipped for 43.6% of the market, Apple iOS was the number two phone operating system with 26.2% but the 5.5 million iPhones sold made it the most popular single device. On March 2, 2011, at the iPad 2 launch event, Apple announced that they had sold 100. [60] As a result of the success of the iPhone sales volume and high selling price, headlined by the iPhone 4S , Apple became the largest mobile handset vendor in the world by revenue in 2011, surpassing long-time leader Nokia. [41] While the Samsung Galaxy S II proved more popular than the iPhone 4S in parts of Europe, the iPhone 4S was dominant in the United States. In January 2012, Apple reported its best quarterly earnings ever, with 53% of its revenue coming from the sale of 37. million iPhones, at an average selling price of nearly $660. The average selling price has remained fairly constant for most of the phone's lifespan, hovering between $622 and $660. For the eight largest phone manufacturers in Q1 2012, according to Horace Dediu at Asymco, Apple and Samsung combined to take 99% of industry profits (HTC took the remaining 1%, while RIM, LG, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, and Nokia all suffered losses), with Apple earning 73 cents out of every dollar earned by the phone makers. As the industry profits grew from $5.3 billion in the first quarter of 2010 to $14.4 billion in the first quarter of 2012 (quadruple the profits in 2007), [62] [63] Apple had managed to increase its share of these profits. This is due to increasing carrier subsidies and the high selling prices of the iPhone, which had a negative effect on the wireless carriers (AT&T Mobility, Verizon, and Sprint) who have seen their EBITDA service margins drop as they sold an increasing number of iPhones. [64] [65] [66] By the quarter ended March 31, 2012, Apple's sales from the iPhone alone (at $22.7 billion) exceeded the total of Microsoft from all of its businesses ($17.4 billion). In the fourth quarter of 2012, the iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S were the best-selling handsets with sales of 27.4 million (13% of smartphones worldwide) and 17.4 million units, respectively, with the Samsung Galaxy S. III in third with 15.4 million. According to Strategy Analytics' data, this was "an impressive performance, given the iPhone portfolio's premium pricing," adding that the Galaxy S. III's global popularity "appears to have peaked" (the Galaxy S. III was touted as an iPhone-killer by some in the press when it was released [68] [69] ). While Samsung has led in worldwide sales of smartphones, Apple's iPhone line has still managed to top Samsung's smartphone offerings in the United States, [70] with 21.4% share and 37.8% in that market, respectively. iOS grew 3.5% to a 37.8%, while Android slid 1.3% to fall to a 52.3% share. The continued top popularity of the iPhone despite growing Android competition was also attributed to Apple being able to deliver iOS updates over the air, while Android updates are frequently impeded by carrier testing requirements and hardware tailoring, forcing consumers to purchase a new Android smartphone to get the latest version of that OS. [72] However, by 2013, Apple's market share had fallen to 13.1%, due to the surging popularity of the Android offerings. Apple announced on September 1, 2013, that its iPhone trade-in program would be implemented at all of its 250 specialty stores in the US. For the program to become available, customers must have a valid contract and must purchase a new phone, rather than simply receive credit to be used at a later date. A significant part of the program's goal is to increase the number of customers who purchase iPhones at Apple stores rather than carrier stores. On September 20, 2013, the sales date of the iPhone 5S and 5C models, the longest ever queue was observed at the New York City flagship Apple store, in addition to prominent queues in San Francisco, US and Canada; however, locations throughout the world were identified for the anticipation of corresponding consumers. [75] Apple also increased production of the gold-colored iPhone 5S by an additional one-third due to the particularly strong demand that emerged. [76] Apple had decided to introduce a gold model after finding that gold was seen as a popular sign of a luxury product among Chinese customers. Apple released its opening weekend sales results for the 5C and 5S models, showing an all-time high for the product's sales figures, with nine. million handsets sold—the previous record was set in 2012, when five. million handsets were sold during the opening weekend of the 5 model. This was the first time that Apple has simultaneously launched two models and the inclusion of China in the list of markets contributed to the record sales result. [78] Apple also announced that, as of September 23, 2013, 200 million devices were running the iOS 7 update, making it the "fastest software upgrade in history." [79]. An Apple Store located at the Christiana Mall in Newark, Delaware , US claimed the highest iPhones sales figures in November 2013. The store's high sales results are due to the absence of a sales tax in the state of Delaware. The finalization of a deal between Apple and China Mobile, the world's largest mobile network, was announced in late December 2013. The multi-year agreement provides iPhone access to over 760 million China Mobile subscribers. In the first quarter of 2014, Apple reported that it had sold 51. million iPhones, an all-time quarterly record, compared to 47.8. The iPhone Upgrade Program is a 24-month program designed for consumers to be able to get the latest iPhone every year, without paying the whole price up-front. The program consists of "low monthly payments", where consumers will gradually pay for the iPhone they have over a 24-month period, with an opportunity to switch (upgrade) to the new iPhone after 12 months of payment have passed. Once 12 months have passed, consumers can trade their current iPhone with a new one, and the payments are transferred from the old device to the new device, and the program "restarts" with a new 24-month period. Additional features of the program include unlocked handsets, which means consumers are free to pick the network carrier they want, and two-year AppleCare+ protection, which includes "hardware repairs, software support, and coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage". Criticism of the program includes the potential endless cycle of payments, with The Huffington Post ' s Damon Beres writing, "Complete the full 24-month payment cycle, and you're stuck with an outdated phone. Upgrade every 12 months, and you'll never stop owing Apple money for iPhones". Additionally, the program is limited to just the iPhone hardware; cell phone service from a network operator is not included. Before the release of the iPhone, handset manufacturers such as Nokia and Motorola were enjoying record sales of cell phones based more on fashion and brand rather than technological innovation. [87] The smartphone market, dominated at the time by BlackBerry OS and Windows Mobile devices, was a "staid, corporate-led smartphone paradigm" focused on enterprise needs. Phones at the time were designed around carrier and business limits which were conservative with regards to bandwidth usage and battery life. [88] [89] Phones were sold in a very large number of models, often segmented by marketing strategy, confusing customers and sapping engineering resources. [90] [91] For example, phones marketed at business were often deliberately stripped of cameras or the ability to play music and games. [92] Apple's approach was to deliberately simplify its product line by offering just one model a year for all customers, while making it an expensive, high-end product.. Apple's marketing, developing from the success of iPod campaigns, allowed the phone to become a mass-market product with many buyers on launch day. Some market research has found that, unusually for a technology product, iPhone users are disproportionately female. [93] Ars Technica noted in 2012 that Apple had avoided 'patronizing' marketing to female customers, a practice used (often to sell low-quality, high-priced products) by many of its competitors. When then-CEO of Research in Motion Mike Lazaridis pried open an iPhone, his impression was of a Mac stuffed into a cellphone, as it used much more memory and processing power than the smartphones on the market at the time. [88] [89] With its capacitive touchscreen and consumer-friendly design, the iPhone fundamentally changed the mobile industry, with Steve Jobs proclaiming in 2007, that the phone was not just a communication tool but a way of life. The dominant mobile operating systems at the time such as Symbian , BlackBerry OS , and Windows Mobile were not designed to handle additional tasks beyond communication and basic functions. These operating systems never focused on applications and developers, and due to infighting among manufacturers as well as the complexity of developing on their low-memory hardware, they never developed a thriving ecosystem like Apple's App Store or Android 's Google Play. [95] [96] IPhone OS (renamed iOS in 2010) was designed as a robust OS with capabilities such as multitasking and graphics in order to meet future consumer demands. [92] Many services were provided by mobile carriers, who often extensively customized devices. Meanwhile, Apple's decision to base its OS on OS X had the unexpected benefit of allowing OS X developers to rapidly expand into iOS development. [97] Rival manufacturers have been forced to spend more on software and development costs to catch up to the iPhone. The iPhone's success has led to a decline in sales of high-end fashion phones and business-oriented smartphones such as Vertu and BlackBerry , as well as Nokia. [95] [98] Nokia realised the limitations of its operating system Symbian and attempted to develop a more advanced system, Maemo, without success. It ultimately agreed to a technology-sharing deal and then a takeover from Microsoft. Prior to the iPhone, "Handsets were viewed largely as cheap, disposable lures, massively subsidized to snare subscribers and lock them into using the carriers' proprietary services." However, according to Wired , "Apple retained complete control over the design, manufacturing, and marketing of the iPhone", meaning that it and not the carrier would control the software updates, and by extension security patches. By contrast, Google has allowed carriers and OEMs to dictate the "pace of upgrades and pre-load phones with their own software on top of Android ". As a result, many Android OEMs often lag months behind Google's release of the next iteration of Android; although Nexus and Pixel devices are guaranteed two years of operating system updates and a third addition year for security. However, Apple has supported older iterations of iPhones for over four years. In December 2017, there were reports that Apple has been using a policy of slowing down the speed of its older iPhones when issuing operating system upgrades. [100] It has spurred allegations that the firm has been using this as a tactic to prompt users of older iPhones to buy newer models. Up to the iPhone 4 , all iPhone models, as well as other iOS devices were manufactured exclusively by Foxconn , based in Taiwan. In 2011, after Tim Cook became CEO of the company, Apple changed its outsourcing strategy, for the first time increasing its supply partners. The iPhone 4s in 2012 was the first model which was manufactured simultaneously by two stand-alone companies: Foxconn as well as Pegatron , also based in Taiwan. Although Foxconn is still responsible for the larger share of production, Pegatron's orders have been slowly increased, with the company being tasked with producing a part of the iPhone 5C line in 2013, and 30% of the iPhone 6 devices in 2014. The 6 Plus model is being produced solely by Foxconn. The touchscreen on the first five generations is a 9. in) liquid crystal display with scratch-resistant glass, while the one on the iPhone 5 is four inches. [8] The capacitive touchscreen is designed for a bare finger, or multiple fingers for multi-touch sensing. The screens on the first three generations have a resolution of 320×480 ( HVGA ) at 163 ppi ; those on the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S have a resolution of 640×960 at 326 ppi; the 4-inch models, with 640×1136 at 326 ppi; the 4.7-inch models, with 750×1334 at 326 ppi; and the 5.5-inch models, with 1080×1920 at 401 ppi. The initial models were using twisted-nematic (TN) LCDs. Starting with iPhone 4, the technology was changed to in-plane switching (IPS) LCDs. The iPhone 5 model's screen results in an aspect ratio of approximately 16:9. The iPhone X is the first iPhone to use an OLED display. It has a near bezel-less screen with a ~19.5:9 aspect ratio. The touch and gesture features of the iPhone are based on technology originally developed by FingerWorks. [103] Most gloves and styli prevent the necessary electrical conductivity; [104] [105] [106] [107] although capacitive styli can be used with iPhone's finger-touch screen. The iPhone 3GS and later also feature a fingerprint -resistant oleophobic coating. The top and side of an iPhone 5S, externally identical to the iPhone 5. From left to right, sides: wake/sleep button, silence switch, volume up, and volume down.. The iPhone has a minimal hardware user interface, with most models featuring five buttons. The only physical menu button is situated directly below the display, and is called the "Home button" because it's primary function is to close the active app and navigates to the home screen of the interface. Earlier models included a rounded square , reminiscent of the shape of icons on the home screen, however, new models which include Apple's fingerprint recognition feature Touch ID (which use the Home button as the fingerprint sensor) have no symbol. The iPhone X doesn't have a Home button but instead Face ID , a facial recognition authentication method. A multi-function sleep/wake button is located on the top of the device. It serves as the unit's power button, and also controls phone calls. When a call is received, pressing the sleep/wake button once silences the ringtone, and when pressed twice transfers the call to voicemail. Situated on the left spine are the volume adjustment controls. The iPhone 4 has two separate circular buttons to increase and decrease the volume; all earlier models house two switches under a single plastic panel, known as a rocker switch, which could reasonably be counted as either one or two buttons.. Directly above the volume controls is a ring/silent switch that when engaged mutes telephone ringing, alert sounds from new & sent emails, text messages, and other push notifications, camera shutter sounds, Voice Memo sound effects, phone lock/unlock sounds, keyboard clicks, and spoken auto-corrections. This switch does not mute alarm sounds from the Clock application, and in some countries or regions it will not mute the camera shutter or Voice Memo sound effects. [110] All buttons except Home were made of plastic on the original first generation iPhone and metal on all later models. The touchscreen furnishes the remainder of the user interface .. A software update in January 2008 [111] allowed the first-generation iPhone to use cell tower and Wi-Fi network locations trilateration , [112] despite lacking GPS hardware. Since the iPhone 3G generation, the iPhone employs A-GPS operated by the United States. Since the iPhone 4S generation the device also supports the GLONASS global positioning system, which is operated by Russia.. The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, introduced in 2015, feature " force-touch " displays which allows the screen to recognize how hard it is being pressed. An example of how this technology will be used is lightly pressing the screen to preview a photograph and pressing down to take it.. This section needs additional citations for verification.

Latest [ when? ] iPhone devices feature nine sensors, which are used to adjust the screen based on operating conditions, enable motion-controlled games, and location-based services .. A proximity sensor deactivates the display and touchscreen when the device is brought near the face during a call. This is done to save battery power and to prevent inadvertent inputs from the user's face and ears.. An ambient light sensor adjusts the display brightness which saves battery power and prevents the screen from being too bright or too dark.. A 3-axis accelerometer senses the orientation of the phone and changes the screen accordingly, allowing the user to easily switch between portrait and landscape mode. [113] Photo browsing, web browsing, and music playing support both upright and left or right widescreen orientations. [114] Unlike the iPad , the iPhone does not rotate the screen when turned upside-down, with the Home button above the screen, unless the running program has been specifically designed to do so. The 3.0 update added landscape support for still other applications, such as email, and introduced shaking the unit as a form of input. [115] [116] The accelerometer can also be used to control third-party apps , notably games. It is also used for fitness tracking purposes, primarily as a pedometer .. A magnetometer is built-in since the iPhone 3GS, which is used to measure the strength and direction of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the device. Sometimes certain devices or radio signals can interfere with the magnetometer requiring users to either move away from the interference or re-calibrate by moving the device in a figure-eight motion. Since the iPhone 3GS, the iPhone also features a Compass app which was unique at time of release, showing a compass that points in the direction of the magnetic field.. Beginning with the iPhone 4, Apple's smartphones also include a gyroscopic sensor , enhancing its perception of how it is moved.. Previous iPhone models contained a chip capable of receiving radio signals ; [117] however, Apple has the FM radio feature switched off because there was no antenna connected to the chip. Later iterations of the iPhone (starting with the iPhone 7), however, do not contain radio chips at all. [118] A campaign called "Free Radio On My Phone" was started to encourage cellphone manufacturers such as Apple to enable the radio on the phones they manufacture, reasons cited were that radio drains less power and is useful in an emergency such as the 2016 Fort McMurray Wildfire. All iPhone models starting from iPhone 5S (excluding the iPhone 5C and iPhone X ) feature Apple's fingerprint recognition sensor. It is used for unlocking the device and authenticating purchases (since the iPhone 6 ) using Touch ID. It is located in the home button.. Included on the iPhone 6 and later (excluding the iPhone SE ), a barometer used to determine air pressure, and elevation from the device. The iPhone X features a facial recognition sensor, named the TrueDepth camera system. It is used for unlocking the device and for authenticating purchases using Face ID. It can also be used for Animojis and AR .. From left to right is the headphone jack, microphone, Lightning connector, and built-in speaker on the base of the iPhone 5S.. On the bottom of the iPhone, there is a speaker to the left of the dock connector and a microphone to the right. There is an additional loudspeaker above the screen that serves as an earpiece during phone calls. The iPhone 4 includes an additional microphone at the top of the unit for noise cancellation , and switches the placement of the microphone and speaker on the base on the unit—the speaker is on the right. [121] Volume controls are located on the left side of all iPhone models and as a slider in the iPod application.. The 3.5mm TRRS connector for the headphones is located on the top left corner of the device for the first five generations (original through 4S), after which time it was moved to the bottom left corner. [122] The headphone socket on the first-generation iPhone is recessed into the casing, making it incompatible with most headsets without the use of an adapter. [123] Subsequent generations eliminated the problem by using a flush-mounted headphone socket. Cars equipped with an auxiliary jack allow handsfree use of the iPhone while driving as a substitute for Bluetooth. The iPhone 7 and later have no 3.5mm headphone jack, [124] and instead headsets must connect to the iPhone by Bluetooth , use Apple's Lightning port (which has replaced the 3.5mm headphone jack), or (for traditional headsets) use the Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter, which is included with all iPhone 7 and later units, and plugs into the Lightning port.. Apple's own headset has a multipurpose button near the microphone that can play or pause music, skip tracks, and answer or end phone calls without touching the iPhone. Some third-party headsets designed for the iPhone also include the microphone and control button. [125] The current headsets also provide volume controls, which are only compatible with more recent models. [126] A fourth ring in the audio jack carries this extra information.. The built-in Bluetooth 2.x+EDR supports wireless earpieces and headphones, which requires the HSP profile. Stereo audio was added in the 3.0 update for hardware that supports A2DP. [115] [116] While non-sanctioned third-party solutions exist, the iPhone does not officially support the OBEX file transfer protocol. [127] The lack of these profiles prevents iPhone users from exchanging multimedia files, such as pictures, music and videos, with other Bluetooth-enabled cell phones.. Composite [128] or component [129] video at up to 576i and stereo audio can be output from the dock connector using an adapter sold by Apple. IPhone 4 also supports 1024×768 VGA output [130] without audio, and HDMI output, [131] with stereo audio, via dock adapters. The iPhone did not support voice recording until the 3.0 software update. Replacing the battery requires disassembling the iPhone unit and exposing the internal hardware. The iPhone features an internal rechargeable lithium-ion battery. Like an iPod, but unlike most other mobile phones at the time of its launch, the battery is not user-replaceable. [123] [132] The iPhone can be charged when connected to a computer for syncing across the included USB to dock connector cable, similar to charging an iPod. Alternatively, a USB to AC adapter (or "wall charger," also included) can be connected to the cable to charge directly from an AC outlet. Some models of the iPhone support wireless charging. Apple runs tests on preproduction units to determine battery life. Apple's website says that the battery life "is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity after 400 full charge and discharge cycles", [134] which is comparable to iPod batteries.. The battery life of early models of the iPhone has been criticized by several technology journalists as insufficient and less than Apple's claims. [135] [136] [137] [138] This is also reflected by a J. Power and Associates customer satisfaction survey, which gave the "battery aspects" of the iPhone 3G its lowest rating of two out of five stars. If the battery malfunctions or dies prematurely, the phone can be returned to Apple and replaced for free while still under warranty. [141] The warranty lasts one year from purchase and can be extended to two years with AppleCare. The battery replacement service and its pricing was not made known to buyers until the day the product was launched; [142] [143] it is similar to how Apple (and third parties) replace batteries for iPods. The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights , a consumer advocate group, has sent a complaint to Apple and AT&T over the fee that consumers have to pay to have the battery replaced. [142] Apple reduced the price of an out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacement to $29. Since July 2007, third-party battery replacement kits have been available [145] at a much lower price than Apple's own battery replacement program. These kits often include a small screwdriver and an instruction leaflet, but as with many newer iPod models the battery in the first generation iPhone has been soldered in. Therefore, a soldering iron is required to install the new battery. The iPhone 3G uses a different battery fitted with a connector that is easier to replace. [146] The iPhone X features a different battery, with two battery cells, and the adhesive pull tabs are adhered to the sides instead of folded over the top, therefore making repairs a little more difficult than before. A patent filed by the corporation, published in late July 2013, revealed the development of a new iPhone battery system that uses location data in combination with data on the user's habits to moderate the handsets power settings accordingly. Apple is working towards a power management system that will provide features such as the ability to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used. On December 28, 2017, amidst many complaints about older iPhone models slowing down when new ones are released, Apple released a communication to its customers on its website, acknowledging the effect that old batteries have on the iPhone's performance. [144] The company offered $29 battery replacements as a solution. The iPhone 4 is the first generation to have two cameras. The LED flash for the rear-facing camera (top) and the forward-facing camera (bottom) are available on the iPhone 4 and subsequent models.. This section needs additional citations for verification.

The first-generation iPhone and iPhone 3G have a fixed-focus 2.0- megapixel camera on the back for digital photos. It has no optical zoom, flash or autofocus , and does not natively support video recording. (iPhone (original) & 3G can record video via a third-party app available on the App Store, and jailbreaking also allows users to do so.) iPhone OS 2.0 introduced geotagging for photos.. The iPhone 3GS has a 3.2-megapixel camera with autofocus, auto white balance, and auto macro (up to 10. Manufactured by OmniVision , the camera can also capture 640×480 ( VGA resolution) video at 30 frames per second. [150] The video can be cropped on the iPhone and directly uploaded to YouTube or other services.. The iPhone 4 introduced a 5.0- megapixel camera (2592×1936 pixels) that can record video at 720p resolution, considered high-definition. It also has a backside-illuminated sensor that can capture pictures in low light and an LED flash that can stay lit while recording video. [151] It is the first iPhone that can natively do high dynamic range photography. [152] The iPhone 4 also has a second camera on the front that can take VGA photos and record SD video. Saved recordings may be synced to the host computer, attached to email, or (where supported) sent by MMS .. The iPhone 4S' camera can shoot 8-MP stills and 1080p video, can be accessed directly from the lock screen, and can be triggered using the volume-up button as a shutter trigger. The built-in gyroscope can stabilize the image while recording video.. The iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S , running iOS 6 or later, can take panoramas using the built-in camera app, [153] and the iPhone 5 can also take still photos while recording video. The camera on the iPhone 5 reportedly shows purple haze when the light source is just out of frame, [155] although Consumer Reports said it "is no more prone to purple hazing on photos shot into a bright light source than its predecessor or than several Android phones with fine cameras..." [156]. On all five model generations, the phone can be configured to bring up the camera app by quickly pressing the home key twice. [157] On all iPhones running iOS 5 , it can also be accessed from the lock screen directly.. The iPhone 5S features True Tone Flash, which has two LED lights, white and amber, that will improve white balance and will be adjusted in 1,000 combinations.. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus included phase detection autofocus , while the 6 Plus has Optical Image Stabilization. Both models can now shoot 1080p videos at 60 frames per second.. The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are outfitted with a 12 megapixel camera, with 4K HD video capability. It also updated its front camera to five megapixels, which is good for capturing self-portraits. The user may change the resolution between 4K and 1080p from Settings.. The iPhone 7 features OIS on its rear camera, a feature that was previously exclusive to the Plus models, and the 7 Plus is the first iPhone to feature dual-lens cameras (both 12 MP), and they both have a 7 MP front-facing camera. The second camera on the iPhone 7 Plus is a telephoto lens , which enables 2x optical zoom and up to 10x digital zoom. The rear cameras on the 7 and 7 Plus both have a f/1.8 aperture. [124] It also has a new quad-LED True Tone flash, which is brighter compared to its predecessors.. The iPhone 8 camera remains largely the same as its predecessor, but it features a larger sensor, and a newer color filter. The camera can also now record 4K at 60 and 24 frames per second, and slow-mo at 1080p in 240 frames per second. The new camera system also enables Portrait Lighting, which defines the light in a scene. It also features a quad-LED True Tone flash, but it now has 2× better light uniformity and Slow Sync. The iPhone X camera is almost the same as the iPhone 8's camera, but the telephoto lens now has an aperture of f/2.4 and optical image stabilization. [159] The front camera also has Portrait Mode and Portrait Lighting, due to the new TrueDepth camera system. This section needs additional citations for verification.

The iPhone was initially released with two options for internal storage size: 4. On September 5, 2007, Apple discontinued the 4. On February 5, 2008, Apple added a 16. [162] The iPhone 3G was available in 16. [163] The iPhone 3GS came in 16. GB variants and remained available in 8. GB until September 2012, more than three years after its launch. The iPhone 4 was available in 16. GB variants, as well as an 8. GB variant to be sold alongside the iPhone 4S at a reduced price point. The iPhone 4S was available in three sizes: 16. The iPhone 5 and 5S were available in the same three sizes previously available to the iPhone 4S: 16. The lower-cost iPhone 5C model was initially available in 16. The iPhone 6 and 6S are available in three sizes: 16. The iPhone SE is available in 16. [164] By the time the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus was released, Apple ditched the based model from 16. Both 7 & 7 Plus has a configuration of 32, 128, & 256. [165] Apple doubled the storage on the iPhone 6S & 6S Plus in two configurations (32. GB), as well as the iPhone SE six months later.. An iPhone 5S with the SIM slot open. The SIM ejector tool is still placed in the eject hole.. GSM models of the iPhone use a SIM card to identify themselves to the GSM network. The SIM sits in a tray, which is inserted into a slot at the top of the device. The SIM tray can be ejected with a paper clip or the "SIM ejector tool" (a simple piece of die-cut sheet metal) included with the iPhone 3G and 3GS in the United States and with all models elsewhere in the world. [166] [167] Some iPhone models shipped with a SIM ejector tool which was fabricated from an alloy dubbed " Liquidmetal ". [168] In most countries, the iPhone is usually sold with a SIM lock , which prevents the iPhone from being used on a different mobile network. The GSM iPhone 4 features a MicroSIM card that is located in a slot on the right side of the device. The CDMA model of the iPhone 4, just the same as any other CDMA-only cell phone, does not use a SIM card or have a SIM card slot.. An iPhone 4S activated on a CDMA carrier, however, does have a SIM card slot but does not rely on a SIM card for activation on that CDMA network. A CDMA-activated iPhone 4S usually has a carrier-approved roaming SIM preloaded in its SIM slot at the time of purchase that is used for roaming on certain carrier-approved international GSM networks only. The SIM slot is locked to only use the roaming SIM card provided by the CDMA carrier. In the case of Verizon, for example, one can request that the SIM slot be unlocked for international use by calling their support number and requesting an international unlock if their account has been in good standing for the past 60 days. [172] This method only unlocks the iPhone 4S for use on international carriers. An iPhone 4S that has been unlocked in this way will reject any non international SIM cards (AT&T Mobility or T-Mobile USA, for example).. The iPhone 5 and later iPhones use the nano-SIM , in order to save more space for internal components.. All iPhones (as well as many other devices by Apple) have a small disc at the bottom of the headphone jack that changes from white to red on contact with water; the iPhone 3G and later models also have a similar indicator at the bottom of the dock connector. [173] Because Apple warranties do not cover water damage, employees examine the indicators before approving warranty repair or replacement .. The iPhone's indicators are more exposed than those in some mobile phones from other manufacturers, which carry them in a more protected location, such as beneath the battery behind a battery cover. These indicators can be triggered during routine use, by an owner's sweat, [174] steam in a bathroom, and other light environmental moisture. [175] Criticism led Apple to change its water damage policy for iPhones and similar products, allowing customers to request further internal inspection of the phone to verify if internal liquid damage sensors were triggered. The contents of the box of an iPhone 4. From left to right: iPhone 4 in plastic holder, written documentation, and (top to bottom) headset, USB cable, wall charger.. All iPhone models include written documentation, and a dock connector to USB cable. The first generation and 3G iPhones also came with a cleaning cloth. The first generation iPhone included a stereo headset ( earbuds and a microphone) and a plastic dock to hold the unit upright while charging and syncing. The iPhone 3G includes a similar headset plus a SIM eject tool (the first generation model requires a paperclip ). The iPhone 3GS includes the SIM eject tool and a revised headset, which adds volume buttons (not functional with previous iPhone versions). The iPhone 3G and 3GS are compatible with the same dock, sold separately, but not the first generation model's dock. [178] All versions include a USB power adapter, or "wall charger," which allows the iPhone to charge from an AC outlet. The iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS sold in North America, Japan, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru [179] [180] include an ultracompact USB power adapter.. In September 2014, with the launch of the iPhone 6 , Apple announced Apple Pay , a mobile payments system. The feature, aimed to "revolutionize" the way users pay, uses an NFC chip, Touch ID fingerprint scanner, Apple's Wallet app, and a dedicated "Secure Element" chip for encrypted payment information to make purchases at participating stores, both physical and online. Main articles: iOS and iOS version history. The iPhone runs an operating system known as iOS (formerly iPhone OS). [182] It is a variant of the same Darwin operating system core that is found in Mac OS X. Also included is the " Core Animation " software component from Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard. Together with the PowerVR hardware (and on the iPhone 3GS, OpenGL ES 2.0), it is responsible for the interface's motion graphics. The iPhone comes with a set of bundled applications developed by Apple, [183] and supports downloading third-party applications through the App Store. Apple provides free [185] updates to the operating system for the iPhone either wirelessly or through iTunes. [186] Major new updates have historically accompanied new models. The size of the operating system depends on version. While iOS 8 required over 4.5. GB, its successor required only 1.3. The interface is based around the home screen, a graphical list of available applications. iPhone applications normally run one at a time. Starting with the iPhone 4, a primitive version of multitasking came into play. Users could double click the home button to select recently opened applications. [190] However, the apps never ran in the background. Starting with iOS 7, though, apps can truly multitask, and each open application runs in the background when not in use, although most functionality is still available when making a call or listening to music. The home screen can be accessed at any time by a hardware button below the screen, closing the open application in the process. The original iPhone contained the following icons (apps): Messages ( SMS and MMS messaging), Calendar, Photos, Camera, YouTube, Stocks, Maps ( Google Maps ), Weather, Voice Memos, Notes, Clock, Calculator, Settings and iTunes (store). The App Store was introduced for the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4. Compass , FaceTime and GameCenter were added in iOS 4.0 and 4.1 respectively. In iOS 5, Reminders and Newsstand were added, as well as the iPod application split into separate Music and Videos applications. iOS 6 added Passbook as well as an updated version of Maps that relies on data provided by TomTom as well as other sources. YouTube no longer came as a pre-installed application.. Docked at the base of the screen, four icons for Phone , Mail , Safari (Internet), and Music delineate the iPhone's main purposes. [192] On January 15, 2008, Apple released software update 1.1.3, allowing users to create "Web Clips", home screen icons that resemble apps that open a user-defined page in Safari. After the update, iPhone users can rearrange and place icons (by holding down on any icon and moving it to the desired location once they start shaking) on up to nine other adjacent home screens, accessed by a horizontal swipe. Users can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons for the first-generation iPhone , 3G , 4 and 4S , while each home screen for iPhone 5 holds up to twenty-four icons due to a larger screen display, and the dock holds up to four icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time, and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs, could only be removed since the iOS 10 update. The 3.0 update adds a system-wide search, known as Spotlight , to the left of the first home screen. Almost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using multi-touch. The iPhone's interaction techniques enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as " pinching ".. Scrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object. Unlike previous scrollable views, in which the user pressed a "down" control to move the view "downwards", on iOS the user pushes upwards , as if moving a "plank of wood floating on the water", creating the impression that the user is directly manipulating the content displayed on the screen. Other user-centered interactive effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program, but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a "back" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.. When making a call, the iPhone presents a number of options, including FaceTime on supported models. The screen is automatically disabled when held close to the face.. The iPhone allows audio conferencing , call holding, call merging, caller ID , and integration with other cellular network features and iPhone functions. For example, if music is playing when a call is received, the music fades out, and fades back in when the call has ended.. The proximity sensor shuts off the screen and touch-sensitive circuitry when the iPhone is brought close to the face, both to save battery and prevent unintentional touches. The iPhone does not support video calling or videoconferencing on versions prior to the fourth generation, as there is only one camera on the opposite side of the screen. The iPhone 4 supports video calling using either the front or back camera over Wi-Fi, a feature Apple calls FaceTime. [196] Voice control, introduced in the iPhone 3GS, allows users to say a contact's name or number and the iPhone will dial it. [197] The first two models only support voice dialing through third-party applications. The iPhone includes a visual voicemail (in some countries) [199] feature allowing users to view a list of current voicemail messages on-screen without having to call into their voicemail. Unlike most other systems, messages can be listened to and deleted in a non-chronological order by choosing any message from an on-screen list.. A music ringtone feature was introduced in the United States on September 5, 2007. Users can create custom ringtones from songs purchased from the iTunes Store for a small additional fee. The ringtones can be three to 30 seconds long from any part of a song, can fade in and out, pause from half a second to five seconds when looped, or loop continuously. All customizing can be done in iTunes, [200] or with Apple's GarageBand software 4.1.1 or later (available only on Mac OS X ) [201] or third-party tools. With the release of iOS 6 , which was released on September 19, 2012, Apple added features that enable the user to have options to decline a phone call when a person is calling them. The user can reply with a message, or to set a reminder to call them back at a later time. The layout of the music library is similar to that of an iPod or current Symbian S60 phones. The iPhone can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists , genres , composers, podcasts , audiobooks , and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes. The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.. Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the iPhone 3GS, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist. The iPhone supports gapless playback. [204] Like the fifth-generation iPods introduced in 2005, the iPhone can play digital video , allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in widescreen. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and fullscreen video playback.. The iPhone allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPhone. The feature originally required a Wi-Fi network, but now since 2012, can use the cellular data network if one is not available. The iPhone includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the camera. The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPhone's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from iPhoto or Aperture on a Mac, or Photoshop on a Windows PC.. Wikipedia Main Page on the iPhone Safari web browser in landscape mode. Internet access is available when the iPhone is connected to a local area Wi-Fi or a wide area GSM or EDGE network, both second-generation ( 2G ) wireless data standards. The iPhone 3G introduced support for third-generation UMTS and HSDPA 3.6, [206] the iPhone 4S introduced support for HSUPA networks (14.4. Mbit/s), and support for HSDPA 7.2 was introduced in the iPhone 3GS. [207] Networks accessible from iPhone models include 1xRTT (represented by a 1x on the status bar) and GPRS (shown as GPRS on the status bar), EDGE (shown as a capital E on the status bar), UMTS and EV-DO (shown as 3G), a faster version of UMTS and 4G (shown as a 4G symbol on the status bar), and LTE (shown as LTE on the status bar). AT&T introduced 3G in July 2004, [209] but as late as 2007, Steve Jobs stated that it was still not widespread enough in the US, and the chipsets not energy efficient enough, to be included in the iPhone. [105] [210] Support for 802.1X , an authentication system commonly used by university and corporate Wi-Fi networks, was added in the 2.0 version update. By default, the iPhone will ask to join newly discovered Wi-Fi networks and prompt for the password when required. Alternatively, it can join closed Wi-Fi networks manually. [212] The iPhone will automatically choose the strongest network, connecting to Wi-Fi instead of EDGE when it is available. [213] Similarly, the iPhone 3G and onwards prefer 3G to 2G , and Wi-Fi to either. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth , and 3G (on the iPhone 3G onwards) can all be deactivated individually. Airplane mode disables all wireless connections at once, overriding other preferences. However, once in Airplane mode, one can explicitly enable Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth modes to join and continue to operate over one or both of those networks while the cellular network transceivers remain off.. Safari is the iPhone's native web browser , and it displays pages similar to its Mac and Windows counterparts. Web pages may be viewed in portrait or landscape mode and the device supports automatic zooming by pinching together or spreading apart fingertips on the screen, or by double-tapping text or images. [215] [216] Safari does not allow file downloads except for predefined extensions.. The iPhone does not support Flash , which was still popular when the iPhone was introduced. Consequently, the UK's Advertising Standards Authority adjudicated that an advertisement claiming the iPhone could access "all parts of the internet" should be withdrawn in its current form, on grounds of false advertising. In a rare public letter in April 2010, Apple CEO Steve Jobs outlined the reasoning behind the absence of Flash on the iPhone (and iPad ). [218] The iPhone supports SVG , CSS , HTML Canvas , and Bonjour. Google Chrome was introduced to the iOS on June 26, 2012, and Opera mini is also available.. The Maps application can access Google Maps in map, satellite , or hybrid form. It can also generate directions between two locations, while providing optional real-time traffic information. During the iPhone's announcement, Jobs demonstrated this feature by searching for nearby Starbucks locations and then placing a prank call to one with a single tap. [220] [221] Support for walking directions, public transit, and street view was added in the version 2.2 software update, but no voice-guided navigation. The iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 can orient the map with its digital compass. [223] Apple also developed a separate application to view YouTube videos on the iPhone, which streams videos after encoding them using the H.264 codec. Simple weather and stock quotes applications also tap into the Internet.. IPhone users can and do access the Internet frequently, and in a variety of places. According to Google , in 2008, the iPhone generated 50 times more search requests than any other mobile handset. [224] According to Deutsche Telekom CEO René Obermann, "The average Internet usage for an iPhone customer is more than 100. This is 30 times the use for our average contract-based consumer customers." [225] Nielsen found that 98% of iPhone users use data services, and 88% use the internet. [34] In China, the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS were built and distributed without Wi-Fi. With the introduction of the Verizon iPhone in January 2011, the issue of using internet while on the phone was brought to the public's attention. Under the two US carriers, internet and phone could be used simultaneously on AT&T networks, whereas Verizon networks only support the use of each separately. However, in 2014, Verizon announced that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus would allow simultaneous voice and data over its LTE Network. [228] T-Mobile and Sprint have enabled calls over Wi-Fi, with Verizon and AT&T soon doing the same. The virtual keyboard on the first generation iPhone touchscreen. For text input, the iPhone implements a virtual keyboard on the touchscreen. It has automatic spell checking and correction, predictive word capabilities, and a dynamic dictionary that learns new words. The keyboard can predict what word the user is typing and complete it, and correct for the accidental pressing of keys near the presumed desired key. The keys are somewhat larger and spaced farther apart when in landscape mode , which is supported by only a limited number of applications. Touching a section of text for a brief time brings up a magnifying glass , allowing users to place the cursor in the middle of existing text. The virtual keyboard can accommodate 21 languages, including character recognition for Chinese. Alternative characters with accents (for example, letters from the alphabets of other languages) and emoji can be typed from the keyboard by pressing the letter for two seconds and selecting the alternative character from the popup. [232] The 3.0 update brought support for cut, copy, or pasting text, as well as landscape keyboards in more applications. [115] [116] On iPhone 4S and above, Siri allows dictation.. Since iOS 8, third party keyboards, distributed through the App Store, are allowed. Previously, they were only available on jailbroken iPhones. The iPhone also features an email program that supports HTML email , which enables the user to embed photos in an email message. PDF , Word , Excel , and PowerPoint attachments to mail messages can be viewed on the phone. [234] Yahoo! offers a free push-email service for the iPhone. IMAP (although not Push-IMAP ) and POP3 mail standards are also supported, including Microsoft Exchange [235] and Kerio Connect. In the first versions of the iPhone firmware, this was accomplished by opening up IMAP on the Exchange server. Apple has also licensed Microsoft ActiveSync and supports the platform (including push email) with the release of iPhone 2.0 firmware. [237] [238] The iPhone will sync email account settings over from Apple's own Mail application, Microsoft Outlook , and Microsoft Entourage , or it can be manually configured on the device itself. The email program can access almost any IMAP or POP3 account. Text messages are presented chronologically in a mailbox format similar to Mail, which places all text from recipients together with replies. Text messages are displayed in speech bubbles (similar to iChat ) under each recipient's name. The iPhone has built-in support for email message forwarding, drafts, and direct internal camera-to-email picture sending. Support for multi-recipient SMS was added in the 1.1.3 software update. [240] Support for MMS was added in the 3.0 update, but not for the original first generation iPhone [115] [116] and not in the US until September 25, 2009. See also: iOS SDK and App Store. At WWDC 2007 on June 11, 2007, Apple announced that the iPhone would support third-party web applications using Ajax that share the look and feel of the iPhone interface. [243] On October 17, 2007, Steve Jobs, in an open letter posted to Apple's "Hot News" weblog , announced that a software development kit (SDK) would be made available to third-party developers in February 2008. The iPhone SDK was officially announced and released on March 6, 2008, at the Apple Town Hall facility. It is a free download, with an Apple registration, that allows developers to develop native applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch, then test them in an "iPhone simulator". However, loading an application onto a real device is only possible after paying an Apple Developer Connection membership fee. Developers are free to set any price for their applications to be distributed through the App Store , of which they will receive a 70% share. Developers can also opt to release the application for free and will not pay any costs to release or distribute the application beyond the membership fee. The App Store was launched with the release of iOS 2.0, on July 11, 2008. [238] The update was free for iPhone users; owners of older iPod Touches were required to pay US$10 for it. Once a developer has submitted an application to the App Store, Apple holds firm control over its distribution. Apple can halt the distribution of applications it deems inappropriate, for example, I Am Rich , a US$1000 program that simply demonstrated the wealth of its user. [247] Apple has been criticized for banning third-party applications that enable a functionality that Apple does not want the iPhone to have: In 2008, Apple rejected Podcaster , which allowed iPhone users to download podcasts directly to the iPhone claiming it duplicated the functionality of iTunes. [248] Apple has since released a software update that grants this capability. NetShare, another rejected app, would have enabled users to tether their iPhone to a laptop or desktop, using its cellular network to load data for the computer. [249] Many carriers of the iPhone later globally allowed tethering before Apple officially supported it with the upgrade to the iOS 3.0, with AT&T Mobility being a relative latecomer in the United States. [250] In most cases, the carrier charges extra for tethering an iPhone.. Before the SDK was released, third parties were permitted to design "Web Apps" that would run through Safari. [251] Unsigned native applications are also available for "jailbroken" phones. [252] The ability to install native applications onto the iPhone outside of the App Store is not supported by Apple, the stated reason being that such native applications could be broken by any software update, but Apple has stated it will not design software updates specifically to break native applications other than those that perform SIM unlocking. 2013 [update] , Apple has passed 60. 2016 [update] , there have been over 140. billion app downloads from the App Store. 2017 [update] , the App Store has over 2.2. The original iPhone has been described as "revolutionary", [258] a "game-changer" for the mobile phone industry, [259] [260] [261] [262] and has been credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies by 2011. [263] Newer iterations have also received praise, such as being called "the best phone". The iPhone attracts users of all ages, [34] and besides consumer use, the iPhone has also been adopted for business purposes. Starting with the iPhone 4S, Apple added an accessibility feature to optimize the function of the iPhone with hearing aids. [266] Apple released a program of Made for iPhone Hearing Aids. [267] These hearing aids deliver a power-efficient, high-quality digital audio experience and allow the user to manage the hearing aid right from the iPhone. Made for iPhone hearing aids also feature Live Listen. With Live Listen the iPhone acts as a remote microphone that sends sound to a Made for iPhone hearing aid. Live Listen can help the user hear a conversation in a noisy room or hear someone speaking across the room. The Braille Displays for iOS program was announced by Apple coinciding with the release of the iPhone 3GS, iPad and iPod Touch (3rd Generation). This program added support for more than 50 Bluetooth wireless braille displays that work with iOS out of the box. The user only needs to pair the keyboard to the device to start using it to navigate the iOS device with VoiceOver without any additional software. iOS supports braille tables for more than 25 languages. IPhone lets the user know when an alert is sent to the it, in a variety of notice methods. It delivers both visual and vibrating alerts for incoming phone and FaceTime calls, new text messages, new and sent mail, and calendar events. You can set an LED light flash for incoming calls and alerts. Or have incoming calls display a photo of the caller. Users can choose from different vibration patterns or even create their own. The iPhone can enlarge text to make it more accessible for vision-impaired users, [271] and can accommodate hearing-impaired users with closed captioning and external TTY devices. [272] The iPhone 3GS also features white on black mode, VoiceOver (a screen reader ), and zooming for impaired vision, and mono audio for limited hearing in one ear. [273] Apple regularly publishes Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates which explicitly state compliance with the US regulation " Section 508 ". With the release of iOS 9 for all iPhones, users have the ability to choose between two different screen view options. The user can choose to have a standard view or zoomed view. When the iPhone is placed in a standard view setting, the icons are normal size and the text remains the same. With a zoomed view option, the icons on the screen and the text become slightly larger. This enables the user to have a more customized appearance and it can potentially help some users read the screen easier.. AssistiveTouch helps to adapt the Multi-Touch screen of an iOS device to your unique physical needs. This can be of great assistance to those who have difficulty with some gestures, like pinch, one can make them accessible with just a tap of a finger. The user can create their own gestures and customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu. If the user has trouble pressing the Home button, it can be set so that it can be activated with an onscreen tap. Gestures like rotate and shake are available even when if the iOS device is mounted on a wheelchair. Guided Access helps people with autism or other attention and sensory challenges stay focused on the task (or app) at hand. With Guided Access, a parent, teacher, or therapist can limit an iOS device to stay on one app by disabling the Home button, and limit the amount of time spent in an app. The user can even restrict access to the keyboard or touch input on certain areas of the screen. So wandering taps and gestures won't distract from learning. See also: List of iOS devices §. 18 different iPhone models have been produced. The models in bold are the current flagship devices of the series:. Sources: Apple press release library [275]. Apple has filed more than 200 patent applications related to the technology behind the iPhone. LG Electronics claimed the design of the iPhone was copied from the LG Prada. Woo-Young Kwak, head of LG Mobile Handset R&D Center, said at a press conference: "we consider that Apple copied Prada phone after the design was unveiled when it was presented in the iF Design Award and won the prize in September 2006." [278] Conversely, the iPhone has also inspired its own share of high-tech clones. On September 3, 1993, Infogear filed for the US trademark "I PHONE" [280] and on March 20, 1996, applied for the trademark "IPhone". [281] "I Phone" was registered in March 1998, [280] and "IPhone" was registered in 1999. [281] Since then, the I PHONE mark had been abandoned. [280] Infogear trademarks cover "communications terminals comprising computer hardware and software providing integrated telephone, data communications and personal computer functions" (1993 filing), [280] and "computer hardware and software for providing integrated telephone communication with computerized global information networks" (1996 filing). Infogear released a telephone with an integrated web browser under the name iPhone in 1998. [283] In 2000, Infogear won an infringement claim against the owners of the iphones.com domain name. [284] In June 2000, Cisco Systems acquired Infogear, including the iPhone trademark. [285] On December 18, 2006, they released a range of re-branded Voice over IP (VoIP) sets under the name iPhone. In October 2002, Apple applied for the "iPhone" trademark in the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore, and the European Union. A Canadian application followed in October 2004, and a New Zealand application in September 2006. As of October 2006, only the Singapore and Australian applications had been granted.. In September 2006, a company called Ocean Telecom Services applied for an "iPhone" trademark in the United States, United Kingdom and Hong Kong, following a filing in Trinidad and Tobago. [287] As the Ocean Telecom trademark applications use exactly the same wording as the New Zealand application of Apple, it is assumed that Ocean Telecom is applying on behalf of Apple. [288] The Canadian application was opposed in August 2005, by a Canadian company called Comwave who themselves applied for the trademark three months later. Comwave has been selling VoIP devices called iPhone since 2004. Shortly after Steve Jobs' January 9, 2007 announcement that Apple would be selling a product called iPhone in June 2007, Cisco issued a statement that it had been negotiating trademark licensing with Apple and expected Apple to agree to the final documents that had been submitted the night before. [289] On January 10, 2007, Cisco announced it had filed a lawsuit against Apple over the infringement of the trademark iPhone, seeking an injunction in federal court to prohibit Apple from using the name. [290] In February 2007, Cisco claimed that the trademark lawsuit was a "minor skirmish" that was not about money, but about interoperability. On February 2, 2007, Apple and Cisco announced that they had agreed to temporarily suspend litigation while they held settlement talks, [292] and subsequently announced on February 20, 2007, that they had reached an agreement. Both companies will be allowed to use the "iPhone" name [293] in exchange for "exploring interoperability" between their security, consumer, and business communications products. On October 22, 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple for infringement of its GSM, UMTS and WLAN patents. Nokia alleges that Apple has been violating ten Nokia patents since the iPhone initial release. In December 2010, Reuters reported that some iPhone and iPad users were suing Apple Inc. because some applications were passing user information to third-party advertisers without permission. Some makers of the applications such as Textplus4, Paper Toss , The Weather Channel , Dictionary.com , Talking Tom Cat and Pumpkin Maker have also been named as co-defendants in the lawsuit. In August 2012, Apple won a smartphone patent lawsuit in the U.S. against Samsung , the world's largest maker of smartphones; [297] however, on December 6, 2016, SCOTUS reversed the decision that awarded nearly $400 million to Apple and returned the case to Federal Circuit court to define the appropriate legal standard to define "article of manufacture" because it is not the smartphone itself but could be just the case and screen to which the design patents relate. In March 2013, an Apple patent for a wraparound display was revealed. Since April 20, 2011, a hidden unencrypted file on the iPhone and other iOS devices has been widely discussed in the media. [300] [301] It was alleged that the file, labeled "consolidated.db", constantly stores the iPhone user's movement by approximating geographic locations calculated by triangulating nearby cell phone towers , a technology proven to be inaccurate at times. [302] The file was released with the June 2010 update of Apple iOS4 and may contain almost a year's worth of data. Previous versions of iOS stored similar information in a file called "h-cells.plist". F-Secure discovered that the data is transmitted to Apple twice a day and postulate that Apple is using the information to construct their global location database similar to the ones constructed by Google and Skyhook through wardriving. [304] Nevertheless, unlike the Google "Latitude" application, which performs a similar task on Android phones, the file is not dependent upon signing a specific EULA or even the user's knowledge, but it is stated in the 15,200 word-long terms and conditions of the iPhone that "Apple and [their] partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of [the user's] Apple computer or device". The file is also automatically copied onto the user's computer once synchronized with the iPhone. An open source application named "iPhoneTracker", which turns the data stored in the file into a visual map, was made available to the public in April 2011. [306] While the file cannot be erased without jailbreaking the phone, it can be encrypted. Apple gave an official response on their web site on April 27, 2011, [308] after questions were submitted by users, the Associated Press and others. Apple clarified that the data is a small portion of their crowd-sourced location database cache of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers which is downloaded from Apple into the iPhone for making location services faster than with only GPS, therefore the data does not represent the locations of the iPhone. The volume of data retained was an error. Apple issued an update for iOS (version 4.3.3 , or 4.2.8 for the CDMA iPhone 4) which reduced the size of the cache, stopped it being backed up to iTunes, and erased it entirely whenever location services were turned off. [308] The upload to Apple can also be selectively disabled from "System services", "Cell Network Search." Regardless, in July 2014, a report on state-owned China Central Television labeled the iPhone a "national security concern." [309]. A feature that can be found under "location services" in the settings of the iPhone has also been found to be secretly tracking the user's information. This feature is called "frequent locations" and it can either be kept on or turned off. This feature is said to help the accuracy of the GPS and Apple Maps since it can log information about the locations the user has frequently visited. However, this feature also keeps track of the number of times that the user has been to that location, the dates, and the exact times. A lot of people have found this feature to be intrusive of their personal lives and have since then had an option to keep it on or shut it off. It was revealed as a part of the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures that the American and British intelligence agencies, the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have access to the user data in iPhones, BlackBerrys, and Android phones, respectively. They can read almost all smartphone information, including SMS, location, emails, and notes. According to an article in The New York Times titled "Signaling Post-Snowden Era, New iPhone Locks Out N.S.A.", Apple has developed a new encryption method for iOS 8, described as "so deep that Apple could no longer comply with government warrants asking for customer information to be extracted from devices." [312]. Throughout 2015, prosecutors in the United States argued for the U.S. government to be able to compel decryption of iPhone contents. [313] [314] [315] [316] After the 2015 San Bernardino attack , the FBI recovered an iPhone 5C that was issued to one of the shooters by his employer, and iCloud backups of that phone from a month and a half before the shooting. (The shooters had destroyed their personal phones.) The U.S. government attempted to use the arcane and outdated All Writs Act to obtain a court order ordering Apple to produce an IPSW file that would allow investigators to brute force the passcode of the iPhone, which would equate to modernized slavery. [317] [318] [319] Tim Cook responded on the company's website, outlining a need for encryption, arguing that if they produce a backdoor for one device, it would inevitably be used to compromise the privacy of other iPhone users. [320] On February 19, Apple communicated to journalists that the password for the Apple ID for the iPhone had been changed within a day of the government obtaining it, preventing Apple from producing a workaround that would only target older devices. [321] See FBI–Apple encryption dispute .. As of April 2016, Apple's Privacy Policy addresses requests from government agencies for access to customers' data: "Apple has never worked with any government agency from any country to create a "backdoor" in any of our products or services. We have also never allowed any government access to our servers. And we never will." [322] In 2015 the Electronic Frontier Foundation awarded Apple five out of five stars "commend[ing] Apple for its strong stance regarding user rights, transparency, and privacy." [323]. See also: Hardware restrictions §. Apple tightly controls certain aspects of the iPhone. According to Jonathan Zittrain , the emergence of closed devices like the iPhone have made computing more proprietary than early versions of Microsoft Windows. The hacker community has found many workarounds, most of which are disallowed by Apple and make it difficult or impossible to obtain warranty service. [325] " Jailbreaking " allows users to install apps not available on the App Store or modify basic functionality. SIM unlocking allows the iPhone to be used on a different carrier's network. [326] However, in the United States, Apple cannot void an iPhone's warranty unless it can show that a problem or component failure is linked to the installation or placement of an after-market item such as unauthorized applications, because of the Federal Trade Commission 's Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act of 1975. The iPhone also has an area and settings where users can set restrictions or parental controls [328] on apps that can be downloaded or used within the iPhone. The restrictions area requires a password. The iPhone normally prevents access to its media player and web features unless it has also been activated as a phone with an authorized carrier. On July 3, 2007, Jon Lech Johansen reported on his blog that he had successfully bypassed this requirement and unlocked the iPhone's other features with a combination of custom software and modification of the iTunes binary. He published the software and offsets for others to use. Unlike the first generation iPhone, the iPhone 3G must be activated in the store in most countries. [331] This makes the iPhone 3G more difficult, but not impossible, to hack. The need for in-store activation, as well as the huge number of first-generation iPhone and iPod Touch users upgrading to iPhone OS 2.0, caused a worldwide overload of Apple's servers on July 11, 2008, the day on which both the iPhone 3G and iPhone OS 2.0 updates as well as MobileMe were released. After the update, devices were required to connect to Apple's servers to authenticate it, causing many devices to be temporarily unusable. Users on the O2 network in the United Kingdom, however, can buy the phone online and activate it via iTunes as with the previous model. [333] Even where not required, vendors usually offer activation for the buyer's convenience. In the US, Apple has begun to offer free shipping on both the iPhone 3G and the iPhone 3GS (when available), reversing the in-store activation requirement. Best Buy and Walmart will also sell the iPhone. See also: iOS jailbreaking and iPhone Dev Team. The iPhone's operating system is designed to only run software that has an Apple-approved cryptographic signature. This restriction can be overcome by "jailbreaking" the phone, [335] which involves replacing the iPhone's firmware with a slightly modified version that does not enforce the signature check. Doing so may be a circumvention of Apple's technical protection measures. [336] Apple, in a statement to the United States Copyright Office in response to Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) lobbying for a DMCA exception for this kind of hacking, claimed that jailbreaking the iPhone would be copyright infringement due to the necessary modification of system software. [337] However, in 2010, Jailbreaking was declared officially legal in the United States by the DMCA. [338] Jailbroken iPhones may be susceptible to computer viruses, but few such incidents have been reported. iOS and Android 2.3.3 'Gingerbread' may be set up to dual boot on a jailbroken iPhone with the help of OpeniBoot or iDroid. In 2007, 2010, and 2011, developers released a series of tools called JailbreakMe that used security vulnerabilities in Mobile Safari rendering to jailbreak the device (which allows users to install any compatible software on the device instead of only App Store apps). [343] [344] [345] Each of these exploits were quickly fixed by iOS updates from Apple. Theoretically these flaws could have also been used for malicious purposes. In July 2011, Apple released iOS 4.3.5 (4.2.10 for CDMA iPhone) to fix a security vulnerability with certificate validation. Following the release of the iPhone 5S model, a group of German hackers called the Chaos Computer Club announced on September 21, 2013, that they had bypassed Apple's new Touch ID fingerprint sensor by using "easy everyday means." The group explained that the security system had been defeated by photographing a fingerprint from a glass surface and using that captured image as verification. The spokesman for the group stated: "We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics. It is plain stupid to use something that you can't change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token." [348] [349]. iPhone 3G shown with the SIM tray partially ejected. Most iPhones were and are still [ citation needed ] sold with a SIM lock , which restricts the use of the phone to one particular carrier, a common practice with subsidized GSM phones. Unlike most GSM phones however, the phone cannot be officially unlocked by entering a code. [ citation needed ] The locked/unlocked state is maintained on Apple's servers [ citation needed ] per IMEI and is set when the iPhone is activated. [350] [ not in citation given ]. While the iPhone was initially sold in the US only on the AT&T network with a SIM lock in place, various hackers have found methods to " unlock " the phone from a specific network. [351] Although AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon are the only authorized iPhone carriers in the United States [ citation needed ] , unlocked iPhones can be used with other carriers. [352] For example, an unlocked iPhone may be used on the T-Mobile network in the US but, while an unlocked iPhone is compatible with T-Mobile's voice network, it may not be able to make use of 3G functionality (i.e. no mobile web or e-mail, etc.). [353] [ not in citation given ] More than a quarter of the original first generation iPhones sold in the US were not registered with AT&T. Apple speculates that they were likely shipped overseas and unlocked, a lucrative market before the iPhone 3G's worldwide release. On March 26, 2009, AT&T in the United States began selling the iPhone without a contract, though still SIM-locked to their network. [355] The up-front purchase price of such iPhone units is often twice as expensive as those bundled with contracts. Outside of the United States, policies differ, especially in US territories and insular areas like Guam ; GTA Teleguam was the exclusive carrier for the iPhone since its introduction, as none of the four US carriers (AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon) have a presence in the area. [357] Since 2013, Docomo Pacific ended GTA's exclusivity starting with the iPhone 5. Beginning April 8, 2012, AT&T began offering a factory SIM unlock option (which Apple calls a "whitelisting", allowing it to be used on any carrier the phone supports) for iPhone owners. It has been reported that all of the Verizon 4G LTE phones come factory unlocked. After such discovery, Verizon announced that all of their 4G LTE phones, including iPhones, would remain unlocked. This is due to the regulations that the FCC has placed on the 700. MHz C-Block spectrum [ citation needed ] , which is used by Verizon. In the United Kingdom, O2 , EE , 3 , Vodafone , and Tesco Mobile sell the device under subsidised contracts, or for use on pay as you go. They are locked to the network initially, though they can usually be unlocked either after a certain period of contract length has passed, or for a small fee (with the exception of the 3 network, which will unlock the device at any time for no charge). [361] However, all current versions of iPhone are available for purchase SIM-free from the Apple Store or Apple's Online Store, consequently, they are unlocked for use on any GSM network too. Four major carriers in Australia ( Optus , Telstra , Virgin Mobile , and Vodafone ) [363] offer legitimate unlocking, now at no cost for all iPhone devices, both current and prior models.. Internationally, policies vary, but many carriers sell the iPhone unlocked for full retail price. In 2003, four years before the iPhone was officially introduced, the trademark iFone was registered in Mexico by a communications systems and services company, iFone. [364] Apple tried to gain control over its brandname, but a Mexican court denied the request. The case began in 2009, when the Mexican firm sued Apple. The Supreme court of Mexico upheld that iFone is the rightful owner and held that Apple iPhone is a trademark violation. In Brazil , the brand IPHONE was registered in 2000 by the company then called Gradiente Eletrônica S.A., now IGB Eletrônica S.A. According to the filing, Gradiente foresaw the revolution in the convergence of voice and data over the Internet at the time. In Brazil, the final battle over the brandname concluded in 2008. On December 18, 2012, IGB launched its own line of Android smartphones under the tradename to which it has exclusive rights in the local market. [366] In February 2013, the Brazilian Patent and Trademark Office (known as "Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial") issued a ruling that Gradiente Eletrônica, not Apple, owned the "iPhone" mark in Brazil. The "iPhone" term was registered by Gradiente in 2000, 7 years before Apple's release of its first iPhone. This decision came three months after Gradiente Eletrônica launched a lower-cost smartphone using the iPhone brand. In June 2014, Apple won, for the second time, the right to use the brandname in Brazil. The court ruling determined that the Gradiente's registration does not own exclusive rights on the brand. Although Gradiente intended to appeal, with the decision Apple can use freely the brand without paying royalties to the Brazilian company. In the Philippines , Solid Group launched the MyPhone brand in 2007. Stylized as "my|phone", Solid Broadband filed a trademark application of that brand. Apple later filed a trademark case at the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) against Solid Broadband's MyPhone for "confusingly similar" to the iPhone and that it may likely "deceive" or "cause confusion" among consumers.. Apple lost the trademark battle to Solid Group in a 2015 decision made by IPO director Nathaniel Arevalo, who also reportedly said that it was unlikely that consumers would be confused between the "iPhone" and the "MyPhone". "This is a case of a giant trying to claim more territory than what it is entitled to, to the great prejudice of a local 'Pinoy Phone' merchant who has managed to obtain a significant foothold in the mobile phone market through the marketing and sale of innovative products under a very distinctive trademark," Arevalo later added. ^ "Apple stock soars to a record high on great earnings and a strong forecast for the next iPhone".

Through historical accident, we've ended up with a global network that pretty much allows anybody to communicate with anyone else at any time. Devices could be reprogrammed by them at any time, including code written by other people, so you don't have to be a nerd to get the benefits of reprogramming it. [But] this is an historical accident. Now, I see a movement away from that framework—even though it doesn't feel like a movement away. [For example,] an iPhone can only be changed by Steve Jobs or soon, with the software development kit, by programmers that he personally approves that go through his iPhone apps store. Or whimsical applications that run on the Facebook platform or the new Google apps. These are controllable by their vendors in ways that Bill Gates never dreamed of controlling Windows applications. But for my purposes, even under the standard Windows operating system from 1990, 1991, you write the code, you can hand it to somebody else and they can run it. Bill Gates has nothing to say about it. So it's funny to think that by moving in Steve Jobs's direction it actually ends up far more proprietary. ^ Johnston, Michael (October 20, 2007).

Got a tip for us? Let us know. Prices dropped by $100 in September 2017.. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are Apple's lower-cost iPhones, with camera improvements, a glossy black color, faster processors, and improved water resistance implemented through a click-less haptic home button and no headphone jack. The iPhones first launched on Sept. 16, 2016 and were replaced by the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus on Sept. Dual-lens camera for iPhone 7 Plus. Subscribe for regular MacRumors news and future iPhone 7 info.. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus How to Buy Issues Power Management for Depleted Batteries No Service LTE Performance Jet Black iPhone - Peeling Regulatory Labels Matte Black iPhone - Chipping Design Black and Jet Black Color Options Water Resistance Display 3D Touch Redesigned Home Button Taptic Engine Touch ID A10 Fusion Processor RAM No Headphone Jack AirPods Battery Life Camera Video iPhone 7 Plus - Dual Cameras FaceTime Camera Other Features Speakers Bluetooth, NFC, and FeliCa LTE Wi-Fi iPhone 7 Timeline. As of September 2017, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have been replaced by the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus , and iPhone X. Apple is still selling the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus as lower-cost devices, but the two iPhones are no longer the company's flagship smartphones.. On the surface, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus devices don't look very different from the previous-generation iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, continuing to feature the same 4.7 and 5.5-inch screen sizes and the same dimensions, but there are a few visual differences and several important internal changes.. Antenna bands no longer span across the back of the devices, for a cleaner, sleeker look, and there are new colors being sold alongside the standard Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold shades: a matte black color Apple is just calling "Black" and a "Jet Black" with a high-gloss finish .. Most notably when it comes to design, the body of the iPhone 7 has been reengineered to be IP67 dust and water resistant , so it can hold up to splashes, rain, and brief submersion in water. Apple's warranty doesn't cover water damage, though, so it's best to be cautious with water exposure.. There is no physical Home button on the iPhone 7, as it has been replaced by a "solid-state" pressure sensitive button that's connected to a redesigned Taptic Engine to deliver haptic feedback mimicking traditional button presses. The display is 25 percent brighter and supports wide color gamut for richer, true-to-life colors.. Inside, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are equipped with an A10 Fusion processor , which is 40 percent faster than the processor in the iPhone 6s. It features two high-performance cores for system intensive tasks and two high-efficiency cores that operate at 1/5 the power to save battery life for smaller tasks.. With the processor improvements, the two devices have the best battery life ever offered in an iPhone. Those upgrading from the iPhone 6s will see two additional hours of battery life on average, while those upgrading from the iPhone 6s Plus will see an additional hour.. There is no headphone jack in the iPhone 7, so headphones that connect to it need to be Bluetooth or equipped with a Lightning connector. Apple is shipping the iPhone with Lightning EarPods and a 3.5mm to Lightning adapter , plus it has designed completely wireless high-tech AirPods to ease the transition.. Stereo speakers , located at the top and bottom of the iPhone, are a new addition, and the biggest feature improvement comes in the form of an overhauled camera system. The iPhone 7 features a 28mm 12-megapixel camera with optical image stabilization , a wider f/1.8 aperture 6-element lens, wide color capture , and a revamped Apple image signal processor, all of which result in brighter, sharper, more detailed photos, even in low-light conditions.. The iPhone 7 Plus features all of the camera improvements in the iPhone 7, but in addition to a 28mm wide-angle lens, it has a second 56mm telephoto lens for dual-camera functionality that enables better optical zoom. It also includes a new shallow-depth-of-field portrait mode that uses the two lenses to draw out the portrait subject while blurring the background.. Both iPhones have a four-LED flash that's 50% brighter and stronger, plus an upgraded 7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera with improved sensor technology and auto image stabilization for better selfies and clearer FaceTime calls.. Following the release of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, Apple lowered the price of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus and slimmed down the iPhone 7 lineup. The two devices are now available in 32 and 128GB capacities, and there is no longer a (PRODUCT)RED model. Prices now start at $549 for the iPhone 7 and $669 for the iPhone 7 Plus.. In September of 2017, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus lineup was simplified and prices were lowered by $100. There are now two capacities: 32GB and 128GB, and the device is available in Silver, Gold, Rose Gold, Jet Black, and Matte Black.. In the United States, iPhone 7 pricing starts at $549 for the 32GB model, with the 128GB model priced at $649. iPhone 7 Plus pricing starts at $669 for the 32GB model, with the 128GB model priced at $769.. Apple is also offering the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in its online refurbished store at prices starting at $499.. Jet Black iPhone - Peeling Regulatory Labels. In devices that have degraded lithium-ion batteries, Apple has introduced power management features that can slow down the iPhone during times of peak power draw to prevent unexpected shutdowns.. Apple first introduced the power management features in iOS 10.2.1, but the issue received additional attention at the end of 2017 after it became clear that power management involved slowing down iPhones with batteries that are running at a sub-optimal level.. Several lawsuits were filed against Apple accusing the company of deliberately slowing devices to encourage upgrades, which Apple says it does not do. Power management features are designed to extend the life of the iPhone rather than shorten it.. Following significant backlash over the issue, Apple announced a $29 battery replacement program , allows customers who have an iPhone 6 or later to replace their batteries for $29 regardless of battery health.. Each older iPhone is entitled to one low-cost battery replacement. Supplies may be limited in early 2018 due to demand, but Apple is offering reduced-cost batteries through the end of the year.. Any customers who are affected by the power management features and slowdowns because of a depleted battery will see improved performance after replacing the battery. It's important to note, though, that even those affected by throttling will not see it at all times -- it only kicks in at certain times when the processor is taxed.. As promised back in December, iOS 11.3 beta 2 introduces a new "Battery Health" section to the Battery portion of the Settings app, which provides iOS users with more information about the health of their iPhone battery.. It includes details on current maximum capacity, current operating performance, and if an iPhone is subjected to throttling via power management features, it offers a toggle to turn it off. More details can be found in our how to post .. Power management features impact the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus.. Apple has launched a repair program for iPhone 7 models impacted by an ongoing bug that causes them to say "No Service" even when cellular coverage is available.. Apple is offering free repairs for devices impacted by this issue, which includes iPhone 7 devices with the following model numbers: A1660, A1779, and A1780. Customers in need of a repair should contact Apple support, visit an Apple Authorized Service Provider, or visit an Apple retail store.. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus use different LTE modems, sourced from Intel and Qualcomm. The Intel modem only supports GSM and is limited to the AT&T and T-Mobile networks in the U.S., while the Qualcomm modem supports GSM/CDMA and is available for Verizon and Sprint. According to iPhone 7 Plus testing done by Cellular Insights, the Intel iPhone models perform worse than the Qualcomm models when in areas with poor signal. When signal strength is good, there are no performance problems, and real world experience may vary from user to user.. Apple may also be throttling the LTE performance of the Verizon iPhone 7 with a Qualcomm modem to keep it on par with the AT&T iPhone 7 with an Intel modem. Based on testing, the Verizon iPhone 7 should significantly outperform the AT&T iPhone 7, but instead, the two devices perform similarly with the Verizon iPhone 7 displaying only a slight edge.. When compared to a Samsung Galaxy S7 that also has a Qualcomm chip, the Verizon iPhone 7 could not compete, suggesting Apple has limited its performance to ensure feature parity between iPhone models on different networks.. Apple customers who purchased a Jet Black iPhone 7 or 7 Plus should exercise caution when using a device skin that covers the back of the smartphone. Several iPhone owners have discovered that when the skin is peeled off, it removes part of the regulatory labeling and rear text, such as "Designed by Apple in California.". A number of customers who purchased the matte Black iPhone 7 or 7 Plus have noticed that the anodized finish on their devices has started chipping or peeling off in areas where there has allegedly been little wear. According to Apple, the chipping is a normal cosmetic issue and is not covered by warranty.. Black and Jet Black Color Options. On the outside, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus look a lot like the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus. The dimensions, aside from weight, are identical. The iPhone 7 measures in at 138.3mm tall, 67.1mm wide, and 7.1mm thick, while the iPhone 7 Plus is 158.2mm tall, 77.9mm wide, and 7.3mm thick.. At 138 grams and 188 grams for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, respectively, the two devices are slightly lighter than previous-generation iPhones.. Design wise, there are few visual differences between the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 7, aside from relocated antenna bands that no longer span across the back of the iPhone and larger protruding cameras, a feature that is especially noticeable on the larger iPhone 7 Plus with a dual-camera setup.. On the bottom of the iPhone 7, there's no longer a headphone jack. The space has been replaced by a second set of speaker holes, which are largely cosmetic. The first hole on the left side of the device is a microphone, while the rest are designed to match the right side of the phone.. To distinguish the iPhone 7 from the iPhone 6s, Apple has focused on introducing two new colors sold alongside the traditional Gold, Rose Gold, and Silver finishes. There's a dark matte light-diffusing "Black" shade that replaces Space Gray and a glossy "Jet Black" that's entirely new, with a pristine, mirror-like surface.. The high-shine Jet Black color is achieved through a unique dye bath and anodization process, and while its finish is eye-catching, Apple warns that it is prone to "micro-abrasions" and recommends those who are worried about scratches keep it in a case.. The iPhone 7 might look a lot like the iPhone 6s, but it's been re-engineered from the inside out with new seals and new adhesive techniques to make it more water and dust resistant. It has a dust/water resistance rating of IP67, meaning it's entirely dust proof and able to withstand 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes. It's safe from splashes and accidental submersion, but don't take it swimming.. Tests have proven that the iPhone 7 can survive immersion in a variety of liquids, from coke and hot coffee to sea water. There's even been a test to see how well it does in deep water.. Apple is using a display in the iPhone 7 that's 25 percent brighter than the display in the iPhone 6s, so it's going to look brighter and clearer outdoors, especially in full sunlight. The display is also using a cinema-standard wide color gamut and end-to-end color management, for more vivid, saturated colors.. The resolution of the display is the same, at 1134 x 750 (326 ppi) for the iPhone 7 and 1920 x 1080 (401 ppi) for the iPhone 7 Plus, and the screen sizes continue to measure in at 4.7 inches for the iPhone 7 and 5.5 inches for the iPhone 7 Plus.. DisplayMate says the iPhone 7 has the "best LCD display" it's ever tested, calling it a "major upgrade" over the iPhone 6s.. iPhone 7 achieved the highest color accuracy, peak brightness, and contrast rating in bright light of any smartphone display, the highest contrast ratio of any IPS LCD display, and the lowest screen reflectance of any smartphone display.. 3D Touch continues to be an integral part of the display, built into one of the display layers. 3D Touch is an expanded multi-touch feature that allows the iPhone to measure different levels of pressure in addition to taps, swipes, and pinches.. 3D Touch is used across iOS 9 and iOS 10 to enable shortcut gestures called a "Peek" and a "Pop" both at the home screen and in iOS apps. A light press enables a Peek, while a deeper press enables a Pop, and there are unique swipe gestures to open up menus and take actions when using Peeks.. The Home button on the iPhone 7 looks like the iPhone 6s Home button, but it's no longer a physical button. Apple calls it a "solid state" button, and when you press on it, you get haptic feedback from the Taptic Engine to mimic a button press, similar to the trackpad on the latest MacBooks.. Instead of feeling the sensation of pressing down on an actual button, when you use the Home button on the iPhone 7, you'll feel haptic vibrations in response to let you know that actions like unlocking the iPhone's screen or making a payment with Apple Pay have been successful.. When setting up the iPhone 7, you can choose the level of haptic feedback you want, ranging from light to powerful, with a setting in the middle available. It should be noted that the iPhone 7 Home button is capacitive , requiring skin contact or the right kind of capacitive gloves to press. It otherwise won't register touch, unlike the physical home buttons of earlier devices.. The Home button in the iPhone 7 is powered by a redesigned and updated Taptic Engine, a piece of hardware that was first introduced in the iPhone 6s. According to Apple, the Taptic Engine is more responsive and works with a wider range of frequencies.. It is used throughout the iPhone 7 system for everything from the Home button to notification vibrations, and for the first time, it can be programmed by third-party applications for new feelings and experiences that were not previously available.. The Touch ID fingerprint sensor that replaces passwords and offers additional security for things like Apple Pay payments is still located on the Home button, despite the Home button's redesign.. Second-generation Touch ID technology is built into the iPhone 7 and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor is as quick as the one in the iPhone 6s.. Apple improves the processor in each iteration of the iPhone, and in the iPhone 7, some impressive features have been included for the best chip performance in an iOS device yet. The A10 Fusion has a four-core CPU (the first in an iOS device) that combines power and efficiency in a unique way. It is "incredibly thin" and was made on TSMC's 16 nm FinFET+ process .. There are two high-performance cores, which are 40 percent faster than the A9 chip in the iPhone 6s and twice as fast as the A8 chip in the iPhone 6. There are also two high-efficiency cores that run at 1/5th of the speed of the high-performance cores to preserve battery when doing tasks that aren't system intensive.. An Apple-designed performance controller switches between the two core systems and makes sure the correct processes are running for maximum performance and maximum battery. When doing something that requires the more powerful CPU, such as gaming, the high-power cores run. When doing something that doesn't require a lot of power, like sending a message or an email, the high-efficiency cores turn on to draw less power and use less battery.. Benchmarking tests have proven that the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus are indeed equipped with the fastest mobile processor Apple has produced yet, outperforming the A9X in the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.. The iPhone 7 is faster than Samsung devices , even recent ones, and it can even outperform most MacBook Air models.. Along with the four-core CPU, the iPhone 7 features a six-core graphics chip that's 60 percent faster than the A9 and three times faster than the A8. At the same time, it draws one-third less power than the A9 and half as much power as the A8.. There is an embedded M10 motion coprocessor in the A10 Fusion chip that captures motion-based data from the compass, accelerometer, and gyroscope to power Apple's health and fitness capabilities without significant power drain.. For more detail on the A10 Fusion and the improvements it brings, make sure to check out our post covering the processor advancements introduced in the iPhone 7 and the Apple Watch Series 2.. Due to the increased demands of a dual-camera system and the software necessary to process images, Apple has equipped the iPhone 7 Plus with 3GB RAM.. The iPhone 7, which uses only a single lens camera, continues to have 2GB RAM like the iPhone 6s.. There is no headphone jack in the iPhone 7, so headphones need to connect wirelessly or through the Lightning port. The removal of the headphone jack was done to save space and to make room for new technologies, plus Apple is using its elimination to drive the development of wireless headphone technology.. To ease the transition away from the 3.5mm headphone jack, Apple is including Lightning EarPods and a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter in each iPhone box. Apple has also developed new wireless headphones called AirPods and introduced new wireless Beats models.. AirPods, Apple's new wireless earbuds, look a lot like standard EarPods without the wires. Reviews suggest they're similar in shape and size, but the internals are entirely different. There are no wires between the AirPods -- each operates independently. You can wear both at the same time or wear a single one for a phone or FaceTime call.. AirPods feature Bluetooth and an Apple-designed W1 chip, the first wireless chip Apple has created for intelligent, high-efficiency playback with a consistent, reliable connection. AirPods have an infrared sensor built in to detect when they're in the ear, and motion accelerometers respond to touch gestures, such as a double tap to activate Siri.. Voice accelerometers recognize when you're talking and then team up with beamforming microphones to reduce external noise, plus Apple says the AirPods have "incredible sound.". Apple's goal, which it says no one has achieved, is a "wireless future" where all devices intuitively connect. AirPods are the first step towards that goal. The W1, paired with iCloud, connect seamlessly to all Apple devices with a one-step setup procedure and can instantly switch between devices. Apple calls it a "magical experience.". AirPods last for five hours on a single charge and ship with a case that doubles as a battery source, for more than 24 total hours of battery life. AirPods and the case can be charged through a Lightning connector. Apple originally planned to release the AirPods in late October, but opted to delay the launch until December to work out some remaining bugs. AirPods officially became available for purchase online on December 13, 2016 and from retail stores on December 19, 2016.. According to Apple, processor improvements and bigger physical batteries have resulted in the longest battery life ever in an iPhone. Those upgrading from an iPhone 6s to an iPhone 7 will see two hours of additional battery life on average while iPhone 7 Plus users upgrading from an iPhone 6s Plus will see at least an hour more battery life. In most cases, users will see much greater increases in battery.. Curiously, when broken down on Apple's site, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus get longer battery life during internet use and video playback, but shorter battery life for audio playback and talk time. Still, Apple says average battery life during real-world usage has improved.. Based on device teardowns, the iPhone 7 has a 1,960 mAh battery, an improvement over the 1,715 mAh battery in the iPhone 6s. The iPhone 7 Plus has a 2,900 mAh battery, up from 2,750 mAh in the iPhone 6s Plus.. iPhone 7 Plus - Dual Cameras. The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus feature a huge jump forward in camera technology, for photographs that are clearer, brighter, and crisper, even in low-light conditions.. Optical image stabilization, once a feature limited to the 5.5-inch iPhone, is built into the iPhone 7, compensating for small movements and hand shakiness when snapping a photo to allow for longer exposure times (3x longer than iPhone 6s). There's a new 6-element f/1.8 aperture lens that lets 50 percent more light into the sensor while keeping photos sharp at the edges.. The 12-megapixel high-speed sensor is 60 percent faster and 30 percent more efficient, and there's a new image signal processor with twice the throughput for faster camera performance across the board.. The image signal processor, custom designed by Apple, sets exposure, focus, white balance, and uses wide color capture for more true-to-life images. It features fourth-generation tone mapping and noise reduction, performing 100 billion operations in just 25 milliseconds every single time a photo is taken with the iPhone.. Wide color gamut support results in richer colors, especially for greens and some shades of red. Low-light photo capture is improved, and Live Photos feature stabilization, can be edited, and are accessible to third-party developers via new Capture and Edit APIs. In addition to facial recognition, the iPhone 7 also features full body recognition.. Professional camera tests have lauded the iPhone 7's excellent exposure, lower noise output, and richer colors, calling it a solid improvement over the camera in the iPhone 6s. The camera features great exposures with wide dynamic range, accurate white balance and color rendering, and good detail preservation when shooting outdoors in bright daylight.. A redesigned four-LED rear flash puts out 50 percent more light and reaches 50 percent further, plus it has a flicker sensor that can read the flickering of artificial lighting and can compensate for it in both photo and video.. The rear camera is protected by a sapphire lens cover to keep it safe from scratches.. Video taking capabilities haven't been improved in the iPhone 7. It still includes 4K video recording at 30fps and 1080p video recording at 30 or 60fps. 1080p Slo-mo video support is available at 120fps and 240fps at 720p.. All of the features built into the iPhone 7 are included in the iPhone 7 Plus, but it has one other unique feature -- a second lens. The first lens in the iPhone 7 Plus is the same wide-angle 28mm lens included in the iPhone 7, but it is installed alongside a second 12-megapixel 56mm telephoto lens with an f/2.8 aperture.. The two lenses create a new zoom feature that allows iPhone 7 Plus users to switch seamlessly between standard 1x zoom and an optical 2x zoom, right within the camera app. Optical zoom is superior to digital zoom because there's no loss of detail, but the 2x optical zoom function also enables better digital zoom for clearer photos up to 10x closer.. Apple says that because you're starting with a 2x lens when you zoom in with the iPhone 7 Plus, the quality is up to four times better than digital zoom in the iPhone 6s.. As of iOS 10.1, the two cameras in the iPhone 7 Plus can be used for a new "Portrait" feature that uses shallow depth of field to make portrait photos "pop," as is possible with a high-end DSLR. To achieve this, Apple's image signal processor scans a scene, using machine learning techniques to recognize people.. It creates a depth map of the image from the two cameras, keeping the people in focus while applying an artful blur to the background. There's even a Live Preview effect that lets you see the background blur before taking the photo, something that's unique to the iPhone. "Portrait" is a feature in the camera app alongside other options like "Video" and "Panorama.". The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus feature a 7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera for better-than-ever selfies and clearer FaceTime calls. There's new sensor technology for sharper images, auto image stabilization to reduce shakiness, and the wide color capture feature of the rear-camera is also available on the FaceTime camera.. There are two speakers in the iPhone 7, introducing surround sound for the first time. One speaker is at the bottom of the phone and one is at the top, for stereo sound in both portrait and landscape orientations. The two speakers put out twice the volume of the single speaker in the iPhone 6s and have a better overall sound thanks to increased dynamic range.. The iPhone 7 features Bluetooth 4.2 for connecting to Bluetooth devices like the AirPods, and it has an NFC chip for use with Apple Pay.. New in iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models sold in Japan is a FeliCa chip, which allows them to work with the FeliCa payments standard that's been widely adopted in the country. In Japan, Apple Pay users can use the payments service anywhere Suica, iD, and QuicPay.. The iPhone 7 features LTE Advanced for data transfer speeds up to 450Mb/s and support on more LTE bands around the world.. Unlike the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, which worked on any network, GSM iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models designed for the AT&T and T-Mobile networks are not compatible with the CDMA networks of Verizon and Sprint. This is because Apple has used LTE chips from both Qualcomm and Intel in its devices. GSM devices with Intel chips are not equipped with CDMA functionality, whereas Qualcomm chips work on both GSM and CDMA networks.. That means a T-Mobile or AT&T iPhone cannot later be used on the Verizon or Sprint network. Verizon and Sprint, iPhones, however, support both the GSM and CDMA networks and can later be used with AT&T or T-Mobile.. iPhone models A1660 and A1661 are Verizon and Sprint models compatible with GSM and CDMA networks.. iPhone models A1778 and A1784 are AT&T and T-Mobile models that are only compatible with GSM networks.. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus support 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi with MIMO. The technology is the same as the Wi-Fi technology in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, with connection speeds that can reach up to a theoretical maximum of 866Mb/s..

Many Apple fans are still trying to get their hands on a new iPhone 7 , but we're already hearing rumors about the iPhone 8.. Apple is developing hardware for the iPhone 8, which will be released next year, at an office in Israel, Business Insider reported on Wednesday, citing an unnamed local employee.

The next iPhone should be called the iPhone 7S, but "S" updates have traditionally been incremental and focused on software. Next year is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone , and Apple is expected to pull out all the stops. Other names that have been floated for Apple's next phone are the iPhone X or iPhone Anniversary..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars HONEST REVIEW. *I paid for this item in full, at my expense. I didn't receive this for free or at a discounted price. Of the two screen protectors, one came from a crack (probably occurred during packaging or shipping). Comes with cleaning kits, "squeeze card", dust stickers. I was going to return the product after I saw one of the protectors had a crack in it, but decided out of necessity to use the other screen protector for my phone. From the looks of it, the protector is like a firm plexiglass; I applied some pressure (after seeing the crack) to see how it would bend, since I've seen other reviews of other screen protectors being entirely flexible. (See photos) Packaging sucks, and for that reason this product gets 4 stars. The sleeves that the product comes in are thin and sheer. The protective box seems sturdy by itself, but to protect glass during shipping, not reliable. (See photo, I applied pressure to it and it twisted) Either this box needs to be upgraded, or the shipping and handling needs some work. My product came in a bubble envelope with a hole, so maybe the reason why the protector came cracked was because of that, who knows? The "squeeze card" was also bent and no, I had not used the product prior to the picture. The phone is responsive to the touch, and works fine with the screen protector. Until further notice, this protector seems to be decent for the price it is. Will report back if anything occurs, see photos and make your own judgment. ***EDIT: 7/5/2016 I DROPPED MY PHONE! I was in line at a burger joint, about to pay. I was holding my wallet and my phone in one hand, while trying to open my wallet with the other hand, and my phone dropped face down onto the floor. I'm 5'1, but I dropped it at about chest level. I was so scared to flip it over and see that my screen was cracked, BUT IT WASN'T! Only the glass screen protector cracked a bit in the corner (WILL INSERT PHOTOS WHEN I GET TO BF'S HOUSE), but other than that, my screen is completely fine. THANK GOD! I highly recommend this screen protector! It really does work, and I am ordering my boyfriend a pair, since he has an iPhone 6+. On a side note, the company contacted me twice to ensure that I was satisfied with their product, at which point I told them my other screen came cracked. They apologized and sent me a replacement PAIR for free, and this was aside from my warranty. I originally wasn't going to say anything because it could've been the shipping company's fault, so I didn't want to make it an issue for the TechMatte company, but they were so caring and generous to send me another pair for free. Moral of this review: 1) Don't take the chance of not having a screen protector! 2) This company has really good customer service and their product is amazing. 3) They have a very good warranty! 5/5 for good product, good customer service, and good warranty! Cheers!. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Apple-like quality experience and great post-sale customer service. After all, it's just a screen protector, right? Not with this company. It starts with Apple-like packaging that reflects the quality inside. They include everything you need including wet and dry wipes, dust removal stickers, installation guide, bubble squeeze card and warranty card (yes, warranty). The screen protectors come inside a foam pouch and have a protective film layer on one side (phone facing) and a plastic protective layer with tabs (for aligning) on the other. The instructions are very clear and have drawings as well as well written text in proper English. The alignment tabs are a great tool to get the protector on just right and not get fingerprints on it during the application. Strangely, the protector seemed to magically smooth itself out so didn't get any bubbles after applying. The company specifically makes it clear that the screen protectors are a little smaller because of the curved edges of the phone and to avoid lifted edges. Although I could see the edges, I couldn't feel them at all when holding the phone. Furthermore, when I put the case on it was not even noticeable. The company followed up to make sure I was satisfied.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars I had purchased a I phone 8 and of course didn't want to spend what like 40 to 75 dollars on a sreen protector so .... my testimony to the Glass protective screens are as follows. I had purchased a I phone 8 and of course didn't want to spend what like 40 to 75 dollars on a sreen protector so I dabbled on Amazon. I purchased one from a competitor and to be honest I can't remember there name but let me tell you totally disappointed as I have oily skin and I also put beard oil in. The screen protector that I bought from a different supplier had the worst, I mean it wouldn't even clean with rubbing Alcohol smug marks just nasty, so I was now gambling to find another like my old one that I got from my verizon store on my old phone, so I ran into this one and believe me when I say WOW! no marks, No smugging, Just like you get from the retailers, and best yet under $10.00 Must say GReat buy and going to buy my daughter one. Hope this helps anyone else in the market for a great screen protector.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Easy Quick and Best screen protector. I have used so many screen protectors, including great brands like Peel. However, I never had good experience in applying the screen protectors. This TechMatte screen protector is exceptional. I brought this protector for my iPhone 6. It worked perfectly fine and I could able to apply this protector without any any issues. This pack comes with two protectors and applying materials and nice small cloth to wipe out the dirt. I liked this product and I recommend it for two reasons... it is not expensive and easy to apply without any issues.. Was this review helpful to you?. Emily D Photography Top Contributor: Photography. 5.0 out of 5 stars Saved My Phone’s Screen!. I waited to review this product until I could thoroughly test the screen protector. I applied the screen protector onto my iPhone 7 back in September of 2017 and just had to replace the screen protector with a new one and it’s February of 2018. I’ve dropped my phone several times with the screen protector on and it hasn’t cracked. My phone was not in the case all the way when I dropped it last week. The phone flew out of the case and went sliding. I though for sure the screen would be shattered, but only the screen protector was cracked! It literally and physically saved my phone’s screen from shattering! The screen protector was easy to apply and comes with all the wipes and tape you need to clean the screen. Have patience and apply the screen protector in a well lit area. Turning the phone off helps the alignment of the screen protector and the black part of the screen. I highly recommend this screen protector!. Was this review helpful to you?. Premium quality screen protector and an amazing seller. 5.0 out of 5 stars Premium quiality.

Forget the iPhone 7 — here are 7 reasons the 2017 iPhone will blow everyone away. Antonio Villas-Boas , Business Insider US. This will not be an “S” model. The front surface will be all display with no borders or bezels. It will mostly be made of glass. The home button will be invisible. It will have an incredible screen. It won’t have a headphone jack.. Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 on Wednesday, and while it has a few great features that improve on the 6s, some people aren’t pleased that it looks identical to the iPhone 6 generation.. For those of you unimpressed by the iPhone 7, you might feel differently about Apple’s next iPhone, which we expect Apple to announce in 2017.. Next year marks the 10-year anniversary of the iPhone, and all rumors are pointing to a radical redesign.. Check out the latest rumors surrounding Apple’s next NEXT iPhone.. MacRumors spotted a report from an analyst at Barclay’s that claims Apple will skip the “S” model this year, which has historically followed each new phone version, and jump directly from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone 8 in 2017.. Since 2017 marks the iPhone’s 10th anniversary, it wouldn’t be surprising if Apple does something special to mark the anniversary of its most important product.. Rumors that the iPhone 8 will have an all-display front surface first emerged from John Gruber, the plugged in Apple blogger and podcaster from Daring Fireball .. Gruber claims he has heard insider scuttlebutt that the iPhone 8’s front won’t have any bezels or borders, and that it’ll be one large display.. A report from Apple analyst Ming Chi Kuo, who often accurately predicts new Apple products and features, says that the iPhone 8’s body will be made of glass. If so, it could have a similar aesthetic as the iPhone 4 and 4s, both of which had a glass back.. Gruber claims the home button, which also houses the fingerprint sensor, will be embedded into the front glass panel , making it invisible.. Gruber’s claims line up nicely with rumors posted by tech site i4u that a future iPhone will have an embedded home button.. Rumors from The Korea Herald news site suggest the 2017 iPhone will have an AMOLED display, which would look better than the LCD display in current iPhones.. The Barclay’s analyst report summarized by MacRumors claims that the iPhone 8 will have wireless charging.. Most recently, a patent submitted by Apple on September 9 shows the company is still looking to optimize wireless charging solutions.. Since the iPhone 7 doesn’t have a headphone jack, we can expect future iPhones won’t feature a headphone jack, either..
