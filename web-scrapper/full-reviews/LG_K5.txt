Affordable smartphones are comprehensively replacing age-old keypad phones, something which is imminent. Both global and local plans are aiming at this market before it saturates with a big list of models. Asian markets like the Philippines have shown a huge demand in this budget smartphone section selling huge numbers by the day.. LG K5 is an entry-level Android-based device providing everything that is expected to be present in a utility smartphone on an extremely low budget. And utility is the most important function in these devices.. It is evident that this device is not meant to stun with its looks. But as an entry-level smartphone, this model does easily impress with its slim and smooth contours. LG K5 dimensions come in at 141.5 x 71.6 x 8.9 mm so it is quite nifty to hold with one hand given that it weighs in at only 128 grams.. A MeidaTek MT6582 chipset and a Quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7 processor run this LG K5 making it fast and highly utilitarian – one of its winning features. A Mali-400 MP2 GPU helps the whole matter along with a 1 GB RAM. The Internal Storage comes in at 8 GB with a 32 GB expandable option with an external MicroSD slot.. LG K5 primary rear camera is a 5 MP Autofocusing tool with LED flash and a f/2.8 aperture. And this is a strong selling point for this model. This camera can provide sound still images as well as 1080p HD video recording functions of a superior enough quality. Front camera specs come in at 2MP with a similar aperture. Added features such as Gesture Shot, Tap and Shoot, Selfie-Flash are among others that have made this model a hot option in the specific sections of buyers.. LG K5 runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop and the manufacturers may provide upgrades to higher versions of this OS such a 5.1.1 which has added UI features. This smartphone has Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, 3G compatible and provides an ease of functions from all aspects thanks to its strong processing specs.. Display specs come in at 480 x 584 pixels with a 196 PPI (pixels per inch) density. Despite the modest resolution, this 5 inch FWVGA touchscreen does impress with its 16M color depth. And it fits right in with a 66.4% screen to body ratio.. A 1900 mAh removable battery runs this whole setup, and this model is reviewed to provide about 9 hours of 3G browsing time on full charge.. The last few years has seen this Filipino market show a huge demand for smartphones across multiple budget segments. Selling both feature and budget phones right of mobile stores, the Philippines is currently one of the hottest markets in the world.. LG K5 has garnered rave reviews, especially with its affordability. Simply, the presence of certain high-end features at such a low budget is what has moved this model to the top of the sales sheets over the years..

LG K5 - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 4 ». euphie13, 27 Dec 2017 Can anyone tell me how to make my sdcard sa the default storage? LG K5 phone That's my issue too. Can anyone tell me how to make my sdcard sa the default storage? LG K5 phone. The only thing that don't suck in this phone is the touchscreen LCD which is protected by Asahi Dragontrail Glass. I kept on punching it, smashing it in my knee and my table but NO SCRATCH and DAMAGE at all, UNBELIEVABLE! But the screen stopped working though and turned into white, like completely white. You might be wondering why I kept punching it and smashing it everywhere because the bottom-right part kept on clicking on itself. I have no idea why it became like that. I used it for like 4 months now and it suddenly has ghost movements in the bottom-right part. It's annoying because while I'm playing it kept on going to multitasking, it's like the phone itself is annoying the sh*t out of me lol.. Both cameras are garbage, the battery sucks but charges really fast and you can drop it or smash it and keeps working nice... The only problem is the memory and the battery. For a budget phone it is okay. I had a sumsung j3 b4 this ph it got smashed. I brought the LG for 1 buck dearer because of the gigs and the front facing camera has 13mps as my samsung only had 8 and 5 but the battery life on the Samsung was so much better even though the battery specs for both Phs were similar. I could listen to music all day on my Samsung and only use 15% I try to listens to music all day on the LG and it's dead in 8hrs.. can i root my lg k5 ? plz help me to root it. it is very imporant to me. also can i upgrade this os to another upper os ?. Please FCC ID of this phone. Lester, 13 Mar 2017 Can someone tell me how to remove the word prediction when typing a text messages? Thanks Go to keyboard setting and and turn off the predictive text suggestion word. pls i need one, if possible tomorrow. How do move apps or games in SD card?. mark, 12 Mar 2017 my lgk5 is not clear camera. idont know if defective or what... Don't waste your phone on some dummy selfies. I bought this LG K5 yesterday and the camera of this phone really SUCKS!. Why do I expect it's just a cheap phone.. mark, 12 Mar 2017 my lgk5 is not clear camera. idont know if defective or what... First and foremost, the 2 cameras absolutely suck. I'm so disappointed, but what can I expect for a cheap/budget phone. I just wish they've put on a decent selfie camera at least. Another bad thing is it lack the most simplest functions of a smart phone. I mean cmon, it doesn't have the display function of the percentage (%) number of the battery on top of the status bar (which is important in monitoring usage), it doesn't enable to create a photo album in the gallery, and you can't even move or copy a single photo to another folder (are u kidding me?). You can do it in File manager but cmon, it takes a little too much time. This phone also lags when you use facebook. Doesn't have a light indication when charging, and can't use mp3 files for ringtones. Calls and text messaging are good. Has loud speakers but that's all there is. Better save up for a much higher LG model. I'm an LG fan and the G4 was the best phone I had that's why I tried this one but man this one is so disappointing. The ASUS Zenfone Go 4.5 has the same price in the store and it has way way more functions and way better that this one. Rating 1/10 - Phone absolutely suck.. mark, 12 Mar 2017 my lgk5 is not clear camera. idont know if defective or what... My camera og LG K5 has jo auto focus? Is it normal or defect?. friendlykapitbahay, 06 Apr 2017 go to settings>>language and input>keyboard settings lol. Can someone please tellme how to turn off the camera shutter sound on k5? Ty.

Cómo hago para que el almacenamiento sea en el micro sd,,,le coloque una de 16 y la memoria del teléfono está completa, no logro descargar nada !!!. Mi consulta es sobre la bateria : cuando tuve mi celular lg k5 se apagaba por si solo compre una bateria y se me sigue apagando ¿que sera? .. Siempre los celulares si cambias de bateria supuestamente tendrian que andar sin ninguna falla ¿no?. Requiero el FCC ID del LG K5 Dual, quien me puede ayudar con esta información.. Me han regalado un móvil LG K5 dual, cuando le pongo mi tarjeta SIM el móvil se enciende pero sólo aparece la cámara, no sé si es problema de no insertar bien la tarjeta o es otra cuestión. Mi cámara del lg k 5 no puedo ingresar ya que me sale un mensaje que dice"la cámara no se puede ocupar. Cierre otras aplicación que impidan el acceso". ALGUIEB SABE COMO ARREGLAR ESTE PROBLEMA? CELULAR. Necesito saber cómo se asigna marcacon rápida a números de teléfono. Quisiera saber si este teléfono es doble sim o. para los que no pueden pasar las app a la memoria externa: primero desbloquearla para escritura, hay una app q se llama sdFix, es lo mas facil pero yo no la he probado. yo lo hice con un modulo de xposed. segundo, deben rootear el telefono, hay tutoriales para todos los modelos en google. tercero, deben crear una segunda particion en la tarjeta sd, con formato EXT3. para particionar la sd lo hacen con la misma app que copiara los apk a la sd, se llama apps2sd, ojo que no funciona si no rootean el cel antes. Compre un celular lg K5 pero resulta q cada vez q salgo de mi casa y me alejo del wi-fi el teléfono me bloquea el ingreso de llamadas, por tanto debo estar reiniciándolo... Si me olvido de reiniciarlo todas las llamadas ingresan a buzón cono si el celular estuviera apagado... Alguien me puede decir que puedo hacer???. porque no puedo pasar los archivos y app a la memoria externa???. aun cuando la memoria externa la elegí como predeterminada??.

CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors.

The LG G5's modular party pieces are yet to be fully realized, but away from that you've got a supremely solid flagship smartphone - if only the battery was a bit better.. The best LG G5 deals What's next? Everything you need to know about the LG G6 LG G5 price Design. The LG G5 attempted to shake up the smartphone market, and while the phone itself is considered a flop, the direction it tried to push is still noticeable today.. [Update: The LG G5 could be replaced in a matter of weeks by the LG G6 , but with a lower price tag and solid spec list the G5 is an enticing proposition with some great deals to be had .]. Modular capabilities were the big draw for the LG G5, with the promise of additional functionality delivered by add-ons you could buy separately giving you cool extra features.. In reality though, the LG G5's modules (or 'Friends' as it like to refer to them) were lackluster, with a camera grip, audio DAC and 360 camera the only options to speak of.. The phone itself was still one of the top flagship devices of 2016, and while it's since been superseded by the LG G6 and V30 , for those on a budget the G5 provides an interesting alternative to many of the cookie cutter devices on the market.. If you're looking for a modular device, Motorola has a line of great Moto Mods which work on a number of phones including the Moto Z2 Force and Z2 Play .. LG G5 is a modular smartphone and a massive change of pace for the South Korean firm. It's done away with cheap plastic and confusing leather finishes of the LG G4 in favor of a full metal body, while keeping fan-favorite features like a removable battery and microSD card.. That's a big deal, because Samsung disappointed a vocal minority when it ditched its swappable battery and expandable storage hallmarks for the Galaxy S6 and realized the errors of its way as it reinstated microSD support in the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge a year later.. The LG G5 may not be as ornate as Samsung's glass-and-metal-fused phone, or Apple's aluminum iPhone 6S , but it's a step in the right direction after the questionably styled G4.. Not only does it include perks for power users, LG's changed the way we access the battery with a cartridge-like input so you don't have to remove the back cover.. This 'magic slot' is located in the bottom frame of the phone and doubles as an accessory port. Add-ons include a battery grip with physical camera controls and a Hi-Fi audio module.. Weight : 159g Dimensions : 149.4 x 73.9 x 7.7 mm OS : Android Marshmallow (upgradeable to Android Nougat) Screen size : 5.3-inch Screen Resolution : 1440x2560 CPU : Snapdragon 820 RAM : 4GB Storage : 32GB Battery : 2800mAh Rear camera : 16MP+8MP Front camera : 8MP. You don't really need either of these accessories to enjoy the camera or audio, though. LG G5 has a dual-camera setup on the back, with one lens that provides extra-wide photos.. The front is highlighted by an always-on, 5.3-inch display. It never goes to sleep, with the time, date and notification icons visible when the phone is off.. When it comes to price, it launched at around $650 (£500, AU$890) SIM-free for the LG G5, which put it slightly below the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 6S. Thing is, the G5 hasn't flown off the shelves.. Almost a year on from launch it's seen its SIM-free price slashed to $442 (£350, around AU$580), and LG has openly admitted it's been disappointment with the G5's "somewhat slow" sales.. You also have a big 5.7-inch distraction if you live in the US: the newer LG V20 , which comes with a dual-camera system in both the front and the back and runs Android 7 Nougat software out of the box. Some LG G5 phones still run Android Marshmallow .. It's far from over for the LG G5 though, and there's still a lot to love about this smart modular phone.. The LG G5 looks and feels completely different to the G4, and that's thanks to the all-metal body that rightfully kicks the plastic to the curb.. It feels suitably smooth, although the G5 struggles to feel as premium the likes of the iPhone 6S or Samsung Galaxy S7. That's thanks to a relatively thick layer of primer-paint mix which LG has used to the color the G5.. Initially I thought the G5 felt more like plastic, and it can be deceiving, but the sturdy aluminum frame becomes more apparent the more you use it. This doesn't mean the G5 feels cheap, far from it in fact, but the finish doesn't sing in your hand.. The slender metallic rim which rounds round the edges of the handset on the rear adds an extra layer of class, but it also feels a little sharp. It's not as cutting on my final unit compared to the pre-production model I had, but it's not exactly smooth.. Unlike Apple's handset the LG G5 won't be notorious for antenna lines. It doesn't have any of those unsightly bands, instead relying on Micro-Dizing to cover up antenna slits.. This allows you to enjoy color of the device, and in the G5's case you get a choice of four: silver, titan (gray), pink and gold. The pre-production handset I used was pink, and the color is rather muted. It's not as dazzling as Apple's rose gold, but at the same time it seems a little apologetic.. The hue will likely appeal to some, but for me it doesn't really work. The final review unit I received came sported the silver paint, and it's more agreeable to the eye.. Another big difference between the design of the LG G5 and its predecessor is the fact that the curved design has been ditched.. Gone is the bananaphone style of the LG G4 and its even curvier cousin, the LG G Flex 2 , and it returns to the flat frontage which is the norm in the mobile market.. I say flat - it's almost there, but LG couldn't help itself, with the G5's front sloping away from you at the top and bottom. It's a slightly odd finish which offers little in the way of aesthetic grace or practical use.. LG's reason for the switch is simple - consumers preferred the flat designs of rival handsets over its own curved offerings.. The LG G5 feels more balanced in the hand and it's easier to slip into a pocket.. Downsized from a 5.5-inch screen on the G4 to 5.3 inches and roughly the same amount of bezel, the LG G5 feels light at 159g and easy to hold in one hand measuring 149.4 x 73.9 x 7.7mm.. I can reach apps across the entire display without resorting to using two hands, which ties into LG's goal of making the phone all about ease of use and something to recommend to mom and dad. This does, of course, depend on your palm size as those with smaller hands will still find the G5 a bit of a beast.. In fact the G5 is almost identical in size to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, which despite having a larger 5.5-inch display has managed to keep excess to a minimum.. LG G5's volume rocker has shifted to the left side of the frame, ending the company's opinion-dividing practice of having the buttons flank the power button on back.. While I got used to that quirky rear-facing volume keys and clean edges on the G2, G3 and G4, LG's signature feature was a flaw for many.. I'm relatively indifferent about the new side volume rocker, however it does make changing volume much easier when it's lying on a desk. Sadly, that same ease of use can't be said for the fingerprint scanner.. The still-back-facing power button doubles as a fingerprint sensor on the G5, and while it's better than the questionable experimentation on the LG V10 , it's still too small.. Like the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL , it can light up the phone and unlock the screen quickly without you having to press the button. There's no two-step process, as it was on the press-in-and-hold-hold-hold LG V10.. The gentle volcanic protrusion it rests on also makes it relatively easy to find, but a slightly larger landing pad would have been nice. The real Achilles heal is realized when you place the G5 on a surface.. I tend to have my phone sitting on my desk at work, and if I want to unlock the phone to read a message I'm forced to either tap in my code - ugh, slow - or pick it up and place my finger on the reader.. With the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7 , their front mounted finger scanners allow me to unlock far more easily. Even the Sony Xperia Z5 's side mounted effort is better in this respect.. Sticking with the rear of the G5 and it's the area where most are likely to decide whether they love or hate the look of the phone. The protruding power key sits below a far larger raised area which house the G5's dual camera lenses as well as the LED flash and laser auto focus.. It's a sizable presence, and to some it may look like the phone has sprung a couple of nasty growths. On the other hand the protrusions are minimal and if you opt for the darker titan (grey) model they seem less obvious.. Something I'm not really a fan of is the headphone jack and speaker placement. Headphones plug into the top, unless you have the 32-bit Hi-Fi DAC module that is, as that adds a second headphone jack to the bottom. Worse, the speaker is on the bottom. I was really hoping that the LG G5 would upgrade to a pair of front-facing speakers for stereo sound without resorting to headphones. LG has redesigned its bottom port, however. It uses a USB-C connection, which means all of your micro USB cables are useless. The advantage? It's reversible, unlike all other USB forms.. That's a huge win for anyone taking advantage of that always-on display and plugging in their phone in the dark. Just be prepared to carry around both cables, as micro USB is probably going to be used by every other gadget and accessory you own for the next few years..
