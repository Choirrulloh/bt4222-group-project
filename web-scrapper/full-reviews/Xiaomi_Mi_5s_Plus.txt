Esto también se puede leer en español.. Xiaomi's Mi 5s Plus is a dual-camera phone with a big screen and battery. If the Mi 5s is too small, then Xiaomi's second 5.7-inch phone may be just the thing.. by September 28, 2016 8:22 AM PDT. Key features Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor 4GB or 6GB RAM, 64GB or 128GB onboard storage 13-megapixel dual rear cameras 3,800mAh battery. The Mi 5s Plus features dual-cameras.. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi's third big-screen phone, after the Mi Not e and Mi Max , is the Mi 5s Plus. But don't let the name deceive you -- the Mi 5s Plus feels more like a successor to the Mi Note, which was due a refresh this year.. Sporting the same 5.7-inch display size as the Mi Note, the Mi 5s Plus comes with a few upgrades not found on the Note, including a fingerprint sensor on the rear, dual cameras and a much bigger 3,800mAh battery.. Similar to the Huawei P9 , the Mi 5s Plus' dual 13-megapixel cameras feature a normal color sensor and a black-and-white one, which then combines both images for a more detailed image with less noise.. Like the Mi 5s, the Plus sports the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor. Depending on which version you get, it will either come with 6GB RAM and 128GB of onboard storage or 4GB RAM and 64GB storage.. While the phone's currently limited to China, expect it to be sold in markets such as India and Singapore in the near future. It will retail for 2,299 yuan (approximately $345, £265 or AU$450) for the lower specced model and 2,599 yuan (about $390, £300 or AU$510) for the 6GB RAM version.. I'll be looking forward to see if the cameras on the Plus are as good as Huawei's P9, so do check back in the future for our review. In the meantime, here's a quick breakdown of the specs..

Reporting Bugs DO NOT Report bugs if you're running a custom kernel or you installed Xposed. Grab a logcat right after the problem has occurred. ( Please include at least a few pages of the log, not just the last few lines, unless you know what you're doing. If it is a random reboot, grab /sys/fs/pstore/console-ramoops and /sys/fs/pstore/dmesg-ramoops-0. (Do not bother getting a logcat unless you can get it just before the reboot. A logcat after a reboot is useless). If the problem disappears after running "setenforce 0" from a root shell, grab /data/misc/audit/audit.log. Remember to provide as much info as possible.

Obviously not a lot has been ported to Lineage so please don't report issues like: "broken buttons backlight". That will be ported over soon (TM). Also you need custom TWRP build to install these packages, you can find link in the OP. BTW: You might have to force reboot after the gapps installation is complete as the unofficial installer is bit buggy ( you can do that by holding power, vol down ). Also it doesn't support addon.d so it doesn't persist when updating to next builds..

Xiaomi's Mi 5s and Mi 5s Plus laugh at your flagship's specs. The Mi 5s Plus is Xiaomi's first dual-camera flagship. 5s Plus currently the most powerful out there. mi 5s , mi 5s plus , Mobile , Tech , Xiaomi , xiaomi mi 5s , xiaomi mi 5s plus. By Stan Schroeder 2016-09-27 09:56:39 UTC. Xiaomi, the Chinese company that makes phones with specs that top Samsung and Apple flagships, and then sells them at half the price, is at it again.. The company just launched two new phones in China: The Mi 5s and the Mi 5s Plus. The phones are an obvious answer to the iPhone — both are very, very powerful devices, but the 5s Plus is bigger and has a dual camera.. SEE ALSO: Xiaomi Mi 5 is a flagship smartphone with a really low price. As you might imagine, the specs on these things are top notch. The Xiaomi Mi 5s has a 5.15-inch, Full HD screen, a 2.15GHz Snapdragon 821 chip, 3/4GB of RAM and 64/128GB of storage.. It also has a fingerprint scanner has a 12-megapixel rear camera, and a 4-megapixel selfie cam with an f/2.0 aperture and 2-micron pixels.. #Mi5s new Xiaomi flagship: ultra-large camera sensor with 1.55um pixels, ultrasonic under-glass fingerprint sensor, 600-nit display, SD821 pic.twitter.com/BChcE3OGgP. — Hugo Barra (@hbarra) September 27, 2016. The price is RMB 1,999 or $300 for the 3GB/64GB variant, while the 4GB/128GB version costs RMB 2,299 or $345.. As for the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus, it is, on paper, currently the most powerful smartphone out there. It has a 5.7-inch, Full HD screen, a 2.35GHz Snapdragon 821 chip, 4/6GB of RAM, 64/128GB of storage, and a fingerprint scanner.. It also has a Sony-made, dual, 13-megapixel camera on the back, the setup being similar to the dual-camera setup on the Huawei P9 — one camera takes color snaps and the other monochrome for increased sharpness. The selfie cam on the front is also a 4-megapixel one.. #Mi5sPlus Xiaomi’s first dual-camera flagship, 2x13MP w/ dedicated monochrome sensor, 6GB RAM + 128GB Flash, SD821 164,000 AnTuTu score pic.twitter.com/zkJcaUnDxi. — Hugo Barra (@hbarra) September 27, 2016. The price for the 4GB/64GB variant is RMB 2299 ($345), while the 6GB/128GB version costs RMB 2,599 ($390).. While the spec sheet for both devices reads great (especially considering the price), there's more technical wizardry going on there that's not immediately apparent.. For example, the fingerprint sensor on the Mi 5s is ultrasonic and placed under glass, which should theoretically mean it will not wear out with use. And the dual camera on the Mi 5s Plus sits flush with the phone's back, unlike the one on the iPhone 7 Plus. Interestingly, the sensor on the Mi 5s — Sony's IMX378 1/2.3" CMOS sensor with 1.55um pixels — is more advanced than the 13-megapixel sensors on the Mi 5s Plus.. Design-wise, the phones aren't far off their predecessor, the Mi 5. Both have an aluminum body and a curvy back; the Plus has a round fingerprint sensor nested below the dual rear camera, while the Mi 5s's back is clean save for the camera sensor and the antenna lines.. There's no jet black (or any sort of black) option, however — an odd omission from Xiaomi which takes pride in following in Apple's footsteps (and sometimes being a step ahead, as well).. The phones will be available in four colors: gold, rose gold, silver and white, and will go on sale starting Sept. There's no word on international availability..

Pros: Very good phone and after a few days use is living up to the enthusiastic reviews of it you can find on technet and elsewhere. The best and slickest phone I have had, which, taking into account how phones have improved over the years, at the time I had it and until now was an iphone 3gs. I\'m particularly impressed with the fingerprint recognition which, once you\'ve scanned your print in, unlocks the phone instantaneously and seems to cope with a bit of moisture too. Excellent price, even for this way of buying, as was on Flash sale. The new C type charging port/cable, although better overall, will likely cause occasional inconvenience until they are commonplace. A little bit disappointed there\'s no SD card slot (I must have read it doesn\'t have one but had forgotten that it doesn\'t by the time it arrived) but with 64gb built in I should be fine..

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed.

Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better!

This will be the successor to the original Mi Note from January 2015, so it goes without saying that it's hotly anticipated. The phablet has so far been rumored to sport a bezel-less curved 5.7" touchscreen, and high-end specs all-round. The Mi Note 2 is said to be powered by the Snapdragon 821 chipset, with at least two hardware versions - one of which will boast 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, t ... he other making that 6GB and 128GB, respectively. This top of the line model could even get 256GB of internal space instead of 128, as well as QHD screen resolution (while the entry-level variant will settle for 1080p). On the other hand, the high-end Mi Note 2 variation is shaping up to become the most expensive Xiaomi phone ever sold, if a new rumor out of China is to be believed. This claims that the image you see above is a leaked slide from Xiaomi's presentation of the Mi Note 2. And that big number in the middle represents the price - CNY 5,699, equating to $845 or €769 at the current exchange rates. Compared to previous Xiaomi offerings that's quite a lot, but then again the 128GB iPhone 7 Plus is $869 in the US. If this pricing turns out to be true, and that's a big if, then Xiaomi clearly wants to leave behind the affordable days for its Mi line. We assume Redmi devices will still be cheap, but the Mi Note 2 could step into premium pricing territory. We'll have to see how well it will do, sales-wise, provided this actually happens. The purported leaked slide also reveals that the Mi Note 2 is set to go on sale in China on November 1 at 10 AM..

(4GB / 128GB / 2.15GHz) ¥2699. Xiaomi announced two new flagship smartphones today. The Mi 5s and Mi 5s Plus are updates to the Mi 5 / Mi 5 Pro and Mi 5 Plus phones that were announced at MWC 2016 in February, and pack some new hardware inside a new brushed-aluminum chassis.. Both the Mi 5s and Mi 5s Plus use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 SoC , which itself is an updated version of the popular Snapdragon 820 that’s inside the Mi 5 phones and many of the other flagship phones we’ve seen this year. With Snapdragon 821, max frequencies increase to 2.34GHz for the two Kryo CPU cores in the performance cluster and 2.19GHz for the two Kryo cores in the power cluster. The Mi 5s uses the lower-binned version of the 821 that limits peak CPU frequencies to 2.15GHz and 2.00GHz, respectively. Complementing the quad-core CPU is Qualcomm’s Adreno 530 GPU that also sees a small 5% increase in peak frequency to 653MHz in the Mi 5s Plus. While it’s unclear if the 821 includes any changes to its micro-architecture, Qualcomm has likely done some layout optimization as it’s quoting a 5% increase in power efficiency. The Mi 5s and Mi 5s Plus still pair the SoC with LPDDR4 RAM and UFS 2.0 NAND like their predecessors.. The Mi 5s still comes with a 5.15-inch 1080p IPS LCD. This is an extended color gamut panel that will display exceptionally vivid, but inaccurate, colors. Xiaomi claims the display will reach a peak brightness of 600 nits, which it achieves by increasing the number of LEDs in the backlight assembly from the typical 12 to 14 in most edge-lit IPS displays to 16, a feature also shared with the Mi 5. This improves power efficiency by 17%, according to Xiaomi, presumably from using more LEDs at lower individual output levels. The Mi 5s Plus has a larger 5.7-inch 1080p IPS display with a pixel density of 386ppi, which is still decent for an LCD, and a claimed brightness of 550 nits. It's also an extended color gamut panel, but Xiaomi includes an sRGB display mode and. the ability to adjust the white point for both the Mi 5s and Mi 5s Plus.. While the front camera still uses a 4MP sensor with large 2.0μm pixels, both new phones receive new rear cameras. The Mi 5s looks to improve low-light performance by using a larger format Sony IMX378 Exmor RS sensor that features 1.55µm pixels; however, image resolution drops to 12MP, the same as Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and Apple’s iPhone 7. The Mi 5s Plus has the more interesting camera setup, employing dual 13MP sensors. Similar to Huawei’s P9 and Honor 8, the Mi 5s Plus uses one sensor for capturing color images and the other sensor for capturing black and white images. The black and white camera lacks an RGB Bayer filter, allowing it to capture more light than a color camera. By combining the output of both sensors, the Mi 5s Plus can theoretically capture brighter images with higher contrast and less noise. The P9 and Honor 8 also use the second camera for measuring depth, aiding camera focusing and allowing the user to adjust bokeh effects after the image is captured, but it’s not clear if the Mi 5s Plus also has these capabilities.. The other big change is a completely new chassis made entirely from brushed aluminum. The back edges are still curved, but there’s no longer any glass or ceramic on the back like the Mi 5 and Mi 5 Pro, respectively. The change to aluminum means the Mi 5s now includes plastic antenna lines on the top and bottom of the back panel. The Mi 5s Plus goes a different route by using plastic inserts at the top and bottom that try to blend in by mimicking the color and texture of the surrounding aluminum.. The Mi 5s Plus includes a circular, capacitive fingerprint sensor on the back that’s slightly recessed, making it easier to locate. The Mi 5s goes the less conventional route with an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor that sits below the edge-to-edge cover glass on the front. Both phones use capacitive buttons rather than onscreen navigation controls and 2.5D cover glass that blends into a chamfered edge on the aluminum frame.. Both phones come in four different colors—silver, gray, gold, and pink—and will be available for sale in China starting September 29..

The 5S has the SoC at up to 2.15GHz and the GPU at 624MHz so very SD820 like. The 5S 4GB also has pressure touch. Dimensions and most specs (use Google Translate): http://www.mi.com/mi5s/ http://www.mi.com/mi5splus/. Daniel Egger - Tuesday, September 27, 2016 - link. WTH? It's heavier AND bulkier than the predecessor and that all for a measly 200mAh battery bump?. YYN - Tuesday, September 27, 2016 - link. It could also be a new sub-frame, since the Mi 5 is really easy to bend and break. vaporcobra - Wednesday, September 28, 2016 - link. Sigh...I suspect you also probably complain when phone manufacturers make phones thinner and lighter at the expense of battery capacity. Daniel Egger - Wednesday, September 28, 2016 - link. My position on battery is and always was pretty clear: I'll take whatever provides enough charge for 7 or more days of use. My point is something completely different though: One of the USP of the Mi5 was how light it is -- also compared to the competition. The Mi5s is being advertised (and presented by AT) as being an all-around slight improvement to the Mi5, however is it both bulkier and much heavier which is a clear anti-improvement. Shadow7037932 - Wednesday, September 28, 2016 - link. What are you? A wimp? Can't handle a few grams in increased weight?. negusp - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link. Ro_Ja - Thursday, September 29, 2016 - link. My Huawei Y6 Pro is even heavier than these and you complain about a few grams eh?. SquarePeg - Tuesday, September 27, 2016 - link.

Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus: Hands-on with the chinese Pixel Phone. Google Pixel XL review: A top smartphone for an iPhone price. Xiaomi Mi Note 2: price, release and. Xiaomi is known for selling smartphones with top hardware at a bargain price. Although Xiaomi smartphones are not officially available in the US, they can be bought through importers. We have a 5.7-inch Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus and can show you in this first hands-on look at what the Chinese smartphone can offer, and whether it might be an alternative to the Google Pixel XL.. Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus release date and price. It is not so easy to get a Xiaomi smartphone in the US. You can't just go to the nearest electronics store or network supplier shop and buy one. The only way to get a Xiaomi smartphone is to either fly to China and buy the smartphone yourself, or to opt to use an importer, such as Trading Shenzhen, which kindly provided the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus that we have.. In China, the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus is offered in two different memory combinations. The cheapest version, with a price of 2,299 yuan (about $399) is equipped with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal memory. If that is not enough, there is an option with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal memory. That version costs 2,599 yuan in China (about $383).. The prices for the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus are higher in the US, of course. For example, the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal memory costs $429 from nis-store.com, while the version with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal memory costs $499 .. Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus design and build quality. The back side is made out of aluminum instead of glass. There's also a headphone jack available. The Mi 5s is very well-crafted. In the Mi 5s Plus, Xiaomi has made a few design details different from those of the Mi 5 presented at. Details such as: the camera and fingerprint sensor have been offset, and the back is now no longer made of glass but from brushed aluminum.. The numerous design changes will not be noticed by everyone, but anyone who already has had a Mi 5 will immediately recognize the change in design and craftsmanship. For example, the fingerprint sensor was moved from the front to the back of the device. This makes the Xiaomi 5s Plus more like a Huawei smartphone than a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.. The similarity of the Mi 5s to the Huawei can also be noted in the material used for the housing. The back side is no longer made of Gorilla Glass but aluminum instead. At the same time, Xiaomi has made sure that almost the whole case has been milled from one. For the numerous antennas for GSM, NFC, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, narrow plastic tapes have been inserted into the housing frame and two narrow zones on the upper and lower sections of the back side.. Overall, the craftsmanship of the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus is at a very high level and can compete with that of Samsung, Huawei. The volume rocker and the on and off button. are fit onto the right edge of the smartphone and the dual SIM card slide is set on the left edge. Only a slight difference was noticeable between the color of the SIM card slide and the rest of the housing on our gold-colored Mi 5s Plus.. The display is good, but not constantly convincing. The display of the Xiaomi "phablet" is possibly its only weak point because.. Like the Huawei Mate 8, Xiaomi has limited the Mi 5s Plus to a liquid crystal display with full HD resolution. Considering the forthcoming Mi Note 2, the choice of the display is quite wise, as both smartphones belong to the phablet category and offer similar hardware equipment. So, if you're looking for a cheap yet powerful phablet, you can take advantage of the Mi 5s Plus. Additionally, if a dual-edge display and 2K resolution is required, take a look at the Mi Note 2, which was unveiled. Just because the 5.7-inch display resolves with a maximum 1024 x 1920 pixels doesn't mean that it is bad. Despite the low pixel density of 386 ppi in comparison to other top smartphones, the pictures, videos, and even games appear very sharp, and the colors are crisp for a screen with an LCD panel. Unfortunately, the maximum brightness level of the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus is somewhat weak in comparison to top smartphones by other manufacturers.. The Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus comes from the factory with MIUI 8 already pre-installed. This firmware by Xiaomi is based on Android 6.0.1 and is very much geared toward the preferences of the Chinese home market. An app drawer does not exist; all apps are stored on the home screens. because there is no Google Play Store in China. A post-install with an APK is possible so that the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus can be equipped with all the apps from the Play Store.. The innovations in MIUI 8, compared to the 7 series, are very extensive and we couldn't detail all of them in our hands-on. We will provide more details in our final test.. Another drawback: Xiaomi smartphones support only English and Chinese languages. This was also the case with our test specimen. But the very large Xiaomi community. is already working on a MIUI 8 firmware that includes the Google Play Store for the Mi 5s Plus, so that you can install a firmware with english language later.. There's still room for improvement in the benchmarks. In terms of performance, the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus is at the same level as the Google Pixel XL, which costs up to $869. As in the Google phone, the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus also features Qualcomm's latest processor, the Snapdragon 821 with the Adreno 530 GPU. Furthermore, our test device had 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal memory. All of that should theoretically be enough to run the Google Pixel XL into the ground.. In the first benchmark run, the Mi 5s Plus can't outrun the Google Pixel XL despite 6 GB of RAM. Whether this is necessarily due to the Android 7.1 Nougat on the Google Pixel XL, or because of a slower internal memory, must be determined in our final review.. We've already noted the similarities in design to Huawei smartphones. The similarities continue in the main camera. Like the Huawei P9 and P9 Plus, the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus also features a dual camera setup consisting of a color and a monochrome image sensor.. Of course, despite this similarity, there are also some differences. First in the resolution, because the image sensors of the Mi 5s Plus shoot photos with a maximum of 13 megapixels and with 1.12 µm. Thus, the pixels of the camera in the Xiaomi are smaller than in the Huawei P9. Conversely, the camera of the Mi 5s Plus has a larger aperture (f/2.0 instead of f/2.2).. At first glance, the front camera with 4 megapixels does not promise quality selfies, but the pixel size is quite large at 2 µm. In synergy with the f/2.0 aperture, this could point to good picture quality in bad lighting conditions.. Based on pure data, the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus promises to be a good camera smartphone, but we have to discuss and test it extensively before making a final test report.. The energy storage of the Mi 5s Plus is rated at 3800 mAh and is thus larger than that of the Galaxy S7 Edge (3600 mAh) or the Google Pixel XL (3450 mAh). But the capacity of a Huawei Mate 9, which has a 4000 mAh battery, relegates the Mi 5s Plus as insufficient.. However, the pure capacity specification does not tell us anything about how long the smartphone can last under everyday use, and under extreme stress. Because the Mi 5s Plus comes with the latest processor, the Snapdragon 821 – just like the Google Pixel XL – it could overcome its low capacity to leave the Huawei Mate 8 behind. In the final tests, we'll provide you with the theory of the data.. Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus technical specifications. 154.6 x 77.7 x 8 mm. 1920 x 1080 pixels (386 ppi). HSPA, LTE, NFC, Dual-SIM , Bluetooth 4.2. If you ignore the usual points of criticism for an imported device – questionable warranty, no factory support for the local language and, where appropriate, long delivery times – then the Mi 5s Plus offers a top product for very little money. The Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus even has the technological potential to be a top smartphone threat. You will learn whether the Xiaomi phablet really meets these high expectations in our final review. But the signs already look good.. I wonder when will xiaomi manufacture a compact phone that could eventually fight on apple's iPhone 5S and SE. Come on Xiaomi I believe in you.. What happened to a full review? thanks. 4 flagship phones in 4 months......i dont understand wat the hell the r doing....disgusting.

At its press event in Beijing, Xiaomi released the latest generation of its flagship family, and keeping up with a long and storied tradition, the new Mi 5s and Mi 5s Plus deliver excellent specs at very reasonable prices.. Don’t miss: Xiaomi Mi 5 review. Despite their “s” designation, the Xiaomi Mi 5s and Mi 5s Plus feature a different design when compared to the Mi 5, which was released earlier this year. The Mi 5s is the smaller, lower-spec’ed device, at 5.15 inches, while the 5s Plus boasts a 5.7-inch display and a feature set that can compete with any device out there.. Both phones are made of aluminum, with a couple of cosmetic and functional differences: namely, the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus lacks the antenna lines of the Mi 5s, and features a rear mounted fingerprint sensor, instead of a frontal one.. The fingerprint sensor on the Xiaomi Mi 5s is one of the highlights of the device, as this is one of the first examples of an under-glass fingerprint solution on a smartphone. The device still features an indentation in the glass to give users tactile feedback about the position of the reader, but the reader itself is placed beneath the cover glass.. We’re looking at Qualcomm’s ultrasonic fingerprint reader , dubbed Sense ID. LG, Synaptics, and other component makers have their own under-glass sensor solutions.. The prices of the Xiaomi Mi 5s and Mi 5s Plus are in line with previous devices in the series. While the Chinese prices are often lower than the prices of Xiaomi devices in India and other markets, they’re still a good indicator of what to expect. The Xiaomi Mi 5s and Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus will be available in China from Thursday, September 29, in dark grey (brushed metal), gold (brushed metal), silver (matte), or pink (matte). No word yet on the eventual availability of the two devices in other markets, but we expect separate announcements in the close future.. What do you think of the new Xiaomi Mi 5s and Mi 5s Plus?.
