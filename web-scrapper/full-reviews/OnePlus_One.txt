The first phone from Chinese company OnePlus is a high-end Cyanogen-powered device for $299. Following an intense campaign of online hype, OnePlus announced the OnePlus One on April 23, 2014. The OnePlus One is a 5.5-inch smartphone with high-end internals — a Snapdragon 801 CPU, 3GB of RAM, 1080p display and 13-megapixel Sony camera — with a highly competitive price point of $299 for the 16GB model. Black and white colors are available, along with a range of customizable textures to choose from, including denim and Kevlar.. On the software side, the OnePlus One runs CyanogenMod 11S, based on Android 4.4 KitKat. The new version of what was once just a custom ROM for Android phones introduces a new, flattened UI and updated camera and gallery apps with enhanced features. One of the biggest changes in CM 11S is the completely rewritten theme engine, which lets users pick-and-choose which parts of themes they want to apply to completely customize their experience.. Launch markets for the OnePlus One include Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, UK and the USA, though you'll need an invite to purchase the device. OnePlus also regularly offers contests and other ways to get a chance to buy the OnePlus One.. A phone with top-notch specs and user experience doesn't have to cost you an arm and a leg.

CNET también está disponible en español.. A high-end smartphone for Android experts. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The OnePlus One has a sleek design that comfortably fits in your pocket, and the phone's powerful specs deliver a smooth, lag-free performance for a relatively low price.. The Bad The 5.5-inch display is too wide to use with one hand, and the Android-based CyanogenMod operating system isn't very stable at the moment. The camera is mediocre, and audio volume during calls is too soft. Its 4G radio won't work on every network.. The Bottom Line Though it's one of this year's better Android phones on paper, the OnePlus One isn't for everyone, nor is it readily available.. The new volume rocker is shorter but more clickable. The soft-touch rear gives the phone a good grip. 4G LTE Software and features. The OnePlus One has plenty of promise, and it doesn't disappoint. For a non-contract, SIM-free price of $299 (around £180 or AU$320) for the 16GB version and $349 (roughly £210 or AU$380) for the 64GB model, the Android-powered smartphone is one of the best deals you can get today. It's a terrific price for a 4G phone, especially if you don't need the fancy features found on the $700 HTC One M8 or the $600 Samsung Galaxy S5 .. Yet there are some significant "buts" in this proposition. Getting your hands on a One is harder than you'd think. Ahead of a release that's set for sometime in June , OnePlus is selling the phone only via an odd invite system. Furthermore, you can buy it only on the OnePlus website , so you won't have the opportunity to get a test it in a shop. After-sale support is all online, too, which may be a problem given its rather unstable software. Furthermore, its 4G LTE works only on specific bands, meaning it may not function with your carrier.. All of these things make the One best for an experienced Android fan who wants as much freedom as the OS can bring -- and is willing to put in the effort to own it.. Still, in the highly competitive Chinese smartphone market, it could be that these low-cost marketing tactics will help OnePlus build awareness of its brand against heavyweights such as Xiaomi or Huawei. But at the end of day, it's the quality and performance of the One that will entice buyers, and fortunately, that's where this smartphone excels.. The OnePlus One is a tasty $299 Android smartphone (pictures). The design of the OnePlus One was instantly familiar, and after looking through my pictures of the Oppo Find 7 , it appears the phones are practically siblings -- only a few details such as the button layout and placement of the volume jack differ. That makes perfect sense, since OnePlus is part-owned by Oppo, and the One is made at Oppo's facilities.. The 5.5-inch, full-HD display, which has a resolution of 1,920x1,080 pixels, is bright and vibrant and is usable even under bright sunlight at noon. Weighing in at 160g, the handset felt light despite its size. That said, I found it a little too wide to use with one hand -- a 5-inch display is still my ideal size for one-handed operation.. Like the Find 7, the OnePlus One sports a slightly curved top and bottom. The power button is located on the right side, while the volume rockers are located on the left. When I tested an earlier prototype, the slim buttons were pretty hard to press. While the review unit's rockers are shorter in length, they're actually more clickable and easier to work with.. Instead of having the screen cover the entire front of the phone, the glass ends just slightly before the edges at the top and bottom. This exposes the silvery plastic below it, and I confess I'm not exactly fond of this design. It does catch the eye, but I have a feeling dirt is likely to accumulate at the edges, and it feels strange to touch, due to its having two edges instead of just one.. The OnePlus One has a soft-touch plastic rear, and it feels great. The curved edges mean nothing sharp digs into your palm when you're holding it, and the phone feels balanced and not the least bit unwieldy.. There are three touch-sensitive buttons located below the screen, but you can disable these and use onscreen keys if you prefer. When turned off, you can't see the buttons except under bright sunlight.. Unfortunately, you don't get a lot of exterior choices on the smartphone. The 3,100mAh battery isn't removable, and there's no micro-SD card slot located underneath. As such, you have to choose between getting the 16GB model or the 64GB version. With the more capacious model only $50 more (most phonemakers put a much bigger markup on extra storage), it's clearly the better deal.. The One is powered by a 2.5GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor and a generous 3GB of RAM, putting in the top tier of mobile power. More on that in the Performance section, below.. It has LTE support for some US (AT&T and T-Mobile) and UK networks (EE and Three), as well as some in Europe -- but not all. This is potentially a major downside, especially as you can't try it out before paying for it. My advice would be to look at this list of 4G LTE networks , see which band your carrier uses, and compare it to this list of bands the One supports: 1, 3, 4, 7, 17, 38, and 40.. It's not as though it won't be able to make calls if it doesn't support your network's band, but you won't get the benefit of the fast data speeds you're paying for. Besides 4G, it has quad-band 3G, NFC, Bluetooth, and dual-band Wi-Fi.. The OnePlus One runs modders' favorite CyanogenMod 11S, which is based on Android KitKat 4.4. It's very similar to stock Android , but with a few modifications. These include an expanded desktop mode, and the ability to use gestures to turn on the camera or the LED light when the display is turned off. Other interesting tweaks include a voice-activated wake-up, and themes that let you really customise how the UI looks.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

The OnePlus One (colloquially abbreviated to OPO ) is an Android smartphone manufactured by OnePlus. Unveiled in April 2014, it is the first product by OnePlus. The One was designed to compare favorably – in performance, quality, and price – to flagship devices by leading smartphone manufacturers. The One shipped to most markets with the Cyanogen OS operating system pre-installed. Cyanogen OS is a commercial variant of CyanogenMod .. The phone was first made available for sale on 25 April 2014, exclusively from the OnePlus website, but initially required prospective customers to obtain an invitation before they could purchase it. These invitations were primarily distributed by the company through contests, some of which attracted attention for their unconventional or controversial nature. On 6 June 2014, the device was available for general sale. As of 20 April 2015, the device no longer required an invite to purchase. 2 Release and distribution. The OnePlus company was founded on 16 December 2013 by former Oppo president Pete Lau. The company's main goal was to design his "dream" smartphone; one that would balance the quality of high-end devices from its major competitors with a lower price than other phones in its class. He argued that, despite their lower cost, users would "never settle" for the lower-quality devices produced by other Chinese companies, and similar startups such as Blu and Yota. [7] [8] Lau compared the ideals of OnePlus with those of the Japanese company Muji , with a focus on high quality products with simplistic designs. [7] The company's primary cost-cutting measure was a decision to exclusively sell the device online, rather than at retail or through wireless carriers, citing the success of a similar online sales model for Nexus devices. [8] Continuing Lau's association with the platform from the Oppo N1 , [8] OnePlus entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Cyanogen Inc. to base its product's Android software upon Cyanogen OS, a commercial variant of the popular custom ROM CyanogenMod, and use its trademarks outside China. The OnePlus One was officially unveiled on 23 April 2014 for a limited release on 25 April: described as a "flagship killer", its prices were set at US$299 and US$349 for the 16. GB models respectively—which one critic estimated was roughly half the price of the then recently unveiled Samsung Galaxy S5. The device is sold online exclusively through the OnePlus website. Stock of the device was previously limited through an invite system ; the company had made the device available for purchase without an invitation during special promotions, however, such as on Black Friday , and in December 2014 for the holiday shopping season. [12] On 9 February 2015, OnePlus announced that it would begin to hold such open sales every Tuesday. [13] In an announcement on 20 April 2015 marking the one-year anniversary of its release, OnePlus announced that the One would be available without an invite "forever", but hinted that the requirement may return for its successor. Co-founder Carl Pei explained that "by rigorously testing and improving our logistical structure over the last one year, we are far more confident that our processes have matured enough for us to handle the increased production and after-sales support that comes along with opening up sales. It's what we've been working towards, and now we're ready." [6]. Invites were first given out through a promotion known as "Smash the Past", in which 100 users would be selected to win an opportunity to purchase a 16. GB OnePlus One for only $1, along with three invites they can give to friends, if they record a video of themselves breaking their previous phone. Some users misinterpreted the promotion, however, and prematurely posted videos on YouTube of them breaking their phones. [14] [15] Users were later not required to destroy their phones, and could instead donate them to the charity Medic Mobile. OnePlus launched a second contest, "Ladies First", on 12 August 2014, inviting women to take photos of themselves holding the OnePlus logo or having drawn it on their bodies, with the winners decided by a vote receiving an invite to buy the One, and a OnePlus T-shirt. The promotion was met with controversy, as others felt that the contest promoted the objectification of women : some users posted entries that consisted of existing photos of women with OnePlus logos edited onto them, while another posted a picture of herself performing middle finger gestures, accompanied by a comment denouncing the contest as sexist. [17] In response to the criticism, the contest was pulled only hours after it was announced: the company stated that "we want to encourage even more women to get involved with and excited about the amazing things happening in tech right now. The 'Ladies First' contest was a very misguided effort by a few isolated employees to do just that, however there is no question the post not only failed to better include our female community but actually perpetuated a stereotype that OnePlus in no way supports or condones." [17] On 25 August 2014, OnePlus began a summer-themed photography coverage as a replacement, giving away 10,000 invites. In December 2014, the One was released in India exclusively through Amazon ; invites were still necessary to purchase the device outside special promotions, which have been held occasionally since its launch. [19] OnePlus also announced plans to establish a presence in the country, with plans to open 25 official walk-in service centres across India. In August 2015, nearly 18 months after its release, the One was officially released in the United Arab Emirates exclusively through a local online retailer souq.com. Customers can purchase the phone without the need of an invite. Sales of the OnePlus One in India were temporarily halted following a temporary injunction granted to Micromax Mobile , alleging that the sale of the device in India violated its exclusive rights to distribute Cyanogen-branded products in South Asia—an agreement announced in November 2014 as part of a new joint venture, YU , [22] and that its agreement superseded the agreement Cyanogen Inc. The company disputed the arguments, noting that its Cyanogen-based software was different than that of Micromax's, and argued that the exclusivity agreement only meant that Cyanogen could not partner with any other company based in India, and did not inhibit the ability for OnePlus to market its products in the country with its trademarks. In response to the partnership, OnePlus had already begun the development of a new, in-house Android distribution, known as "OxygenOS", which it planned to replace CyanogenMod with for the device that the company planned via software updates to models distributed in India, along with a version for Chinese models known as "H2OS". [20] [24] [25] On 25 December 2014, the court reversed the sales ban, noting that YU and OnePlus were within different market segments—low-end and high-end devices respectively. The device's internal hardware includes a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 system-on-chip clocked at 2.5. GB of RAM, and a 5.5-inch, JDI 1080p IPS LCD display. It includes either 16 or 64. [7] Its rear-facing camera features a 13 megapixel, Sony -manufactured Exmor IMX214 sensor , alongside a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. [7] The OnePlus One supports LTE networks using bands 1, 3, 4, 7, 17, 38, and 40. Due to the company's startup stature, only one model of the device was released worldwide, without any additional regional SKUs like other smartphones. The chassis of the OnePlus One is constructed from magnesium , and is accompanied by a curved, textured rear cover in either black or white. Special denim , Kevlar , and bamboo wood covers were also unveiled as accessories, but the bamboo covers were temporarily cancelled due to quality issues. [7] [29] [30] The device features capacitive navigation keys, but they can be disabled in favor of customizable navigation keys rendered on-screen. [7] [31] Anandtech characterized its design as being a "close cousin" to the Oppo Find 7 A. Outside China, the OnePlus One shipped with CyanogenMod 11S, based on Android 4.4.4 "KitKat". The latest version of CyanogenMod 11S is 11.0-XNPH05Q. In China, OnePlus One ships with Oppo's ColorOS distribution, based on Android 4.3 "Jelly Bean". [7] Alongside additional features added to the Android platform through Cyanogen (including wider customization options, an audio equalizer, encrypted messaging, and application privacy controls), the 11S software adds persistent voice commands, and gestures that can be performed while the phone is in standby to perform various functions, such as double-tapping the screen to turn it on, drawing a circle to go to the camera, and drawing a "V" to activate flashlight mode. An upgrade to Cyanogen OS 12.0, based on Android 5.0.2 "Lollipop" was released for all OnePlus One devices outside China on 14 April 2015. The latest version of Cyanogen OS for this phone is 13.1.2-ZNH2KAS3P0-bacon based on Android Marshmallow 6.0.1(AOSP), released in August 2016. This brings latest September Security Patches for Android and improves the deep integration of "Cortana"-Microsoft's Digital Assistant into Cyanogen OS due to strategic partnership between Microsoft and Cyanogen; Microsoft also being an important investor in the company. [20] [33] [34] [35] [36] Two in-house Lollipop-based distributions, OxygenOS and HydrogenOS, were released earlier, on 4 April 2015, outside and inside China respectively. [37] On 9 April 2016, OnePlus One devices running Cyanogen OS started receiving Cyanogen OS 13.0.1 based on Android Marshmallow 6.0.1. Team Cyanogen started rolling out Cyanogen OS 13.1 on 10 June 2016. [38] CyanogenOS 13.1 for OnePlus One includes mods for Skype, OneNote, Microsoft Hyperlapse and an updated Cortana mod. The OnePlus One has received a positive reception, not withstanding occasional technical issues and lack of support. There was much praise for the One's hardware, shared with contemporary devices that often cost up to twice as much. Tests found that the One usually performed as well as or even better despite being half the price of its rivals, not only due to its specs but also attributed to its largely bloatware-free CyanogenMod OS. In addition, its CyanogenMod operating system offers more customization options than stock Android albeit being less stable. The One was generally considered superior to its closest competition. The similarly-priced Nexus 5 was more widely available and had more guaranteed updates from Google, however it suffered from some design compromises including mediocre battery life and camera quality to keep the price low, plus its internal hardware was aging. In terms of specifications and size, the OnePlus One could be compared to the much pricier 5.5-inch LG G3 whose screen was higher resolution but inferior quality. Similar to the Google Nexus line of devices, the One has expanded the trend of high spec but mid-priced Android devices; by 2015 when the succeeding OnePlus 2 was released there was competition from numerous affordable flaghips including the Moto X Pure and Asus ZenFone 2. The OnePlus One's original distribution via an invite-only order system made the device difficult to acquire, so some reviewers decided against recommending it. As of the end of 2014, the OnePlus One has sold over one million units, despite only planning to sell up to 50,000 units. [39] [40] The East Asian market accounted for 39% of the company's shipments in 2014, followed by Europe with 33%, 22% in North America, and 7% in India. In total, the device generated a total revenue of $300 million through December 2014. ^ "Information: OnePlus One ("bacon")". ^ via Amazon India. ^ Zimmerman, Steven (12 October 2016).

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Here's why OnePlus One equals 4.5. The OnePlus One offers Samsung Galaxy S5 performance for less than half the price. If that doesn't make it attractive it also has a customisable OS and a 1080p display. There are a few downsides, but overall the OnePlus One is amazing value for money.. The Google Nexus 4 , the Google Nexus 5 , the Motorola Moto G , and the OnePlus One; this 5.5-inch bolt from out of the blue (well, China) joins an exclusive list of smartphones that offer an awful lot of smartphone for not a lot of money.. But having used the OnePlus One, I'm wondering whether it needs to be placed in a category all of its own.. Here is a device that rivals the HTC One M8 and the Samsung Galaxy S5 for raw specs, but at a new impressively low cost of just £219, $299 (around AU$320). That's less than half the price of those aforementioned big hitters.. It can even go toe-to-toe with some of the newer flagship devices, such as the HTC One M9 , the Galaxy S6 and the Nexus 6 .. Initially you were able to order a 16GB model for £229, $299, but that option was removed for a while from the official shop. It is now back on there with a Silk White version, but if you want one, you'll need to be fast.. The company has kept the OnePlus One relatively exclusive, though over the last few months it's opened the door slightly to non-invitees. Every Tuesday, the OnePlus One becomes available for 24 hours beginning at 8 am GMT. The door promptly closes afterwards, but at least access is loosening up slightly.. You can buy the OnePlus One from other stores, with prices for the 64GB edition reaching as low as £209 (around $324, AU$441) if you shop around, though if you can we'd still recommend buying from OnePlus directly for peace of mind.. The OnePlus One's successor, the OnePlus 2 , is now official, and brings some beefed up specs for another tempting price. Although this means the OnePlus One feels slightly dated, it brings the added benefit of OnePlus lowering the price of the original even further.. Much of my early time with the OnePlus One was spent warily turning it around in my hands, like some kind of mysterious artefact of unknown origin, not quite ready to believe what was being promised of it. There has to be some compromise here, right?. But it's staggering how small they seem when weighed against that double-take-inducing price tag.. An issue to get out of the way early on is the availability of this handset. OnePlus started out with a slightly strange invite-only system, limiting the number of people who can order a handset.. It was so the startup firm can keep on top of production, but meant you had to hunt around for an invite - or try your luck with a 24 hour pre-order session the firm appears to be doing every now and then.. However since its launch the OnePlus One is now far more easy to get hold of, with the rather convoluted invite system moving over to the new OnePlus 2.. OnePlus will only ship the One to 16 countries, so if you're not in one of the following you're pretty much out of luck. Those countries are; Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and the United States.. Usually when a cheap smartphone boasts specifications that bloody the noses of the big boys, it's the design that suffers. It's far harder to make a solid, stylish, and hard-wearing mobile device than it is to throw in the latest off-the-shelf chip from Qualcomm.. However the OnePlus One is a pleasure to hold and to use. Okay, so it lacks the HTC One M9's gorgeous metallic sheen, and you won't turn any heads when you take it out of your pocket like you would with a flashy iPhone 6 Plus. But show me the phone that does.. The OnePlus One nevertheless feels great in the hand. It's primarily made up of a quality matte plastic shell that extends around the back and sides of the device. This isn't a unibody construction, and this rear panel can be removed for customisation purposes, but it's firmly fixed in place with minimal creaking or flexing.. There's a metal-effect plastic rim that separates this rear cover from the glass front, which cheapens the effect ever-so-slightly, but it's thin and unadorned. It does mean that the aforementioned glass frontage appears to stand out rather than melding into the body of the phone, but it's not an unpleasant effect.. All in all, it looks and feels like something of a cross between the Nexus 5 and the Nokia Lumia 1520 .. The OnePlus One is not a particularly slim or light device, but then nor is it an absolute brick. At 152.9 x 75.9 x 8.9mm, its dimensions make it only slightly larger than the LG G4 and Sony Xperia Z3 , the latter of which has a smaller 5.2-inch screen. What's more, the OnePlus One is three grams lighter than the Sony at 160g.. Of course, this is still a monster of a phone when you compare it to older or smaller devices. I always thought of my trusty old HTC One X as a bit of a beast, but the 4.7-inch phone feels positively dainty next to the OnePlus One. Meanwhile my iPhone 5S looked like a (rich) child's toy when held next to it.. I've mentioned it a few times now, but the OnePlus One's 5.5-inch display really is quite the specimen. At 5.5-inches it's bigger than both the One M8's and Galaxy S5's, though it has the same 1920 x 1080 Full HD resolution. Admittedly that makes it a little less pixel-dense, but with 401ppi I defy anyone to call it anything but sharp.. If you're thinking that OnePlus may have cut corners with the quality of this display, then think again. It's an IPS display, which means it's sharp and accurate even when viewed from an angle, and it's made by JDI, the company responsible for the One M8's excellent screen.. The default brightness seems a little weak, but crank it up and you'll get a picture that truly pops, with impressively deep blacks.. Perhaps the best illustration of this is to boot up the gorgeous Badlands game with its inky-black silhouettes layered over detailed amber backgrounds.. It hasn't been plain sailing for the OnePlus One's display though, with a few users taking to the web complaining of a "yellow hue" at the bottom of the screen. OnePlus sent TechRadar two handsets, and having used both I can either that neither have suffered from this issue.. Around the back of the OnePlus One is the vaguely oblong black camera element that houses the lens and dual-LED flash. This has been allowed to jut out slightly, its flat surface peeking above the curved shell. I quite liked the effect, especially in concert with the funky OnePlus One logo situated below.. OnePlus has housed a tiny pair of stereo speakers on the bottom edge of the device - as held in portrait view - with two telltale rows of machined holes either side of the microUSB port.. Button placement is strong, with the power key situated two thirds of the way up on the right hand side and the elongated volume rocker opposite on the left hand side.. This is ideal for a device as large as the OnePlus One, as they always fall under a thumb or finger, whereas a top-mounted button would have required some finger contortion to reach single-handed.. OnePlus has also included permanent capacitive hardware keys underneath the screen, which proves to be a mixed blessing. There's a menu key, a home key, and a back-up key in that order. I found it very hard to see these keys, particularly in daylight, as they don't light up very much at all.. They're also mapped a little oddly by default, with multitasking set to an awkward double-tap of the home button.. On the plus side, you don't have to use these keys at all, and you can also remap the keys to your liking. We'll discuss the OnePlus One's impressive customisation potential in greater detail over the next few sections.. Just about the only glaring weakness of the OnePlus One's external design comes in the form of its SIM tray. It looks to be made of a cheaper, rougher form of plastic, and I found the access hole to be an absolute pig to use with my iPhone tool (which I had to use as the OnePlus didn't come in its packaging).. Indeed, it seems as if this SIM accessibility was a problem for whoever used the phone before me, as the hole had a tatty and worn look to it, like it had been hand-drilled with a Black and Decker and a cheap drill bit.. This is the only external sign that you're dealing with a new manufacturer's first attempt at a high-quality smartphone.. Next Page Key features.

OnePlus One review: a $300 smartphone has never looked so good. If you can honestly admit that you love every single thing about it, I have good news: You can stop reading this review, since it won't have an impact on your happiness. But if there's even one thing you wish your smartphone could do better, it means you had to make compromises when you bought it. Everybody wants a perfect phone, but such a thing simply doesn't exist. So, we settle on a phone that has only 95 percent of the features we want, and that... OnePlus believes it doesn't have to be this way. Its motto, "Never Settle," represents the fledgling Chinese company's mission to build and sell the perfect smartphone. Its first attempt is the One , a premium-looking device that has customizable firmware and top-shelf specs. Oh, and it'll sell for $299 unlocked and free of contract, which is even less expensive than Google's Nexus 5. Seems a little over-ambitious for a small startup with no official track record, doesn't it? Let's find out if the One is too good to be true.. Gallery: OnePlus One review | 35 Photos. Firmware is as customizable as you can get. For $300, no other phone comes close to what the OnePlus One offers. Not only does it look and feel like a premium device, but it also comes with specs similar to what you'd find in a flagship smartphone. If you want a high-end phone on a budget, look no further.. Hardware Software Camera Performance and battery life The competition Wrap-up. The OnePlus One doesn't look like a $299 phone. Its arched back, polycarbonate build, elegant chassis and top-of-the-line spec sheet could easily fool someone into thinking you paid $600 for it. That's probably because a lot of other companies are trying to sell the same kind of device for that much money.. How is it possible, then, for a startup like OnePlus to sell a flagship device at a lower cost than many of its closest competitors? Easy: Use the same business model Google used with the Nexus 4 and 5. In other words, it doesn't plan to make any money for a while. OnePlus has no track record to rely on aside from the fact that its founder and much of its workforce came over from Oppo, which has a reputation for making great devices (albeit at a much higher cost). Keeping the price down is an investment for the nascent company; it's got a lot to prove, and the One is meant to be exhibit A.. There's not much to hate for a first-gen product, unless you're simply not a fan of larger smartphones. That's because the One sports a 5.5-inch display and is 1.7mm taller and 0.6mm thicker than the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. It is, however, roughly four millimeters narrower and six grams lighter than Samsung's 5.7-inch flagship. If you're not used to holding phones bigger than a Galaxy S5 or Nexus 5, you may feel like you're stretching hand muscles you never knew you had. I'm used to devices this size, however, and I found that using the OnePlus One was as pleasant an experience as you're going to get with any phone larger than 5.3 inches. It features an arched back, which makes it rest more naturally in my hands, and its blunt edges give my fingers plenty of room to rest comfortably.. Doing the calculations, the One's 5.5-inch 1080p IPS LCD panel has a pixel density of 401 ppi. The pickiest of pickies will automatically discount the quality of the screen based on the fact that it's not quite as crisp as devices like the HTC One M8 and Samsung Galaxy S5, but I'm sure you won't notice the difference. And dare I say, I actually enjoy the One's display more than most flagship smartphones, and it's leaps and bounds better than the Nexus 5. Because it uses an IPS panel, the One's viewing angles are among the best in the industry, keeping pace with the One M8 and absolutely destroying the GS5. It's not quite as bright as the GS5, but it's still respectable for a flagship-caliber device; heck, even its whites are whiter than those three other phones. Most importantly, the colors are natural, making them more satisfying to stare at than the saturated GS5 and overblown Nexus 5. In case this isn't your style, however, the firmware lets you customize the amount of color saturation, intensity and contrast.. The display rises slightly above the rest of the frame, which means it's more exposed than most smartphone screens. Fortunately it features a slab of Gorilla Glass 3 for scratch resistance, which should help for those chance encounters with keys, pens and other similar objects. There's a 5-megapixel front-facing camera near the top next to the earpiece and sensors, and you'll also find a set of three capacitive buttons at the bottom, which can be turned off in favor of virtual soft keys (more on this in the next section).. A volume rocker and micro-SIM slot line the left side of the One, while a power button adorns the right. There's a 3.5mm headphone jack on top, and you'll find twin speaker grilles flanking a micro-USB port on the bottom. Some potential buyers might complain about the lack of a microSD storage slot, but if that's really an issue, you can just spend an extra $50 for the 64GB version. This is a fantastic deal compared to other flagships that make you pay another $200 for that amount of space.. The gently curved back is minimal, featuring a 13MP camera with dual-LED flash, noise-canceling mic and logos for OnePlus and Cyanogen (unless you have the Chinese version, which doesn't have the latter). The back cover is interchangeable, which gives you the ability to customize your hardware somewhat. Five plates have been announced so far, each with different colors and/or textures, but only two will be available at launch time. You'll need the extra time to practice removing the back, though, because the process is about as painful as changing the oil in your car. To do it, you'll need to first eject the SIM tray and then, using a mixture of fingernails, luck and prayer (if that's your thing), pry open the back methodically. OnePlus made it difficult to take off on purpose, since nothing underneath the cover is removable -- not even the 3,100mAh battery. Plus, think of the fine sense of accomplishment you'll feel when you've actually succeeded.. The One will come in two variants: one for China (with Chinese-specific bands and TD-SCDMA) and another for the rest of the world. OnePlus has tried to cram as many connectivity options as possible into the One, with seven LTE bands (1, 3, 4, 7, 17, 38, 40), as well as penta-band HSPA+ (up to 42 Mbps) and quad-band GSM/EDGE. For US readers, that means you can use this on AT&T or T-Mobile, but not Verizon or Sprint. It also supports Bluetooth 4.0, USB OTG, WiFi 802.11b/g/n/ac, GPS/GLONASS and NFC. As an aside, my review unit is a white 16GB model and is a pre-production device. OnePlus reps tell me the hardware and firmware are "almost final," but improvements and bug fixes may be made between now and when the final units hit the assembly line. Once I have a final unit in my hands, I'll take another look and update my review if anything gets fixed (or broken, as it were).. Before moving on, a disclaimer: Despite the company's "Never Settle" mantra, a few of you may still feel like you'd be settling with the One. OnePlus couldn't realistically pack every possible feature that now exists into its perfect phone -- especially at such a low price -- so if you want something with wireless charging, a microSD slot, waterproof design, aluminum build or a removable battery, this may not be the perfect phone for you.. As if the One wasn't unique enough, it also comes with a much more customizable Android experience than what 99 percent of users currently enjoy. This is because OnePlus is an exclusive partner with CyanogenMod , so naturally its very first phone comes with the firmware (build 11S, based on Android 4.4.2) directly baked in.. What exactly is CyanogenMod? It's custom firmware based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and gives the user more freedom to fiddle around with settings, icons, themes and... well, nearly every aspect of the Android experience. Cyanogen's one of the most popular pieces of third-party firmware in the Android universe and can be installed a wide variety of devices, but the experience is even better on the One because it was built into the phone; since CyanogenMod could work with the hardware early in its development, it was able to add a bunch of optimizations that you won't find on other phones.. At first, it doesn't appear that different from stock Android, save for a few style changes (think: icons and buttons). But don't let its understated facade fool you: There's a lot of power behind the scenes, and it becomes more evident as you continue to poke around. There are several new features, with tweakable settings thrown in everywhere. Many of you are simply looking for an inexpensive phone and don't care about making dozens of tiny adjustments to your Android setup, and the beauty of CM is that it can fit your style just as easily as it can fit the preferences of power users -- it's completely customizable, and it's fantastic. Here's a crash course on what you can tweak.. Thanks to a healthy modding community, there are tons of different CyanogenMod themes to choose from. Prefer LG's or Samsung's interfaces for some weird reason? No sweat, just go to the Themes Showcase app and download what you want. Most of them aren't perfect ports (some only feature select parts of the UI, like icons, buttons or fonts), but they will at least offer you some of the familiarity of what you're used to. You can also choose to download a number of different fonts, sound packs, boot animations and wallpapers.. The One comes with a set of capacitive keys below the screen, but you can deactivate them and opt for a virtual bar of soft buttons instead. It may not make sense to do that if you're trying to squeeze as much real estate as possible out of your screen space, however. If you choose to keep the on-screen bar, CM will let you add, take away and rearrange the buttons that appear there.. You can also customize the status bar to show the clock, battery percentage (and the type of indicator it uses) and the number of notifications for certain apps, like Gmail. You'll also be able to adjust screen brightness just by sliding your finger to the left or right on the bar, and you can choose to add a double-tap-to-sleep option.. If you want to change which tiles show up in your quick settings menu (and the order in which they're shown), you can do that by hitting a plus icon near the top. And by the way, instead of having to use a two-finger gesture to open that menu, it's possible to pull down on the right side of the status bar to get there -- pulling down on the left would bring up the standard notification bar. Finally, you can also change which shortcuts show up on the lock screen, as well as the quick launch shortcuts that appear when you slide up from the home button. I could keep talking about more stuff you can tweak, but you get the idea -- you can do a lot. And part of the fun is discovering new settings to tweak.. The One lets you use gestures to activate different parts of the phone. Oddly, this is one of the few parts of the OS that isn't customizable. A double-tap wakes the device; a V motion activates the LED flashlight; two fingers up/down will turn on your music; and a circular gesture gets you straight into the camera. These gestures were incredibly sensitive on my pre-release unit, so I would often hear music coming from the phone as it sat in my pants pocket. Hopefully OnePlus and Cyanogen will fine-tune this as the One gets closer to an official launch. Lastly, during the course of my review I stumbled upon one of the One's best features: always-listening voice recognition, thanks to Qualcomm. CM throws in a few modifications of its own to add more customization. After the phone learns your voice, you can say "Hey Snapdragon" "OK OnePlus" to activate Google Now or any app of your choice.. The Nexus 5 has a lot of endearing traits, but the camera isn't one of them. Sure, it has its moments of greatness, but I can't help think this is a case of settling. The OnePlus One, on the other hand, uses a 13-megapixel rear camera with a Sony sensor, six-element lens setup and f/2.0 aperture for lower-light shots. Additionally, the front-facing camera tops out at 5MP -- a sizable improvement over the 1.3-megapixel sensor on the N5.. The camera app is a special flavor made by the CyanogenMod team. It consists of three circular buttons on the side for taking stills, video and panoramic shots. Along the top sits some settings, scenes and a toggle for the front-facing camera. In addition to HDR, night mode, landscape and a few other standard options, the One has less-traditional scenes like snow, sunset, party and theatre. These may offer some fun ways to experiment with your camera, but I found that auto mode took care of most scenarios perfectly well. But if you want to switch back and forth, all you have to do is swipe your finger up or down on the viewfinder.. When it comes to performance, the camera is decent, but hardly stellar. Colors appear more natural than on the Nexus 5, but they're still slightly less saturated than they should be. The sky isn't as blue as I'd like, and some of my sample images suffer from soft focus. For low-light shots, the large aperture didn't help the camera capture as much light as I expected, as the level of detail is nowhere close to what I got from the HTC One M8 or high-end Nokia Lumias. Compared to the N5, it gets about the same amount of light, but the One's white balance is much better at night. Lastly, HDR mode is a little too strong; it does so well at highlighting the shadows that it ends up making the rest of the picture look a tad cartoonish. All told, the camera is one area in which flagship devices still outperform the One, but at least it's a slight improvement over the Nexus. (I've added an album of full-res photos to Flickr , and will continue to add more as new updates come out.) That said, the built-in editing software has some serious chops, in case your photo needs a little post-production flair. If you feel the HDR effect is too strong (or you want to bump it up even more), you can change filter strength or switch to a different preset style. You can also adjust the color, focus, sharpness and brightness. Even better, you can select certain areas of each image that you want to tweak. There are also heaps of filter options thrown in for good measure.. Video recording here is solid, with up to 4K resolution and a bit rate of 20 Mbps. You can also film in 60 fps slow motion at 1080p and 120 fps at 720p. Since the One doesn't have optical image stabilization, CM had to tweak the software to ease the pain a bit. It certainly helps, because footage is noticeably smoother. It can't fully replace actual hardware, of course, but the software enhancements at least make a difference. The front mics seemed to pick up more sound than the rear ones, so when taking movies of my children, my voice came out much stronger unless they were close by; when filming them outdoors, however, they sounded muffled when they were more than a few feet away.. It's hard to believe that a $300 device like the One has as much muscle underneath the hood as the Galaxy S5 and Oppo Find 7. In fact, you technically can't get any faster, since the phone sports a 2.45GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 (MSM8974-AC), a 578MHz Adreno 330 GPU and 3GB of RAM. Until the Snapdragon 805 comes out later this year, this is the absolute best silicon that Qualcomm has to offer. But what does it mean to you? Smooth everything, fast everything and no lag as far as the eye can see. If you don't mind my nitpicks: The gaming experience is still slightly sluggish with the occasional frame skip, but it's not very noticeable unless you're paying close attention. Additionally, since the phone's still running on a pre-release build, there are a few kinks that OnePlus needs to iron out before it releases the One to the world. CyanogenMod's firmware gives you the option to change your performance profile to one of three modes, ranging from power conservation to battery sucker. If you don't want to use any presets, you can adjust some of the settings manually, such as minimum and maximum CPU frequency. This is definitely in advanced territory; I don't recommend you try it unless you know what you're doing.. One such issue is soft audio output, both on the external speakers and in the earpiece. All of my conversations were much quieter than they should have been, and I could barely hear music blaring at full volume. (OnePlus tells me this will be resolved in an upcoming update, and I'll amend my review as soon as that happens.) Fortunately, none of this was a problem when I used headphones; in fact, I often had to turn down the volume to make my ears feel comfortable. In addition, the One has an equalizer app called AudioFX, which lets you fine-tune the audio.. Battery life, at least, is a bright spot. The One has a 3,100mAh non-removable cell that's just a tad smaller than the battery inside the Note 3. What's more, it's actually larger than what you'll find in the GS5 and One M8. On most days, I made it to the end of the evening with around 5-10 percent life remaining. (On average, this constituted 14-15 hours of solid use, and roughly four hours of screen-on time.) These were days full of emails, calls, travel, social networking and a little bit of gaming. All told, our standard video rundown test yielded 10 hours of life. This isn't the best I've seen, but I'd consider it well above average for a smartphone -- and I'm hard-pressed to ask for more from a $300 device.. Good things come to those who wait. Phones with lower asking prices often come with excruciating delays, and OnePlus' first handset is no exception. The company is going to have a difficult time meeting demand right away, which is one reason why it's offering the One on an invite-only basis at the beginning. The $299 16GB option, which will come in white, will go out to the first batch of invites in mid to late May; the $349 64GB model, offered in black, starts shipping in early June. For the rest of you still waiting for an invite, OnePlus is hoping to send one your way by the end of June. At launch, the OnePlus One will be available in 16 countries: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the UK and the US. Once it's ready, the One will face intense competition. The most notable device in its price range is the Nexus 5, which you can get for $349 (16GB) or $399 (32GB). It comes unlocked and has the full native Google experience, but admittedly, it doesn't have as extensive a spec list as the One. The Nexus 5 is still the best option if you want timely updates, but CyanogenMod has a good track record of pushing updates quickly, and since the ROM is baked into the device (rather than requiring a separate install), it makes the chances of getting prompt refreshes even more likely. CM's also pledged that it will support updates for the One for at least two years.. It doesn't make sense that the OnePlus One should be this inexpensive. It looks elegant, feels solid and performs smoothly, and it doesn't show any signs that it's a first-generation product from an unknown company. Regardless of how well it sells , the industry will see this as a benchmark for what an affordable phone really can be. All told, it outperforms Google's Nexus 5 in nearly every way -- and it does so at an even lower price. Heck, it's better than many flagship phones that sell for twice as much.. The OnePlus One gets close to the perfection it's aspiring for, but it's not for everyone. Many will despise its large form factor, non-removable battery and lack of external storage. To a nitpicky reviewer like myself, a truly perfect device would also include wireless charging and some type of waterproofing. But let's be real: It just isn't going to happen in a $299 device, especially one that's already filled to the brim with flagship features.. Here's the thing: The One doesn't have to be perfect for me to recommend it. A few missing features? Sure, no problem. What matters is that it's perfect for you, and it fits all of your needs. Besides, imperfections make us eager to see what's around the corner. In the meantime, we keep dreaming of perfection, and perhaps one day we'll actually find it..

Press enter or click on the search icon. Battery Life, Sound Quality and Verdict. Originally reviewed on 3 July 2014 – read the latest on its successor the OnePlus 3. When the OnePlus One was first announced we were sceptical. How can a phone priced at £229/$350 really compete with the might of Samsung in the high-end phone arena? There was a lot of hype around it, in fact the OnePlus One is the most hyped phone from an unknown manufacturer ever. It wasn’t that long ago that OnePlus didn’t even exist as a company.. The good news is that you can have your cake and eat it. The OnePlus is a proper high-end smartphone that comes at a fraction of the price of the competition. Of course it’s not perfect, no phone is, but it’s hard to find another phone that offered as much bang-for-buck as the OnePlus One when it first launched. It’s been out for over a year now though, and the price of it’s key competitors – the Samsung Galaxy S5 and LG G3 – have tumbled.. So is it still worth getting? The answer isn’t the resounding yes it was last year. You can now get the similarly specced LG G3 for just a little more – and that won TrustedReviews Phone of the Year in 2014. You also need to consider the fact that it isn’t compatible with some 4G networks in the UK. That makes it an instant no-go for many of you.. With those caveats in place, let’s take a closer look…. SEE ALSO: Best Phablets 2015. The OnePlus One is actually significantly larger than some of the phones it’s designed to compete with, like the Galaxy S6 and HTC One M9. That’s because the phone has a 5.5-inch screen – just like the iPhone 6 Plus that costs three times as much. We imagine OnePlus takes no small amount of glee in offering such a large screen at half the price of its 5-inch competitors.. Consequently, though, the OnePlus One does take a bit more getting used to than those phones. But it is way off the ridiculous size of supersize phones like the Nexus 6 and HTC One Max. You can still use it in one hand. One other way the OnePlus One manages to have a style all of its own is by using a very unusual rear finish. We used the black 64GB version and it has an oddly, deliberately rough soft-touch finish. It’s like a cross between sandpaper and felt. That may sound terrible, but it’s very tactile surface that makes the phone feel that bit more substantial than a lot of other phones, including the Samsung Galaxy S5. It almost feels like it’s made of stone.. SEE ALSO: OnePlus One vs Oppo Find 7a. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. The OnePlus One also comes in white, but only in its lesser 16GB storage edition. OnePlus plans to offer other back covers made of different materials, but don’t hold your breath about these being easily available in the UK.. The back of the phone is removable, but it’s not designed to be removed frequently, there’s no hidden memory card slot and the battery is locked in place. You need a tool to get the back off too – it’s just there to let people customise the phone if they really want to.. OnePlus is a Chinese company and China is famous for its phones that ‘borrow’ the designs of other better-known phones. But the OnePlus One successfully creates its own look and feel, and one that compares fairly well with all the other top-end phones we have here in the UK.. SEE ALSO: OnePlus One Problems: Is it too good to be true?. The design is deliberately simple, too. A micro-SIM tray sits near-invisibly on the phone’s side, and as the volume and power buttons are a similar colour to the OnePlus One’s back, they’re effectively hidden when viewed from any distance. Even the OnePlus logo is remarkably small – especially given that building a brand is OnePlus’s number one priority at this point in its sub 1-year existence.. Clear design thought has gone into the OnePlus One. It’s not as stunning as the HTC One M8, but for a first effort from a small company, it’s quite the achievement.. This picture tells you a little more about quite how bit the OnePlus is. While the LG G3 has the same size screen, the OnePlus One is still significntly bigger as it doesn’t have the super-slim screen surround of LG’s latest.. The OneOlus One is 153mm tall, 76mm wide and 8.9mm thick. It is thin, but has a substantial footprint. Weight is no real issue, though.. As its core is made of lightweight magnesium, the OnePlus One weighs 162g. That’s a very similar weight to the smaller HTC One M8. SEE ALSO: Best Android Phone Round-up. The hardware is a success story as long as you can handle that extra size. But there’s a serious problem under the hood of the OnePlus One, and we think it is the number one problem with the phone.. The phone supports the 700, 1700, 2600, 2300, 2100 and 1800MHz bands. If this means nothing to you, don’t worry – it’s not what’s there that matters.. The problem is that there’s one missing band that’s extremely important in the UK – 800Mhz, also known as band 20. Several networks here use this band, and as the OnePlus One doesn’t support it, you can’t get 4G on O2, Vodafone, GiffGaff, Tesco or Lycamobile. Three also relies on the 800MHz band for some of its 4G, so 4G signal on that network in certain areas may not be too hot.. That only leaves EE and Three, which use the 1800MHz band that’s compatible with the OnePlus One. If you’re on one of those networks, you’re good to go (4G).. SEE ALSO: Best Mobile Phones 201 5. This is a serious issue, and is the best reason to leave this phone on the shelf. Why has OnePlus left such an important band out? Because it’s not really an important band in other key territories.. An official statement on the OnePlus forums suggests the band was left out as it is only used to supply rural areas of the UK and other countries with 4G. Last time we checked, London wasn’t all that rural. Still, let’s not forget this is OnePlus’s first go at a phone.. The one other missing connectivity bit is an IR blaster, which lets you use a phone as a universal remote for your TV, Blu-ray player and so on. Over the past couple of years we’ve mellowed from thinking this is pointless to kind-of useful, but we’re yet to meet many people who have the feature and actually use it.. All the other high-end bells and whistles are here. NFC, ac-grade Wi-Fi and Cat4 4G are all in place in the One.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

I would like to start an informational discussion about the phone and I will, also, post everything I learn about it once I plug it in and see what happens. Please feel free to begin the discussion without me and before I post information like APN, tethering and WiFi calling(if even possible.). This content has been marked as final.. Show 48 replies.

WiFi Calling won't be possible -- at least until it gets finished being built into the Google version of the OS (aka Nexus version) and then ported to the OnePlus One.. It's not slated for the Nexus until sometime early 2015.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to smplyunprdctble ). It is just that WiFi and the dialer are separated to stay more secure. They need to be able to simply talk to one another. You can easily make WiFi calls just using an apk. But T-Mobile lets you use your own number for WiFi calls through the standard dialer. Someone just needs to home bake T-Mobiles changes into the OS. Which I believe Android L will fully support and you can just port the WiFi calling probably will just be an apk that uses the OS integration.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to smplyunprdctble ). I, also, find it arrogant for T-Mobile to say " At no additional cost. For all T-Mobile customers with a Wi-Fi Calling capable device." when that isn't even true. Virtually all phones and tablets that can connect to an internet connection are WiFi Calling capable. It's just that if you want to use your T-Mobile number than you are forced to pay extra for the modified WiFi Dialer settings baked into the phone. So, I would argue that the additional costs are a reverse of what T-Mobile is saying. In my opinion, it is my number and I can do what I want with it. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to bradgrant ). When T-Mobile says "WiFi Calling", they mean their WiFi Calling technology.. And, only T-Mobile branded devices [and now iDevices] have this WiFi Calling Capability.. Otherwise, it's "Internet Calling" (as you said it's identified in the settings) or "SIP".. Neither of these technologies require WiFi, as they generally prefer to be used with wired connections (Think Vonage and that which are connected directly to the router or modem). Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to smplyunprdctble ). Actually SIP is built directly into the Settings in the phone dialer of the One. With the correct information it would be a simple task. I can also force all calls to go through a data network.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to bradgrant ). Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to smplyunprdctble ). Sad to say I am not thrilled with performance of Wi-Fi calling.. On Samsung S5 calls more than not are of poor quality or so garbled the other party could not understand me even though I heard them fine.. I called Tech Support and stated something would be done on their end to help the calling.. It ultimately did not and when calling again the Tech suggested setting Wi-Fi calling setting to Cellular Preferred which defeats the purpose of Wi-Fi calling.. I went so far as getting T Mobile's massaged router which is the same as my ASUS router with T Mobile's magic but not better.. Was on a calling two days ago and call on Wi-Fi started OK but became garbled for recipient but after few minutes became clear again. This cannot really be depended on for consistently clear calls.. I am now using only cellular in my house with usually 2 bars and works OK most of the time.. I will be interested to see if Lollipop improves Wi-Fi calling.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to doctorbob49 ). WiFi Calling (along with any Internet Calling) requires a decent speed Internet Connection.. So, your ISP has a lot to do with what happens.. There's someone who came in recently with Satellite Internet.. That's got decent download speeds, but HORRIBLE upload speeds.. The (land-based) providers in my area have "budget" internet plans as low as $20.. These plans have awesome speeds for basic web browsing... may work for streaming one device, but won't work well with any Internet calling capabilities (I'm sure you haven't tried Skype or Vonage on said service, but would probably wind up with similar results). Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to smplyunprdctble ). I have RoadRunner with 100Mb download and 10Mb upload speeds.. don't think that is my problem.. When calling my Brother on cellular he states much clearer than Wi-Fi at. Wish T Mobile was still using UMA which worked better.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to doctorbob49 ). Yeah -- 100/10 shouldn't have a problem.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to smplyunprdctble ). I have been using Google Hangouts, Viber. GrooveIP etc with my OnePlus One. on the Simple $45 plan for placing phone calls.. Switched off cellular, so only on wifi.. Are the apps above both wifi and cellular?. How do they relate to the 'wifi calling' folks are. Like Show 1 Likes (1). ( in response to bukzin ). It doesn't relate to the WiFi Calling folks are looking for.. WiFi Calling is a T-Mobile application that allows you to do calls out via your T-Mobile number over a WiFi connection.. GrooveIP and the rest allow you to do calls over a data connection (WiFi or Cellular) with a DIFFERENT number from your T-Mobile number.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to smplyunprdctble ). The good folks at our local TMobile store offered me a free ASUS. Looks like a good unit; has 4 Ethernet ports for additional gear.. I assume it, in effect, boosts my WiFi signal. Does it provide any other benefit for home use?. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to bukzin ). The router is designed to optimize T-Mobile's WiFi Calling.. It does nothing for non-T-Mobile branded devices.. It may give you better WiFi signal throughout the house.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to smplyunprdctble ). Of course my OnePlus One phone is an unbranded TMobile phone.. I do have the TM Simple Choice SIM plan.. Will this TM router do anything for me?. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to bukzin ). It will do nothing beyond provide a WiFi signal that any router out there will (I swear that's about what I said in my previous response).. The WiFi Router's ONLY purpose is to give folks who have T-Mobile's WiFi Calling better call quality while connected to that router.. It has other features that other folks have clamored about.. But, if we're just talking about sending / receiving calls, the router will do nothing for you.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to bradgrant ). I will update what I learned here: LTE works and says LTE. When making a call it seems to drop to 3G. I used an activated SIM and the phone automatically picked the correct APN settings. I added a couple of lines to the APN just for a little more than a little less to cover my next base.. Tethering works and I'm using it now to send this message.. MMS unsure as I haven't tested it.. There is Internet Calling in the phone menu. Even if it might not be able to support T-Mobile which I'm not sure it could support WiFi and Voice over LTE or VoIP in any case.. I haven't tested the Internet Calling and have no way to test it out right now. In any case, I will post test results as I get them.. However the changes I made were specific to see - hipri,dun- and - APN protocol: IPv4/IPv6-. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to bradgrant ). I just received a One Plus One.. Went to T-Mobile store with my sim card. Phone will not recognize the sim card. Service rep tried to manually enter info. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to wayne5446@gmail.com ). The exact same thing happened to me. I took my one plus one to the store. Two guys tried for a few minutes to make the phone recognize the sim card, but it did not work. As soon as i got home I tried myself flipping the sim card and it worked.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to bradgrant ). The biggest problem with SIP dialer isn't calling out but your phone needing to check the SIP dialer network all the time to keep seeing if there are any current calls. It's a death sentence for a battery if it isn't plugged into a power source or used sparingly.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to bradgrant ). can we get an official answer or representation from T-Force?. I consider T Mobile's heritage to be that of an underdog. With that said, I think T Mobile should have great respect for oneplus. They too are an underdog trying to make an amazing phone for a fair price... They are the "un- smartphone manufacturer". I would like to see t-mobile support oneplus by offering wifi calling two companies like oneplus. I am very happy with the direction T Mobile has gone with their uncarrier effort. And I am hoping that it can be extended two companies in phones like the one plus one.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to bradgrant ). I wasn't arguing for internet calling anyways. I never use it and even if I did there are a dozen other ways to contact someone. Yes, it's convenient but I honestly never used it with my T999 and my T999L. I, also, never use much tethering which is why I'm happy to have a 20 dollar Unlimited. So, overall it's not too bad. T-Mobile needs WiFi calling because of their lower regional scope range and their frequencies do not penetrate walls very well. Though I really only drop out here and there sometimes. Especially in very very old buildings with thick stone mason walls.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to bradgrant ). It's a combination of coverage in buildings and wanting to offload some of the Cellular Traffic when they upgrade towers for their Network Modernization project.. The problem with buildings is most of these buildings that the signal can't penetrate are work buildings and employees either may not be allowed on the WiFi, or the WiFi is firewalled to the point that WiFi Calling won't work (my opinion is at work you shouldn't be on your phone anyways, but that's just my personal philosophy as I just checked my texts at work ).. WiFi Calling is cool in low-signal areas.. It's wicked awesome when traveling abroad.. But, I'd personally not buy service from a carrier that didn't cover me at home without having to use extra tools (specifically for the reason that I wouldn't be able to bring my own device like you are).. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to smplyunprdctble ). I'm pretty sure that the One is capable of WiFi calling. The issue is that Android itself blocks the WiFi and the Dialer from interacting. I guess Lollipop will open that door. However, I would like to see TMobile add my phone to their list of phones.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to bradgrant ). No, the issue is OS hooks.. There's specific OS hooks that are required for T-Mobile's WiFi Calling that Android doesn't provide by default.. They cannot be installed as part of .apks otherwise every ROM out there would have T-Mobile's WiFi Calling feature.. My suspicion is it's some sort of SIM Card Access because that's what identifies you on T-Mobile's cellular network.. Obtaining access to the SIM Card must require some permissions that aren't available.. Remember -- it's not just the fact you have a non-T-Mobile phone that you can't get WiFi Calling.. It's the fact you don't have a T-Mobile built OS.. The Samsung Galaxy S5 (T-Mobile) has WiFi Calling.. If you get the Google Play Edition, WiFi Calling won't work.. If you install CyanogenMod on the T-Mobile version, WiFi Calling won't work.. If, for some reason, you install the T-Mobile S5 OS on the Google Play Edition (assuming the hardware is the T-Mobile hardware for radios), you would get WiFi Calling.. Because it's built into the OS.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to smplyunprdctble ). T-Mobile understands the value of Wi-Fi calling better than any other carrier out there... That is why it was their latest addition to their Un-carrier theme.. We don't need to sell the value of wifi here... We need to sell the idea of extending the capability to the oneplus one (and ultimately. I love my oneplus one and I've loved my wifi calling that T-Mobile has offered me on my two previous phones.. Now I am emploring T-Mobile to bring 2 things that I love together.. Only T-Mobile can do this .. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to insaneoctane ). As I said before, there's Custom OS reasons WiFi Calling isn't currently available outside T-Mobile branded devices.. There's been an announcement that the Nexus 6 will have WiFi Calling available in early 2015.. That means that either the OS Hooks will be built into Android and/or the actual WiFi Calling software will be built into the OS (similar to iPhone6).. Either one of those two means that as the capabilities are going to be available for a wider range of non-T-Mobile devices as long as they can handle the newer versions of Android.. T-Mobile will not provide an OS build with WiFi Calling for every device out there.. T-Mobile apparently has worked with Google to get capabilities built in, and the Android community is hoping this will be open sourced for all devices within a build of Lollipop.. We don't know how widespread this capability is going to be yet.. You're blaming T-Mobile for the lack of WiFi Calling being available across other devices.. It's NOT T-Mobile's fault the folks who designed the base Operating System hasn't allowed whatever is needed to make it available to a broader audience.. Depending on the results of getting WiFi Calling in the Nexus 6 (which is 100% managed by Google -- NOT T-Mobile) will determine the speed and availability of getting WiFi Calling in other Non-T-Mobile devices.. So, in short, the EARLIEST WiFi Calling COULD be available for non-T-Mobile branded devices (outside the Nexus, which has a date of early 2015) is probably next summer.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to smplyunprdctble ). T-Mobile needs to work with Google to allow their wifi on base code.. Today no phone gets T-Mobile wifi calling unless T-Mobile has rolled their own version of the ROM.. I would like T-Mobile to work on getting t-mobile wifi calling out to other handsets that do not have custom t-mobile ROMs (like my oneplus one). That will require working with Google (or CM). That's what I am asking t-mobile to do.. I am allowed to ask this and I hope others do too.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to smplyunprdctble ). I know you are very sage on these issues.. Any idea how Sprint enabled WiFi. Prior to coming to T Mobile I had S5 with. They released OTA update that enabled WiFi calling where before it. Possible T Mobile could do the same or is Samsung different?. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to doctorbob49 ). Just like T-Mobile, Sprint has built WiFi Calling into some devices.. Sprint controls the OS on their Samsung devices, just as T-Mobile controls the OS on the Samsung versions they sell.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to smplyunprdctble ). Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to doctorbob49 ). Since no carriers sell the OnePlusOne, there's no carrier-specific version of the OS to have them include any carrier-specific things like WiFi Calling..

Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to nevsky ). The oneplus used to run in cyanogen didn't it?. If it is built of the source from Google and that is in the branch of code they pull, it should work after they include it.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to theartiszan ). At this point, my understanding is that the Nexus 6 has some special code or something, as the seamless Wi-Fi will only work with the Nexus 6 and not other non-T-Mobile branded Android phones.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to nevsky ). Have to remember Google explicitly stated the Nexus 6 AND in the future MORE devices. That tells me its up to OEMs or Google. The code is originally open sourced by T-Mobile and Google started implementing their code started with 4.0 to now.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to tidbits ). The T-Mobile code is open sourced? Was that announced?. Like Show 1 Likes (1). ( in response to nevsky ). The T-Mobile code has been open sourced for a long time now.. Just wasn't implemented by others until now.. Google just now implemented it with their new version.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to nevsky ). IMS was open sourced since 2011-12(Don't remember exact year).. Google implemented pieces of it since Android 4.0 and now it's to the point where T-Mobile could work something out with WiFi calling and why it's on the Nexus 6.. Like Show 0 Likes (0).

Some people claim wifi calling works on the phone with little or no evidence. I have yet to see a video. I travel a lot so a dual sim phone is something that I would love, I may have to buy this phone and hope wifi calling works. If it doesn't, I will return the device.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. has managed to create a bit of a buzz around their latest smartphone. Called 'One' (but I'll go with the OnePlus One for most of this review to avoid the confusion with HTC) this is a handset that goes out of its way to be attractive. The styling is simple but functional, the specs are close to the top of the range in the world of Android, and the price is stunning. It's not a typo, it actually starts at £229 in the UK ($299 in the US) for the 16 GB model.. If that's not enough, the OnePlus One uses. CyanogenMod as the operating system - a free and open source OS based on Google's official releases of Android with strong community support.. Let's start with the OS, because it is the. biggest unique selling point of the handset. The OnePlus One uses a version of CyanogenMod 11 called 11S. This is based around Android 4.4.2 Kitkat (for those of you keeping track, the current version in the handset is 11.0-XNPH22Q).. As one of the first phones to ship out of the factory with CyanogenMod installed (as opposed to sitting down with a multitude of flashing tools, roms, and long linux command line incantations to switch over. an existing Android handset), this significantly reduces the barrier of entry. It's also worth nothing that the OnePlus One does ship with the Google apps that a consumer would expect to see... Google Play for installing and updating applications, Gmail, Calendar, Google Plus, Google Cards, Google Music, Hangouts, they are all here. You're not going to pick up this handset and wonder why you can't. The OnePlus One (picture: Ewan Spence). OnePlus has resisted the temptation to load up the One with. The core apps for the Google experience are here, as are the core apps for a smartphone experience. There's no duplication of application functionality here.. You get the stock Android apps out of the box, and just a few additions to help you live.. One of those additions is the torch app, which you can activate with a touch-base. shortcut on the screen when the OnePlus One is on stand-by, or idling on the lock screen. Draw a quick 'V' on the screen and the. camera LED will turn on like a touch. You can also draw a circle to activate the camera, or a two fingered swipe to play or pause. You can also double tap the screen instead of pressing the power button to wake up the device. Given the nature of the power button (it is very small and almost flush to the edge of the device), this is a welcome addition to the UI of. pick up the handset and wonder where everything is in the software. CyanogenMod is about customisation and choice, but one of the choices that the CyanogenMod community has started with is that Android is pretty good on its own, and Google's launcher and interface is a really good starting point. Anyone with existing Android experience (especially on the Nexus devices) is going to feel comfortable with this handset. It's very close to the UI provided by manufacturers like Samsung, Sony, and HTC.. That's important, because the OnePlus One must. appeal to the general consumer as well as the hacker. Out of the box this is handset that doesn't scare anyone who's worked with Android, everything is where you. would expect it to be, apps are easy to find, options. are there to explore, it's a phone you will be comfortable with.. But it's also a phone where the flexibility that has become a mark of CyanogenMod is also on display. Almost everything in the UI is user-configurable,. carries 'theme' support to change every element of the UI in one click, and when you start to explore the settings. dialogs, you'll realise almost every item can be tweaked.. On one hand this can feel rather overpowering, but on the other it means the OnePlus One can feel much more like 'your' device than the single. core Android UI keys of 'menu. When the OnePlus One is active, these are dimly lit and I'm happy to use them. But you can switch them off and have the OnePlus One UI provide. touch sensitive part of the bezel. You trade a bit of screen real estate for brighter icons that react to the UI and change their look and orientation as required.. The main lesson is that you get to choose, and you are not limited to a design choice made by the manufacturer.. The OnePlus One (picture: Ewan Spence). the version 11S of CyanogenMod will be enough to attract the hacker. and developer communities that want to tinker with the operating system. For everyone else, the specifications are going to. The OnePlus One sports a Snapdragon 801 CPU system-on-chip, coupled with 3 GB of RAM. The quad-core CPU runs at 2.45 GHz, and is paired up with the Adreno 330 GPU. Until Qualcomm ship the Snapdragon 805, this is the fastest configuration for Android out there.. This smartphone is fast, and with a touch more RAM than the Samsung Galaxy S5, offers a very slightly better performance when using test bench scores. In use it is fast and smooth, and you would be hard pushed to find a faster Android smartphone on the market at the moment..

By Agent_fabulous , Recognized Developer on 2nd September 2017, 03:08 PM. Now that I'm done saving my butt, let's proceed. - Backup all your data ( Important ). - Wipe /system, /data and cache. - Flash the ROM + GApps (Download link below). You shouldn't have to flash gapps again. Wipe system and flash rom+gapps only when specified in the release post ). Note: The ROM does support MultiROM, but I do not support custom kernels and mods at this point. Before submitting a crash/issue/bug, make sure you:. - Are not using a custom kernel. - Are not using any mods. (In case you are, make sure it's unrelated to the issue and mention it). Make sure you mention which build you're using and upload a:. Share a logcat using adb or an app like CatLog. Q : Is root access included into AOSP?. A : No it is not. It is however available via adb. Some testers have had success with Magisk too. Q : Can I flash ABC mod? Does the ROM support it?. A : Yeah sure, but I will not support you. And no, the ROM probably does not support it. Q : Can I flash XYZ kernel?. A : No, there's a fair number of kernel changes from Nougat to Oreo. Thunder kernel is compatible with oreo. Q : What GApps should I flash?. A : I'm really not sure, you tell me. Q : Is the ROM suited for daily usage ?. A : Using it as a daily driver. Q : I see errors during the installation, is it normal ?. A : If it is E:unknown command [log] , ignore it for now. Q : I used unofficial oreo opengapps and it says that the android version doesn't match. A : According to a few people, mounting system before installing gapps lets it install. I haven't tried gapps myself though. Q : I have FCs on GApps/I can't sign in! What should I do?. A : This is an issue starting from r21. Please boot without gapps, flash gapps and update play services and play store from apkmirror. Q : It says "No OS installed" when I try rebooting from TWRP. A : Just reboot, it's normal. Q : WHEN UPDATE?? GIB UPDATE PL0X. A : I only post updates when there's a decent list of changes. I'm a college student and there's only so much I can do. Please do not spam my PM regarding this. I will not respond to any messages demanding ETAs. ROM: ROM Download ( BasketBuild | AndroidFileHost ).
