I know this is not a keitai (Not a Japan Market phone) but it is a Toshiba so I am hoping you will lend me your advice and answers. A friend of mine was in Europe for six months studying and bought a Toshiba TS705 3G bar phone. She has come back and is giving me the thing on Saturday. It is locked to a European carrier (it did not dawn on me to remember to ask this question to her before so I don't know which one right now). The Toshiba TS705 is a strictly Euro market phone that is 2100mhz 3G and GSM 900,1800 and 1900 bar phone that has a unique swing out camera that can be used in 3G calls. It was most likely a pay as you go phone but it shows how advanced Europe is with phones and networks if they offer 3G on low level phones as opposed to the USA. Since I don't have a Toshiba phone yet, i was wondering how well Toshiba phones are quality wise? I has been looking for a good Japan made bar phone for a while and the Panasonic Softbank one was MM locked and I did not like the looks or cost of the Sharp 550SH (all refurbed and $100 price). I know I can get the Toshiba unlocked with a code but I still have the hypersim from attempt at hypersimming the 903 to unlock it. Why yes, that is a bag phone. Join Date Jul 2009.

Hemos escrito un email al soporte de Toshiba Europa con esa duda, y como se suele decir en estos casos, tenemos 2 noticias, una buena y una mala: - La noticia buena es que el soporte de una empresa enorme como Toshiba no sólo ha respondido anuestra duda por email, sino que lo ha hecho en apenas 12 horas. - La noticia mala es que Toshiba NO tiene aún Drivers del Toshiba TS705 para Windows Vista. De cualquier manera, no remiten a su web de recursos de Toshiba Mobile para comprobar cuando pueda estar disponible el driver: http://www.toshiba-europe.com /mobile/ Lo sentimos mucho Bel, pero lo hemos intentado.

Toshiba TS705 - user opinions and reviews. 10MB storage, microSD (dedicated slot) card slot. Pages: « 1 2 3 ». can anyone tellme how can i transfer my mp3 music from pc to the phone without bluetooth??. I hav a Toshiba TS705 and it's a great phone. In the user guide speak only cards with less of 512mb, but I use a uSD of 2gb without problems. Games for this cellphone I dunno, but dosen't need.... do we need a java code play games like samsung?. Does any one know if java games may be installed via bluetooth?. is there a way loading game with bluetooth,usb cable or with a card reader? is it only work with wap?. hey guys i have the phone but when i run the data manager it cant connect to the pc,says cannot connect or something. i just want to put some @$#@!@ songs in the phone and i cant.please help me.. Therez a very simple solution to your problem, just remove the memory card from your mobile phone & insert the memory card into the card reader and connect the card reader to your computer and transfer the mp3 tracks, I am sure it wud not take even 10 mins to transfer 10 tracks that way. Once ur done, disconnect the card reader from ur computer & insert the card to the phone. please anyone could tell me operating voltage (output voltage)for this phone, i got the phone but charger is missing, couldnt find charger in market, help me... Bought it 6 months ago for 300 euros!! today you can find it at the stores for 100!. Really sucks! You cant download files more than 1mb via wap and the 500mb micro sd is like useless because if you use the data cable you can only transfer files to the phone memory and not the memory card! It took me 8 hours to transfer 10 mp3 songs from my pc to the phone as i had to transfer them one by one to the phone memory and then move them to the memory card!! It takes like an hour to move a 6mb song from the phone memory to the memory card!!!! This supposed to be a 3g phone???. do you know any available game and application for ts705?. this phone is by far the worst phone I have ever had.. you cant even assigm different ringtones to messages (only the ones which were there by default)..you can only use your own ringtones for phonecalls. Also the batteryindicator is wrong (goes off even though it says its still half full) oh and if you set a "one time" alarm at night (before 0 o clock) to like 6 am in the morning it wont work because it asumes you meant YESTERDAY.. (got late to work because of that). I wrote toshiba about it..and hey..they dont care.. I am glad I got rid of that thing.. No, only supports a 512mb micro sd card. pls can anyone tell me if this phone supports more than 1 Gb card??? i`m intrested in buying a 2 Gb card but... i don`t wanna take unless i know if it`s supported by the phone...i have a 512 Mb card.. amm toshiba, if this phone will become available in pholippines you know i will buy because i like the rotating camera coz i had Nokia 6630 but in the package it doesn't have a video stand free. this model really caught my eye, maybe because it has a rotating cam, i really want one like that, i just wished it was 2 or 3MP. toshiba plans for a share at european mobile market.why make this model look like SE T610?should try a bit harder on design.anyway it seems nice,the cam function is brilliant and it's toshiba!does anycody know the expected price?i am very curious for the review about the ui etc and the brand generally because its a newcomer. it's look amazing i realy craze on this phone. anyone tel me the price of this phone and wat abt the clarity of the picture,is it possible to transfer images frm nokia.anyone one tel me.thanx in advance.. it's nice & good looking it gives an hygenic look in future set was very much impressed by all. the flipping camera is indeed cute... For such a low price, it's packed with really techy features... I'm wondering, however, why a giant computer company like Toshiba is manufacturing these kind of phones... Sure, they're joining the bandwagon of mobile phone success but I kind of expected more from toshiba. I'm looking forward to the day they would come-up w/ phones w/ unique toshiba interface and wi-fi function, etc... i do hope that this phone will be reviewed just so we can peak into the works of this phone, especially its user interface. I loved their computers but I'm not sure if it can invoke the same emotion through its mobile phones.. Hmm, what a cool idea for a camera placement! Well done toshiba, it looks excellent for normal photos and also self shots..you can even use ur phone as a mirror to apply lipstick, haha. I hope the hinge for the camera has a lock mechanism or something so that over time, you dont have the problem of dealing with a loose flipping camera, literally. Otherwise a very unique camera design. Hope other companies pick it up as well, i think its great!. Pages: « 1 2 3 ». Total of 48 user reviews and opinions for Toshiba TS705 ..
