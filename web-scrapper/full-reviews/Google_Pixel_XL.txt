Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Everything you need to know. A year on, Google's Pixels remain important — this is what you need to know.. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are here. Google's Pixel and Pixel XL are fantastic. These phones are the first made entirely under Google's control, following in the footsteps of the two Chromebook Pixels and the Pixel C tablet — and they marked a new era of smartphones blessed by Google.. That makes these phones interesting from a hardware perspective, wearing just the "G" logo on the back and taking on some neat design cues, but also in terms of how the software and features are deeply integrated into these aluminum blocks. Here's everything you need to know about the Google Pixel and Pixel XL.. What will happen to the original Pixels?. Should you upgrade to a Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL?. Exactly one year on from the launch of the original Pixels, Google refreshed the line with the new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. Once again the goal is to provide the "same" experience in two different sizes, with the Pixel 2 coming in with a 5-inch display and the Pixel 2 XL a 6-inch display. Aside from the screen and battery size, the rest of the specs, software and experience are the same.. Compared to the original Pixels, the new Pixel 2s have better specs, new-and-improved cameras, a few new software tricks, water resistance and stereo speakers. They carry on much of the same design look and feel as the originals, with some subtle tweaks and a taller form factor in the case of the Pixel 2 XL.. Google Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2: Everything you need to know. Of course, the original Pixels continue to live on — at lower prices, and still with plenty of runway in terms of software updates. They will get the latest versions of Android Oreo, right alongside the new Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2. And aside from any hardware limitations, they should have all of the same features as well.. The original Pixels won't be left behind — expect software support for Android P and beyond.. The interesting thing to see will be how much Google brings camera improvements back to the original Pixels. So much of what Google does with photography is in the software rather than hardware, and it's feasible that the original Pixels could ride the wave of camera improvements through a newer version of Android and the new Google Camera app.. If you choose to hold onto one, the 2016 versions of the Pixel and Pixel XL will get Android P in 2018 as well — and get security updates for another year after that. So you don't have to worry about being left behind.. Should you buy an original Pixel or Pixel XL in 2017?. If you love using your original Pixel or Pixel XL, there's a good chance you're considering dropping the cash to buy the upgraded version this year. So what would you get by upgrading?. In the case of the Pixel to the Pixel 2, you're seeing pretty small changes. The hardware is very similar, but now coated in a bit grippier material to make it easier to hold — and on the front you'll find an improved display and stereo speakers. Inside you get a slightly smaller battery, but a faster and more efficient Snapdragon 835 processor with a base of 64GB of storage. The camera is undoubtedly better, too — and that's compared to an already great camera on the original.. Most of the above is also applicable to an upgrade from the Pixel XL to the 2 XL, though the changes are a bit more dramatic. The new Pixel 2 XL moves to a different design language with a taller display and smaller bezels, making better use of the phone's overall size to give you more screen. On the other hand, it's also more expensive — the starting price has jumped to $849 this year.. Read (and watch) our Google Pixel review. With the new Pixel 2 and 2 XL now available, Google isn't shutting down the originals — instead, it's continuing to sell them at a $100 discount from both the Google Store and Verizon. That means a 2016 Pixel will be $549, and a Pixel XL will be $669.. As we covered above, you won't have to worry about software support abruptly ending on your year-old phone, which is a solid reason to consider these phones. At the same time, they also have a headphone jack that the new models lack. And though they don't have the exact same internal specs, there's no doubt that the Pixel and Pixel XL are still super fast and smooth even a year on.. Chances are a $549 Pixel isn't so enticing when for just $100 more you could get the brand new Pixel 2 — but at $669 the Pixel XL could be enticing compared to the $849 Pixel 2 XL.. First-generation Pixel is now available for $549, Pixel XL for $669. You get 24/7 support built in. You get unlimited full-quality camera backups. You should look at Project Fi. The easiest way to learn about Google's Pixel phones, as we experienced them closely after their launch, is to read our full review and then watch the video review that goes along with it!. Google's branding for the Pixel phones is a tad confusing, as the name used in marketing is just "Pixel" while we of course we know there's more than one phone available. But the way you should look at this is just two different screen sizes of the same phone: a 5-inch Pixel, and a 5.5-inch Pixel XL.. The phones are identical in terms of internal specs, build, hardware quality, features and software — there are just three differences to note: the Pixel XL has a larger 5.5-inch display, a higher 2560x1440 resolution, and a larger 3450mAh battery. That compares to the Pixel's 5-inch 1920x1080 display and 2770mAh battery.. The drop in screen resolution shouldn't be too upsetting considering the still-high pixel density at 5 inches, and of course when the body gets smaller, the battery is going to shrink as well. Battery life then takes a bit of a drop-off, unfortunately. Really, this comes down to how much screen you need to get your daily tasks done, and how much you can manage in your hand and pocket.. Pixel XL: Which should you buy?. One of the most compelling reasons to buy a phone from Google is software updates. Not only will the Pixels be supported by two years of guaranteed Android platform and feature updates, but you'll also be getting monthly security patches for three years as well. Those updates won't be such a pain to take, either, as seamless updates introduced in Android 7.0 get things in place in the background and apply them quickly on reboot.. There are lots of phones with really cool software features right out of the box, but it's their shaky continued support a year or two down the road that make us take pause. If you don't want to worry about when or where your future software update is coming, the Pixels should be your top choice.. It's not necessarily a software feature at its core, but part of the justification of the Pixels' high prices is the inclusion of live 24/7 support direct from Google. The support is built right into the settings of the phones, and lets you quickly contact Google for a phone call or chat to talk about what's going wrong with your phone.. Much like Amazon pioneered on its Fire tablets, Google can also start a screen sharing session with you so you can literally show your exact problem to the support person and figure it out while on the phone. It's these sorts of things you may not think about all the time, but when you just can't figure out a problem it's great to have it there. The feature may be particularly useful if you're looking at the Pixel for a less tech-savvy family member or friend — you're no longer the tech support!. The best part about the 24/7 support is how it becomes even more useful as the phones get older and approach (or surpass) their warranty dates.. More: The Pixel's secret weapon: 24/7 support. Google Photos and the Pixel are a match made in heaven. Not only do the Pixels have excellent cameras, but Google allows all Pixel owners to back up their photos and videos — even 4K video! — in full resolution for free.. It's one of those things that Google can do only because it owns the entire stack, and it makes owning the phone even better.. The Pixel's secret weapon: Unlimited high-resolution camera backups. Pixel owner? Hop in the forums!. If you're looking to switch carriers after getting your Pixel, you may want to look into switching to Google's own carrier offering called Project Fi. It's an awesome carrier that doesn't tie you down with contracts, agreements, lengthy bills or overage charges — it's all about simplicity, just like the Pixels.. With Project Fi, your Pixel will actively switch between using Sprint, T-Mobile and U.S. Cellular networks depending on which is best, and will also jump on open Wi-Fi outside of your house as well as let you make calls and texts over any Wi-Fi network. It's just $20 per month to start, plus $10 per gigabyte of data you use, no matter how much you use. You're refunded for data you buy but don't consume in the month, and you can even use that data outside of the U.S. There's even a group plan where you can bring along your family to Project Fi.. You can get a Project Fi SIM card for free when you order your Pixel, or if you already have one on the way you can pick up a SIM card when you sign up for Project Fi online .. If you look around a little, you'll see there are plenty of reported problems with the Google Pixel, from Bluetooth to Wi-Fi to microphones cutting out. Google has promised to fix all of them in time, and may have fixed any issues before you got to them in particular, but in the meantime, you can find our running list of Google Pixel issues and share your stories.. Common Google Pixel problems and how to fix them. Even though the Pixel 2 and 2 XL are here now, there are still millions of people happily using the originals. Maybe you're one of them!

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. The iPhone 7 killer made by Google. The Pixel XL features 2016's top-of-the-line specs and is a fine vessel for Android Oreo. This VR-capable phone has a suitably fast processor, even by 2018 standards, and a superb camera, all sandwiched into a funky design.. One of the best phone cameras around. More expensive than a Nexus phone. Peculiar design and no always-on screen. Google Pixel XL vs Google Pixel 2 XL price comparison Price and release date Finding the Google Pixel XL in stock is still difficult More expensive than any Nexus handset On contract from Verizon in US and EE in UK Design Premium – but peculiar glass-and-metal – design No camera bump on the back whatsoever Not waterproof, and no stereo speakers Display Bright and colorful 5.5-inch AMOLED display Better for VR than the 5-inch Google Pixel No rise-to-wake or always-on screen. The Google Pixel XL, along with the Google Pixel , are the first phones 'made [almost entirely] by Google', and it’s the best way to experience the latest and greatest that Android software has to offer.. It puts the immense power of Google search behind everything you do with the all-new Google Assistant, a context-understanding AI that’s often smarter than Siri and Cortana. The Pixel XL launched with Android 7.1 Nougat , runs Android 7.1.2 and was among the first to get Android Oreo. Going with that latest and greatest theme, it was also the first phone to get Google Daydream View VR headset powers.. Even if you’re not into VR, this means you're getting top-of-the-line specs good enough for power-hungry gamers, and that’s fantastic news for anyone who wants a fast phone years down the road – yes, even with the Google Pixel 2 out in the world.. The phone debuts the Snapdragon 821 chipset, with 4GB of RAM inside of a glass-and-metal body that's half-iPhone 7, half Samsung. The camera is touted as 'best in class', and the 5.5-inch Quad HD screen looks superb.. Google is ditching its affordable, developer-focused Nexus brand in favor of the Pixel XL and its smaller 5-inch Google Pixel counterpart. This makes these new handsets more expensive, but they also showcase greater ambition on Google's part.. The price gap between Google's first-gen XL device and the new Google Pixel 2 XL, so far, hasn't been that wide. Thus, purchasing the former over the latter simply couldn't be recommended.. But as time goes by, the decision will become easier. Why? Well, the prices are getting better for the Pixel XL – lower than they've ever been.. While price varies for the original Pixel, you won't see as much fluidity just yet for the Google Pixel 2. It just released in October 2017, so expect to wait another handful of months before big deals show up.. That said, here's a look at the very best values for Google's latest phone.. Believe it or not, the Google Pixel XL is still tough to find in stock. The official Google store has you join a vague waitlist, but you shouldn't have much of an issue scoping out a deal on sites like eBay or Amazon.. Launching at $769 (£719, AU$1,269) for the 32GB version, and $869 (£819, AU$1,419) for the 128GB model, each iteration is now going for $100 less. It’s Google’s smartphone all grown up and that means it’s more expensive than the now discontinued Nexus 6P .. There’s also no 64GB in-between internal storage size, and no microSD slot for expandable storage to make 32GB more tolerable. You have to go big if you're recording a lot of high-resolution video.. You have better shot at finding Google Pixel XL in stock at a carrier store. Verizon sells it on contract, and it's available right now in the US. It costs $32.08 a month over 24 months and comes with day one updates.. Or, you can skip the contract and pay everything up front for the SIM-free Pixel XL. It works just as well on AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint in addition to Verizon thanks to having both GSM and CDMA antennas.. In the UK, you can get the Pixel on contract from EE, paying £9.99 upfront and then £55.99 per month for 10GB of data and unlimited calls and texts.. Google called the Pixel XL design 'bold' during its initial announcement, noting that the back of the phone’s glass-and-metal makeup gives it “personality and character.". If that sounds like a backhanded compliment, it’s kind of deserved. It’s almost as if Google heard that people like metal phones, but also like glass phones, so it decided to throw in both materials.. It’s an odd, two-toned mix on the back side, making the Google Pixel XL feel like we’re one step away from unwrapping the Neapolitan ice cream of smartphones.. It does have rather thick bezel at the top and bottom, despite having no physical home button at the bottom. It looked okay at launch, but 2017's trend of slim bezels proved that this look is getting a little long in the tooth.. The odd, two-toned mix on the back side makes it feel like we’re one step away from unwrapping the Neapolitan ice cream of smartphones.. The good news is that, as funky as it looks, the materials are solid: strengthened Gorilla Glass 4 for the top third around the rear fingerprint sensor and camera, and polished anodized aluminum on the bottom two-thirds where your hand wraps around the phone.. Clutching this phablet shouldn’t be a problem if you could get the taller Nexus 6P in your hands. It measures 153 x 76 x 8.58mm, and tapers off to a depth of 7.31mm around the back.. It’s slightly thicker and boxier than most phones, including the iPhone 7 Plus at 7.3mm, but not quite as tall or, more importantly, wide. Normal-sized hands will do okay here.. Google has thrown a lot into the Pixel XL design, but there’s one thing you won’t find: an annoying camera bump. The rear camera is completely flush with the glass plate on the back, a design feat that Apple and Samsung have yet to achieve.. Unfortunately, the Google Pixel XL doesn’t live up to those manufacturers' waterproofing standards. Its IP53 rating means you can’t get this one wet, never mind accidentally dunk it in the sink, pool or toilet. That's a deal breaker for the clumsy among us.. On the front, surrounding the 5.5-inch display is a rather big 'chin' for a phone that contains no physical home button. All of the face buttons are on-screen, while the riveted sleep/wake button and smooth volume rocker are on the right side.. It does, however, use that extra room at the top to include a headphone jack. There’s a speaker on the bottom, but while there are two speaker grilles, there’s just one firing out sound. If you accidentally cover it up with your finger (which happens a lot when playing games and watching movies), it kills the volume. It's extremely easy to do holding the phone in landscape mode.. Showing that it does, in fact, have 'personality', the Google Pixel XL colors include Very Silver, Quite Black and Really Blue, a poke at ridiculous phone-color naming conventions.. Really Blue, a limited-edition and, so far, US-only Google Pixel color, sold out within hours of the pre-order launch. Thankfully, Google promised to restock it and it did on December 1. It's not that limited. You may have to join a wait list, depending on your phone configuration of choice.. You’re probably going to get a Live Case to cover up the peculiar glass-and-metal design anyway, so if you can do without a water-resistant phone and stereo speakers, you’ll be fine.. The Google Pixel XL further proves why AMOLED displays look the best for smartphones, thanks to its colorful and bright screen that outclasses LCD panels every time.. It’s vivid and ready for virtual reality on a budget,. the latter being one key reason we’d suggest you upgrade from the normal-sized, 1080p Google Pixel. If you're into VR, big phones and more battery life, this one's for you. The screen looks better than an iPhone 7 Plus, but it’s missing one key feature we like about Apple’s display and newer Samsung and LG handsets: a rise-to-wake or always-on screen.. Having to reach for the tiny, side-mounted sleep/wake button on this phone just to light up the lock screen made us miss this informative display feature.. The rear fingerprint sensor pad (not a button) lights up and unlocks the phone with authentication, too, but that's only useful when it's in your hand, not sitting on a desk. At least give up a double-tap-wake feature to light up the lockscreen.. An Ambient Display modes does lights the screen up in a black-and-white color palette when notifications come in, but it’s just not the same.. Google has finally upgraded its new phone to include a Night Light mode that matches the iOS 9.3 feature. It lacks the adjustable orange-to-blue levels Apple has had from the beginning, and turns from blue to orange rather abruptly at sunset, but it’s a start.. Next Page What’s it like to use?.

No waterproofing, expandable storage, or wireless charging. The Pixel XL has top-notch hardware, the latest Android software, and guaranteed support from Google, making it one of the best big-screen Android phones you can buy.. The Google Pixel XL is a phone with promise. It promises the latest version of Android with guaranteed updates. It promises support for Daydream VR. And it promises a voice assistant to rival Apple's Siri with built-in Google Assistant functionality. Add top-tier hardware to the mix, and you get a winner. Google still needs to deliver on some promises in order to have a five-star product on its hands, but in its current state, the Pixel XL is still one of the best phablets you can buy. It's stands right up there with the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and the LG V20 as an Editors' Choice.. Design, Features, and Display You'd be forgiven for mistaking the Pixel XL for an Apple iPhone 7 Plus at first glance, but a number of differences become apparent close up. It has an attractive metal body, distinct antenna lines, and a camera that sits flush on the back. The back has a panel of glass covering the top half, which adds visual interest. We received the Very Silver version of the XL for review, but it's also available in Really Blue and Quite Black.. The XL is about the same size as most other new phablets. It measures 6.1 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 5.9 ounces, slightly slimmer and lighter than the iPhone 7 Plus (6.2 by 3.1 by 0.3 inches, 6.6 ounces). You can't use either phone one-handed, so if you want a big screen combined with a (relatively) compact build, your only option is the Galaxy S7 Edge (5.9 by 2.8 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces). Or you might want to check out the smaller Pixel , which is essentially the same exact device as the Pixel XL, but with a smaller 5-inch 1080p display.. The Power button is on the right side of the phone, and a volume rocker is right below it. The Power button also launches the camera with a double press. The left side has a SIM card slot. Unlike the S7 Edge and many other Android phones, the Pixel XL lacks a microSD card slot, so you can't expand storage beyond what you get out of the box. The bottom has a USB-C charging port with a speaker and mic on either side. The speaker gets loud, but for the thunderous front-facing pair on the ZTE Axon 7. On the you get a 3.5mm audio jack, something you won't find on the latest iPhone. But the Pixel XL lacks waterproofing and wireless charging, two features you'll find in the S7 Edge.. View All 12 Photos in Gallery. A circular fingerprint scanner sits on the and lets you register five fingerprints with Pixel Imprint. The scanner is fast and responsive, though both the 7 Plus and S7 Edge are a bit quicker in waking and unlocking the screen. On the other hand, the Pixel XL's sensor has some extra functionality thanks to motion gestures, letting you do things like swipe down on the scanner itself to show the notification shade.. The front of the Pixel XL is dominated by a bright and well-calibrated 5.5-inch 2,560-by-1,440 AMOLED display that offers terrific viewing angles. The screen works out to a crisp 534 pixels per inch ( ), making it markedly sharper than the Retina display on the iPhone 7 Plus (401ppi) and on par with the screen on the S7 Edge (534ppi). Visibility outdoors is not , and while the Pixel's AMOLED panel isn't quite a match for Samsung's in terms of color saturation, it still benefits from true black reproduction by lighting pixels only as necessary. A built-in Night Light feature can automatically change the color temperature of the screen at night to make it easier on your eyes.. Left to right: Google Pixel XL, iPhone 7 Plus. Network Performance and Connectivity Our Pixel XL review unit is the one sold through Verizon, but it's technically unlocked and has no branding on its body. It supports GSM (850/900/1800/1900), CDMA (800/1900), HSDPA (850/1700(AWS)/1900/2100), and LTE bands (1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/13/17/20/25/26/28/29/30/41). That means you can use it on every major carrier in the US.. We tested it on Verizon, the winner of our most recent Fastest Mobile Network tests, and saw strong network connectivity. We recorded a top download speed of 40Mbps, very good for a highly congested area. In the less-crowded Jersey City, it registered an even more impressive 64Mbps down. The XL also supports Bluetooth 4.2, dual-band Wi-Fi, and NFC.. Transmissions are clear, with a mild robotic tone that doesn't impact overall clarity. Noise cancellation is strong, but earpiece volume is on the low side.. Processor and Battery The Pixel XL is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor clocked at 2.15GHz. It's a more powerful chipset than the Snapdragon 820 you'll find in most high-end Android phones, though most current benchmarks aren't yet optimized to illustrate the difference. In Geekbench, the Pixel XL scored 1,661 single-core and 4,156 multicore, which isn't much different than the Galaxy S7 (1,695/3,955). Both phones were bested by Apple's blazing A10 Fusion processor in the iPhone 7 Plus (3,463/5,612). JetStream benchmarks, which show how the phone handles advanced Web applications, provide a clearer picture. The Pixel XL scored 53.719, higher than the S7 (41.201).. The XL has 4GB of RAM, which is on par with most other flagship Android phones. Multitasking is fast and smooth and games like GTA: San Andreas and Asphalt 8 are playable without any dropped frames or latency. The phone does seem to run warmer than others we've tested (including the 5-inch Pixel), with noticeable heat radiating from the glass panel on the back, but it has no impact on performance.. See How We Test Cell Phones. Battery life on the XL is good, but not spectacular. In our battery rundown test, in which we stream full-screen video over LTE with screen brightness at maximum, the Pixel XL clocked 6 hours and 43 minutes. That's longer than the iPhone 7 Plus (6 hours), but shorter than the stellar 10 hours the S7 Edge managed in the same test. We charged the phone to full capacity on a Friday night, used it over the weekend without plugging it in, and when Monday rolled around it still had 37 percent left.. Fast charging is supported with the included adapter, which lets you charge the phone to 35 percent in 30 minutes, and fully in 1 hour and 30 minutes. There's also a battery saver mode that tamps down screen brightness and restricts background apps to save power.. Camera The Pixel's XL's 12.3-megapixel rear-facing camera compares surprisingly favorably with two of the best phone cameras on the market, those on the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, despite a lack of optical image stabilization (OIS). Outdoors the XL is a stellar shooter that captures clear, detailed pictures with very little noise or blur. Colors are actually a bit brighter than on the S7, as you can see below. Low-light shooting is also very good, minimizing grain and surpassing the S7 in dimmer settings. The iPhone 7 Plus, on the other hand, does a bit better in low light, favoring denser greens.. The set of shots of the Flatiron Building above shows similar performance between the three phones. They all produce clear and detailed pictures, but the XL edges out the S7 in shadow detail, and the iPhone 7 Plus looks just a hair better than the XL. As for zoom, there's no real comparison. With its 2x telephoto zoom lens, the iPhone 7 Plus takes significantly better close-up pictures than the XL and the S7 do with digital zoom.. Video can be recorded in 4K at up to 30 frames per second. While the XL may not have OIS, which reduces jittering through the physical adjustment of the camera lens, it does have some of the best electronic image stabilization (EIS) we've tested, which uses software. Walking down a lengthy hallway in the PCMag office while recording , the stabilization on the XL came close to matching that of the Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. Video recording is smooth when taking a single long shot, but when panning the camera around or turning, there some artifacts and jerkiness.. The front is home to an 8-megapixel camera. It takes clear, reliable selfies, and works well for video chatting in Duo .. Software, Google Assistant, and 24/7 Help Along with the Pixel, the Pixel XL is the first phone to ship running Android 7.1 Nougat. The differences become clear as soon as you boot up the phone and look at the home screen, which is markedly different from that of any other Android phone on the market.. In some it feels like iOS, including the lack of an app drawer. Instead, you swipe up from the bottom to access all your apps. App icons are redesigned to be circular. And the Pixel is phone with Google Assistant (the company's answer to Siri) built in. It can be accessed a of the home button or simply by saying "OK Google.". Google Assistant allows for a wide range of tasks including making subscriptions to news or weather updates, adding events to your calendar, playing music, launching apps, sending texts, answering general questions, making phone calls, and navigating with Google Maps. More specific queries will often simply return a generic search result. But since the service is based on machine learning, there's plenty of potential for results to get better over time and future integration with Google Home to look forward to.. While you can use Google Assistant on other Android phones through Allo , 24/7 live support is a feature exclusive to the Pixel. We tested this service twice, once right before launch and again a week after. Live chat support via text is accessible and easy to use. The moment we clicked on the Chat button under the Support panel we were told our place in line and connected to a representative within a few minutes. As with most support services, the knowledge and helpfulness of individual representatives can vary. One representative wasn't familiar with a well-known camera lens flare issue, and advised us to factory reset the phone; he also offered a return merchandise authorization and followed up a day later by email.. Support via voice is available 24/7, but you're likely to experience a much longer wait time before you get in touch with a representative. In our case, two attempts at contacting phone support over the weekend initially went unanswered, though we did get a follow-up by email a few days later asking if we still wanted a phone call.. Still, the live support Google provides for the Pixel XL is far better than you'll get from just about any other phone manufacturer. It's rivaled only by Apple's Genius Bar, but then again, you can't access the Genius Bar from the comfort of your home.. In terms of preinstalled apps, the Pixel XL is a pure Google experience. You get Google Launcher, Google Assistant, Google Now, and a full suite of Google apps including Allo, Duo, Google Photos, and many others. For those who buy their phones through Verizon, you'll find three apps preloaded: My Verizon, Message+ , and go90. Overall, on the 32GB model, you're left with 24.43GB. You get unlimited Google Photo cloud storage photos and videos, but considering the lack of a microSD card slot, most users will want to opt for the 128GB model, which brings your price up to $869.. The Pixel's XL bootloader is unlocked, except for the Verizon retail model. That means rooting and installing ROMs is possible; that should allay some fears about Google turning the Pixel into a closed realm.. Conclusions At $769 (or $869 if you go with the 128GB model, which you should), the Google Pixel XL is priced to compete with the highest-end phones on the market. And in most regards, it's a success. The Pixel XL represents a combination of powerful hardware, excellent software with the promise of updates, and extensive customer service support. In theory, it's exactly the phone Google needs to compete with Apple.. But until Google Assistant or Daydream VR becomes a must-have feature, we can't quite give the Pixel XL a full five stars. Some people will prefer the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge for its waterproof design, expandable storage, wireless charging, and longer battery life. Others will want the LG V20 for its removable battery, "secondary" display, and unrivaled audio performance. But w e highly recommend the Pixel XL to any Android user who wants the guarantee of updates and the peace of mind that comes with Google's promised support. That makes it an Editors' Choice.. Bottom Line: The Pixel XL has top-notch hardware, the latest Android software, and guaranteed support from Google, making it one of the best big-screen Android phones you can buy..

The Good The beautifully designed Google Pixel XL features a superb camera, an expansive display and the robust Google Assistant.. The Bad The XL is Google's priciest phone yet. The camera Lens Blur feature needs improvement and it's not as water resistant as its top-tier rivals.. The Bottom Line Get Google's fantastic Pixel XL if you can cough up the cash and simply want more pure Android goodness on a bigger screen.. Wait, what happened to the Nexus?. What's the difference between the Pixel and Pixel XL?. Let's make it official: the Google Pixel XL is the best high-end, super-sized phone on the market. Like its very similar, though smaller and less expensive Pixel sibling, the Pixel XL brings together premium performance, aesthetics, and ergonomics better than any other phone in its class.. It's the Pixel XL's ultra-pure Android Nougat 7.0 experience that gives it the edge over the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge , the previous standard-bearer in the jumbo smartphone category. That -- and its more natural integration with Google's Daydream View VR -- makes the Pixel XL the Android phone to beat.. And given that we likely won't see a new version of it until the spring or summer, or a new iPhone until the fall, the Pixel's place as our favorite phone should be safe for at least the next season or two.. Editors' note : The original Google Pixel XL review, first published in October 2016, follows.. It's the Google Pixel XL's time to shine. With Samsung's $3 billion, exploding Galaxy Note 7 fiasco painfully out of the picture, the 5.5-inch Pixel XL is the premier high-end large-screen phone to get.. Its overall excellent camera and deep integration with Google's new Assistant software give it an edge over the OnePlus 3 and LG V20. Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge remains an outstanding 5.5-inch phone as well, but the Pixel XL (and smaller, somewhat cheaper Pixel ) compels us with that pure, unadulterated Android experience.. I can (and do!) heartily recommend the Pixel XL for large-screen users who want a top-notch camera and pure Android with prompt updates. To save a little cash, opt for the smaller Pixel.. This review answers your major Pixel XL questions, but because both Pixel phones are so incredibly similar, you should read my complete Pixel review for all the nitty-gritty details .. Google's Pixel XL serves up more pure Android goodness. For the past six years, Google partnered up with other phone makers like Motorola, Samsung, and most recently Huawei and LG, to make its Nexus phones. But Google is ditching that sub-brand and starting over. Now, it's folding these two phones into its family of in-house designed products, known as Pixel (which already includes a tablet and laptops ). And though HTC assembled the Pixel phone and Pixel XL together, Google designed and engineered it.. Google's two new phones are nearly identical. The only hardware differences are the XL's larger, sharper display (with a higher pixel density) and bigger battery. It's also pricier, at about $120, £120 and AU$190 more than the Pixel. Everything else, including the processor, camera and design, are the same.. Because there's so little difference, choosing between the two really comes down to size -- if you like a larger phone, get the Pixel XL. Unlike the case of the Apple iPhone 7 and dual-camera iPhone 7 Plus , you won't miss any features by going smaller.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News.

Press enter or click on the search icon. The best version of Android yet. Google Assistant is better than Siri. What is the Google Pixel XL?. Many have questioned Google’s reasoning for taking the direction it has with the Pixel XL. Last year’s Nexus 6P was a great phone at a great price. The Pixel line isn’t about value, however; the focus here is on sheer quality. The Nexus phones, as a result of their price point, were subject to trade-offs here and there – but this isn’t so with the Pixel handsets.. Related: Google Pixel 2 – everything you need to know. So, this isn’t a cheap phone then – and in fact, it matches up closely to what you’d pay for an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus. That’s fine, though, because the Pixel XL is better than an iPhone 7. And for many it’s better than the Samsung Galaxy S7 too.. Google has finally managed to build its “iPhone” – and that should make other Android phone makers very worried indeed.. WATCH: Is the Google Pixel overpriced?. Yes, it’s true: the Google Pixel XL looks like an iPhone. It’s a black (or white or blue) slab of metal, with curved edges and a rear that tapers ever so slightly to help it sit better in your hand; it has also enabled Google to do away with the camera bump, which proves a cause of concern for so many.. Related: Pixel vs Samsung Galaxy S7. The sides chamfer slightly, and while the handset is probably a little thicker than you’d expect – especially if you’ve held a Moto Z – it’s comfortable to hold. Overall, it isn’t actually that much smaller than an iPhone 7 Plus, but it nestles perfectly in my hand and feels so much more manageable than Apple’s hulking beast. A ridged lock switch sits on the side, above a clicky volume rocker.. Although there are flashes of inspired design, overall the focus clearly more about functionality than flashiness. While the front is sparse, the back is a tad more interesting. A glass panel covers the camera and stretches down over the circular fingerprint scanner. This gives the rear of the phone a two-tone look that I actually really like. It’s a fingerprint magnet, however: like the Jet Black iPhone 7, it’s seemingly prone to picking up smudges and abrasions from just looking at it.. I still love having the fingerprint sensor on the back in all situations apart from when the phone is flat on a desk. It’s the natural position where my finger rests when I pick up the phone – and, of course, the lack of the physical home button means it’s really the only place for it to go..

There’s only a “G” logo stencilled onto the back; HTC may have helped Google to build the phone, but there’s no mention of it anywhere.. Buy Now: Google Pixel XL on EE (5GB) – £0 upfront, £47.99/month. The Pixel XL does lack some of the stalwart features we’ve come to expect from a flagship priced phone. There’s no IP68 water-resistance rating of the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7, the powerful speakers of the HTC 10 , or a microSD slot for expanding the 32GB of basic storage.. Related: What is IP68 water-resistance?. While I don’t believe that water-resistance is a necessary requirement, it’s a reassuring feature that I’ve come to appreciate. This is true of stereo speakers, too – they’re not mandatory, but they’re a nice touch.. To be honest, though, the down-firing speaker included here isn’t too bad, but its position means it is easily blocked if playing a game. A microSD card can be found on pretty much every Android phone in 2016, and it’s a shame there isn’t one here.. My main issue with the Pixel XL isn’t the design; it’s the durability of the handset. I’ve been using the phone for a while now and the exterior has already picked up a ding on the corner, even though I haven’t dropped it, and a bevy of scratches to the aforementioned glass panel. I’ve had an iPhone 6S in my pocket for nearly a year and that is yet to scratch at all. Will this become a problem? I’ll have to wait and see.. But this isn’t a design that will rival the Note 7 (R.I.P), nor the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. I think the Moto Z is far more attractive, the OnePlus 3 even more manageable, and the Nexus 6P more eye-catching. It looks better than an iPhone 7, but that’s a tired three-year-old design.. Being the bigger of the two Google phones, the Pixel XL features a larger 5.5-inch display with a 2,650 x 1,440 quad-HD resolution. For those after something smaller, the Pixel boasts a 1080p panel at 5 inches.. But as we already know, resolution doesn’t always guarantee a quality screen. Take the iPhone 7 Plus, for example. It has only a 1080p screen but support for a wide colour gamut and a top-drawer LCD panel make for a fantastic-looking display.. Thankfully, I’ve been pretty impressed by the display here; it matches the Samsung Galaxy S7 as the best on an Android phone.. Like the Galaxy S7, Google has used an AMOLED panel, so right off the bat you’re looking at much richer colours and deeper blacks. The black levels on this phone are great; inky and rich, with no grey discolouration.. Next to an iPhone, you’ll notice how much brighter colours are on the Pixel XL. Apple’s flagships tend to render colour more accurately, while Samsung’s are much brighter and vivid. I’d say that the Pixel XL sits somewhere in-between. Reds are warm and greens can sometimes look a little fluorescent – but for the most part, the Pixel XL reproduces colours as they should be seen.. Viewing angles are great, too, and although this isn’t the brightest screen I’ve seen – that honour easily goes to the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 – it can be jacked up high enough to make it viewable in all conditions.. Big phones have become the norm now and if you’ve ever used an Android phablet then you’ll feel right at home with the Pixel XL.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

Google designed the device from top to bottom, while HTC provided the manufacturing. It shares the same hardware as the Google Pixel, with the exception of the larger display. The Pixel XL comes with a Gorilla Glass 4 coated 5.5" QHD AMOLED display, with a pixel density of 534ppi.

It comes with a choice of either 32GB or 128GB internal storage, though lacks a removable storage slot. The rear shooter has a 12MP sensor, f/2.0 aperture, and 4K video recording, which uses an internal gyroscope for video stablilization, while the front selfie shooter has an 8MP sensor, f/2.0 aperture, and FHD video. The Pixel XL is powered by a non-removable 3450mAh battery, with fast charging capability. Other features include a USB Type-C connector, fingerprint sensor, and an aluminium unibody with a polished glass rear panel.

More than 6 months later, the Google Pixel XL still offers the best Android experience. Google’s Pixel XL is the best Android phone you can buy, hands down..

More expensive than previous Nexus phones. A familiar design with a bit of Google magic. Geekbench 4: 3,945 multi-core, and 1,588 single-core. Assistant is really smart, but it’s not like Her … yet.

Phone Reviews Product Reviews. Update: Google’s Back to School promotion is the best way to buy a Pixel right now, and we’ve added all the details in the pricing and availability section below.. Google’s Pixel XL is the Android phone we’ve always wanted. It’s as gorgeous, powerful, slick, and as easily upgraded as an. It’s the best Android phone of 2016 hands down. One question remains: Should you still entertain the thought of buying it more than six months after its initial release?. Maybe it was that new phone feeling or the subtle little G for Google on the back of the phone, but the Pixel XL has a magic quality about it. This is it! The first Google Phone!. Just like the majority of Android phones these days, the Pixel’s body is mostly aluminum. It looks like a cross between an iPhone and the Huawei Honor 8 , thanks to a. mixed media design that uses metal and glass; it’s high-end with nice texture. The phone feels silky smooth against your fingers and provides an interesting contrast of materials.. Of course, there are two huge problems with glass: It picks up fingerprints and it’s very fragile. Luckily, the glass panel is small and located up at the top of the phone, so you’re not likely to touch it too much. It picks up fingerprints, but not as many as a Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S7. The part that gathers the most smudges and starts to look funky is the fingerprint sensor, which is also coated in glass.. The glass doesn’t reach all the way up to the edge of the phone, so it shouldn’t crack if you drop it on its corners. However, if it falls at a weird angle or plunges to the concrete glass-face-first, it’ll crack — and probably be a pain to replace.. We’re not really fans of glass-backed phones, so we’re glad the Pixel is mostly metal. Still, you’ll probably want a case if you’re a klutz or you hate fingerprints. Luckily, Google lets you design your own Live Case with art, maps, or your own photos for $40.. As far as comfort goes, the Pixel XL may be a big 5.5-inch phone, but it is comfortable to hold. It’s about the same size as the iPhone 7 Plus, but a little thicker and shorter. The phone’s edges have a slight ridge to them for added grip, and the metal feels sturdy. The volume rocker and power button are easy to locate and press, and the power button has a nice texture to it so you can tell which button is which.. For ports, there’s a headphone jack at the top of the phone, a SIM card slot on the left side, and a USB Type-C port at the bottom along with the speakers. After a few months with the jackless iPhone 7 Plus, it was nice to plug our trusty headphones right into the 3.5mm jack. It’s so weird to find it at the top of the phone, though. Google made one hell of a phone. After more than six months of using the phone every single day, we have yet to run into any serious stutters or hiccups with the way it performs. The sharp Quad HD screen with its 5.5-inch size and 2,560 × 1,440 pixel resolution looks great. It looks gorgeous next to the screen on the. and less over-saturated than the Galaxy S7 Edge .. The Pixel XL runs silky smooth too. Apps open quicker than ever; moving between home screens is smooth and fast; and content loads and scrolls without any stutters on apps like Twitter and Chrome. That’s not just thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip powering the device — it’s also thanks to the deep software optimizations. Of course, phones like the Snapdragon 835 offer slightly faster performance at this point — but that’s due to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chip, which is simply newer and faster.. Google’s Pixel XL is the Android phone we’ve always wanted.. When we first set up the phone, we downloaded 20 plus apps and dozens of songs for offline listening all while using the phone and setting up apps. The Pixel didn’t have a single problem through all this stress testing, though it started getting pretty hot. It eventually got so hot that it stalled for a few minutes and we had to restart it. We had a similar heat episode when we first got our standard Pixel, but it also disappeared.. Since then, we’ve had zero problems with it, and it doesn’t run hot during ordinary use. That’s all thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 and the 4GB of RAM. The Pixel comes with 32GB of internal storage, and there’s a 128GB variant as well — sadly, there is no MicroSD card slot. However, you get unlimited photo storage with Google Photos at full resolution on the Pixel, so you should be set.. In case you want some benchmarks, we put the Pixel XL through a bunch of them:. In comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S7 scored 134,203 on the AnTuTu test and the LG G5. The Pixel XL runs slightly ahead of two big Android competitors from 2016. Meanwhile, the iPhone 7 has an AnTuTu score of 178,397, which clearly blows every Android phone out of the water. The A10 Fusion chip from Apple is sure to perform better, but benchmarks aren’t the end-all and be-all of performance. You’ll be more than satisfied with what the Pixel offers.. Android O is coming! In late March, Google unveiled the Developer Preview of the next version of its smartphone operating system. It’s not officially released yet, so consumers are best off sticking to the current version of Android, but intrepid enthusiasts looking for the latest and greatest can download and manually install the next-gen software today.. Meanwhile, even with the current Android Nougat, there’s nothing like pure Android on a Pixel phone. Finally, we see a true marriage of hardware and software on one Google-made device. Android has never run smoother or looked better. The Pixel has a special launcher and unique features that you won’t find on any other Android phone. The entire experience is very polished.. There’s no longer an icon for the app drawer, but you can still see all your apps with a single swipe up from the bottom of the screen. The lack of the app drawer icon unclutters the main interface, too. So all you see are the back, home, and multitasking icons.. The Google search bar is artfully hidden, too. To access it, you just tap on the colorful G logo in the upper corner. Out pops your search bar and the microphone for voice queries. Google Now cards are also just a swipe away, as always. It feels more like iOS than ever before, so even long-time iPhone users will feel at home.. Elegant design tweaks continue throughout the interface, including several that won’t be available on other Android phones when Android 7.1 drops. The new caller ID screen, the black notification drawer with a blue brightness slider, and the blue accents throughout the OS, like in the Settings menu, are exclusive to the Pixel.. One of the more interesting additions is Quick Actions, which is similar to 3D Touch on iOS. Press and hold an icon and you’ll get shortcuts like “New Incognito Tab” on Chrome. You’ll have to wait for developers to add shortcuts for their apps, as right now only a handful of Google apps utilize the API.. There’s nothing quite like Pure Android on a Pixel phone.. Android also now has a native night mode called Night Light. It removes blue hues from your screen to help you sleep. This is one of my personal favorite additions. It’s just like Night Shift Mode on iOS, and it works just as well to help your eyes rest at night. You can also turn on fingerprint gestures on the device, so you can bring down the full notification drawer with two swipes. We don’t want to see this feature bloated with all sorts of gestures, but it would be killer if you could scroll a webpage or ask via the sensor on the back.. Android 7.0 brought better functionality to the OS, and 7.1 refines on them further. Pixel offers the most fluid Android experiences we’ve seen to date.. If you haven’t noticed, the navigation buttons are now solid white on the Pixel. There’s also a ring around the home button, and that’s to let you know that Google Assistant is available. Assistant is Google’s artificially intelligent bot that can help you with almost anything: search queries, checking your emails, translating text into other languages, and more. It’s essentially a more personalized Google Now, and it learns from you the more you use it.. One of our favorite features is “My Day,” which you can trigger by saying “good morning,” once you’ve activated Assistant (say “Okay Google” or long-press the home button). Assistant will then read out your daily schedule, the weather, and more, but the best part is that it will automatically launch a playlist of news podcasts — ours started with NPR’s morning briefing, and continued with Fox News and so on.. It’s one of those features you don’t know you need until you try it.. While at launch you could only talk with Assistant, you can also now type to it as well, thanks to the little keyboard icon on the bottom left of the screen. That’s pretty helpful — you’re not always in a position to talk to your phone, and being able to type means you can still talk to Assistant when that’s the case.. Google has been increasing Assistant’s capabilities since launch — you can now control your smart home appliances with Assistant on the phone, for example, and soon you’ll be able to get context from the images you see with Google Lens .. You can’t go wrong with a high-end smartphone camera these days — they’re all pretty fantastic. The Pixel XL’s 12.3-megapixel camera with larger 1.55 micron pixels is outstanding. It takes splendid shots that rival the Galaxy S8 Edge , LG G6 , and iPhone 7 Plus. It focuses super quickly and processes the automatic HDR+ mode with incredible speed.. We were blown away with the level of detail in photos. In one close up of a bee on a flower, you can see the detail of its tiny iridescent wings and fuzzy body when you zoom in on the picture. That’s not something we’ve seen from a lot (any) phones before. We were also favorably impressed with the shots we took of an underground garden at Lowline Labs in NYC.. Like many other Android phones, the Pixel XL does tend to boost the colors and saturation in images for a more heightened effect. The resulting images are more natural looking than what you’d get with a Galaxy S7 Edge, but less natural than images taken with the iPhone 7 Plus. A few shots turned out more blue than they really appeared in reality, but not by too much.. In low-light scenarios, images are more colorful and bright, but a little less sharp than images shot on the. Several features in the camera app are exclusive to the Pixel, such as a manual exposure slider, focus lock, tap-to-focus, and white balance — more options are always a good thing, but is it too much to ask for a timelapse setting? It is noticeably absent.. In daylight, you’ll hardly ever have an issue with the camera, and the manual exposure option is a godsend for those times when the lighting is tricky. You can also use SmartBurst to capture multiple photos at once, or make a GIF.. There’s even a fun lens blur feature that mimics the effect you get from the dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus with a nifty blurred background. You select lens blur from the hamburger menu in the camera app, take the picture, and then you have to move your phone slowly upward with rock steady hands. Keeping it steady is hard, and we often failed to capture the image on time. However, the blurring did turn out well when we managed to do it right.. We were blown away with the level of detail in photos taken with the Pixel XL.. The iPhone 7 Plus’ camera wins against the Pixel XL on a few fronts: 2× hardware zoom, natural colors, and effortless lens blur DSLR-style effects. However, with ordinary use, the two cameras are more or less equal based on our initial testing.. When it comes to video, the Pixel can take 4K videos at 30 frames-per-second, though the new feature is the gyro stabilization technique. It grabs gyro data about 200 times a second for so you end up with a smoother video. Videos are indeed smooth and shake-free, but you have to watch out when you turn — they tend to look a little too mechanical, as though a robot was swiveling in place. If you make sure you turn slowly, it doesn’t look as robotic.. The icing on the cake of an already excellent camera is unlimited full-resolution Google Photos storage in the Photos app. It’s a Pixel exclusive, so all your Android-using friends should be deeply envious. Unlimited photo storage means you should be fine with 32GB of storage on the Pixel XL — unless you download tons of music, videos, and big apps.. Most phones last about a day to a day and a half and the Pixel XL is no exception. On the first day, I killed the battery very quickly because I couldn’t put the Pixel down. Once I cooled my jets, the battery life started to even out to around a day. You’ll always have to charge it up at night, putting it more or less in the same boat as the iPhone 7 Plus and the Galaxy S8.. It does have quick charging tech with that USB Type-C port. I love charging my phone up to nearly full in about 15 minutes. It’s brilliant, albeit common on Android. The iPhone 7 Plus doesn’t have that party trick.. Google offers a standard one-year warranty on the Pixel XL. You can sign up for device protection for $100, but you won’t have to worry about high repair costs after damaging your phone. You’ll also get a replacement device as quickly as one business day after your claim is approved. To file a claim through Google’s partner Assurant, just call or go to mydeviceprotect.com. Each claim is subject to a deductible — $80 for Pixel and $100 for Pixel XL — and you can file up to two claims of accidental damage coverage within the 2-year term.. Google Pixel XL Compared To. Quick repairs and replacements aren’t the only perks you get if you buy the Pixel XL. Much like Apple does with the iPhone, Google offers 24/7 support for your Pixel, in case you run into any issues. You can do this by visiting the Settings menu, and you can trigger a call or start a chat with a specialist. When you’re having more serious problems, you can share your screen to help get issues resolved faster. Once you give your number to support in the Settings app under Support, you’ll get a call from Google. We spoke with a Google support rep over the phone to see how the experience works. The rep was helpful and answered all our questions just like Apple’s support staff does in stores and online.. It’s an excellent idea to offer customer support right on the device. It really puts the Pixel ahead of most Android phones.. Even more important that customer service, the Pixel smartphones, like the Nexus line, also gets fast security and Android version updates from Google. The updates automatically download when you’re not using your device (like at night), so that you never have to wait around for the new software to download or for it to finally arrive on your device.. That means you’ll never be vulnerable to security flaws or hacks for extended periods of time because necessary patches will arrive immediately, and you’ll get new features first.. Millions of Android phones are still vulnerable to hacks like Stagefright and Heartbleed, which allow hackers to remotely take over your device, steal passwords, and check out your private information. Google is doing the right thing with its Pixel phones and all of its partners should take notice. Timely updates give the Pixel XL a leg up over the competition, as carriers and manufacturers are typically slow in issuing updates.. Surprisingly, Verizon has come out and said it will not “stand in the way” of updates — your device will get it straight from Google, even if you buy it from Verizon.. Since release, the Pixel phones have proven popular and, unfortunately, very difficult to find. Nearly a year later, Google finally appears to have a stable stock going —. on the horizon, the firm has already started. The discounts on offer as part of Google’s. The phone is a Verizon carrier exclusive, but you can buy it unlocked from Google and use it on any network. Google offers a payment plan where you pay the phone’s total cost in monthly installments over two years.. The Pixel XL (and standard Pixel if you want a smaller phone) is our favorite Android phone, and the best one you can buy right now.. There are a few phones out there that seriously give the Pixel XL a run for its money, notably the Samsung Galaxy S8. While more powerful than the Pixel XL, the other devices don’t offer the same stock Android experience, nor do they offer timely security and version updates.. The Pixel XL is the best Android phone we’ve ever used and the only one that has ever come this close to dethroning the iPhone. If you’re cheap, on a budget, and don’t care about things like software updates and customer support, you’re welcome to check out the ZTE Axon 7. or the OnePlus 5 , both of which offer similar or better specs for about $200 to $300 less. However, if you want the best Android experience, buy the Pixel XL.. If you’re on the fence between the iPhone 7 Plus and the Pixel XL, you can’t go wrong with either. They are the two best phones that you can buy today — period. There’s also always something new on the horizon in the tech industry, so do keep in mind that the Pixel 2 is likely coming in October and you may be able to find the 2016 Pixel at a lower price.. The Pixel XL should last you at least two to three years. Since it gets automatic software updates and security patches directly from Google, it is the most future-proof Android phone on the market.. This is the Android phone we’ve been waiting for. This is the one to buy — but do get it unlocked from the Google Play Store. We’ve come to love the Pixel for every day use, and Google has proven that Assistant is a serious contender in the digital assistant space. We also have yet to run into any serious performance issues — even after six months of use. This is a great phone — but if you’re in no rush to buy, you may want to wait for the second-generation Pixel, which will come out later this year.. Update: More than six months after its initial release, we take a look to see if the Google Pixel XL is still a serious competitor.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

Google Pixel XL review: a Pixel’s perspective. by Nirave Gondhia October 27, 2016. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Excellent camera with HDR+ and ES.

However, if youâre interested in the Pure Android experience as Google imagines it, you need not worry as the Google Pixel and Pixel XL bring with them many of the same characteristics.. Offering a Pure Android experience coupled with the new AI-based Google Assistant, does the Pixel XL have enough to stand out against a plethora of smartphones, both running Android and not? Will the generic design deter users away from Googleâs flagship or should you look past it to any goodies that may lie within?. With the Galaxy Note 7 now consigned to an early death, are the Pixel and Pixel XL the perfect replacement? Letâs find out in this, our Google Pixel and Pixel XL review.. In this review, we’ve focused on the experience offered by the Pixel XL as it is almost identical on the Pixel, apart from the display size, resolution and battery capacity. We’ll be following this up with a further look at the Pixel to see if these differences impact the overall experience.. Originally we published our first impressions of the Pixel XL as we weren’t ready to give a final verdict on Google’s new smartphones just yet. You can check out our Pixel XL initial review and then come back here for Josh and Lanh’s video above and Nirave’sÂ. Letâs address the elephant in the room â the Pixel XL is basically the closest youâll ever come to an iPhone running Android. Somewhere in Cupertino, thereâs likely to be a team of lawyers pouring over Googleâs latest flagship and looking at every patent, which is likely what Google did when coming up with this design.. By way of comparison, the Nexus line-up has always offered quirky, unique designs (though sometimes closely inspired by Google’s partner OEMs designs) that stood out amongst a sea of competition, and the generic design of the Pixel XL removes this. The front especially doesnât stand out at all, and you could easily mistake it for another generic smartphone, especially with the bottom chin beneath the display essentially being wasted space.. The design itself is almost certain to be the most polarizing element of the Pixel XL and personally, Iâm on the fence. While the design was generic at first, it has definitely grown on me but at the same time, I do miss the quirky design of the Galaxy Note 7 and S7 Edge. With so many Android smartphones on the market, Google is largely relying on its marketing push and word of mouth to help the Pixel XL stand out as itâs unlikely many users will pick this handset based on its design.. You might like: Best Google Pixel XL Cases. On the back, thereâs a combination of a matte metal finish and a glossy plastic finish in the upper half of the back, and itâs an eclectic combination, which leaves a lot to the imagination. The matte part of the finish provides welcome grip while the glossy part adds one of the few elements that make the Pixel XL stand out. The back also houses the fingerprint sensor, which is rather snappy but more on that later, and Googleâs G logo, which replaces the Nexus logo of old.. Moving around the rest of the phone and on the right, youâve got the power and volume buttons, which are quite stiff, yet easy to press. On the left, youâve got the single SIM card tray and for those used to dual SIM and/or microSD card expansion on other Android phones, neither of these is available on the Pixel XL. Up top is the headphone jack while at the bottom is the USB Type-C port, single speaker and microphone.. The build of the Pixel XL leaves a lot to be desired for me; despite not being dropped at all since Iâve had it, there are a few dents on the body already and a couple of scratches as well. In a bid to ensure the software and camera elements are great, it does seem that Google has cut corners with the design, at least in my opinion, and honestly, I wouldnât expect these concerns from a flagship, let alone one that costs as much as the Pixel XL does.. itâs not flashy and it doesnât seem attractive to a lot of people, until you turn it on and a lot of goodness comes out of it.. Say what you like, the Nexus range could always be relied upon to offer a unique experience and if Google is opting for generic designs for the Pixel range going forward, this could pose a rather big problem. Many would say the iPhone has a generic design but thatâs actually become a big strength and from generic, itâs now become iconic. It remains to be seen whether the Pixel XL design language in its current form can become iconic but from my time with the handset, I think Google needs to tweak it at least a bit more with the next generation. itâs not flashy and it doesnât seem attractive to a lot of people, until you turn it on and a lot of goodness comes out of it.. The main difference between the smaller Pixel and the larger Pixel XL is the display, with the larger handset sporting a 5.5-inch Quad HD AMOLED display. Sporting 2560×1440 resolution and a pixel density of 534 pixels per inch, itâs a bright, vibrant panel thatâs a joy to use, even in outdoor conditions. Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection also helps to protect the handset so the display should survive a bump or two, even if the actual build may look worse for wear.. Running the Pixel XL’s AMOLED display through our display tests reveals a slightly cooler color temperature of 7859 Kelvin, which essentially means the screen has a blue tint. Interestingly, at least according to our spectrophotometer readings, the when the display is set to the standard mode (rather than the default adaptive mode), it scoresÂ. 7131k, which is much more accurate compared to the recommended temperature of 6500k.. Anything you want to do on this phone, you wonât be disappointed.. A max brightness of 420 nits, even under direct light, doesn’t quite tell the full story as although the Pixel XL has a lower max brightness than other devices, there are no noticeable legibility issues in direct sunlight. Overall, I’d have to agree with Lanh when he saysÂ. anything you want to do on this phone, you wonât be disappointed.. Under the hood, the Pixel XL is powered by the latest Snapdragon 821 chipset â which features 2 high-power Kryo cores at 2.15GHz and 2 high-efficiency cores at 1.6GHz) alongside 4GB of RAM and an Adreno 530 GPU. With this package, the Pixel XL is mostly future proof, at least until Qualcommâs next flagship chipset â expected to be the Snapdragon 830 â lands next year.. Before getting into the actual real world performance, letâs see how the package stacks up against the flagship processors inside the competition, including the A10 Fusion chipset powering the iPhone 7 Plus.. First up in our benchmark tests is GeekBench 3, which tests a phone’s ability to handle various CPU-intensive tasks, and the Pixel XL scores 2234 in the single-core test and 5054 in the multi-core test. Turning back time, it’s easy to see how vastly improved the Snapdragon 821 is over the Snapdragon 810 chipset inside the Nexus 6P, which scores 1282 and 4212 respectively. Qualcomm’s latest processor does fall slightly short of the new A10 Fusion chipset inside the iPhone 7 Plus, which scores 3419 and 5395 and Samsung’s Exynos 8890-powered Galaxy S7 Edge, which scores 2107 and 6397.. Next up is AnTuTu which combines CPU testing with an element of GPU testing and is a great way of testing all round performance. In this test, the Pixel XL scores 136883, which puts it high above the A10 FusionÂ. (114975) and Exynos 8890 (127507) but it does fall slightly short of the Snapdragon 820-powered Xiaomi Mi 5, which scores 142084.. Lastly, we come to heavier GPU testing, with the Adreno 530 GPU inside the Pixel XL scoring 2476Â. in 3DMark’s Slingshot test (using ES 3.1). By way of comparison, this is higher than the iPhone 7 Plus’s A10 Fusion chipset (2210), the Exynos 8890 inside the Samsung Galaxy S7 EdgeÂ. (2187) and is on par with theÂ. Snapdragon 820 that powers the LG G5 (2447). Qualcomm’s Adreno GPU has always led the benchmark tests (versus the Mali GPU used in most other chipsets) and this certainly seems to continue with the Snapdragon 821.. Overall, the benchmarks show the Pixel XL has a computing packageÂ. that’s on par, if not better, than the oneÂ. it chief rivals but as we’ve seen previously, benchmarks scores don’t necessarily reflect real world performance.. If anything, any performance gap feels larger than the benchmarks would have you believe as the Pixel XL is probably the fastest smartphone Android to-date. As Josh found in our initial review, this is one very rapid smartphone and, even with the storage on my entire handset completely full, the handset barely showed any signs of slowing down.. Josh makes a great point that while the power and performance of the chipset makes a different, Google deserves credit for paying proper attention to detail and I canât help but agree. On previous Nexus devices, there has always been small delays in parts of the OS resulting in a slow and sluggish experience but with the Pixel XL, everything is super smooth and this feels fast.. The best example of this is the multi-tasking as it takes just a split second to flip between the most recent application using the new shortcut of double tapping the button. More on the software side of things later but I will say that while stock Android was known for offering the smoothest experience possible, this feels like the first time that an Android OEM has managed to truly match the performance found on the iPhone.. Because of the Snapdragon 821, and because of Pure Android itself, this is one of the most reliable and smoothest experiences out there. Usually the iPhone has lesser hardware but Apple manages to produce performance thatâs on par with anything else through vertical integration of the hardware and software, and Google is the first manufacturer to be able to come close to this. As Lanh says, “ it really goes to show what Google can do when it has control over both the hardware and the software “, while Josh echoes this by saying “ because of the Snapdragon 821, and because of Pure Android itself, this is one of the most reliable and smoothest experiences out there. On the hardware front, the Pixel XL definitely seems to be on par with most flagships, save for the lack of microSD card expansion. Thereâs two storage options â 32GB and 128GB â and while you do get unlimited full resolution uploads to Google Photos with either Pixel, youâll likely want to grab the 128GB version. In just 10 days, Iâve managed to use up 25GB of the 29.7GB available out of the box albeit this was without having backups to Google Photos turned on.. Having full uploads to Google Photos enabled coupled with automatic backups when connected to WiFi and charging makes it rather simple to always ensure the images have been synced to Googleâs servers. When you do run low on space, Assistantâs Free Up Space feature checks which images on your phones have been backed up and can then delete them from local storage to free up space. As long as youâve got an internet connection, youâll still be able to see and access those images in the Photos app, but it’s quite slow, especially on a mobile data connection.. Storage aside, the Pixel XL does come with a plethora of hardware features youâd expect to see on a flagship smartphone in 2016, including LTE Cat 12 , dual-band Wi-Fi n/ac, Bluetooth v4.2, NFC and a reversible USB Type-C 3.0 connector.. Also onboard in a fingerprint sensor on the rear, which is slightly larger than most fingerprint sensors used on other Android smartphones. Like the sensors in Huawei handsets, the Pixel XL also supports a swipe-down gesture that lets you quickly pull down your notification panel and while you wonât use it all the time, itâs definitely a nice feature to have. The fingerprint sensor is also rather quick to unlock your handset and seems to work almost all the time, although sometimes itâs possible to remove your finger before itâs been recognised. That being said, youâll most likely find it the simplest way to unlock your phone, especially as you can unlock and wake the phone from sleep using just your fingerprint.. Durability is fast becoming a feature found on most flagship handsets, but while most devices seem to have an IP6X rating for proper dust and water resistance, the Pixel XL is rated at just IP53. What does this mean in real world usage? Itâs rather simple â while the iPhone 7 Plus and Galaxy S7 Edge should survive a drop in the toilet or being caught in a heavy rainstorm, the Pixel XL most likely wonât. If youâre someone whoâs broken a phone thanks to the liquid damage before and need this level of protection, the Pixel XL definitely doesnât deliver.. While the hardware certainly seems to be on par with most flagship devices, it definitely seems that Google has stuck to the bare minimum. A software and services company at heart, this definitely shows as the Pixel XL relies on software elements to make up for any deficiencies in the hardware. The problem for Google is that charging a large amount for a flagship and then offering the bare minimum hardware isnât a combination that entices users and against something like the Galaxy S7 Edge, which offers much better hardware at a similar price, the Pixel XL definitely comes up short.. Under the hood, thereâs a 3,450mAh battery powering the entire Pixel XL experience, which is slightly more than the 3,000mAh unit inside the Pixel. The extra capacity doesnât deliver any different battery life (thanks to the larger, denser display) and Josh, Lanh and I have all had mixed results when it comes to the battery life.. Lanhâs handset generally lasts an entire day and consistently achieves around 5 hoursâ screen on time, even with very heavy usage. Meanwhile, the battery life on Joshâs handset is on the lower end of the average, with around 4 hoursâ screen on time, again from a day of heavy usage.. Myself, Iâve been very impressed by the Pixel XL battery life; as someone who travels quite regularly, I usually run into the problem of bad signal abroad, which in turn has a marked impact on battery life. During the past 10 days, Iâve been in China and Hong Kong, and only on one occasion did the Pixel XL fail to last an entire day.. That particular day was when I spent many hours taking photos using the camera with the screen mostly on medium to full brightness, and while I only average around 5 hoursâ screen on time as well, Iâm less worried. Simply put; Iâm so used to having to manage battery when using other Android phones (ahem, in particularly the Galaxy S7 Edge) that itâs rather refreshing not having to really worry about the battery on the Pixel XL.. Putting the handset through our custom battery testing app, we found the gaming battery life to be 4 hours and 45 minutes, which is on par with the experience weâve all had. Of course, factors such as display brightness, how many apps are syncing in the background and how much youâre using the phone definitely impact on battery life but most, if not all, users should easily be able to get through an entire dayâs usage.. For the times when you are running low, the Pixel XL supports rapid charging and within 30 minutes, youâll find you can add up to 40 percent battery, although the whole thing does take around 2 hours to charge, which is definitely slower than Qualcommâs own QuickCharge solution. Either way, Rapid Charging definitely helps to top up the battery when youâve only got a limited amount of time.. At the launch of the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google focused on five key selling points for its flagship handsets, with the camera one of the key messages. Google claims the Pixel XL has the highest DxOMark rating for any smartphone (with a score of 89)Â. but as we’ve seen previously, it doesn’t always reflect what’s most pleasing to the eye. As it stands, the Pixel XL camera definitely seems to live up to Google’s claims, mostly.. Josh, Lanh and I all agree that in daylight, the images are very sharp, very well detailed and the camera has excellent dynamic range. in the HDR+ mode that does a great job of toning down the highlight and shadows, without making the images look unnatural or fake. Thanks to HDR on the sensor (rather than in post processing as with previous Nexus devices), the processing is the best part with the camera taking next to no time to process an image rather than the slower experience found onÂ. Over the past 10 days, I’ve been travelling to Hong Kong and China and the Pixel XL has not let me down, proving time and time again to be a very reliable performer. Images are incredibly sharp in almost all conditions and while the lack of manual controls doesn’t give you much flexibility in adjusting your shots, touch-to-focus focus on a subject and adjusts for the conditions rapidly and the exposure slider gives you more EV levels than most Android devices.. In lowlight, the camera also continues to deliver, although it does have a few chinks in its armor. The biggest of these is the lack of Optical Image Stabilisation as while the ES (Electronic Stabilisation) does deliver somewhat, you need to keep your hands perfectly still otherwise you’ll likely end up with a noisy image full of grain. During my time with the Pixel XL, I’ve found that while the low light performance isn’t the best, most of the time, the photos are still good enough to share on social which is all most people will use it for.. Moving on and Google used the use case ofÂ. of video recording to tout the benefits of its unique approach to stabilisation. Rather than OIS which adds elements to the sensor itself, ES relies on information from the gyroscope to correct your shot and results have been mostly positive.. During my trip, I found the handset was capable of shooting incredibly still video when moving in a car – although occasionally it does compensate for the wrong element resulting in rather warped video – or even on a harbour cruise.Â. Meanwhile Josh took the Pixel XL for a spin to test out whether it could be used as a vlogging smartphone and found while the ES is able to compensate for general movement and possibly if you’re walking, it won’t perform miracles with more sporadic movement, such as if you tried to record while running. As he put it, you end up getting a video that’s searching for the place to stabilise but doesn’t really find it.. Google has made a camera that makes it easy for anyone to take great pictures.. Overall there’s no doubt that the camera in the Pixel and Pixel XL is vastly improved over the competition and in the end, Google has made a camera that makes it easy for anyone to take great pictures. Offering excellent speed – even when using the double press of the power button shortcut to launch the camera – incredible photos and good video recording, there’s no doubt that this smartphone camera is on par with the very best. As Lanh puts it, “ Google has gone from having the worst to the best cameras in a phone and I would say the Pixel phones are easily in the top 3 for smartphone image quality. The Pixel and Pixel XL run the latest Android 7.1 Nougat OS out of the box – along with all the goodies it brings – with Google’s new Pixel Launcher on top. The Pixel Launcher, new in its own right, is the evolution of the Google launcher and brings with it a revamped-yet-familiar user experience with Google Assistant and a few minorÂ. changes that have a huge impact on the overall user experience.. By far, the biggest selling point for the Pixels is Google Assistant, Google’s new AI-based voice assistant that offers some incredible features. The same assistant that powers Google Allo – but now available through all the Android interface – it is only availableÂ. the Pixel and Pixel XL, at least in its current form. much-smarter version of Google Now and allows you to communicate with Google using more conversational speech patterns.. The ability to be more conversational means you can say a lot more to it, you can joke with it and you can even ask it to read you a poem. The basics haven’t been forgotten either, as you can also use it for the basics, such as setting a timer, checking the calendar, the weather, sports scores or more. For those that often have a full diary, the daily briefing feature allows you to digest your agenda for the day ahead alongside other information,Â. without having to do much other than set it up and say Good Morning. It’s a really, really useful feature and is also available in Google Home which might be more practical over your morning coffee.. At first, I was skeptical of how useful Google AssistantÂ. would be – after all, voice assistants haven’t really delivered on their promise in the past – and some poor voice recognition aside (or was Google trolling me about Siri?), it’s actually a really great experience. Both Josh and I agree that the hotword (Ok, Google) is a great way to unlock your phone and fire up the search before having a conversation; for example, during my travels it was the easiest way to look up exchange rate information, search for things nearbyÂ. and find out the weather or time anywhere in the world, all with a few well-chosen words.. Of course it’s not all perfect and there’s still many features we’d like to see added or better implemented. We’ll be going into Google Assistant in a more in-depth feature in the near future, but hte big takeaway is its a good feature to have that should hopefully only get better with time.. The Pixel Launcher also brings with new icon packs, which means most apps are now displayed with a circle background on the icon. Some apps do continue to have their own designs and, short of Google forcing each app to opt for a circle background, this is unlikely to change but overall, it brings more uniformity to the overall experience. It’s not perfect, but it’s a huge step in the right direction and at least all of the apps are now the same size.. There’s also a few minor features which heavily improve the usability of the Pixels, and the biggest of these is a reboot/restart option. Google has left it out of stock Android all these years but it’s a feature that, literally, saves you time so it’s great to see it finally baked into stock Android.. is similar to Apple’s 3DTouch, minus the 3DTouch and allows you to long press an application to access certain functions (such as sending a message via the messages icon or sending a new email via Gmail) without having to open the application. One odd occurrence I personally noticed was, although it’s natively supported in Android 7.1, it’s only Google’s apps that currently support the long press feature:Â. if you have another launcher set as the default launcher, the feature doesn’t work until you setÂ. Google Assistant is a wonderful layer on top of Android 7.1. The Pixel and Pixel XL are exclusive to Verizon – unless you buy them unlocked – which brings with it carrier bloat as you might expect but Google definitely seems to have had a hand in limiting the amount of bloatware installed on the handset. There’s only a few choice apps and these can all be uninstalled leaving you with a stock experience. With Google also updating the Pixels directly – rather than letting Verizon issue updates – and promising to keep them up-to-date for two years, the Pixels are likely to keep offering a clutter-free excellent experience. As Josh puts it, “Google Assistant is a wonderful layer on top of Android 7.1” and we’re hoping it’s available on all Android 7.1 smartphones, regardless of OEM.. the Pixel and Pixel XL is the price, with Google pricing these smartphones at the same price as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus respectively. To own the Pixel XL is going to cost you a large amount of money and with the handset also exclusive to Verizon, your carrier options are also rather limited.. Both devices are available in three colors – Really Blue, Quite Black, Very Silver –Â. at a cost of $699 for the 32GB Pixel and $799 for the 32GB Pixel XL. If the 128GB version is more your style, youâll need to add $120 to the price, making them $819 and $919 respectively. For those wanting to use it on another carrier, the handsets do come unlocked so you’re able to use them on any carrier after you’ve bought them.. Thereâs no doubt that if you want the Pixel or the Pixel XL, youâll definitely be paying a premium for having access to Googleâs latest experience. The question youâre probably asking right now is â should you buy either?. If money is no object, then you can't go wrong with either of Google's new smartphones.. Personally, Iâm torn as they’re bothÂ. great phones and the compromises are few and far between, but the biggest is the price tag. On paper, it doesnât quite offer as much as other flagship devices but what it does do, it does exceptionally well. The camera makes it easy for anyone to take incredible photos in a pinch while Google Assistant is excellent, when itâs not trolling you that is. If money is no object, then you can’t go wrong with either of Google’s new smartphones.. possibly, two of the best Android smartphones ever made. It’s a new direction for Google but it’s worked and if you want the best from Google, the Pixel phones are what you’re getting for 2016; they won’t disappoint you as they are possibly, two of the best Android smartphones ever made. As the first generation of Google’s new approach to hardware, they give us a lot to look forward to and we’re all excited to see how much better its going to get from here..

This is a BETA experience. You may opt-out by clicking here. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. Google went big with its new Pixel smartphones. Gone are the days of the bland Nexus upgrades. In their stead is a new device(s) that looks much more like a premium handset with thoughtful design. Not to mention some heavyweight features like the best-in-class camera and free unlimited media storage, to name two. But, as we always do, we have to ask: is it worth your money?. If you’re not familiar with my buying guides then check my run downs for the iPhone 7 , iPhone 7 Plus ,. Sony Xperia XZ and Samsung Galaxy Note 7 .. The biggest surprise of the new Pixel phones is that. The highest score any smartphone’s camera has *ever* received. Google’s previous Nexus handsets have struggled in the camera department, veering from very good to quite average. The high-score was justified when I tried the camera out in a brief hands-on. Two things stood out from the 12.3MP snapper: the shutter speed and how well it exposed back-lit scenes. The former being the most impressive given that HDR (or ‘HDR plus’) is turned on by default and there’s no apparent shutter lag. Picture quality, noise reduction (it was a dark room) and color reproduction all looked impressive. We’ll know more in the full review, but it looks like this - combined with impressive video stabilization - is the game-changer Google’s smartphones have needed for a while.. The Google Assistant is essentially a friendlier face of Google Now. dressed up as an entirely "new" entity (although Google Now still technically exists). But if you take out Google’s hyperbole, the. makes the personal assistant a far better proposition and adds some better functionality.. One improvement is that Assistant can hold a two-way conversation with you. So if you ask a question such as "What Italian restaurants are nearby?" Assistant will deliver. But it’ll also let you ask follow up questions, like "which one is closest," "reserve a table for me" and then "navigate me to that restaurant," which then brings up Maps.. This is all available with the traditional voice control - via the wake phrase "OK Google" - but also within the Google Allo messaging app, which lets you have a conversation with Assistant as you find information. It’s a much slicker way of presenting and interacting with a personal assistant for two reasons: you can type questions and you can ask follow up questions. The more you interact, the more Assistant learns about your habits and tailors its answers. It’s the first step towards a genuinely useful personal assistant that isn’t a mildly amusing gimmick.. I’m late to the auto-upload game, but the day I toggled that switch, I became a convert. The fact that all Pixel owners will now get free, unlimited, Drive storage for all photos and videos - even at full resolution - is a huge boon.. I imagine this is a response to criticisms of the continued lack of expandable memory in Pixel phones, which is a clever olive-branch to the naysayers (myself being one).. The faster charging wars rumble on as Google’s latest claim is that the Pixel XL will last 7 hours on a 15 minute charge. Obviously this has to be heavily caveated with how you use your phone, but the overall message is that the phone can charge very quickly.. Questions obviously remain around the battery life of the XL. Last year’s 6P - the larger of the two devices - had unusually poor battery life, with rapid battery drain when on standby being a particular issue. Hopefully it’s not the same with the Pixel.. The new Pixel phones will be the first to use Qualcomm’s 821 chipset. There are a few improved performance numbers worth noting, including a 10% faster CPU speed over the 820, and a 5% bump in gaming performance. The latter improvement important for Google’s VR project Day Dream.. But the most eye-catching upgrade is in connectivity: thanks to support for LTE Category 12 download speeds of up 600 Mbps. The benefit of this, in a real-world scenario, is limited of course. The best LTE speeds here in the UK don’t top 80 Mbps. But it does mean that the device can handle moving data at high speed, which is important almost everywhere else on the phone. Also, the improved modem means faster overall download speeds.. SAN FRANCISCO, CA - OCTOBER 04: A journalist uses Google's Daydream VR headset during an event to introduce Google hardware products on October 4, 2016 in San Francisco, California. The improved design, best-in-class camera and unlimited "free" storage doesn’t come cheap. The most expensive model, the 128GB Pixel XL costs $819, which is right up there with the iPhone 7. Perhaps not surprising given its high-end specifications. But Nexus users will note the jump in price from previous handsets. Comparatively, last year’s most expensive Nexus, the 128GB Nexus 6P cost $649, $170 cheaper.. Jay McGregor is the editor-in-chief of a new documentary publication called Point.

The Pixel XL is the larger of two models and comes with a 5.5" QHD-screen that uses. In terms of technical camera specifications, not much has changed compared to last year's Nexus devices. A 1/2.3" 12MP sensor is paired with an F2.0 aperture but offers no optical image stabilization. However, Google has flexed its muscles on the software side of things and added a new gyroscope-based video stabilization system that reads gyro data 200 times per. second for smoother panning and shake-free handheld video recording..

Trying to replace my Lumia 950 again a year later and not seeing a camera that comes close, any suggestions? Is the Pixel 2 a lot better than the "industry leading" Pixel? The studio scene seems to say I should just find another Lumia since it tends to be my camera these days and is not matched by anything tested here...is there another good option in terms of camera?. i really want to buy this phone maybe you guys can help I searched some onlineshop to check this phone https://www.findpare.com/ https://www.lazada.com http://www.devicespecifications.com/ http://www.gsmarena.com/. to much expanding, better Xiaomi fot less money. Image quality on this phone's camera is amazing. DPreview needs to allow the comparison tool to use real cameras so we can see how these phones measure up to point and shoots.. Finally a review that tells the important basics about a camera/phone., The size of the sensor and the size of each pixel. Or did I miss something, For your information, it was said, "A camera with at least a 2.9µm pixel size is considered to be good enough.". So, we have a few years to go. I am also waiting for a lens that looks like a real lens, not like a mini lens. That is why I bought a Smartphone with a 5Mp camera, for $60, last year. I will look for a new one in 2018, maybe.. The strange initial feeling I spoke of in the first few paragraphs gradually faded as I progressed on the Pixel XL test. After a few days of use I ended up starting to look at the mobile with other eyes, and I ended up finding some attractive in that part of glass that brings the back cover.. I am sure that my initial reaction would have been much more positive if I could have tried the variant of black color or, put to ask, the blue color. Doesn't matter how good you are Google .... If you sold the 128gb model for a base price maybe. Usually you can't even buy the 128gb models but for Google perhaps.. This (Micro-SD capability) is a minor addition in terms of cost but a MAJOR advantage to one who plans to use his/her Smartphone for taking vacation pics. I just do NOT understand why Google persists in producing smartphones that do not have this feature. When Samsung tried to get cute and omit the SD card option from its 2015-2106 Galaxy 6 series, the entire series tanked. It just does not take much brainpower to figure out that a micro-SD slot is essential as sensor megapixels continue to increase and more and more people use phones as cameras.. Come, join us in the 21st Century.. ya just as fast reliable and private as a microSD card .... and cloud storage works everywhere in the entire world. And cloud storage is much much cheaper than microSD .... think about all that battery power and flash writes cycles you are conserving. There is just no downsides to it.. I've had this phone for about 6 weeks now (coming from several years of iPhone 4 to iPhone 6) and while the single pics are great, am hugely disappointed with the panoramic mode stitching errors. I love taking phone pano's and sharing; this phone has killed that for me and I am now searching for post-processing options, but that again kills my appetite for phone panos.. I recently captured about 20 mins of a family wedding on my wife's iPhone 7 Plus which had a great result and the iPhone does really well with pano -- while I like a fair bit about this phone and Android (my first time with this OS), I'm hoping a future update will fix the glaringly bad panoramic captures and give me iPhone-like results. Other still pics have been good though -- considering it's "just a phone" and not my Nikon gear.. Isn't there a better pano app in Google store you could use?. I wish I knew of one! I haven't tested any of them yet; being new to Android I don't have an insider info on each of them. Photomerge in Photoshop is okay in the meantime; for ones I don't want to share socially; but yes, another competent Android pano app would be ideal.. Find latest reviews of devices this is will help. also they have call button for querry tecgram.com. Anyone knows when it will be available on the google store for EU customers and at which price ? I haven't found any hint so far. The funny thing is that the google store hasn't in store the google phone. PIXEL XL phone by Google - 128GB-5.5"- Android Nougat - Factory Unlocked 4G/LTE Smartphone (Quite Black) £1,999.00. The same money buys a brand new D810 Nikon. Or a 55" 4K OLED LG smart TV (nice big monitor too!). The same money buys you a year living like a God in India.. Or about 20 Nokia 1020s !. @munro harrap, And just above the £1999 price you quoted you'll see the same item for £834. Still a lotof money I agree but it makes your comparison fallacious. Didn't you know that companies set a fake/stupid price as a place-holder in such sites like Amazon when they are actually out of stock?. There is no @munro harrap, and I am usually infallacious as I bought my D800 in very good condition for £750 with under 16K actuations, from a website reseller but not Amazon.. This is obviously a match for my LG G4, if its RAW files are as good, but I paid less than £300 for it brand new. It has user replaceable batteries and can take 200Gb micro SD cards and shoots reasonable 4k video and has a radio you can indeed also record from...... As a Nexus user, I'm still very disappointed with the huge price hikes involved in the Nexus to Pixel rebranding.. I'm a Nexus 5 user as well and I agree. However, I haven't see any hint of Google Pixel in terms of price or delivery date, not even on the google store (!) Did you ?. Video quality in 4K in absolutely amazing. And as usual, 1080p is bad because of undersampling (the cords of the double bass for example) For still image quality, the Nokia 808 and Nokia 1020 are still the best. more than 1000€ for a phone? Really too much.. "currently offers the best camera image quality in smartphones". Why do they always seem to exclude the Pana CM1 in those kind of statements? Only because it s got a larger sensor, it s not regarded as a smartphone?. Is it really better? I read a review somewhere and it really doesn't stand out, it may be because of bad processing optimization.. S Yu In my view it is beyond competition. I m using RAW with it, so I don t care about JPG engine, video is alright. It doesn t have stabilization and for Mobile nerds it s too bulky, this is why it s not selling. But it s half the price of today s flagship phones, and with a leica lens I m not complaining. In low light, because of lack of stabilization, I think it it s on par with current small sensor phones, cause stab gains you a few stops. In normal light it s still better than anything else phone-like IMO. My position is: it s all about the sensor first. You need clean data to process with.. The CM1 should be the benchmark for smartphones. Unfortunately it's not easy to get hold of and lacked the processing power to really keep it up to speed with current flagships. But just in terms of image quality, it is the best.. Looks over processed and unnatural, prefer the Galaxy S6 images IMHO - or iphone 7. Im just blown away by quality of that photos, its amazing. In comparison looks really brilliant in sharpness!. Just get a Nexus 5X which has the same camera hardware, it just loses the instant HDRs of the Pixel.. Another Pixel camera review that fails to make it clear what to expect in low light *handheld* using HDR+ vs top phone cameras which have OIS. Cameraphones are rarely used on tripods, so the studio comparison isn't of much use.. The tripod is the control, otherwise, this wouldn't be a valid comparison.. Sorry tripod makes the comparison invalid, except for shooting on tripod, which is rarely the case with smartphone users. A valid comparison would involve a relevant and controlled amount of camera shake as in handheld use.. What are the comments on this page all about?. The photos are blurry, pixelated and have little to like at all.. You have to download the full size images to see the details. The most disappointing one was the iso1600 image of the train. My small compact can manage much better.. I'm getting to this review late, but I have to say I'm very impressed. I prefer the Apple interface but if I were a Droid user this would be my choice hands down. Most impressive to me is the IQ at higher ISOs. On my 7 Plus when I force up the ISOs I get that mottled batik look when pixel peeping. That dynamic doesn't show at all on the Pixel, and the noise from the Pixel's high ISOs presents itself as a very pleasing super-fine grain. Apple tends to do what it wants without regards to the competition other than offering large screen Plus models, so I can't expect them to answer this with comparable improvements. But I hope they use this to spur at least some higher level of IQ for their future offerings.. apple continues to offer the poorest smallest sensor cameras..... some of the worst music digital music processing, lousy headphones, and really poor value for money, their phones are prone to screen cracking more than any maker... its a testiment to marketing and crowd behavoir dynamics and mass stupidity that they lead the market in sales. I disagree on the Apple phone-cameras. I have an iPhone 6-plus that has produced some fine photos. I'm not an accomplished user, but I am a decent photographer (with Nikon and Fujifilm gear) and my photo buddies and I know that the best camera is the one you have with you. In the case of the iPhone 6+, that's all the time. I don't claim to get iPhone photos that are as good or sophisticated as I get with Nikon or Fuji, but I have gotten good quality images that I'm happy to send around to colleagues.. To all the people who can not figure out why Google did not offer a microSD slot, here is the answer: They would not be able to charge $200 more for the extra internal memory in the phone. That will make them a LOT of money! It seems like a pretty straightforward business decision to me.. People who can afford this phone, can and WILL get the 128GB vs the 32GB version if they really need it. It is a very nice phone with a GREAT camera, and that Google assistant feature will make it my next phone. I want a smaller 5 inch screen, so this phone seems perfect for me, with the 32GB memory ;). Lack of MicroSD is the reason why I won't be buying Google XL despite of a great camera. This single lack is driving me toward Samsung S7. 32GB is plenty of memory for most users. Samsung has nice hardware but their phones come loaded with every kind of crap software, junkware, and bloatware in existence which cannot be uninstalled. For that reason alone I have the Google Pixel which only comes with the basic android operating system, no junkware. Samsung can take a flying leap with their software bullsh*t.. I do not agree - my S5 neo is great smartfon. Works as navigation, videorecoreder during car driving, gives information about engine parameters (temperatures, voltage, pressures and more) also works as a camera when I do not need Dx sensor and playing chess. Th eonly remark I have is it doesnt make a coffee. But this unit works fast and without any problems internet lte is fast, video/audio players without isses and what is important is waterproofed, I can change the battery and SD card (I use 128 GB) and for me 32 GB is not enough - for navigation I have all Europe maps on the SD and a lot of music and movies too. I am glad GPS works fine (in former Galaxy S2 GPS was terrible) The best thing is I paid ca 170$ for this smartphone and I do not understand why people pay 4 times more for units where there is no battery or SD changing possibility. Android I use is 5.x Lolipop with TW. System is 100% stable since the begening.. "software bullsh*t", wow, Dpreview lets comments like this out but censors a legit discussion, lmao.. The Samsung S7 is a top smartphone, bought by millions, has been out for 10 months and nearly due for an upgrade, but is for some reason not reviewed by DPReview?. It has a more consistent performance across all areas, unlike this Pixel, based on various tests, including DXOMark, which rated its camera at 88 compared to the Pixel's 89 ! The Pixel was found slightly better mainly in its HDR and colour saturation, but weaker in AF, video, flare control and camera features like stitching and camera operational control.. In other non-camera areas, S7 is clearly ahead, e.g. MicroSD card, better weather sealing, display resolution, wireless charging, abundance of accessories, support, price, .... Can we expect a review before the S8 is announced? Thanks Lars.. I much prefer the pure android Google setup. wireless charging would be nice though.. I found the card essential to keep all my video, photos, music, and personal data handy wherever I am. 4K video means the smaller memory models of these phones fill up very quickly and lots of frequent backup work. To get the same 128GB ($50 for Extreme Plus recently), you will need to spend about $500 extra buying a top Pixel, but still can't transfer all that contents easily or efficiently to others.. As for bloatware, you have a point. They are however many people who use them, eg heart rate, or who have got used to Samsung GUI, or features like Payment, as they have become a sort of standard now, in addition to Apple's, due to the popularity of those 2 brands.. Maybe it is but I do not see much practical advantages over my5times cheaper S5 Neo. The only smartphone I would change S5 Neo is Note 4 - there is still battery and SD card changing possible and note 4 is larger what is big pros for me because I use smartphne in the car as a navi.. I use an S7 and it has become an essential in my camera bag alongside my Sony gear. That being said, I also need a microSD slot because I shoot in RAW with my S7. 32GB isn't a whole lot of space.. I am confused, I was labouring under the assumption that all smart phones had microscopic sensors. This article reference a 1/2.3 sensor (6.17 x 4.55 mm) making it the same size as a point and shoot camera.. If this is true then there would appear to be some optical magic to get such a small lens to sensor distance and small lens diameters. If they are same size sensor I would like to see a direct comparison between cell phones and point and shoot camera images.. And just as a point of curiosity what is the mechanical mechanism that allows movement between the sensor and lens to set focus.. have you been hiding under a rock? :-) jokes aside, this is not something new and already being used since several years. Of course big sensors are a huge advantage, but technology in smartphone is amazing if you think about the quality you can get for this mechanical setup compared to a standalone camera which can have so much more space and lenses.. Your last question is a good one. I don't know, but perhaps it is electromagnetic or piezoelectric?. there are quite a few smartphones with this size sensor. As long as the lens is a wide-angle there is not much of a problem space-wise...things get much more tricky with optical zoom which is why smartphones tend to come with prime lenses.. Should not DPreview be offering a value for money comparison? Given the high UK prices for this and competitor phones a more relevant to the consumer price and feature analysis would have been helpful. I am definitely not a phone watcher but surely the UK prices shown here are so absolutely crazy they must be in Apple territory? Why exactly is it 5x the price of a full featured phone like the Moto G? Is it full of military spec components and covered in 24ct gold?. It's a Project Fi compliant phone, that where its value is.. For a camera-focused review I cannot understand how this information can be left out in the key specifications.. hardly any smartphone manufacturers specify this...partly because it tends to be around the same on all of them, 27 or 28mm equivalent.... It's 4.67mm, which at 1/2.3" sensor gives 29mm in 35mm terms.. @ Lars Rehm: I just can say that I personally want to know what focal length a camera has. It is one of the very basics of shooting pictures.. The less a spec is easily available from the manufacturer´s specsheets, the more valuable it would be to have that spec in a review. The more camera-based the review is, the higher are my expectations to find it. If my local newspaper prints a smartphone review I can forgive them for not investigating to find focal length information. However, at Dpreview, one of the highest rated photography sites, missing out focal length as part of the key specifications is a no-go to me.. I really appreciate the work that you and the DPR team put into the test of the smartphone cameras. I just wish that some of the time would also be spent to find the complete set of specs.. And I do not agree with the statement “…all tend to be around 27…28mm”. Compare Sony Xperia Z5 (24mm) to Samsung Galaxy S5 (31mm). Don´t say this makes no difference in shooting.. It's possibly a matter of language but I don"t understand what is ment by "Unfortunately there is still no "tap to capture" option, though." Anybody? Pls.. copy paste from pokémon go review. on some phones you can set the camera to capture an image when you tap on the screen to focus. On the Pixel you have to tap to focus first and then tap on the virtual shutter button to capture.. Lars, are you sure? I don't have this phone. But on my moto G4, with stock android camera, I can pull options from the left hand side and on the shutter type option, I can choose shutter button or tap any where. This focuses and shoots in one.. "DPReview smartphone reviews are written with the needs of photographers in mind". do those photographers know what focal length is?. The reviewer is out of their freakin' mind. The Pixel XL's image quality is clearly leagues ahead of the competition thanks to its image stacking HDR. The comparison tool shows the results: Pixel at 1150 ISO has more detail than Lumia 950 does at 320 ISO. I don't think your reviewer fully appreciates how much image stacking improves image quality. This camera deserves 90%+ and a gold mark.. Perhaps you should take up reviewing then!. > The reviewer is out of their freakin' mind.. That's a bit too harsh, isn't it?.. I do agree with you though that the reviewer completely missed the whole point of HDR Auto -- and that is exactly how the phone is going to be used most of the time. By most photographers (myself included), anyway.. Do you go to Madrid to test smartphones? Nothing to complain, since I'm from there.. yes, I spend a lot of time here which is why many of the smartphone reviews have images from Madrid in them :). Madrid has a very good light, and at the same a very difficult one (because of high contrast), so I think it's a very good place to test cameras and sensors. And, in general, your pics, Lars, are very informative of the device, thanks a lot.. For the test, you can try something different like: El Rastro, Lavapies, Plaza Santa Ana, or even Calle Ave Maria where my mom still living. That is the other Madrid, with its gipsies, African emigrants and Indian restaurants,. It's unbelievable that the lack of memory expansion is not listed as a Con!. The phone is a PDA, PERSONAL Digital Assistant. So instant access to mountable storage is very important to countless people for easy backup, private sharing, transfers between devices. The Cloud is a poor alternative.. In fact I'm ready for dual card slots.. I had a microSD card die on me a while back. Thank the cloud for saving everything. Dual slots would be good too, but with the cloud I can access images and video quickly from my notebook.. @Fun 4 all: I have had Ssds and Hdds fail on me that doesnt mean I will dump all my data/programs/OS onto cloud. Cloud storage is not the answer to every problem rather it comes with its own unique set of headaches. Having microsd card slot is convinient also it doesnt increase the size of device to unreasonable level. Its just dumb design choice to exclude that slot.. lack of expandable memory is inexcusable in a phone that purports to include a camera. "lack of expandable memory is inexcusable in a phone that purports to include a camera". The phone does something most cameras don't. It backs up the photo before the SD can fail or get damaged or get lost. And in the past year I've had TWO SD cards go bad. There is a great reason why "Pro" cameras have two card slots and why it is smart to back up photos before the cards fail. This camera backups up UNLIMITED original size images and video. So on vacation one could take 200 GB of 4K video and stills and never worry about deleting or swapping cards. Free Wi-fi does all the work. backing up on a phone is always a good option. but the ability to remove media at 256 gb a throw is better than tethering or laboring at it wirelessly. i too have had sd cards go south ,,,, but that not a sufficient reason to exclude the option for the user,,,, internet connections are not always available and the ability to offload huge amounts of raw data to a laptop via a card swap is an option i think should not be lost. assuming a 10 tbase connection at 10 megabites a sec that 200 gb will take 48hours :53min : at 1 mbps its 477 hours:25min and :50 sec. i can swap a card in less than 30 sec. Thanks for the review, but I'm a bit confused by what you mean when you say HDR. The phone has 3 options, HDR + OFF, HDR + Auto and HDR + ON. HDR + ON is not just forcing HDR + Auto to activate, it's a different algorithm (it takes in fact a few seconds to take a picture in HDR + ON vs almost instant in HDR + Auto) So I guess when you show pictures with the title HDR + ON, you do mean that mode? And in the low light picture of the locomotive, I suppose it was in HDR + Auto ?. Last point, do you have any thoughts on those two options, does one gives better results than the other? Or should we stay in auto all the time?. HDR+ Auto is NOT an automatic switch for turning HDR+ On or Off. If the reviewer(s) did any of their homework, they'd realize that HDR+ Auto operates very differently from HDR+ On and produces very different results depending on the situation... HDR+ Auto begins snapping photos as soon as you open the camera app, and STOPS when you hit the shutter button. It uses the previous 8 or so shots, stacks them, and creates an HDR image. This is how Google has eliminated the lag of using this mode. HDR+ On is not continuously taking photos. It STARTS taking photos when you hit the shutter button, and operates slowly like the HDR+ on previous Google phones. It produces a better result in plenty of every day usage scenarios, and is absolutely worth mentioning and testing.. HDR+ Auto and HDR+ On each have a purpose, yet this was COMPLETELY MISSED and INACCURATELY discussed in this review.. Yes, I have seen some examples where HDR+ ON delivered better results than HDR+ Auto, esecially considering dynamic range.. Now only are these tiny sensors getting better, but the processing and software is improving. HDR, Lens Blur, image stitching, are all 'gimmicks' that keep improving at a much faster rate than ILCs. Smartphones have had 4K video and 120 FPS video for a while, but only now are some ILCs adding these features. The only place smartphones can't compete is longer focal lengths.. I've had this phone for a while and love it by the way.. Smartphones have all of these fast-improving features because they have very high-end CPUs and a ton of RAM for processing.. I wonder if we'll see camera manufacturers drop their current design paradigm at some point soon (in-house processors, bare minimum computing specs), and start designing cameras the same way... Snapdragon processor, 6GB of RAM, high capacity built in battery, etc.... I don't get why a built in battery is an issue. Lack of microSD slot is though. There are all kinds of cases that act as 2nd/extra batteries increasing time between charges.. Fun 4 all, this was in response to built in batteries for possible future cameras.. I also hate built-in batteries on smartphones, which is why LG is my favorite.. Built in batteries are a big deal for people like me. I have a Note 5 that I've had for nearly 2 years, battery life was great when I first got it, but now by 12PM the battery is down to 50% even if I've barely used it. I've done a factory reset, deleted unnecessary apps and notifications, hasn't helped - my phone needs a new battery. My next phone will be a LG V20.. Built in battery and no microSD are not going anywhere anytime soon. No microSD allows manufacturers to charge a big storage premium (and push people into their cloud architecture). And built in batteries force more frequent camera turnover. A conspiracist might even wonder if OS upgrades might include intentional reductions in battery life to force users to upgrade.. Hey, I hate the idea of a built-in battery as much as the next person... but I think it's only a matter of time before camera manufacturers basically start copying everything mobile phone companies do.. Really "force" that upgrade every 2 years.. Would be a lot harder for camera manufacturers because cameras are used by pros for extended shoots. Built in batteries would be a non-starter.. DPReveiw readers: this is what's killing the regular camera market. This continual improvement of the "low end" media market is showing no signs of slowing down. No wonder the movement to bigger sensors. DPReview: Is it time to do reviews comparing these phone cameras with low-end regular cameras? I think this type of comparative review would help your readers and those who become disappointed with their phones.. The average person couldn't care less. It's going no further THAN their, or someone else's phone. As long is it looks good on their phone, they are happy.. I don't say this in support of them. I'm a pro and have to put up with people taking the same shot I am at an event. Or I do a group shot then someone hands me their phone. Even if they are getting my shots for free. when images are only viewed on 5 inch screens what point is having quality matter ?. its a continual shame that promising hardware developments r hampered by corporate policy by both google & apple, theres a rift developing in apples religious community & google coulda had a coup in reform policies by including whats denied to the apple faithful.namely removable SD. the desire to mold user behavior & push a cloud agenda is what links the 2 giants & poisons their products its now 2016, 256gb micro sd cards are widely available, 200 gb , the sweet spot pricewise are inexpensive. apples&googles contention having a peak 256gb capacity. at eye watering msrp..without ability to remove physically a quarter terabyte is simply nonsense ,& a slap in the face of every user forced to offload data wirelessly or tethered, a chore sensible camera phone buyers should avoid like plague. the pixel uses a real camera sensor, a p&s type apple has yet to use , it it why this crippled phone leaps ahead in iq, sadly 3rd party apps are necessary for manual .thats google for ya.. Google wants to squeeze every last drop out the consumer making them pay more for larger internal storage.. You'd think they would have learned from the mistakes of others.. not really, Google is all about the cloud, they want you to save your data on Drive and Google Photos instead of internal memory...I think it's great because it gives you access to your stuff from anywhere and any device but if that's not your kind of thing the Pixel probably is not for you.. @Lars...only where you have service, or a data plan. It is not about the cloud at all. It is about selling phones with more storage at inflated prices; don't fall into the "Google trap" of saying the cloud will set you free so you don't need additional easy to add features. The cloud is just a straw man. But then again, if I'm going somewhere where I will be taking lots of pics, I will bring the so-called "real" camera.. The Cloud is a better backup. I would not want to have 128 gigs of storage available to me and then leave the phone on a bus and lose a ton of photos from the last 18 months .. There's no hope for you if you don't have a backup during that 18 months time frame (LOL). I'll always take the external storage over the cloud, especially when I'm in Africa or other place with no service. Even with the cloud, there is no real excuse no to have external storage these days...none. And what did you do when there was no cloud?. @Lars Rehm "...I think it's great because it gives you access to your stuff from anywhere and any device .." Sure, that may come in handy for many ppl, but the truth is, google just wants your Data, and that's the big selling point...personal ads, your very own data, and very soon your (medical) data also...into a not too far away scenerio, google does know everything about you...and that's not a good point, in any way...and so is with everybody else.. @Lars I'm a tad on the fence with cloud based storage. to me, the fact that the mother load of my data would be essentially "owned" to a degree by a company that makes its major money from targeted advertisements would be bothersome. at the same time using cloud storage (from say, a respected third party service) does not compete with having user upgradeable memory. To me fixed memory without expansion has only two purposes: limiting the device' life-span and pushing the buyer towards the more expensive model. its one of the reasons why I stick with my Samsung... I CAN use the Cloud (and I do for backup), but I can also expand / change storage.... I would not opt for anything else.... "I think it's great because it gives you access to your stuff from anywhere". With respect Lars that's naive at best. Many years ago I worked for a Bay Area HQ manufacturer of broadcast equipment. Their design team were waxing lyrically about how their latest product could be fixed remotely Worldwide over a modem. When I pointed out that some of the TV stations I visited in Africa had, at that time, no reliable phone line they were incredulous. Just one of the many cases I know of design engineers, particularly Bay Area ones, living in an ivory cloud (no pun intended) with little understanding of the real world. Cloud storage isn't even practical in parts of the US let alone "anywhere". Like others here, it does seem to me to be more of a marketing decision not to have any SD card storage capability.. dmartin92 It's right there in the Bible: "Thou shall NOT set down thy cell phone! Thou shall have in thy hand or thy pocket. The same goeth for thy wallet and thy keys. I've been waiting to upgrade my old Nexus 5 to a Pixel XL and this review only makes me more impatient. I really hope Google will start selling them worldwide soon... IMHO this is another one-and-done experiment like the Motorola. I will bet you $1 that the new flagship Nokia phone will put this phone to shame from a camera standpoint, hardware and software. Plus with Samsung sort of in a "nothing-new" purgatory, until their S8/N8 reflect a delivery date, Pixel is the only 'new' phone out there now.. There won't ever be a Nokia flagship phone again. There will be some phones under the Nokia brand of course, but cheap and for emerging markets. Look at the upcoming Nokia C1 Here the link to its specs http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_c1-6885.php. Snapdragon 652 cpu and Adreno 510 gpu does not sound even remotely like flagship. And rumoured does not sound like upcoming, either.. Which Motorola was one and done?. Having had the Nexus 4 and currently Nexus 5, I'd been waiting eagerly for this to launch. The pricing is impossible to justify however, at up to £819 for the 128GB XL.. I'm now faced with a difficult decision: 1. Buy a OnePlus 3T and make do with a camera which is a step down from my Nexus 5. Sobering that the 3T and a Ricoh GR is a similar price to the XL.. Buy a Galaxy S7, which has an excellent camera, is more weatherproof than the Pixel, and has impressive build quality. However using TouchWiz is annoying and I want lighter, cleaner stock android, plus ideally 64GB or more on board storage. It also has OIS which is welcome.. If I was pushed I'd get the 3T, but for now I need to wait for either the price gouging to calm down or for someone like OnePlus to use a better camera module.. Isn't the S7 just as expensive as the standard Pixel?. And as for storage, I find 32gb to be plenty since you can offload full resolution files to google photos for free.. The regular Pixel starts at about $650, the S7 at around $500, so the former is about 30% more.. Google keep missing the boat with their smartphones. My NEXUS 5 burned up batteries due to overheating. But I finally learned how to control it. (funny thing, I also own a Sony NEX 5.) I would give the Pixel a pass.. I went from a Nexus 4 to Nexus 5. Was hoping for a reasonably priced Pixel. So I got a Nexus 6P from Best Buy for nothing (actually came out ahead by $40...long story there). Never an issue with the Nexus line for me. I'm always ok to be one generation behind and getting those phones just after the new ones come out. Never have to add anything to a contract or pay cash up front....haven't for years and years. The 6P's screen is amazing and, from my perspective, blows away the smaller Pixel screen. The larger one, well, that is another issue.. If your problem with the S7 is the launcher I really recommend using the Google now Launcher then.. I own a 6p and as you mentioned the 6p is a darn great phone: great screen, great camera (with raw), great speakers, poor battery life... I'm typing this on a nice Samsung Tab S2 and for all practical purposes the OS feels just like my phone, a Nexus 5. Both have 6.01 and both use the excellent Nova launcher (I don't like the Google launcher either).. Don't be put off by the default Samsung (or Google) stuff, Android is really easy to adapt to your own personal preferences.. @Rhawi What is wrong with the battery life? I have not had it that long. Seems ok and certainly a step up from the Nexus 5. Let me know what to look for.. @newe My usage mainly consists of some browsing/video watching in the morning, then followed by letting it plugged charging during work day, spotify after work (at the gym) and some more browsing/video watching coming home. When I arrive home I might have 30% left.. I am not sure what it is actually. It just annoyed me enough that I got a power bank. I still love the phone and can't see changing to any device currently in the market but, as with cameras, there is no one perfect one. @nebulight - I have seen the S7 for as little as £439. If the Pixel was £160 cheaper across each configuration, it would be much easier to justify. As yet I haven't seen anyone discounting the Pixel though. For storage I was considering adding a fast microSD card and using it as Adaptable Storage. I worry that this will fail, but in my experience of the Galaxy S2, S5 and Moto G2, Android plays so much nicer when it see only one storage volume.. @Rhawi Dantas - Part of me wishes that I'd gone for the 64GB 6P while the end of line sale was on at the Google Store, but also now I figure that spending £400+ means I'd quite like a minimum of 4GB RAM. I will have a look at the Google Now launcher though, I hadn't realised that non Google devices could see that in the store.. @John Bean (UK) - I ended up using an AOSP ROM on my Galaxy S2, and it ran so much faster. I can freeze out the apps I don't want to see but it's frustrating to know there is more performance and battery life under there. That said, I've used a friend's S7 and it's certainly fast, plus I can get the Mophie power case for super long battery life.. Why not getting a used one in eBay? Flash CyanogenMod and you good to go. Can you use all the features, esp the HDR+ mode that is highly touted in the review, while shooting using a third party RAW app?. You can't use HDR+ for RAW as it's multiple exposures and it's done in app through the Stock Photos app. Unless a third party dev makes their own version, or google opens up their software, then no you can't.. I guess I should be asking if the images underlying the HDR+ mode can be saved in RAW. But then I guess you'd have to manually do the HDR. Might be too much trouble for casual cell photos.. That puts you in a bit of a tough spot, RAW capture or in camera HDR+ jpegs but you can't do both.. I recommend using HDR+ instead of Raw. The HDR+ results are often better than what you can achieve with a raw file. In low light with a tripod I would use raw sometimes and when I want to take a portrait. I would also recommend using a third party camera app occasionally for macro.. I most of the time use RAW with my Lumia 1020. That's because of compensating over or under exposure. I carefully studied in Photoshop CC the images supplied here with this review. I am amazed about the IQ and the absense of noise. In PS it's perfectly possible to enlarged quite a lot and after applying Slim Sharpening arrive at an enormous large picture also with good IQ. I am quite familiar with the wonders that image stacking can do in Photoshop. Noise reduction, super-sharpening and improved dynamic range. It's clever Google implemented all this in their Pixel smartphone. Now only the price must go down a bit and then I abandon my Lumia 1020. The Lumia 1020 is not copatible with Windows 10 and only takes version 8.1. Well, for a supposed photo site, it's interesting that RAW quality images wasn't mentioned in real way. As we all know, the JPEG engine is better, or worse, in different cameras. But it can have little to do with the RAW quality of the image. As can be seen in the tests, moving to RAW shows that the iPhone 7+ camera is quite a bit better, even if the Pixel jpegs are somewhat better. In reviews in Anandtech, the problems with Android cameras, in general, and particularly with video, are noted. That stuttering is considered to be a major problem in Android Phone videos. For some reason, whether it's based in the OS or not, all Android phones have problems with video, though Lars seems to have low standards for that (among other things).. There are other things in these reviews that are lacking.. I'll have to continue this in the reply to my own post because of character Number limitations here.. There are other things in these reviews that are lacking. For example, it would be considered to be shocking if most all cameras didn't have Adobe RGB available for jpegs. Yet, the DCI-P3 color gamut, which is noticeably wider that Adobe RGB, and much wider than sRGB, isn't mentioned at all. While it's true that most monitors are still sRGB, and uncalibrated at that, Adobe RGB is still considered to be important for editing, which I can emphasize from my own career in this business. So DCI-P3, should be noted as well, or the lack of it. I never see it mentioned either way, except for a quick statement. It needs to be evaluated, and compared to other phones, such as the Pixel.. Google looks well ahead on JPEG processing. Looking at the low-light comparison at print size, the iPhone is very competitive based on RAW data. Slightly less saturated, but details look similar.. "iPhone is very competitive based on RAW data. Slightly less saturated, but details look similar.". The lenses (both the wide and the tele) on the iPhone 7 are MUCH softer. It's like the difference between a cheap zoom and a sharp prime. For jpegs, the heavy NR that Apple applies, adds insult to injury,. The images are actually sharper on the iPhone. I don't know why the jpeg is different in the edges and corners.. "currently offers the best image quality of all smartphone cameras" - can't agree on that. I have seen much better images even from older iPhones, Lumias and Samsung phones. It seems to have better high ISO performance than other mobile cameras, but that is about it.. Can you tell us which iPhones are better...or which Samsungs?. The iPhone 7+ does have better quality, particularly when RAW images are considered, which in a photo site, is a necessity. But the reviews of smartphone cameras gloss over it. You can make the comparisons in the charts though, by selecting RAW instead of jpeg. Then you will see the differences.. This bothers me, because no real camera review would just rely on jpeg image quality when judging to image quality.. Looking at the jpg and raws from both cameras on the dropdown, I'm going to go ahead and say...nope.. My iPhone 7 has a very nice camera, I use RAM on the Lightroom app and works pretty well.. I only looked at the images in the gallery and didn't see anything special except for good high ISO performance and quite unpleasant colors. In the Studio Scene it has a little more detail than the iPhone 7+, but at the expense of more noise (raw / high ISO).. The RAW files from the iPhone 7 are relatively soft (both lenses) and have more noise for the same physical exposure, for using a smaller sensor (especially the one in the tele module). So no, the iPhone does not have better RAW performance, au contraire.. Putting the iPhone 7 and the Pixel in the comparison tool, the iPhone 7 is literally blurry in comparison. There is no fine detail preserved whatsoever. It's even worse if you use the "telephoto" lens which isn't even telephoto at 56mm.. Apple dropped the ball big time on their cameras this year. Not to mention they are still using image sensors significantly smaller than everyone else (pastel effect from NR is visible as low as ISO 80), along with a poor HDR implementation and weaker video stabilization. Quality is so poor from the telephoto camera as well that at higher ISO's the camera actually just uses a crop from the "wide" camera instead.. Not a big difference in my opinion. And generally colors are much better from the iPhone if you check the galleries.. The only phone with a better camera is probably CM1 with it's 1in sensor, but the phone part of that device is slowly get dated. Not clear if Panasonic will bring out a CM2(I hope they do).. Why is not a single daylight lens-flare sample in the gallery although is is the camera´s biggest flaw?!. there are a couple on the IQ page, not a major issue imo though. Wow, lots of hating, I didn't expect that.. It's positive comments about a camera phone on a website visited by people who pay thousands of dollars to take pretty pictures. I would readjust your expectations, sir. I get the appeal of camera phones. These devices have the screen resolution and computing power of many laptops, all in a miniature format, that's never gonna be cheap...and they have pretty good cameras as well.... Wearing varifocals I don't do miniature. I guess that anything will do............. A Snapdragon processor does not have the compute power of a laptop processor. They are great for what they are designed for (phones with no active cooling and less than 1/4" thick).. Who would give away ALL their mobile acvtivity to a company like Google??? People wake up!. well, you have to give it either to Google or Apple these days...not much choice.... No, you don't give much to Apple, and what you do, you need to opt into, and can easily opt out of. Not so with Google, which collects far more data, and makes it impossible to refuse.. Indeed, it is a bit of a Hobson's choice.. FWIW—and this is just hearsay—my friends in the tech industry (who have worked for these companies) tend to trust Google more than Apple with their data.. Also, having reviewed the photos (which showcase how good it is as a smartphone FYI) the noise control isnt as good as the samsung (but is fine grained an very impressive) whilst the majority of photos look flat/ dull.. I am not sure how they can say its class leading high iso without having compared to the best i have used (and compared) which is the S7 Edge. That is stunning with I believe the fastest AF in the business. Not sure why DPReview never reviewed the S7?. that one is easy to answer: because Samsung has not been capable of getting me a review unit...I really hope they do get their act together when the S8 comes out. That said, I have used the device on numerous occasions and we also have it in our IQ comparison tool.. "Samsung has not been capable of getting me a review unit.". A site as big as dpreview should not be relying on manufacturers for review units for products that have already launched. ensure they're getting a normal unit and not one that is hand picked and pre-tested. avoid conflicts of interest - if a site gives a bad review then they might not get free samples in the future 3. not cost that much - you could give the test units away as promotions or sell them on ebay when they're done. As a reputable seller of units used for 1 day or week maybe you'd take a 20% hit off the retail price, but that's a small price to pay for journalistic integrity.. Total: 60, showing: 1 – 50.

The Google Pixel isn't Google's first phone released by the company, but it is the first phone designed, built, and released by the company.. Whereas the Nexus line leveraged reference designs from various Android partners, the Pixel is apologetically Google's device from start to finish.. In some ways, it feels as if Google is finally getting serious about pushing Android into the future by using hardware and software improvements instead of leaving it to its partners to figure out what the future holds for the OS.. Google's Pixel XL next to Apple's iPhone 7 Plus.. Let's get this out of the way right now: the Pixel looks like an iPhone. Its soft rounded corners, double-chin borders above and below the display, and antenna lines share similarities with Apple's newest iPhone -- and it's brilliant.. What's more appealing to the iPhone faithful who are perhaps betting bored? An Android device that's unfamiliar? Or an Android device that invokes feelings of familiarity?. For most, the idea of switching between two platforms -- iOS and Android in this instance -- is an intimidating experience. Having to relearn how to carry out commons tasks and discovering apps a user relies on daily is more than enough to scare someone away from making the jump to another platform.. By replicating the overall look and feel of the iPhone, Google is making the move slightly easier on the user.. I'd be lying if I didn't admit on a few occasions over the past 10 days I felt as if I was using an iPhone running Android when testing the Pixel XL.. Google Pixel XL's back is half metal, half glass. It's different, but not as ugly as I expected it to be.. Verizon's advertising campaign would like to make you think the Pixel is only available in the US from the carrier, but the truth is, you can purchase the Pixel directly from Google or at Best Buy. All Pixel phones are unlocked and will work on all major US carriers.. Google sent me a Pixel XL with a Verizon Wireless SIM card, and I was able to switch between Verizon and my personal AT&T SIM card without any issue.. The first time I rebooted the Pixel XL with a Verizon SIM card, I found three Verizon-branded apps installed on the device without my permission. Thankfully, I was able to uninstall the apps, and they have yet to show back up, even as I've switched between SIM cards.. Android 7.0 Nougat added the ability to quickly switch between two apps by double-tapping on the app switcher button. On the Nexus 6P, there's almost always a bit of lag when switching between apps. On the Pixel XL, the switch is nearly instantaneous.. The speed at which the Pixel switches between apps is a prime example of the speed found throughout the experience. It's responsive to touches, opening apps with ease, and is free of any dramatic slowdowns.. That annoying stutter that's always present when scrolling through your Facebook News Feed? Yeah, that's gone too.. Battery life is something I didn't expect to have good things to say about on the Pixel. Sure, there are a few exceptions, but for the most part, battery life isn't great on Android phones.. However, the battery life on the Pixel XL has been impressive. Not only does it last me through a full workday of email, tweeting, taking photos, a few phone calls, some music streaming, but I would often end the day with between 30 to 40 percent of battery left.. The only other device I've been able to consistently hit that same mark on is the iPhone 7 Plus.. 1 - 5 of 7. Google's Nexus line was never known for its photo quality. Each year, Google would tout camera improvements and promise the company had finally figured it out, only to disappoint users.. True to form, Google repeated the same promises for the Pixel's camera and gleefully proclaimed DxO Mark, a company known for testing and grading camera performance, ranked the Pixel as the best smartphone camera ever ; beating the iPhone 7 Plus and Galaxy S7 Edge.. For the first time, Google was right. The Pixel camera is really good. There's zero shutter lag (another feature the company gloated about), and it's fast to focus. For me, that means capturing photos of my kids who never sit still is possible.. Photos are a tiny bit oversaturated, which can sometimes give a fake look to the picture, but more often than not, the photos I captured with my review unit looked really good.. I would feel confident carrying either an iPhone 7 Plus or a Google Pixel as my lone camera on a family vacation. That's a statement that not only shows just how far smartphone cameras have come, but also how good the Pixel camera is.. As for video, Google added video stabilization to the Pixel. Meaning, when users record video with the Pixel and naturally shake or bounce while walking, the Pixel will minimize the transfer of that motion into the end video.. While video stabilization works on the Pixel, there's a horrible stutter if you turn the phone to adjust the recording angle. Videos recorded with very little movement from side to side look amazing, but I find watching a video with a lot of side to side movement more distracting than impressive.. The Google Pixel ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. The first, and currently only, device to have the latest version of Android.. The Pixel is the first device to ship with Android 7.1 Nougat. In addition to the new features in Android's latest OS, such as app shortcuts and a GIF keyboard, the Pixel has a few exclusive features.. For starters, Google is giving all Pixel users unlimited Google Photos storage when backing up photos and videos taken with the Pixel. Google currently offers unlimited storage from other devices including the iPhone, but only if you allow Google to store a lower quality version of the photo or video.. With the Pixel, Google is backing up photos and videos at full resolution, including 4K, for free.. Google has also launched a 24/7 support service built directly into the Pixel's Settings menu with the new phone. At any time you can open the Settings app, tap on Support and begin a chat conversation or a phone call with a Google support representative.. You can ask for device help on completing a task (changing your ringtone, for example) or receive more thorough troubleshooting help should you need it.. Google Assistant is another exclusive feature of the Pixel. You can activate the personal assistant with a long-press on the home button, or a wake command of "OK Google" activates the personal assistant.. The 10 best smartphones of 2017. Apple and Google recently announced new 2017 phones, but even these phones can't surpass Samsung's latest Galaxy Note 8.. Similar to Siri, you can query Google Assistant for common web searches, sports scores, weather forecasts, send messages, and create reminders.. As I mentioned in my initial hands-on with the Pixel XL, Google Assistant continues to surprise me on a daily basis. Just yesterday, I was talking about a family member who recently underwent cataract surgery. Unsure of the exact surgical process, I asked Google Assistant "What do you know about cataract surgery?". In response, Google Assistant read the opening sentence from a webpage detailing the gist of the procedure without hesitation. I could then tap on my screen to open the corresponding website if I wanted to know more.. I repeated the same search on my iPhone 7 Plus with Siri. Siri's first response was a playful "Who, me?". The second attempt returned a link to a Wikipedia page, with Siri asking if I wanted her to read it aloud.. In the end, I achieved the same results, but with Google Assistant providing them faster and with less interaction on my part.. At one point, I asked Assistant for the date and time of the third presidential debate. After hearing the result, I told Google Assistant "Add it to my calendar." Instead of keeping the context of my query front and center, Assistant began asking me for a name of the event, followed by the date and time.. A lone "G" on the back of the Pixel lets you know it's made by Google.. Simply put: the Google Pixel is the best Android phone on the market. It's fast and has an amazing camera, as well as a battery that lasts all day and then some, and it features the latest Android software improvements.. Samsung's Note 7 recall came at the best possible time for Google, which will surely benefit from Samsung's battery woes.. For some, the iPhone-like design, lack of water resistance, and expensive price tag are going to be enough to shun the Pixel. I can't blame you if you fall into that camp.. Now that Samsung and Apple are shipping $700 phones with water resistance, all device makers need to follow suit. In the same way fingerprint sensors are found on devices priced high and low, some sort of water resistance needs to be included.. Still, Google has created one of my favorite Android devices ever. (A label previously held by the now-defunct Note 7.). Android users who are looking for a new phone, look no further than the Pixel lineup. For those iPhone users tempted by the dark side, the Pixel is as good a place to start as any.. CAT S41 - 4G LTE - 32 GB - GSM - smartphone. Kick off your day with ZDNet's daily email newsletter.

Capture every special occasion using this Google Pixel XL.. by dcw20641 Jun 27, 2017. Great Phone, very very fast, not great GPS. Everything about this phone is fantastic. First android I've had in a long time that easily lasts through the day. 32 gb is a little small, I wish I'd gotten the larger phone as there is no sd card expansion options. The unlimited photo/video storage is fantastic though. The GPS has had trouble tracking me at times, but Google sent me a replacement phone and the new one seems to work.. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned. by raingram1951 Dec 02, 2017. Probably the best camera of all the phones. Google Assistant is really getting good. Excellent customer support with 24/7 support contact built into the phone. Unlimited photo storage and automatic backup to Google drive.. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned. by anthonylecom Nov 11, 2016. Unlimited Cloud Storage for uncompressed pictures and videos @ 4K Recording!!! Keep all of your memories stored forever and never worry about losing them. Camera is rated #1 for Smartphone beating out s7 edge and iPhone 7 plus. Fingerprint reader works well and quick. New Android assistant is more conversational, one step closer to AI. It's a bit pricey but worth every penny. I am a power user and would typically need to charge at least 1-2 times a day. I could easily get away with only charging every night. by dmw1202 Apr 06, 2017. Love this phone! I love stock Android, great size, great screen resolution, battery gets me through an entire day. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned. by rys_aqu_ufkjalk Jun 27, 2017. The phone came with about 3 butterfly scratches. By that I mean you dont notice them unless you really wanted to, and you would have to hold it up to a light with the screen off.. As for the phone itself, I feel like its Googles version of the iPhone. Things are unique to the phone itself, not just another android phone. The camera is great, the screen looks beautiful, way better than the phones in the past.. The Bluetooth function works great, my last phone would lose its signal.. This phone is worth at least $500..

They also get unlimited full-res photo and video backup on Google Photos, 24/7 customer service, and the new Pixel Launcher interface.

FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Pixel XL: How do Google’s first self-branded phones compare?. Google has finally unveiled the long-awaited and heavily rumored Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL smartphones, boasting some of the best specs in the business, as well as heavy Android. integration, a top-notch camera, and more. In fact, these phones have the specs to match up against any flagship device out there.. But how do the two new phones compare to each other? Are there any advantages to one over the other? We put the two new Google phones head to head to find out.. 5.6 x 2.7 x 0.2-0.3-inches (143.8 x 69.5 x 7.3-8.5mm). 6.0 x 2.9 x 0.2-0.34-inches (154.7 x 75.7 x 7.3-8.5mm). GSM / CDMA / HSPA / LTE. GSM / CDMA / HSPA / LTE. Very Silver, Quite Black, Really Blue. Very Silver, Quite Black, Really Blue. As it turns out, there’s really very little comparison to make.. Both the Pixel and Pixel XL feature Qualcomm’s latest and great mobile processor, the Snapdragon 821, as well as 4GB of RAM and options for either 32GB or 128GB of storage. Those certainly aren’t bad specs at all. The Snapdragon 821 is around 10 percent faster than the already-fast Snapdragon 820, ensuring that all those apps you install over the next few years continue to run smoothly and without a hitch.. When it comes to RAM, it’s potentially another story. There are indeed phones out there with a hefty 6GB of RAM, like the OnePlus 3, however, that doesn’t necessarily mean faster or better performance — just look at the iPhone. While it has traditionally had less RAM, because of how deeply software and hardware are integrated, the iPhone outperforms almost all others on the market.. Both Google Pixel phones are shaping up to be very high performers, but they’re about as powerful as each other — there’s no winner here.. There’s also no winner in the design department. The phones feature an identical look, except the Pixel XL is a little larger.. The overall look of the phone certainly isn’t bad at all. It features a relatively premium look, that’s slightly off compared to other flagship devices. That’s largely because of the fact that half of the back is made from a metal body, while the top half of the back is made from glass — that’s the half with the fingerprint sensor and the camera.. The glass does make the phone look unique, but it also looks a little like plastic, slightly detracting from the perceived quality of the device.. On the bottom of the phone, you’ll find a USB-C port and two slots. Don’t mistake those for stereo speakers — it seems like one of them is a speaker and the other a microphone slot. It’s nice that they look the same though, as it contributes to the phone’s symmetry. On the left edge, you’ll find the SIM tray, and on the right, you’ll find both the power buttons and the volume rocker. On the back, as is expected, you’ll find the fingerprint sensor, as well as the camera, which is relatively small and located in the top left-hand corner of the back.. In general, the phone looks nice, if not slightly odd. Still, there’s obviously no winner, since they’re identical. You can get both in silver, black, and blue.. Finally, something we can actually compare. The battery capacity on the Pixel is 2,770mAh, while that of the Pixel XL sits at 3,450mAh. Still, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that the extra battery merely powers the larger display for the same amount of time. Google, however, rates the Pixel XL as having a much longer battery life — it says the device can last as long as 32 hours of talk time, compared to the standard Pixel’s 26 hours. That’s an extra 6 hours, which is no small figure.. Both devices also feature quick charging, which gives them as much as 7 hours of use through only 15 minutes of charging. With the much longer battery capacity, the Pixel XL is the clear winner.. The battery isn’t the only thing that’s different between the two phones — the display also offers a point of difference. Both displays are AMOLED, however the display on the Pixel XL is a little larger — and boasts a higher resolution.. While the display on the Google Pixel is 5-inches and has a resolution of. 1,080 x 1,920 pixels, the Pixel XL takes things a step further by offering a 5.5-inch display with a resolution of. Even with the larger size, the Pixel XL’s display is sharper, boasting 534 pixels-per-inch compared to the Pixel’s 441ppi.. There’s a clear winner here, and that’s the Google Pixel XL.. The camera is identical on the two phones, and according to Google, it’s a good one. The rear-facing camera is 12 megapixels with an aperture of f/2.0, and while that may not technically offer as great low-light photos as other cameras, Google says the camera is the best smartphone camera ever built. Obviously, that remains to be seen once reviews start coming out, but its a good sign nonetheless. Of course, those low-light shots are also aided by the relatively large. 1.55µm pixel size, which is able to draw in more light than other cameras with smaller pixel sizes, so the camera’s performance in low-light situations remains to be seen.. On the front of the device, you’ll find an 8-megapixel shooter, which is a far higher resolution than most front-facing cameras. That’s nice for the selfie-lovers out there, although it’s nice to have even for those that aren’t that into selfies.. Even better — all those photos you take can be backed up for free to Google Photos in original quality.. Both of the phones will ship with Android 7.1 Nougat, which is Google’s latest version of Android. The operating system has all the great new features found in Android 7.1, as well as a few more. The most notable? Google Assistant integration. Google Assistant is Google’s latest and greatest digital assistant, aimed at creating a “conversation” between users and Google. Assistant isn’t just a great way to interact with Google services — it’s also a great way to integrate with third-party apps, as Google is allowing third-party integration through “Actions on Google.”. new version of Android also brings features like Night Light, which changes the colors shown on the screen to. Perhaps the coolest feature on the Pixel, however, is Daydream compatibility. Daydream turns your phone into a virtual reality device, and really takes things to the next level compared to systems like Google Cardboard. Thankfully, if you pre-order the Pixel, you’ll also get a Daydream View headset for free so you can try out Daydream without having to pay anything extra.. You’ll also get automatic software updates, which is awesome. No other Android phone will get new versions of Android or security patches faster than the Pixel phones.. While the Pixel XL offers a better display and a higher battery life, those things obviously come at a price — the Pixel XL costs $120 more than the standard Google Pixel.. Apart from pricing, there’s an availability issue — the Pixel and Pixel XL are currently only available at Verizon, or you can get them unlocked. We recommend you buy them unlocked from Google, no matter your carrier. That way, you won’t have to be stuck with a carrier for two years. The Pixel and Pixel XL can both be pre-ordered now, with shipping expected in 2-3 weeks. Here’s a quick rundown of pricing.. $650, $27.08 per month for 24 months. $750, $31.24 per month for 24 months. $770, 32.08 per month for 24 months. $870, $36.24 per month for 24 months. $650, $27.04 per month for 24 months. $750, $31.21 per month for 24 months. $770, $32.04 per month for 24 months. $870, $36.21 per month for 24 months. Obviously, the Google Pixel XL is the “better” phone, but the better battery and display resolution don’t come free. If you’re really into the larger screen or want a longer battery life, then you’re going to have to shell out the extra cash — but if not, there’s good news: you can get a phone with nearly equally good specs at a cheaper price..

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. As I wrap up my first month with the Pixel XL, there are a few observations that are worth noting about Google’s ‘first’ smartphone that weren't apparent in my initial review .. OK Google, what else do you do?. The most striking obserbation is how little I use Google Assistant. In the first few days I peppered it with constant commands, testing out its limits. Once I discovered its limits, I gradually stopped using it.. The issue with Google Assistant is the ‘assistant’ part. At the moment using the Assistant in Allo, for example, gives you some nicely packaged-up Google searches. Which is fine and saves you wading through lots of information. But where’s the deeper control? Why can’t I dim my display by asking Assistant? Why can’t Assistant download and setup apps for me on request?. It also needs to be more active. I want push notifications of places to eat nearby when I’m in a particular area, or the ability to quickly add events to my calendar from messaging apps (the pop-up menu when you highlight text should have an ‘add to calendar’ option).. Whilst Assistant impresses, it’s limited functionality puts you off from using it. Perhaps I’m just a pessimist, but when I want to perform an action, I assume Assistant won’t be able to do it. Which puts me off from asking. It’s the same with Amazon’s Alexa.. Elsewhere, my initial concerns about the design wearing easily appears to be prescient. The seam between the display and the chassis easily damages and it’s getting worse. A case would solve this, of course. But it shouldn’t be so easily scratched by everyday use.. The Pixel XL appears to wear easily. The all-metal, rough-textured design still impresses me, however. Maybe I haven’t had the Pixel XL long enough, but I still like to twirl it around in my hand and appreciate the design. Even the rear-facing glass panel has grown on me.. The bottom-left placed speaker was a bad design choice, too. Your finger or palm almost always appears to obscures it. Fortunately the volume of sound that the Pixel XL gives off is enough to permeate through your finger to still be audible, but that doesn't make-up for the poorly thought-out speaker placement.. Performance-wise I’ve noticed some minor stability issues. I’ve had the occasional app refuse to open - forcing a restart for it work - and the odd freeze. The latter possibly being an app issue. With that said, these problems are in the minority.. My overall takeaway, however, is that it’s a fast, powerful device. From unlocking to opening an app you notice how smooth, and quick, the process is.. But it's the battery that is the stand-out performance feature. I’ve forgotten what it’s like to have to constantly worry where your next charge is coming from. 2016 has not been a good year for battery life when it comes to smartphones. It remains the one area that’s yet to advance, which is thanks to the few developments in battery technology.. I’m comfortably getting 18 hours between charges with medium use during the day, including music, browsing and gaming on commutes, and leaving it to rest overnight without plugging in. A couple factors are at play here; Android’s improved power management and Doze 2.0, which conserves battery when the phone isn’t in use or physically moving (which is why I’m losing under 10% of battery overnight).. It’s helped by how quickly the battery charges. It’s not the fastest - LG and Samsung are leading that race - but a full charge takes just under 90 minutes. And I rarely charge to 100% because that’s bad for your battery, so I charge to about 70%, which takes around an hour. An hour a day of charging for 18 hours use is a good return..

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Portrait mode in particular is interesting because Google decided it didnât need a secondary zoom lens to achieve it. The background bokeh effect is obviously artificial to the trained eye, but itâs nice to achieve it without having to move the phone in an upward arc like with the Lens Blur from the previous generation. The best part is it works for the front-facing camera, as well. The Pixel 2 is probably the phone that all selfie addicts will want thanks to this portrait mode, but even without it, the 8MP shooter is a marked improvement from pretty much any other front-facing camera.. Google Pixel 2 XL camera samples. Google’s follow-ups their first flagships, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, are finally out. By most accounts they’re great phones, but how do they stack up to last year’s model? The original Pixels were well received, but they weren’t perfect, and we want see what improvements have been made to the Pixel formula.. Following up on our Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL review , this is the Google Pixel 2 XL vs the original Pixel XL.. Last yearâs Pixel set a precedent. Google jumped into the hardware game and really gave Android a place to call home. The phone wasnât without issues, though.. The Pixel definitely wasn’t the most attractive phone. A glass panel on the upper back portion seemed like an odd choice and, aside from the Really Blue version, there wasnât much else exciting about its looks.. The Pixel 2 proves we shouldn’t look to Google for hardware innovation. Let's not beat around the bush: Google doesn't really know all that much about making phones. This is why it historically shipped out Nexus contracts to those that do and probably also why it didn't â¦. Maybe we needed a little bit of time to get used to it, but the glass panel has definitely become a staple of the Pixel line of devices, including more than just phones. And the glass window looks better on the Pixel 2 XL â actually, we think the new Pixels look miles ahead of the originals.. The feel and handling of the new Pixels is helped along by a coating that gives the phones more texture and grip. They arenât the most unique looking phones, but their somewhat generic simplicity proves to be endearing.. The phones’ design elements are there for obvious reasons, without any flourishes. The bezels are far more acceptable on both Pixel 2s, though the smaller one had to keep the forehead and chin pretty big to fit the front facing speakers.. Minimalism might be the Achillesâ heel of the Pixel 2. Minimalism, however, might be the Achillesâ heel of the Pixel 2, as Google decided to shave off the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack. This is a controversial move for any phone. If you are still using the original Pixel, might might be one of reasons not to upgrade. We think you’d be missing out, though. Pixel 2 XL users can upgrade to the 18:9 aspect ratio screen, which is easier to handle thanks to its smaller side bezels and slender form factor.. The screens are a big difference between iterations. The larger Pixel phones both sport Quad HD displays, but the shift to an LG-supplied OLED screen for the Pixel 2 XL has proven to be a little rocky. We can actually use the original Pixel XL for comparison, because that phone uses a Samsung OLED that has received no major criticism. Saturation seems to be dialed back on the Pixel 2 XL, which might be a bummer to those who are used to OLED panels pumping out a ton of colors. The Pixel XL is also a bit brighter.. Don’t miss: Why I am put off by the Pixel 2 XL display, but you might not be. Another problem with the Pixel 2 XL has to do with the viewing angles. While we have yet to figure out why, the colors on the display get cooler (and turn somewhat blueish) when viewing it at an angle, and it doesnât even have to be an acute angle. The viewing experience on the Pixel 2 XL is still enjoyable and doesnât even fall very far behind the original. If youâre heavy into VR, this might require a bit of consideration but even then, we donât think itâs a huge deal.. So now, letâs get beneath the surface. The Pixels both sport the best processing packages of their respective release years, with the original XL rocking the Snapdragon 821 and this year’s device rocking the 835. The rest of the specs are unsurprising with 4GB of RAM and high storage capacities available for higher prices in either case. Neither phone has SD card slots. The Pixel 2 XLâs battery is a tiny bit bigger, but we didnât have much trouble with the original Pixel XL and the same seems to be the case with the 2 XL so far.. Full details: Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL specs. These specs are supported by a greatly streamlined version of Android, which many users agree is the wholeÂ. To that end, the software has been an absolute joy, not just because of the updates to Oreo , but because of how the Pixel 2 XL takes advantage of them.. Weâre already using Active Edge more than any other method of launching Assistant. Sure, you can update the original Pixel to the latest version of Android , but it won’t be the same experience. Google has added in just enough to make the Pixel 2 feel significantly different. Case in point, the Active Edge. Squeeze the bottom half of the device and the phone will immediately launch Google Assistant. Considering the search bar is now at the bottom of the launcher, and you can still hold the home button down or use the âOkay Googleâ hot-word, there are plenty of ways to launch the Assistant. But weâre already using the Active Edge more than any other method. Simply take the phone out, squeeze, and say anything you need â whether youâre googling something, checking your agenda, or even opening applications, Google Assistant can make it happen. The Active Edge tangibly improves user experience and convenience in the transition from Pixel to Pixel 2.. Other software additions include the Now Playing feature in the new Always-on Display, both features that the Pixel 2 gained over its predecessor. The Ambient Display feature of the original Pixels was fine and could be triggered pretty easily. But having certain information available at a glance is a small luxury that stock Android can finally provide in this yearâs phones.. More info: Here’s how the Now Playing feature works on the new Pixels. Now Playing is always actively listening for music so that it can display the soundtrack of your life, which has already come in handy plenty of times. Those songs definitely sound better on the front facing speakers of the Pixel 2, which also improve the mobile gaming experience.. Last yearâs Pixel was lauded for having a great picture experience The highpoint of last yearâs camera was the addition of HDR+, an always-on mode that attempted to add a pleasing saturation to what was already a highly detailed and accurate photo. Photos from either the 12MP rear shooter or the 8MP front-facing camera were somewhat enhanced and Google’s software proved very finely tuned.. The Pixel 2 camera gets high marks pretty much everywhere. Google continued developing its camera software this year to great effect. The megapixel is the same, but the apertures are even better. Thereâs no dual camera on the Pixel 2, because Google is incredibly confident that its data-driven image processing still provides detailed and pleasing photos. Theyâre not wrong, either; the pictures from the Pixel 2 are simply stunning. Photos are detailed even when zooming in, and the extra saturation means youâll be able to use the pictures for more than just forgettable social media posts.. Pixel Visual Core: A closer look at the Pixel 2’s hidden chip. Recently it was revealed that Google's new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL come packing a hidden and not yet activated Pixel Visual Core chip. According to Google, the secondary chip is designed to compile â¦. For anyone that just wants to hit a button and get great results, either of these phones will do the job and do it well. But portrait mode is sure to be an invaluable tool for selfies and itâs available in both the Pixel 2 cameras.. The Pixel 2 XL introduces a lot of improvements over the Pixel XL. The choice is pretty simple when you factor in the improved camera experience and the additions Google made to the already great Pixel formula. They even managed to make a phone that looks at least halfway decent this year. The little missteps like the lack of headphone jack and the weird screen issues might put some off. But the drawbacks are greatly outweighed by the overall experience of the Pixel 2.. Now read: Google Pixel 2 XL vs Galaxy Note 8. If you want a reliable, speedy, and simply great Android experience for an affordable price, getting your hands on a discounted Pixel XL is the best option.

Pixel and Pixel XL review: Google designs its own phones. Everyone else making Android phones should be a little worried.. Google's fascination with hardware stretches back years. Remember the early days of Android and the G1 ? The rise of the Nexus line? Those ill-fated Android@Home lightbulbs and those beautiful Chromebooks ? It took Google a while, but that fascination turned into a sort of experimental hobby, and now into something far more serious. Software is Google's art, and the company has been working for a long time to craft the right canvases.. That's where the new Pixel and Pixel XL come in.. Google has more control over the development -- and destiny -- of these two smartphones than it ever had with any Nexus phone. It's not surprising, then, that the company has turned to close friends to help chart this new course. Former Motorola Mobility CEO Rick Osterloh is back at Google heading up hardware after the search giant sold his company to Lenovo. HTC, which most recently worked with Google on the Nexus 9 tablet , is handling the Pixel phones' production and assembly. There's a palpable sense that Google wanted to round up its A-team for this project.. These Pixel phones are a culmination on Google's part of years' worth of experimenting with hardware, and they're unsurprisingly great.. After years of experimenting with Nexus devices, Google finally decided it wanted to make a phone of its own. HTC might be assembling the phones, but Google designed and developed the Pixel from end-to-end. In doing so, it crafted a truly great smartphone that sadly looks a little dull. Still, the inclusion of a speedy new Snapdragon 821 chipset and a fantastic camera make the smaller Pixel a device to be reckoned with. Now, if only it were a little cheaper.. The 5-inch Pixel is a great phone, and its big brother, the Pixel XL, is ever so slightly better. You'll get the same top-tier performance as on the smaller model, just with a bigger, crisper display and a more capacious battery to sweeten the deal. What's more, it's a little narrower and shorter than the iPhone 7 Plus, so it's a surprisingly easy to hold. It'll cost you, though: The XL starts at $769 for the 32GB model.. In case the names didn't tip you off, the Pixel ($649+) and Pixel XL ($769+) are identical -- one's just bigger than the other. Both phones are hewn from the same blend of aerospace-grade aluminum and Gorilla Glass, and they're put together with the sort of attention to detail HTC is famous for. The Pixel and the XL feel lighter than they look, which is the sort of thing that could throw old-school HTC fans for a loop: The trademark density of the company's metal designs is noticeably absent.. Don't worry, though: Both versions of the Pixel feel reassuringly sturdy, and comfortable too -- their curved backs nestled nicely into my hands. After years of getting used to bigger and bigger smartphones, I personally prefer the Pixel XL's balance of comfort and usability. The XL is a little shorter and narrower than the iPhone 7 Plus too, which means more people should be able to comfortably use it.. Both phones also have excellent 12.3-megapixel rear cameras (much more on that later), paired with a way-above-average 8-megapixel camera for selfies. Our review units came with 32GB of non-expandable storage, of which 24GB was available from the get-go; needless to say, you should definitely consider the $100 upgrade to the 128GB model. Gallery: Google Pixel and Pixel XL review | 34 Photos. Display and sound Software The Pixel advantage Camera. Moving on, you'll find a USB Type-C port on the bottom edge of either phone, flanked by a microphone and a surprisingly clear speaker. A microSIM slot rests on the phone's left edge, while the headphone jack lives up top. Ready for the sad part? While other flagship phone makers have figured out how to make their devices more life-proof despite those holes, the Pixels will only partially resist dust and water. The exact rating is IP53, but the big takeaway is that these pricey new phones can't deal with dirt or submersion as well as the new iPhones or Samsung's most recent Galaxy devices.. Meanwhile, the differences between the two Pixels are exactly what you'd expect. The Pixel XL has a 5.5-inch Quad HD AMOLED display, a step up from the 5-inch 1080p panel on the regular Pixel. At 3,450mAh, the Pixel XL's battery is among the largest we've seen in a flagship Android phone this year, and it's a clear leap over the 2,770mAh battery used in the smaller model. Unlike, say, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which have significantly different camera setups, there's no exciting difference between the Pixel and the Pixel XL.. With all that said, I wish the Pixels looked a little more distinctive. The iPhone comparisons are inevitable and not out of line, but even beyond that, there's a distinct lack of character on display here. As I've said, though, Google's true art is software, and one could argue this low-key design was meant to let that software really own the spotlight. That, or Google just doesn't have a great grasp on what beautiful hardware looks like yet.. That would explain why the Pixels' faces are mostly empty except for the front-facing camera, earpiece and infrared proximity sensor that sit above the screen. You'll find that same amount of space below the display too, except it's totally empty -- there's just a big helping of bezel that serves no purpose. The whole thing feels kind of austere, but things start to change when you turn the phone over. There you'll find a pane of very slightly curved (aka "2.5D") Gorilla Glass covering the top third of the phone's back, with one of Google's excellent Nexus Imprint fingerprint sensors sitting near the bottom of the glass.. That glass panel is an ... interesting design choice, to say the least. The reflective glass makes it easy to tell which side is up when you pick up the phone without looking, and it also acts as a window to let RF signals move more easily through the phone. (Think of it as the evolution of the Nexus 6P's trademark black bar.) The glass feels nice and has so far resisted scratches, but the look just isn't for me. A shame, considering it's the one truly distinctive thing about the Pixels' design language. At least the Nexus Imprint sensor does a great job picking up my fingerprints; the Pixels very rarely bugged me for another attempt.. Oh, and while we're still on the subject of looks, the finish that Google calls Quite Black isn't actually black at all. It's more of a gunmetal gray, and while that probably isn't a dealbreaker, it would've been nice to get a Pixel that was properly black, like the gorgeous Note 7. (The Pixels are also available in Very Silver and Really Blue, which are meh and kinda nice, respectively.). Are you picking up on a theme here? For the most part, the components Google and HTC have stuck in the Pixels are first-rate -- my inner '90s child would even say they're primo. They're just sort of let down by their sense of style, or lack thereof. (It doesn't help either that they can't deal with water very well.) Those are things Google could fix for next year's Pixels (assuming they make any), but the promise of future improvement doesn't do anything for the phones we have here.. If you were worried that Google would skimp on the screens, relax -- both Pixels have great displays. No curved edges or tiny secondary panels; just crisp, bright AMOLED screens with the sort of punchy, vivid colors these kinds of displays are known for. In fact, I could see colors perhaps being a little too punchy for some people. While the iPhone 7 Plus and its wide color display rendered a mountain scene at twilight with periwinkle skies, the Pixel and Pixel XL made those same skies look bright aqua. Google and HTC's approach is more viscerally pleasing, but whether or not it's better is mostly a matter of taste. Both screens also offer great viewing angles, though you'll notice a little color distortion if you're looking from too oblique an angle.. I've been talking about the Pixel's and Pixel XL's screens in the same breath, but it's worth noting once more that they aren't strictly identical. Beyond the extra detail made possible by its higher-resolution display, the Pixel XL's screen seems a little brighter and its color temperature comes off a touch cooler. That makes all of the stark white found throughout Android and your apps seem crisper, which I actually really like. Don't get me wrong: The smaller Pixel's screen is really quite good, but the XL's blend of Quad HD detail and more pleasant colors make it the one to own if you've got the cash.. I was pleasantly surprised by the speakers tucked into the Pixel and the Pixel XL, though maybe I shouldn't have been. These phones were built by HTC, after all. Alas, though, you won't find any crazy stereo speaker setups here -- just a single, loud driver wedged into the bottom of each Pixel. These days my diet consists of electro-crooners like Chvrches and Lemaitre, and their respective vocals came through crisply and clearly. Even songs that focus heavily on drums -- like "Caravan" from the Whiplash soundtrack -- fare well, though you'll probably pick up on some muddiness when there are lots of highs and lows banging around at the same time. These speakers certainly won't replace an external set, but they're more than enough to listen to podcasts or sing along with new tracks without feeling like you're missing something.. The Pixels are the very first phones to ship with Android 7.1 Nougat , and, obviously, the first to offer Google's new Pixel Launcher experience. There's a lot to unpack, so let's talk about the core first: Android 7.1. Google was quick to call this new build an "incremental update" that builds on the progress made with the still-new Nougat update. (You can sift through our full Android 7.0 review here .) Incremental is right. Beyond the usual batch of bug fixes and system optimizations, there are only a handful of new features to play with.. Funnily enough, the most notable addition is also the one you're most likely to discover by accident. Long-pressing certain app icons now brings up a list of actions you can jump straight into, much like how Quick Actions work with 3D Touch as of iOS 9. The thing is, Apple's approach is more elegant. In iOS, you have to physically press the screen to access those shortcuts, a step that makes accidental actions unlikely. Here, though, you can't tell which apps have shortcuts until you long-press them; if there aren't any shortcuts, Android thinks you want to move that app icon to your home screen.. Since the Android 7.1 developer preview won't go live until later this month, the only apps that have these shortcuts enabled are ones made by Google -- long-pressing the Gmail icon offers a "compose" option, while doing that to the Calendar icon lets you quickly create a new appointment. All told, 17 of the preloaded Google apps have shortcuts for you to play with, and they're useful if you remember they're there. Thankfully, you can grab those shortcuts and drag them to your home screen for even quicker access.. Android 7.1 also brings the ability to send images straight from keyboard apps, so it's easier than ever to harass your friends with GIFs. Developers can build support for GIFs, stickers and other image formats into their keyboards, but Google's approach is already pretty damn useful. When pecking out a message in a compatible app -- like the stock Messenger -- tapping the emoji icon also reveals a GIF window you can use to search for the perfect animation. And yes, there's some naughty-ish stuff to be found. Google has blocked most of the really vulgar images, but you can definitely get more crude than you can on iOS. Throw in support for round app icons (like the ones on the Pixels), along with Daydream support (which I wasn't able to test yet), and we've already covered the biggest changes to Nougat.. You can buy the Pixels straight from a carrier store, but you'll have to deal with a little software meddling in the process. I tossed a Verizon SIM into one of my review units during the setup process, and wouldn't you know it -- the phone started downloading three Verizon apps from the Play Store. Verizon's Messages+ and the Go90 streaming service got the uninstall treatment immediately, but the My Verizon account management app can be pretty helpful. I'm still curious to see how Verizon does with its promise to keep big software updates rolling out to Pixels in a timely fashion, but at least it took a light touch with bloatware this time.. Google wants you to feel special for buying into its vision of mobile computing -- that's why it's sweetening the deal with features you won't get on any other Android phone. Some of them are mostly cosmetic, like the redesigned setup flow and a calendar icon that shows you what the date is. Others, like the revamped Pixel Launcher interface, take a little more getting used to. All your Google Now cards still live to the left of the main home screen, but the conspicuous app launcher button is gone.. You can tap a tiny arrow above the favorite-apps tray to open the launcher if you really miss the old-school button; otherwise, the easiest way to go is to just swipe up from the bottom of the screen. That new swipe gesture feels natural, because it thematically mirrors how you pull down the notifications shade, and as far as I'm concerned, there's no going back. That persistent search bar is gone as well, which has thrown off just about everyone I've shown these phones to. The wallpaper picker has changed too, and Google has seen fit to trick out the Pixel and Pixel XL with some of the sweetest options I've seen on an Android device. The rest of the Pixels' exclusive features are pretty damn valuable. These phones come with unlimited full-resolution backups of photos and videos to Google Photos; everyone else can only store downsampled versions of photos for free. Since all that media can be backed up to the cloud automatically, you probably don't need it on the phones themselves. That's where the Pixels' exclusive Smart Storage feature comes in -- when you've blown through your 32GB or 128GB of storage, Android automatically clears up space by deleting photos and videos that have already been backed up. Feeling desperate for more space? You can manually force a cleanup, though your photos, videos and apps have to have gone untouched for a while before the system will let you trash them en masse.. Pop into the settings menu and you'll also see a new tab for support -- in case something goes awry, you can reach out to a Google rep to help you walk through things. During my testing, I managed to contact a technician in just a few minutes. They can be surprisingly helpful, too; you can even share your screen with them so they can see what's going on. I just hope this level of service doesn't drop off when more people start using these phones.. Google also made it surprisingly easy to migrate data from your old phone to your new Pixel, even if that old phone was made by Apple. I tried hooking up an iPhone 7 Plus to the Pixel XL during the initial setup process, and after about seven or eight minutes of chewing, my contacts and SMS threads appeared in their respective Android apps. Google didn't have to do this, but building a near-seamless way to help someone give up his or her old phone is seriously savvy.. And then, of course, there's the Google Assistant. If you've installed Allo, Google's new cross-platform messaging app, you're probably already acquainted. If not, it's dead simple to start chatting with it. Just hold down the home button or run through the voice training process and say, "OK Google." Familiar, no? From there, just start gabbing away. The Assistant can launch apps, find restaurants and points of interest nearby, translate things you say into different languages, and even just get answers to random questions. (As it turns out, Vladimir Putin is 64 years old.) I've been consistently surprised at how accurate its voice recognition has been too, since I tend to get a little mumbly from time to time.. Also impressive is how the Assistant can "remember" the context of a line of questioning, so you can speak to it the way you would to a person. Let's go back to that weird Putin example: After asking how old he is, I asked the Assistant, "Is he married?" The Assistant didn't skip a beat and confirmed that he had been until 2014. Machine learning has grown sophisticated enough for these interactions to become common -- Siri started tracking context with the launch of iOS 9 -- but it's still terribly neat to see in action.. All told, Google's Assistant is a surprisingly thoughtful system as long as you play within the range of prescribed actions. When it can't figure out a more appropriate way to respond, the Assistant just defaults to reading web search results. More often than not, though, those little tidbits read aloud were at least enough to point me in the right direction. Unfortunately, many of the third-party integrations Google showed off at its Pixel launch event don't work yet, so you won't be hailing Ubers or reserving a table at the Smith using just your voice.. Google didn't pull any punches at its Pixel unveiling -- VP Brian Rakowski proudly proclaimed that the cameras in these smartphones are the best anyone has ever made. And the kicker? A review from the independent mobile camera testers at DxOMark giving the Pixel and Pixel XL the top spot in its photographic rankings.. While not perfect, Google's pair of Pixels can indeed capture fantastic photos -- detailed and crisp, with mostly correct colors. It shouldn't surprise you to hear that the Pixel and Pixel XL excel in bright conditions, but their cameras are actually remarkable in dim situations too. That's partly due to the optics Google ran with here. The 12.3-megapixel cameras have a f/2.0 aperture -- that's not quite as wide an opening for light as on the iPhone 7, but still pretty good. The pixels on those sensors are pretty large too, at 1.55μm -- a trait this Sony sensor shares with last year's Nexus 6P.. Gallery: Google Pixel and Pixel XL camera samples | 32 Photos.

That's just part of the story, though: Google's HDR+ mode is back and works much better than it has in the past. Remember, many HDR camera modes capture one long exposure and then process that image to crank up the clarity and dynamic range. The Pixels' HDR+ modes, meanwhile, capture briefer exposures and basically stitch them together, reducing the likelihood of hand-induced blur. Thanks to the extra horsepower afforded by the Pixel's beefy chipset and a Hexagon coprocessor, that process is much faster now, resulting in more appealing shots in both dim and bright conditions without delay. It doesn't always work when you're shooting rapid-fire, but in general this is the first HDR mode I've wanted to leave on all the time.. Like I said, though, the Pixels' cameras aren't perfect. I occasionally noticed that the hybrid laser-and-phase-detection autofocus system got skittish while trying to lock onto a subject. Neither camera has optical image stabilization either, though the included electronic image stabilization does a good job keeping blur from becoming an issue. This is especially apparent when you're shooting video, as long as you're not expecting miracles. There's still some jitter to be found from time to time, alas.. The beauty of everything I just mentioned is that it generally happens behind the scenes. Google's Pixel camera app is more than happy to let you shoot in Auto (and get some impressive photos in the process), but persnickety photographers will appreciate the ability to lock exposure and focus and overlay grids over the live image to more easily frame up shots. If that's not you, well, you'll probably still enjoy Google's Smartburst feature, which lets you hold down the shutter button to capture a slew of shots in one go. From there, the phone stitches those frames together into a GIF (!) and lets you choose the best individual stills to keep.. Here's an interesting tidbit to chew on: Qualcomm says the Snapdragon 821's clock speed tops out at 2.4GHz, but the version used in both Pixel models is capped at 2.15GHz. In case you haven't been keeping track, that's as fast as the trusty Snapdragon 820s we've seen in just about every other flagship smartphone this year. Despite that, the Pixel and the Pixel XL feel snappier and more responsive than most of the other flagship phones I've tested this year. What gives? As far as Google was concerned, the real trick here was balancing sheer horsepower with battery life, so using a slightly slower version of the chipset seemed like the way to go. Google wasn't willing to sacrifice the sensation of speed, though, so it optimized how things were rendered on-screen, reduced touch latency and improved app launch times.. That said, you'd be wrong to think the Pixels were lacking in sheer processing power. My days include lots of frenzied multitasking -- think Slack, Outlook, YouTube, Spotify, Twitter, Instagram and more -- along with games like Mortal Kombat X and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Nothing, and I mean nothing, during this testing period managed to make the Pixel or Pixel XL break a sweat. Sure, they got a little warm from time to time, but their performance left me with no complaints.. Neither did the Pixels' batteries, as a matter of fact. Consider Engadget's standard rundown test, wherein we loop high-definition videos with the phone connected to WiFi and the screen brightness fixed at 50 percent. The more capacious XL was the obvious standout here -- it lasted 14 hours and 12 minutes, beating out the Galaxy Note 7 by just seven minutes. The smaller Pixel, meanwhile, managed 12 hours and 26 minutes before finally needing a trip to a power outlet.. Thankfully, both phones proved to be serious contenders in day-to-day use as well. After a full day of work, the XL would typically hover around 46 percent, and then, when my schedule quieted down, it just sipped on its remaining power. All told, I could reliably squeeze a day and a half of use out of it on a single charge, or closer to two workdays, even, when I took things slow.. The smaller Pixel fared well too, sticking around for a full day and clinging to life the next morning. You shouldn't feel too bad about forgetting to charge your Pixel before crashing, though: Google says the included fast charger will give you seven hours of usage after just 15 minutes plugged in. Your mileage may vary, but in general, I found leaving the Pixel and XL plugged in for 15 minutes added a 15 and 20 percent charge, respectively.. Now that the Galaxy Note 7 has been permanently discontinued , Samsung's heirs apparent to the Best Smartphone crown are the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. Before using the Pixels, I liked to think of these phones as the best all-around mobile cameras, and even now the race is closer than Google would like to admit. Beyond photography, they're impeccably built, gorgeously designed and powerful enough for just about anyone's daily routine. Still, having to deal with TouchWiz -- even in its improved form -- probably wouldn't sit well with the kind of people who would be drawn to the Pixel line in the first place.. The HTC 10 also runs a tweaked version of Android in the vein of TouchWiz, but you'd wind up with a device that shares some traits with the Pixels. Speedy performance and almost no touch latency? Yep. about that: The 10's 12-ultrapixel camera sensor has pixels just as large as what you'll find on the Pixel and Pixel XL, but Google's phones have a distinct edge.. Finally, for people not strictly married to Android, there's the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Apple basically recycled their design from last year, but looks are deceiving -- they're actually the company's most technically impressive phones to date. Apple's improved camera game puts the 7 and 7 Plus right up there with the Pixels and the Galaxy S7s when it comes to photography, but anyone itching for a truly "new" iPhone might want to wait a year anyway.. As the story goes, Google only really got to contribute to Nexus phones once they were 90 percent done. That's crazy, isn't it? I loved the Nexus line from day one, but it always felt clear that Google was just experimenting with things while its hardware partners took on most of the risk. Now Google is sticking its own neck out there, and the market -- no, the people -- won't stand for mediocrity.. Thankfully, the Pixels are much, much better than that. They certainly have their share of shortcomings, like a drab design, wimpy water resistance and some hefty price tags. The thing is, Google had to start somewhere, and the foundation it built with these two phones is a surprisingly strong one. These aren't just great first attempts at smartphones; these are great smartphones, period, and every other Android device maker out there should be a little worried.. android , gear , google , mobile , nougat , pixel , pixelxl , review , smartphone.

Pixel and Pixel XL are Android smartphones designed, developed and marketed by Google. They were announced during a press event on October 4, 2016, and serve as the first smartphones in the Google Pixel hardware line, succeeding the Nexus line of smartphones. On October 4, 2017, they were succeeded by the second-generation Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL .. The Pixels have an aluminum chassis, with a glass panel on the rear, a USB-C connector, 3.5. mm headphone jack , and a 12.3. At launch, the devices featured certain exclusive software features, including the 7.1 "Nougat" update to the Android operating system , integration with the Google Assistant intelligent personal assistant , live technical support services, and unlimited full-resolution Google Photos backup for the life of the device.. They were called "the best Android phones you can buy" and received praise for camera quality and performance. However, they were criticised for their high prices and lack of waterproofing , and some critics noted design similarities to Apple 's iPhone. The Pixels have suffered from a variety of issues after release, including excessive optical lens flare in pictures captured through the rear camera, connectivity issues with some mobile data bands , unstable Bluetooth connections, unexpected battery shutdowns, and failing microphones. Google has acknowledged and released fixes for most of the issues.. Google previously co-developed flagship Android devices with original equipment manufacturers through the Nexus program, which were designed to be "reference" devices for the Android platform, but the devices retained similarities to other devices made by their respective partners. [3] Rick Osterloh, former president of Motorola , joined Google as its senior vice president of hardware in April 2016, [4] and Google initiated development of an ecosystem of in-house products and platforms, including the Google Home smart speaker, Google Assistant intelligent personal assistant , and Google Daydream , Google's new virtual reality platform built for Android Nougat. [5] The Pixels were announced on October 4, 2016, [6] and serve as Google's launch devices for Android 7.1 "Nougat". Osterloh said in an interview with The Verge that "a lot of the innovation that we want to do now ends up requiring controlling the end-to-end user experience". The Verge wrote that the Nexus program had "fulfilled its mission", with a Google spokesperson stating that there are "no plans" to make another Nexus device. [3] The Pixel was designed by and is marketed as being a Google product; although the company used HTC as a contract manufacturer , Google has said that the Pixels are not based on any existing HTC device. [3] It offered Huawei the contract to manufacture the devices, but after Google refused to dual-brand the phone with credit to the manufacturer, Huawei declined the offer. In the United States, Pixel is exclusive to Verizon Wireless and Project Fi , but also available direct-to-consumer via Google's online store [9] [3] or from Best Buy. [10] [11] In the United Kingdom, they are available direct-to-consumer via Google's online store, and through EE , and Carphone Warehouse. [12] In India, they became available for preorder from October 13 from Flipkart , Reliance Digital , and Cromā , [13] with general store availability on October 25. On October 4, 2017, Google announced the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones, succeeding the original Pixel devices. Pixel uses an aluminum chassis, with a glass panel on the portion of the rear housing the camera and "Pixel Imprint" fingerprint sensor. The phones have a USB-C connector supporting USB 3.0 , for power and data exchange. The phone features a 3.5 mm headphone jack , which received media attention for being a contrast to competing smartphone Apple iPhone 7 , which does not feature the port. [16] The Pixel and Pixel XL both use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 system-on-chip, with 4. [17] [18] They are offered with either 32. GB of UFS 2.0 internal storage. The two models are differentiated by screen and battery size; the standard Pixel's display measures 5. mm) 1080p AMOLED with a 2770 mAh battery, [19] while the Pixel XL's display measures 5.5. mm) 1440p AMOLED with a 3450 mAh battery. Pixel features a 12.3-megapixel rear-facing camera, which uses an f/2.0 aperture, and a Sony IMX378 sensor with 1.55. [21] The camera uses a digital image stabilization system tied to the phone's gyroscope and motion sensors at a sampling rate of 200. [2] To improve capture speed, 30 frames are continuously captured per second while the camera is active. When a photo is taken, up to 10 of these frames are composed to form a single image. Pixel and Pixel XL ship with Android 7.1 "Nougat" , an update to 7.0 that was initially exclusive to the Pixel. It was released for existing Nexus devices in December 2016, but certain features remain exclusive to Pixel. Pixel supports Google Assistant , and provides live technical support services integrated into the OS. Similarly to Nexus devices, it receives Android updates directly from Google. [6] [26] Pixel also supports the Google Daydream virtual reality platform. [6] All Pixel smartphones include unlimited full-resolution Google Photos backup for the life of the device. [6] [22] A November 2016 update added additional motion gestures, including double-tapping the screen to show alerts, and raising the device to wake the screen and raise-to-wake features. Google states on its support pages that the Pixel and Pixel XL are guaranteed to receive new Android version updates until October 2018, and guaranteed to receive security patches until October 2019. [28] [29] In August 2017, Google released Android 8.0 "Oreo" for the Pixel and Pixel XL. [30] Android 8.1 Oreo was released for the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as some other devices, on December 5, 2017. All Pixel and Pixel XL models are multi-band devices .. For an explanation of LTE frequency band numbers, see LTE frequency bands .. The Pixel and Pixel XL received mixed reviews. Dieter Bohn of The Verge said the Pixel smartphones are "...easily the best Android phones you can buy" and gave the product a 9 out of 10, praising its long battery life and Google Assistant integration. However, Bohn did not like its pedestrian design and lack of waterproofing. [36] Matt Humrick of AnandTech praised the camera being flush with the body, but was critical of the price, stating that Nexus fans who were looking for a more affordable option would be disappointed. [37] Chris Velazco of Engadget praised the build quality, camera, and performance, but criticized the high price, and lack of proper water-resistance present in rivals, such as the iPhone 7 and the Samsung Galaxy S7. [38] Writing for Ars Technica , Ron Amadeo said of the phone, "[it has] unbeatable software and support with a great camera, wrapped in a familiar exterior." [39] Zach Epstein of BGR wrote in February 2017 that "There’s also no question that the phones feature a design that is sleek and impressive, yet all too familiar. Yes, that’s a nice way of saying that Google blatantly ripped off the iconic design that Apple has used on its iPhones for the past three generations." [40]. In June 2017, Ars Technica reported that Google Play 's app for the Pixel Launcher, an app pre-installed on all Pixel phones, had been downloaded between one million and five million times. Although the report acknowledged the measurement's imprecision, the publication credited it for providing the first possible sales numbers.
