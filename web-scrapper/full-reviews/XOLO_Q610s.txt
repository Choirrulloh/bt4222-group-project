XOLO Q610s - user opinions and reviews. Pages: « 1 2 3 4 5 ». From 3rd day It hangs and in 10 days it completely shut down. This is review of the phone but worst comes next. The service center told they need 20 days to repair it. When in 20 days I didn't receive my phone, I sent lots of mail to the xolo service care with invoices, workorder order and their number. but each time iIreceive same mail with query date in subject line. "Thank you for making us aware with your grievance. This is in reference to your email dated 03.11.2014 regarding your complaint for your XOLO Smartphone. We request you to kindly share the work order number(310000+) so that we may able to provide resolution further. While the work order number was available in mail.". No ticket number!! nothing!! so that I can refer it in next mail. Finally i got the cell phone after 52 days. Phone is a disaster while the service center is the icing on the cake.. Rajat.., 01 Nov 2014 My Opinion for xolo q610s is that 2 improve the battery back up, as it is not at all good, on ... more Use the "APUS" theme in your Xolo Q610s and it gives a good battery packup.. i am about it for buying plz tell me frnds. is support pdf file or not?. My Opinion for xolo q610s is that 2 improve the battery back up, as it is not at all good, on the other hand phone is excellent , i have no complains regarding to the apps,resolution camera etc.. Lookwise also phone is good, it has BEEN given leathery finish which looks classy while holding in hand.. at last i would like to suggest the company to improve the battery of XOLO Q610S... as it is only 1700 mah where that of XOLO Q600S has 2000 mah.... I am using Xolo Q610S model Smartphone for a past one week, I am very happy for this phone in this best price, but I agree some demerits about battery backup, I updated some merits and demerits of this model. Good dimension, thickness 9.3 mm ( so slim),. We can install the apps in SD card ( for Moto  E installing in internal only). Good Rear camera 5Mpx with LED flash and HD recording, Front 0.3 Mpx (VGA only). Mobile pack comes with screen guard, back case and require apps ( we need not to install like FB, quick office, file manager, gallery, videos and browser). Even without internet the battery getting discharged for videos and games. It battery range is 1700mhr only, so it will manage only 8 -10 hours. Phone getting heat in backside while playing games and long time usage.. I m using dis phone frm last 1mnth. Gud phone at dis cost range. Battery backup is really surprising g..its nt at all gud. Phone starts heating from back side wen charged. No flipcover..not available online or at stores. Over all a gud phone agn went to an average region. Phone is good....I will say it is excellent in its range..!. I brought it for 62000 and I don't think I have wasted my money. For battery backup its not up to date but still it runs for full one day when using 2g ntwrk. People complaining about battery backup are stupid. If that want a fone for larger battery backup..that should buy fonea of battery rating above 1700 mAh. It has only one problem that it does not supports 1080p videos. From my side...its a gud fone and I m using it from 3 months..and it is best smart fone in its range.. Firoz Tamboli, 21 Oct 2014 Many people saying battery back up is not good & phone heating from back side is is true.. Stand by only 6 to 7 hours, even mobile in not use. I am using this last three days. Many people saying battery back up is not good & phone heating from back side is is true.. Not avaible the Flip cover Why?. nice look , good screen resolution , good camera but poor battery backup. This phone is 1.3 GHz Quad Core processor, not Dual-core. Battery back-up is not up to the standard, will get only one day.. how is the battery life of xolo q610s and perfamenceis better or not. There is 1.3 giga hertz quad core porcessor,not 1.3 dual core processor.so,correctit for better and realistic information for viewrs.. phone looks good v hot while charging battery low storage campass not supporting.

Xolo Q610s: Affordable, Powerful and Basic! The domestic market has been pretty well invaded by the likes of Micromax and Xolo which are some of the bigger names associated. The latest Xolo Q610s is certainly one of the better budget performers which pack in quite a lot for the given price range. Be it the screen size or the enhanced specs sheet, the Q610s is certainly a better performer which comes good for the user who is looking to abide by the affordable notions. The display looks pretty good whereas the involved design cues complement the layout pretty competently. Pros: The dual-SIM support is worth a few accolades whereas the screen size is pretty respectable at 4.5 inches. RAM allotment is basic but sizeable whereas the latest android functionality has many takers as well. Cons: Camera modules are weaker whereas the processor leaves much to be desired even with the acceptable performances put through. Screen resolution is on the lower side which keeps the layout pretty dim and dull. The Xolo Q610s is certainly one of the better budget performers which might not be an option of other companies start launching their handsets at such an affordable price tag. Here is how the options pan out in the long run. Design: The handling ability is pretty good as for the latest Q610s which adorns a pretty efficient layout in terms of body to screen ratio. The bezels are pretty narrow which do contribute to the sleekness of the same. 9.3mm may still look like a sizeable number but the gadget feels pretty slim for the dimensions in scope. What stands out is the leather panel which sits pretty at the rear. The texture is pretty elusive whereas the ogling scenario certainly has many takers. The layers are pretty well sought after whereas the keys and important buttons are embedded within without much clutter. Display: To start with the screen response is pretty fast as for the 4.5 inch console which makes use of the IPS technology. Color reproduction is much better as with the given On-Cell Panel whereas the viewing angles are well taken care of. The light transmittance schemes look pretty good whereas minimal reflections are encountered in the longer run. The offered resolution however isn’t the strongest aspect as the 480x854 pixels translate into the pixel density of 218ppi. Multi-touch facilities are added along whereas the 16M color combinations come in handy for the users. Operating Platform: The latest out of the box android operating platform has several admirers. Be it the enhanced performances or the exceptional features in store, the users get the best experience of their lives on adding this platform along. The version is pretty well layered where the app drawer is pretty exhaustive and the navigation bar has several takers. Hardware Specs: With the budget friendly Smartphone like the Q610s, the innards are pretty basic but certainly utilitarian. The MediaTek chipset at MT6582M look pretty convincing whereas the dual-core processor has many takers as well. Both the Cortex A7 cores clock at a sizeable 1.3GHz which is pretty handy for those who are looking to experience better gaming and multitasking performances! One might make use of the Mali 400 MP2 GPU which takes care of the graphical performances as well thus offering better gaming and video playback experiences. Storage: The basics are taken care of as for the Q610s which comes in with 1GB of RAM. This flash memory support goes down well with the processor offered and complements the performances pretty efficiently. One might also look at the internal memory limit which is set at 8GB while a major chunk is still taken up by the OS, thus restricting the user memory. The 32GB limit as with the micro-SD card can now be exploited for extending the internal limit up to something staggering. Camera: Two camera modules even at this price range is certainly a generous option from Xolo. The options however aren’t as strong as some of the other handsets as for the 5MP module which fits into the rear pretty effectively. Offered pixel density is set at 2592x1944 pixels which is pretty significant for the given unit. The major artifacts in LED flashlight and the autofocus specs are included besides the panorama mode and the face detecting spec. Video support is up for grabs at full HD i.e. 1080p whereas the rear camera assumes a VGA like format for clicking out acceptable selfies only. The rear module also supports the Smile and even the Best Shot mode. Battery: The Xolo Q610s involves a pretty average battery for the given price. The 1700mAh unit on offer supports over 8 hours of 3G talk-time besides the web browsing limit of around 4 hours. The latter is meant for 3G whereas over the Wi-Fi network the limit might extend up to around 6 hours.. Video playback limit is close to 5 hours whereas the standby limit for this Li-Ion battery extends up to 377 hours over the 3G network while supporting multiple connectivity features in the form of varied sensors and micro-USB v2.0 support. Conclusion: At such a meager price tag, the Xolo Q610s is certainly one of the better looking gadgets with 3G support added along. While the dual SIM support stands out, the design cues are pretty handy for the users who are inclined towards the aesthetic nuances. Processor is pretty significant whereas the camera modules leave much to be desired.

Specs-wise it is a bit modest - it offers a 4.5" 480 x 854 px display, 1.3 GHz quad core MediaTek processor, coupled with 1 GB RAM, 8 GB native storage and a microSD card slot for added capacity. The camera on the back is a 5 MP one, and on the front the Q610s is equipped with a 0.3 MP selfie shooter.. Dimensions: 5.04 x 2.53 x 0.37 inches (128 x 64.3 x 9.3 mm). Resolution: 480 x 854 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Smile detection, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance..

System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 19.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 17.9 days (430 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 8.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 15.7 days (377 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Features: Album art cover, Background playback.
