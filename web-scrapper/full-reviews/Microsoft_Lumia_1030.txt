Microsoft Lumia 1030 Rumor Roundup: Front Panel Photo With Microsoft, Verizon Logo Emerges. By Pavithra Rathinavel On 07/02/15 AT 6:16 PM. Expansys USA is offering the Microsoft Lumia 640 and Lumia 640 XL at a dirt-cheap price. Nokia’s Lumia 1020 is reportedly being replaced by the Lumia 1030. The Lumia 1020 was one of the stand-out smartphones in the tech industry and was released in 2013. Although it was a huge success back then, there was no successor for a long time, even after Microsoft took over Nokia. Microsoft was reportedly concentrating more on low to mid-range devices than high-end ones. This left a new leak about a possible successor to the Lumia device spreading like wildfire.. According to the usual tipster NWE , a photo pertaining to the Microsoft Lumia 1030 has emerged, confirming the existence of the device. The photo does not give out much information; however, a closer look does reveal two inscriptions near the earpiece and camera holes. One of the inscriptions shows the company name “Microsoft,” while the other one shows the Verizon logo, pointing to the possible carrier choice, notes GSM Arena .. On the other hand, Microsoft is reportedly working on upcoming high-end successors to the Lumia 930 dubbed the Lumia 940 and Lumia 940 XL. A recent leak from a benchmark testing site has reveled key configurations of the Lumia 940 XL. According to GSM Arena , the specifications include a 5.7-inch display, 2,560 x 1,440-pixel QHD screen resolution, a minimum 17-megapixel sensor as the primary unit and 5-megapixel front-facing camera.. The Lumia 940 XL will apparently come equipped with 16 GB of built-in storage space. The phone will house 1.5 GB of RAM configuration. It will also come powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 810 chipset, along with an octa-core processor with ARM's big.LITTLE architecture.. The device is expected to be backed by a 3,300 mAh battery unit. Rumors also suggest that the phone will sport a USB Type-C connector and iris scanner. This Lumia handset will come installed with the new Windows 10 OS. Readers should note that Microsoft has not confirmed the Lumia 940 XL or Lumia 1030 specifications thus far.. Lastly, here is the alleged front panel of the Microsoft Lumia 1030:. #Microsoft 's #Lumia1030 aka #McLaren is finally coming to #Verizon !... ;) http://t.co/dIvFsPL9kq pic.twitter.com/i3sHWViHFc. â€” OnLeaks (@OnLeaks) July 1, 2015.

Will it be sold???? or released??. i have lumia 830 with me. Im still waiting for this model to be release in market this will break all phobes in terms of photography. i can recognize one point with Windows against Android: Windows phones get updates & upgrades in OS twice every month, with android, you buy it with android 6.0 and youre stuck with it.. Android os is better in many ways. if this unit will be released and this 50 mp camera captures good photos and can downloaded with world of tank blitz i will really buy one as fun of lumia units..hope this could be true and released within 2017 year period.. i need it how can i get it. It should be at least 8mp-16mp front while rear Camera is 50mp and Ram should be at least 4g even it's Microsoft. Rom should at least 64gb to 256gb.. pls add zoom level option or zoom power in phone search page. i love my N86 8mp yet. 1 Brand & 1 Phone >>>>>>>>> World Leader NOKIA. I'm really not appreciate with that 50 MP & 2 MP That will be really not desire-able (Need 50mp & 8mp). RAM also need up to 3 to 4 GB.

SONY are you insane ? it's not sony its Microsoft, read. 50mp back camera and front 2mp!!!! SONY are you insane ?. This was my new dream phone.. 1080p display is great but not excessive.

I like each part of the rest of the phone just as much. If I had the money, I would've bought this phone in a heartbeat.. sugam, 18 Aug 2016 50 MP what it mean? photo better than Iphone or note 7 kid , check lumia 930, it was released in 2014 and still samsung and iphone couldn't compete that, and you want to compare 1020 42 M.P or 1030 50 M.P lolz....

Furthermore, the McLaren was supposedly cancelled, which shattered all hopes that Microsoft would offer a Lumia 1030.. The hope for a Lumia 1030 has now been renewed by newly leaked images that show the front panel of a phone that’s believed to be the Lumia 1030.. You can clearly see “Lumia 1030” written on the glass with a marker. This, in itself, is obviously not enough proof that the panel photographed here is indeed for the Lumia 1030, but a trusted source from Nowwhereelse.fr. assures the publication of its validity.. Now let’s move on to the not so obvious. Unless you have super eyesight, you probably didn’t notice the Microsoft logo at the top left of the device. Even more interesting is the Verizon logo at the top right, which means that this phone could be headed to Big Red at a minimum.. We do have to point out that this appears to be only a prototype, and it doesn’t necessarily prove that Microsoft will indeed launch a Lumia 1030 in the future. Assuming the prototype is legit, it only proves the the flagship existed at one point. We aren’t certain how old this prototype is, if the Lumia 1030 is actually in production, or if this is just an old discarded project.. There isn’t a whole lot to go on here, but previous reports pegged the display at 5-inches with a resolution of 1080p (1,920 x 1,080 pixels). The camera will obviously be the center of attention, if it’s a Lumia 1020 update. The camera could push 50-megapixels and would be a worthy upgrade over the 41-megapixel shooter on the Lumia 1020. The only other rumored spec was 2GB of RAM.. The Lumia 1030 could launch later this year, if it is indeed real. It was revealed last December that Microsoft would not release a new flagship phone until September 2015, and instead, concentrate on low-end models in the meantime.. The Lumia 1030 would obviously classify as a flagship, so we will have to wait and see what Microsoft has to offer in a few months. Either way we’ll keep you updated here..

Microsoft Lumia 1030 concept rendered, Windows 10 and 41 MP PureView camera included. posted by Florin T.. Tags :. Windows - Windows + Microsoft - Microsoft +. Last month, we told you that Microsoft was working on a successor to the Lumia 1020 - which is seen by many as the best camera phone to date. While this successor may, or may not be called Lumia 1030, someone in China went ahead and created a Lumia 1030 concept design. The maker of the Lumia 1030 concept envisions it as a high-end Windows 10 smartphone (of course, Windows 10 won’t be out until mid/late 2015, and we hope that a Lumia 1020 successor. will be released earlier than that). This imaginary Lumia 1030 proposes a 5.8-inch display with 1440 x 2560 pixels (Quad HD) - a considerable increase from the 4.5-inch, 768 x 1280 pixels screen of the Lumia 1020. On the back of the 1030 we have a 41 MP PureView camera with LED and Xenon flashes, while the front-facing camera is a 8.7 MP one. Other features: Snapdragon 805 processor, 3 GB of RAM, 32 GB / 64 GB of internal memory, and a generous 4300 mAh battery. The handset doesn’t look too thin, but at least the bezels around the display are kept to a minimum.. Check out the Lumia 1030 concept in the slideshow below (there's even a video at the end) and let us know if you'd like to see something similar from Microsoft.. <iframe height="395" width="640" src="http://player.youku.com/embed/XODE4MjE1MjQ0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>. via: IT home ( translated ), GSM Dome.

(Posts: 256; Member since: 09 Oct 2014). posted on 10 Nov 2014, 19:26. Wow, that actually looks incredible, I would actually buy it if the next phone would actually look like that. The design seems to radical for it to seem plausible.. (Posts: 537; Member since: 10 Sep 2014). posted on 10 Nov 2014, 19:30. They should put dual front-firing speakers or speakers on both ends. The design is so yummy, i want to eat it. I am a fan of Windows phones but I just cant afford one. My budget is for an Android and for an Apple.. (Posts: 398; Member since: 16 Aug 2014). posted on 10 Nov 2014, 19:41. The 520 costs about $100, even better the 822 is cheaper and has an Oled display, 16gb of storage, Carl Zeiss camera, etc. Now I'd never really recommend a WP over a competing android device, but low cost pricing is certainly something in fabor of WP.. (Posts: 3991; Member since: 04 Jan 2012). posted on 10 Nov 2014, 20:34. Technically the 520 is $50 (just picked one up as a spare), and the 530 is the $100 one.

Since it's a cameraphone, it should be easy to operate with one hand, therefore it shouldn't have phablet like dimensions. Moreover there is no bump for camera, which means, that the photo quality, would be only comparable, to what other flagships offer - instead of mind blowing.. (Posts: 1697; Member since: 04 Feb 2011). posted on 10 Nov 2014, 20:05. On the first point, I agree but it doesn't really matter because they're not going to do 5.8" for a 1020 replacement. They'd be smart enough to know that a phone that big would limit appeal. That camera will be saved for what they want to be a popular flagship. On the second point, not necessarily. They could include a sensor of the same size or even bigger in that space; that's the kind of stuff R&D will continue to try to improve on..

I'm all for a successor to the 1020 (especially as a 1020 owner - its my "daily driver") but designing it like the 928 and 930/Icon isn't flattering, and is unpleasant to hold.. (Posts: 1697; Member since: 04 Feb 2011). posted on 10 Nov 2014, 21:59. 928 owner here -- it's actually pretty pleasant to hold because while the edges are flat, the back is rounded.

I am sure there will be another L1020, but I wouldn't take a dime that says this is the actual design. I am starting to think low end phones is all we will get (HTC's M8 for Windows being the exception) until Windows 10 comes out. That is possibly June/July next year? That is a long, long time for 1020, 920, and other flagship WP owners to wait on.. (Posts: 5; Member since: 30 Oct 2013). posted on 11 Nov 2014, 03:56. I like my Lumia 1020 screen size and design more then this stupid concept , it's just a copy of Lumia 830 body design and I don't think this what will be the next Lumia 1030.

> Microsoft > Windows Phone. Redmond has already started work on the Lumia 1020 successor. Reader comments Load old comments. Microsoft Lumia 1030 to Feature 50-Megapixel Camera. Lumia 1030 and 1020 (5 Images). Same sensor manufacturer as for Lumia 930. It could be powered by Windows Phone 10. The first photos showing the Lumia 1030 have already reached the web, but Microsoft still doesn't want to share any details on this particular Windows Phone project.. And still, details that have reached the web in the past 24 hours indicate that Lumia 1030 is going to be a really powerful workhorse coming with an insanely advanced camera that could basically make the phone a pretty good replacement for the average DSLR.. It appears that the Lumia 1030 could come with a 50-megapixel camera, and contrary to what people expected, it might include a Xenon flash. Sources familiar with Microsoft's development plans have indicated that the company is planning to introduce a LED flash instead of a xenon version, but no final decision has been made yet.. Microsoft might look at the same old partners in order to manufacture the camera sensor for the new Windows Phone device, with NPU claiming that Toshiba could again provide the Redmond-based tech giant with a sensor for the Lumia 1030.. Both the Lumia 930 and Lumia 1520 come with sensors created by Toshiba, so the new Lumia 1030 will follow the same steps and come with components provided by previous Microsoft partners.. Lumia 1020 comes with a 41-megapixel camera and Xenon Flash, as well as with a 1.2-megapixel front camera that can be used for taking selfies. The main camera, however, provides a photo resolution of 7152x5368 pixels, thanks to Carl Zeiss optics, optical image stabilization, PureView technology, and a 1/1.5-inch sensor size.. The exact specifications of the Lumia 1030 camera are yet to be disclosed, but more information on this project could be provided next month at CES or soon after that.. Lumia 1030 might be the first Microsoft Lumia phone coming with Windows Phone 10, the next version of Microsoft's smartphone operating system that might debut in 2015.. Not much is known right now about Windows Phone 10, but according to some sources, the company has already taken the new OS out for a spin as it has recently been spotted in server logs in China.. Windows Phone 10 could make its first public appearance in the form of a preview build next month, during a Windows 10 press event, but Microsoft is yet to confirm such plans.. Full information on the January event will be provided before the end of the month, as the same event will also be used by the company to release the very first Windows 10 Consumer Preview build.. # Microsoft # Lumia # Lumia 1030 # Microsoft Lumia.

Breaking Christian News on The Gospel Herald. > Technology > Games And Technology. Microsoft Lumia 1030 and 940, 940 XL Release Date With Windows 10: Rumors Or Real?. Sep 11, 2015 06:01 PM EDT. This might be what the 940 will look like. There have been a lot of rumors about two new Microsoft Lumia phones, the 1030 and 940.. If you go to the Microsoft Mobile Devices site , then you won't find them listed. It will be interesting to see what Microsoft has to compete with the new iPhone 6S, and this is what is known about the Microsoft Lumia 1030 and 940 with Windows 10, and possible Release Date.. According to GSM Arena , they seem to have a full spec sheet, and it will have a Windows 10 operating system.. Unfortunately, the rest of what is listed is just rumored specs such as a 5.0 1080 x 1920 pixel screen, 2 GB of RAM and a 3,000 mAh battery.. What really makes it something is that there are rumors of the Microsoft Lumia 1030 having a huge camera at 50 Megapixels.. That could be some kind of world record, as the Lumia 1020 has about 41 Megapixels, much more than the average camera phone, that is for sure.. Considering that there are doubts whether or not the Lumia 1030 is even real, it would be premature to announce the release date.. Of course, rumored smartphones always seem to have an extraordinary amount of leaked photos, as seen on Digital Trends .. They estimate that the release date will be September 2015, as it was revealed last December that Microsoft would not reveal a new flagship phone until then.. Microsoft Lumia 940 and 940 XL. As for the Microsoft 940 and 940 XL, there seems to be reports that Microsoft will unveil these smartphones at an October 19 th event .. This could also be the same time that the company will unveil their highly anticipated Surface Pro 4, not to mention the new Microsoft Band.. GSM Arena suggests that these devices were originally dubbed the Lumia 950 and 950 XL, but recent reports have apparently changed the numbering scheme.. The Lumia 940 plans on having a 5.2 WQHD (1440 x 2560) OLED display, with the inside being a Snapdragon 808 and 64-bit Hexa core.. It should have about 3GB of RAM, and it will have a 32 GB variant.. As for the cameras, we're looking at a 20 Megapixel PureView on the rear and a 5 Megapixel camera on the front.. The battery will have a 3000 mAh detachable one, and it will also have a USB Type-C charging port as well as Qi wireless charging.. All of this in a matte white look with a black polycarbonate chassis.. As for the Lumia 940 XL it has the same type of OLED display wit 1440 x 2560 resolution, but it will be much larger at 5.7 inches.. The inside will be powered by a Snapdragon 810 with an identical 32 GB storage option and 3 GB of RAM.. It will have the same 20 Megapixels for the rear camera as the Lumia 940, but it will have a triple LED flash.. I'll assuming that the front-facing camera has the same specs at 5 Megapixels.. The battery has a bit more mAh at 3300, and it is removable with the USB Type-C charging port and Qi Wireless charging.. As we head toward September and the October 19 th event, it will be known whether or not these rumors about the Microsoft 1030, 940, and 940 XL are true.. Until then, it is the waiting game, and more leaked photos of these phones will be appearing.. Share this on Facebook (). Duck Dynasty Family Suffers Tragic Loss, Family Member Succumbs to Cancer.

The Microsoft Lumia 1030 is reportedly "dead" - no Lumia 1020 successor this year?. posted by Florin T.. Tags :. Windows - Windows + Microsoft - Microsoft +. Yesterday, we showed you two photos of a front panel that allegedly belongs to the unannounced Microsoft Lumia 1030 (codenamed McLaren) , a handset that should succeed the Nokia Lumia 1020 (which, as you may know, is hailed as one of the best cameraphones to date). While the source of the two photos (French website Nowhereelse) has a good track record when it comes to leaked information, this doesn't necessarily mean the Lumia 1030 will hit the market. In fact, according to Evan Blass (who gained fame as @evleaks by revealing images of many devices before their announcement), the "McLaren is dead", and " Microsoft is finished with the x30 generation." This should mean that the Lumia 630, Lumia 730 and Lumia 930 are the last handsets from the x30 series. Of course, Microsoft already confirmed that it would launch a Windows 10-based flagship smartphone sometime later this year, but this might not be the long-rumored Lumia 1030. Or maybe it will, but it's going to have a different name? We can't know for sure, but we hope we'll find out more about this soon. What do you think, will Microsoft launch a successor to the Lumia 1020 before the end of 2015? P.S.: The device you're seeing above isn't real, it's just a fan-made render.

I wonder if this is an indication that Microsoft is about to throw in the towel. Personally I like Windows Phone but it's obviously isn't going anywhere..

The McLaren has been "dead" for some time now. Just PA looking for more negative publicity surrounding the platform. PA, did nothing in terms of covering MS's E3 showing, even though it blew every other company out of the water....HoloLens, Oculus Rift partnership....etc. But as soon as there is any rumor regarding MS's supposed decision to ditch the platform, or any other negative rumors, they're the first to jump on it. No other tech outlet has such an obvious agenda and bias towards a platform(s). kind of funny and pathetic at the same time.. (Posts: 679; Member since: 23 Apr 2013). posted on 02 Jul 2015, 13:02.

Hating on Microsoft is the "cool" thing to do.. (Posts: 1697; Member since: 04 Feb 2011). posted on 02 Jul 2015, 11:35. McLaren was supposed to be last year and was cancelled last year = old news. 1000 series skipped a release cycle and is therefore likely to be released as the 1040 next time there is a release. Hard to say something that never existed is dead.. (Posts: 3609; Member since: 19 Jan 2011). posted on 02 Jul 2015, 17:31.

That means Microsoft is dead too ........ (Posts: 1216; Member since: 24 Jun 2014). posted on 02 Jul 2015, 11:55. McLaren is not the Lumia 1030, never was. The Lumia 1020 successor is not planned at the moment, but will eventually come out. They would be stupid to kill that phone.. (Posts: 713; Member since: 25 Feb 2013). posted on 02 Jul 2015, 12:09.

But Nokia Promised (lol) a comeback, so why not a Android based On the successor of the 1020. Besidesn the Nokia X1 is awesome. (Posts: 336; Member since: 23 Jan 2010). posted on 02 Jul 2015, 12:29.

I can't believe how so many people get caught up in the insanity of rumors and click-bait articles. (Posts: 3609; Member since: 19 Jan 2011). posted on 02 Jul 2015, 17:29. There is more than enough evidence that Windows 10 mobile is a huge part of MS's plans. I am looking excitedly to the next flagships and the fun improvements..

For marketing's sake with the imminent release of WP10, I wouldn't call it the Lumia 1030 either. Nope, I'd release it simply as the Microsoft Lumia 10.. (Posts: 1587; Member since: 14 Feb 2011). posted on 02 Jul 2015, 17:41. internet sites rumors and speculations are a dime a dozen. Elop and others at Microsoft have already said there will be a Flag ship Microsoft smart phone. they will come it's just a question of when. My guess is the Microsoft Mobile Elite smart phones wont appear til September 2015. they will be able to run Universal apps which will enable them to run any universal app made to run on a Windows 10 desktop, Laptop or windows 10 Tablet computer. there fore Windows 10 mobile smart phones will get new APPS and be the absolute best smart phone to have that will work with windows 10 desktop, Server, Laptop and windows 10 tablets because they can use the same apps the Universal apps.

> Microsoft > Windows Phone. Redmond appears to be developing a new Windows Phone device. Photos of what seems to be the first successor to the Lumia 1020 have reached the web, suggesting that Microsoft is hard at work these days to launch new models that would help expand its Lumia series of phones after dropping the Nokia brand.. There are plenty of unconfirmed details right now, so these pictures coming from Chinese website Tieba could very well be fake, but some of the details they disclose clearly make a lot of sense.. First and foremost, this appears to be the Lumia McLaren, a phone model that was in development at Microsoft earlier this year but which was canceled for unknown reasons.. Lumia McLaren was believed to be one of the most advanced Windows Phone devices on the market, coming with powerful hardware, but also with 3D touch technology which allows users to interact with applications and games without even touching the phone.. Basically, the 3D touch technology relies entirely on sensors and gestures, so users would be allowed to perform a number of tasks, such as answering calls or muting the phone, without pressing dedicated buttons or tapping the screen.. For instance, it was rumored that Lumia McLaren would include options to reject a call by simply waving in front of the display and to zoom photos by simulating pinching the screen in the air.. The leaked Lumia 1030/McLaren photos reveal that the device is codenamed RM-1052 and runs Windows Phone 8.1, although by the time it hits the market, it could very well be updated to Windows Phone 10 if development of the new operating system is completed.. The device also comes with a 1080p display, 2GB of RAM, and 32 GB of storage space, but the overall size of the screen is yet to be disclosed. By the looks of it, this seems to measure at least 5 inches in size, but it could also be increased to 5.7-inches.. As you can see in the photo gallery below, the phone comes with an enormous camera module, so expect it to feature advanced photo and video capabilities. This decision isn't surprising at all, especially because the Lumia 1020 already comes with one of the best cameras on the market: 41 megapixels, photo resolution of 7152x5368 pixels, xenon flash, and autofocus.. What's more surprising is that the device does not feature any Microsoft or Nokia branding on the front or the back, and this could be an indication that it's either a testing unit or just a dummy phone.. As you can see, there are many vague details right now, so take everything with a pinch of salt until Microsoft says a word about this new project.. # Microsoft # Windows Phone # Lumia 1030 # Lumia McLaren # leak.

Microsoft is still busy Microsoft-izing Nokia handsets.. Mind you, people, just previously Lumia 1020 is deemed as the best camera phone.. Still not satisfied with such achievement, the operating system giant is now working on the concept of its prospective big hit—a 1020 successor—which is tentatively named by leak-source as Microsoft Lumia 1030.. It seems that “Lumia 1030” will be under Windows 10 OS. In this case, the smartphone’s estimated release will be later of 2015 or mid-2015 at the latest. Nevertheless, let’s still keep our hopes up for an early treat. It will also be intended as a top-tier handset that will sport an even more epic 41MP PureView primary snapper with an 8.7 MP (or 20MP) secondary shooter.. It looks like that Microsoft is determined to hold the first place for quality-driven camera phones in the world market.. Moreover, Lumia 1030 is planned to be run by a Snapdragon 805 processor partnered by a 3GB of RAM, with a reliable back-up power of 4300 mAh battery.. If these statistics bear facts, the inheritor of Lumia 1020 is a powerhouse, indeed!. Basing from the concept and given specifics, enthusiasts must ready themselves for a high-end pricing as well..

Microsoft Lumia 1030 images leaked online. Camera Design hardware images Leak Microsoft Lumia 1030 Nokia Lumia 1020 2014-11-30. The Microsoft Lumia 1030 smartphone seems to be in the works as revealed by some recently leaked images on the Chinese website Baidu. As its name implies, this device is the successor to the Nokia Lumia 1020, a phone that was quite famous last year thanks to its massive 41 MP camera with Carl Zeiss optics. A huge camera can be seen on its successor as well, although the megapixel count or any other important details are not known at this time.. As for the other specs, the leak reveals that the Microsoft Lumia 1030 will feature an 1920 x 1080 resolution display, 2 GB of RAM, and 32 GB of internal storage memory. The display size has not been mentioned, but we assume it will at least be a bit bigger than the 4.5-inch panel found on the Nokia Lumia 1020.. The rest of the hardware is still a mystery for now but at least we know quite a bit about the design thanks to the leak. Judging by the pictures, the Microsoft Lumia 1030 will feature an aluminum body, a dedicated camera button the on side, and a headphone jack input on the top. Interestingly, the Microsoft branding is nowhere to be seen on the smartphone, which is a little strange to say the least. The company has started replacing the Nokia name with their own and the first phone with the new branding has already been released in the form of the Microsoft Lumia 535. it’s worth pointing out that the Lumia 1030 seen in the images is just a prototype, so the brand may indeed appear on the final version of the device.. The images also show that the phone has the codename RM-1052 and is running on Windows Phone 8.1 build. Aside from all of this, there are no other major details to discuss at this time I’m afraid. The camera is likely to be the main selling point on the Microsoft Lumia 1030 just as it was on its predecessor, so let’s hope that we’ll be able to learn some more details about.

Breaking Christian News on The Gospel Herald. > Technology > Games And Technology. Microsoft Lumia 1030, 950, and 950XL Release Date: Microsoft October 6th Event Coming Up. Oct 02, 2015 03:06 PM EDT. Now that Windows 10 had been made available, it should really be on the Lumia brand of smartphones.. Fortunately, this is going to happen soon as two new phones, the Microsoft Lumia 950 and 950 XL are sure to come with Windows 10 out of the box.. The release date for these smartphones is happening soon, as well as the possible release of the Microsoft Lumia 1030.. According to PC Advisor , there was a leak at Microsoft itself that brought details about these first Windows 10 phones.. It is believed that these phones will be prominently announced at a big event that is taking place on the 6 th of October.. It was also announced that these phones would have a different numbering system with 940 and 940 XL, and they have been also known by codenames of Talkman and Cityman.. The Lumia 950 plans on having a 5.2 WQHD (1440 x 2560) OLED display, with the inside being a Snapdragon 808 and 64-bit Hexa core.. It should have about 3GB of RAM, and it will have a 32 GB variant.. As for the cameras, we're looking at a 20 Megapixel PureView with Zeiss optics on the rear and a 5 Megapixel camera on the front.. The battery will have a 3000 mAh detachable one, and it will also have a USB Type-C charging port as well as Qi wireless charging.. All of this in a matte white look with a black polycarbonate chassis.. As for the Lumia 950 XL it has the same type of OLED display with 1440 x 2560 resolution, but it will be much larger at 5.7 inches.. The inside will be powered by a Snapdragon 810 with an identical 32 GB storage option and 3 GB of RAM.. It will have the same 20 Megapixels for the rear camera as the Lumia 940, but it will have a triple LED flash.. We'll assume that the front-facing camera has the same specs at 5 Megapixels.. The battery has a bit more mAh at 3300, and it is removable with the USB Type-C charging port and Qi Wireless charging.. As for news about the Microsoft Lumia 1030, news of this has been very scarce recently.. Much of what can be found online matches what was suspected about it a month ago.. According to GSM Arena , they seem to have a full spec sheet, and it will have a Windows 10 operating system.. Unfortunately, the rest of what is listed is just rumored specs such as a 5.0 1080 x 1920 pixel screen, 2 GB of RAM and a 3,000 mAh battery.. What really makes it something is that there are rumors of the Microsoft Lumia 1030 having a huge camera at 50 Megapixels.. That could be some kind of world record, as the Lumia 1020 has about 41 Megapixels, much more than the average camera phone, that is for sure.. Considering that there are doubts whether or not the Lumia 1030 is even real, it would be premature to announce the release date. Perhaps more will be announced on the phone at the October 6th big event.. Share this on Facebook (). Duck Dynasty Family Suffers Tragic Loss, Family Member Succumbs to Cancer.
