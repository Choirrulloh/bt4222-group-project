A small update to the Moto G5, with better cameras and a bigger screen. SHOULD I BUY MOTOROLA MOTO G5S?. The Moto G5 wasn’t perfect, and the G5s improves upon it – except for performance. A small update to the Moto G5, with better cameras and a bigger screen. Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices. When the Moto G5 launched it became our favourite budget phone, but things weren’t perfect. It was no faster than the outgoing G4 and – if anything – battery life was marginally worse.. Motorola followed up with the G5s, which in 2018 faces stiff competition from plenty of other inexpensive phones – notably those from China.. and it’s available in Fine Gold or Lunar Grey.. In the US, you can buy a G5s for $249.99 from Motorola in the same colours.. That’s the single-SIM version with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. It’s expandable via a microSD card up to 256GB.. There are dual-SIM versions of the G5s, but they’re not widely available in the UK and in any case, they use a hybrid tray which forces you to choose between using a microSD card or a second SIM.. Compared to the many ‘bezel-less’ phones around these days, the G5s looks dated with its large top and bottom bezels. However, with an all-aluminium chassis, it feels well built. And at 154g, it isn’t too heavy.. Even though Motorola has installed a slightly bigger screen, 5.2in up from 5in in the G5, the phone itself is barely any smaller than rivals with a 6in screen.. That said, it’s a decent 1080p screen which is nice and bright and has decent contrast and colours. As it’s larger than the G5’s screen, pixel density is a bit lower but at 423ppi everything still looks lovely and sharp. It’s covered in Gorilla Glass 3, unlike the G5 which had no Gorilla Glass at all.. You don’t get a whole lot of great specifications for your money, though. There’s no 802.11ac Wi-Fi, no USB-C port and – worst of all – the same old Snapdragon 430 processor which we criticised in the G5.. The ‘s’ does have upgrades beyond the bigger screen though. It has NFC, so you can use it with Android Pay, and there are better cameras both front and rear. You also get Bluetooth 4.2 with aptX support and in the box is a TurboPower fast charger, too.. The fingerprint scanner is on the front, as before, and doubles as a navigation button if you enable the option. It’s worth saying, too, that although there’s no 802.11ac, you still get dual-band 802.11n, which means the G5s can connect to the faster 5GHz radio on a compatible wireless router.. And talking of radios, there’s an FM radio which is unusual to see in a UK phone. You can read our detailed Moto G5 vs G5s comparison , too.. The main problem with phone is that processor. Motorola calls it a ‘blazing-fast 1.4GHz octa-core’ but this isn’t remotely true. It’s an oxymoron: the latest chips run around 1GHz faster than this.. Clock speed isn’t the best indicator of performance, but our benchmarks (not that we needed them) confirmed that the G5s is just as sluggish as its predecessor.. In Geekbench 4, it scored only 2099, and that's the multicore score. For context, the Maze Alpha (£146) scored 3642.. Even with no additional apps installed it’s easy to notice the occasional hesitation when switching between apps and simply navigating around Android.. Put simply, performance is below the level we’d expect from a £200 phone and there are faster alternatives available for less money.. The same goes for 3D grunt: the G5s can handle casual games, but you’ll notice a reduction in graphics quality on more demanding games, which won’t run as smoothly as on more powerful phones.. In GFXBench it managed 14fps in the basic T-Rex test and only 7.5fps in the Manhattan test. The newest Car Chase test played like a photo slideshow.. Battery life is marginally better than the G5 thanks to the bigger-capacity 3000mAh cell, but you’ll still be charging the G5s each night so, practically, there’s no real difference.. The benefit is the TurboPower charging which will give the phone around five hours of use from a 15-minute charge.. This is where the real improvements show. The front camera unfortunately still has only a 5mp sensor, but the f/2.0 lens delivers sharper, slightly better selfies than before.. It’s at the back where there’s a noticeable jump in quality. It isn’t really because of the switch from 13- to 16Mp sensors: resolution is never a good indicator of quality. Regardless, the G5s is capable of taking much better photos than the G5.. In good light, pictures are sharp with lots of detail and great colours. We also like that there’s an auto HDR mode rather than having to select it manually, which is an inconvenience that means it rarely gets used.. On the G5s, automatic HDR is enabled by default and when invoked it does a decent job of improving high-contrast shots.. Things aren't as rosy in low light where much noise creeps in and the camera just can't resolve the level of detail you get from flagship phones.. The bad news for those who like to shoot video is that the CPU limits resolution and framerate to 1920x1080 and 30fps respectively.. It does benefit from software stabilisation, though, which does smooth out a lot of unwanted movement from shaky hands.. Since launch, Motorola has updated Android to 7.1.1, but there’s still no Oreo available even though the firm did promise to roll out Android 8.0 to the phone.. The good news is that – as ever – the Moto G5s runs a near-stock version of Android with actually useful additions from Motorola. You get the double-twist to launch the camera, karate chop for torch, plus the option to use gestures on the fingerprint scanner instead of the standard Android navigation buttons.. Again, the ability to flip the phone onto its screen to put it in ‘do not disturb’ mode is really handy.. Compared to other Moto phones, there’s a limited selection of Moto Display options. No double-tap to wake the phone, nor swipe your hand over the screen to see notifications. You can enable ‘fade in and out’ notifications when the screen is off and a blue-light reduction at night, but these are pretty standard on most Android phones.. Those who love their Android notification LED will be disappointed that, although there is one for indicating low battery and charging, it cannot be used as for notifications.. 32GB with microSD slot (up to 128GB). 16Mp, LED flash, 1080p video at 30fps. 32GB with microSD slot (up to 128GB). 16Mp, LED flash, 1080p video at 30fps. The G5s is a good-looking, well-built phone that suffers from below-average performance. Its cameras are good, though, and it has a decent screen.. The main problem is that you can get a faster phone with better specs for the same money, so it’s hard to recommend it unless you find it significantly cheaper..

Florian Wimmer ( translated by Richard Schultheis), 12/10/2017. Android ARM Smartphone Touchscreen. The special edition of the Moto G5 is intended to add to Motorola's selection of mid-range smartphones, and there have been a number of changes to make that happen. Most notably, the camera has been significantly enhanced. In our review, we will ascertain whether this will prove a marked improvement in everyday use..

By now, Motorola's G-series smartphones have firmly established their position in the mid-range market. The respective generation is indicated simply by adding its number to the series name. has been available for a while now, and Motorola, or its parent company Lenovo, has made the decision to offer a special edition of the phone by adding an 's' to its name, hence our test unit's designation, Motorola Moto G5s. In order to avoid any confusions, the manufacturer has printed 'Special Edition' on the unit's packaging. The G5s appears to be a stopgap before the Moto G6 hits the market, and consequently, not much has changed about the mid-range mix that made the G5 a successful product - it retains its comfortably rounded metal case and, apart from the differently positioned microphone and slightly protruding camera, it can barely be distinguished from the 'normal' edition.. The main camera now comes with a higher resolution sensor, the storage has been increased and the battery holds more power, although it is no longer removable in this iteration. These are the most marked differences of the special edition, which has an SRP of â¬249 (~$293). but is already available for under â¬200 (~$235). can be ordered for about â¬150 (~176$). Is the G5s worth the premium and can the unconventional design still hold its own? We will find out in this review.. To answer these questions, we compare the Moto G5s not only with its predecessor, but other fairly affordable. to the field and will ascertain whether the extra â¬80 (~94$) makes a noticeable difference..

As mentioned above, Motorola has changed the smartphone's case. marginally: its metal case is still available in the colors gray and gold and its edges are well rounded, as is typical of the brand. The design generally keeps to the organic forms and avoids angular shapes. The slightly inlaid Motorola logo on the back that also serves as a finger rest is still there. Since the phone's battery is now built-in, the back cover is now a one-piece construction. As with the G5, the special edition's overall build quality is remarkable, especially for a mid-range device.. The screen's size has grown slightly to 5.2 inches, although the change in the smartphone's dimensions is limited to the length. Its weight, on the other hand, has increased to a hefty 157 grams (~5.5 oz), making the Moto G5s one of the heaviest competitors in its class.. Motorola Moto G5s full resolution.

The good news is that memory size has been increased in the Motorola Moto G5s compared to its predecessor - the G5s has 32 GB, while its RAM remains at 3 GB. Storage capacity can be increased using the microSD card slot. The microSD card takes up one of the two SIM slots in the dual-SIM version that we were supplied with. The Moto G5s can format microSD cards into external and internal memory and the cards can be inserted and ejected while the device is running. Apps can only be transferred to microSD cards that have been formatted as internal memory.. The Moto G5s retains its micro-USB port and still only. supports data transfer with USB 2.0 speeds. In return, the device is USB OTG enabled and has a 3.5 mm audio jack that no longer comes as standard with many of the latest models.. bottom: speaker, micro USB port, microphone. Motorola continues to supply a fairly unmodified Android 7.1.1 and has confirmed Android 8 support for the device. Fortunately, bloatware and advertising apps are few on Moto-smartphones: only LinkedIn and Outlook come preinstalled.. Other than that, Motorola has changed the stock Android 7.1.1. only very slightly by installing its own Moto App: This app has several features, one of them a blue light filter. The Moto App also has an option to display notifications on the smartphone's turned off screen, called Moto Display and another option that makes it possible to use various gesture and movement-controlled commands, called Moto Action.. WLAN speeds remain average: the Moto G5s supports wireless networks of the types. Therefore, one could use the less overpopulated 5 GHz WLAN network. Considering its hardware capabilities, the Moto G5s achieves commendable networking speeds, but those who want to use the faster 802.11ac standard will be better served by some of the Moto G5s' direct competitors,. Like its predecessor, the Moto G5s has better than average support for mobile bands among its class: LTE speeds of up to 150 Mbit/s download are standard.. The smartphone's support for ten mobile bands makes it usable abroad and its reception quality is very decent â we tested logging into the well-developed German Vodafone network in the city and consistently noted at least Â¾ of the total LTE signal strength even indoors..

Indoors, we could not achieve a satellite fix, even in the proximity of windows. Outdoors however, we achieved a quick satellite fix to a precision of 6 meters (~20 ft).. To test the Moto G5s' GPS capabilities in everyday use, we took it on a mountain bike ride along with our Garmin Edge 500, a professional-grade bike computer. The recorded distances diverge by only 10 meters (~33 ft), which is an excellent result. At various points on the route, the Moto G5s' recorded track was closer to the actual position than the Garmin computer's, while at others clear course deviations that are obvious inaccuracies. The overall GPS quality, however, is very decent for a smartphone this affordable and one would be right to put their trust in its accuracy, even when exploring unknown terrain..

GPS Motorola Moto G5s â bridge. Consistent with Motorola's principle of delivering an Android experience as unadulterated as possible, the Moto G5s uses Google's standard call app. This app is very intuitive and therefore a. The G5s' call quality is similar to that of the. Moto G5 : the earphone delivers good voice quality, up to very loud volumes. By comparison, the microphone was less impressive, transmitting the speaker's voice with interference, albeit always in an intelligible quality. In handsfree mode, call quality remains decent, but the speaker needs to be in close proximity of the phone and not speak too quietly for the microphone to pick up their voice.. The camera is surely the most exciting part of this update, since it is supposed to be the main upgrade in the Moto G5s. While the main camera does not have dual lenses like the. its sensor has a higher resolution, and the front camera now has a higher aperture lens.. The main camera has a new 16 MP sensor, still with phase detection autofocus and its monochromatic LED flash. The recorded photos seem rather cool and the colors are significantly less bright than on, for example, the. Other smartphones also have a better automatic brightness correction. In higher zoom levels, blur and pixelation is a real problem, especially compared to high-level smartphone cameras such as the one on the. Galaxy Note 8 , although the significant price difference must be taken into account. Compared to other phones in its class, the Moto G5s takes decent photos that are on the dark side. Those using their smartphone camera as a point-and-shoot and usually only look at the results on the phone itself, will be satisfied with the Moto G5s. But for those who already own a. Moto G5 , the improvements in photo quality will not be sufficient to consider an upgrade. One interesting point is that the new sensor handles brightness correction in low-light scenes better than its predecessor, while in turn, normal light conditions produce slightly somber shots.. Videos can be recorded with up to 1080p at 30 FPS. The sensor reacts to changing light conditions swiftly and appropriately, picture clarity and color precision are also decent. Here as well, the video brightness could be improved on, but the overall impression of the Moto G5s' video function is still good.. On the front camera, the new sensor has the same resolution as that of the Moto G5: 5 MP, although its aperture is now wider, which may make it handle low-light scenes better. As it happens, photos taken in adverse lighting conditions turn out respectably well, even without a flash. The picture quality of shots taken in bright conditions was also satisfactory; colors are vivid and realistic, and even zoomed shots have good sharpness and details.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. The Moto G5s also had to prove its worth under controlled light conditions. Our test photo appears sharp and color transitions as well as lettering on colorful backgrounds are reproduced accurately. At higher zoom levels, edges show minor image noise and artifacts. Some colored areas appear unclear, but color precision is good on balance.. Lens and camera testing chart detail. ColorChecker: target colour is displayed in the lower half of each colour square. As well as the smartphone, the box contains a Quick Charge adapter, a USB cable and a SIM-card tool. Additional chargers can be bought from Motorola directly on its. Unfortunately, the possibility of customizing one's smartphone with the Motomaker before buying it has not been available for a while.. In central Europe Motorola offers 24 months of warranty for its smartphones.. Googles GBoard is used as the device's virtual keyboard and offers good handling and various possibilities for customization. Alternative apps can always be downloaded from the Google Play Store or other sources.. The menu keys are on the display by default, but can be disabled so that the system is operated only by touch, gestures and input through the fingerprint sensor. After a short period of familiarization, this works quite well and is a valid option for those who need more space on the display. This option, like many other touch and gesture input options, is available through the Moto app.. For instance, there is an option to start the camera app by quickly twisting the phone twice, or another to enable a Do-Not-Disturb-mode by laying it display-down on a surface. All gestures can be activated individually and work reliably.. The touchscreen is sensitive on its entire surface and handles touch inputs precisely.. Moto G5 , the Moto G5s' display has increased marginally: it now has a diagonal of 5.2 inches, still a Full HD and with IPS technology. However, its maximum brightness is considerably lower than on its predecessor and many comparable devices. has a darker screen, which, however, has AMOLED technology.. The Moto G5s' screen averages at around 502 cd/mÂ², which is not bad, but below what other mid-range devices achieve. With the lowest intensity levels at about 92% of the maximum brightness measured, the display strikes us as accurate, so that even larger areas are displayed without obvious brightness variation.. 501 cd/m² 521 cd/m² 524 cd/m² 481 cd/m² 490 cd/m² 510 cd/m² 490 cd/m² 483 cd/m² 520 cd/m². 92 % Center on Battery: 490. cd/m²) ΔE Color 5.7 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 4.7 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.4.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM detected 2358 Hz 6. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. The display backlight flickers at 2358. Hz (Likely utilizing PWM) Flickering detected at a brightness setting of 6. There should be no flickering or PWM above this brightness setting.. Hz is quite high, so most users sensitive to PWM should not notice any flickering.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. At 0.43 cd/mÂ², the new display's black levels are significantly higher than that on the predecessor's, which together with the lower brightness produce clearly worse contrast levels of 1140:1. On its own, this is not a poor result by any means and most competing smartphones offer similar display characteristics. In short, the Moto G5s lags behind its predecessor's vivid and bold portrayal of colors, but achieves a quite natural display of colors in its own right.. In the display settings, the user can switch between 'Standard' and 'Intense' color modes, which make a subjective difference, but not a large one. Despite this impression, we measured the modes with our spectrophotometer and the software CalMAN. Our findings confirm that the two options change the display of images only slightly: in the 'Standard' mode, colors seem a little more natural, while the 'Intense' mode's portrayal of the grayscale is closer to RGB reference levels. In both modes, we found the image to have a distinct blue shift, which can be mitigated with the Moto mod's blue light filter that increases red levels in the white balance and makes looking at the display more pleasant, especially at night.. In the Moto G5s' predecessor, we noted screen flickering below certain brightness levels and could observe the same issue with the Moto G5s. All the same, this flickering's frequency is high enough that even those sensitive to screen flickering should not be troubled by it..

In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.9 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is worse than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. The predecessor coped with outdoor applications better due to its brighter display, but the Moto G5s still does decently well on all but the sunniest of days. Its ambient light sensor works reliably, contrast levels are sufficient and, having retreated into the shade, the display is quite usable.. The IPS displayâs viewing angles are flawless: the image can be seen clearly from all angles.. Outdoor use â ambient light sensor. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

Unfortunately, the app 'GameBench' failed to launch on our test unit, so we could not provide any frame rate counts for the tested games. Since the relevant hardware for game performance has not changed compared to the predecessor's and noting that the Moto G5s performs very similarly in other benchmarks, it seems reasonable to consult our findings in the review of the. In any event, in gameplay we found that the highest graphics options of â Asphalt 8 â produce slight jitters, but slightly lowered settings result in smooth gameplay. Other games such as â Dead Trigger 2 â or less demanding ones such as â Angry Birds â are rendered smoothly.. The Moto G5s' touchscreen controls and handling as well as its position sensors were entirely satisfactory.. The maximum temperatures measured under load on the case itself amounted to 36 Â°C (~97 Â°F). This warming is noticeable, but not critical by any means. As with the predecessor, the highest temperatures were measured in the earphone area, which can make calls uncomfortable on hot summer days. In general, the temperatures are fairly even across the case and are significantly lower while idling.. With the benchmark GFXBench and its included battery test, we could ascertain that the frame rates remained consistent even after 30 benchmark cycles. Accordingly, any throttling of the hardware components under prolonged load seems unlikely.. 36 °C 33.4 °C 32.6 °C. 34.3 °C 33.7 °C 31.6 °C. 34.9 °C 32.5 °C 31.4 °C.

Moto G5 , the speaker was positioned within the earphone, which was satisfactory, and now, on the new Moto G5s, Motorola has adopted a more usual layout, positioning the speaker at the case's bottom. In exchange, the speaker now has decidedly more power with an intensity of more than 88 dB(A). Our test software ARTA also found that it has greater variety in the lower mids and even more so in the highs. We were satisfied with the low mids, but the highs are overemphasized now. This impacts the overall sound performance negatively, since the core bass range is hardly perceptible now. On the whole, the Moto G5s' speaker is better than what the competing devices offer, and above all, much louder, but it could have used some more fine-tuning. To improve on the sound balance, one would need to find an equalizer app on the Google Play Store, since no such app is preinstalled.. The sound is played cleanly over the 3.5 mm audio jack and Bluetooth.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 35.2 43.3 25 32.9 46.6 31 37.2 36.8 40 31.7 35.5 50 39.6 42.1 63 28.3 38 80 27.3 36.8 100 26.9 34.2 125 26.7 37.9 160 24 41.8 200 20.9 46 250 20.9 51.1 315 19.5 56.3 400 18.5 59.8 500 17.5 64.2 630 17.5 69 800 15.7 74.2 1000 15.8 75.8 1250 16.6 73.6 1600 15.8 69 2000 15.4 71.4 2500 15.5 71 3150 16 77.6 4000 15.8 79.7 5000 16 79.9 6300 16.3 76.2 8000 16.3 74.4 10000 16.2 82.4 12500 16.4 80.8 16000 16.4 62.2 SPL 28.6 88.4 N 1.1 73.5 median 16.4 Motorola Moto G5s median 71 Delta 2.1 9.8 31.6 36.6 25.4 36.2 25.3 35.8 32.9 27.8 33.6 27.6 31.6 30.3 28.4 30.3 27 27.8 20.8 32.9 22 32 21.3 39.6 20.8 45.5 21.2 52.8 19.4 57.3 19.5 64.9 17.7 69.4 17.9 69.8 17.8 73.2 17.3 72.1 17.4 70.2 16.7 70.7 17.2 72.5 18.2 71.8 17.9 69.8 17.6 69.6 17.7 65.7 17.8 64 17.9 64.3 18.1 57.5 18.2 51.3 30 82.1 1.3 51.5 median 17.9 Lenovo Moto G5 median 64.9 1.3 10.8 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Frequency diagram in comparison (checkboxes above selectable/deselectable!). Once the Moto G5s is turned off, it draws almost no power, which will be useful for those who like to turn off their smartphones once in a while and just leave them for a time; even after several weeks the battery level should be about the same as before.. Once it is turned on, and used moderately, the Motorola Moto G5s draws power sparingly: 1.52 watts while idling is decent. When it is taxed, however, its power consumption jumps to relatively high levels, using more power than all the competing devices with 7.05 watts at maximum load..

Test unit supplied by Motorola Germany.. The Moto G5s is a successful evolution of its predecessor and has changed less than appears at first glance: more memory, improved camera, larger screen and a new speaker. Furthermore, the new camera sensors perform very decently: photos taken with the main camera are on the cool side, but the sensor corrects adverse lighting conditions well. The front camera confirms these findings.. The smartphone has no serious faults: its screen is darker than its predecessor's and its power consumption is slightly too high. Moreover, the respectable speaker has to be fine-tuned with an equalizer to correct the overemphasised highs. The microphone is also rather mediocre. In return, the software runs smoothly and comes without bloatware. The device remains cool as well.. Even with the larger battery, battery life has not improved and, all things considered, an upgrade from the Moto G5 is not worth it. If you are, however, deciding between getting the G5 and the G5s, it depends on how important the removable battery of the G5 is to you. Otherwise, picking the G5s is surely a good call, since it comes with more memory and an improved camera. The G5s Plus comes with a dual camera that does not constitute a drastic advantage, although the markedly faster CPU and GPU could justify the price difference.. The Motorola Moto G5s is a successful intermediate product that does not offer revolutionary innovation. Rather, it comes with improvements of some details, but one or the other change for the worse as well: its display, for instance, is darker than its predecessor's. All things considered, the Moto G5s appears to be a well-balanced deal that finds its place in the lower mid-range.. Overall, the Moto G5s has earned its place in the Moto G-series family and can hold its own against similarly priced smartphones of other manufacturers..

G5S Plus XT1806 64GB Smartphone (Unlocked, Lunar Gray) Reviews - page 2 cuzbvxyzerydrwazytwwfccebyrswvaa. G5S Plus XT1806 64GB Smartphone (Unlocked, Lunar Gray) is rated. Rated 4 out of. Very nice phone, but not perfect. All works well, with some minor faults. Case is nice, but slick, so can slip easily on a non-level surface; a skin helps. My biggest complaint is notifications: There is no blinking light while the screen is off. Rather than that, the screen briefly comes on when the phone is lifted or bumped, showing the notifications. It's nice that they can be seen without fully waking the phone (by touching the screen), but not so nice that I can't just glance at the phone across the room to see a flashing light. Also, if the phone is not perfectly still, the screen keeps coming on, which has to use some battery power.. Rated 5 out of. Coming from the Nexus 6 (also by Motorola), I knew I would be giving up a few features (wireless charging, NFC) but considering all this phone has and the design, the performance/price ratio is hard to beat. The screen size/quality is perfect, the metal body gives it a premium feel (similar to HTC One series), and the clutter-free Android OS is close enough to pure Android to please most Nexus users. My only disappointment is the lack of NFC for Android Pay, even though I didn't use it much on my Nexus 6. It's simply not a shortcut any manufacturer should be taking right now, but still it did not affect my decision to give this one a shot and I'm very glad that I did. With the micro SD slot, the 64GB option is really only for those who want the jump from 3GB to 4GB of RAM. The downfiring speaker is very loud with impressive clarity, although completely lacking any depth (bass). I'd recommend dropping $50 on a decent Bluetooth speaker or earbuds for music listening. Overall, this is a budget smartphone with nearly all of the features and quality of flagship phones more than 2-3x the price.. Rated 5 out of. After leaving Windows 10 mobile which I really loved. Too bad Microsoft gave up and most did not even bother to try. I was looking at getting back to android without breaking the wallet. I originally bought the Nokia 6 but the 430 CPU was just too slow for me and returned the phone. I read all the reviews regarding the Moto G5 Plus then I came across the G5s Plus. This is a really great phone for under $300. The 625 CPU is plenty fast almost flagship performance along with having dual lens. Not many phones have this feature for under $300 in 2017. One of the best Android phones for under $300. Phones like this shows that there is no reason to spend $600 + on a smart phone. Rated 5 out of. Moto G5S Plus XT1806 64GB- Excellent sub $300 phone. I would have given 4.5 stars if that was an option.� I replaced a Moto G4 Plus.� The G5S Plus is nearly identical size but is noticeably better.� It is noticeably faster at opening apps and loading websites.� Plus it has a slightly better camera.� Overall I really like this phone and for under $300 it is maybe the best value (android) out there as of fall 2017.� It definitely compares well to slightly more expensive phones.. I don't love the fact that they swapped the location of the power button and the volume buttons.� I keep hitting the power button when I am trying to adjust volume.� I am sure I will adjust though.. I do wish I could find an android as capable as this phone more in the 4.5 inch screen size range but that is just preference.. Rated 5 out of. Hello i want to know if this modo has dual sim????thanks. Rated 5 out of. Great phone without paying flagship prices.� Almost pure Android with no bloatware, only two apps Moto adds with helpful setup info. I miss the blinking notification light, but I can live without it.� I easily activated it with Straight Talk on Verizon towers.� Bright clear display and I say that coming from an amoled screen.� No nfc, be aware of that if you need it.. Rated 4 out of. It arrived to my city in Peru even before the deadline; very well packed and new. The reason I give only 4 stars is that I wasn't informed about all the taxes I had to pay (almost 40% of the price). I know it was also my responsability to know about this, but when I asked the costumer service about how much extra I need to pay in order to have it in my country, they didn't say a word about paying taxes, so I can ask about that before buying it.. Once more, excellent product, but my complaint is the 40% of taxes I had to pay.. Rated 3 out of. I pre ordered from Moto right when it came out. Largely a balanced experience with good software implementation. But-- there are fairly well documented issues with WiFi connectivity. It's unreliable and affects notifications and wifi calling. Mine has started flaking out after three months. Be the first to review this item. See any errors on this page?. Please enable javascript for your best B&H experience..

Motorola Moto G5S review: A sharper take on the Moto G5. A decent upgrade on the Moto G5, with a nice redesign and an excellent camera You are here: Home Mobile phones Motorola Moto G5S review: A sharper take on the Moto G5. whatsapp facebook twitter google+ linkedin reddit email. Motorola G5S review: Design and feel Motorola G5S review: Display Motorola Moto G5S review: Performance and battery life Motorola Moto G5S review: Camera Motorola Moto GGS review: Verdict. Motorola’s budget Moto G5 smartphone, released earlier this year, was a decent Android handset, but it suffered from an iffy camera, performance was no better than the older Moto G4 and battery life was actually slightly worse.. Perhaps that’s why the manufacturer has quickly followed it up with the Moto G5S, which has an upgraded design, a bigger battery and an improved camera. Look closely and you might notice that the screen size has been bumped up slightly too, from 5in to 5.2in. No doubt, it’s a step up from the old G5.. READ NEXT: Motorola Moto G5 review – the King is dead. Motorola Moto G5S 32 GB (Single Sim) UK SIM-Free Smartphone - Lunar Grey. The Moto G5S doesn’t just look classier than its predecessor: it feels more like a premium phone with an all-metal unibody design in place of the G5’s aluminium rear panel. It’s sadly not dust or water resistant, but chamfered edges add to the upmarket impression, and the indented Motorola logo on the rear cleverly serves as a finger-hold that makes the phone easier to grip and use one-handed.. Moto G5 review: The king is dead. Best smartphone deals in the UK 2017: The best Galaxy S7, iPhone 6s and Nexus 6P deals in the UK. Moto G5 Plus review: Everything the Moto G5 should have been (with an incredible camera). The fingerprint-reader remains at the front, below the screen, serving double duty as a Home button. I found it worked unerringly, reliably identifying me in the blink of an eye.. There’s a decent set of options for connectivity and expansion too. The standard 32GB of internal storage is enough for a decent-sized collection of apps and music, but if you want more there’s a spare slot in the nano-SIM tray that will take a microSD card of up to 256GB. Alternatively, you can insert a second SIM for convenient international calling, but since there’s only the one slot it’s an either/or situation.. At the bottom of the phone sits the familiar micro-USB socket for charging and data transfer, at the top there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack for those who still prefer wired headphones, but Bluetooth fans haven’t been forgotten: there’s built-in aptX support for high-quality wireless streaming, which isn’t something you can take for granted on a budget phone. It would have been nice to see 802.11ac wireless too, but dual-band 802.11n should keep things speedy enough.. As I’ve mentioned, the G5S has a very slightly bigger screen than the G5. It has the same Full HD resolution, however, so the pixel density is a touch lower. You don’t need to worry about blocky text, though, as it still works out to a perfectly crisp 423ppi.. Its backlight hit a super-bright peak of 500cd/m² in our tests, with a rock-solid contrast ratio of 1,708:1, so it’s easy to read and browse even under all but the brightest sunlight. And with an 80.4% sRGB colour gamut coverage, the G5S’s IPS screen does a decent job of colour reproduction as well.. My only quibble is that, as is common with low-cost phones, the colours aren’t perfectly accurate. We measured an average Delta E of 3.48, with a maximum of 8.47; in practice that means the most vibrant colours can look a little washed out. It’s a shame, but not a deal-breaker.. We’ve long appreciated Motorola’s restraint when it comes to customising Android, and the G5S runs something that looks pleasingly similar to a stock installation of Android 7.1 (Nougat). The manufacturer’s light touch also smooths the path for updates, with an upgrade to Android 8 (Oreo) promised in the coming months.. Sadly, while the OS may be up to speed, the same can’t be said for the internals. The Moto G5S uses the same 1.4GHz quad-core Snapdragon 430 processor as the Moto G5, a chip that’s now getting on for two years old, and partners it with a merely adequate 3GB of RAM.. As a result, when it comes to app performance, there’s very little to choose between this and its budget rivals, including Motorola’s own G5 and even the older G4.. It’s a similar story with gaming. In the GFXBench Manhattan 3.0 benchmark the G5S merely kept pace with low-cost handsets that have been knocking around for months and years.. And if you were hoping that battery life at least would receive a boost, prepare to be disappointed. The G5S’ battery is bigger than the original Moto G5’s, but we’re only talking about an uplift from 2,800mAh to 3,000mAh. In our tests that translated to just an extra 21 minutes of use, for a total of 12hrs 12mins in our video rundown benchmark. It’s a far cry from the (sadly discontinued) Lenovo P2, which kept going for 28hrs 50mins in the same test.. While raw performance might be lacking, there’s good news for the snap-happy: the camera on the G5S is a big improvement on what went before. On paper, not much might seem to have changed: the pixel count is up from the G5’s 13 megapixels to 16 megapixels, but the phase-detect autofocus and f/2.0 aperture are unchanged.. The results, however, speak for themselves. In favourable lighting conditions, the G5S does a magnificent job of producing well balanced, vibrant exposures. In the shot below (taken with HDR disabled) there’s a good degree of solid definition in the brickwork in the foreground, yet the sky and highlights aren’t oversaturated or blown out either.. Turning HDR (see below) on adds even more zing to the photo: the trees and buildings spring to life, while crisp details emerge from the murky lowlights. It’s seriously impressive: we’re not sure we’ve seen better daylight camera performance from any smartphone in this price bracket.. Predictably, the sensor doesn’t do quite so well in low light. With the flash disabled, colours look more subdued and you don’t have to look too closely to spot smeary noise.. Enable the flash and the noise vanishes, but now there’s a distinct yellow tint. It’s not too offensive but, having seen what the camera can do in natural light, I had hoped it would be able to make more of its own built-in lighting.. The front-facing camera, meanwhile, gets an aperture upgrade, from f/2.2 on the G5 to f/2.0 on the G5S, so your selfies should look slightly cleaner than before.. Motorola Moto G5S 32 GB (Single Sim) UK SIM-Free Smartphone - Lunar Grey. The sticking point here is resolution: the five-megapixel sensor inevitably means you’ll capture less sharp detail than you would with something like the eight-megapixel selfie camera on the Vodafone Smart V8.. Motorola deserves credit for responding to criticism of the G5, and with the Moto G5S it’s certainly got some things right. The new design is beautiful, the screen is bright and punchy and the camera has gone from a mediocre snapper to a best-in-class contender.. The catch is that the G5S comes with an asking price of £219 – £44 dearer than the original G5. That’s hard to swallow in the fiercely competitive budget phone market, especially when performance and battery life are no better than they were on 2016’s Moto G4. The G5S is a likeable phone, sure enough, but it needs a significant price drop before I can recommend it.. Apple Watch 3 Google Pixel 2 Kodi Oculus Rift Sky Soundbox iPad Pro iPhone X.
