Review of IUNI N1 (Gionee S5.1 Pro) Gionee S6 Pro appeared on the site TENAA. Review of IUNI N1 (Gionee S5.1 Pro) - a beautiful and powerful smartphone in the glass. Smartphone IUNI N1, aka Gionee S5.1 Pro. Cute phone out of metal and glass with MT6753 and 2GB of RAM on board, 5-inch AMOLED screen, 13 megapixel camera and battery 2400 mAh. Gionee Company - one of the largest Chinese manufacturers of phones, mainly their products outside of China is presented under other brands. But sometimes they go out and "purely its own" crafts,. so recently Gionee decided to directly compete with Xiaomi and Meizu , for which. established its brand with android and glitches - called IUNI.. We have before us one of the relatively low-end models - IUNI N1, which should attract buyers design and performance. And test a smartphone can say, the potential of the models have quite good.. Me drew a smartphone design, wonderful AMOLED screen and a relatively low price of $ 150 at the time of purchase. Powerful MT6753 only adds interest to the model. The manual for Gionee look here!. Specifications of IUNI N1 (Gionee S5.1 Pro). Processor: MT6753 1.3 GHz 8 core ARM Cortex-A53. Network 2 SIM, GSM, WCDMA, FDD-LTE 1800/2100/2600. Screen: 5 "HD AMOLED, Gorilla Glass. The main camera is 13 megapixel with flash. Dimensions: 145 x 70 x 6,3 mm, weight 129 g. GPS: GPS + AGPS + GLONASS. The housing is made of metal with glass inserts in the front and rear surfaces. Appearance and assembly IUNI N1 (Gionee S5.1 Pro). Perhaps this is the most important advantage of the smartphone. Taking it in his hands, let out absolutely do not want to - in a combination of glass and metal housing makes good impressions. going, and in this model the glass 2.5D (ie slightly convex) is installed on both the front part and on the back cover!. It looks impressive, but what sensations! Describe the words I can not, but believe me - it's just that the device, which is simply a pleasure to hold in your hand. The manufacturer claims tempered glass on the back and on the screen, but as we know, all the same scratched glass. Because the coating to protect against scratches, it. is necessary to drive such a nice beauty in an ordinary plastic bag .... Build a great, body molded, because no cracks and squeaks is not here at all. The side edges of metal, powder-coated. The similarity with the iPhone reaches its climax here - faces separators to improve the signal connector 3.5 mm from the bottom, along with microUSB and 2 speakers ... with the iPhone IUNI N1 you can not, but the design drawing obvious. Though I must admit it is rather an illusion of similarity, all the same a lot of differences.. Due to the 5-inch screen and a small thickness, the smartphone perfectly fits in your hand, it is convenient to operate with just one hand. Weight can also be recorded in the pros - IUNI N1 is. The thickness in comparison with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. All the control buttons are located on the right side of smart phones and also made of metal.. And all the connectors and openings in the cabinet are located on the bottom - 3.5 mm, microUSB, 2 speaker slots (although there is one speaker).. No backlight buttons, but there is a LED notification.. It confused me a little fact protruding camera from the glass surface - if not cover. The flash is small, relatively weak.. Dimensions of the smartphone compared to conventional 5-inch smartphones, although the scope of above and below the screen is not small.. Compare with Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. The smartphone is set a 5-inch AMOLED screen with HD resolution. Considering the price, like as it would be logical to see FullHD, but why - the big question. For 5-inch HD is the perfect. solution - the load on the iron and the battery less, the picture is not worse. In general, the screen in the most common IUNI AMOLED. This is such screens are very popular who is quite the. Personally, I like this type of screen is much larger than usual TFT. The colors are much juicier than even in very good Redmi Note 3, not to mention the "Hulk" Oukitel K10000.. I also note that the screen is protected by a curved glass Gorilla Glass, so safety glasses sit here is bad - they're just smaller than the area the front surface. So it is better to buy film.. Installed a small by modern standards, the battery is 2400 mAh, but the use of HD AMOLED display gives positive results - IUNI N1 at medium active load quietly resides on a single charge day and. a half, if even less active use of the phone, then charge enough for 2 day. On average, provided that the phone is removed from the charging at 8 am to 10 pm is about 20-30 per cent, provided. simple toys 2-3 hours, calls for 1 hour, 10-15 photos, the full-time post and whatsapp / facebook.. It is a normal result for such a thin smartphone.. According to the Chinese tradition of good smartphone has support for two SIM cards, but it is not the most convenient option arrangement, when we have to choose - or 2 SIM or SIM and microSD.. Yes, there are options to file the microSD and SIM, but this option "is not for everyone." 4G LTE support is present in the majority of standards in Russia, there are no questions. quality is also not satisfactory - the signal level even slightly above average.. Navigation and GPS in IUNI N1. Another point, which is nothing special to say. There are GPS, GLONASS there, everything works fine, although the test signal is not very much.. CALL speaker in a smartphone, but rather good and loud. The same applies to voice speaker and microphone - the sound bright and clean.. The sound in the headphones left a pleasant feeling, although information about the dedicated audio chip, I have not seen, so do not rule out that it is a manufacturer of a little "has worked". The manufacturer installed in the smart phone is very powerful 8-core MT6753 and 2 GB of RAM. In the medium price segment it is a very common solution, so no surprises there - smooth and good. performance - easily digested 3D games - and does not even try to brake in ordinary life. Yes, I would like to 3 GB of RAM, but using "naked» Android 5.1 there is no lack of memory.. Gionee separately praised the camera in your device, promising photos almost at the level of iPhone, but it all just beautiful promises. Camera in IUNI N1 turned out so-so - like and quickly. focus, good color, good shots at night. However, the detail is poor, there is a feeling that is made with 8 MP interpolation. Flash is also not enough for normal illumination. feeling that more is in the negative of device, is objectively the only serious drawback smartphone. In terms of camera smartphones is in the range of 80-100 dollars.. In general, I note the high stability of "pure" flash for all the tests, and the use did not have any problems and hang-ups.. Conclusions on the Review of IUNI N1. IUNI N1, also known as Gionee S5.1 Pro was very nice and "flat" model. It can be seen and experience products in the production of "atypical" meshes (building materials) and its approach to. Given the high capacity, an interesting screen AMOLED and basically low price - the smartphone is definitely worth the money, and maybe even might cost a little more. The only miscalculation I would call camera, one can expect a similar phone for 90-100 dollars, but not at 150 or higher. I wrote it disadvantage, because in the background of the design, build,. display, power, and expect to see a good camera, but you see only the usual, with low detail and a weak flash.. The smartphone can be safely recommend to fans pretty compact and powerful device for the low price. Strictly contraindicated haters AMOLED screens, fans not to charge a smartphone more than 3.

Earlier this month, we told you that the Gionee GN9007 had been certified in China by TENAA. At the time, going by the model number and the. specs, it would have made perfect sense for this handset to be called the Gionee Elife S7 Mini. After all, the model number GN9007 would fit in perfectly between the Gionee Elife S7 (GN9006) and Gionee Elife E8 (GN9008). According to those familiar with Gionee's plans, the GN9007 will be known as the Gionee S5.1 Pro although it doesn't share the same design as the Gionee S5.1. The new handset will come with a 5-inch display, carrying a resolution of 720 x 1280. That works out to a pixel density of 294. Under the hood, you'll find the MediaTek MT6753 SoC, which will contain an octa-core CPU, and the PowerVR G6200 GPU. 2GB of RAM is inside, along with 16GB of native storage. A 13MP camera graces the back of the unit, and an 8MP front-facing snapper handles selfies and video chats. A 2400mAh battery keeps the generator humming, and Android 5.1 is pre-installed with the Gionee Amigo3.1 skin on top. Quite svelte at 6.45mm thin, the Gionee S 5.1 Pro supports 4G LTE connectivity and has dual SIM, dual standby capabilities. The price of the handset is expected to be in the $300 range.
