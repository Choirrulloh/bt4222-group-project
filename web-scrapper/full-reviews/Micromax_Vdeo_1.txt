Micromax Vdeo 1 - user opinions and reviews. swapnil, 10 Feb 2017 nice phone What is the weight of this mobile. This price 4g volte very good. just battery is small just 1600 mah. apart of that over all performance is satisfactory.. mag, 24 Jan 2017 This is one of the worst phone in decent times.. I bought this phone for my mother.The speaker... more There is a lot more to a phone than just the speaker volume, there are lots of different elements that make a phone itself, the speaker volume being only a small part of this. So a low speaker volume doesn't necessarily mean the phone is bad. Also this phone isn't too bad for a compact budget phone, if you wanted more you could always think of going a bit higher in price range, as there are some very good value phones for just over Â100. But either way this phone doesn't seem too bad. This is one of the worst phone in decent times. I bought this phone for my mother.The speaker volume is very low.. why instagram layout doenst work in this phone. ??? still a suspense from store and service centre??.

At Micromax we thrive on our understanding of the Indian consumer, consistently deriving insights and delivering innovative products to the market. 2016 has seen a marked slowdown in the long term trend of Feature Phones users shifting to Smart Phones. Two barriers we identified were perceived high cost of data and a lack of a differentiated mass-use case. With the launch of the Vdeo range we have focused on these issues. We believe Video calling that is as simple as making a voice call, in a stable environment, will be a strong use case especially in smaller towns. This feature, coupled with free internet connectivity with the pre-bundled Reliance Jio SIM is a compelling proposition that will accelerate the switch from feature phones to Smartphones. Our leadership position and strong brand equity has allowed Micromax, for the first time in the industry, to bring together key players in the eco-system to deliver a complete solution for our consumers.. Of course, the Vdeo range is fully loaded with best-in-class features for an entry level Smartphone – including 4G VoLTE, Android Marshmallow, Quad core processors, great battery performance and housed in a premium and stylish metal body. We are extremely proud that we have managed to deliver this bundle of features in phones priced under Rs 5000..

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Quad-core, 1300 MHz, ARM Cortex-A7, 32-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance..

The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 15.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 12.0 days (288 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

According to Shubhajit Sen, Chief Marketing Officer of Micromax Informatics, data shows the average selling price for 4G phones in India is still Rs 11,000, much more than what what the monthly income is for many households. “Around 75 per cent of the population earns less than Rs 5000 per month. And while Indian smartphones are the second cheapest in the world, they are still unaffordable for many in the country,” points out Sen.. This is why Micromax is launching the Vdeo series, which will focus on bringing 4G, along with smartphone capabilities but at a budget price. Sen says nearly 72 per cent smartphones in India are on 3G or less than 3G networks, but it is expected that by 2021 India will have 45 per cent 4G connectivity. And that is the market that Micromax hopes to capture with its Vdeo series: Users who might be switching from a feature phone to a smartphone for the first time and want to try out 4G.. Sen points out that Micromax as a brand still has the potential of filling the gap thanks to their great distribution network.With Vdeo series, the company hopes to lure in customers with the Rs 5000 and below pricing along with the free Jio SIM capabilities..

Asked why they chose to pre-install Google Duo on the phone instead of WhatsApp, he pointed out that in their testing Duo has proved to be a lot more stable. “Of course, they will install WhatsApp on their own, but what we’ve also seen is that Duo’s simple UI works in its favour,” he argues.. Micromax says they are hoping that by December onwards these phones will all be Made in India. The company hopes to hit half a million in production in the next six to eight weeks.. The Indian smartphone maker, which has seen its market share decline in the category according to IDC’s last set of numbers, is hoping for a comeback with this new Vdeo segment.. Sen points out that in India, the entry level smartphone segment (which was under Rs 6000) and the biggest driver of volume has been declining. “If you look at Counterpoint Research data, this segment has seen a drop year on year. But there is a need for data, for smartphones. We think the Vdeo series will be a compelling 4G phone which will end up reinvigorating this category, which is critical for smartphone growth in India,” says Micromax’s CMO..
