more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. posted by Paul K.. 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. Introduction Meizu is one of those brand names you may have only heard of if you were a bit of an extreme smartphone geek (like most of us here are). As you may have guessed, it's hailing from China, and is a natural competitor to the slightly more popular Xiaomi in that it offers bargain-priced phones at every tier. Here, we will be looking at the Meizu MX6. The MX series used to be the flagship of the company but has now been superseded by the Pro family. Still, the MX6 vies to be a very powerful handset at an aggressive price point. What’s in the box: Meizu MX6 Wall charger USB Type-C data cable Quick start booklet and SIM eject tool Design It has been fairly obvious for a while now that Meizu isn’t afraid to take design cues from Apple’s iPhone , but we would say it usually does a fair amount of effort to imbue some of its own DNA into the mix. For years, the MX series has been well-known to have thin bodies and rounded-off corners at the back for better ergonomics. Just like the Meizu Pro 6 , which was released in early 2016, the phone is made of metal and its plastic antenna bands at the back have been stylishly pushed towards the top and bottom ends. It feels nice, cool, and reassuringly sturdy when held all the while being a bit lighter than an observer might expect. Its buttons sink in with a reassuring click and the overall hardware experience is pretty high. The physical home button makes a return and, as usual, there are no capacitive navigational buttons around it. Shaped like an ellipse, the home key serves three purposes — a fingerprint scanner, back button if tapped, and home button if pressed. This unique approach allows Meizu to maintain the minimalistic design of its phones. On the back, we have a slightly protruding camera, neighbored by its two-tone LED flash. By today’s standards, a camera hump is a very normal thing, so we wouldn’t say we paid any mind to it. Display The Meizu MX6 is equipped with a 5.5-inch display with a 1080 x 1920 pixel resolution. This makes for a pixel density of 401 ppi — more than enough for a crisp image with no individual pixels visible to the naked eye. Its colors, however, are off on almost every mark in the sRGB scale, and the display's temperature is noticeably cold, measuring at 7685 K. Numbers aside, we wouldn't say that the display is annoyingly blue, though the cold hue is definitely visible. Its colors are OK in real-life use and we were only truly annoyed by the punchiness of its saturated reds. The contrast calibration also looks to be a little off, with highlights always punching through while shadows stay dark, so setting a comfortable brightness to view a video is sometimes a chore. We've got a slider to manually adjust display temperature and a Twilight- or F.lux-like blue light filter, which can be set to automatically activate when the sun is down, keeping in tune with today's trends. The maximum brightness goes up to 498 nits and the display is OK to use outside in daytime. It can also go down as low as 1 nit, making for comfortable viewing in the dark.. 6.05 x 2.96 x 0.29 inches. 153.6 x 75.2 x 7.25 mm. 6.01 x 2.94 x 0.29 inches. 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35 mm. 5.69 x 2.72 x 0.29 inches. 144.55 x 69.2 x 7.25 mm. 6.06 x 3.01 x 0.37 inches. 154 x 76.5 x 9.3 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. posted on 04 Nov 2016, 10:15. According to the cons, if I were living in mainland China, the only thing to be concerned about is the camera. I find that hard to believe.. (Posts: 6747; Member since: 30 Sep 2014). posted on 05 Nov 2016, 01:36. while the camera can capture better image than Mi5 (better color reproduction and detail), check that poster on comparison tool... and it's camera just as good as Galaxy A7(2016). (Posts: 2315; Member since: 14 Aug 2014). posted on 04 Nov 2016, 10:15. The Anandtech review taught me this phone is pretty lackluster...skip!. (Posts: 1099; Member since: 05 Oct 2015). posted on 14 Nov 2016, 13:22. Uh, the anandtech review was for the Pro 6, nit the MX6. (Posts: 6747; Member since: 30 Sep 2014). posted on 05 Nov 2016, 01:47. comparing it to Pixel XL? seriously? Pixel XL is flagship with 3times pricetag :-/. can't you find more proper smartphone to compare with this phone?. Mi5 is still fine since it have similar pricetag, and MotoZ play is also far more expensive... next time please compare it to other smartphone with similar pricing bracket (low-mid in this case) and screensize. like Galaxy A7, Moto G4 Plus, Oppo F1, RN3pro. and btw, RN4 is much cheaper than MX6, and have same processor.

Meizu may be relatively unheard of in the west, but the MX6 continues the company’s track record of making smartphones with a familiar design and key features at a much lower price than big name rivals. It’s good value, but fails to excite.. Meizu MX6 price and release date Shipping worldwide from MeizuWorld.com Available in four colors, priced at $400 (£340, AU$565) Design and display The slender body has a familiar design Bright screen with good viewing angles The rear camera slightly protrudes. Unless you’re reading this from somewhere in Asia there’s a good chance you haven’t heard of Meizu, a company which – like so much of the emerging smartphone talent – hails from China, where it competes heavily with Xiaomi, Oppo and Huawei.. Meizu offers a wide range of smartphones, but its latest selection shares more than a passing resemblance to the iPhone 7 and HTC 10 – a likely deliberate design choice.. The MX6 is one of the latest high-end phones in the range, and whilst not quite considered a flagship (that would be the Pro family of phones), the MX6 still has many of the assets we would expect on a top smartphone.. This 1080p, 5.5-inch handset comes in three eerily familiar colors: Rose Gold, Silver, Gray and Gold, but the spec of each model remains the same. Meizu has chosen a 2.3GHz MediaTek deca-core chipset to power the MX6, accompanied by 4GB of RAM and 32GB of memory.. Power comes from a 3060mAh battery, and you’ll find a 12MP rear camera, and a 5MP camera up front.. The Meizu MX6 is out now, and you can buy it directly from MeizuWorld.com for the standard price of $400 (£340, AU$565), though it is currently available at a heavily-discounted $309 (£265, AU$437), making it an extremely tempting choice.. For the money it appears that all the major bases have been covered, but to find out whether the MX6 can really compete, we need to take a closer look at this unashamedly recognizable design.. To those of you already up-to-speed on Meizu’s latest line-up, the appearance of the MX6 should come as no surprise. Whilst not marketed as its top-end “premium” handset, the build quality is surprisingly solid, yet avoids feeling unnecessarily bulky.. The body is just 7.25mm thick, only a hair’s width thicker than the iPhone 7, but noticeably thinner than the 8.5mm Google Pixel. Tipping the scales at 155g, the MX6 is a little weightier than the aforementioned flagships, but this only helps to make this considerably cheaper smartphone feel more solid.. As far as the design and button placement goes, Meizu has played it safe with the MX6. On the right-hand side you’ll find a volume bar and power button about a third of the way down from the top, both of which are responsive, clicky, and raised enough to make it easy to locate them.. The top edge is devoid of anything other than a noise-cancelling microphone, whilst the left side is similarly barren, save for the slot that holds a dual nanoSIM tray. Unfortunately, it doesn’t double as a microSD card slot, leaving the storage fixed at 32GB.. The layout on the bottom edge is almost identical to an Apple iPhone 6 or iPhone 6S , with a 3.5mm headphone port on the left, USB Type-C port in the middle, and the single speaker grille on the right.. On the rear there’s a little nod to Apple's design, with an inscription reading "Designed by Meizu, LTE Mobile Phone Assembled in China". Though it may not be quite as glamorous as Apple's "Designed in California" tagline, the MX6 is assembled in Zhuhai, a small city just across the bay from the Foxconn plant in Shenzhen where Apple's iPhone is assembled.. The rear of the phone has a smooth metal finish and white stripes on the top and bottom, closely resembling the design of recent iPhones. The camera protrudes very slightly from the back, and looks almost identical to that on the HTC 10, whilst a dual-tone LED flash resides underneath.. Up front the home button doubles as a fingerprint scanner, just like you’d see on new Samsung, HTC or Apple handsets. The rest of the front is sparse, as there aren’t any capacitive buttons accompanying the home button.. The bezels surrounding the 5.5-inch IPS LCD 1080p screen are not the slimmest you’ll find, but are only a shade thicker than those on the similar-looking Blu Vivo 6 .. The screen itself packs in a pixel density of 403 pixels per inch, and achieves exceptional brightness levels with good viewing angles. Like other cheap IPS screens, the black levels aren’t a match for any of Samsung’s AMOLED displays, but they’re totally respectable for a phone of this price.. Next Page What's it like to use?.

Phone Reviews Product Reviews. Meizu is one of the many smartphone brands pushing its way out of China and into the consciousness of those who are more familiar with buying Android phones from LG, Samsung, HTC, Huawei, and ZTE. It’s most closely related to the latter two manufacturers, thanks to its slick designs, heavily customized user interfaces, and quite often, very reasonable price tags.. The Meizu MX6 would have once been a flagship phone for the company, but it has since introduced the Pro range, which supersedes the standard MX series. The specifications are still pleasingly upper-range, and the design and build quality are as good as any we’ve seen from Oppo, OnePlus, ZTE, and many others.. However, buying one will still be seen as a gamble, but should that really be the case? Is opting for a cheaper phone with strong specifications, despite not being overly familiar with the brand, a bad thing? We’ve been using the MX6 for a couple of weeks to see if it’s a welcome alternative to the growing number of excellent smartphones that sell for less than half the price of a big-name-brand device.. The Meizu MX6 looks like an iPhone — and it also feels like one when you’re holding it. While generally accepted today, it’s rather tiresome to have yet another phone that takes its styling cues from Apple’s ever-popular phone. Our review model has a white front panel broken up by a 5.5-inch screen and a stadium shape, multifunction home button. The rear panel is metal with a matte-brushed look, and antenna bands sweeping across the top and bottom, just like Apple’s new iPhone 7 .. While gripping the Meizu MX6, you’ll notice neatly curved sides that blend well into the 2.5D curved glass screen edges. It’s very comfortable, but also slippery, just like the iPhone 7 it closely resembles. There’s very little to “grab on to” when using the MX6 with one hand, and wrapping it in a case would be advisable if you’re a little accident prone.. It reminded me of the Oppo F1 Plus in its slightly bland subtlety, aside from the central camera lens on the rear, which injects a little character. It’s slightly heavier than the F1 Plus, at 155 grams, and a little thicker at 7.3mm. That’s squarely in between both the iPhone 7 and the ZTE Axon 7. The phone isn’t water- or shock-proof, but the build quality is superb, with no excess button movement, no imperfections around the bezel, and no creaks from the body. It’s what you’d expect a modern smartphone to feel like, almost regardless of how much it costs.. Demure and understated, but very well presented, the MX6 isn’t going turn heads thanks to outrageous styling, but it won’t turn them for looking like a cow’s behind either.. Meizu doesn’t use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors. It has used Samsung’s Exynos chips in the past, but has recently tasked MediaTek with powering some of its phones. The MediaTek Helio X20 is the chip inside the MX6. It’s a deca-core processor we last encountered inside Xiaomi’s Redmi Pro, where it performed acceptably.. Our model came with 4GB of RAM, and putting it through a few benchmark tests returned some interesting results. GeekBench 4 gave it 3767 multi and 1676 single, results very close to the Galaxy S7. Using AnTuTu , it scored 90,812, which is way below the Axon 7’s 128,000. The MX6 performed really well when playing games. Reckless Racing 3 was smooth and playable, as was Danmaku Unlimited in hard mode with HD graphics. The rear of the phone did get warm to the touch, which we also experienced with the Redmi Pro.. The MX6 performed really well when playing games.. Android 6.0 Marshmallow is installed – so you’re not getting the latest version of the OS, — and it comes with Meizu’s own Flyme user interface over the top. It’s visually very different from standard Android seen on Nexus phones and the Pixel, and comes with various apps and features added by Meizu, which inspire varying levels of irritation.. Probably the most striking change is the complete removal of Android’s back and recent buttons — both hardware and software. Instead, you swipe up on the screen to open the recents view, soft tap on the fingerprint sensor in the home button to go back, and fully press it down to return to the home screens. It’s completely different from any other Android phone, but surprisingly intuitive. It’s not better or worse than the established Android method — just slightly neater – and is arguably a system that didn’t need “fixing” in the first place.. The way notifications appear is one of the better alterations. They scroll along the information strip like a ticker at the top of the display on arrival, so if you’re looking at the screen, you won’t be interrupted by a massive dropdown box, and can still read the incoming message. It’s neat, handy, and a worthwhile change. The notification shade itself is attractive, and until swiping down, it’s sparsely populated with shortcuts. You can tailor these shortcuts to your liking, and include everything from a hot spot control to a flashlight shortcut.. There’s a split-screen mode that only operates with certain apps, and is activated in the recent apps menu, where you look out for apps with a “multi” button next to them. Meizu installs a few standard apps, including a weather app, and a video and music app, as well as access to its own app store. None of these can be uninstalled. There’s also a Cleanmaster-style security app that frees up memory, shows battery life, and activates the antivirus software. All apps are spread across multiple home screens, and there’s no option to add an app tray.. Flyme may look very different from Google’s Android, but its smooth and slick, and the flat, colorful style is really easy on the eyes. It’s far from the hateful third-party user interfaces we’ve seen in the past, and aside from the annoying apps that can’t be uninstalled, it’s not a negative point against the MX6. However, its presence does restrict future updates, which may never arrive at all. This potentially leaves security holes open — and the Android build lagging behind newer phones.. The 5.5-inch screen is produced by Sharp, and uses in-cell technology — where normally separate screen layers are combined into one — for a highly responsive touch surface. Feather-light touches on the screen are all that’s needed here, and it’s a real pleasure to use, particularly when playing games.. Featherlight touches on the screen are all that’s needed here, and it’s a real pleasure to use.. The 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution is lower than many of its competitors, but doesn’t affect normal use. Turning the brightness up to maximum does begin to wash the screen out. There’s a color temperature setting, and an eye-protection mode for lower blue-light levels at night, complete with a scheduler for automatic use.. A 3,060mAh battery sounds capacious, but in reality, it was only just enough for a day’s worth of average use. Playing a few games, doing some social networking, and running a benchmark sucked 20-percent in about 90 minutes. Use the MX6 hard, and it’ll likely struggle to last a full day. It actually closely matched my iPhone 7 Plus for battery performance, despite the iPhone’s smaller capacity cell, leading us to believe software optimization is the issue.. Arguably one of the most important features on any modern smartphone, the camera can make or break the device, and convince us to recommended it or not. The MX6 has a 12-megapixel Sony IMX386 sensor, which has an f/2.0 aperture, and a 1.25 micron pixel size with phase detection autofocus. It doesn’t have optical image stabilization.. That all sounds good, but the results don’t live up to the potential. The first issue is a tendency to over-expose. I found myself tweaking pictures with Snapseed to get them just right, especially when they’d been taken on gray, overcast English days. Doing this definitely brought out the best, but the results still can’t match pictures taken with the Axon 7 or the Honor 8, let alone more expensive camera phones like the Huawei P9, the Google Pixel, or the Apple iPhone 7 Plus.. It doesn’t inspire us to take pictures we’d want to keep or share.. But that’s not the worst part. The MX6 has focusing and detail problems, resulting in oddly out-of-focus images that appear blurred. It’s not the screen making the images look odd either — they looked even worse after transferring them onto a larger display. It’s noticeable when looking at images at normal scale, but zoom in and you’d think they’d been taken with a 3-megapixel camera five years ago.. The same issue doesn’t plague the 5-megapixel front camera, which comes with FotoNation’s effective smart beauty software, for extensive tweaking of your selfies after the photo has been snapped. This includes slimming of the face, smoothing out and lightning of the skin, and plenty more. Go mad, and you’ll look like you do in a fairground mirror, but when used subtly, it does the job well.. Sadly, overall, the MX6 doesn’t inspire us to take pictures we’d want to keep or share.. The Meizu MX6 costs $300, or around 250 British pounds, which is a very reasonable price for a smartphone with these specifications. buyers should be aware it won’t connect to 4G LTE GSM networks, and will only operate on 3G. In the U.K., it has better 4G LTE connectivity, but we still found it more often selected 3G high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) signals.. You’ll have to import an MX6 unless you live in China, so warranties will come through the company you choose. For example, GearBest , a popular online retailer specializing in Chinese electronics, sells the MX6 for $290 and has a comprehensive one-year repair warranty, a three-day dead-on-arrival guarantee, and a 45-day money back offer if the phone suddenly stops working.. The Meizu MX6 is a subtly attractive smartphone with superb build quality and a compact metal body, and although the software includes one of the better third-party user interfaces available, it introduces some unnecessary alterations. The camera, which should be a standout feature these days, really lets the overall package down.. R-just Armor King Stainless Steel Mobile Phone Cover. The MX6’s low price makes it tempting. It’s not a flagship phone, and the price puts it at the high-end of the midrange, so can it be beaten? To meet the $300 price tag, take a look at the ZTE Axon Mini , which connects to U.S. 4G networks, has a great camera, a beautiful AMOLED screen, and a strong audio system. We liked it so much, we gave it an award when it was announced earlier this year.. Spend a little more and you’ll get the ZTE Axon 7. It’s $400, so around $100 more than the MX6, but it’s well worth the extra investment. It’ll connect to the right networks, has a far better camera, and a faster processor.. The OnePlus 3T is also highly recommended, but you’ll have to spend a little more once again.. In the U.K., the Axon 7 Mini is also recommended at a very similar price to the Meizu MX6, and the Xiaomi Redmi Pro — which has a better camera — can be purchased for less, if you’re open to other imported phones. We’re also fans of the Honor 5X, which is cheaper than the MX6 and has better connectivity, plus a surprisingly good camera.. The MX6 isn’t especially rugged, and isn’t water-resistant, so you’ll have to be careful with it. Android 6.0 has already been superseded, and our review model hadn’t seen an Android security patch since March, making the software out of date. This doesn’t give us much hope for future updates, and although the device is compatible with Android 7.0 Nougat, owners will need to wait until Meizu produces a version of its Flyme user interface based on the new version before getting it. Its newly launched Flyme 6 is still based on Android 6.0, so we’re not expecting anything soon.. Based on this, the MX6 is a phone you would buy for today, and not for tomorrow.. No, certainly not if you live in the U.S. It’s surpassed in ability and performance by the ZTE Axon 7 Mini, which can be pre-ordered for almost the same price. Spend a little more, and considerably better smartphones are available. The MX6 suffers due to the clutch of excellent, reasonably priced smartphones out there.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. my week of using the Meizu MX6. as my daily driver, two thoughts kept popping in my head.. Holy crap, this thing looks and feels just like an iPhone.. How is this phone only US$299 (HK$2,400)?????. OnePlus 3' US$400 price tag wasn't already crazy enough (remember, HTC, Samsung and Apple are selling their phones at US$700 or more), Meizu's latest managed to slash another Benjamin off the tag. less powerful than the OnePlus 3 and other 2016 flagships like the LG G5 or Samsung Galaxy S7, but it's a compromise worth making if. Here's where the MX 6 is "inferior" to other new phones: its camera is only 12MP, and its processor, the. 2.3GHz MediaTek Helio X20 deca-core, is slower than other flagships, including Meizu's own Pro 6. I ran Antutu benchmark and the MX6 finished with a 77,195 final score, whereas the Huawei P9 Plus and OnePlus 3 scored. Huawei P9 Plus (left); Meizu MX6 (middle) and OnePlus 3. Everything else about this phone screams premium. It's yet another metal unibody phone, but somehow its metal feel more metal-ey than Huawei's P9 and (duh) the LG G5. Like I said, it feels just like an iPhone. The device's home button, as I've written earlier, is a unique take on the ubiquitous button. that deviates from how Android phones operate. If you missed my earlier piece and you're interested in how Meizu's take differs, then please click on the link. If you need the TL;DR version, know that Meizu has done away with Android's three button scheme.. That's possible because the phone runs Meizu's own Flyme software (5.2 here) on top of Android 6.0. Unlike most phones from China, Flyme is a clean software (with lots of flat icons and bright Google-like colors) that mostly stays out of the way. Yes, you do get Meizu's own undeletable web browser -- which is awkward and has a "Exit" button that wipes away all your webpages -- but swapping in Google Chrome and making that the default takes a minute.. The Flyme software is very clean looking.. On day-to-day use, the device proved to be solid, but not the best. 6-inch x 2.96-inch x 0.29-inch dimension and rounded edges make it easy to hold, and its 3,060 mAH battery can last me a day, I did run into stutters with the phone. Mostly it was Instagram -- the app was unstable on the MX 6 and crashed a few times. I think it might have to do with Instagram's new update (the one with the ripoff Snapchat feature),. but I tested the same updated app on the Huawei P9 Plus and even Meizu's own Pro 5 without any problems. I'm not sure if it was my device specifically, or something with MX6's software. But Instagram on it is problematic. The camera, too, froze on me twice -- though I used the camera so often, freezing twice is equivalent to something like a 0.5% failure rate. I was on Twitter and Facebook and Spotify a lot and had no problems.. Spotify, in particular, was a great experience, because Meizu's Flyme software includes awesome gesture actions! I wrote about it in-depth in. another post here , but essentially, you can swipe your finger on the MX6's screen while its off to launch apps. That meant I could skip or rewind tracks on Spotify by just swiping on the display without waking the phone. There are lots of other gestures. For example, you can draw an S to launch Facebook, or the camera, or Whatsapp, or Google Maps. You can draw an O to launch Chrome, or Settings, whatever. Meizu offers more than ten gestures, and you have the option to turn on/off all, none, or whichever ones you like..

September 9, 2016 - Written By Alexander Maxham. Meizu is one of the more popular smartphone makers coming out of China. They are right up there with the likes of Huawei, Lenovo, and Xiaomi. Meizu has seen some incredible growth in the past couple of years, part of that is due to them growing their portfolio from just a single smartphone – in the MX lineup – to having smartphones hitting all types of price points. Despite the Meizu M3 Note, and PRO. 6 being some of the best smartphones available, the company hasn’t turned its head away from the MX line, and recently announced the Meizu MX6. It’s fairly similar to the Meizu PRO 6, but it is a better smartphone, at least on paper. Sporting a deca-core processor from MediaTek, how does the Meizu MX6 stack up against competitors both in and out of China? Let’s find out.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. It’s important to note here that the Meizu MX6 is priced around $350 USD (in China, it retails for 1999 RMB). So while it is a pretty cheap flagship smartphone, it does put it at about the same price as the likes of the OnePlus 3 and ZTE AXON 7, both coming out of China as well. Spec-wise, the MX6 sports a 5.5-inch 1080p display and is powered by the MediaTek Helio X20 processor. This is a deca-core processor featuring two quad-core clusters and a dual-core cluster. It breaks down as dual-core 2.3GHz Cortex-A72, quad-core 1.9GHz Cortex-A53, and a quad-core 1.4GHz Cortex-A53 cluster all wrapped into one. This is paired with the Mali T880 GPU, and 4GB of RAM. There is also 32GB of storage included. There is also a 3060mAh battery powering the smartphone, although it is non-removable.. When it comes to optics, Meizu has gone with a slightly different sensor this time around. There’s a 12-megapixel camera around back. With a pixel size of 1.25um, meaning that the camera will allow even more light get into the sensor, allowing for even better images, especially in low-light. It sports a f/2.0 aperture as well. The front-facing camera is a 5-megapixel shooter with a f/2.0 aperture as well.. The unboxing experience with the Meizu MX6 is about what you would expect here. Open up the box, and the Meizu MX6 is laying right there on top. Beneath that there is a pouch full of documentation – including a quick start guide and warranty information – with the SIM ejection tool included. Below that is the wall adapter and USB Type-C to Type-A cable for charging the Meizu MX6. There’s nothing that’s out of the ordinary here with the Meizu MX6.. Meizu is one of those companies that puts out some amazing looking and feeling devices. The Meizu MX6 fits right in with the rest of their lineup. Although it does look fairly familiar to their other smartphones released this year, like the Meizu PRO 6 and the Meizu. M3 Note, both of which we recently reviewed. What we have here is a metal frame and back with a glass front. Although we did get the Meizu MX6 in a different color than the PRO 6, it does have the same design, more or less. One thing that I really like about the design though, is the antenna lines. By now, we all know that they are here, and here to stay, but that doesn’t mean that Meizu can’t make them look as minimal as possible. And that’s what they’ve done here. The antenna lines have been moved further up/down (depending on if you’re looking at the top or bottom of the smartphone) making them look a bit more minimal. Of course, we’d rather them not be here at all, but this is better than some of the other antenna lines we’ve seen from other smartphones.. Now yes their is a metal jacket on the MX6, and the camera does protrude a bit. However, it does not protrude as much as the camera on the Moto Z line of smartphones do. It’s very subtle, and I almost don’t mind that it protrudes at all. Beneath the camera is a dual LED flash, but there is no laser auto-focus here. One of the very few changes from the PRO 6. On the bottom of the device, there is a 3.5mm headphone jack, with the USB Type-C port and a speaker. There is a microphone placed at the top of the phone and the bottom, additionally, the volume rocker and power button are on the right side of the phone. Finally, the SIM card slot is on the left side. It is a dual nano SIM card slot, and not a micro SD card hybrid slot, unfortunately. Which means you can’t expand the storage on the MX6.. There’s no real complaints about the hardware and build quality with the Meizu MX6. As usual, they have knocked the ball out of the park. But now, their design is starting to become a bit “boring” as some would say. In fact, you can’t even really tell the difference between the Meizu M3 Note, MX6 and the PRO 6. Hopefully 2017 brings about some big changes for them, design-wise.. With the Meizu MX6, the company opted to stick with a 1080p display once again. While many would welcome that with open arms, especially due to the fact that the battery is a moderately sized, 3060mAh, many others are wishing that Meizu would jump on the QHD or 2K display bandwagon. Especially with VR becoming a pretty popular topic in recent months and years. With this being a 5.5-inch display, you do still get a decent pixel density of 403 pixels per inch. The display looks great, it’s got a slight hint of saturation, but not too much. And it is also more than visible when outdoors in direct sunlight. Something that not every other smartphone can boast.. The display here isn’t going to be the best for virtual reality, but it will more than do the trick for everyday tasks like checking email, Twitter, and even watching some media from the likes of YouTube and such. While the display may look great, the other side of the coin here is the digitizer. Displays can look amazing, but if they are paired with a crappy digitizer, then it’s going to give users a bad experience. The digitizer is what recognizes your finger whenever you touch the display. Needless to say, it’s an important part of any smartphone. The digitizer on the Meizu MX6, however, is pretty good. We won’t say it’s perfect, but we haven’t had any issues in our 2 weeks of using the device as our daily driver.. Using a smartphone like the Meizu MX6 is always interesting. This is because Meizu uses MediaTek chips (they used to use Samsung’s Exynos chips in their smartphones). These are chips that aren’t often seen in smartphones here in the West. Especially not the high-end chips like the Helio X20 which is present in the MX6. This is a unique chipset, to be honest. The Helio X20 is a deca-core processor, so there are three clusters here. There’s two quad-cores and a dual-core cluster. There’s a quad-core 1.4GHz Cortex-A53 cluster, quad-core 1.9GHz Cortex-A53 cluster and a dual-core 2.3GHz Cortex-A72 cluster. The idea with this tri-cluster setup is for the device to typically use the 1.9GHz quad-core cluster for most tasks. Allowing it to bump up to the 2.3GHz cores for more resource intensive tasks like gaming, and when in idle or standby, it can use the slower 1.4GHz cores to use less battery when the phone isn’t actively being used. Sounds good on paper, but how does it perform in the real world?. Using it side-by-side with the Honor 8 which houses Huawei’s own Kirin 950 processor, the MediaTek Helio X20 performs really well. There isn’t a stutter to be found in day-to-day usage, and standby time is pretty phenomenal as well. And that’s without using any of the crazy battery saving modes that are included on the MX6. There’s no complaints with the performance of the Helio X20 which is also paired with the Mali-T880 GPU. This is the same GPU that is found in most other high-end smartphones that aren’t running Qualcomm chipsets. This includes the Meizu PRO 6 as well as the Honor 8. There is also 4GB of RAM to boot, which gives you plenty of memory for storing apps without needing to reload them every time you switch from one to another.. There’s nothing new here with the fingerprint sensor. Meizu seems to have found a placement on their phones for the fingerprint sensor and stuck with it over the years. Their first fingerprint sensor was in the Meizu MX4 Pro. It is located on the front of the device, in the home button. To unlock the MX6, just press your finger on the home button and it unlocks within seconds. It’s lightning fast, although they do have some competition from Huawei/Honor in that area.. However, the fingerprint sensor does a whole lot more than just unlocking the phone. It also serves as a home button and back button. It’s a capacitive button too, so just lightly touch the button and you’ll go back. If you press the button like a physical button, you’ll head home. Now to get to recents, just swipe up from the bottom bezel and you’ll see all of your recently opened apps. You can also jump into multi-window mode from there. But more on that in the software section.. With the Meizu MX6, we ran three benchmarks to make sure that everything is on the up and up. Now since the internals are exactly the same as the Meizu PRO 6, and it is running the same software (Android 6.0 with Flyme 5.2) we expected similar results. And that’s exactly what we got with the MX6. You can see the results from AnTuTu, Geekbench and 3D Mark down below.. Just a quick disclaimer here, Meizu measures battery life a bit differently in Flyme. Where as most operating systems will reset the statistics whenever you charge up to 100% and show you stats from that entire battery cycle, Flyme only shows you the past 3, 6, or 12 hours. Making it tough to show how good (or bad) the battery is on the Meizu MX6. But we do have plenty of screenshots to show you, in the gallery below. Once more, we ran PC Mark which gave us a score of 9 hours and 28 minutes. That’s pretty similar to the Honor 8 we reviewed recently, but slightly lower than the Moto Z Play.. While we can’t say for sure that you should get around 4-5 hours on screen time with the Meizu MX6, it is pretty likely that you can. It’s also extremely likely that you’ll be able to get through a full day without needing to recharge the phone. Unless you are a very heavy user, it should definitely last the entire day.. Meizu hasn’t changed up their software all that much in the past few years. Flyme has gotten some pretty small changes here and there, but there’s not much that needs changing anyways. Onboard the Meizu MX6, we have Android 6.0 Marshmallow running with Flyme 5.2 on top. That is the latest version of Flyme, but as of last month, it’s not the latest version of Android. Meizu doesn’t show which security patch is on the MX6, in settings, but we do know from past experience that Meizu is pretty good with updates. They never come as fast as users want them, but they do at least come, fairly often. As for when Android 7.0 Nougat will be available, that’s tough to say. And as usual, Meizu isn’t committing to a firm date for the update.. Flyme is actually one of my favorite Android skins out there. Not only is it colorful, but it adds a lot of useful features, while still being lightweight enough to keep the phone from lagging or being bogged down. Of course, the big omission from Flyme is the app drawer. This is common with smartphones out of Asia, specifically China. It appears that the way users in Asia use their phones, is different from those in the west. There are a few complaints that we have with Flyme, which are basically the same as the ones in our Meizu PRO 6 review. But let’s get these out of the way before we talk about the good of the UI.. First up, Meizu has a separate app called “Security”. This is a bit confusing, as there are a number of settings here that should be part of the settings app. Particularly the data usage, and battery profiles. The cleaner, accelerator, and the others in here are okay to be in a separate app. But for normal users that are looking to turn on a battery saver mode, they aren’t going to jump into the Security app to do that, most would go to the Settings app, as that is where it is located on literally every other smartphone. The other is when it comes to Gmail notifications (Inbox as well). Notifications show the subject in black text, so that it’s tough to see the subject of your emails in the notification bar.. Continuing on with the notification shade, the toggles are customizable here, but not as customizable as we’d like. When you move one toggle out of the shade, another one pops in there. Which means you can’t have any more or less than 12 toggles (3 rows of 4) in the notification shade. Likely not an issue for most people, but it can still be a bit of an issue. You can choose whether the notifications appear on the lock screen or not, and one of my favorite features (which seems to only be available on smartphones out of China) is the ability to show your network speed. Allowing you to see if you are actually getting activity from the network you are connected too.. Now Meizu has added in a new feature, which is multi-window. This was present on the Meizu M3 Note, which we reviewed recently, but not on the Meizu PRO 6 for whatever reason. It’s a bit of an interesting implementation to say the least. Basically, you swipe up to get into recents, then you will see a “Multi” button on the right side of the apps that are compatible. Tap on that and you will open the app in multi-window. The bottom half will show a launcher with the apps that are compatible, which there aren’t too many. Some of the third-party apps that are compatible include Facebook, Twitter and Spotify.. When it comes to third-party interfaces, not everyone is going to love a particular one. For instance, some love EMUI, some hate it. Some love Sense, others hate it. But Flyme may be the best interface that is available right now. It looks nothing like stock Android, so the purists won’t like it, but boy does it add in a ton of features. If you haven’t given Flyme a try recently, you should definitely do so. It does take a bit of time to get used to it, but it’s a great interface to have on top of Marshmallow, and the company is always working to improve it.. The Meizu MX6’s camera also hasn’t changed much from the PRO 6 released earlier on in the year. The software is much the same, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing to be honest. The camera UI is laid out quite nicely. On the left side there is a shortcut to camera settings, along with the toggle for the front-facing camera, filters, timer and flash. On the opposite side you have the shutter in the middle with a shortcut to the gallery app – showing your last taken photo of course – above it and below that is the toggle for the different modes available on the MX6. Speaking of modes, there’s plenty of them here. There’s Auto, Manual, Video, Beauty, Panorama, Light Field, Slow-mo, Scan, Macro and GIF.. Manual mode is of course going to be our favorite mode, as it allows you to have complete control over the picture that you are taking. You can adjust the white balance, contrast, saturation, exposure, ISO and shutter speed. GIF is another good one, because who doesn’t enjoy a good GIF or two? This is a pretty simple mode. It allows you to record a video up to 6 seconds long, and it’ll just continuously loop, like an animated GIF would do. Now this isn’t particularly a new mode, we’ve seen it on other smartphones before, but it is still a cool one to check out.. The camera does perform pretty well, in day-to-day usage. We took a number of shots with the Meizu MX6 during our time with it, and found that most of the shots were pretty amazing. Now the Meizu PRO 6 sported a higher-megapixel sensor, versus the MX6, but the MX6 does have bigger pixels. This is something that is becoming popular in the industry as of late, and it also means that you’re going to get more light in your pictures. The macro mode performed pretty well too, giving us some great looking Bokeh effects. Of course, it still is no match for what you would see on a DSLR or even a mirrorless camera, but still pretty sweet for a smartphone camera. In the gallery below, you’ll see a number of images taken from the Meizu MX6, so you can see for yourself how well the camera works.. Build Quality, despite it becoming a bit boring at this point.. Fingerprint Sensor is fast as always. Camera, even though it looks worse on paper, it outperforms the PRO 6.. Battery Life is stellar, thanks to the Helio X20 SoC.. The “iPhone” look, sure the MX6 was announced before the iPhone 7, but it does have the exact same antenna lines and overall look.. Protruding camera, sure everyone’s doing it, but that doesn’t make it right or something customers want.. The Meizu MX6 is a great smartphone, there’s no denying that. Meizu is known for their great hardware, and a pretty stellar experience with Flyme OS. Sure there are a few issues that those in the West won’t be too excited about, but overall it’s a great smartphone. The Meizu MX6 seems to be a rather decent upgrade over the MX5 from last year, compared to the PRO 5 and the PRO 6, which seemed like a massive downgrade in a lot of areas.. Should you buy the Meizu MX6?. If you are in Europe or Asia, definitely. This is a smartphone that is made for China, so that means that the LTE bands won’t work in the US, unfortunately. However, we did get access to 3G and HSPA+ speeds on T-Mobile, there won’t be any 4G LTE speeds on either of the GSM carriers in the US. Luckily for those in Europe, many of the bands used in Asia line up perfectly, so you should get 4G LTE without much of a problem. If you are wanting a great looking smartphone, with top-of-the-line specs, and an amazing camera, then you definitely can’t go wrong with the Meizu MX6..

Esto también se puede leer en español.. Meizu's new MX6 offers an iPhone-inspired design for Android fans. It's hard not to notice that Meizu's MX6 bears striking similarity to Apple's handsets, but the phone offers quality and more.. by July 21, 2016 1:18 PM PDT. What you need to know Deca-core (10) Mediatek MT6797 Helio X20 5.5-inch full-HD display Flyme 5.2 OS on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow Comes in gray, silver, gold and rose gold 4GB RAM, 32GB onboard storage USB Type-C, fingerprint scanner 3,060mAh battery. Chinese smartphone Meizu maker may not be well-known outside of its homeland, but the company has got its fans in China, thanks to its iPhone-inspired designs for its products. And on first glance, it's obvious the Meizu MX6, launched earlier this week in Beijing, shares striking similarities with Apple's iPhone.. That said, the Meizu phone does have its own differences. For one, the rear 12-megapixel camera is located in the middle, which makes it less likely your finger will accidentally block your shot compared with the iPhone. Another thing going for it is that unlike other Android phones, the MX6 doesn't have the usual back and recent apps button.. Meizu's MX6 offers plenty of familiarity. Instead, the home button, which also serves as a fingerprint scanner, also acts as the back button with a simple touch of the button. You might be confused what I mean about that -- instead of pressing down on the button like you do the iPhone, you just need to touch the button once. It takes a while to get, but once you do, it's actually quite easy to navigate the Meizu Flyme OS, which is a customized version of Android 6.0.. The Meizu MX6's rear camera is located in a more central location compared to the Apple iPhone.. I do like the design of Flyme. Meizu has put in plenty of effort to make the UI design stand out compared to other Chinese Android skins and it shows. Each icon gets its own good-looking flat look. The end result is a UI that matches the iPhone-ish looks and could be something Apple wouldn't mind having in its own phones.. Overall, the build and quality of the MX6 impresses, and I think the phone has what it takes to do well. And with 3.2 million preregistrations for the phone before it even goes on sale, it looks like plenty of Chinese fans think the same thing, too. The phone will go on sale in China on July 30 for 1,999 yuan (which converts to around $300, £225 or AU$400) and will be available globally through third-party online vendors soon..

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. An iPhone look-alike that’s surprisingly good value for money. Who's this for? Should you buy it? The competition Nubia Z11 Read the full review: Nubia Z11 Motorola Moto G4 Plus Read the full review: Motorola Moto G4 Plus Blu Vivo 6 Read the full review: Blu Vivo 6. The Meizu MX6 is one of the company’s first handsets to be launched worldwide, and so we had high-hopes for this good-value smartphone.. The camera was a bit of a disappointment, and although battery life and performance were reasonable, we found the Flyme OS to be a real hurdle. It’s a pretty user interface, but feels somewhat lacking, as many of the Google apps you’ll no doubt be familiar with are absent when you first boot-up the MX6.. As far as build quality goes, the MX6 punches well above its price tag, with a quality screen and metal unibody that is similar in feel to the far-more-expensive iPhone 7 or HTC 10 .. Speaking of these two handsets, Meizu has a lot to thank them for in terms of design, as the MX6 has blatantly borrowed elements from both Apple and HTC phones, and combined them to create a handset that feels like a 2016 wannabe rather than the real deal.. The Meizu MX6 is a great value phone that looks the part – as long as you don’t mind the imitative design. Despite some flaws, it should be on the wish list of anyone looking for a smartphone with speedy performance and a great quality screen, without a flagship price-tag.. The MX6 is very well built and offers a speedy processor, good screen and a novel interface. There are plenty of features and customization options to tinker with, to help adapt the UI to your tastes.. Unfortunately there isn’t much else to recommend, as the camera quality is distinctly average, and other features such as expandable memory and NFC are notably missing.. Ultimately, there are other phones that are not much more expensive yet offer a better all-round package.. We liked the build quality of the Meizu MX6, but this wouldn’t necessarily be our phone of choice. Below we’ve listed three alternatives that you might want to consider.. Though it's a little more expensive, the Nubia Z11 offers a similar iPhone-esque all-metal design to the MX6.. Although we weren’t fans of Nubia’s twist on Android, the Z11 bests the MX6 in a number of key areas: performance, camera and design. Also, where the MX6 screen is just good, the bezel-less screen on the Z11 was a joy to use.. The Nubia Z11 was one of the biggest surprises to come out of China in recent months, and takes some beating.. Motorola's Moto G4 Plus is one of the best value phones around right now, mixing an impressive set of specs with a proper low-end price. The Moto G4 Plus beats any other phone under $250/£200/AU$325, and is genuinely better than quite a few more expensive rivals. The Meizu MX6 is a bit more expensive, but does at least include a fingerprint sensor and a full metal body.. Like the MX6, the Moto G4 Plus has a 5.5-inch Full HD display and powerful chipset, but has a better 16MP main camera that produces admirable results in good lighting.. For less than $250/£200/AU$325, you can’t really go wrong.. The Blu Vivo 6 is similar to the Meizu MX6 in many regards, but is also a fair amount cheaper. It matches the MX6 on just about every specification, and also includes a fingerprint reader.. Although the MX6 has a more powerful deca-core processor, the Blu Vivo 6 bests the MX6 with 64GB of storage capacity, microSD support and 4GB of RAM under the hood.. The Blu Vivo 6 may be something of an unknown, but it’s an all-metal contender that’s only let down by average performance and battery life.. Prev Page Battery life and camera.

Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Meizu MX6 has a deca-core MediaTek Helio X20 processor. The 12-megapixel rear camera uses a Sony IMX36 sensor. The smartphone is priced at roughly Rs 20,500 in China. Chinese smartphone maker Meizu launched its latest smartphone, the MX6, at an event in China yesterday. The company held the event at the China National Conventional Center, where it announced that the smartphone will be available through all partnered online channels immediately, while physical stores will start selling it from July 30.. The Meizu MX6 has an all-metal unibody, with a fingerprint sensor embedded into the home button on the front. It will be available in Grey, Silver, and Gold colour options, and runs Meizu's own Flyme operating system. We spent some time with the new Meizu MX6 smartphone at the launch event, and here are our first impressions.. The Meizu MX6 looks handsome, with a premium feel at the outset. It's lightweight and rests in a palm with ease. The design seems inspired by the iPhone 6s, with antenna bands and a protruding camera ring at the back. The camera, however, is placed in the top centre of the back, with a circular two-tone flash sitting below it. The volume buttons are on the right with the power button right below them, and the dual-SIM tray is on the top left side. MicroSD storage expansion is not supported, so there is no hybrid SIM slot. There are no capacitive buttons alongside the home button or on the screen. Instead, Meizu has integrated all navigation functions button into the home button itself. Tapping this button will take you one step backwards, while physically pressing it will take you back to the home screen. Swiping upwards on the screen will open the app switcher for multi-tasking.. The USB Type-C port, speaker grille, microphone and the 3.5mm audio jack are positioned on the bottom of the device, matching the layout of the iPhone 6s. The home button in the front uses Meizu's M Touch technology, which the company claims is fast, secure, and accurate. In our short time with the device, we found that the fingerprint scanner worked just fine, and did not fall short of expectations.. The Meizu MX6 features a 5.5-inch 1080x1920-pixel LCD display. The screen looks crisp and bright, with minimal reflectiveness under indoor lights. We weren't able to test the device outdoors, so we'll reserve our opinion on that front. At the event, Meizu noted that the MX6 comes with a new Smart Eye Protection mode which automatically adjusts the screen's brightness in different light conditions. There's also a new Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) manufacturing process developed by Sharp to enhance the touchscreen experience. Meizu says it has used a single-layer in-cell panel to achieve the 7.25mm thinness of the MX6.. Meizu's own Flyme 5.1 OS is based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The lock screen on the Meizu MX6 bears a lot of resemblance to the lock screen design of iOS 9. There's a Smart Touch feature which lets users perform gestures to do things like open apps, check notifications, or go back to the home screen. We noticed that there were hardly any preloaded third-party apps, minimising bloat to an extent.. The 12-megapixel camera uses Sony's new IMX368 sensor. It supports slow-motion, GIF, and panorama modes. There are several colour filters within the app, which seem to be inspired by Apple's camera app filters. The photos we were able to take with a Meizu MX6 sample in our short time with it appeared to have great detail and colour, but it is important to note that these photos were taken indoors in ideal lightning conditions. We will reserve our opinion of the camera till we can do a detailed review.. The dual-SIM tray supports two Nano SIM cards, and there is no provision to expand the storage of the Meizu MX6. The smartphone is powered by a deca-core MediaTek Helio X20 processor clocked at 2.3GHz with an integrated ARM Mali-T880 GPU, and 4GB of RAM. We found the device to be responsive, and managed to multi-task seamlessly. There were no visible lags during our brief time with a sample unit. There's a 3060mAh battery with Meizu's 'M charge' fast charging technology, which it claims will charge the smartphone up to 25 percent in just 10 minutes, and up to 65 percent in 30 minutes. The MX6 also offers LTE Cat 6 speeds for cellular data connectivity.. Meizu also launched the Loop Jacket, a flip cover for the MX6, at the same event. This cover has a round opening which offers access to notifications and apps, thanks to Meizu's custom Flyme design, and you can also choose from a variety of round watch faces. You can use several apps like the Camera, Settings, and Phone without opening the cover. The Loop Jacket will sell alongside the MX6 for CNY79 (roughly Rs. Priced at CNY 1,999 (roughly Rs. 20,500 before taxes and duties), the Meizu MX6 could stand tall alongside its competition. It sports a great design, top-end specs, and a seemingly satisfactory camera. The only immediate drawback is the 32GB storage limit, with no option for expansion. However, we hear that Meizu will soon launch a variant with 64GB of storage.. Disclosure: Meizu paid for the correspondent's flights and accommodation for its event in Beijing, China..

Author Sandeep Sarma Posted on August 8, 2016 August 26, 2016 Categories Android , Meizu , Reviews. Meizu MX6 smartphone in silver color. Beautiful Design and Solid Build Quality. Speaker Gets Distorted at High Volumes. "Meizu MX6 Review" , 3 out of 5 based on 35 ratings.. The Meizu MX6 is the successor to the MX5 from last year which was considered to be a great value for money handset with all the bells and whistles. This time around, Meizu has focused on improving the design as well as concentrated on the finer details. Let us take a look at how the device turned out.. Here is the unboxing of the Meizu MX6 .. The MX6 doesn’t really break free from traditional Meizu design. Any angle that you choose to look at the MX6 will only suggest that the smartphone is indeed a Meizu product. Up front, you have the usual mTouch button below the display that remains the only navigation key for the phone as other Meizu phones. The back too is made of metal and you have a design that is very similar to the previous generation MX5 in terms of the visual appeal. However, when it comes to the actual feel and handling, the predecessor and the MX6 are world’s apart.. For starters, the MX6 has a much slimmer body that is not just easier to grasp and handle but also easier to pocket and feels effortless when using it. I couldn’t even recall the MX5 being a bulky smartphone, but when I tried the MX6, the difference was pretty tangible. Despite the reduction in thickness and the smartphone being lighter, the handset doesn’t feel cheap nor does it feel flimsy.. If anything, it feels more premium and robust. After the initial few minutes itself, you can tell that the smartphone is made of premium materials that won’t result in a “bendgate” situation. Most of the front is occupied by the 5.5” display and despite the reduction in the bezels at the sides, the top and bottom bezels are quite big. Below the display is the mTouch button as we explained earlier and above it is the earpiece, front facing camera as well as the ambient light and proximity sensors.. The right side of the device houses the volume rocker button and power key. Both these are well raised and offer great feedback when pressed. There isn’t any sort of engraving or groove that helps differentiate between the two sets of buttons but you will be able to ascertain their positions after spending a few minutes with the device itself. At the left side, near the top, you have the Hybrid DualSIM card slot.. While the top houses just the secondary microphone, things get busy at the bottom with the USB Type-C port, primary microphone, speaker grille and the 3.5mm audio jack. We are quite glad that Meizu didn’t ditch the dedicated audio jack in favour of the “superior” USB Type-C port to transmit audio.. At the back, you have the camera unit as well as a dual-tone LED flash below it. The camera hump too has been reduced compared to the previous generation but it still exists. While it wouldn’t trouble you in your pocket, the hump is pronounced enough to cause scratches if you occasionally place it on rough surfaces. You also get a chrome ring on the outer edge of the camera unit and inner edge of the flash unit. There is a Meizu branding below the camera unit too.. However, possibly the biggest change is perhaps the design of the antenna lines. The MX5 too had what we could call minimal antenna lines and it really didn’t stick out like a sore thumb like it does on some devices (iPhone 6s and 6s Plus included). The MX6 antenna lines are in fact perhaps more prominent compared to the MX5 but it does look more pleasing aesthetically. Rather than having two straight plastic inserts, there is a nice swooping curve to the antenna lines towards the sides of the phone. Sure, this doesn’t seem to be as well implemented as the antenna lines on the upcoming iPhone 7 series and its nowhere as good as the Asus Zenfone 3 which also features a metal unibody design. However, I prefer this look over the MX5 anyday.. The device is pretty easy to handle despite being a 5.5 inch device and is easy to grip too. This is primarily due to the fact that the MX6 has really nice rounded corners and they have also nailed the merge between the glass at the front and the sides. In previous Meizu models, the glass up top was typically flat, then you have a huge chamfered edge around it, which looked good but disrupted the flow and then the sides which stuck out a bit. With the MX6, the front 2.5D curved glass tapers just the perfect amount to merge with the chamfered edge, which in turn merges with the sides. The chamfered edge this time around does what its supposed to by adding visual appeal rather than disrupting the design flow by just being a sharp bezel that runs all around the display.. The soft touch finish of the metal at the back too improves the handling. The back panel is non-removable since this is a unibody design and neither is the battery. The MX6 is available in Silver, Gold, Rose Gold and Grey Variant (Black Glass Up Front).. There’s something about Meizu displays that always stands out and manages to impressive you more and more with each new smartphone they release. I’m not sure if it’s the 2.5D curved glass or the colours/saturation or the viewing angles or brightness or a combination of them all. But the display is definitely beautiful to look at and use. It isn’t a record breaker in terms of pixel density or resolution since it is only a 1080p panel. But the display definitely looks good and you will love using it be it indoors or outdoors. The swipes are really smooth and the 2.5D glass gives a natural flow when using it. The glass is quite resistant to scratches as well and so far we haven’t really gotten any scratches on our unit.. Meizu also gives different options in terms of customization to tweak and get the best experience possible out of the display. Users can adjust the colour temperature to be cooler or warmer based on their preference. Additionally, there is an eye-protective mode which cuts down the amount of blue light emitted by the screen. This would in turn reduce the amount of strain on your eyes and brain. This can either be manually enabled or users can set it from sunset to sunrise or even a custom time slot of their own choice.. The MX6 features a fingerprint sensor on the home button which Meizu likes to call the mTouch key since it relies on a single button navigation method unlike other smartphones. The key is physically clickable and has a nice chamfered inner edge around it. It is sufficiently large too and feels good to rest your finger on it.. The fingerprint sensor is pretty accurate and while it isn’t the fastest on the market, detection and unlock speeds are pretty quick too. The smartphone needs to be woken up in order to unlock the phone so users will either have to press the home button or power key or double tap the display to wake up the phone first before proceeding to use the fingerprint scanner to unlock the phone. The fingerprint scanner also does a good job at recognizing your fingerprint even if your finger is a tad bit dirty but doesn’t do too well in case your finger is wet.. You can and need to setup a backup password, PIN or pattern in order to unlock the device in case the fingerprint scanner fails to recognize your fingerprint. Users can register upto 5 different fingerprints at a time.. The Meizu MX6 comes with Android 6.0 Marhsmallow with Flyme 5.2.2.0G UI on top of it. As with other Meizu smartphones, the MX6 also relies on the single mTouch key to navigate through the phone. A tap on the home button takes you to the previous screen while a physical press of the key takes you to the homescreen. The recent apps screen can be brought up by just swiping upwards from the bottom of the screen.. Just like that, the users get several other gestures to easily access the phone functions. These gestures are both screen off and screen off gestures and some can be customized as per your use cases. There is also a SmartTouch feature that you can enable in order to have a virtual home button of sorts. It can be assigned different functions such as navigating between menus, locking the screen etc. You can also adjust the position as well as the opacity.. You can also choose the bottom layout for the default and 3rd party apps within the settings as well as choose what tapping the home key will do when typing. There is a theme store where users can go to in order to change their wallpapers or the entire look and feel of the UI such as colour palette, icons etc. The toolbox feature has useful tools such as a mirror, magnifier, compass etc. The security centre aims to keep your phone free of viruses and optimise it to perform as smooth as possible.. The MX6 has a nice and large dialpad that is ease to type and use. You can either enter the number directly or search for numbers within your contacts. Call quality is loud enough through both the earpiece and speaker. Thanks to the 2nd noise cancelling mic, your voice is also heard clearly by the party at the other end.. The default keyboard on the MX6 is the TouchPal keyboard which isn’t really my cup of tea. I would rather download and use something like SwiftKey or Google Keyboard since the layout of TouchPal isn’t quite intuitive. Since it is Android, that is luckily very easy to do and despite the keyboard not being so good in terms of layout, typing itself is a pleasurable experience on the MX6 thanks to the smooth screen that curves at the edges.. The MX6 comes with 32GB of on-board storage that is further expandable using microSD cards on the Hybrid DualSIM card slot. It supports 4G LTE as well.. It has a USB Type-C port which also supports USB OTG functionality and additionally also has dual-band WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac as well as Bluetooth 4.1.. The device is powered by a deca-core Helio X20 processor from Mediatek (Dual-core 2.3 GHz Cortex-A72 & quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A53 & quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53) along with 4GB of RAM. Performance is butter smooth as can be expected and the UI is easy to navigate through as well. Where it may fall a bit short is perhaps in terms of gaming performance where it could’ve been better. Here are some of the benchmarks.. For the full fledged results, check out this post .. The MX6 is the first smartphone to use the new Sony IMX 386 sensor. It has a resolution of 12 Megapixels and a sensor size of 1/2.9 inches as well as a pixel size of 1.25 microns. In comparison the MX5 had a larger ½.5” sensor size as well as more pixel count with a resolution of 21 Megapixels. Before we get into the image quality and other aspects, let’s also mention that they have removed Laser Autofocus and that is a good thing.. Click on any of the samples below for the full resolution samples.. Laser Autofocus is a technology that sounds great on paper and is something that companies used to boast about when it came out initially. However, practically speaking, it fails to perform as fast as PDAF and that’s when we aren’t even taking the S7 series into consideration. Laser Autofocus tends to work well only on certain objects or subjects and then again seems to hunt around a bit too much for focus. So just like we were happy to see OnePlus toss it out of the window with the OnePlus 3, we are glad that Meizu removed it on the MX6.. Image quality on the MX6 is pretty good. Photos captured carry plenty of detail and are vibrant with good dynamic range. This is true especially for the HDR mode, which works beautifully well at extracting details from the shadows much better than most other smartphones on the market. It works great in lowlight shots too where the HDR mode makes everything seem more lively and produces a brighter image overall at the expense of a slightly longer shutter speed. The photos on the top are taken in regular mode while the photos below are taken in HDR mode.. But where it falls short is the low light performance and the noise levels. On paper, the sensor seems small to perform well enough under low light conditions and that is the case in real life too. The sensor has a small size along with a small aperture and a pixel size that really isn’t all that impressive, the low light performance is underwhelming. The images are mostly under exposed and if you want a bright image you’ll have to use the HDR mode. That improves the exposure and makes the image a whole lot more lively. However, there is still a lot of noise and the longer shutter speed leads to object or subject blurring at times.. The camera UI is really simple but functional. When held horizontally, the shutter key, gallery preview and mode shortcuts are there on the right size. The shutter key also has a built in level that makes it easier to get the right composition. Users can also enable a photo grid to assist in composing your shots. On the left side, you have the toggles for flash, timer, filters, camera switch and settings. The camera app also supports HDR, manual metering and can be set to add a time mark as well as location if you wish. The different modes available are auto, manual, video, beauty, panorama, light field, slow-mo, scan, macro and gif.. Manual allows users to choose the shutter speed, ISO, focus, exposure compensation, saturation, contrast and white balance. Gif takes videos and saves them in a .gif format while scan is a built-in QR code reader. Light field allows you to change the point of focus after the photo has been taken. The rest of the modes are pretty much self-explanatory.. The Meizu MX6 offers a loud output when it comes to the speaker. Loud is a relative term and while it does perform much better than the majority of smartphones. It is slightly let down by the tiny distortion at the highest volume levels. Audio quality over the earphones are decent but not flagship grade. The output is quite loud though and we suggest increase it as per your need since it can go very high.. The music player is simple but good enough for the average listener. It comes with different ways to sort your collection based on the track name, album, artist, playlist etc. The now playing screen has the album art, track controls, favourite and shuffle/repeat buttons too.. The Meizu MX6 comes with a non-removable 3060 mAh battery which also supports fast charging through its. We are currently performing our battery tests on the MX6 and will soon be back with the results.. The Meizu MX6 is a pretty good smartphone at the price point 1999 Yuan (US$298 / Rs. However, I am not sure whether I would recommend it over competitors such as the OnePlus 3 for example. Sure, the OnePlus 3 is costlier and the Meizu MX6 has many things that the OnePlus 3 has but the latter also has several things that the MX6 doesn’t have and that justifies the extra asking price. The MX6 is a good all rounder of a smartphone but it doesn’t really offer something unique or stand out from the rest of the crowd. The MX6 doesn’t have a lot of negatives but it doesn’t have really impressive positives either. Not to mention the fact that the device is also currently available only in China and if people want to get it, it would involve purchasing it and importing. To be honest, I don’t feel its worth all that effort. If and when they do release it locally and say sub 20k, then its perhaps a proposition worth looking at..

Hot on the heels of the Huawei P9 , the Meizu MX6 is the next Chinese-designed smartphone to land on our teardown table. At first glance, this iPhone look-alike is making us see double! The MX6 couldn’t be the long lost twin to the iPhone, could it? Let’s get this teardown started and find out.. Stay up to date on the latest repair news, and get a behind-the-scenes look at where the teardown magic happens by following us on Facebook , Instagram , or Twitter .. This teardown is not a repair guide. To repair your Meizu MX6, use our service manual .. On the outside, the MX6 walks the iPhone walk, but does it talk the talk? Here's what we know so far:. 10 cores! ) CPU w/ ARM Mali-T880 GPU. 4 GB LPDDR3 RAM and 32 GB of storage. 5.5-inch, 1080p high-precision display (~401 ppi). 12 MP ƒ/2.0 main camera w/ 1.25 μm pixels and 5 MP front-facing camera. Flyme OS 5.2 over Android 6.0 Marshmallow. 3,060 mAh battery with 24 W fast charging. USB-C port, Dual SIM support, and Meizu mTouch fingerprint sensor. It's a three-phone pile-up as we pull over to take a cursory look at how the MX6 compares to its iPhone idols.. A quick comparison reveals...not a whole lot. Apart from the USB-C connector and a slightly shifted microphone port, we're hard pressed to distinguish the MX6 from its Cupertino-based counterparts.. Aside from the oval home button and different side button configuration, the MX6 fits right into the iPhone lineup—what with its metal unibody design and 2.5D glass panel .. The MX6 differentiates itself with a centered rear camera and dual flash assembly, but those subtle antenna bands are reminiscent of certain iPhone 7 rumors .. Like the Huawei P9 , the MX6 seems inspired by the iPhone in more than just looks: two Pentalobe screws secure the MX6's display assembly to the chassis.. We're still baffled as to why manufacturers would copy Apple's screw design, when a regular ol' Phillips or Torx screw does the same job better with less hassle.. Ruh Roh, Raggy! We also find a fingerprint reader cable booby trap like in the iPhone 5s/SE!. Not to worry, Scooby Doo— Meizu cut us some slack (literally), so the cable is unlikely to rip when opening the phone.. The cable's connector lies under a screwed-down, tamper-evident bracket that's arguably simpler than Apple's awful spring clip .. Before diving in, we pause to disconnect the battery; its small connector releases with a flip of the spudger. With the MX6 safely de-electrified, we pop the display cable free and peer inside.. First observation: Phillips screws— everywhere! A small celebration breaks out around the teardown table.. Second observation: Looks like the iPhone mold is mostly skin-deep, look at that big ol' battery.!We just can't wait to dig in.. Interestingly, the display's perimeter is all plastic, including its clips and edges. This may be a durability concern, but there's no risk of display bracket separation .. Out comes the bracket securing the fingerprint sensor—followed by the sensor itself, with its long switchback cable in tow.. This display assembly is a much simpler affair than you'll find in a comparable iPhone (or Android phone!), thanks to some handy spring contacts and a motherboard-mounted front-facing camera.. That means a cheaper, simpler repair!. Fix Kits starting at $16.99. With the display assembly out of the way, we carefully excavate the MX6's stubbornly-adhered battery. Luckily, the battery features an iPhone 4-esque battery pull tab that makes the job a bit easier.. The MX6 packs a non-user-removable, 3.8 V, 11.63 Wh Li-poly battery.. This puts the MX6's battery ahead in the power struggle, topping the iPhone 6s Plus 's 10.45 Wh battery, and just barely surpassing the Samsung Galaxy S7 's 11.55 Wh battery.. Meizu claims that their mCharge 24 W (12 V at 2 A) fast charging technology will fully charge the MX6's battery in only 75 minutes, compared to 90 minutes for the Galaxy S7.. Next to come out? The speaker assembly, complete with spring contacts and what appears to be an antenna sticker of some kind.. Part of the assembly lines up with the lower microphone hole—but if you go looking for a mic here, you'll be disappointed!. This assembly has a tiny acoustic tube channel with a 90-degree bend, passing sound from the outside world to a mic located elsewhere.... "Elsewhere" turns out to be a combined USB-C, headphone jack, and microphone assembly—which we dutifully peel out of the chassis of the MX6.. A small amount of adhesive secures the cable to the chassis, but it presents no problem for our teardown engineer.. Upon inspection, we find antenna connections on the bottom of the cable, as well as on the bottom of the motherboard.. Manufacturers seem to be in competition to cram as much as they possibly can onto the charging port cable. (Which means a pricier repair when your port eventually gets loose.). With tweezers in hand, we deftly pluck out several bits 'n pieces:. With those bits out of the way, we lift the motherboard out and get a closer look at the cameras.. The rear-facing camera features Sony's 12 MP Exmor RS IMX386 CMOS image sensor along with a 6-element ƒ/2.0 lens, while the front-facing camera features a 5 MP sensor with a 4-element ƒ/2.0 lens.. With the motherboard plucked from the the rear case, we take a second to explore the MX6's silicon situation. Micron D9TPL 32 Gb (4 GB) Mobile LPDDR3 SDRAM with MediaTek Helio X20 SoC layered underneath. MediaTek MT6631N Wi-Fi Module. Texas Instruments BQ25892 Fast Charging IC. NXP TFA9911 Audio Amplifier. MediaTek MT6300P (Possibly an iteration of the MT6302 dual SIM card controller). Toshiba THGBMHG8C4LBAIR 32 GB eMMC 5.1 NAND Flash. Texas Instruments LM36272 LCD Backlight Driver. Texas Instruments BQ25892 Fast Charging IC. Dialog Semiconductor DA9214 PMIC. MediaTek MT6176V RF Transciever. Skyworks SKY13596-397LF RF Switch. Skyworks SKY77916-31 RF PAM. The final few pickings come from the MX6's chassis.. We pry out the (tiny!) rotational vibrator motor. It's different from the linear oscillating motors and "Taptic Engines" used in many ( not all ) iPhone models, but also takes less space.. The chassis itself is peppered with spring contacts, which no doubt made our teardown journey that much easier.. Though the exterior design looks undeniably iPhone-esque, the hardware layout calls to mind another recent Android hit from China .. And that's a wrap! Time to give this phone a score.. The display assembly is the first component out, simplifying screen repairs. Modular components with spring contacts, large screws, and thoughtful cabling all make repair cheaper and easier. The battery is equipped with a pull-tab for removal, but tough adhesive means lots of force is needed to remove it. The MX6 uses Pentalobe security screws on the exterior, requiring a specialty screwdriver to open the phone before any repair.. Repairability 7 out of 10. that phone looks like the OnePlus 3 and iPhone 6 had a child. The overall design is very smart.
