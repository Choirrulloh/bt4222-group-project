The manufacturer says that the Moto E's 2800mAh battery will last a full day. The camera combo has also been greatly improved from last year. Instead of a 5MP camera in back with a .3MP selfie shooter, the Moto E3 is equipped with an 8MP camera in back and a 5MP snapper in front. Dimensions: 5.66 x 2.82 x 0.33 inches (143.8 x 71.6 x 8.5 mm). Weight: 4.96 oz (141 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Oleophobic coating, Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 3), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. Quad-core, 1000 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 20.

Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Motorola's back with a new budget contender. Cut to the chase What is it? Motorola's cheap champion When is it out? Early September What will it cost? £99 (around US$130, AU$170) Moto E3 release date and price Moto E3 design and screen Moto E3 camera and battery Moto E3 OS and power The Moto E isn't the only compellingly cheap handset. The launch of the Moto Z range hasn't meant Motorola has abandoned its affordable Moto E line, in fact the company has just announced the third entry in the series, dubbed the Moto E3.. On paper it sounds like the new Moto E will continue in the footsteps of the Moto E (2015) , with a rock bottom price and surprisingly solid specs.. Here's everything you need to know about it, from what it will cost and when you can get it, to the specs and features.. Motorola is launching the Moto E3 in early September. In the UK it will cost you £99 (around US$130, AU$170) and the handset will be available from Tesco, Amazon, Argos, O2 and other selected retailers.. There's no news yet on the price or release date elsewhere, but we'd imagine it will launch at around the same time in other countries.. The Moto E3 has a base color of black or white and a fairly plain back, with the usual Motorola dimple. It looks very similar to the Moto E (2015), albeit with a different camera design.. It comes in at 143.8 x 71.6 x 8.55mm, making it quite a lot longer and wider but substantially slimmer than the 129.9 x 66.8 x 12.3mm Moto E (2015). It's slightly lighter too at 140.6g.. The Moto E3 is also splashproof, with a nano-coating creating a water repellent barrier, helping it survive spills and light splashes. But this isn't full waterproofing we're talking about, so don't take it swimming with you.. The new Moto E packs a 5.0-inch 720 x 1280 display with a pixel density of 294 pixels per inch. That's up from a 4.5-inch 540 x 960 screen on the Moto E (2015). It also has a built-in smudge-resistant screen protector, to help it keep clear of fingerprints.. Motorola has stuck an 8MP camera on the back of the new Moto E, with an LED flash and video recording at up to 720p. There's also a 5MP snapper on the front and while there's no flash on this one it does come with a 'Beautification mode', to keep selfie fiends happy.. That's a big upgrade on the 5MP/VGA pairing on the Moto E (2015), especially as there was no flash present there.. The battery is a 2800mAh one, which according to Motorola will last a full day of mixed use. It sounds like you'll still need to put it through daily charges, but it's a lot larger than the 2390mAh one in the Moto E (2015).. The Moto E3 has a 1.0GHz quad-core 64-bit MediaTek MT6735p processor and 1GB of RAM, which doesn't sound like much of an upgrade on last year's model, as that also had a quad-core chip and 1GB of RAM.. But the Moto E3 runs Android Marshmallow, supports 4G and has a microSD card slot to boost the internal memory (which stands at 8GB). Cards are capped at 32GB though, so you can't turn this into a 256GB monster.. The best iPhone apps to download in 2018. STK X2 offers up Samsung looks for a fraction of the price.

CNET también está disponible en español.. Moto E3 mixes water resistance and Android Marshmallow with rock-bottom price. The dirt-cheap handset has a 5-inch display, quad-core processor and won't cut out when you spill beer on it.. by July 14, 2016 4:47 AM PDT. I recently called Motorola's new Moto G4 an "unbeatable Android bargain", and already Motorola is trying to outdo itself with an even cheaper phone -- the new Moto E3. will sell in the UK for only £99, making it about £70 cheaper than the G4. US and Australian pricing and availability isn't yet known, but that £99 price converts to roughly $130 and AU$175. We'll update this article with more pricing information when it's available.. So it's extremely cheap, but it doesn't appear to have made the sacrifices we often see in the budget end of the market. It has a 5-inch, 720p display, a quad-core processor, an 8-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel camera on the front.. runs the recent Android Marshmallow and has a microSD card slot to expand its storage, though Motorola hasn't said how much it has built in. Best of all though is that it's water-resistant like the G4. You can't submerge it in water, but it will happily put up with a spilled drink or two.. I'm yet to see the phone in the flesh, so I'll reserve my final judgement on this cut-down handset for the full review.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

Moto E3 Review, Price and Specifications. Motorola just outed its new Moto E3, which follows the same evolution pattern as this year's Moto G4/ G4 Plus. The new affordable Moto E3 looks identical to the G4 or G4 Plus from the rear side. On the front, it has an extra slit below its 5-inch HD display, which might purely be for aesthetic reasons for all we know. The display also comes with a "built-in smudge-resistant screen protector," which again feels like a dubious marketing term. On the inside, the Moto E3 has a quad-core processor (details unspecified) backed by 1GB RAM and 8GB internal storage. That certainly doesn't sound like much in 2016. A MicoSD card slot might offer some consolation for basic users. In line with Moto traditions, the new E3 is running latest Android Marshmallow software out of the box, and might very well receive Android N update later. Other features include a 2800 mAh battery, 8MP rear camera, and a 5MP selfie shooter. Going by the exchange rates and UK price of 100 Pounds, the Moto E3 is expected to retail for around 9K in India. It doesn't seem very likely that Motorola Moto E3 price in India will be the same as the one on the UK variant. As you can see, a handful of variables are still unknown and we will have a clearer insight on the new Moto E once its goes official in India, which is likely to happen in late August or September 2016. A lot can change in a month.. Attractive design Almost stock Android Marshmallow software. Only 8GB storage Only 1GB RAM. good quality and powerful batery backup ...use contineous 2 days..

Press enter or click on the search icon. So much tech for your cash. A Moto G4 downgrade in some ways. Even though it’s been on the market for nearly a year, and will likely see a replacement in the form of a Moto G6 at MWC 2018 , the Moto G5 is still a fantastic device.. It does, however, make the least impact of just about any Moto G to date, though, so if you find a Moto G4 at a bargain price you should consider that too. There’s little progress here, and a few minor downgrades.. Don’t feel the need to hesitate if you just want a good phone you can pick up on the high street and can’t find the Moto G4 anymore, though.. This is our review of the 2017 Moto G5, for the Moto G4 review skip to the final page.. If you’re new to the Moto G series, the Moto G5 is a perfectly inoffensive, pleasant looking phone with some elements that give it a touch of class. For those already familiar with this phone family, there are some important changes.. The Moto G5 is a much smaller phone than the Moto G4 , because it has a 5-inch screen rather than a 5.5-inch one. It’s much closer to the size of the old Moto G3. I had a chance to compare the two directly, and the Moto G5 is actually a bit wider, but slightly slimmer.. That extra width is what stops the Moto G5 from seeming like a phone radically more expensive than its price: bulk means ‘budget’. Those bits of screen surround are rather chunky, and highlighted by the chromed outline.. These chrome bits characterise what Lenovo has tried to do with the series, to glam it up a bit. To date all Moto G phones have been almost relentlessly practical, mostly-plastic and wallflower-like, but the Moto G5 has a lot more metal on show.. The main panel on the back is aluminium, but this is not a metal unibody phone. Pull off the removable back to investigate and you’ll find the metal is actually just a sliver of aluminium locked into a plastic frame. Realising this is slightly disappointing when companies like Honor and Huawei make affordable phones where metal dominates more.. That said, Lenovo has styled-out the design well. The curves between the metal and plastic parts look good, as does the contrast between the black camera circle and the silver or gold back. It may not really be the radical build upgrade it seems, but the style is much more deliberate. Older Moto Gs look plain in comparison, although like many I have a lot of affection for the no-nonsense style of the first three Moto G generations..

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. I’d recommend getting a case for the Moto G5 as after a few weeks of use I’ve managed to put a few scratches in the aluminium and a couple of nicks in the chrome screen border. The parts likely to wear the best are the glass on the front and the plastic on the sides. Beneath the screen is a very good fingerprint scanner. As standard it’s not used as a Home button, but dig into the Moto app and you can make it replace all the home keys. Swipe left for ‘back’, right for ‘recent apps’ and a tap for Home: it works well. It’s also much prettier than the Moto G4 Plus’s ugly scanner, too.. There’s no NFC, so you can’t use Android Pay, which lets you use a phone like a contactless debit card. The Moto G5 also uses a microUSB rather than the newer USB-C, which over the last six months has become the norm for new phones. It dates the G5 a little, but for most people it ultimately doesn’t matter.. Fast charging doesn’t rely on USB-C (this phone has fast-ish charging) and USB-C doesn’t even guarantee super-fast file transfers. The main benefit in budget phones is being able to jam the plug in either way. The Moto G5 has 16GB of internal storage, which is as much as you could expect at the price, and has a microSD slot. You can also remove the battery, a rarity these days. I tend to recommend investing in an external battery rather than spares for your phone, but many of our readers love the idea of being able to replace the cell when it starts losing capacity two years down the line.. The Moto G5 has a 5-inch screen. That’s a good size for just about anything, from reading articles to playing games and watching Netflix, without the pocket bulge of a 5.5-inch display like the Moto G4’s.. Its specs are perfect for the money, with 1080p resolution where the older Moto G generations with this size of screen used 720p panels. It’s sharper than an iPhone 7 , with the same number of pixels as the iPhone 7 Plus. On first turning the Moto G5 on, I could tell it doesn’t quite have the depth of colour as, say, a £500 phone. However, the undersaturation is very, very slight and I stopped noticing it within a few hours.. There are actually two different colour modes, Standard and Vibrant, and if you use the latter the Moto G5 doesn’t look too far off a phone twice the price or more. ‘Standard’ is an sRGB-like mode, giving a relaxed look, but I think most people prefer the punchier mode.. The IPS LCD doesn’t have contrast or black level of an OLED, but only display obsessives and those that regularly watch Netflix in bed with the lights off will notice much. I’d be happy to live with this display, even if I had a top-end phone lying around waiting to be used.. Viewing angles are great, with only minor brightness drop-off at an angle and brightness is good enough to cope with outdoors use. Is it a downgrade from the Moto G4? It’s smaller and slightly less bright, but I’d put them in the same class. It’s also on-par with some phones well over £200.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network. 
Motorola Moto E3 (2016) in a nutshell: Specs, UK price and release date. What is the Motorola Moto E3?. What are the Motorola Moto E3’s specs?. What are the Motorola Moto E3’s main rivals?. What is the Motorola Moto E3’s UK price and release date?. Motorola’s Moto E3 is a fresh new Moto E-series handset for 2016, featuring some impressive specs and features at a super-budget price. Here’s all you need to know about the Moto E3, including UK specs, price and release date.. In March 2015, Motorola launched the awesome Moto E 4G , a £100 smartphone that seriously impressed us with its solid specs and dependable performance despite its wallet-friendly asking price. In fact, the Moto E 4G is still one of the best budget mobiles thar you can buy.. Or at least, it was one of the best budget blowers. Because Mottorola has just refreshed the Moto E range for 2016 with the all-new Moto E3, which continues the theme of super specs and features at an affordable price point. The Moto E3 is an Android handset. for anyone who wants a dependable smartphone experience (fast web browsing, a means of watching video and so on) without splashing out £20 or more on a monthly contract.. The Moto E3 is a 5-inch 4G phone that runs Android Marshmallow, the latest version of Google’s Android OS (although Android Nougat should be released globally in the next couple of months). That spacious screen is more compact than the Moto G4 ‘s whopping 5.5-inch display, but still boasts a 720p HD resolution to keep images crisp.. There’s a quad-core processor (chipset unknown) stuffed inside the Moto E3, along with a good-sized 2800mAh battery. And while there’s limited built-in storage, the Moto E3 does have a microSD memory card slot to add in extra space. You also get an 8-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, both with autofocus. the Moto E3 isn’t fully water resistant, it is ‘splash proof’ to avoid rain damage.. Read next: Moto E3 vs Moto G4 Play vs Moto G4 vs Moto G4 Plus, specs comparison. We’ve seen a few other sub-£100 smartphones already launched in 2016, although only the Vodafone Smart Prime 7 has really impressed us with its excellent all-round experience. For instance, the £89 Wileyfox Spark is troubled by terrible performance, which makes it a frustrating mobile for everyday use.. We’re expecting the Moto E3 to therefore make a serious impact when it’s officially released, especially as it has none of the carrier branding restrictions of the Smart Prime 7.. will be available to buy in the UK from early September, for £99. You’ll be able to buy the Moto E3. from Tesco, Amazon, Argos, O2 and other selected UK retailers, as well as direct from Motorola.. Moto E4 launches: Specs, UK price and release date.

Lenovo-owned Motorola has launched several phones this year, hitting a range of price points. The Moto Z aims for the higher end of the market, the Moto G falls towards to lower end of the mid-range, while the latest Moto E continues to fulfill the budget sector.. How does the Moto E3 compare to last year's model though and do you get more for your £100 this time around?. We have put 2016's Moto E3 up against 2015's second generation of Moto E to see what the differences are and how much has changed.. The Motorola Moto E3 takes its design cues from the Moto G4. It has a slim body that measures 8.6mm, a front-facing speaker at the bottom and the rear has a camera lens and LED flash housed in the same raised element.. The signature indented "M" is also present beneath the camera and flash array. The Moto E3 has a footprint of 143.8 x 71.6mm and hits the scales at 141g.. The Motorola Moto E second generation is a little bulkier than the latest model, measuring 12.3mm at its thickest point, but it is smaller at 129.9 x 66.8mm. It weighs 145g so it is slightly heavier than the new Moto E.. The rear features a larger camera lens, still centralised like the new Moto E, but there is no LED flash. The signature indented "M" sits in the same place, while the front has one speaker at the top, but not the bottom.. The Motorola Moto E3 has a 5-inch display that is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. It is an IPS LCD display and it has a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels, which results in a pixel density of 294ppi.. The 2015 Moto E has a slightly smaller 4.5-inch display, which is the same size as the Moto G when it originally launched. It too is an IPS LCD screen and it is also protected by Gorilla Glass 3.. The resolution on the second generation of Moto E is 960 x 540 pixels, which results in a pixel density of 245ppi. That means the new Moto E does theoretically have a sharper display than its predecessor, but the difference is pretty minor because of the size increase and won't be noticeable to the human eye.. The Moto E3 features an 8-megapixel rear camera, with an LED flash as we mentioned, coupled with a 5-megapixel front-facing camera.. The rear will be capable of 720p video recording and it will offer features including burst mode, HDR and panorama.. The second generation of Moto E has a 5-megapixel rear camera with an aperture of f/2.2. It doesn't offer a flash of any kind but the LTE model is. The front-facing camera on 2015's model of Moto E is VGA, which means the new model should offer significant improvements when it comes to selfies and video calling.. The Motorola Moto E3 features a quad-core 1GHz MediaTek processor, along with 1GB of RAM, 8GB of internal storage, microSD expansion up to 32GB and a battery capacity of 2800mAh.. Last year's Moto E features a quad-core 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor and 1GB within the LTE model. It also comes with 8GB of internal storage and microSD support for storage expansion up to 32GB.. The 2015 Moto E has a battery capacity of 2390mAh so the new Moto E should last a little longer, although it does have a larger screen to power.. The Moto E3 launches on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and features very little bloatware over the top, delivering an almost pure Android experience. It will no doubt see an update to Android Nougat shortly after the software launches officially towards the end of September.. The previous Moto E originally launched on Android Lollipop, but it has since been updated to Marshmallow. It too has very little bloatware meaning quick software updates. It isn't yet clear if it will be updated to Nougat though.. The Motorola Moto E3 sees some quite significant developments over the second generation. The design has improved, the display is larger and offers a higher resolution and the battery capacity has also increased.. The Moto E3 also sees some good developments in the camera department including the addition of a rear flash and an increase in resolution, the latter of which should be especially noticeable in the front-facing snapper.. You get quite a bit for your £100 with the Moto E3. For those choosing between the two devices being compared here, the new model is definitely the one to opt for. For those considering moving from last year's model to the Moto E3, there certainly appears to be plenty to warrant the upgrade..
