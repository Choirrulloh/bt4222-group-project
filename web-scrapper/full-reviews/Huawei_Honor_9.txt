CNET también está disponible en español.. Huawei's Honor 9 wants to take out the OnePlus 5. A portrait mode for selfies gives the midprice Honor 9 a little something extra.. by June 27, 2017 6:00 AM PDT. Honor 9 specs versus OnePlus 5. Huawei Honor 9 doubles your camera for less. With the Honor 9 , Huawei throws down the gauntlet against the OnePlus 5 ( $949.98 at Amazon.com ). Both are dual-camera Android phones you can buy for a smaller chunk of change than a premium flagship like the Galaxy S8 ( $597.42 at Amazon.com ) .. The Honor 9 is going after the same sweet spots as the OnePlus 5 -- good photos, a top-of-the-line processor, and amenities like lots of onboard storage and a second SIM card slot.. third-largest phone maker , but it's failed to become the global household name that Samsung and Apple have, and cedes some ground to phones by the likes of OnePlus, whose OnePlus 5 was good enough to earn CNET's Editor's Choice Award for its high value. The Honor line gives Huawei an important opportunity to get its phones in front of buyers who could be interested in the OnePlus 5.. The Honor 9 I got to play with was fast, with a seriously speedy fingerprint reader and a glorious deep blue finish (it also comes in grey and black). The phone felt smooth in my hand, and much smaller and more manageable than a hulk like the iPhone 7 Plus ( $891.02 at Amazon.com ) or Google Pixel XL ( $499.00 at Amazon.com ). Its glossiness makes it a little slip-prone without a case.. See the gorgeous blue Honor 9. Its dual rear cameras are a talking point: You get a 12-megapixel RGB lens for full color, and an additional 20-megapixel monochrome lens. That's mainly there to add depth and nuance to photos. It's worked well in previous Huawei phones, but we'll still need to thoroughly test it before we can say just how good these photos are.. You will find plenty of settings, including a digital portrait mode for both front and rear cameras (that's right, you can get the Bokeh bur effect on your selfies). There are also manual settings for photos and videos, and support for RAW files (with pro mode).. One difference between last year's wonderful Honor 8 ( $329.00 at Amazon.com ) and this year's Honor 9 is that the fingerprint reader moved. It used to be on the phone's rear and corresponded to a programmable button you could set to, for example, launch the screen. Now it's on the phone face beneath the screen, is static, and doesn't have a custom button. Long press this new home button to pull up Google search -- strangely, my test model didn't have Google Assistant incorporated.. The Honor 9 is already on sale in China and will sell in select markets globally. It's up for preorder in the UK today on Amazon for £380, and will be available exclusively on the Three network for £16 per month on a 24-month contract.. Don't expect to see an Honor 9 for the US, at least not yet. But there's a good chance that will change down the line. After all, the Honor 8 was launched in San Francisco last year, and sells through Huawei's site HiHonor.com. And Huawei sort-of-not-really hints as much. "Later this year, you can expect to hear more about new devices that will be available in the US," the company said in a statement.. See how the Honor 9's specs compare to the OnePlus 5 in the chart below.. Huawei Kirin 960, Octa-Core (4x2.4 GHz+4x1.8 GHz). 4GB or 6GB (varies by region). Portrait mode, notifications toggle, dual-SIM, Dash Charging. Converts to $397 (from Chinese yuan). Converts to £314 (from Chinese yuan). Converts to AU$527 (from Chinese yuan).

[13] Android Authority's Gary Sims gave the phone a rating of 8.7 out of 10, and wrote in his review summary: "The Honor 9 certainly ticks a lot of the right boxes: great performance, dual cameras, sleek design, and an IR blaster! The only downsides are the lack of toughened glass over the display and the slippery nature of the build materials."

[17] Preston's summary read, "The Honor 9 is an undeniably impressive phone for an unmatched price right now. In performance terms, it's nipping at the heels of the year's top flagships, and only lacking flashy features like waterproofing or a bezel-less screen. It looks great, it runs fast, and it costs less than £400. We're sold." [16] Summarizing his review, Peckham wrote, "The Honor 9 offers a lot of what the high-end flagship phones do right now, but for a much lower price. There's no exciting, headline-grabbing feature here, but a great design, fantastic performance and lots of nice touches make this an all-round impressive and affordable phone." [4] Vogel also gave a rating of 8.9 on a 10-point scale, meaning "outstanding". Android Central's Alex Dobie called the Honor 9 the "best phone for less than £400".

A beautiful blue bargain, the Honor 9 embarrasses the competition with its cool camera and flashy design.. A beautiful blue bargain, the Honor 9 embarrasses the competition with its cool camera and flashy design.. A camera you’ll want to use. Geekbench 4: 1,873 single-core, 6,713 multi-core. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. Everyone loves a bargain, and the Honor 9 smartphone is exactly that. It does everything phones costing $150 more can do, while looking as good, if not better than most. The Honor 9 is Honor outdoing OnePlus , a company that’s a master in offering an affordable phone with high-end specifications. In our Honor 9 review, we explain how it manages this feat.. Before we dive in, you should know that Honor is a subsidiary of Huawei , a major Chinese smartphone manufacturer with high-end phones such as the Huawei P10 ,. as well as the highly-anticipated Huawei Mate 10 .. It’s the wonderfully crafted 3D glass rear that defines the Honor 9’s look. Created using 15 layers of glass, a thermal bending process, and intricate nano textures in a mold that’s replaced every 500 uses; the glassy, reflective panel captures light in a gloriously eye-catching way you’ll never get bored of seeing. Yes, it attracts fingerprints in the same way it catches light, and it’s sure to smash if you drop it on a hard surface. But it doesn’t matter — it’s beautiful.. The 7.5mm thick body holds a 5.1-inch screen, and weighs 155 grams, making it compact and comfortable to hold in one hand. The fingerprint sensor is below the screen, and it’s the worst part of the design as you have to shift the phone’s position to use it — not good with a slippery phone. We would have preferred a rear sensor. On the back are two camera lenses, which are flush with the Gorilla Glass 3 panel, just like on the Honor 9’s close cousin, the Huawei P10. It’s the wonderfully crafted 3D glass rear cover that defines the Honor 9’s look.. A 3.5mm headphone jack is on the phone’s base, along with a speaker and the USB Type-C charging port. On the side is the sleep/wake key and volume controls. It’s here that you see the differences between the Honor 9 and more expensive devices. The OnePlus 5 and the Huawei P10 have textured sleep/wake keys to make them easier to find without looking; but it’s smooth on the Honor 9. Not a big deal, but the differences are there. It’s also slightly heavier and thicker than the P10, but not by margins you’d really notice.. The Honor 9 is phone design done right, except for one thing. It has a mind of its own, and will for seemingly no reason slide off even the flattest, most level surfaces. Please, put the Honor 9 in a case, otherwise its slippery nature will see it crash to the floor when you least expect it.. The Honor 9 has a dual-lens camera similar in ability to the one on Huawei phones and the Nokia 8 , with a 12-megapixel color lens and a 20-megapixel monochrome lens. Used together they create detailed images, letting you access 2x optical zoom for close up shots, and they can produce a blurred background for portraits (like on the iPhone 8 Plus). The difference between the Honor 9 and the Huawei P10 is the lack of Leica lenses and camera tuning.. We like the Huawei P10’s camera , and feel the same about the Honor 9. It’s a camera you’ll want to use, and it takes fabulous pictures. The interface is fast, the shutter release acts instantly, and the software suite for editing is comprehensive and easy to use. Slide in the menu tray from the side and there are various modes to select, including a manual mode, panorama, HDR, night shot, light painting, and our personal favourite: Monochrome.. A great camera, with a coherent interface, and sensibly thought out features.. If all you’ve used are monochrome filters, then the dedicated monochrome lens will be a revelation. The detail it reproduces is stunning, adding mood and drama to otherwise normal pictures. The wide aperture mode to blur out backgrounds is also effective, and the focal point can be changed after you’ve taken the picture. It’s good at recognizing edges, and isolating what you want to focus on from the background, but not perfect. The images it creates are great for sharing online.. Portrait mode, used for taking great pictures of people, is excellent. It goes a step beyond a beauty mode by adding a bokeh effect to pictures of people, enhancing them with a beauty effect. It operates on both the front and the rear camera, so it’s perfect for selfie fans. The Beauty mode can look a little weird though, as it really changes the way you look, from smoothing out skin to brightening and enlarging eyes.. Huawei Honor 9 Compared To. Put all these things together, and you’ve got a camera you want to use. The Honor 9 encourages you to go out and experiment with photography. This is a great camera, with a coherent interface, and sensibly thought out features. Downsides? There’s no optical image stabilization, which makes low-light shots look poor unless you use a tripod.. Inside the Honor 9 is a Kirin 960 octa-core processor with 4GB of RAM, which is the same setup as the Huawei P10. The operating system is Android 7.0 Nougat with Huawei’s EMUI 5.1 interface over the top. Huawei shares certain technology with Honor, such as the processor and software, but as we mentioned earlier Honor is a subsidiary of Huawei, and it should be treated as a separate company targeting younger, tech-savvy buyers.. The EMUI 5.1 interface is different to stock Android. You can add an app drawer, but it’s disabled as standard, there are alterations to app icons and the notification shade, plus a few tweaks to the settings menu. A selection of pre-installed apps are there, but can be deleted. It’s way better than it used to be, and Huawei has made a concerted effort to speed things up, not just in the amount of taps it takes to reach a function, but also in the way the operating system optimizes itself over time. In other words, it’ll remain speedy even after many months of use.. Running several benchmark apps, these are the scores the Honor 9 achieved.. They are comparable to the Huawei P10, unsurprisingly, but below the OnePlus 5. However, we never experienced any annoying slow down in normal, everyday operation. The Honor 9 is fast enough for most.. The battery has a 3,200mAh capacity and supports fast charging, adding 40-percent in just 30 minutes. To get this performance, you will have to use the included Honor charger. We found the battery to be easily enough to last a day, but not enough to last two. You’ll have to charge the Honor 9 daily if you want it to last continuously.. The 5.1-inch LCD screen has a 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution. It’s bright, sharp, and videos look excellent. The standard speaker is good too, and we enjoyed watching several TV show episodes on the phone, despite its small size. Don’t be put off by the Honor 9 not having a higher resolution, it wouldn’t make much difference on a screen this size.. preceded the Honor 9 and was well-received in the U.S., but at the time of writing, Honor hasn’t announced the Honor 9 officially in North America. It’s priced at 380 British pounds, which is about $500. Although it’s possible to buy imported models from Amazon, you’ll have to make do with 3G data speeds in the U.S., on GSM networks from AT&T and T-Mobile.. Buy an Honor 9 in the U.K. through the official Vmall online store or Amazon , and the company gives a two-year warranty on the handset, six months for the battery and charger, and three months for the earphones. It’s a repair-or-replace service, and requires the device to visit a Huawei service center.. Why pay more for a flagship cameraphone, when the Honor 9 takes pictures just as well, sometimes even better, for less? That’s before seeing the great looking screen, and swooning over the stunning design. release, and we’ll be very happy indeed.. There are several alternatives to the Honor 9 worth considering. The newly announced Motorola Moto X4. has a dual-lens camera, a slick design, almost standard Android and some features the Honor 9 doesn’t have, like water resistance and Amazon Alexa. It’s $400 in the U.S., and 350 British pounds , slightly undercutting the Honor 9.. shouldn’t be dismissed either, and remains a bargain buy at 450 British pounds, or $480. If these are too expensive, we also like the less powerful LG Q6 , with its wide 18:9 aspect ratio screen, that sells for 250 British pounds in the U.K. is less than $300, and is a great — if ugly — Android phone.. There is plenty of competition. for the Honor 9, so don’t rush into a decision. The Honor 9 isn’t especially durable. It doesn’t have water resistance, and the body is made from glass. It will be very easy to break if you don’t treat it with respect. We highly recommend putting it in a case.. Honor and Huawei aren’t very fast with software updates. Our Honor 9 is running Android 7.0 with EMUI 5.1 and the May 2017 Android security update installed. There is no indication when, or if, the Honor 9 will receive Android 8.0, the next major version of EMUI, or a new Android security patch. The only way to be sure to get Android updates is to buy a Google Pixel 2. for $550) but it starts at almost twice the price of the Honor 9.. Yes, but only if you’re in the U.K. Also, buy the blue version seen here, or the limited edition robin egg blue. model, if you can find one. We don’t recommend importing one to the U.S., due to it only supporting 3G data speeds. The Honor 9 is as good as devices that cost a lot more money, with the added bonus of being really good-looking, and pleasurable to use. If only Honor would release a proper version for the U.S..

The Huawei Honor 9 currently has an Informr score of 8.8 out of 10.. This score is based on our evaluation of 16. sources including reviews from users and the web's most trusted critics.. What's good Sharp and accurate display Good battery life Smooth performance Detailed and vibrant pictures Beautiful, reflective back panel. What's bad Slippery - slides on flat surfaces No optical image stabilization. For years, Huawei wasn’t a player in the mainstream phone market. The Chinese smartphone manufacturer struggled in the mid-tier market, that is until they found a winning formula with the Honor lineup. Their Honor 9 phone hopes to encourage more people to change over by offering a great price.. But does it offer enough bells and whistles to convert people? Let’s find out!. Its even hard today for flagship phones to stand out from the crowd in terms of design. Most sport the same rectangular design with rounded edges.. While Huawei introduces nothing revolutionary in terms of its basic shape, reviewers were impressed, calling the Honor 9 eye-catching. The curved rear panel offers a reflective, shiny finish that diffracts light when held at different angles.. The drawback to this “cool” factor is its handling. Many reviewers found it incredibly slippery. Some said it would slide on flat surfaces due to the glass back.. It comes in a variety of colors, such as bright yellow, white, black and gray.. Its relatively thin profile and lightweight of 155 grams makes it easy for experts to use one-handed and slip into their pockets.. Unlike other devices, the Honor 9 sports a smaller 5.15 inch, 1080p display. The small size translates to higher pixel density. As expected, reviewers were impressed with the screen’s sharpness. They also liked its decent color reproduction and overall brightness.. Huawei didn’t skimp on performance either. The Honor 9 comes equipped with an octa-core processor (4 x 2.4GHz and 4 x 1.8GHz) and 6GB of RAM.. While it might not be as fast as the OnePlus 5 in benchmark tests, critics found it snappy in real life testing even when pushing it by multitasking. Naturally, they also had no issue playing graphics intensive games either.. Equipped with a 3,200mAh battery, the Honor 9 got most critics through a full workday with moderate usage. For heavier usage - watching videos and playing games - they could eke out around 5 hours of screen time.. You’ll find a dual-lens camera on the rear of the phone. The 20MP camera takes pictures in monochrome while the 12MP captures color. In theory, the use of these dual lenses captures more detail.. The overall picture quality and shutter speeds impressed critics. In good lighting, their images came out sharp, vibrant and well-exposed.. Lower light pictures, however, suffered from some noise. Plus, since it doesn’t come with optical image stabilization, they found many of their pictures ended up very blurry.. Despite some minor issues, most reviewers would recommend the Honor 9, especially because of its price tag.. Tech Radar states, “Honor has managed to create an all-around great handset that offers all you’d like in a phone in an attractive, easy-to-use and top-of-the-range package.” Android Authority adds, “The Honor 9 certainly ticks a lot of the right boxes: great performance, dual cameras, sleek design, and an IR blaster!”. - Abbas Jaffar Ali, James Peckham, TechRadar. The Honor 9 offers a lot of what the high-end flagship phones do right now, but for a much lower price. There’s no exciting, headline-grabbing feature here, but a great design, fantastic performance and lots of nice touches make this an all-round impressive and affordable phone.. Gorgeous case, good camera, decent battery life – we hardly find any reason for complaint with the Honor 9. If the SoC would not throttle under load, our recommendation would even become more clear, but even as it is, the Honor 9 offers a great price-performance ratio.. The Honor 9 is an attractive option for international smartphone users who want a phone that's compact, a reasonably strong performer, enjoys solid battery life, and offers a decently nice camera – and all for quite a bit less than your typical flagship. There's no one stand-out area where the.... The Honor 9 offers a lot of what the high-end flagship phones do right now, but for a much lower price. There’s no exciting, headline-grabbing feature here, but a great design, fantastic performance and lots of nice touches make this an all-round impressive and affordable phone.. - What Hi-Fi team, What Hi-Fi. With features you’d expect from a more expensive phone, the Honor 9 has usurped OnePlus as the de facto high-end smartphone for anyone on a budget - even if overall performance is good rather than great.. Huawei released the Honor 9 on June 27, 2017.. Where can I download the Honor 9 manual?. We've got you covered! Download a free PDF copy of the Huawei Honor 9 user manual here .. How long is the warranty period?. Huawei backs up the Honor 9 with a 1 Year parts & labour warranty.. Where can should I go for support, replacement or repairs?. If your Honor 9 has problems and is still within its warranty period, you could contact Huawei support or the retailer you purchased the phone from. You'll find Huawei's contact information here. If your phone is off warranty and needs repair for a physical problem such as a broken screen or bad battery, you should visit an authorized service centre or a local phone repair shop.

With features you’d expect from a more expensive phone, the Honor 9 has usurped OnePlus as the de facto high-end smartphone for anyone on a budget - even if overall performance is good rather than great.. Huawei takes the fight to the midrange. There’s a dearth of smartphones in the sub £400 bracket, and the Honor 9 fills the space nicely. It’s more powerful than the modular Moto Z2 and the Samsung Galaxy A5, and looks like a handset that costs twice the price.. If £370 is what you have to spend, then look no... There’s a dearth of smartphones in the sub £400 bracket, and the Honor 9 fills the space nicely. It’s more powerful than the modular Moto Z2 and the Samsung Galaxy A5, and looks like a handset that costs twice the price.. If £370 is what you have to spend, then look no further. If, on the other hand, you check your wallet again and find an extra £70 you want to add to the phone kitty then look at the OnePlus 5 instead. It’s more expensive, but you get a lot more bang for your buck in nearly every way: performance, screen, camera and battery life. It doesn’t have expandable storage, but that’s a price worth paying.. Affordable flagships never look this good. While the Honor 9 could be dismissed as simply a lesser-specced Huawei P10, in reality, having used both handsets as daily drivers, the Honor 9 simply has more heart, which is an admittedly weird thing to say about an inanimate object. The Honor 9 delivers in just about every area you would want,... While the Honor 9 could be dismissed as simply a lesser-specced Huawei P10, in reality, having used both handsets as daily drivers, the Honor 9 simply has more heart, which is an admittedly weird thing to say about an inanimate object. The Honor 9 delivers in just about every area you would want, and despite the camera’s less-than-perfect performance in low-light conditions, the Honor 9 is another winner for the budget brand.. This is the bargain of the decade. At that price, the Honor really is an absolute steal. It's a great smartphone with high-end specs and a premium design.. There are a lot of neat touches, too, we especially like the single navigation key, and the dual camera is capable of taking some striking images..

Flagship specs and dual cameras for less than you might expect. The Honor 9 certainly ticks a lot of the right boxes: great performance, dual cameras, sleek design, and an IR blaster!

The Honor 9 certainly ticks a lot of the right boxes: great performance, dual cameras, sleek design, and an IR blaster! The only downsides are the lack of toughened glass over the display and the slippery nature of the build materials. The software offers some good extra features and the ability to enable an app drawer should help EMUI find greater acceptance in the West. Overall I would say if you are looking for a high-end device but you can’t quite afford the price of the Huawei P10 or the Mate 9, then you should certainly think seriously about getting an Honor 9.. The Honor 9 isn’t a world apart from the Honor 8, but is does have a more attractive design, a somewhat-improved camera and double the storage. Changes made to Emotion UI also make it less polarising, as it can now be made to feel a lot more like ‘normal’ Android..

Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro announced: AI-powered Android flagships. Kirin 970: Huawei’s new mobile CPU puts AI in the spotlight. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.. Impressed by the OnePlus 5 but put off by the price? The cheap(er) Honor 9 might be just the ticket.. Editor Rating: Excellent (4.0) Jul 27, 2017. second-SIM-or-microSD dilemma, 'cheap', but not cheap.. The Honor 9 is a powerful, stylish and inexpensive phone that squares up to the high end players.. Honor 9: Design, features, display and storage. Honor 9: Android 7.0 + EMUI 5.1. Honor 9: Kirin 960 CPU, 3,200 mAh battery. Honor 9 Camera: 2x hybrid zoom, wide aperture bokeh effects, superior low light shots. Honor 9 Camera: 4k at 30fps, 1080p Full HD at 30 and 60fps. Honor 9 Front camera: 8-megapixels of flashless selfie fun. O2: (5.65Mbps) / (10.15Mbps) / (29.41ms). EE: (16.48Mbps) / (18.65Mbps) / (42.25ms). Vodafone: (5.06Mbps) / (3.01Mbps) / (33.58ms). Three: (4.95Mbps) / (4.84Mbps) / (32.25ms). The Honor 9 is Huawei's latest phone and follows in the wake of the recently released Honor 8 Pro as well as high-profile rival the OnePlus 5.. While the Honor 9 hasn't provoked round-the-block queues like the new OnePlus has, it’s upping the value for money ante; at just £379, it's about £70 cheaper than the OnePlus 5 , which, if you're on a tight budget, could make all the difference.. The dual-lens camera set-up comes with a bigger monochrome sensor, promising better night time shots than the 8 Pro, but the screen is smaller and is only a Full HD panel - maybe Honor's saving a big WQHD screen for the Honor 9 Pro.. Like all of Huawei’s current high-end phones, the Kirin 960 octo-core CPU runs everything behind the scenes. Intelligent RAM allocation and recycling supposedly allows for better memory performance and battery longevity. If previous experience of phones like the P10 , P10 Plus and Mate 9 are anything to go by, then the Honor 9 will be quite the powerhouse.. The Honor 9’s official tagline is ‘the light catcher’ and it’s hard to disagree with that. Like the previous Honor 8 Pro, the front and back panels are coated in a reflective glass, offset by a matt finish on the sides. Unlike other phones, where the camera module is highlighted by a discrete section, one that’s often raised out of the main body of the phone, on the Honor 9, it’s flush with the convex glass back.. Available in three different metallic hues - black, blue and silver - the Honor 9 gleams and glistens.. While very easy on the eye, the glossy coat means that the Honor 9 can also be sticky, smudgey and fingerprinty. The shiny exteriors means that the Honor 9 is occasionally slippery, especially if it’s a hot day and you’re getting your sweat on. It can feel a little unpleasant as well.. At the time of writing, no cases available to buy from the official VMall shop, Amazon, or anywhere else, which would neutralise the slippery and fingerprinty problem, not to mention give your Honor 9 some extra protection.. The Honor 9’s display is a 5.15-inch Full HD (1920x1080), which gives you 427.75 pixels per inch, a level of detail that’s comparable to the iPhone 7 Plus (5.5-inches, 401 ppi), though less rich than the Samsung Galaxy S8 (5.1-inches, 567 ppi). It’s an LCD screen and while there’s no mention of IPS on the official spec sheet, viewing angles are incredibly good, though the glass cover means that on bright days, you’ll have to put up with a bit of glare.. On paper, you get 64GB of onboard storage with the Honor 9, but just 48.02GB of that is available to you from fresh. Luckily, you can pop in a mircoSD card (up to 256GB), but doing so will see you forfeit that second SIM card slot. Small beer for most folks in the UK and Europe, but if you’re in the minority who finds having two SIMs on the go useful, you may need to get used to doing regular back ups and/or photo dumps.. Huawei make some of the fastest fingerprint scanners in the game and the Honor 9 is no exception. It unlocks almost instantly and is pretty accurate, we’ve only counted a handful of failed attempts in the time since we’ve had it. It’s fast enough to scan fingerprints that any second attempts to unlock can be made in no time at all.. Registering scans of all of your digits is also quick and easy; it takes less than a minute to take a scan a new finger or thumb. This means however you pick it up and hold it, you’ve got plenty of ways to quickly and securely unlock it with either hand.. Huawei’s elected to pop the scanner on the front of the Honor 9, in contrast to the previous two models in the range, where they were mounted on the back. If you’re used to unlocking phones this way, then having to re-learn how to acquaint your meat hooks with a scanner on the front might take a bit of getting used to, but this won’t you long.. On top of Android 77.0 Nougat is version 5.1 of Huawei’s EMUI, pronounced ‘Emotion UI’, FYI.. This exhibits the same stripped down and clean approach to menus we’ve seen on high-end Huaweis since the Mate 9. The main gimmick is that the great majority of options are no more than three clicks away once you open up the Settings.. When you’re in any sub menu, tapping the options pancake stack/hamburger button up on the top left will see the main Settings menu accessible in a scrollable column which sits on the left hand side of the screen, instead of taking you back up to the full menu.. While that doesn’t sound like a big deal on paper, it’s a smart design choice which makes it easier for first timers to mind map the Settings layout on the Honor 9.. This, combined with uncluttered, white backgrounds and simplified icons make poking around for whatever you’re looking for effortless. We wish that vanilla Android was this easy.. By default, new app icons are placed on the homescreen once they’re downloaded from Google Play. You’re encouraged to drop everything into themed folders (see below), or, if you’d prefer the typical Android layout - your most commonly used apps on the home screen with everything else hidden in the launcher - you switch between that and the folders-only mode.. Another feature we’re keen to see returning from previous EMUI-running phones is the Storage Cleaner tool, which lets you zero in on and delete unused and dormant apps. There’s even a sub-folder here for blurry images, which means bad pictures you’ve taken can be banished from your phone without you even having to look at them.. As well as being able to feng shui storage space, this, combined with the RAM cleaning feature which runs in the background, means you can easily keep on top of bloat and creeping crapware .. On that note, there’s a handful of pre-installed apps on here, including eBay, Booking.com and TripAdvisor, which you may or may not want to use - they’re easy enough to get rid of if you don’t.. Benchmarking results put the Honor 9 a little behind the likes of powerful (and more expensive) Android phones like the the Samsung Galaxy S8 and OnePlus 5 and more or less on par with the Huawei P10 and P10 Plus - which, seeing as those phones feature the same HiSilicon Kirin 960 CPU, you might expect.. Huawei’s sales pitch with its current run of phones is that the Kirin 960, following ARM’s big.LITTLE philosophy , is backed up with a dedicated sensor module and machine learning-powered usage monitoring.. This basically means that dormant tasks like step counters and location services take up less power, thanks to those processes being run by a dedicated, slower processor core, and intelligent RAM allocation sees memory set aside for your most used apps and games. Older programs you’ve not touched in a while will be ‘cleaned’; memory will be freed up as and when your usage habits change.. This optimal performance also equates to optimal power usage, in theory. In our experience, that definitely is the case; after a typical day’s use, checking emails, making calls, using social media and streaming video on the train ride home, we’d have about 20-30 per cent power left in the tank.. It’s not going to stop your phone from losing power faster in the future - all lithium-ion batteries degrade over time - but these features should help mitigate that by optimising processes where possible.. We’ve noticed that phones like the Mate 9 and P10 Plus have continued to exhibit good battery performance months after we’ve finished reviewing them and so we’d venture that the Honor 9 will too, though how well this stacks up after a year remains to be seen.. Out of the box, we were able to get to about half full (48 per cent) from zero using the supplied Quick Charge adapter (5V 2A or 9V 2A) after 45 minutes and 62 per cent after an hour. It took us 1 hour, 56 mins to fully refill the Honor 9. Using a laptop’s USB 2.0 port, we got just 19 per cent after an hour and 33 per cent after two hours; it took just under eight hours (7 hours, minutes) to full fill it up.. In terms of raw battery drain, streaming this at full brightness over 4G gave us 5 hours and 21 minutes. Over WiFi we got even longer - 9 hours and 40 minutes. Maybe don’t rely on your unlimited data plan when bingeing series 2 of Stranger Things , in that case.. The Honor 9 comes with two cameras - a 20-megapixel monochrome sensor and a 12-megapixel RGB shooter - which basically means you can capture more details; the phone takes pictures with both sensors and then combines the images, in theory allowing for more details than a single, bigger sensor would.. This also lets you make use of a number of fun effects, like a ‘hybrid’ zoom (2x lossless digital zoom) a nd a wide aperture mode which lets you retroactively blur out background details, making foreground objects like flowers look even more detailed.. Low light shots are pretty impressive, often pulling in more detail in dark rooms that you might expect based on what’s in the viewfinder, but as you can see, even with the flash on, dark and dim shots suffer from noise in all the usual places. There’s no optical image stabilisation either, meaning you’ll need a steady hand, especially when taking shots at night.. There’s a wealth of manual controls options, including sensitivity (ISO 50-3200), shutter speeds(1/1400-30 seconds), if you want to take long exposures, plus the typical white balance and metering options, as well as continuous and single shot autofocus and manual focus.. In standard auto mode, the Honor 9’s pretty fast at taking snaps, almost instantaneous, and the continuous autofocus reframes shots pretty quickly too, though in situations with lots of movement in the frame, you’ll need to tap to focus yourself, at the Honor 9 can get easily distracted.. On top of this, there’s fun things like time lapse, light painting (essentially a long exposure, ideal for nocturnal city clips) and a bizarre 3D Creator mode, which lets you create Mii/Amiibo/Corinthian-style models of your mates.. The Honor 9 can shoot video at up to 4k (3840x2160) at 30 frames per second, 1080p Full HD at 60 and 30fps and 720p HD at 30fps.. As with stills, video samples are crisp and detailed, but autofocus and stabilisation woes are apparent here; if you want your videos to come out silky smoother, you’ll need a steady hand, or a tripod, as the Honor 9 can result in some shaky clips if you’re not careful.. There’s a Pro Video mode, which lets you manually tweak exposure values, metering (matrix, centre-weighted and spot) white balance and set focus modes (AF-S, AF-C and manual). There’s a wide aperture mode, but we’ve not really been able to see the benefits of this on clips we shot. You can’t shoot with any of the stills filters, so no monochrome or sepia videos; tough luck, steampunks.. It wouldn’t be a Huawei phone without an eye-enlarging, skin whitening and face smoothing beauty mode.. This applies layers of adjustable digital makeup designed to improve how your regular meatbag face looks. As well as this, there’s a ton of arty filters you can slap on to your mugshots to make you look like you’re living in a comic book or a watercolour painting.. For groufies, there’s timers (2, 5, and 10 seconds) and you can either touch anywhere on the screen to capture, use the volume key, or turn on smile detection, which will take a pic upon everyone showing their pearly whites. There’s even an audio control which’ll pick up on you saying ‘Cheese!’.. For the most part, the 8-megapixel sensor does a good job of picking out details and taking decent selfies. The ambient light sensor is quick to adjust to changes in your surroundings.. You can pick ISO, white balance, contrast levels and pinch to zoom, but there’s no way to manually adjust the focus.. In dark or dim areas, things get noisy. To compensate for the lack of a true flash, the Honor 9 instead floods its screen with white pixels, which leads to messy results; often the camera doesn’t focus on your face properly and as the screen’s flooded with light, you can’t actually see what you look like until after the fact. And often you end up looking like you’ve just woken up after a seriously heavy night out.. You can turn the ‘flash’ off, but then you’ll more often than not end up with a grainy, grimy mess that doesn’t really resemble anything. Pro tip: make sure you’re well lit when taking auto mugshots.. The user equipment category of the Honor 9’s LTE antennas hasn’t yet been confirmed, so on paper, there’s no way of telling how fast web browsing speeds on this phone should be - or how they might be affected by future upgrades.. Speedtest.net tests on all of the major networks in a variety of indoor and outdoor locations in central and south east London yielded the following aggregated results:. While EE performed best overall in terms of download and upload speeds, our tests showed that O2 was generally better outdoors. Latency was also higher on EE in all the areas we tested the Honor 9.. The overall web browsing experience was more or less the same between networks, with the PC Mag UK homepage taking around 2-3 seconds to fully load most of the time.. At £379, the Honor 9 is an absolute steal. It’s powerful, beaten only by high end phones like the Galaxy S8 - which is about £300 more unlocked - in the raw benchmarking stakes. It’s also stylish, boasting a slinky, shiny body with a camera module that’s flush to the phone’s undulating back. Unlike a lot of budget phones, the Honor 9 feels more expensive than it actually is.. Now that OnePlus has ascended in the specs (and accordingly, price) stakes with its latest phone, the Honor 9 is arguably a better contender for 2017’s Best Value For Money crown. While £379 is a good price considering what you get for your money, that still might be too much for some; note that when the OnePlus 2 first launched, it was £250.. Other downsides include the slippery gloss exterior (read: you’ll drop this easily) and the current lack of protective cases and, as is increasingly common with dual SIM phones, a second SIM slot that’s also a microSD slot. Given that you get roughly two thirds of the actual promised ROM with the Honor 9, most people will want to get a memory card, so people who need a dual SIM phone for work purposes might want to look elsewhere..

HiSilicon Kirin 960 Octa-core processor (4×2.4 GHz Cortex-A73 & 4×1.8 GHz Cortex-A53) and Mali-G71 MP8 GPU. Dual 20MP + 12 MP, f/2.2, phase detection autofocus, 2x optical zoom, dual-LED (dual tone) flash. EMUI 5.1 base on Android 7.0 Nougat. Teardown is what we do! Follow us on Facebook and Twitter for the latest repair news.. We don’t find the screws at the bottom, and the Huawei Honor 9 uses double sided glass design, so the screen and the rear panel should be fixed to fuselage with glues. There are only speaker grille, 3.5mm headphone jack, and USB Type-C port at the bottom.. Let’s heat the back cover for about 2 minutes with a hair dryer. Open the back cover a little bit with a suction cup. And then insert a pick under the back cover and slide the pick along the edge until open it completely.. There are only two camera holes and a flash hole on the back cover.. You can see the Huawei Honor 9 is still using the classic three-stage design, the upper is the motherboard, the middle is the battery, the lower is the USB-C board. In order to achieve better heat dissipation, it uses a large piece of graphite thermal stickers to cover the fuselage.. Remove all screws securing the metal plate to the motherboard.. You can see it using a whole piece of metal plate to fix a variety of connectors, the metal plate is also attached with some plastic materials, its workmanship is relatively complex.. To ensure that the internal hardware is not damaged, we need to disconnect the battery connector first.. Disconnect the front camera connector and remove it.. I try to remove the rear camera and then remove the motherboard, but did not succeed, the camera fixed very solid. Lift up and remove the motherboard.. The rear camera is fixed on the fuselage with double-sided adhesive, and you must use a small tool to pry it slowly.. The metal shield is coated with thermal grease. Under the metal shield, it should be the processor, the RAM and the ROM.. Rear camera: Dual 20MP + 12 MP, f/2.2, dual-LED flash. You can see that the front camera is assembled by O-Film.. Now let’s take a look the bottom of Huawei Honor 9. The black part is the loudspeaker and is fixed by 7 screws. The following should be the USB-C board.. After removing the screws, we tried to remove the loudspeaker, but it didn’t work. I dare not use too much brute force, so I had to use the hair dryer to heat it up, and then remove the loudspeaker smoothly。. As you can see, there are three metal contacts on the loudspeaker, which are connected the loudspeaker to the USB board.. Disconnect fours connectors and a coaxial cable.. We know that the headphone port is the most commonly used component, the independent headphone port is easier to replace.. The USB-C port with a rubber ring, it can effectively prevent water and dust into the fuselage.. Honor 9 does not use the common adhesive tape to secure the battery, that it should use double-sided adhesive to fix the battery to the fuselage. If you replace the battery will be more trouble, after all, remove the battery is not so easy. RFMD RF5216A F709YX Quad-Band GSM, Linear EDGE Transmit Module. Broadcom BCM47531A1 GPS, GLONASS, Beidou, QZSS receiver. Micron 4GB RAM + Kirin 960. The Huawei Honor 9 is doing quite well in terms of workmanship, and its metal frame makes the internal structure of the fuselage very strong. To achieve better heat dissipation, it uses a large piece of graphite thermal stickers to cover the fuselage, the metal shield of SOC/RAM chip is coated with thermal grease. And details such as rubber ring wrapped USB Type-C port and 3.5mm headphone port are doing quite well.. Each module can be replaced independently, it using a lot of double-sided adhesive and glues, making replacement parts is not so easy..
