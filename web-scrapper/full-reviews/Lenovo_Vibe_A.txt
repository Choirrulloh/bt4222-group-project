Lenovo Vibe A Plus A1010a20 smartphone battery drain problem caused by OS. Float this Topic for Current User. Float this Topic for Current User. Message 1 of 9. Lenovo Vibe A Plus A1010a20 smartphone battery drain problem caused by OS. On any updated version of Android 5.1 OS, firmware 253, 256-latest update avaible since april 2017, the Lenovo Vibe A Plus A1010a20 baterry drains too fast. In 2 days or even a single day the battery is out, without any heavy data traffic or usage.. Battery drains 1% every minute or two to five minutes when phone used, even faster whend data 3G is on, without some bulk apps, without google play stuff and gmail app, chrome etc from Google, all disabled, without any heavy apps, just basic OS apps, wifi off, screen at 30-40% brightness, autosync off, background data off.. The problem is the OS 5.1 ver., is eating battery very very very fast, even with greenify app or similar. The phone is new, bought in march 2017, no heavy usage, battery is new and calibrated.. Are there any others who experienced this problem on their terminals?. Lenovo, please resolve this bug in the next updates this year. It's a common problem for this model as i red on other russian forums for this product and none of the updates from september, november, december 2016 or april 2017 solved this battery drain issue.. Message 2 of 9. Re: Lenovo Vibe A Plus A1010a20 smartphone battery drain problem caused by OS. Try performing a battery calibration first.. To calibrate the battery, press and hold the Power button until the screen goes dark, about 7-10 seconds. When the screen goes dark, release the Power button and the phone will automatically reboot. Plug the phone in and let it charge overnight, using only the charger that came in the box with the phone.. This process will reset the battery table and allow the phone to calibrate overnight.. Message 3 of 9. Re: Lenovo Vibe A Plus A1010a20 smartphone battery drain problem caused by OS. The solution is useless, power buton pressed 7-10 seconds, 15-30, 40 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes and nothing, no restart, nothing. Just the menu with Power Off, Restart, Airplaine Mode, Sound. Other way to calibrate battery or another combination of buttons for this smartphone model?. The bug from Lollipop 5.0 and 5.1 is still there, mobile radio battery drain bug i mean, activated when you open and closed the mobile data connection after you used it, even in these Lenovo forums there are users who have other phones and after the upgrade to Lollipop the battery is drained a lot, the discharge rate is a nightmare. An update from Lenovo could fix it partially if the problem is too big to be handled via updates, still a big difference if this bug is less active.. Message 4 of 9. Re: Lenovo Vibe A Plus A1010a20 smartphone battery drain problem caused by OS. Have you tried performing a Factory Reset on the device?. Message 5 of 9. Re: Lenovo Vibe A Plus A1010a20 smartphone battery drain problem caused by OS. Yes, i tried a factory reset, a total wipe but the battery drain is still there, as i said before. Other ideas, ways to callibrate battery maybe, to patch Android 5.1 ver. Lollipop is a mess, this is certain, two years and the same problems with battery and bugs.... Message 6 of 9. Re: Lenovo Vibe A Plus A1010a20 smartphone battery drain problem caused by OS. What kind of Reset you performed? Was if from Settings or you did a Hard Reset? Battery life also depends on the usage of the phone.. Message 7 of 9. Re: Lenovo Vibe A Plus A1010a20 smartphone battery drain problem caused by OS. Factory reset was done from Recovery with wipe data/factory reset. After reset and two full recharge the battery is still loosing energy and the main problem is Idle and data bug problem from Lollipop-open data, use, close data, bug activates and constant drain.. Yes, battery drain depends on usage, but in my case the usage is normal, wihout heavy data and games, wihout hours of continuous use, heavy apps, just basic apps, telephony, messages, fm radio, when i need email with push. As i said, just simple use of a smartphone and the battery drains too much on Lollipop. On kitkat the battery is draining, it is normal, but at a lower rate per hour, minute... Maybe in next updates after 18.04.2017 update Lenovo will try to find a patch or something for this Lollipop OS-it is well designed as an OS, but it has bugs unsolved yet that drain battery.. Message 8 of 9. Re: Lenovo Vibe A Plus A1010a20 smartphone battery drain problem caused by OS. I try to update to ver. 258 july 2017 OTA update but in software update i have error "network connection failed please try again" on wi-fi or 3G data, i tried factory reset delete cache, stop and restart update app nothing works. Are there any problems with Lenovo Update servers?, because it seems to me that there are down, as i saw in other threads with the same error.... Please, fix this error as soon as possible.. Message 9 of 9. Re: Lenovo Vibe A Plus A1010a20 smartphone battery drain problem caused by OS. Now updates are working, all seems fine for now, servers are up 10.08.2017 18.00PM, Romania time..

Spesifikasi dan Harga Lenovo Vibe A. 124.5 x 64 x 10.6 mm. 480 x 800 pixels (~233 ppi pixel density). Eksternal : Microsd up to 32 GB. âBaca Juga : Daftar Harga HP LenovoÂ. Kelebihan dan Kekurangan Lenovo Vibe A. Harga Lenovo Vibe A â Lenovo secara diam-diam kembali merilis hp android murah terbarunya. HP Android tersebut diberi nama Lenovo Vibe A. Yang dikabarkan sudah dirilis dipasar Rusia. Dilihat dari desain serta spesifikasinya, seri ini tampaknya merupakan generasi penerus Lenovo A1000. Yang pastinya ketikponsel lovers ingat bahwa Lenovo A1000 di Indonesia dipatok dengan harga dibawah 1 juta rupiah.. Lenovo Vibe A dilaporkan memakai layar touchscreen berukuran 4 inci. Layar kecil tersebut dibekali resolusi 800 x 480 pixels. Tergolong kecil memang, tapi hal ini dibuat oleh Lenovo karena harga Lenovo Vibe A tidak mencapai 1 juta rupiah. Lalu disektor kameranya dibekali kamera beresolusi 5 MP untuk bagian belakang. Dimana kamera tersebut dilengkapi fitur autofocus serta LED Flash. Untuk bagian depannya sendiri memakai lensa beresolusi VGA tanpa autofocus.. Sejatinya Lenovo Vibe A ini diperuntukkan oleh pengguna yang baru memakai smartphone. Dengan harga Lenovo Vibe A yang murah. Lenovo tetap membekali beberapa kelebihan di hp android murah tersebut. Salah satunya adalah prosesor Quad Core berkecepatan 1.3 Ghz yang cukup nyaman untuk kebutuhan sosial media maupun browsing.. HP Lenovo Vibe A ini memakai RAM berkapasitas 512 MB dan memiliki ruang penyimpanan sebesar 4 GB. Selain itu, ia juga sudah berjalan disistem operasi Android Lollipop. Tampilan antarmukanya sendiri memakai Lenovo Vibe UI yang dijamin akan ramah dan mudah untuk dioperasikan. Untuk lebih jelasnya mengenai spesifikasi dan harga Lenovo Vibe A tersebut. Maka ketikponse lovers bisa melihat ulasan lengkapnya dibawah ini.. HP Android Lenovo ini memakai desain berbahan plastik. Sehingga kesan premium mungkin kurang tampak pada smartphone tersebut. Layaknya hp android dibawah 1 juta lainnya. Disisi pengoperasiannya cukup mudah apalagi untuk dimasukkan kedalam sakut serta dioperasikan menggunakan satu tangan mengingat bobotnya hanya 132 gram saja. Sedangkan untuk ketebalannya sendiri mencapai 10.6 mm.. Lenovo Vibe A tersedia di 2 pilihan warna yakni Onyx Black dan Pearl White. Seperti yang sudah kami sampaikan diatas, bahwa spesifikasi Lenovo Vibe A ini memakai layar berukuran 4.0 inci. Yang memiliki rasio layar dengan bodinya mencapai 57,2% cukup bagus untuk sebuah hp android dibawah 1 juta dari Lenovo. Selanjutnya soal resolusi layarnya, Lenovo Vibe A tergolong cukup kecil. Belum mencapai HD namun bukan berarti spesifikasi tersebut adalah sebuah bentuk kekurangan.. Mengingat hp android dibawah 1 juta dari vendor lainnya juga sama dibekali resolusi layar sebesar itu saja. Tentunya di harga Lenovo Vibe A pihak Lenovo tidak memberikan perlindungan ekstra di layar smartphone tersebut. Sehingga disarankan buat ketikponsel lovers yang ingin membeli hp android ini untuk membeli juga tempered glass tambahan.. Layar Lenovo Vibe A ini hanya mendukung 2 sentuhan jari saja. Sehingga kurang rekomendasi untuk bermain game. Yang sejatinya game android saat ini membutuhkan 5 sentuhan jari. Konektivitas Lenovo Vibe A tergolong lengkap dari USB, Bluetooth, Wifi dan slot kartu Dual SIM. Tapi sayang hp android murah ini tidak dibekali dukungan jaringan 4G LTE. Lagi lagi hal ini menyangkut soal harga Lenovo Vibe A yang dipatok murah.. Untuk bagian kameranya, Vibe A menggunakan kamera beresolusi 5 MP yang disertai Autofocus dan LED Flash. Untuk fitur lainnya masih standar sama seperti hp android murah yang saat ini beredar di Indonesia.Â. Hp android ini masih kurang cukup mumpuni untuk aktifitas selfie. Pasalnya, HP Lenovo Vibe A hanya menyertakan kamera beresolusi VGA dibagian depan.. Lalu untuk daya tahan baterainya juga tergolong standar masih dibawah 2000 mAh. Yang mungkin kurang cukup memadai untuk digunakan selama seharian. Lenovo Vibe A juga hanya memiliki 1 sensor saja yakni Accelerometer. Belum ada sensor Proximity maupun Gyro. Hal inilah yang menjadi salah satu kekurangan Lenovo Vibe A dibandingkan ponsel android lainnya.. Soal performa kinerjanya relative terbaik dikelasnya. Walau masih memakai chipset buatan Speadtrum, namun chipset tersebut sudah memiliki otak prosesor berkekuatan Quad Core 1.3 Ghz. Kapasitas penyimpanan dirasa cukup lega berkat dukungan slot microsd berkapasitas 32 GB. Lalu untuk multitaskingnya cukup untuk digunakan membuka beberapa aplikasi sosial media tanpa menutup aplikasi sebelumnya.. Harga Lenovo Vibe A memang murah. Tapi sayang saat ini ponsel android Lenovo murah ini baru dijual dipasar Rusia. Belum ada kabar lagi soal apakah Lenovo Vibe A juga akan dihadirkan oleh Lenovo ke Indonesia atau tidak. Yang jelas seri pendahulunya yakni Lenovo A1000 sudah dijual di Indonesia. Dan banyak peminat dari seri Lenovo A1000 ini dikarenakan harga yang dibanderol murah.. Baca Juga : Harga Lenovo Phab 2 Plus Terbaru. Ponsel android murah Lenovo Vibe A memang cukup bagus untuk pemula. Buat yang hanya membutuhkan ponsel pintar untuk sosial media maupun browsing. Hp Lenovo Vibe A sudah cukup bagus. Apalagi harga Lenovo Vibe A yang ditawarkan sangat murah.. Related Posts Harga Nokia 3310 4G Terbaru dan Spesifikasi Lengkap 2018.

This is one of the smallest diagonal for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. In 2011, Medion AG, a European computer hardware manufacturer, owned the majority of the company. In 2014, Lenovo took over Motorola Mobility, which gave them a boost in the smartphone market.. From 2014 to 2016 Lenovo's market share in the global notebook market was 20-21%, ranking second behind HP. In the smartphone market, Lenovo did not belong to the Top 5 global manufacturers in 2016..

Lenovo Vibe A: 4-inch Display, 512MB RAM, Android 5.1 Lollipop. 4-inchy WVGA 480 x 800 pixel resolution Display. 4GB internal storage, expandable via microSD. Dimensions: 124.5 x 64 x 10.6 mm. Lenovo has announced a new low-end budget smartphone.. Lenovo hasn’t been competing as fiercely as they did before with the Philippines’ local brands. They used to price their products lower, to take away market share from the local manufacturers. The Lenovo Vibe K5 was expected to be priced less than Php5,000, but it disappointingly ended up being Php6,999.. At this point, the Lenovo Vibe A can be considered as super low-end. With its low RAM capacity of only 512MB, low WVGA (480×800) resolution, and paltry 4GB internal storage – everything about it screams low-end.. The phone has been first announced in Russia and its price is still unknown as of the moment. We hope that Lenovo will give a competitive price tag given its internals. For almost the same set of specs, the Starmobile Play Click currently retails for only Php1,288 with a FREE Smart SIM ..
