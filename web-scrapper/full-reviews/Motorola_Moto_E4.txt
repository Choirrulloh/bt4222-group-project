Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus. PCMag reviews products independently , but we may earn affiliate commissions from buying links on this page.. Fingerprint sensor, dual-band Wi-Fi, removable battery, and expandable storage. The Android-powered Motorola Moto E4 offers smooth performance and lots of features for a bargain price.. Affordable phones often demand some form of compromise. The Motorola Moto E4 isn't perfect, but for $129.99 unlocked, you get smooth performance, the latest Android software, and features not often found in this price range, like a fingerprint sensor and dual-band Wi-Fi. We have a few quibbles, such as a mediocre camera and some bloatware, but you'll be hard-pressed to find a better phone for the price. That makes the E4 our Editors' Choice.. The Moto E4 is available unlocked for $129.99 and on Verizon with a prepaid plan for $69.99. Models will also be solid on Boost and Sprint, though pricing details aren't yet available. The unlocked and Verizon models share the same hardware. The Boost and Sprint models will have a more powerful Snapdragon 427 processor. An Amazon Prime exclusive model with a lower price subsidized by ads will also launch at a later date. Unlike Motorola's G5 Plus and Z2 Play , the Moto E4 doesn't have a metal body, and isn't compatible with the company's Moto Mod accessories. What you get instead is a lightweight and fairly compact black plastic phone with a removable back cover. It feels sturdy and grippy, with no creak or flex to the back.. At 5.7 by 2.8 by 0.4 inches (HWD) and 5.3 ounces, the Moto E4 is similar in size to the Blu R1 HD (5.6 by 2.8 by 0.3 inches, 5.0 ounces) and the Alcatel A30 (5.6 by 2.8 by 0.3 inches, 5.2 ounces). Despite a sizable bezel at the top and bottom of the phone, I didn't have trouble reaching across it with a thumb. If you have small hands there's a One-Handed mode that can be activated to shrink the phone's display, as well as a Split Screen mode so you can run one app on the top half of the screen and another on the bottom.. On the right side you have a stiff volume rocker and power button. The top has a 3.5mm audio jack and the bottom has a micro USB charging port. The back cover also peels off from the bottom right to give you access to a removable battery, a SIM card slot, and a microSD slot that worked with a 256GB card.. The phone is covered in a water-repellent coating, so it should be able to handle accidental spills and light rain, but you shouldn't submerge it in water.. The Moto E4 has a pleasantly bright 5-inch, 1,280-by-720 display. That works out to a crisp 294 pixels per inch, matching the A30 and R1 HD. Colors are vivid and viewing angles are good, with the screen being more easily visible from the sides than the A30. At maximum brightness it's a bit of a challenge to see under direct sunlight, but it was still usable outdoors. The phone supports Motorola's Active Display, which show you battery status, date, notifications, and time as soon as you pick up the phone.. Below the display you'll find a fingerprint sensor that's nearly as responsive as the one on the G5 Plus, with similar navigation capabilities. Swiping to the left takes you back, swiping right brings up recent apps, touching the sensor once unlocks the phone, touching it again lets it function as a home button, and holding it down brings up Google Assistant.. The unlocked and Verizon Moto E4 models support CMDA, GSM, and LTE bands 1/2/4/5/7/8/13/17/25/26/38/41/66. The phone showed strong network performance in midtown Manhattan, where we recorded a high of 21Mbps down and 7.7Mbps up. This is in line with results we've seen on other Verizon phones in the area and our findings in the Fastest Mobile Networks 2017 .. Other connectivity options include Bluetooth 4.1, and Wi-Fi on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. Dual-band Wi-Fi is rare to find on a phone below $200, and something you don't get on the A30 or R1 HD. There's no NFC, which isn't surprising.. Transmissions are a bit muddy, but not overly so. Earpiece volume is loud, since like with the G5 Plus, the earpiece doubles as a speaker. Noise cancellation is effective at blotting out most background noise aside from wind .. The E4 is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processor clocked at 1.4GHz, a basic midrange chipset. In the AnTuTu benchmark (a measure of overall system performance), it scores 36,394, far exceeding the Snapdragon 210-powered A30 (16,720). It's also faster than the R1 HD's MediaTek 6735 (31,847).. The phone has 2GB of RAM, giving it decent multitasking capabilities. That said, there are times that it can hang or stutter when running a lot of apps, but it's nothing too dramatic. And for the price, it's far smoother than much of the competition. If it wasn't for its inability to handle high-end games, I'd have thought I was using a much more expensive device.. See How We Test Cell Phones. The phone clocked 5 hours, 30 minutes in our rundown test, in which we set screen brightness to maximum and stream full-screen video over LTE. That's more than an hour longer than the A30 (4 hours, 13 minutes), and just shy of the R1 HD (6 hours). And because the battery is removable, you can swap it out for a new one. Verizon customers get a 10W fast-charging adapter with the phone, letting you fully charge the battery in about two hours. Unlocked buyers get a 5W charger.. The Moto E4's 8-megapixel rear camera takes decent shots outdoors, but fails to impress in other circumstances. On a sunny day the camera captured solid images without much noise or blur, but on a cloudy day pictures weren't nearly as good. Autofocus failed to lock on in a number of shots, resulting in blur. Indoors pictures were similarly blurry and out of focus. The best shots we took were in the controlled lighting of PCMag's photo studio.. The camera can record 1080p video at 30 frames per second. It's clear, but jittery, and drops frames in lower lighting. There's a limited set of manual controls that let you adjust focus, white balance, and, ISO, but it doesn't make a significant improvement to overall quality.. The Moto E4 ships running Android 7.1.1 Nougat , the same up-to-date version you'll find on the Google Pixel. Even better is that the skin remains very close to stock. Aside from a custom Motorola widget for time , date, and location (which can be removed), everything should be familiar to people who've used vanilla Android.. Because the E4 we tested is a Verizon phone, there is some bloatware, in the form of five Verizon apps that can't be uninstalled. It's not a heavy load, but combined with the OS itself it takes up half of your storage—8.17GB out of 16GB. Fortunately you can use a microSD card if you need more space.. For $130 unlocked (and $70 on Verizon), the Motorola Moto E4 is solid phone for a reasonable price. The Blu R1 HD will cost you a bit less, but it's not quite as fast and runs an old version of Android, not to mention it doesn't have dual-band Wi-Fi or a removable battery. The same goes for the Alcatel A30. Motorola's own G5 Plus is a good alternative if you want a big performance boost across the board, but it also costs more than twice the price of the Moto E4. For its combination of price and performance, the Moto E4 can't be beat , and earns our Editors' Choice..

CNET también está disponible en español.. This is the super-cheap phone to get. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The Moto E4 has a near stock version of Android Nougat, a fingerprint reader, a removeable battery, a selfie flash and is splash resistant -- all while being ridiculously cheap.. The Bad The display is hard to see in sunlight and the camera is slow to process photos.. The Bottom Line The Moto E4 is the cheapest Motorola phone but doesn't compromise too much on its amenities.. Motorola budget phones in the US. Motorola makes wonderful budget phones like the Moto G5 and the G5 Plus. Its newest addition is the Moto E4 which packs a lot of features: Android Nougat 7.1, a fingerprint sensor, a removeable battery and a selfie flash all within a body the size of a chubby iPhone 7. The E4 is ridiculously cheap: $130, £129 or AU$249 for an unlocked model. Here in the US, an Amazon Prime version with lock screen ads is $99 and one on a Verizon prepaid plan is just $70.. There are times where the low cost shows. The processor is slow, the display is hard to view in sunlight and the camera is sluggish to process shots. If this is a deal breaker, you can pay a bit more for one of Motorola's other budget phones that have higher specs.. In the US and UK, Motorola also makes the E4 Plus, which has a larger screen, a bigger battery and a higher megapixel camera for $180 and £159, respectively. On paper, the UK version seems worth the £30 upgrade since it comes with 3GB of RAM instead of the 2GB found in the US version.. Take a look at the Moto E4: A super-cheap wonder. In Australia, there's the Moto G5, which has a better metal build, a higher resolution display and a higher megapixel camera for AU$50 more.. The reason you buy the E4 is its price. And for the price, it's amazing what Motorola gives you. Its nearest rival is the Samsung Galaxy J3 which costs more, takes worse photos and lacks the overall charm of the E4. But if the E4's compromises, such as an average camera, make you sad, remind yourself how much it costs. Still sad? Get the Moto G5 Plus ( $209.99 at Walmart ) .. 1.4GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon (425 or 427). The E4's slick glass display looks handsome, but in my hand the plastic back feels low-end. The phone's charm comes from details like a textured sleep/wake button, a selfie flash and a fingerprint sensor.. My favorite E4 feature, one button navigation, turns the fingerprint sensor into a mini navigation touchpad. It's also on the Moto G5 and G5 Plus.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition....

A 5-inch, 720-pixel display (not very detailed or bright by today's standards) A Micro-USB charging port 16GB of storage, though you can add up to 128GB more with a microSD card 2GB of RAM No NFC (neither does the E4 Plus). Moto E4 Plus, Moto G5 Plus, Nokia 5 and Huawei Honor 6x. Meet Motorola's latest affordable, feature-packed phone: the Moto E4. It looks just like a Moto G5 Plus , but it's smaller and cheaper, costing only $130 or £129, which converts to about AU$215. The E4 has a slightly more expensive sibling, the larger E4 Plus , which packs a behemoth 5,000mAh battery.. I'm still early in my Moto E4 testing, but here are my first impressions so far.. The E4 runs a version of Android Nougat 7.1 with only a thin layer of Motorola software on top -- the usual Moto flair, like being able to view notifications while the screen is off, and some handy shortcut gestures as well.. Below the display on my review unit is a wide fingerprint sensor, which works as well as the Touch ID on the iPhone 7. Like the Moto G5 Plus and the Moto Z2 Play the E4 has One Button Nav that turns the sensor into a navigation pad:. The Moto E4 has a removable battery.. Not every region will get a fingerprint reader. For those that don't, the Moto E4 won't be able to secure the phone with a fingerprint, or navigate you around your apps.. The Moto E4's body has a familiar, simple design with rounded corners and is splash resistant. The back is unapologetically plastic, and pops off so you can swap out the battery. In our looped video playback test, the E4 lasted 11 hours -- low for a budget phone, which typically last 13-14 hours.. The Moto E4 has a selfie flash.. It has 8-megapixel rear camera that shoots decent photos, but the dynamic range isn't great. On a bright sunny day, highlights blow out and shadows get crunched into black. Once this happens it's hard to get those nuances back. In other situations without such extremes, the camera produces good shots.. On the front is a 5-megapixel camera with a dedicated flash. In dark situations the flash gave selfies a harsh artificial look, but in backlight the flash added a nice touch of light to make pictures look more even.. Then there are the aspects of the E4 that make it feel like a budget phone:. On paper its 1.4GHz quad-core Snapdragon 425 processor (or 427 depending on region) seems underwhelming. But in my limited time with the E4, I didn't find it sluggish when I switched apps or streamed video.. The Moto E4 is as small as Chewbacca.. My testing continues, so check back soon for a full rated review of the Moto E4 with even more details about how well it works, including a deeper dive into processor speeds and that camera.. The Motorola Moto E4 is available in the US from Verizon now. You can buy it unlocked at Motorola's website and from other third-party retailers (like Amazon) starting June 30. You'll be able to buy it globally later this summer.. 5.7 x 2.8 x 0.37 in. 6.1 x 3.1 x 0.39 in. 5.9 x 2.9 x 0.3 in. 5.9 x 2.9 x 0.34 in. 5.9 x 3 x 0.3 in. 145 x 72 x 9.3 mm. 155 x 78 x 10 mm. 150 x 74 x 7.7 mm. 150 x 73 x 8.55 mm. 151 x 76 x 8.2 mm.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. by Corey Gaskin. Verizon - Verizon + Sprint - Sprint + Motorola - Motorola + Android - Android +. 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. Introduction The Moto E series hit the scene in mid-2014, quick on the heels of the Moto G’s success in the mid-range market. While the G series has offered solid, though intermediate, hardware at less than half the cost of high-end flagships, the E series was priced and configured specifically for entry-level consumers. Delivering a similarly high value proposition in the $100 - $200 price range – even in the days when 2-year contracts were all the rage – MSRP on the E series was kept low, typically hovering around the $100 mark. This year, we see the return of this low-cost performer – now in its 4th generation – dubbed the Moto E4. Selling for $129.99, an unlocked version is available on Motorola’s website. And although the Verizon prepaid variant is inexplicably listed at $199 on their website, it’s been permanently on sale since its launch, priced at an ultra-competitive $69.99. The question is: has the company done enough with the E series to move the brand along while also executing on its own standard of entry-level value? In the box: Moto E4 Wall charger Micro-USB Cable Quick-start guide Design Polished edges and a textured plastic back help give the E4 a more solid look and feel; the fingerprint scanner adds a touch of technological class The Moto E4 won’t be winning any awards for amazing thinness or groundbreaking design curves, but the thicker, still rounded sides give the E4 a solid feel in the hand. The micro-textured plastic back meets the polished plastic edges of the phone snugly to create a tight, cohesive seal. Sure, a fingernail can easily pry between the two – which it’s meant to allow – but there’s very little concern of the back flying off during a bad drop. Below the screen , we find the devices fingerprint sensor – which itself is not a physical button, but rather built into the face of the device – something we’re happy to see in this price range. Aside from adding security, this also serves to promote a more premium fit and finish for the device, raising the bar slightly for entry-level competitors. Above the screen is a 5-megapixel selfie camera, accompanied by a single-LED flash for those who shan’t let low light spoil their selfies. Around back you’ll find Motorola’s familiar camera bump, a modestly raised glass circle encompassing the 8-megapixel lens and single-LED flash. Motorola says the device is “water-repellent” thanks to nanocoating which “creates a water-repellent barrier to help protect against moderate exposure to water such as accidental spills, splashes, or light rain.” While not fully waterproof, some level of resistance is more than you’ll see in most phones from this price range. Display Colors appear vivid, but limited range and low pixel-density can blend details and flatten images As can be expected of such a budget-friendly device, the display isn’t breath-taking but certainly gets the job done. For most, the color range and clarity of this 720 x 1280 px screen will be sufficient, as it does reproduce colors well, albeit within a more limited range than a flagship device might have. The narrower color gamut and below average pixel density (294ppi) serve to soften edges and provide less detail overall. On the other hand, brightness is good, and coupled with the vivid color scheme, provides more than enough detail for the average user.. 5.69 x 2.83 x 0.37 inches. 144.5 x 72 x 9.3 mm. 6.1 x 3.05 x 0.38 inches. 155 x 77.5 x 9.55 mm. 5.33 x 2.61 x 0.31 inches. 135.4 x 66.2 x 7.9 mm. 5.68 x 2.87 x 0.37 inches.

I never thought that a crappie phone like that will get a better score than phones like htc u11 or one plus 5. I think maybe the reviewers lost their minds.... (Posts: 353; Member since: 28 Sep 2015). posted on 04 Jul 2017, 11:28. the ironic here is that a $100 does more 3 times more multitasking than the $700 iPhone 7 plus. who care if the iPhone launch 1 second faster games when this $100 device does more task. (Posts: 739; Member since: 17 Jan 2014). posted on 04 Jul 2017, 15:36. I have a Moto E 2nd gen, and it also has a poor camera, but I really don't care that much, as I have never truly needed a high-end camera for anything (my Nokia E75 took better pictures than my Moto E, but I almost never used the camera, either). I really really REALLY hope this new Moto E4 comes to Cricket, especially if it is cheaper than the unlocked version. I would happily pay the Verizon price of $69.99, but I know that might be a little unrealistic to ask for in this case. And as for the score, just remember that this is taking into account that it is competing against other hundred-dollar phones in the entry-level. If a Moto E scores the same score as a Samsung flagship, I don't expect the hundred dollar phone to be the equivalent of the flagship phone. They aren't competing with each other at all.

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better!

Download our Official Android App: Forums for Android!. Discussion in ' Android Devices ' started by bershan2 , Aug 24, 2017 .. I know that Motorola Moto E4 comes in multiple variants, including XT1763 (sold in Brazil with Dual-SIM and MediaTek MT6737, but no compass), XT1766 (sold in EU with NFC, Single-SIM and MediaTek MT6737), and XT1767 (sold in USA with Single-SIM and Snapdragon). Therefore I wonder: does rooting (especially unlocking bootloader) work differently on the different variations of the phone?. I have XT1767 version bought prepaid from Verizon, so I am especially interested in it. Internet is full of guides, but not all of them specify which model they&nbsp; apply to. I heard that Verizon is notorious for making it hard to unlock their phones, but is there really nothing I can do?. I have seen a post by @andMego , but unfortunately he does not specify which version he has, neither provides much detail about the process he followed (instead fixes issues with his own device).

To root the international versions you basically do fastboot oem unlock and then flash TWRP and root. My original E4 had bad ghost touch issues so I had to get a new one and I haven't unlocked the bootloader yet.. What if i get the Verizon version unlocked? Like Verizon was to unlock it for me. Could we then get it rooted?. There is no way to root the Verizon version.

I'm assuming you mean your bootloader can't be unlocked in which case you can't possibly root under any circumstances, give up. If that's not what you mean can you give more details?

http:/ / www.phonescoop.com/ articles/ article.php? a=19276. Review: Motorola Moto E4 for Verizon Wireless. Motorola's entry-level Android handset, the Moto E4, may be small in stature, but it's big on performance. The E4 is an affordable phone that includes a fingerprint reader, a 5-inch screen, and a capable camera. If you're in the market for an everyday device that outguns the competition, the Moto E4 may be your phone. Here is Phone Scoop's in-depth review.. The Moto E4 from Motorola is an entry-level Android smartphone that offers a few high-end perks, such as a fingerprint reader and HD display. If you need a compact handset on the cheap, the Moto E4 includes a balanced feature set and fine performance at an affordable price.. Motorola's entire line of smartphones has adopted some obvious, over-arching design characteristics. First, there's the over-sized, round camera module. You'll easily spot it on the back of the E4. It is similar to those on the recently announced G5 and Z2 Play. Then there's the indented Motorola "M" logo on the back. Let's not forget the gently rounded top and bottom corners with curved ends.. I think Motorola is playing with a double-edged sword here. Surely a consistent design language has some benefits; you can tell this is a Motorola phone. On the flip side, it strips away individuality and personality. The Moto E4 is lacking in both.. I don't expect entry-level handsets to set the bar for high design, but the E4 is a boring slab that tells you exactly where it stands: near the bottom. Available in black or gold, the E4 is nondescript in most every respect. The front is covered in reflective glass and a single plastic shell wraps around the rest of the phone. The plastic has a matte finish that contrasts with the sparkly glass. I do like the way the side edges flow into the rear panel, which itself is slightly curved from side to side. The curves are friendly to your hand, but the phone's lines are plain. Only the crazy camera module gives the E4 any sort of visual appeal.. The phone is smaller than some other phones I've reviewed lately thanks to its 5-inch screen. It still qualifies as "average" as far as I am concerned, and it's certainly not a gigantic grip killer like the ZTE Blade X Max. Most people will be able to hold and use the Moto E4 comfortably for hours at a time. I'd call it a little chubby at 9.3mm thick, but it's really not bad at all. The phone fits into pants pockets with no problem.. Motorola may have selected a fine piece of glass to form the phone's face, but the plastic rear shell is old-school in its feel and quality. The shell has a micro-texture that makes it slightly grippy. This texture vanishes along the side edges, which are smoother. Motorola did a good job assembling the phone. The various pieces all appear to fit together well and I didn't see any gaps in the joints.. The Moto E4 has a plain face that looks like dozens of other black-fronted slabs. The glass fills the majority of the front. It is glued into a thin plastic frame. The joint between the glass and plastic frame is tight, but it has a slight lip thanks to the way the plastic is positioned along the edge of the glass. You can sometimes feel this lip and I wish you couldn't. The user-facing LED flash, in the top right corner, is the most obvious element of the E4's face because it contrasts with the black so much (it's less obvious on the gold model). The Moto logo is barely visible at all, painted in between the earpiece and display. The bezels around the display are very thick, a dead giveaway that this is an inexpensive handset.. You'll note the indented fingerprint reader below the display. The button is easy to find and use. By default, it's set only as a fingerprint reader, but you can turn on some navigation features so it behaves more like a home button (see the Moto App). With the features enables, it can serve as a trackpad and allows you to navigate back or access the app switcher when you swipe left or right, respectively. You won't find any other controls below the display because the E4 uses on-screen buttons to interact with the Android user interface. However, if you turn on the fingerprint reader navigation controls on, the on-screen controls go away.. Motorola settled on a fairly typical arrangement of buttons and controls for the Moto E4. The rough-textured screen lock button is on the right edge, about at the phone's waist line. It is small, the profile is barely adequate, and feedback is mushy at best. The smooth-textured volume toggle is above the screen lock button. It has a better profile, but equally poor feedback. The 3.5mm headset jack is on top, the microUSB port is on the bottom.. The circular camera module stands out. It's about the size of a half dollar and pops up from the surface by about 1mm. A distinct rim encircles the large piece of glass that covers the lens and flash.. You can easily remove the entire rear panel of the E4. Some will be pleased to learn that the battery is removeable. You'll have to yank it out in order to swap SIM or memory cards.. The E4 is well short of waterproof. Like many other Motorola phones, the E4's interior is coated with a water repellant that will make liquid roll off without damaging the circuitry. It can handle some rain and mist, but I wouldn't hold it under a running faucet and you definitely can't dunk it in the pool.. The Moto E4 is a bit of a throw-back. There's nothing new or groundbreaking about it; in fact it feels like smartphones of five years ago. Even so, the E4 is a well-made phone that offers just the right amount of functionality for its form.. The 5-inch LCD panel has 720p HD resolution. Only the least expensive phones have such a small pixel count these days, and there's no question Motorola selected this screen to keep the E4's cost down. With a density of 294 pixels per inch, you can spot individual pixels when you hold the phone close to your eyes, such as when swiping through Facebook in bed. That said, most graphics, images, and text on the screen look sharp and free of pixelated edges.. The LCD panel puts out plenty of light and I had no trouble viewing the screen indoors. Outdoor viewability was hampered by the high reflectivity of the glass. I had to crank the brightness all the way and even then visibility was scattershot. You'll find yourself seeking shade quite often. Colors were accurate and viewing angles very good. The quality of the display matches the price point well.. Motorola sells an unlocked version of the E4 online, but we tested the Verizon-branded model. The phone showed a strong connection to Big Red's network throughout the metro NYC area. I took it on a 90-mile jaunt on the highway, and the phone was able to keep Google Maps running in real-time navigation mode the entire way without fail. I didn't see the phone drop to 3G, and it never lost the network completely. Data speeds were mixed based on signal strength, but that's par for the course. The phone was able to connect phone calls under the worst signal conditions and it did not drop any calls. It performed really well from a wireless perspective.. The unlocked model has wide support for U.S. LTE networks, so it should work reasonably well on carriers other than Verizon.. I was pleased with both the volume and clarity of calls I made with the Moto E4. The phone was easy to hear in crowded spaces and voices cut through cleanly thanks to the punchy speaker. Truly, the E4 does a fine job connecting people and allowing them to speak to and hear one another. Those I conversed with through the Moto E4 said I sounded really good.. The phone supports Advanced Calling on Verizon's network, which translates to HD Voice through VoLTE. As long as you and your caller are both using VoLTE capable handsets on Verizon's 4G network, the sound is incredibly clear.. The earpiece speaker doubles as the speakerphone, something we've seen on Motorola handsets before. The earpiece produces plenty of volume when in speakerphone mode, and in fact you need to be careful not to blast your years. I was able to hear it plainly in a bustling coffee shop, in the car, and on city streets. Clarity is a bit mixed, as the speaker is prone to distortion when pushed too hard.. Ringers and alerts are loud enough to get your attention, and the vibration motor produces plenty of buzzy noise.. Motorola included a 2,800mAh battery with the Moto E4. I don't think you'll need to worry about battery life, as the Moto E4 easily made its way from breakfast to bedtime with no problems at all. We can likely thank the smaller, lower-rez screen for aiding battery life. After several days of testing, the E4 consistently had at least 25% capacity left at the end of the day.. The Moto E4 supports rapid charging via the included cable/charger. Charging the phone for 30 minutes should give you half a day's battery life.. The Moto E4's secondary radios all functioned as I expected them to. I made several calls via my car's hands-free system and they sounded pretty good. Music had a reasonably full sound when passed through a good pair of Bluetooth headphones. The phone had no issue connecting to other phones, accessories, and PCs for swapping files and such.. Google Maps and the E4's GPS radio worked in perfect sync. The phone consistently located me within a few seconds and was accurate to about 20 feet. Real-time navigation between points worked very well.. Hands On with the Livermorium Keyboard Slider Moto Mod. Motorola's partner Livermorium announced plans to bring its $99 slide-out QWERTY keyboard to market. Is this the accessory or your typing dreams?. MetroPCS to Sell Motorola Moto E4 from July 31. T-Mobile today said its prepaid unit MetroPCS will offer the Motorola Moto E4 smartphone beginning July 31. The handset features a metal design, 5-inch 720p HD screen, and 2,800mAh battery.. Motorola Debuts Budget-Friendly Moto E4 and E4 Plus. Motorola today announced the Moto E4 and Moto E4 Plus, two low-cost Android smartphones that sit one step up from the entry-level Moto C handsets.

The Moto E4 delivers a remarkable smartphone experience for just $130. For $130 unlocked, you won’t find a better deal on a smartphone with the latest version of Android.. For $130 unlocked, you won’t find a better deal on a smartphone with the latest version of Android.. For $130 unlocked, you won’t find a better deal on a smartphone with the latest version of Android.. Near stock version of Android 7.1.1. Geekbench 4: 643 single-core, 1,742 multi-core. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. Motorola’s G series has been the benchmark. for exceptional budget smartphones, and the lesser-known Moto E series strives to do the same. to do the same at an even lower cost. With the latest entry — the Moto E4 — Motorola hits the ball out of the park with an impressive phone that offers plenty of value for $130. There will always be some compromises on budget devices, and the Moto E4 is no different. But price is very much the spotlight of this phone, and it’s quite competitive given the solid features you get. In our Moto E4 review, we’ll take a deeper look at what Motorola cut, what it kept, and how it all works in the end.. Budget phones like ZTE’s Max XL. often go for a large screen size, but Motorola keeps things compact with the 5-inch Moto E4. It’s a little thick, but it still feels small due to its light weight, and screen size.. The rear has a plastic, removable back that mimics the design of the Moto G5. It’s fairly minimal, with just a large circular camera in the top, and the Motorola logo at the center. The right side houses the power button and volume rocker – neither feel as “clicky” as we’d like. On the top edge, you’ll find the headphone jack, and the MicroUSB charging port is on the bottom. The E4’s earpiece is also its only speaker.. design here — instead, you’ll find fairly chunky edges surrounding the Moto E4’s screen. There’s a fingerprint sensor on the bottom, and a front-facing camera on the top.. It won’t win any design awards, but the Moto E4 is sleek, compact, and easy to use one-handed.. It has a resolution of 1,280 × 720 pixels, but at 5-inches, it still looks sharp. We didn’t run into any issues while watching YouTube videos at 720p, and while Full HD would always be preferable, we don’t think it’s necessary on a small screen. A lower resolution also helps conserve battery, and keeps the price low. If you really want a 1080p screen, take a look at the Moto G5 Plus .. We did have one qualm, though. The screen does have a pinkish hue that’s easily noticeable when reading text with a white background, or when placing the phone next to other smartphones. It’s far from a deal breaker, but it’s something you need to be aware about before purchasing the smartphone.. For a $130, we weren’t expecting much in the performance department. Thankfully, the Moto E4 surprised us with a mostly responsive and smooth interface. We did notice the occasional stutter and lag when moving through the home screen, and when opening some apps — but it was too infrequent to bother us.. The phone is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 425 (the Sprint version will have a Snapdragon 427) paired with 2GB RAM. You only get 16GB of storage, but you can upgrade it up to 128GB thanks to a MicroSD card slot. Take a look at some of the benchmark scores from the Moto E4:. As a reference, the Moto G5 Plus scored 63,190 on AnTuTu, and it costs more than double the price of the E4. You won’t be able to play intensive games or juggle multiple tasks smoothly on this phone. Games like Crossy Road, Transformers: Forged to Fight, and Drifty Chase take some time to load, but they perform well — expect some stutters. We used Android’s native split-screen view, and again, there were some stutters when scrolling, but we were still able to get the job done.. There is very little bloatware, and there’s no ugly Android skin bogging down the phone.. The Moto E4 runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat, the latest version of Google’s mobile operating system. It’s one of the best parts about the phone — the user interface is incredibly similar to stock Android. There is very little bloatware, and no ugly Android skin bogging down the phone. You can access the Google Now pane by swiping right from the home screen, or chat with the Google Assistant by pressing and holding the Home button.. There are no fancy Motorola features such as twisting the phone twice to trigger the camera, but it does have some of our simple favorites. The classic Moto Display can turn on night mode from sunset to sunrise, and discretely show notifications on your lockscreen. Moto Actions let you get rid of the on-screen Android navigation icons in favor of gestures on the home button.. As a note, the phone’s vibration motor is fairly weak; and there’s no NFC, so you will not be able to use Android Pay.. Cameras have always been a weak point in budget smartphones, and sadly the Moto E4 doesn’t break that streak. The rear camera packs 8 megapixels, while the front has 5. Photos look either underexposed or overexposed — there’s no real dynamic range. Colors are muted, and in low-light situations, photos are incredibly grainy. There’s no form of optical image stabilization, so in poor lighting conditions you have to be especially still so as to avoid a blurry shot.. That being said, Moto E4 photos are good enough to share on social media and with family, and pretty decent for a $130 phone. If you need a phone with fantastic picture quality, you’ll just have to spend a little bit more.. If you leave it in a drawer for a day, you can only expect to lose 10 percent charge.. Thankfully, the Moto E4 will last you a little more than a day. We started a day of testing off with 89 percent, then used the phone to browse the web, watch some videos, and play some games. By 7 p.m., it still had about 40 percent remaining — that’s pretty good. If you leave it in a drawer for a day, you can only expect to lose 10 percent charge.. It charges via a MicroUSB port, and the Verizon model will come with a 10-watt charger, allowing for better rapid charging capability.. Motorola offers a standard warranty that protects your phone from manufacturing defects 12 months from the date of purchase. Accidental drops and water damage are not covered. If you want more protection, you can always sign up for Motorola Care Accidental Protection, which covers water damage and broken screens. It’s costs for $70 for 15 months, or $100 for 24 months.. The Moto E4 costs $130 unlocked in the U.S., and it’s available from Verizon now. On June 30, you’ll be able to buy it from Best Buy, B&H, Fry’s, Motorola.com, and NewEgg.. The Moto E4 will eventually be a part of Amazon’s Prime Exclusive Phones, meaning you will be able to buy it at an even cheaper price with lock-screen offers and ads. It’s unclear when it will be available, and what the price will be. The phone will also make its way to Boost Mobile, Sprint, Flash Wireless, Jet.com, Republic Wireless, Target, and Ting in July. The company said it will share more details later this summer about availability at other carriers.. Motorola Moto E4 Compared To. HTC One M8 Harman Kardon Edition. For $130 unlocked, you won’t find a better deal on a smartphone with the latest version of Android.. The Moto E4 Plus will also be available in the U.S. for $180 later this summer, and you get a whopping 5,000mAh battery, 32GB of internal storage, a 13-megapixel rear camera, and a 5.5-inch screen. Those seem like worthwhile upgrades for $50 more, but it’s ultimately a decision based on how much you can spend.. There’s also the ZTE ZMax Pro , which was our favorite $100 phone from 2016. It’s $100 from MetroPCS, but $180 from T-Mobile. Also, there’s always the Moto G5 Plus. — it’s our top pick as the best budget phone. you can buy for under $300.. Motorola said the Moto E4 has a water repellent coating — this should protect it from splashes and the rain, but it will not survive a dunk in the pool. Thankfully, the build quality is decent enough that the phone should survive a fair share of drops.. It has the May 1 Android security update, but Motorola doesn’t have the best track record anymore of pushing timely version or security updates — especially for its budget offerings. Expect a jump to Android O , but perhaps half a year after Google releases it. We expect this phone to last you two years, but perhaps not much more.. If you’re reading this Moto E4 review, you’re likely looking to purchase a smartphone for very little money. Whether it’s to have a cheap burner smartphone lying around the house, a phone you want to give to your children, or even if you’re looking for a new smartphone — the Moto E4 is a steal at $130, and it’s the right one to buy..

The Moto E4 does everything it needs to and a few things it has no business offering at this price. Its battery will outlast your day. You get the newest version of Android: 7.1. Even the screen is on point: a nice, crisp 720p 5-inch display. The battery is removable and the storage is expandable via inexpensive MicroSD cards.. The brand new Moto E4 includes some exclusive features never before seen in a phone at this price: a fingerprint scanner and a selfie flash.. 2 GB of RAM means you won't be kept waiting with basic smartphone tasks. Simple games are well within reach. If you're looking to play the latest online 3D first-person shooter though, you'll want to step up the value chain. Otherwise, the Moto E4 has things well in hand.. Where the E4 shows its budget price is in the build. It's sturdy but clad in plastics as opposed to metal.. If you've written off phones at the sub-$150 price point, you haven't tried a Moto E. The E4 is a great place to start. It's perfect for price-conscious shoppers and kids alike. Features Fingerprint sensor Expandable storage Water resistant coating. Unlock your phone in a flash.. Add up to 128 GB of extra storage with a MicroSD card.. No need to worry about spills or drips.. © Ting 2018 Site Map Terms of Service Privacy Policy Shipping and Returns Help.
