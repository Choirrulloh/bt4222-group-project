BLU C5 The easiest way to keep your BLU C5 safe against chafes, dirt, dust, grime and everyday wear damage is by using an IQ Shield protector. Each protector is precisely designed for your BLU C5 to make certain that all of the required openings are incorporated to keep your device fully operational. The high quality protective film also features a protective UV layer that prevents the protector from turning yellow, allowing it to remain crystal clear. Each protector is invisible to the naked eye and the smooth surface makes it give the impression as if no protector is installed. Each protector can be easily installed and removed just as easily without ever leaving any residue or marks that will damage your device. Included with every IQ Shield protector pack for the BLU C5 is an installation squeegee, a microfiber cleansing cloth, a protector for your device, and a set of detailed instructions to assist you through your installation. All IQ Shield protectors are backed by a lifetime warranty that will replace your protector free of charge should it ever wear or need to be replaced.. BLU C5 LiQuid Shield Screen Protector.

But in the bargain, you get a low-resolution display and mediocre performance. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus. PCMag reviews products independently , but we may earn affiliate commissions from buying links on this page.. View All 5 Photos in Gallery. The Blu Studio 5.5 is a large, unlocked Android smartphone that rings up for less than $200. But in the bargain, you get a low-resolution display and mediocre performance. The Blu Studio 5.5 ($177.99 list) is a cheap unlocked phablet. But don't let the big screen fool you; Blu cut so many corners to get to this price point that this is a hard phone to love. Our Editors' Choice for unlocked smartphones remains the $349 Google. Nexus 5 , but there are other good, cheaper options both already out on the market and coming soon.. Design The Studio 5.5 is a big deal, and not in a good way. At 6.52 ounces, it's .06 ounce heavier than the 5.5-inch Samsung Galaxy Note 2 , and much heavier than the 4.6-ounce Nexus 5. It measures 6.19 by 3.12 by 0.37 (HWD) inches, which will make it too wide for some people to use one-handed.. The phablet doesn't creak or flex and it's solidly built. It's rounded near the edges and has a flat back, with a raised camera and an LED flash cutout on the upper portion. On the right side of the Studio are the plastic volume rocker and Power button, and the headphone jack is on top. The micro USB port is on the bottom.. Pop off the back to see the microSD memory card slot, large 2,250mAh battery, and two mini-SIM cards (inaccessible without removing the battery), ideal for prepaid SIM cards, but not for swapping out micro SIMs from recent smartphones.. The 5.5-inch TFT LCD has a mediocre 854-by-480 resolution that amounts to about 178 pixels per inch. It looked grainy and visibly low-resolution compared with other current phones. Viewing angles were deplorable; the screen was either too light or dark if not viewed straight on. Since you don't get more working real estate than on smaller phones, the big screen is really only useful here for people who need larger type and touch targets.. View All 5 Photos in Gallery. Underneath the phone's display are three dedicated capacitive buttons. The Studio, like the related Blu Life Play , uses the old Menu button instead of the now-common Recent Apps button.. Connectivity The Studio 5.5 lacks both LTE and the next step down, HSPA+ 42. It does support HSPA+ 21 on the 850/1900 bands, giving it pretty good AT&T coverage and limited T-Mobile coverage. The phablet makes room for two mini-SIM slots, making it easy to have a personal and business number on the same device. The Dual SIM Settings page lets you relegate each SIM card to certain actions like making calls or handling data connections. AT&T, T-Mobile, and virtual carriers that use those networks are able to use dual-SIM phones like the Studio 5.5, but carriers like Verizon and Sprint are not. The Studio also has 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity.. If you're mainly looking for a phone to make calls, I would suggest something a little smaller than the Studio. As far as call quality is concerned, you want to use a Bluetooth headset here. With the earpiece, there were no major issues, but a slight hissing could be heard by the person on the other end, and noise cancellation wasn't particularly impressive. Noise cancellation is nonexistent when using the quiet speakerphone. When using a Jabra Style Bluetooth headset, I sounded much clearer, and noise cancellation improved. In our talk time tests, the Blu Studio 5.5 lasted 9 hours and 25 minutes, not particularly long for a phone this size.. Performance and Multimedia Inside the Studio 5.5 are the same MediaTek 1.2GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 processor and 1GB RAM we saw in the the Life Play. The phablet is running Android 4.2.1 Jelly Bean, which functions very smoothly. Thanks to MediaTek, there is very little bloatware—just an FM radio app, a flashlight, a file explorer, and an app manager. MediaTek also added a bunch of quirky translation errors that native English speakers may find a bit odd. Casual browsing through Web pages in Chrome or in the Play Store didn't elicit any hang-ups in performance.. The GFXBench graphics benchmark only produced 14 frames per second, making the Studio 5.5 unusable for high-end gaming. It couldn't run Asphalt 8 at all, and Asphalt 7 was practically unplayable due to sluggish and choppy performance. Fruit Ninja ran with occasional fits and starts, and Candy Crush Saga ran without issue.. Media playback wasn't particularly great in any respect. The phone handled most files just fine, but only up to 720p resolution. WMA and WMV formats also aren't supported. The rear speaker was underpowered, and applause devolved into what sounded more akin to white noise than clapping. The phone has 1.75GB of free storage, so a microSD card is strongly recommended. The Studio 5.5 reads up to 64GB cards.. The rear 5-megapixel camera takes photos almost instantly, which makes capturing things quickly a breeze. Unfortunately, the image quality makes it less suited for being your preferred camera. There's a lot of noise in low light shots, and outdoor shots are often overexposed, destroying detail. The front-facing VGA-resolution camera isn't good either, and looks too washed out for any Instagram-worthy selfies. Video recording at 720p is a poor experience. Whether indoors or out, significant image noise was visible. Inside, frame rates dropped to as low as 13 frames per second, making it unusable.. Conclusions If you're looking for a quality device at the sub-$200 price point, the Blu Studio 5.5 is not the one. Sure, it has a physically large display, but the low resolution and poor viewing angles simply ruin the media-consuming experience. It doesn't do anything particularly well. Blu has a range of other devices that we're working through testing right now, including the 4.7-inch Blu Life Play ; the Verykool S470 is also available for around $230. And let's not forget Motorola's just-announced Moto G , a quality midrange phone for $179.. Bottom Line: The Blu Studio 5.5 is a large, unlocked Android smartphone that rings up for less than $200. But in the bargain, you get a low-resolution display and mediocre performance. Patrick Austin knows a thing or two about quirky devices that are more fantastical than practical.

By TheMakeshiftHero , Junior Member on 15th September 2016, 05:13 AM. Today I'll be providing something that seems to be rather scarce throughout the internet. A perfectly clean, untouched, 100% factory stock rom for the blu c5+5 (both the D880U and D890U). Before we get to that, I'd like to clear up some confusion that has plagued this phone since its inception on the market. The infamous D880U, that seems to not exist every time owners try looking for information on it online, unable to find a ROM or even written support for the device, will be exposed today. I'm here to tell you that the D880U doesn't exist. It's a scam, created by GSM service providers such as Bmobile, in contract with BLU. These providers wanted to sell the C5+5 in their respective territories (mostly the Caribbean & South America) as a single-sim device. To do this, they'd often cover one of the sim slots with stickers or plastic that fit perfectly so it was flush, and said you'd void your warranty removing that. Then there's the fake reprinted sticker under the battery, which called the phone a D880U, and only provided you with one IMEI number instead of both. This sticker is placed over the original manufactured label on the back. Some people have already figured out that the D890U ROM works on the D880U. Well that's because the D880U is in fact a D890U. Now let's peel the sticker back:. As you can see, If you've spent months searching for a D880U ROM, you'll be searching for the rest of your life. There seems to be one single dominant D890U ROM going around the internet. It comes pre-rooted with an outdated version of KingRoot when you flash it onto your phone, which prevented you from installing updates for the phone OTA and even locally, making backups etc as well using custom recoveries such as TWRP often ended in failure as none of the partitions can be modified/wiped for some reason. In short, the ROM is jacked up, and this is the ROM you'll see being offered almost everywhere you go. One spanish-speaking site has the stock ROM, but it requires you to pay $30USD. I am here to finally offer a free, simple solution to your problems. It's a beautiful thing to finally get out there:. Install using SP Flash Tools. I hope this helps some of you out..

Join Date: Joined: Sep 2016. I've never seen any of those links. I've never even seen that page in my life. I didn't get a rom from anyone there. You really need to stop fussing like a baby over stuff like this. You (can't even read anything over there, it's all in Spanish), didn't create or patent any android stock roms. This is MY link, on MY MEGA account. I AM sharing this rom, not you or any of your friends. How many roms are uploaded daily in different places by different people? Why are you bugging me? I can't believe you're behaving like someone stole your invention. It's a stock ROM.................. Every other replica of this rom on the internet is not as of a result of you, & you do not deserve credit every time it's posted somewhere. Go try to win points somewhere else please.. i would like to ask where do you get this rom, i was one of the first ones to provide the stock rom and honestly i would like you to give the credit to the person who upload this rom, there are actually some one else who upload the rom and i think he would agree me havign into account i'm not asking more than just the credit, like you said other sites ask you money to get rom and we're doing this for free. you can confirm my words on this link.
