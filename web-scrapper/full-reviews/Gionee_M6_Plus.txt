Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

News Gionee M6, M6 Plus: Hands on and first impressions. Gionee M6, M6 Plus: Hands on and first impressions. The new Gionee M6 and M6 Plus smartphones feature on-device data encryption chip and massive batteries up to 6,020mAh. We go hands on with both smartphones to take a closer look at them.. Updated: July 28, 2016 8:49 AM IST. Gionee M6, M6 Plus design and build. Gionee M6, M6 Plus operating system and performance. Gionee, with its M-series, has focused on smartphones with massive batteries. Late last year, the company launched the M5 and the M5 Plus with massive batteries up to 6,020mAh. Now, at its event in China yesterday, Gionee launched two new smartphones – the M6 and the M6 Plus. Besides upgraded hardware and massive batteries, this time around, Gionee has also focused on making the data on your smartphone secure by using an on device data encryption chip. We were at the launch event in Beijing, China, and after spending some time with both the smartphones, here are our first impressions.. The M6 will set you back by RMB 2,699 (Rs 27,200 approximately) for the 64GB variant, and RMB 2,899 (Rs 29,200 approximately) for the 128GB variant. The M6 Plus, on the other hand, will set you back by RMB 2,999 (Rs 30,200 approximately) for the 64GB variant, and RMB 3,199 (Rs 32,200 approximately) for the 128GB variant. While these smartphones will go on sale starting. in China, there’s no word on the Indian availability yet.. Unlike the M5 and M5 Plus , Gionee has tried to bring some uniformity with the M6 and M6 Plus. Be it the form factor or the hardware that both smartphones run on, there are hardly any. To begin with, both smartphones feature a metal unibody design with chamfered edges on the sides.. Up front, the Gionee M6 features a 5.5-inch full HD (1080p) AMOLED display with 2.5D curved glass, whereas the M6 Plus flaunts a 6-inch full HD (1080p) AMOLED display. The screen is pretty bright and offers a good color reproduction. However, we couldn’t take it under direct sunlight to test its sunlight legibility. Above the screen you have the selfie camera, sensor and earpiece, whereas the physical home button, back and menu buttons are placed below the screen. The physical home button also doubles as a fingerprint scanner for biometric authentication, something that was present in the M5 Plus, but absent from the M5.. The microSD card tray, volume rocker and the power / sleep button are placed on the right edge, whereas the dual SIM card slot tray is on the left edge. The top has the 3.5mm audio jack and an IR blaster to let you control your audio and video devices such as TVs, Hi-Fi systems and more, whereas the bottom has the microUSB port.. Now, on the M6 Plus, Gionee has got rid of the 3.5mm audio jack, instead, the audio is routed via Bluetooth or micro-USB cable. The move is not surprising considering that Apple is rumored to do away with the 3.5mm audio port on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, whereas LeEco has already done that with its Le 2, Le 2 Pro and Le Max2, where audio is routed via the USB Type-C port. However, Gionee opting for a micro-USB port is something that doesn’t quite make sense to me. Ideally, they could have opted for USB Type-C port as it is now close to getting mainstream.. Turn to the back, and you have the camera module, LED flash with Gionee’s new logo below it. The antenna bands running along the top and bottom are also clearly visible. The camera module also has a slight bump and the lens is surrounded with concentric circle pattern, adding up to its aesthetics.. On the whole, Gionee has done a good work with the design of both the smartphones. Also, despite packing such large batteries, Gionee has done a commendable job to keep them sleek and slim. Both smartphones are well built, and feels solid and sturdy too.. The Gionee M6 and M6 Plus are. powered by MediaTek’s 64-bit Helio P10 octa-core SoC and paired with 4GB of RAM. However, there is a slight difference in clock speed – the M6 is clocked at 1.8GHz, whereas the M6 Plus is clocked at 2GHz. Now, I don’t really get why Gionee went ahead with Helio P10 when there are alternatives such as the Helio X10, X20, X25 or Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 650 or Snapdragon 652. In fact, the OnePlus 2 and LeEco Le Max2, both of which are similarly priced as the Gionee M6 and M6 Plus are powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM.. On the storage front, you get 64GB and 128GB onboard storage options, with a microSD card slot that supports further expansion up to 128GB. On the connectivity front, you get dual SIM 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth, GPS and microUSB port. Armed with 5,000mAh and 6,020mAh batteries, Gionee has also included 9V/2A dual-charge chip for fast charging along with reverse charging feature – meaning you use your phone as a power bank to charge other devices.. For shutterbugs, the M6 sports a 13-megapixel rear camera with PDAF and single LED flash, whereas the M6 Plus comes with a slightly higher resolution 16-megapixel rear camera with PDAF and dual tone dual LED flash. For selfie lovers, both smartphones pack an 8-megapixel front facing camera. We did click a few photos from the smartphones at the event, and camera quality looked pretty good. However, we will reserve our judgment until we review the smartphones.. One of the key highlights of the M6 and M6 Plus is the on device encryption chip that adds an extra layer of hardware based security over the usual fingerprint scanner. With integrated security measures, the encryption chip covers RAM, ROM and eFlash (operating system) to ensure that the authentication and encryption related information remains within the chip. While bypassing encryption on software level is easy, the on device encryption chip will prevent hackers from gaining control over your data, Gionee says.. Also, if the chip suffers from any external damage, the hacker won’t be able to decrypt the encrypted data. This hardware based encryption chip will safeguard all your data including call records, photos, notes, documents and more. Unfortunately, the feature is China specific and in regions such as India, users will only get data protection in the form of a fingerprint scanner. Gionee’s William Lu went ahead to clarify that due to the regulatory restrictions in India and lack of required government approvals, the feature won’t make it to the Indian markets.. Both smartphones run on Amigo OS 3.2 based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. The UI is pretty simple with no app drawer – all installed apps appear on different home screens. The interface was pretty smooth and during our 15 minutes usage, we did not notice any lag or stuttering. However, with limited number of apps installed on the device, we could not test the smartphones by playing games or doing some multi tasking on it.. Overall, both the M6 and M6 Plus come with a good design, sleek body and sturdy build quality. Gionee has packed in good amount of RAM and onboard storage options along with massive batteries. However, one of the key features of the smartphones, on-device data encryption chip, won’t be supported in India. Also, with approximate price ranging between Rs 27,200 to Rs 32,200, the addition of Helio P10 cannot justify its hefty price tag. It is will likely face fierce competition from the likes of OnePlus 3, LeEco Le Max2, Xiaomi Redmi Note and Mi 5 are available approximately in the same price range. Now it remains to be seen how the smartphones perform in real work usage, which we will only come to know when we review them.

Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features Digital zoom, Geo tagging.

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

Gionee M6 Plus Review, Price and Specifications. Gionee M6 Plus is a huge phone with a huge battery. If either of the two attributes as mentioned above add spark to your eyes, the Marathon M6 Plus is worth considering. Isn't that what the Gionee Marathon M5 Plus was all about?. And even when Gionee isn't using the 'Marathon' moniker anymore, the M6 Plus is an iterative refinement over the Marathon M5 Plus. The design doesn't deviate much from the set course, except for a few refinements. For instance, the loudspeaker grill on the rear in Marathon M5 Plus has now been shifted on the bottom edge in M6 Plus where it makes more sense. Within its metal casing, the dual SIM handset houses a 6020mAh battery. On the front, Gionee is using a 6-inch AMOLED panel with 1080p full HD resolution. A physical home button with a fingerprint sensor is also present on the front. The M6 Plus is powered by Helio P10, which has proved to be a power efficient chipset (not much of a heavy lifter though) so far. For photography, there is 13MP rear camera with LED flash, f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, Sony IMX258 sensor and an 8MP front camera for selfies. Other features include 4G LTE with VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) with Amigo OS 3.5. The lowest price of Gionee M6 Plus in India is expected to be around 30,000 INR. The handset is supposed to be available in India very soon.. Huge battery capacity Amoled display Fingerprint sensor Dual SIM support and 4G LTE. No reviews found for this mobile. Be the first to write a review.. Enter each Pro in new line..

I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. ubiquitous and an intrinsic part of our lives, the importance of mobile security grow increasingly paramount. Think about how much of our life is stored in that little device -- private conversations and photos with loved ones; financial and employment information; detailed records of our daily habits. Gionee has made mobile security the highest priority with. its newest smartphone, the M6 (and its bigger brother M6 Plus).. The Shenzhen company bills the device as "the world's safest smartphone," a claim based off the fact that the M6 is the first mass produced phone in the world to have a 128-bit hardware encryption chip.. Look, Gionee's drive to provide extra security for smartphone is not entirely an altruistic one -- part of this direction is to distinguish the M6 from the flood of new Android phones on the market, many of which are very excellent devices. But for those of you who really are constantly concerned about the threat of cybercrime, Gionee's new phone should ease your concerns a bit.. I've been using the M6 and the M6 Plus for a little over a week. It's a very nicely-built phone, but as I just ranted about in an earlier post -- it's getting pointless to spend. a big chunk of a review on. how "premium" a new phone feels because every phone in 2016 looks and feels premium. So yeah, if you've held an. 10 or a Huawei P9 or a Meizu Pro 6 or a OnePlus 3, you know how it feels. It's metal and sturdy, every bit as solid-feeling as an iPhone.. The Gionee M6 Plus (left) and the Gionee M6 (right) with an iPhone 6. The M6 is, however, a bit thicker and heavier than most other phones at 8.2mm and 6.3 oz (the M6 Plus has the same thickness but weighs 7.5oz).. That's because it's got an enormous battery (M6 has a 5,020 mAH; M6 Plus has 6,020 mAH). Gionee says the M6's battery can power video playback up to six and half hours. My tests showed that it came up a bit short, at around five hours 50-ish minutes. If you're not watching videos non-stop, the phone should last well over two days on normal use.. The device runs a heavily skinned Android 6.0, powered by a. MT6755 Helio P10 chip (same for the Plus. For simplicity sake, for the rest of this piece, all things said about the M6 can apply to the M6 Plus unless stated otherwise). I'm not the biggest fan of the software, but it runs smooth and in my week of using I never experienced any lag. Apps all zip open, even during heavy use. 1080 x 1920 display (the M6 Plus's screen is bumped up to 6-inches) that's bright and more than sharp enough. on the Quad HD bandwagon too, but Chinese phones like Huawei P9, OnePlus 3 and Meizu MX6 have really showed me that. 2,560 x 1,440 really is overkill for a five- to six-inch screen. In terms of specs and features, the M6 ticks all the boxes:. 13MP, f/2.0 lens for the M6 (16MP and f/1.8 for the Plus), and 8MP selfie cams for both.. The device uses hardware buttons, but while the "back" and "recent apps" buttons are touch-sensitive, the home button (which also doubles as fingerprint sensor) requires pressing. It's an awkward setup that will take a bit of time to get used to..

Gionee M6 and M6 Plus First Impressions Review: A Mixed Bag That's Secure. Gionee has launched its next generation M devices in China, the M6 and the M6 Plus. We got to play with both these phones at the launch event in Beijing, China and here's what we think about them.. Updated: July 26, 2016, 4:30 PM IST. Siddhartha Sharma | News18.com SidnChips. RIP Sridevi: Remembering Bollywood's First Female Superstar Virtuosity:The Legendary Sridevi in Her Own Words Veteran Actor Sridevi Passes Away at 54 After Cardiac Arrest in Dubai Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety: Is The Misogyny Served Worth Your Money?. Gionee has launched its next generation M devices in China, the M6 and M6 Plus. Both the devices will also be launching in India soon.. We got to play with both these phones at the launch event in Beijing, China and here's what we think about them.. First, let's tell you what's the difference between both these phones. The Gionee M6 comes with a 5.5-inch AMOLED display whereas the M6 Plus comes with a massive 6-inch display.. The displays on both the phones are superbright and slightly reflective as well. Overall, they offer good viewing angles. But if you like watching videos or stream videos on your phone the M6 Plus is the screen size to get.. The Gionee M6 comes with a 5000mAh battery and the M6 Plus gets a 6020mAh massive battery capacity.. Both the phones come with USB Type-C for charging and data transfer. Despite that the M6 comes with a 3.5mm audio jack but the M6 Plus misses out on one. Both the phones are CDLA audio compatible as well.. The Gionee M6 comes with a regular headphone jack but the M6 Plus does not. Interestingly Gionee has gone for encrypted chip inside the phone that ensure the user data to stay secured at all times. It's like the second layer for data protection besides the fingerprint sensor that the phone comes with.. This in a way makes it the most secured android phone in the world but only for China. As the overseas versions will not come with it and will have just a fingerprint sensor. So technically, they won't be the word's most secured devices in India.. The phone also sports a well built unibody design with really smooth edges. The M6 is easier to hold and keep in your pocket but the massive M6 Plus is a bit too much for both.. The Gionee M6 Plus comes with a 6-inch display and 6020mAh battery. In a world where every smartphone manufacturer is going for a Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset, Gionee uses a MediaTek processor on both the phones and has coupled it with 4GB RAM. In our little use the phone did seem to be smooth and the Gionee Amigo UI was not that interfering.. The 13 MP rear camera on both the phones are good enough for everyday use and the images that we clicked were to our satisfaction. But the images looked way better on the M6 Plus. For selfies the 8 MP camera works well.. The phones will be available for sale in India by the end of October or early November 2016.. android smartphone Gionee M6 Gionee M6 First Impressions Gionee M6 Plus. Next Story Next Story.

Gionee believes its M6 and M6 Plus are the most secure phones around. Chinese phone manufacturer Gionee wants you to forget phones like the Blackphone , the Turing Phone , and the BlackBerry Priv, since the company believes its recently announced M6 and M6 Plus flagships are the most secure phones around.. The biggest selling point for both phones is a data encryption chip that Gionee says will protect everything from call records, to photos and documents, to notes and other sensitive information. along with more specific details, are currently unknown, though Gionee. did say that the chip is similar to the “secure element” used to store data related to Apple Pay, albeit far more encompassing in the types of stored data. The company also mentioned the chip will protect M6 and M6 Plus owners from Android malware.. As for the phones themselves, the M6 goes first with its 5.5-inch, 1,920 x 1,080 resolution AMOLED display, 8-megapixel selfie camera, and 13MP main shooter with phase detection auto-focus and dual-tone LED flash. Elsewhere, a 1.8GHz octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 chipset and 4GB RAM power the M6, with either 64GB or 128GB of native storage expandable by up to an additional 128GB through the Micro SD card slot.. Impressively, the M6 houses a huge 5,000mAh battery, which Gionee claims will provide up to 6.4 hours of video, 55 hours of continuous phone calls, and 33 days of standby time. Furthermore, thanks to fast-charging technology, the battery goes from zero to 100 in two hours. Finally, the M6 runs Android Marshmallow out of the box, though you will not recognize it since Gionee opts to layer its Amigo 3.5 OS on top of it.. Moving on to the M6 Plus, the phone stays true to its name by opting for a larger 6-inch, 1,920 x 1,080 resolution AMOLED display. As for the cameras, the selfie camera remains at 8MP, though the main shooter gets a nice bump to 16MP. Finally, the larger size of the M6 Plus allows it to stuff a larger 6,020mAh battery, with. The M6 and M6 Plus will not be the most affordable phones around, particularly as far as Chinese phones are concerned, but. their respective $404 and $434 prices are still impressive price points to hit. Unfortunately, there seems to be a discrepancy between Chinese and global models of the two phones, as the data encryption chip. is not included in the global versions..

Gionee M6 and M6 Plus unveiled: huge phones, huge batteries. Gionee launched a metal-clad duo that is tight on security and imposingly big.. The "small" Gionee M6 features a 5.5" AMOLED screen and a substantial 5,000mAh battery. It's generous with memory too - 4GB of RAM and 32GB, 64GB or even 128GB storage.. The M6 is powered by an octa-core processor ticking at 1.8GHz. On the back is a 13MP camera with a dual-LED flash and a fingerprint reader.. The Gionee M6 Plus ups the screen to 6" big - AMOLED again with 1080p resolution. Both phones support reverse charging, that is they work like battery packs and charge other devices.. The M6 Plus also has a slightly faster chipset, its octa-core processor is at 2GHz. It comes with 4GB of RAM, but only 64GB storage is mentioned (I doubt there won't be a 128GB version for this one).. Both Gionees have a dedicated security chip that offers 10 layers of protection for your personal data. The fingerprint reader is only part of the security.. Note that neither phone has a 3.5mm audio jack.. Both M6 models will debut in China, but they should venture out to other markets too. Unfortunately, we don't have dates or prices..

These days, privacy is no longer a simple matter and people, especially in “hot” areas can no longer simply presume their comings and goings aren’t being monitored. While there are things like VPNs to keep Web traffic safe and private, the same cannot be said about smartphones. Chinese manufacturer Gionee believes that the market is ready, and in fact hungry, for a truly safe, secure, and private smartphone. That’s the promise it is making with the new Gionee M6 and Gionee M6 Plus, dubbing it the safest smartphone in the world.. A lot of smartphones these days employ various security and privacy features, from fingerprint sensors like Apple’s Touch ID, to secure “silos”, like Samsung’s KNOX. The Gionee M6 and M6 Plus takes all those and stretches them far and wide, presenting users with a variety of features to keep hackers and eavesdroppers away. For one, it is very proud of its hardware encryption which, of course, beats software-based encryption. That said, a few high end smartphones do implement that as well. Gionee, however, also explains that each chip is bound to each phone’s CPU, so transplanting the chip to another phone, even another M6 or M6 Plus, won’t help to break its encryption.. Gionee also provides what it dubs as Privacy Vault 2.0, which lets users hide important private information behind a password or a fingerprint, using that same hardware encryption to keep data safe even after the smartphone has been stolen. Users can also put a password on apps so that others can’t open them at all. The Gionee M6, however, goes the extra mile by even including a feature to encrypt voice calls, called Private Line Calling. It’s a point-to-point, again hardware-based, encryption system that would sound like gibberish to those trying to eavesdrop on your conversation.. Aside from those security and privacy measure, the Gionee M6 and M6 Plus both boast of extremely capable batteries, 5,000 mAh and 6,020 mAh, respectively. Despite their large sizes, which are probably the largest in the smartphone market, Gionee promises fast charging with 12V/2A and 9V/2A Quick Charge for the M6 Plus and M6, respectively, protected by dual charging chips to ensure you get the right amount of charge, not too little, not too much. That does give the smartphones a bit of girth, though Gionee downplays how much. The smartphones are 8.2 mm thick, which is actually quite thick if you compare it to the iPhone 6s Plus’ 7.3 mm or even the Galaxy S7 edge’s 7.7 mm. You do pay the price for longer battery life. That said, the Gionee M6 siblings can also be used to charge other devices, a rare feature for a non USB-C device.. As for the rest of the specs, the Gionee M6 and M6 Plus are a mix of high end and mid-range specs. They are both powered by an octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 MT6755m, though the Gionee M6 is clocked lower. Both do have 4 GB of RAM. and 64 or 128 GB of internal storage. Both also have 1920×1080 Full HD screens, though the Gionee M6 gets a smaller 5.5 inch panel compared to the M6 Plus’ 6.0 inches. And again, both have the same 8 megapixel front shooter, but the Gionee M6 Plus sports a higher 16 megapixel main camera while the Gionee M6 settles for 13 megapixels..
