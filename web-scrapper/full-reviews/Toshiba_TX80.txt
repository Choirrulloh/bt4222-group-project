Hi Toshiba ur's TX80 is a mobile phone or a calculator...such a UGLY phone I ever seen...should take my advise....stop making mobile phone.... felix, 15 Jan 2008 i bouhgt 904t for my girlfriend and 911t for me,there's nothing better then toshibas and sharp... more your right there they have always been stealing idea's. i bouhgt 904t for my girlfriend and 911t for me,there's nothing better then toshibas and sharps,nokia never again,nokia just stilling ideas from japanese mobile market. Currently living in Japan, so I bought the Japanese version. Got it cuz I wanted a good camera and good music player all on one phone, and also one that can type in Japanese for practice as well as will work in the US (have to pay to get it unlocked somewhere). (keep in mind this is the Japanese version, Softbank 811T). -Music player only plays mp4 files (it comes with a program for converting but it has trouble installing on non-japanese installs of windows. i got it to work but it won't recognize japanese/chinese/korean text in song files)--notice: this con may not be applicable to the non-japanese version. -Camera has no auto focus, not great flash. -3mp camera has great quality most of the time. -Music player is pretty good, has equalizer and is quite usable (first phone mp3 player i've used so take this for what its worth). -Can control music player without opening phone via buttons on outside. -Easy to press/see buttons (fully backlit too). -Good size (not huge, esp considering the wealth of features). -Outside lights for notification of new emails etc. -Supports video call with secondary front-mounted vga camera. -Upgradable/removeable memory (mirco sd card, max size as of Oct. Personally I have always wanted a phone that would be my music player, camera, and phone, and not suck. With the nice 3mp camera (even with no auto focus and not much of a flash) and the music player (which I find just fine) I am quite happy with this phone. No bluetooth support is kind of stupid and a big pain for some.. I personally am ok with it. The Japanese one DOES make a sound when you take a picture, although it's not very loud. I keep it on vibrate most of the time but I don't feel like the ring is exceptionally loud. Hope this helps, sry it's the Japanese version.. Does the 811T have the same mobile charger as the 903SH? I really want to know! I really like the look of the orange one.. Just bought TX80 in red color, which is a japanese version with Chinese firmware. Overall, the phone is nice in terms of sound(via headphone), screen, build quality and reception quality. The only drawback is the absence of the bluetooth. With just few japanese phone in the market, we cannot be too demanding for them. I would still recommend this phone to everyone.. Does anyone know what the sound is like on this mobile? Is it loud?. Scary, looks like a baby moniter. Or something you can get in a pound shop. bought it, everythings good cept that no bluetooth kinda sucks when sending stuff and no autofocus makes it kinda hard to take pics. But other than that the white ones look very very nice. Everyone loves it, just a lil bit quiet tho in my opinion.. too complicated and the sound its too low, I never awser my calling because I cant hear the phone ringing!. Does the internet and the picture messaging only work in Japan?.. Thinking about buying this phone but worried it wont work with my needs.And also, does it take both t-mobile and Cingular..I may switch.---please answer.I am in need of another phone I need help.. I heard the phone doesn't have shutter sound when you take a picture. The sample photos look nice as well. Too bad it doesn't have bluetooth.. u could find it on ebay for $300. 400$ for this phone good deal if u dont mind the absence of bluetooth. 400$ in the US or canada or where?. I actually quite like the white one. And the camera quality with this phone is superb. But then again, it's quite pricey >_. I can get this phone for $400, is it worth it? ANYONE?. Pages: 1 2 ».

Nokia 105 and 301 candybar phones announced at MWC, offer simplicity on the cheap. Panic's Candy Bar is now free, goes to Iconfactory. Alcatel OT-915 with QWERTY keyboard, Gingerbread said to be launching at MWC. LG's triple SIM A290: the phone every Russian Casanova needs. The goodness coming out of Hong Kong's ITU Telecom World 2006 continues, and this time it's Toshiba flaunting the hardware. Their new TX80 and TS32 are both destined for Hong Kong's own SmarTone-Vodafone, and Toshiba seems pretty confident about the launches -- the senior VP of its mobile group even went so far to say that these are "just the phones that people in Hong Kong want and need." We're a little skeptical about the claim, though, seeing how the TS32 doesn't even do 3G, instead topping out with EDGE on the 900, 1800, and 1900MHz bands. Other features include a 1.3 megapixel cam, microSD slot, and Bluetooth in the buyer's choice of Lunar Graphite, Desert Gold, and Midnight Purple. The TX80 is the more exciting of the pair, bringing 3G data, dedicated music controls, and a more respectable 3.2 megapixel shooter. Both should be available now across Hong Kong, though we don't envision much of a rush for either phone. Sorry, Toshiba!

Gearfuse Technology, Science, Culture & More. Spot Review: Toshiba TX80 UMTS phone. 3G 811T cellphone cellphones review smartone-vodafone toshiba TX80 UMTS 2006-12-27. Gearfuse is bringing you reviews that you have never seen before, we call them spot reviews. No boos and no fancy paragraphs going on and on. Everything is kept in a precise and concise manner, covering absolutely everything you need to know whether you were thinking of buying or not. As we announced it a few days ago, here is the exclusive spot review of the TX80 phone, first in any non-Asian language site on the internet.. Background: Migration of the Softbank 811T model from Softbank Japan (ex-Vodafone KK Japan).. Market positioning: Mid-range music 3G phone. Market availability: Currently it is being sold by SmarTone-Vodafone in Hong Kong, we are also expecting it to be carried by FarEasTone in Taiwan, and hopefully by Vodafone in Europe.. Market price: 290 to 480USD depending on contract, which is way over priced.. SIM unlockable: yes, by paying SmarTone-Vodafone.. Size and weight: (96 x 49 x 19.6mm 111g) Typical Japanese clamshell size, we consider the overall span reasonable with the 2.4� screen size and 3.2 Megapixel camera. Fairly pocketable thanks to the thinness.. The pink color scheme might appeal more to girls, also soothes up the weird design.. Design: funny looking and not the most attractive out there, you either like it or hate it. The Music buttons are arranged as a 4 directional key found on the surface between the stereo speakers. Shutter key, volume keys and Infrared port are found on the right. The microSD slot and headset jack are found on the left. Battery at the bottom, camera and LED flash module with manual macro/portrait focusing switch at the back.. Signal LEDs: These are multi-color lights found at each side of the hinge and are used to signal battery charging status, incoming calls, new messages and dropped calls. The lights will blink until you flip open the phone and acknowledge these missed events. This is a typical set-up on Japanese-Japanese phones, really handy when you leave the phone on the desk when you�re away, or turning off even the vibration in a serious meeting. This is something that we feel that European manufacturers might want to follow.. Keypad: huge keys measuring 13 by 6mm, good tactile feedback towards the soft side, extremely comfortable for SMS addicts. Backlight is blue, even and sufficient.. Built and durability: excellent built, no glitches at all. Shinny surface not prone to fingerprints. We didn�t manage to scratch it even by carrying it around in jeans pocket for 7 days.. Eyes to see, ears to hear. Main screen: 2.4� 262K TFT main display, brightness and color are great. However colors will fade under direct sunlight, visibility further limited by lack of anti-reflective coating.. Sub display: The 0.9� monochrome OLED displays basic information such as date and time, missed calls and new message arrival on standby, and also track information when playing music. Visibility under direct sunlight is good.. Camera(s): 3.2 Megapixels CMOS, with manual focus switch that you can choose between macro and normal; the power of LED flash is average. You can also use the internal VGA camera to take pictures of yourself.. Picture taking: Overall the camera is really speedy. To turn on the camera, you can either press and hold the shutter button at the side, or dig in the menu. The camera mode takes about 2 seconds to start up, shutter lag is less than half a second, saving a full resolution picture takes about 3 seconds. Other options such as night mode, self-timer, white balance, color control (light, intense, neutral) picture effects (sepia, black and white), exposure (-2 to +2) and date stamp are all in place. You may use resolutions from 96 x 128 to 2048 x 1536. The maximum digital zoom is 12.8 times. Shutter sound can be turned off. Picture quality turned out great, even with the fixed focus lens, most images are sufficiently sharp. Night performance is well above average. Auto white balance is generally accurate outdoor, but it seemed to have some problems indoor. Personally I would say that pictures are comparable to Nokia N80, but loses out to SonyEricsson K800i in terms of sharpness, accuracy of color reproduction as well as flash (xenon vs LED). Full sized picture samples coming up soon, once the line is fixed after the earthquake.. Video recording: Videos can be recorded in QVGA or 176×144 resolutions. Since the format supported here is 3G2, the sound quality won�t be the best. The videos taken however, are quite smooth.. Ringtone: the use of MP3 files are unlimited, say buh-bye to stupid DRM. The 64 chords polyphony came out with great quality, too bad the volume is even softer than the Sharp 903.. Music formats supported: AMR-NB, AAC-LC, HE-AAC, MP3. Music functions: The music interface is intuitive and background playback is supported. Sound quality is on pair with SonyEricsson Walkman phones (i.e. no hiss, unlike the Nokia 5300). The bundled remote allows users to move around tracks and adjust the volume without taking the phone out of the pocket, and also attached your favorite headphones to the other end. It is a pity that there are no equalizers built in and Bluetooth A2DP profile is not supported. These two have discredited part of TX80�s �music phone� claim.. Streaming media: this actually has more to do with the reception, where we found no fault with.. User interface: similar looking to Vodafone�s standard interface. Red bar at the bottom cannot be removed, apart from the stand-by screen, where the softkeys are transparent. There are 4 themes built in, but users cannot download or install new themes themselves. Memory: 40MB internal memory plus microSD supporting up to 1GB.. Frequencies and band: UMTS 2100, triband GSM 900/1800/1900. Data: UMTS, GPRS class 10, no EDGE. Reception: excellent, no hisses and no drop calls.. Miscellaneous functions supported: speaker phone, flight mode. Miscellaneous functions not supported: voice dial, voice command. Battery life: 330hours of standby translates to approximately 3 and a half day of what we consider average usage. Streaming multimedia over the network is extremely power hungry. Toshiba also claimed that voice calls can last up to 6 hours, just to give you an idea.. Can also act as a modem for your laptop.. Come on, how expensive is a Bluetooth module, 3USD?. USB2.0: the TX80 can act as a card reader/writer for the microSD card for your PC.. PIM programs: Calculator, converter, world clock, alarm, voice recorder, countdown timer, notepad; also supports backing up contact list and calendar entries on to memory card. Browser: WAP only, no full Html browsers built in.. Games: JAVA MIDP2 supported, SmarTone-Vodafone�s GSX 3D game engine supported. We have generally found not fault with the TX8, just a couple of missing features. The lack of Bluetooth is perhaps the biggest deal breaker here (given it’s retail price). The camera worked well (which you will see, once we have the graphics up), reception is great, battery life is above average for a phone at its class… but really, don’t expect too much on top of the usual phone functions.

Is there a fast way to activate the camera mode or is it buried in menus? Does the phone have to be flipped open to use the camera? Finally, can you comment on continous shooting mode – is it full resolution, fast, can you choose which shots to save or does it just save as long as you hold the button?. December 27, 2006 at 1:06 pm. Thanks for your inquiry, updated paragraph. “To turn on the camera, you can either press and hold the shutter button at the side, or dig in the menu. The camera mode takes about 2 seconds to start up, shutter lag is less than half a second, saving a full resolution picture takes about 3 seconds. Other options such as night mode, self-timer, white balance, color control (light, intense, neutral) picture effects (sepia, black and white), exposure (-2 to +2) and date stamp are all in place. You may use resolutions from 96 x 128 to 2048 x 1536. The maximum digital zoom is 12.8 times. Shutter sound can be turned off. Picture quality turned out great, even with the fixed focus lens, most images are sufficiently sharp. Night performance is well above average. Auto white balance is generally accurate outdoor, but it seemed to have some problems indoor. Personally I would say that pictures are comparable to Nokia N80, but loses out to SonyEricsson K800i in terms of sharpness, accuracy of color reproduction as well as flash (xenon vs LED). Full sized picture samples coming up soon, once the line is fixed after the earthquake.”. yes the phone has to be flipped open in order to use the camera, since the screen cannot swivel and the ext OLED cannot act as a viewfinder. March 13, 2007 at 11:03 pm. 1) Is the Memory card hot swap?. 2) Does the Navi GPS software work for countries like in Canada? or is it locked only for Japan Softbank?. March 14, 2007 at 9:20 pm. There is no GPS on the TX80, so the GPS is found on the Japanese version, and is locked to Japan. the memory card is of course hot-swappable. April 6, 2007 at 1:08 am. for the battery life, how many hours would you say if I only used this cell phone to play music (flight mode)?. April 7, 2007 at 6:50 am. There’s no official data on that, but it won’t last as long as SonyEricsson’s Walkman phones for sure. April 10, 2007 at 11:16 pm. is the re-sell value of this phone high?. April 11, 2007 at 1:47 pm. Depends on where you’re selling it, and what’s gonna come out in the market in the coming months. Nobody knew that the Sharp 903 still managed to top most camera reviews 2 years after its launch, because of its large AND CCD sensor.. comparably the TX80 does not have as much flare, a 3MP Nokia s60 flip phone down the line can easily take over the interest.. June 24, 2007 at 11:56 am. I just purchased a TX80 and I’m pretty impressed with the display. Its as good as Sharp’s Aquos and the screen is big too. However I’m wondering if you can download wallpapers onto the phone? Currently, I’m forced to use one of the four default themes.. I also saw a couple of people have uploaded videos (or movies) onto the phone. Finally, the sample pictures you took above look great but my pictures turn out blurry all the time. I find one needs to have a very steady hand and because it does not have AF affects the picture quality a lot.. June 24, 2007 at 11:33 pm. You can of course download wallpapers onto the phone (from ur PC to memory card, or from online sites), and set them as wallpaper from the options menu, just like all other phones, select your pic, click options, set-as, wallpaper. conversely go to settings>display>wallpaer and select your own file. this feature should be on 99.9999% of phones in the market.. videos: copy them (in 3GP) into the memory card, get a card reader, put them onto the same folder as where the videos taken by the camera would appear.. Yes you need steady hands to take pictures for all camera phones…. no matter how expensive/ cheap they are.. June 25, 2007 at 2:17 am. Do you know where I can get a free 3GP converter. So far I’ve used Alive 3GP video converter (that works) but its only trial version.. August 9, 2007 at 9:54 am. How about the sound quality, music player MP3 quality?. I heard from others that Toshiba mobile got a problem with Mp3 player because it will only play DRM-free AAC and fixed bit-rate MP3 files and for a phone with serious music-playing pretentions that�s a big limitation. They tried loading some variable bit rate (VBR) encoded tunes, which give better sound quality for the file size and the phone simply refused to play them. Leave a Reply Cancel reply.
