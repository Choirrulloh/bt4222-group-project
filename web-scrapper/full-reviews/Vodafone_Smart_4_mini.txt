The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Smart about price, not so smart on the features. Value is the focus of this entry-level smartphone. The low cost and good battery life are offset by a poor camera and slow UI, but at the price it's hard to complain.. Not too long ago smartphones were the preserve of the gadget elite with browsing, email and push notifications on the go requiring a hefty upfront cost.. That has all disappeared now: handsets such as the Motorola Moto G and Nokia Lumia 520 have given us smart functionality for as little as £150.. The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini takes this idea to the extreme, offering you a full smartphone experience for only £50 up front. We're down in territory belonging to the £40 Nokia Asha 503 and the £70 Samsung Galaxy Young .. We've seen the competition at the lower end of the market heat up dramatically over the last couple of years and it's now eminently possible to get a handset for less than the price of a tank of petrol.. The PAYG Vodafone Smart 4 Mini is about as far from the premium HTC One M8 or Samsung Galaxy S5 as it's possible to get. It may not be up to the task of being your primary handset, but as a secondary device for emergencies or holidays, it has everything you'll need.. Of course, the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini is locked to Vodafone - so if you're in a poor reception area for the red network you might want to give it a miss.. This isn't Vodafone's first Smart handset and in terms of design, it's almost identical to last year's Vodafone Smart Mini.. The boxy black chassis means it's far from the best-looking budget mobile out there and with dimensions of 122 x 64 x 12mm it can't claim to be thin either.. However, the handset is light at 111g. Build quality is middling - there's a bit of flex on the chassis when you push down on it - but it seems robust enough to survive drops and bumps without undue damage.. There are two physical buttons on the phone. The first is the power switch located on the top of the handset next to the 3.5mm headphone jack, and the second is the volume rocker on the right hand side.. Both have a reassuringly deep click to them and, as with many Android handsets, the volume down part of the rocker can be used as a dedicated shutter button when in camera mode.. The Back, Home and Settings buttons are soft-touch keys at the bottom of the 800 x 480, 4-inch WVGA screen which is, unfortunately, surrounded by a chunky black bezel that does nothing for the aesthetic of the Smart 4 Mini.. Don't expect any high-definition visuals here, and the colour contrast is quite weak - but the welcome upshot of those limitations is that battery life remains strong.. Turn the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini over and the removable plastic back has been given a smart, light grey colour. It features the Vodafone logo as well as the camera lens and the speaker.. There's also Google's logo to denote that the phone is Google-certified and has access to the full range of Google Play apps.. It's undoubtedly a cheap plastic construction, but to give the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini its due, it sits comfortably in the palm and the 4-inch screen means you can operate it comfortably with just one hand.. As you'd expect for £50, the internal specifications are about as inspiring as the design. You're only given 4GB of internal storage to play with although Vodafone has included a microSD card slot underneath the 1400mAh battery for boosting storage.. A 1.3GHz dual-core processor is under the hood, backed with 512MB of RAM. This doesn't make for blistering performance and there's no option for 4G on this handset.. However, as I said earlier, if you're looking at this as an option for a secondary phone then the lack of muscle is a standard trade-off for the rock bottom price tag.. Next Page Key features.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars Impressive budget Android smartphone. I've never used a mobile phone enough to justify a monthly contract but given the number of free Wi-Fi hotspots now available when out and about, I wanted a cheap PAYG smartphone that could get me online and also double as an MP3 player. I searched around and was surprised at the specifications of this for the price - 1.3 GHz Dual core processor, Android 4.2.2 (Jellybean) and its capacity can be extended with a MicroSD card. It uses a standard SIM card (not a micro) and it comes with one in the box (I fitted my existing 10 year old Vodafone SIM). As a phone it works fine and is straightforward to use. I also inserted a 128GB MicroSD card and despite the literature stating that only external storage up to 32GB is accepted, it works to it's FULL capacity. It's very FAST, launching and switching effortlessly between apps - you can have a lot going on but it copes with ease. It only has a 4GB internal capacity but you can transfer some apps to a MicroSD card and run them from there. I don't know what the criteria is, but some can be moved to a MicroSD card (BBC iPlayer, BBC iPlayer Radio, Amazon Music, Netflix, Skype, etc) and some can't (4oD, Spotify, Facebook, Amazon Instant Video, ITV Player, etc). If you transfer the BBC iPlayer app to a MicroSD card, any programmes downloaded are saved within the app on the MicroSD card. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth function as they should. If you need to use the GPS, install the Nokia Here Maps app and their UK map (they're both free) - it works perfectly without having to be connected to the Internet. It's been 100% accurate every time I've used it. As an MP3 player it sounds fine but the volume does not go as loud as other players I've used. It has an FM radio too and the reception is perfect. You need to plug in headphones (a cheap pair are included) to use the radio. The display is excellent and the screen doesn't feel cheap but you've got to be really accurate when using the keyboard. The overall build quality is good and just to confirm, the front facing camera is 3.2 mega pixel and there is no flash or back facing camera. The battery life is OK (around four hours when constantly surfing the web whilst listening to music at the same time) and in stand-by mode with the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and display switched off it lasts for days instead of hours. In summary, this is an absolute bargain. It's not quite perfect but it's amazing value for money compared to similar Andoid smartphones and it should more than meet the needs of anyone after an inexpensive but by no means basic PAYG smartphone..

I've waited a few days before posting this as I wanted to see how it worked. I bought this to replace a very nice Sony Xperia which completely died very unexpectedly after 5 months and Vodafone refused to honour the warranty... Anyway, this phone has it's problems. it is temperamental; sometimes apps crash, sometimes the phone gets confused about opening and closing apps... best thing to do it shut it down and re-open. The roaming data is awful, I haven't made it connect properly once (so am saving money from those Vodafone gits). The camera is ok but not great, even instagram pics are looking a little wishy washy. But when attached to wi-fi it's not bad and it is very easy to use. I've been very honest about the short comings... but for £30? It's really not that bad, I've had worse smart phones that cost more than twice as much. This will see me through to the end of my contract with those thieving gits form vodafone.

I was looking for a a product to us as an alternative to my expensive smart phone to be used in the garden as an MP3 player. This smart phone is a cost effective solution. For only £15 (plus the micro sd card I have put in it) I can now listen to my music through headphones or using the bluetooth function to one of my speakers. If it gets damaged or rained on its not a £400 loss. Took a while to get set up properly and it does seem to lose wifi conectivity fairly regularly, but I can live with this for what I want to use it for..

Everything went well for the first few weeks and then one day I tried to use it and was told I had no credit. I had topped up the week before so I knew there was money there. The local Vodaphone shop told me that I had made a 286 minute call to someone called "Norma" that had effectively used up all my credit. Not possible! When I complained (the phone was in a case and therefore protected from any accidental phone calls being made) they just said that it "sometimes happens" - no apology, no refund. I have now gone back to using my old phone where this has never happened in years of use. So much for wanting to look trendy!!. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars I actually thought it was too good to be true as I got it for £30 .... Brought this for my mother as she needed up grading to an android but didn't want to pay the prices as she wouldn't use it as much as most would. I actually thought it was too good to be true as I got it for £30 and you can get it unlocked really easily on eBay for 1p the phone is as fast as my daughters samsung s3 and does just as much. Photos are good takes a bit of getting used to how it works but I was really impressed. The only down side it has one fault. The clock chimes beeps what every you have it set to on the hour every hour ( even at night) which means you have to keep it on silent if you have it by your bed or working etc as it can not be turned off we googled it and it seems to be what everyone complains about. ( for my mother who doesn't have her phone by her bed or use it as an alarm like some do it wasn't a problem ) but this may be an issue for some. Over all I would say it's a bargin. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars As a cheap holiday phone really good, got unlock code from eBay for 99p really ....

Notice: Phone scammers are posing as WhistleOut. Can do just about anything you'd expect from a more expensive smartphone. Looks and feels as cheap as it is. When it comes to the price of a new smartphone; a device capable of accessing the entirety of the world wide web, of playing games and watching movies — how low can you go? Vodafone is selling the new Smart Mini 4 for $69 including a month’s pre-paid service. This is an amazing price, but what exactly do you get for your money? Can a smartphone worth using really be this cheap?. It probably goes without saying, but there is nothing about the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini (VS4M) that stands out being the price tag. In design, the VS4M is about as utilitarian as it gets. A small, black plastic box with a 4-inch touchscreen on the front, and a small camera lens on the back, next to a speaker grille.. There are three touch-sensitive controls on the front of the phone, below the screen, used for Back, Home and Menu operations. You can plug your own headphones into the handset via its 3.5mm socket on the top, and you charge the phone with a micro USB port on the bottom.. If you pull the gun-metal coloured battery cover off you’ll find a Mini SIM sized slot and a section for a micro SD memory card underneath the battery.. In so many ways, the VS4M reminds us of the sorts of smartphones we used to see 5 years ago, when the same handset design would have cost four or fives times as much at retail.. The 4-inch display is the real make or break point, we feel. If you can put up with the dim colours, poor contrast and sticky-feeling touchscreen, then you’ll consider the Mini 4 an absolute bargain. More discerning tech lovers may refuse to use the VSM4 regardless of its bargain bin price.. It’s poor viewing angles are its weakest element and are central to answering the questions: “why is this phone so cheap?”. Tilting the screen away from your face produces a negative effect on screen making it difficult to read and make selections. Titling it vertically, towards your body, is the worst direction, and the screen is unusable at subtle angles in this direction. Side to side is better, but not much.. The display panel is also set into from the glass, which gives light a space to bounce about. This is one of the reasons why the screen appears so dull, but it is also behind the high level of reflections which are always getting in the way of you seeing what you're trying to see on screen.. Otherwise, the VS4M is a very usable device. It uses a Mediatek dual-core processor (1.3GHz) and has 512MB RAM, so while it won’t be winning any speed tests, there is enough power here to do what most people do with smartphones — calling, messaging, social media, web browsing, etc. It doesn’t love multitasking, so you’ll need to be patient while switching tasks.. Impressively, there is even enough grunt to handle some of the slick new games on the Google Play Store. Candy Crush Soda Saga plays well, without any memorably hiccups in graphics or performance. To push the VS4M even further we installed Riptide GP2, a fast-paced jets racing game. This experience wasn’t 100 percent, with plenty of lag in the frame rate visible, but it still managed to be pretty good fun.. Android also plays a part in delivering this smooth performance, with Google's system becoming less power intensive with each version. The VS4M runs on Android Jelly Bean and comes with all the Google apps you'll need, like Maps, Gmail and, most importantly, the Google Play Store.. It is worth nothing that this is a 3G phone only -- no blisteringly fast 4G speeds here.. One common smartphone task you’ll avoid with the VS4M is taking photos. The 3.2 megapixel camera is about as good as you’d expect on the back of a $70 phone. There’s no focus mechanism, images come out pixelated and the colours are so bad the shots might as well be in black and white.. We tried a number of ways to improve the photos with this phone. We installed different camera apps, tried shooting in HDR (high dynamic range) mode and played around with the exposure levels. Ultimately, it is a lost cause.. When you add it up, it’s difficult not to see good value in the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini, even if it is hard to call it a good smartphone. Vodafone is bundling the phone with a $40 pre paid voucher and three months of Spotify Premium (valued at about $36), so the phone is basically a freebie (albeit one that asks you to recharge your account every month).. There is definitely nothing great about the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini, but just getting a device that can do everything a smartphone can for $69 is a plus in our books. That said, if you can stretch your budget a little further, you might also consider the Huawei Ascend Y550 4G for $99 with Vodafone, or the Boost View 5 for $99 with Boost Mobile.. You you already own a more expensive smartphone, you might consider the VS4M a cost-effective Wi-Fi modem. Like all Androids, the phone can be used an internet hotspot for up to 5 devices, and at this price, there are few cheaper.. Thousands of mobile phone plans unpacked.

A rear-facing 3.2MP camera is all that's on offer with the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini and because there's no flash, it doesn't hold up well in low-light environments. A night mode option is available but in reality it is a poor substitute to a flash.. You won't be taking any professional-grade photos with this handset and there aren't any clever HTC One M8 -style ultrapixels or advanced features here.. Instead, it's a WYSIWYG budget snapper that will suffice for quick shots on the move that can then be posted to Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.. That's not to say there aren't a couple of features to play with. You can change both the ISO and the exposure level, as well as take a Panoramic shot. GPS tagging is also on offer so you can add location tags to your snaps.. There's also the option to shoot video on the Smart 4 Mini at QCIF, VGA, 480p and 720p HD resolutions. You can choose to mute the sound recording as well if you wish.. Take a look below for some examples of shots taken with the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini..

The Smart 4 Mini is a cheap phone with good web browsing performance, but it falls short everywhere else. Processor: Dual-core 1.3GHz Mediatek MT6572, Screen size: 4in, Screen resolution: 480x800, Rear camera: 3.15-megapixel, Storage: 4GB, Wireless data: 3G, Size: 121x64x12mm, Weight: 117g, Operating system: Android 4.2.2. Good, cheap smartphones typically cost at least £100, with the Motorola Moto G being a fantastic example of a budget smartphone done well. The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini, however, costs just £50 on Vodafone's Pay As You Go service, which makes it one of the cheapest smartphones around.. You can see how Vodafone has kept the price down, though, as the Smart 4 Mini's chunky plastic chassis flexes when you press the back panel. It's a far cry from the solid build quality of the Motorola Moto G or the cheaper Motorola Moto E , and the Smart 4 Mini's meagre weight of 117g also makes it feel a little flimsy in the hand. Still, it’s perfectly comfortable to hold. There's a lot of extra bulk round the Smart 4 Mini's tiny 4in screen, which makes it easy to grip.. We were unsurprised to find that the 4in display only has a resolution of 480x800, but text and app icons looked fairly sharp on the phone's home screen. Android 4.2.2 also ran very smoothly, although you'll probably want to get rid of a lot of the preinstalled Vodafone widgets to help free up some space on the phone's five main home screens.. As you'd expect from a budget phone, the Smart 4 Mini's screen quality wasn't great. With a measured peak brightness of just 270.17cd/m2, we found it difficult to see the screen clearly when we were outside in bright sunshine and the screen's mediocre sRGB colour gamut score of 64.6 per cent also meant that colours lacked depth and vibrancy.. The screen looked much better indoors, but even here we had trouble seeing the finer detail in some of our test images due to the Smart 4 Mini's contrast ratio of 781:1. This ratio isn't terrible for a budget phone, but the screen's narrow viewing angles also made it difficult to see clearly unless we were looking at the phone straight on. Setting it down on a table, for instance, produced a noticeable shift in brightness, and text became almost illegible.. Web browsing on the Smart 4 Mini was surprisingly smooth. Its dual core 1.3GHz processor scored a respectable 1,622ms in our SunSpider JavaScript benchmarks using its default browser, which puts it on par with the Motorola Moto E. The phone completed the test more slowly when we used the Dolphin browser, though, taking 1,861ms.. Remarkably, the Smart 4 Mini coped with desktop-based web pages very well for such a cheap phone. Panning round a web page that was still loading proved jerky, but we only noticed a very small amount of delay between us scrolling down the page and the phone responding accordingly. The Moto E is a fraction smoother in everyday use, but we only noticed the difference when comparing them side by side.. The Smart 4 Mini isn't cut out for demanding apps, though, as its graphics performance is abysmal. The only graphics test it passed was the 3DMark Ice Storm test, where it scored a mere 1,833, which roughly translates to an average frame rate of 8fps. It failed to run both the Ice Storm Extreme and Ice Storm Unlimited tests, and Epic Citadel crashed every time we tried to load it. You'll still be able to play basic 2D games, though, such as Angry Birds and Jetpack Joyride, but anything more demanding and that requires 3D graphics may prove troublesome.. We weren't impressed with the Smart 4 Mini's battery life either. Its 1,400mAh battery lasted just 7 hours in our continuous video playback test with the screen set to half brightness, which is only a 10 minute improvement on last year's Vodafone Smart 3 handset. The Moto E, on the other hand, lasted almost 10 hours under the same conditions.. The Smart 4 Mini’s 3.15-megapixel camera also disappointed us. We expect budget phones to have at least a 5-megapixel sensor on its main camera, so the Smart 4 Mini was always going to perform poorly by comparison. Unsurprisingly, images were severely lacking in detail, and it struggled to expose the sky correctly. Admittedly, shots were a lot brighter than the images we took on the Moto E at the same time, but noise was present throughout large areas of the same colour on the Smart 4 Mini, and colours in general looked very drab and cool. You certainly wouldn't want to use it as your main camera, and it's really only good enough for quick snaps that you want to keep and view on your phone.. The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini is certainly very cheap, but its good web browsing performance is one of its few redeeming features. Its screen, camera and battery life are all beaten by the superior Motorola Moto E , and you're also locked in to Vodafone's Pay As You Go service. If your budget really doesn't stretch to £90, the Smart 4 Mini is a decent phone for its price, but spend and you'll have one of the best budget Android phones money can buy..

Latest Stories My feed Categories Contact. Hot devices Review: Vodafone Smart 4 mini 6th May 14. By Brendan Cooper 0 Followers Follow. 4-inch WVGA TFT, 400 x 800 pixels. The first thing you notice when unboxing the. is that it’s, well, not that mini. dimensions of 12cm by 6.4cm, Vodafone’s entry-level smartphone is comparable to the size of many high-end devices. The iPhone 5C for example, is just 4mm taller and a couple of millimetres thinner.. Running on Android 4.2.2, with a 1.3Ghz dual core chip, and sporting a not-too-shabby 3.2 megapixel camera with video functionality, the Smart 4 comes with all the standard bits ’n pieces you’d expect: a USB cable and charger, slot for a 32GB MicroSD and black headphones that do their job just fine. You’re looking at around 11 hours of talk-time when on 3G from the 1400mAh battery.. Connectivity-wise you have Wi-Fi direct, tethering GPS and a nifty wireless FM radio for those must-check-on-the-cricket-score moments.. So far so good then, but it’s when you start unlocking the power of Google that things heat up. With more than one million Android apps downloadable from the Google Play Store as well as eBooks, music and movies, all your entertainment is collated in one place. Your social media needs have also been catered for with Facebook, Twitter and YouTube preloaded – all you need to do is sign into your accounts – and web-surfing is enabled by Chrome, our favourite browser.. Also preloaded are Vodacom apps like My Vodacom, Vlive, as well as 3D maps – all of which are easily accessible direct from your lockscreen.. We particularly liked the gesture typing that reacts smoothly to your finger and vibrates to let you know you’ve typed a letter, which is useful in noisy environments. Other cool features are the ability to mute the phone by simply turning it over, the speed with which the screen rotates and the swipe down on the home screen to access your notifications – again comparable to the experience on much more expensive phones.. The overall impression is that as a low-end, relatively inexpensive smartphone, the. good job and at its low price point (from. R79 per month on uChoose Flexi 50 ), should be attractive not only to new. smartphone users, but for those who want smart functionality but aren’t bothered with needing to own the coolest-looking, newest, big-name brand devices.. If you simply need a phone to make calls to your mom, browse the web, stay in touch via social media, snap the odd pic of your cat and enjoy the power of the Google Play platform, there may be many consumers who ask, why spend more when you can go mini 4?.

Have had the smart4turbo (&tab) and always rooted them. This was similar, easy with Kingo apk, all bloatware & languages & stuff off. Handy little mini phone, good for work / check weather etc.. phonesmasher, 20 Jan 2017 ive got spare parts for a Vodafone 785 screen circuit board and slightly used battery I want LCD display. MAJORIE23, 19 Jan 2017 where do i get a vodafone vf685 battery mine just died ive got a spare battery if still needed :). ive got spare parts for a Vodafone 785 screen circuit board and slightly used battery. where do i get a vodafone vf685 battery mine just died. the vodafone smart mini 4 mobile phone is a-ZTE v785-. So what is the manufacturer of the phone? All I know is, it's Alcatel but I'm not sure.. Hanif, 26 Oct 2016 Not bad but I can't update it... I had the same problem ,until I did a hard reset, now it is updated and even better!. Not bad but I can't update it.... I've been using this iphone for 2 years now so here are some things i'd like to write:. For daily use as a iphone it's just fine : nice quality calls, good use of messaging apps like viber, messenger , whatsapp. On the downside it's the camera which is the worst simply, design is really bad and it's really thick.After 2 years the battery with 2-3 hours of wifi, browsing and youtube doesn't last more than one day. So it's basically a good phone for some kid or adults that dont have many expectations and their main purpose is calls and communication via messaging but without photos.. Akash, 25 Aug 2016 my phone says that it's sim slot is permanently locked. if there any solution for it with Vodafone it your phones over 9 months old you can use their free unlock service if it's not then it will cost around $30 to unlock it. The Viper, 09 Aug 2016 Bought the phone 4 days ago and I still don't find MY CONTACTS anywhere on the phone.. more Hi, I bought one of these 2 years ago, did not use it for most of the time but have downloaded the manual from internet which is fine - contacts are under the People icon - not sure whether this is your problem or not sorry if I have got the wrong end of the stick about your problem - from a thick person!. this phone is the worst I ever had, I cannot begin to list the defects but the biggest pain is the touch sensitive keyboard, I HATE THIS PIECE OF CRAP. my phone says that it's sim slot is permanently locked. if there any solution for it. Bought the phone 4 days ago and I still don't find MY CONTACTS anywhere on the phone. So I cannot add contacts I had to use an old phone and save my contacts on it to see them on this phone and I can not delete any contacts. Just got this phone as a replacement while my other phone is in repair, and I must say this is the worst phone I have ever used. All you can see is glare in sunlight, camera quality is worse than my Nokia N73 and doesn't even have autofocus or flash and the battery runs dry so quickly just from making calls.. My phone since yesterday not working totally, I could not open it has been collapsed. Paul /UK, 20 Feb 2016 I find the Phone is very good It was at a good price and it do's every thing I want. dm, 05 Jun 2015 my vodacom s4 mini shut down.it wont switch on but if u connect the charger the charging light... more Same happens to me !!!.

Home Rss Site Map About Us. ← Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini Acer Liquid E3 → Tags. Oct 08, 2014 Vodafone Smart 4 Mini. What is the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini? The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini is a small, very low cost phone. If you want a mobile you won’t have to worry too much about breaking, need to buy someone their first real smartphone or just want a backup, it seems like a good option. At £50, it is just a tenth the price of the top phones. There are obvious cuts made in almost every area of the Smart 4 Mini that mean we can’t fully recommend it, but you do get the full. Android experience for very little cash here. Vodafone Smart 4 Mini - Design The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini is typical of a lower-cost Android phone. It’s plastic and slightly chunky but ultimately a fairly small. _phone_ compared to the giant devices you’ll see on sale for several times the price on the high street. However, it’s far from the worst-looking mobile. Front-on it’s nice and simple, while its touch keys have none of that over-designed look they have on some lower-cost phones. The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini’s plastic back has a hint of stylisation and a neat bronze-ish black finish. There's also a white version available. It couldn’t pass for a £250 phone, but a £100 one? Sure. Its ergonomics aren’t too bad either. At 12.3mm it’s pretty thick, but as the Smart 4 Mini has a 4-inch screen phone it really doesn’t matter. Unless you have tiny hands you’ll have no trouble using the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini, and the phone’s back has a nice smooth curve to it that makes it comfortable to hold. The back pops off, and under the easily-removable battery you’ll find the microSD card slot and the full-size SIM slot. Where other phones have largely moved on to the microSIM standard, the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini still uses the older, larger kind – it tells you everything you need to know about how cutting-edge this phone is. For £50, though, we’re pretty happy with its build. For those who want to know a bit more, the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini is actually produced by Alcatel, and then re-branded with the Vodafone name. You’ll find that almost all network-branded phones like this are made by Alcatel, Huawei or ZTE. Vodafone Smart 4 Mini - Screen The screen is one of the most important elements of any phone. The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini’s display is a mixed bag, but given the price we’re actually quite impressed with some elements of it. Sharpness isn’t too bad, given we’re talking about a £50 device. It uses a 480 x 800 pixel display, and across the four inches of screen that provides you 233ppi. That’s actually a fair bit higher than some significantly more expensive phones, including the Nokia Lumia 630. We’ve seen entry-level displays like this look very soft, but there’s a decent amount of definition to the Smart 4 Mini’s screen. Contrast indoors is pretty good too, leading to images with the sort of ‘pop’ we don’t expect to see in a phone this cheap. And although reds are slightly anaemic-looking, the rest of the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini’s colour palette is reasonably good. Our first impression was one of pleasant surprise. However, the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini is subject to just about every other image quality limitation you normally get at the price. First, viewing angles are quite rubbish, because this phone uses a TN-type panel rather than the more popular IPS kind. More annoying, the phone has no effective anti-reflective coating. In bright sunlight, using the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini does become a bit of a struggle. There is, thankfully, an auto brightness setting that’ll automatically ramp-up the backlight intensity to compensate when you venture outside, though. Max brightness can just about cope with the outdoors, meaning you won’t need to squint with migraine-inducing intensity. But it’s still far from a joy to use. Another issue is what the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini’s screen is made of. Where more expensive phones tend to have a top layer made of glass, this one’s all-plastic. As well as feeling a little less nice than glass –. its brand of friction is a little different – it’s far more scratch-prone. Our review unit had clearly been taken for a test drive before we got our hands on it, possibly literally along the surface of a road by the looks of things. Keep the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini in a pocket full of change and keys, and you’ll earn a few battle scars before long. Plastic is also far more flexible than glass, and as a result it’s very easy to bend the screen’s top layer with your finger, causing unnerving distortion in the display itself. You don’t need to press too hard at all. These sorts of compromises are the kind of things you need to accept in a £50 phone as you’ll need to spend at least £70-80 to get a real quality upgrade. Ready to pay the extra? Look to something like the Motorola Moto E, a phone with a glass-topped IPS screen. Vodafone Smart 4 Mini: Software, Apps and Performance One of the best elements of the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini is that it uses a near-standard version of Android. It may be the slightly-aged Android 4.2.2, but having the clean and clear default interface is a big plus point. Many lower-cost phones end up with slightly wonky custom interfaces that are more difficult to use, and significantly slower. The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini may have the simplicity part down, but speed is still a real issue. The phone is very laggy by current standards, requiring a fair bit of patience if you’re used to a higher-end phone. We found that you often have to wait as the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini plays catch-up, whether you’re typing on the keyboard or just trying to flick around the interface. The phone doesn’t help itself either, as there’s even a bit of (unnecessary, we assume) delay in the vibrating haptic feedback that kicks-in when you press a key. Fingers crossed this lag will be improved in future updates (don’t hold your breath), but it’s unlikely to disappear. The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini has a pretty low-end CPU/GPU/RAM combo – the team that determines how powerful any computer is, more-or-less. The phone has a dual-core Mediatek MT6572 chipset, which uses a dual-core 1.3GHz CPU. In theory it shouldn’t be much worse than the pretty snappy Snapdragon 200 CPU of the Motorola Moto E. Benchmarks seem to suggest this too –. the phone comes out with 572 points in the Geekbench 3 benchmark, which is close to the result you get from the Moto E. But combine the entry-level CPU with the lowly 512MB RAM plus whatever poking around Alcatel has done in the Android software and you end up with a phone that can be quite frustrating to use. It even struggled playing our standard 720p MP4 test video, which was a surprise. It's not much use for flashy games, either, but more because of its limited storage than the processor. There's simply not enough room to install the 3D games we use for performance testing, and you can't just use the microSD slot for these installs in most cases. For casual games, though? The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini will be perfectly fine for those. Vodafone Smart 4 Mini - Camera The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini has a very basic camera in just about every respect. It’s low-res with a 3-megapixel sensor, there’s no flash and no front camera. There’s also no autofocus, limiting the sorts of photos you can take. It keeps its camera app simple as well. There are hardly any buttons on show, and even when you dive further into the menu system, you won’t find a great deal on offer. There are panorama and night modes, and some ISO/exposure controls, but no fun filters and no HDR mode. Outdoors screen visibility is another issue when shooting photos As easy to use as it may be in one sense, it’s also limited and pretty slow. Expect very little and you won’t be disappointed. The actual photos the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini takes are fairly poor, with little detail compared to a more expensive phone. But we still think they’ll do the job for the odd photo to put on Facebook or Twitter. We have certainly seen worse 3-megapixel phone cameras. Detail at the edge of the frame is rubbish and it's a bit dull-looking, but exposure metering could be a lot worse, given the cloudy scene. This gives you an example of the detail and grain to expect. For a 3-megapixel camera, detail at the centre of the frame is decent. Surprisingly enough, video actually fares a bit better. You can shoot videos at up to 720p resolution, detailed enough to be worth uploading for your friends to watch. Don’t expect too much, though –. while better than the VGA quality you often get at this price, footage is still quite noisy-looking. Vodafone Smart 4 Mini - Battery We can live with a poor camera, but will the phone last through a day? In our experience, just. The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini has a 1400mAh battery, a fair bit smaller than the units used in most rivals. While the phone seems to use some smart measures to ensure not too much charge is used when the phone’s in standby, battery level free-falls as soon as you start using the phone. When left playing a video, the battery lasts for just four and a half hours. For some wider context, the £90 Moto G manages eight hours and the £70 Alcatel One Touch Pop S3 around five hours. It's among the worst-performing smartphones in terms of video stamina. Vodafone Smart 4 Mini - Sound Quality The phone’s speaker is similarly basic. You get a single speaker on the back, whose grille sits right next to the camera lens. It’s not hugely loud and is bass-free, but it is at least able to go to top volume without becoming a crackly, distorted mess. And it certainly has the power to wake you up reliably using the inbuilt alarm. In a similar vein, call quality is perfectly fine – nothing to get either excited or upset about. There’s the usual secondary microphone on the back of the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini for active noise cancellation, but this just shows you get it in just about any phone these days. Should I buy the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini? The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini is a phone we could recommend much more happily if it wasn’t for one thing – those annoying performance issues. They suck some of the fun out of this phone, and mean it needs a bit more patience than we’d like. There are other issues too, like how little storage there is and quite how scratched your Vodafone Smart 4 Mini screen will probably get after a few months’ use. At the price, though, you’re going to end up with a better phone than you’d get from a company like Samsung. We’d rather have a Vodafone Smart 4 Mini than a Samsung Galaxy Young or Galaxy Fame. However, it is proof that you can’t yet get a great new Android phone for £50. Just make sure you know about the compromises involved before buying. Verdict The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini is a very affordable phone that’s among the very best you can buy at the price. However, its quite slow and cuts across the board mean you need more patience than you’d need with a slightly more expensive mobile.

Obviously, the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini is bolted to Vodafone -. so if you're in a poor gathering area for the red system you might want to give. This isn't Vodafone's first Smart handset and regarding. design, it's almost identical to last year's Vodafone Smart Mini.. The square shaped black chassis means it's far from the most. attractive budget portable out there and with measurements of 122 x 64 x 12mm. it can't claim to be thin either.. However, the handset is light at 111g. is mediocre - there's a touch of flex on the chassis when you push down on it -. but it appears to be sufficiently powerful to survive drops and knocks without. There are two physical buttons on the phone. the power switch located on the top of the handset by the 3.5mm headphone jack,. and the second is the volume rocker on the right hand side.. The Back, Home and Settings buttons are delicate touch keys. at the bottom of the 800 x 480, 4-inch WVGA screen which is, unfortunately,. encompassed by a stout black bezel that does nothing for the stylish of the.

It's without a doubt a cheap plastic development, but to. give the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini its due, it sits comfortably in the palm and the. 4-inch screen means you can operate it comfortably with only one hand.. As you'd expect for £50, the internal specifications are. about as moving as the design. You're just given 4GB of internal storage to. play with although Vodafone has incorporated a microSD card opening underneath. the 1400mAh battery for boosting storage.. A 1.3GHz dual-core processor is in the engine, backed with. This doesn't make for rankling performance and there's no choice. The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini uses Google's older Android 4.2. Jelly Bean operating framework and anyone with a touch of familiarity with. smartphones will have no inconvenience navigating around the handset.. You're given five homescreens to load with apps and gadgets. which, because of the 4-inch screen estimate, will top off rapidly.. The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini uses the standard Android keyboard. but the screen measure means it's particularly compact.. As specified earlier, performance is intelligent of the. 1.3GHz processor and 512MB of RAM so when you swipe between the homescreens or. enter the app drawer, it's not as liquid and fast as more costly Android phones. like the Sony Xperia Z2 or the Huawei Ascend P7.. Loading a web webpage over the 3G association took two or. three seconds and rotating the screen from portrait to landscape also lags. somewhat longer than on more intense handsets.. Google's Android OS hasn't been given any extra tweaks or. skins although the usual Google Apps – Youtube, Drive, Google+ and so forth,. Vodafone has preinstalled Twitter and Facebook but has generally. The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini posted a GeekBench 3 score of 581,. which is about standard for a dual-core processor at this level. comparison, the as of late released Blade Q Mini, which costs £60, posted a. GeekBench 3 score of just 468.. The main usages at a phone at this cost point are casual. perusing, presenting on social systems administration locales and the standard. And, thankfully, none of these are excessively. precarious or excessively demanding for the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini.. Tucked inside the Vodafone Smart 4 Mini is a 1400mAh. Li-particle battery that actually presents a really reasonable performance.. Due for the most part to the lack of top of the line. features and the lack of a HD screen, I found that 48 hours with the Vodafone. Smart 4 Mini on a solitary charge was within reach given moderate usage.. Charging is handled via the microUSB space on the bottom of. the handset and a small, white, notification light appears at the top of the. screen to disclose to you that the device is charging.. Dissimilar to the similarly-budget Sony Xperia M or the top. of the line Galaxy S5, there's no alternative to enter a. In this way, if you want. to monitor squeeze, the best alternative is to shut down the brightness and. You can discover Android's breakdown of your battery usage. However, because of the small, non-HD screen, it's. far-fetched you'll be utilizing the Smart 4 Mini for battery draining tasks. like watching video or playing graphically demanding games..

Over the space of a hour and. a half, the test drained a 100% battery to 63% which isn't particularly great..

A rear-facing 3.2MP camera is all that's on offer with the. Vodafone Smart 4 Mini and because there's no flash, it doesn't hold up well in. A night mode choice is available but in reality it is a.

Everything spins around the low price tag and I believe it's great to. see that smartphones have become so affordable.. The Vodafone Smart 4 Mini is far from the best Android. The £50 price tag should disclose to all of you have to. It offers sufficiently only as far as performance and. features to make it an advantageous venture as a moment handset or a crisis. The real difficulty lies in the fact that, if you're on a budget,. there's any number of similar handsets, similar to the Moto E, ZTE Blade Q Mini. or Samsung Galaxy Fame to look over.
