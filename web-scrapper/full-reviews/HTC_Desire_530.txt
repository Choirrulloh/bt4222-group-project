While the company’s flagship HTC One A9 smartphone looked great, it was overpriced and offered middle-of-the-road hardware. Then the company disappointed everyone by not unveiling the HTC One M10 at MWC.. So you could be forgiven for missing the arrival of the Desire 530. It’s a phone that, on paper at least, has the potential to be one of 2016 best affordable smartphones – although its UK price hasn’t yet been confirmed.. Its standout design feature is its ‘Micro Splash’ finish, which is created using nozzles that spray paint at various pressures and different thicknesses at the back of the phone. As a result, HTC claims each Desire 530 is unique.. Video: TrustedReviews explains how to pick your next smartphone. As budget phones go, the Desire 530 genuinely feels like it’s been designed with care. The phone looks like a stripped-down version of HTC’s selfie specialist, the Desire Eye , which is no bad thing.. During my initial hands-on with the Desire 530 at the MWC show, I was a big fan of the Micro Splash finish, as it made the white model I tested look like a Jackson Pollock painting. Curiously, the model HTC sent me for review was the one edition that doesn’t get the Micro Splash treatment, instead being a fairly dull grey. It still feels good to hold, but it doesn’t have that visual ‘wow’ factor that the splashed models create.. The inclusion of a lanyard slot is another unique design feature. For those who missed the boat, lanyards were a fashion accessory that could be seen on many ’90s school kids’ Nokia 3230s. They’re basically bits of shoelace that let you connect the phone to your wrist – making it harder to lose.. HTC claims the lanyards will prove a hit with younger buyers looking to accessorise their phone, and while this might be a stretched claim, I can see the feature being useful for people who use their phone to capture photos in crowds at festivals or sports events, where the chance of an accidental drop is high.. HTC is also offering a range of ‘snap cases’ for people who want to further customise their phone. The snap cases have the same Micro Splash finish as the Desire 530, but offer a more varied number of colour options. If you’re unfortunate enough to end up with the plain grey version, this could be a great substitution. Related: Best affordable smartphones 2016. Interesting design features aside, the Desire 530 is fairly well built – by budget handset standards, at least. The plastic undeniably looks a little drab without its speckled finish, but it’s more than solid enough to survive the odd accidental drop. The grey unit I tested came out of an encounter with my flat’s stairwell without so much as a scratch.. With a 5-inch screen, it also hits the same size sweet spot as the Nexus 5X , which makes it one of the few small-hand-friendly smartphones on the market. Overall, it’s a lovely device to hold, if not to use.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

The inclusion of a microSD slot is a key positive, as it’ll let you add up to 200GB of extra space to the Desire 530’s 16GB of built-in storage.. Thanks to the inclusion of Android Marshmallow ’ s Adoptable Storage feature, if you’re using an SD card that’s fast enough, you’ll be able to seamlessly expand your storage. The phone automatically assigns where apps and files are stored without any management required on your part. Buy Now: HTC Desire 530 at Amazon.com from $179. The Desire 530’s 5.0-inch Super LCD screen is a little less impressive, but reasonable for the money. The specs match the Desire 530’s arch-rival, the Moto G , which is the same size and has an identical 1,280×720-pixel resolution.. The Desire 530’s screen is more than sharp enough for regular use. Colours are a little drab for my liking, but there’s also a useful temperature control in the phone’s settings that lets you tweak the screen to meet your preference.. The temperature control is a nice touch, but I found a few serious issues that hamper the screen’s overall appeal. For starters, viewing angles aren’t great. Viewed from even slightly off-centre, whites quickly distort and take on various hues including blue, grey and yellow, depending on the angle you view them from.. The phone’s maximum brightness is lower than I’d like. Even maxed out the phone looks dull and becomes unusable when hit with even moderately bright light. During my time with the Desire 530, even on grey overcast days in London the phone’s screen regularly became unreadable outdoors.. Being fair to HTC these are issues I experience on most affordable smartphones and even 12 months ago I’d have found them forgivable. But with the arrival of handsets such as the Moto G, EE Harrier and Honor 5X , this is no longer the case.. By today’s standards the Desire 530’s screen isn’t good enough, even at the budget end of the market.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

The HTC Desire 530 is an affordable MetroPCS phone with a decent camera, but it's held back by slow performance and a dim screen..

PCMag reviews products independently , but we may earn affiliate commissions from buying links on this page.. View All 7 Photos in Gallery. Dual SIM card slots and expandable storage.. The HTC Desire 530 is an affordable MetroPCS phone with a decent camera, but it's held back by slow performance and a dim screen.. If you want an affordable phone on MetroPCS, your choice pretty much comes down to a budget phablet or a compact entry-level phone. The 5-inch, $159 HTC Desire 530 is the latter. With 720p display, and 8-megapixel camera it seems like a good option on paper, but it has a dim screen with serious touch latency issues. The Samsung Galaxy On5 has performance for a lower price, making it a better option for most users.. The Desire 530's design is unique. It's shaped like your standard white plastic slab, but its back and sides are covered in colorful speckled dots, though they aren't very noticeable from a distance. On the right the volume rocker is a sober black, while the ridged power button below it is bright orange. The camera lens on the back protrudes slightly and is surrounded by a circle of black plastic, as is the LED flash below. On the bottom right corner of the back there's a circular indentation with an attachment point for a wrist strap.. View All 7 Photos in Gallery. Both the top and bottom lip are charcoal gray, and the screen is surrounded by a bezel with HTC branding on the bottom. There's an off-center micro USB charging port on the bottom and a 3.5mm audio jack on the top. The left side has a flap that opens to grant access to dual SIM card slots (a rare feature for a US phone) and a microSD card slot which worked fine in testing with our 256GB card.. At 5.8 by 2.8 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and a weight of 5.6 ounces, the Desire 530 is a standard size, similar to the On5 (5.6 by 2.8 by 0.3 inches, 5.3 ounces) but heavier than the LG K7 (5.7 by 2.9 by 0.4 inches, 4.9 ounces). Regardless, single-handed use is simple and the sturdy plastic body is comfortable to grip.. You get a 5-inch, 1,280-by-720 display, which, despite matching the 720p resolution and sharpness of the On5 and surpassing the K7's 480p panel (196ppi), is dim and has mediocre viewing angles. The screen washes out when viewed from the sides and even at maximum brightness it's difficult to use in direct sunlight.. A MetroPCS phone, the HTC Desire 530 uses the same cell towers as T-Mobile. It supports LTE bands 2/4/5/7/12/13, which meant strong network performance in midtown Manhattan in our tests, with a top download speed of 14Mbps. The phone supports Wi-Fi on the 2.4GHz band and has Bluetooth 4.1.. There's a raspy, robotic edge to voices, but transmissions are clear and noise cancellation manages to dampen most background noise aside from. Earpiece volume could be a bit louder, but the speakerphone is loud.. HTC BoomSound is enabled when listening through wired headphones, but in testing, we couldn't detect a significant bump in audio quality.. The Desire 530 is powered by an entry-level Snapdragon 210 processor clocked at 1.1GHz. In AnTuTu benchmarks, which measure overall system performance, the phone scored 23,631, putting it a tier beneath the Exynos 3475-powered On5 (25,753), and several paces behind the Snapdragon 617-powered ZTE Zmax Pro (47,007).. In terms of general performance, it also falls short. There's significant touch-screen latency with presses sometimes taking several seconds to register. Apps are slow to launch, and because the phone only has 1.5GB of RAM, multitasking abilities are limited. In testing, the phone couldn't handle Asphalt 8 Airborne or GTA San Andreas. Stick to less demanding titles like Temple Run.. See How We Test Cell Phones. In our rundown test, the phone lasted for 4 hours, 16 minutes when streaming full-screen video over LTE at maximum brightness. That's a shorter runtime than both the Galaxy On5 (5 hours, 52 minutes) and LG K7 (5 hours, 57 minutes). The battery should still last you most of the day, but the cell isn't removable, which is a disadvantage compared with the On5 and K7.. The 8-megapixel rear camera takes fairly clear shots during the day and in well-lit settings. I found shots to have warmer color reproduction compared with the stark whites of the On5, giving most pictures a more wholesome look. However, the camera fared poorly in low-light settings, often either taking several seconds to focus or blurring out shots. In tests, the camera app was slow and unresponsive, requiring several seconds between shots and to switch camera modes. The phone can record decent video in 720p at 30fps, but footage tends to be muddy and jittery in lower light. The 5-megapixel front facing camera is fine for selfies and video but produces grainy results in low light.. The HTC Desire 530 runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with HTC's Sense UI skin running on top. Most design and visual elements resemble stock Android. The main addition is Blinkfeed, a custom home screen panel accessed when swiping to the left. It brings up highlights, news, weather, updates, suggested apps, and other information relevant to users. It can be disabled if you'd rather use that space for apps.. In terms of bloatware, you have the standard MetroPCS apps, and HTC adds AndroidNEmoji, EmojiOne for Go Keyboard, Facebook, Instagram, Kika Keyboard, Messenger, News Republic, Photo Editor, , Themes, and Zoe Video Editor. The emoji keyboards and can be uninstalled, but the rest like Facebook and Instagram can only be disabled.. Of a total of 16GB internal storage you're left with roughly half, 8.62GB. It's a hefty chunk of space eaten by pre-installed apps, but you can always use a microSD card and format it for internal storage using Marshmallow's Adoptable Storage feature.. The HTC Desire 530 is an affordable and relatively compact entry-level phone on MetroPCS, but its slow performance and dim display the Galaxy On5 a stronger option for most users. For $19 less, the On5 gives you a brighter screen, smoother overall performance, and better battery life, though at the cost of reduced internal storage and a weaker camera. However, if you're willing to go up in size, the ZTE Zmax Pro is our Editors' Choice winner among phablets with a snappy processor, a crisp 1080p display, and sharp dual lens camera sensors. At $179 it's the best combination of price and performance for most MetroPCS customers.. Bottom Line: The HTC Desire 530 is an affordable MetroPCS phone with a decent camera, but it's held back by slow performance and a dim screen..

CNET también está disponible en español.. HTC's slick, budget-friendly Desire 530 is heading stateside. The 5-inch smartphone will be available with T-Mobile and Verizon, and will cost $179 unlocked.. by July 7, 2016 6:00 AM PDT. 5-inch, 1,280x720-pixel resolution display Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 1.5GB of RAM 2,200 mAh battery 16GB of internal storage, up to 256GB of expandable storage. HTC first showed off its Desire 530 back in February at Mobile World Congress. Now, the 5-inch smartphone is coming to the US.. Like most of the company's phones, the Desire 530 looks slick. It sports a trim 8.3mm profile and has a thin bezel on either side of its screen. On the back you'll find what HTC calls a "multi splash" design -- it looks like spots of paint on a blank canvas (which is much nicer than it sounds).. Available on T-Mobile and Verizon, the Desire is a phone for the budget conscious, with an unlocked version coming to HTC's website "later this month" for $179.. For that price, you'll get the following specs:. HTC's new Desire phones keep a low, thin profile (pictures). On the back you'll find an 8-megapixel camera, while the snapper on the front weighs in at 5 megapixels. That front camera comes with "Auto Selfie" and "Voice Selfie" features, which let you take selfies without pressing a button..

[ Further reading: The best Android phones for every budget. ] Setting proper expectations Jason Cipriani. Crank the brightness to 10 and leave it there Jason Cipriani. Just who should buy this phone? Jason Cipriani. HTC’s Desire 530 is just about as inexpensive as a smartphone in the U.S. T-Mobile is selling it for $159 at full price, with HTC selling an unlocked version compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile for $20 more.. It’s a good looking phone, carrying over the same basic design found in previous Desire devices. Only now, the 530 features a white shell that appears to have been “splashed” with specs of orange and grey paint.. If you’re the kind to look over specifications before making a purchase, you’re likely to come away unimpressed—the same conclusion I’ve come to after testing the T-Mobile variant of the phone for the past week.. Speaker grills are found just above and blow the Desire 530’s display.. It’s almost more difficult to point out weaknesses and gripe about a sub-$200 phone than a flagship caliber device due to the constantly present qualifier of “but it only costs $160.”. Even still, expectations going into reviewing a phone like the Desire 530 are relatively low. It’s a budget friendly device that’s not going to blow you away, yet it should provide enough performance for the casual user. And it does succeed in that regard… barely.. Equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 processor, 1.5GB of memory, and 16GB of internal storage, the Desire 530 is slow. There’s no other way to say it.. Its sluggish performance is noticeable from the start. The rather mundane task of setting up a device for the first time took longer than usual, with app installation being the main sticking point. I watched as some app updates, such as Gmail, took upwards of 5 minutes to install. And that’s after it was downloaded.. No matter the task, there’s a delay between tapping on the screen or navigation button and the action being completed on screen. Be it opening Chrome, waiting for the keyboard to show up after tapping on a text field, or opening the Settings app. Everything takes just a bit longer than it should.. I hate to harp on using Pokemon Go as a test parameter, but let me just say the Desire 530 couldn’t run AR mode. Almost immediately after pulling up the AR interface, an alert asked me to turn AR mode off to continue playing. Leaving AR mode enabled, despite the prompt, showed a Pokeball and a shadow off in the distance. I couldn’t find the Pokemon on the screen, no matter where I turned or looked with the phone.. Further adding to the 530’s performance woes is terrible battery life: it squeezed out just under four hours in the Geekbench battery run-down test. The 530 carries a 2,200 mAh battery (fairly small by today’s standards), but the Moto G4 line is within the same price range and offers a 3,000 mAh battery with results closer to seven hours in the same test.. In other words, be prepared to charge the 530 just after lunch in order to get through an entire day.. The HTC Desire 530 in white with hints of orange and grey.. HTC equipped the Desire 530 with a a 5-inch 1280x720 HD display. At first glance it seems to provide decent performance, but after using it for a week, I grew frustrated with how dull the display is. For the most part, I left auto-brightness off and left its set to full brightness at all times. Even then, the screen was sometimes too dim. Naturally, leaving a device at full brightness is also going to have an impact on battery life, but it’s one of the tradeoffs you are forced to make with the Desire 530.. A photo taken in a low-light environment by the Desire 530 isn’t all that impressive.. The Desire 530 features an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera, and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. I struggled to get consistent performance from either camera, with some shots captured worthy of sharing and saving, while others (like the selfie below) are better off deleted and forgotten about.. A selfie snapped with HTC Desire 530’s front-facing camera, in all its grainy glory.. HTC’s large camera lens on the rear of the Desire 530.. I could see buying it as a teenagers first phone; one they can use to prove just how responsible they are (or aren’t) and then move up from there. Or for someone who wants a phone first, with the smarts second.. Even at that, there are better phones for just a little more money than the 530. Case in point: the Moto G4 ( $199 at Amazon ). You get a much better phone for $30 more, and it comes unlocked, ready to work on any wireless network (as opposed to just AT&T and T-Mobile for the unlocked Desire 530).. The only reason I can see someone buying this phone instead of the Moto G4 or G4 Plus boils down to personal style. Comparatively, the Desire 530 offers a bit of flair and style while the G4 line looks rather boring. Granted, you can purchase decorative backs from Motorola to add a bit of color to the phone, but the 530 looks good out of the box.. Outside of that, the Moto G4 and G4 Plus are worth the extra cost. The Desire 530 just doesn’t deliver on performance, whether it’s something as basic as waiting for an email to load or more taxing tasks such as quickly switching between multiple apps. You’re going to find yourself waiting for apps to load, pages to fill in, and eventually it’s going to get annoying.. It’s not an unusable device, but it’s not a pleasurable device to use either, and there are far better options.. Sluggish performance and screen that fails to impress aren’t worth the low price tag..

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. A cheap phone which fails to cash in. The HTC Desire 530 is a sluggish, entry-level Android phone that simply cuts too many corners to be worth considering.. Design Key features HTC Sense and Android Marshmallow. The HTC Desire 530 is cheap at just £129 and it seems to be aimed at the youth of today. But expectations of what a budget phone can do are rapidly evolving, and it'll take more than a splash of paint and a lanyard slot to get down with the kids.. The 5-inch, 720p screen, 8MP camera and 2,200mAh battery are perfectly respectable specs for an entry-level device, but anyone seeking decent performance is not going to get it here, because the Desire 530 is hamstrung by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 processor and just 1.5GB of RAM.. With the excellent new Moto G4 (£169) hitting the market to join the surprisingly decent Wileyfox Swift (£129) and the cheaper Moto E (£100), not to mention a wave of Chinese newcomers, the HTC Desire 530 really has its work cut out if it expects to attract an audience.. The HTC Desire 530 is actually a really nice size, and it feels very comfortable to hold. The body is a single piece of moulded plastic that curves round to meet the 5-inch display at the front.. The bezels round the display are quite big, and there's an HTC logo at the bottom. You'll also find speaker grilles top and bottom, and the front-facing camera lens at the top-left. It looks pretty good from the front.. As you might expect, there's a micro USB port on the bottom edge, and a standard 3.5mm audio jack up top.. The left spine is home to a fiddly flap that opens to reveal your SIM and microSD card slots, but switching to the right things start to get funky – or ugly, depending on your tastes. The volume rocker is at the top, and then there's the textured, bright orange power button, which stands out like a sore thumb.. On the back you have the option of going for HTC's Micro Splash finish. Apparently each design is unique, but they all look like a child has flicked coloured paint at the phone. There's white with coloured speckles, or black with coloured speckles.. My review unit obviously refused to join the paint party, however, because it's a uniform dull, dark grey. You can also get the Desire 530 in plain white.. On the back there's a camera lens at the top-left corner which juts out, ensuring that it's the first thing that comes into contact with any surface; it's also great at collecting dust and pocket lint. The flash is just below it, while at the bottom-left there's a strange puncture mark that turns out to be a lanyard slot.. If you like to wear your phone around your neck, or maybe tie it to your wrist, so that it doesn't go missing, HTC has you covered.. Budget phones tend to be a little chubby, but the HTC Desire 530 isn't too bad at 8.3mm thick. It weighs in at 140g, and it's just the right size for easy one-handed operation.. At first glance the 5-inch super LCD display, which has a 1280 x 720 pixel resolution, seems reasonable. But then you turn the phone on.. Many high-end phone displays have gone beyond 1080p now, but it's not the 294ppi (pixels per inch) resolution that's the problem with the Desire 530 – on a phone this size it actually looks reasonably sharp.. The real problem is that it's incredibly dull, even when you crank the brightness up to full. It also has terrible viewing angles, which darken even further with the slightest tilt. If you want to be able to see the screen outdoors you're going to have to angle it precisely and max-out the brightness; and even then, frankly, it still looks terrible.. This is also an issue for the Moto E , but spend a little more on something like the Moto G4 and you can get a display that won't drive you mad.. The main reason to consider the HTC Desire 530 is definitely its price. At £120 it's a budget contender from a well-known and well-respected brand, and on paper most of the specs look quite good for the money; however, there are lots of hidden disappointments.. And there's one glaring problem, in the shape of the bargain basement Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 processor and stingy 1.5GB of RAM, as a result of which the HTC Desire 530 is slow – very slow. We'll get into just how slow it is in the next section.. For this phone to win on price it has to compare favourably to the competition, and it just doesn't. You can get a better display or more processing power without spending any more money, and that's a serious problem.. The one thing the Desire 530 arguably has going for it is the design. They're not to my taste, but some people might find the Micro Splash finish and the lanyard slot appealing or useful.. The HTC Desire 530 is certainly a better-looking phone that many of the chubby budget offerings on the market and it would beat the Moto E hands-down in a beauty contest.. It also feels solid and comfortable in hand, and the build quality is decent.. In addition to the designer back, the HTC Desire 530 also offers some cool customisation options in its Sense UI, which sits atop Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. It's very easy to theme the phone and get a look that you like.. On the other hand, HTC's Sense 7 is very intrusive. There are suggestions you don't need for apps to download, widgets that automatically populate themselves with the apps you use, and an alarming array of bloatware. Swipe left to right, for example, and you've got Blinkfeed.. Considering that this is a slow phone with just 16GB of storage, a lighter touch would have been appreciated – the app drawer is more than two full pages before you even install anything..

Buy the HTC Desire 530 - International Unlocked. August 4, 2016 - Written By Alexander Maxham. Smartphones come in all sizes these days, they also come in at all different price points. Many wireless carriers will carry flagship devices like the HTC 10, HTC One A9, Samsung Galaxy S7 and the LG G5, but they also want some of those “cheaper” smartphones. Since most of the customers that walk into their store are not looking to spend a ton of money on a new smartphone. That’s where the budget-friendly HTC Desire 530 fits in. The HTC Desire 530 is available at T-Mobile and Verizon here in the US, but is available unlocked elsewhere in the world. It’s a $159.99 smartphone, and its specs definitely show that. Despite being only $159, how does the HTC Desire 530 stack up? Is it worth its price? Let’s find out in our review.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. The specs for the HTC Desire 530 includes a 5-inch 1280×720 resolution Super LCD display, that gives us a 294 PPI and a 66.2% screen to body ratio. It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 210 (MSM8909) which is a quad-core 1.1Ghz Cortex-A7 processor and it’s paired with the Adreno 304 GPU. Backing that up is 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. HTC does include a micro SD card slot here.. Camera-wise, there is a 8-megapixel shooter around back which features a f/2.4 aperture. The Desire 530 does have a 5-megapixel front-facing shooter with a f/2.8 aperture. Both are capable of recording video at 1080p and include auto-focus. connectivity includes WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth v4.1, A2DP, A-GPS and GLONASS. All of this is powered by a non-removable 2200mAh battery and Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Sense 7.0.. This is a T-Mobile variant of the HTC Desire 530, so naturally it does support all of the bands for T-Mobile and MetroPCS usage. You’ll also be able to use it on GSM networks around the world. The following bands are found on the unlocked or international model of the HTC Desire 530.. LTE Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 20, 28. There’s not much going on in the box here. Right on top is the HTC Desire 530. Below that is your usual paperwork, including a quick start guide and your SIM card if you are switching to T-Mobile or needed a new SIM card. Also included in the box is your wall charger and USB Type-A to micro USB cable. That’s about it for whats in the box. However, HTC did add something extra to the presentation of the box here. Since this is the “Sprinkle White” color of the HTC Desire 530, they have made the box match the color of the device. So the box is white, with “sprinkles” on the front of the box. It’s subtle, but pretty cool looking actually.. The display here is a 5-inch 720p Super LCD panel, which may sound like it’s pretty bad, but it actually isn’t. Since this is just a 5-inch display, the pixel density is still 294 pixels per inch. Not the same as what you’d get from a smartphone that costs around $700, but still pretty decent. The display here works pretty well outdoors. We were able to play Pokemon GO on the Desire 530 without having any issues in seeing the display. That’s important, because many times you’ll be using your smartphone while you’re outside and if you can’t see the display, what’s the point of having the device?. Colors are pretty spot on, with this panel. It’s a Super LCD panel, so we aren’t going to see blacks as dark as you would on an AMOLED display, unfortunately. But those looking for the natural colors, this will work well. Not to mention the fact that HTC does allow you to change the color temperature of the display in the settings. You can make the display warmer or colder, unfortunately, there is no option to change other aspects of the display like saturation and such. But this is better than nothing.. Typically, with smartphones in this price range, we see a pretty terrible digitizer underneath the display. The digitizer is what registers your finger touching the display. So every time you press a button on the screen, the digitizer is what tells the device that the button was pressed. Fortunately, there were no issues with the digitizer here on the HTC Desire 530, although we did notice that it was sometimes tough to scroll in Pokemon GO, especially after playing for a good bit. However that can likely be attributed to the game making the device warm – as we’ve seen the same thing happen on the Nexus 6P.. Something that HTC has been known for, over the years, is their build quality. And that’s no different here with the Desire 530. While the Desire 530 isn’t made of aluminum like their higher-end HTC 10 is, it’s still quite premium, for its price range. It’s sporting a polycarbonate unibody here, which is plastic but it’s not that shiny plastic that leaves all sorts of fingerprints all over the device. In fact, the HTC Desire 530 doesn’t pick up fingerprints at all – other than on the display, but every smartphone picks up fingerprints there. The sides of the device are a bit curved, from the back. It’s nothing like the Galaxy S7 or Galaxy Note 5’s curves, but they are definitely there. Because of that, and the placement of the camera, it does protrude a tiny bit. But the camera does have a nice ring around it to protect it from getting damaged.. Button placement on the HTC Desire 530 is about what you’d expect. The power button and volume rocker are on the right side, with the volume rocker above the power button. With this particular Desire 530, the power button is a reddish-orange color and a bit rigid. Making it easier to tell it apart from the volume rocker. With the volume rocker being black. It definitely stands out from the white frame and back color here. But the colors do match the “sprinkles” found in the color palette. The left side of the device houses the SIM card and micro SD card slot. There is also a slot for a second SIM, but on this T-Mobile model, that second slot is not usable. However the Desire 530 is a dual SIM smartphone. The bottom houses the micro USB port and the top houses the 3.5mm headphone jack.. Also on the back, there’s a place where you can attach a lanyard – which is included in the box – to the Desire 530. Something that not everyone will likely want to use, but it is available for those that want to use it. Since this phone seems to be geared more towards children or teenagers, the lanyard could help keep the phone in their hand and not on the ground. The front of the Desire 530 has the 5-inch display, with on-screen buttons and a front-facing speaker for HTC’s BoomSound. More on that speaker and BoomSound in a bit. The chin and forehead bezels are gray, which looks nice with the color palette on the Desire 530, but it would look better if it were black to blend in with the black frame around the display. The bezels are still pretty thick, even for a sub $200 smartphone. Of course, part of that is due to the front-facing speaker being there.. Build quality here on the Desire 530 is top notch. It’s tough to say that anything in its price range offers a better build. A polycarbonate build that feels solid, yet light, and comfortable in the hand. With it being a 5-inch display, we did expect it to be a bit smaller in the hand. But again, we have to remember that it does have BoomSound which takes up more space, with the speaker being on the front of the device. Overall, HTC surely has hit the ball out of the park with the build quality on the Desire 530. We came away more than impressed here.. Inside, there is the Snapdragon 210 processor. Which is Qualcomm’s lowest end chipset, featuring four Cortex-A7 1.1GHz cores and the Adreno 304 GPU. Suffice it to say, we weren’t expecting anything spectacular from the Snapdragon 210 inside the Desire 530. Now this isn’t going to outperform the Snapdragon 410, 617, 820 or even MediaTek’s Helio P10 and X20, but it is definitely capable. With this being clocked at 1.1GHz, the processor is definitely slow, but not unusable. Although we wouldn’t recommend playing many games on it, at least not graphic intensive games.. The Desire 530 also sports 1.5GB of RAM. Definitely not suitable for hardcore users, but 1.5GB of RAM definitely goes a lot further with Marshmallow than it did with earlier versions of Android. But don’t be surprised if you run out of RAM or your applications in the background close from time to time. On average, we used around 60-70% of the available RAM on the Desire 530. Which is a bit lower than you’d probably expect, especially seeing how much RAM is here.. When it comes to performance, the Desire 530 definitely isn’t going to win any awards, and nor should you expect it to. But it does enough to get by. This smartphone isn’t made for hardcore or heavy users, but the processor and RAM does enough to check your email, Twitter, Facebook, and even play Pokemon GO. Surprisingly, Pokemon GO played pretty well on the Desire 530. Although it did still kill the battery fairly quickly, as expected.. As usual, here with the HTC Desire 530, we ran AnTuTu, GeekBench and 3D Mark on the smartphone. Given its internals, it did score about where we expected it too. Which was below most other smartphones, even recently reviewed smartphones. You can see the results from all three benchmarks down below.. Since this is a T-Mobile smartphone, we did use the device on T-Mobile for about a week. We made plenty of phone calls and used their 4G LTE network, and found zero surprises. We had no dropped calls, and those on the other end said we sounded fine. Since this is a T-Mobile branded smartphone, you do get WiFi Calling here, as well as Voice Over LTE and HD Voice. Which were definitely apparent during our testing. Voice Over LTE had zero issues, calls went through without an issue.. When it comes to data, we got pretty much the same speeds that we do on our daily driver (a Nexus 6P on T-Mobile) in the same areas. So there are no issues here with the 4G LTE radio, nor the WiFi radio as WiFi speeds were also comparable.. Another thing that HTC is well-known for, is their audio. BoomSound debuted with the HTC One M7, way back in 2013, and is still present today, although the meaning has changed a bit. BoomSound is here on the HTC Desire 530, although it’s technically only available through the headphone jack. There is a front-facing speaker, located below the display, and it gives us a great experience. The sound out of that speaker is pretty great, but there’s not much to say about the volume of the audio coming from that speaker. It’s pretty quiet, but at least you have “quality” audio coming out of there.. In the settings, there is an option for BoomSound, which only lights up when you plug in a pair of headphones. Unfortunately, that’s all there is to BoomSound. There’s no equalizer that you can use to adjust the sound to be the way you want it, or anything of that nature. That’s something that audiophiles won’t like particularly. But it is what it is, unfortunately.. Typically, a smartphone with a 2200mAh battery would automatically be written off as having a terrible battery. But that’s not the case here with the HTC Desire 530. Since it does have a 5-inch 720p display and a very low-powered processor, that 2200mAh battery actually does fairly well. We were able to consistently get over 3 hours of on-screen time here, and could likely push it to four hours. Also important to note here that this does include a decent amount of Pokemon GO usage. So if you aren’t a Pokemon GO player, you’ll likely be able to get at least four hours, and maybe even five hours of on-screen time here.. There’s no form of Quick Charge here on the Desire 530, but with it having such a small battery, that doesn’t really matter. The HTC Desire 530 can charge its 2200mAh battery fairly quickly, so having Quick Charge or not isn’t really a deal breaker, in our eyes. The battery can get you through a full day and then some. So just charge it up at night and you’ll be good to go.. For those that might be worried that the HTC Desire 530’s battery cannot get you through the full day, HTC has included a couple different power saving modes here. There’s your regular power saver mode, which you can have set to turn on when you drop to 15%. This will conserve CPU usage, limit location services, reduce screen brightness and turns off vibration feedback. Then there’s extreme power saving mode. Which takes things a bit further. You can opt to turn this on at 20%, 10% or 5% left.. Lately, HTC has been taking a step back with their software, and lining it up a bit closer to stock Android, which is Google’s vision of what Android should be like. But there’s no doubt about it, Sense is still Sense. However, it is a whole lot lighter weight than it was a few years ago. That’s definitely a good thing when it comes to the Desire 530 and it’s fairly low-powered processor. But HTC has still included all of your favorite – or maybe not-so favorite – features of Sense. Including things like BlinkFeed, Themes, and more. HTC’s app drawer is still a vertical scrolling drawer, that is paginated, and it includes quite a bit of bloat apps, thanks to T-Mobile. The T-Mobile apps installed here include Amazon, Device Unlock, Emergency Alerts, Mobile Hotspot, T-Mobile, T-Mobile Name ID, T-Mobile TV, and Visual Voicemail. All of these (except Device Unlock) can be disabled in settings.. When it comes to Themes, HTC has continued to make their theme engine better and better. There are a bunch of themes you can choose from, some that HTC has made and some that designers have made. Not to mention you can create your own theme. You can also piece together parts of themes like the wallpaper, icons, sounds and even fonts. So you can truly make your theme your own. Now, if you want to just change up the color palette of the system apps and such, you don’t need to jump into the theme store. Just go into Settings > Personalize, and you have the option to “Change Accent Colors” right there. Additionally, you can change your wallpaper, add apps and widgets and control ads that are shown in BlinkFeed from there.. BlinkFeed has also changed over the years. Of course, the biggest change is that HTC has inserted ads into BlinkFeed, but you do have the option to turn off these ads, if you wish to do so. BlinkFeed is basically like an RSS Feed, but it brings in content from several social networks as well as publications. You can also include your calendar, so you can stay up-to-date with what’s on your agenda. Blinkfeed allows you to add your Google+, LinkedIn and Twitter profiles. But they also support Mealtime and Watchup. Mealtime will give you recommendations for restaurants, cafes, and bars that are around you, while Watchup gives you the latest videos from many of the top news networks like CNN, Fox, NBC and others. It’s a quick and easy way to stay up-to-date with what’s going on, no matter what network you use or don’t use that often. If you don’t want to use BlinkFeed, you can remove that page from your launcher as well.. The camera experience here on the Desire 530 will be pretty familiar, if you’ve used an HTC device recently. The UI is pretty plain, with most of the settings that you don’t use too often, tucked away. However, you do have quick access to flash, HDR and the camera switcher. So you can take a selfie nice and quick. There are only three modes included on the Desire 530’s camera, which include the Selfie mode (aka the front-facing camera), Camera and Panorama. The shutter can be a bit slow with the Desire 530 camera, although it’s not much of an issue unless you have HDR on. With HDR on, the shutter becomes very slow. And this is due to the processing that it does after it takes the picture. So it’s not ideal for doing burst shot.. When it comes to the actual pictures and videos taken with the camera on the Desire 530, they actually come out looking pretty decent. Of course, these images aren’t going to rival the Galaxy S7’s camera, but for a smartphone in its price range, it performs quite well. Now if you check out the images in the Flickr gallery below, you’ll notice that some of the pictures have quite a bit of noise in them, even ones taken outside in direct sunlight. It doesn’t appear on all of them, but ones that aren’t macro shots, it appears to be worse on. And whatever you do here, do not zoom in to take a picture, it just completely falls apart. Again, that is to be expected, since this isn’t a high-end sensor.. Build Quality: There’s likely no other smartphone in this price range that feels as solid as the Desire 530.. Battery Life: It actually outperforms some flagship smartphones, although that’s likely due to having less tasks going on in the background.. BoomSound: While it’s not the same as the HTC 10’s BoomSound, it’s still pretty awesome to have it on such a cheap smartphone.. Price: It’s at a good price point, although for what we have here, it could probably be a bit lower.. Camera: I’m still a bit in the middle here, with the camera. As it seems that it can take decent pictures, but other times it just fails miserably.. Now normally I wouldn’t bring it up, but ZTE just launched a $99 smartphone with a 6-inch display and a fingerprint sensor. So there’s really no excuse for HTC not having one here.. The Desire 530 is available at T-Mobile (and launching today at Verizon) here in the US. That’s a bit of a downer for HTC. Especially if they were hoping to sell tons of these smartphones. The better idea would be to sell it unlocked on their website.. Going into this review, I was actually expecting a sluggish performing smartphone with a poor camera on the back. Luckily that wasn’t the case here with the Desire 530. Now the Desire 530 isn’t going to be a smartphone that should be bought for anyone that is a heavy user, or plays a lot of big games. But for someone who is an average user and just wants something more basic with a decent build quality, it’s a good and capable smartphone. HTC should have put in a higher-powered processor here though, a Snapdragon 410 would have done well powering the Desire 530.. Should you buy the HTC Desire 530?. The HTC Desire 530 isn’t a bad phone by any stretch of the imagination, but it’s not the best phone either. If you aren’t looking for a phone that is sold by T-Mobile (and are open to unlocked smartphones) I’d say look at the Moto G4 or Moto G4 Plus , both of which we just reviewed. They start at $199, and offer a whole lot more than the HTC Desire 530 does. But if you want something that’s T-Mobile branded – perhaps for WiFi Calling, Voice Over LTE or any other T-Mobile feature – then the HTC Desire 530 is priced pretty well, for what it is..

HTC Desire 530 - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 … 10 11 ». Is it possible to use sd card as internal memory. Bought HTC Desire 530 from Officework in August 2017, started to have problem by December 2017 where not able to "answer" in coming calls as it appears the "answer" on the touch screen is faulty. Also the blue tooth kept switching off by itself. Despite the phone is brand new, and 4 months old, Officework insisted on repair which will takes couple of weeks. Now I am stuck with no phone! Stay away from HTC products!!. It was working good, then a yellow spot appeared on the right side of the screen and now it won't charge, and according to the carrier I am screwed no warranty and I have a protection plan. The phone is in excellent condition never been dropped or wet, they should give me another phone since the battery's are defective but they won't. Well, i have the phone for about 18months... it is not souch a bad phone as others suggest.... it does support an sd card, and i'd recomment upgrading the storage, because it is constantly updating something, and alot of space is used by the apps and android. bat life is as expected for 2000mah batt. when not using, it lasts 2 days minimal on standby, other than that, normal usage requires daily charge (over night). it boots slow, and the camera is not too good, it is just ok. It is loud enough, and mic is good, so that is a plus. it is a phone for regular light user. i use it alot to stream youtube on my tv, so.... for a cheap phone, it is ok. I don't know what u complain about. phone its ok for normal user, if i wanted to work like PC with ssd i would get 500$ phone, its its very ok, i have viber, insta, fb lite and rayman in back. and about 500mb free ram, has like 5,5 gb free with 4,5 games... battery can do 2 days with a bit everything,but its not important at all battery will be full for 1h and 45 min so its nothing, everything its amazing, 3d icons and own HTC store , camera its nice, both of them, sound its nice also, 4g. 130 $ i could never ask for more. You get what you pay for. A lot of storage is used up for system itself. I would recommend buying an SD card for the phone if u have lots of files/ music/ downloads/ pictures etc. It certainly is an efficient, affordable and sleek Android phone for everyday use.. Bought this for budget reasons due to an embarrassing incident with my prior phone and I am flat out double embarrassed that I did. Not only do I have to pay so little for a device that I can hardly use but I have to hard boot every time I run out of juice on the damn thing. You know what that is? Emergency menu and reboot from there. Not exactly my kind of startup process. Even coming from a Windows PC background. Bottom line is that if you see this on eBay or any kind of carrier closeout (even the big red V like in my case) then just click right past and go to the next lowest price. Never did I have the words "get what you pay for" blast my brain so much. People I know want me to get rid of it and so far I resisted the call because fixed income (which is also why I bought it as the cheapest one I could get on the Verizon website). Sadly I am going to have to pay a junker or something and pay the price, except that I now have to jack up the family account because consolidated services. Don't make the same mistake, even in the same exact conditions I did. Heck, I am even going to consider Rift over Vive as a gamer if I ever try VR just because I have no respect for HTC because of this (and that says something for someone who used their brand in the past).. Again like I said I will give it a proper review as well..FYI..To be able to review a phone you got to personally have it in your hands first and try it in every way as well..Those bad comments are not very convincing about this phone.. I am about to buy this phone because it seems to be great for having I have read many reviews I believe on the good ones given not the bad ones I'm going to try it my self and will give it a proper review as well.. Please DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. It is possibly the worst economical mistake I have commited in my life. IT TAKES AGES FOR THE BATTERY TO BE FULL. I have been having this phone for about a year and it brings me constant rage. Whats worst the BATTERY DRAINS SOOOO FAST. The camera is very crappy and it took me to travel to leagues of shops to find a screen protector for this pile of junk.. Phone work fine and it's 16gb so you end up with around 7gb free so don't listen to people who say there's no storage, if they knew who to control a phone "properly" they wouldn't moan, just don't update apps you don't use, and as for the battery unless your sitting in the sun turn down your screen brightness... These amateurs who pretend they are phone experts and write reviews.. but haven't got a ucking iglue. Please do not buy this phone. This phone has caused me so much rage. I had it for about 8 months and during the last 5 months the battery constantly says using too much power even though i have no apps running. I only have music and a few small social media apps and my phone was always less than 2 gb due to the htc factory installed apps. This phones camera is slow as it takes about 4 seconds to finally snap. I just broke my phone with a cleaver on purpose and im never buying a trash phone like this again.. I bought the phone 4 months ago, but I didn't try whether it support SD card or not. Later I realized that my desire 530 doesn't support SD card. This is my first time of using HTC phone, but am a little bit disappointed in the HTC company. The internal memory for the apps and other files is only 0.98MB.. Anonymous, 15 Apr 2017 What is the wrong please ? I askq because I want to buy it. I have had this phone for about a year and a half I have some good and bad things about it. My cons are the battery, it it pretty worthless it constantly just drains. I had recently got an exchange from a watery because my phone battery jumped from 80% to 3% when I had restated my phone when the phone wouldn't open any apps. I do indeed like the camera and just the screen in general. I went to a HTC because it sounded positive Island I can no longer agree with my previous thoughts.. Jack Of All, 05 Mar 2017 I bought this for my mother. This is my first HTC and I am not impressed. more I am having mine for almost a year now and the battery overheating only when I charge it in hot weather not carrying it outside of my bag or pants. The crashes only started occurring after the phone updated something so now I have to be a bit carefull when operating it .I have never seen my phone go in root mode. But I put my phone in developer mode so maybe that's the reason. This phone is great! I have always used Nokia before and have tried different brands which i haven't liked. HTC is really simple to use, is reliable, fast and works perfectly all the time.. Iam from iran this phone is bad and i have this. For hours trying, yet I could not even put on a sim card..

Andreas Kilian ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 06/29/2016. ARM Android Touchscreen Smartphone. Everyone's Desire? HTC offers a new smartphone in the 200-Euro (~$222) category. The Desire 530 aims to impress buyers with a unique design, decent cameras and unusually good sound among other things. Our test reveals whether the smartphone can fulfill this high claim despite entry-level hardware..

Best Notebooks for University Students Â». Top Windows alternatives to Apple's MacBook series Â». Â» Tablets , Â» Windows Tablets Â» Smartphones. For the original German review, see here .. The Desire 530 offers something that even the considerably higher priced. - the manufacturer's top model - cannot offer: Uniqueness. The color options "gray remix" and "white remix" adorn the smartphone's casing with randomly splashed contrasting colors. However, the handsets are also available in the basic color if the buyer does not like this pattern. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 210 , this eye-catching casing does not carry a particularly strong SoC. and the RAM configuration of 1.5 GB is not generous. On the other hand, a decent 16 GB of storage and the option of expanding this via micro-SD slot are on board.. Currently, the review sample is sold at market prices starting at approximately 185 Euros (~$205) Thus, price wise it does not compete with the recently released. mid-range models, but rather with the former.

While the width of 70.9 millimeters (~2.8 in) is still within the usual range for smartphones with a 5-inch screen, with a length of 146.9 millimeters (~5.8 in), HTC's Desire 530 is 4 to 5 millimeters (~0.16 to 0.2 in) longer than most other rivals. It is 8.3 millimeters (~0.33 in) tall (approx. 9.1 mm/~0.36 in in the camera's area) and its sides are relatively high. Therefore, although the handset gives a robust impression, it does not look particularly elegant.. The various, differently sized, gold-colored speckles and the matching design of the power button set color accents on the dark-gray plastic unibody. The glass surface on the front is framed by a matte area near the speakers' openings. Overall, the build quality is acceptable, but the handset does not really feel high-quality due to the choice of materials.. The stability of the Desire 530 is only average. It can be warped slightly and moderate pressure on the touchscreen and handset's back causes wave formation on the screen. However, it is positive that the review sample does not produce noise then. The maintenance options are limited to the two card slots on the side; the user cannot replace the battery.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. With 16 GB of storage, the Desire 530 offers an appropriate storage capacity for the price range. The user still has about 10 GB for personal use in the state of delivery. According to the manufacturer, the micro-SD slot support cards of up to 2 TB capacity - since cards with a maximum of 256 GB are currently available, the user is perfectly set up for the future. Although the smartphone does not support moving apps to the memory card, thanks to Android 6.0 it can be formatted as an internal storage. However, HTC recommends using a fast micro-SD card with UHS Class 3 bus. This function cannot be utilized when a slower UHS Class 1 card is inserted.. In terms of connectivity, the Desire 530 fulfills only the basic needs: A 3.5 mm headset jack is installed for audio output, and a micro-USB port is integrated for data sharing. The latter does not support OTG. Although Wi-Fi Direct is installed, transmitting images via Miracast is not possible. However, media can be streamed via DLNA. Some users will also miss the notification LED found in many Android devices.. Left: Flap for both card slots. Upper edge: 3.5 mm headset jack. HTC has equipped the Desire 530 with the latest Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow ex-factory and as usual covers it with its own UI, HTC Sense. Compared with Google's Android version, it provides other icons, backgrounds and widgets. Furthermore, there is a news feed page on the left of the home screen which can be disabled if required. Another striking modification concerns the app drawer through which the user scrolls vertically rather than horizontally.. In addition to the usual Google software, HTC has preloaded several third-party programs. Facebook and Facebook Messenger, News Republic and Instagram apps are on the smartphone ex-factory. Proprietary apps, such as a video and image editor, are also found. None of these can be uninstalled and can only be disabled in the settings. However, the fact that they can be updated in Google's Play Store is a special feature.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

HTC's Desire 530 communicates with Wi-Fi networks only in the 2.4 GHz frequency band. Nevertheless, a maximum gross transmission rate of 150 Mbit/s was accomplished in the test using an Asus RT-AC56U router. The mobile wireless module supports diverse wireless standards. The LTE frequencies commonly used in Germany are among them (band 3, 7 & 20). Data can be downloaded at a maximum of 150 Mbit/s and uploaded at 51 Mbit/s in the Cat4 standard. Bluetooth 4.1 and NFC are available for near field communication.. The integrated GPS module found the user's position quickly in the outdoors. It only needed a little longer in the upper story of a building. The smartphone's accuracy of up to 3 meters (~9.9 ft) in both cases was quite decent. We took the Desire 530 along with Garmin's Edge 500 GPS bike computer on a bike ride for a better evaluation of the handset's navigation capabilities. The smartphone did not exhibit any major weaknesses. In direct comparison of the two devices, there were straight-lined shortcuts in some places, e.g. crossing the bridge, which are due to less frequent position updates. The total difference between the two devices is only about 110 meters (~361 ft), which is less than 1%. Thus, the Desire 530 should be quite suitable for navigation.. Garmin Edge 500 - Turning point.

The phone app in the Desire 530 offers a relatively wide range of functions on 5 sub-pages. This includes an extensive call list, keypad for entering phone numbers directly, favorite lists and direct access to contacts saved in the phone book.. The smartphone produces a quite natural sound via the earpiece during normal calls. Only minor static noise marred it slightly. The other call party could hear us clearly. The integrated hands-free mode in HTC's Desire 530 offers a decent, though not very loud sound. The contact complained about a too quiet and tinny sounding voice in this mode. The included headset is good and both callers could be heard clearly, but the transmitted sound is slightly more muffled on both sides than when using the earpiece. Overall, we can confirm HTC's Desire 530 has a decent telephony performance, especially since no irregularities were observed in reception.. HTC's product description , both cameras in the Desire 530 shoot brilliant photos. The first doubts arise when reading the specification: With 8 megapixels and an aperture of f/2.4 or 5 megapixels and f/2.8 in the webcam, the review sample cannot outbid any of the comparison models. However, as usual, we took various test photos since figures are not inevitably an indicator for image quality.. The primary camera gives a category-typical impression. Although the resolution is sufficient for smaller prints, visible flaws are seen in full-screen views on a large PC monitor. Details â flora in particular - blur visibly (scene 2). Furthermore, the color saturation of our sample photo of a bridge (scene 1) is very low in the darker areas - the photo is almost monochrome here. The Desire 530 copes decently indoors (scene 3), although photos blur more frequently in low-light conditions.. The webcam's photos are also typical of the category. Under ideal light conditions, relatively many details can be recognized in the foreground. However, the pictures become increasingly vague as the ambient light is dimmed. The quality is acceptable for occasional selfies and posting on social media platforms, especially since an optional software soft-focus, "Makeup Level", is often applied in these cases.. Both cameras record videos in 720p at 30 frames per second. The colors look very rich, but the videos cannot compete with Full HD recordings of better equipped smartphones in terms of detail drawing. It is also too bad that the primary camera's auto focus is not active during recordings. Overall, the soundtrack sounds pleasingly natural, although a background noise is heard for about two and a half seconds at the beginning of every recording. Furthermore, the stereo balance of our review sample was unbalanced and the right channel sounded slightly louder.. The camera apps do not provide the user with setting options for ISO rates and white balance as found in, for example,. However, HDR and a panorama mode are present. The latter shoots almost transition-free panoramas with a width of just less than 180Â° - however, the vertical resolution is clearly reduced and the photos look very dark.. Overall, both cameras deliver a category-typical average performance without any real highlights. Nevertheless, they should be enough for occasional snapshots for most users.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. To test the color accuracy of the primary camera in the Desire 530, we compare a photo of X-Rite's ColorChecker Passport under controlled light conditions with the actual reference colors. The photo is not edited afterward, e.g. It is very clear that the review sample displays most colors much darker and more saturated than they really are - particularly the red tones. Furthermore, the lightly brownish grayscale levels show that the entire photo has too warm a color temperature.. To evaluate the camera lens' reproduction performance and general resolution capacity, we take a full-frame photo of our test chart under defined artificial light. This shows that the primary camera - as already observed in the sample photos - does not have a particularly high resolution. On the other hand, the photo's homogeneity is a pleasant surprise. The sharpness hardly decreases even toward the corners. Some competing devices exhibit weaknesses here, for example. Original colors are displayed in the lower half of each patch.. In addition to the smartphone itself, a 5-watt plug (1 A/5 V) and a micro-USB cable, an in-ear headset and a wrist strap is found in the box of HTC's Desire 530. HTC does not have product-specific accessories for the tested model on the German market in its lineup. However, multi-colored Snap Case covers that are available in some regions are found on the manufacturer's product page.. HTC includes a two-year warranty for its smartphone. However, this is limited to one year for the included accessories.. The default keyboard preloaded by HTC, "HTC Sense Input", fills the available space on the screen well. We also liked the fact that the middle keys are slightly larger than standard for better accessibility with the thumb for inputting text in landscape mode. However, after initial setup, a QWERTY keyboard was displayed despite the German language setting. It was possible to switch to the standard German QWERTZ layout via the option menu afterward. The relatively inaccurate vibration feedback can be completely disabled should the user find it more annoying than helpful. Text inputting via swipe is also possible.. The touchscreen made a good impression in the test. Fingers glide smoothly over its sleek surface, making it easy to input accurately. The few physical keys have a clearly defined pressure point and are fitted with little play in the casing. It is also pleasing that the power button's waved texture differentiates it palpably from the volume control above it. The position sensor quickly detects rotation when the smartphone is turned.. It is also subjectively pleasing that the user can navigate through the different menus smoothly despite the installed entry-level hardware. Most preloaded apps also start without much delay. Then again, installing larger programs is noticeably sluggish and the sometimes prolonged waiting times when browsing on the Internet is not as pleasing.. A 5-inch LCD screen with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels is installed in HTC's Desire 530. This results in a pixel density of 294 PPI. It is on par with all the other rivals. Thus, pixilation is not visible at a normal seating distance and the display looks sufficiently sharp.. The average maximum brightness on a completely white screen is 376 cd/mÂ². This rate changes only marginally to a somewhat lower 366 cd/mÂ² when we measure the screen with equally distributed dark and bright areas (average picture level/APL50). Activating the Desire 530's light sensor does not present any brightness reserves, either. Although it outshines two of the rivals also equipped with IPS panels, namely. ZTE's Blade V6 , it cannot outbid the much brighter. and Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016). Due to the relatively low black level of 0.32 cd/mÂ² for IPS conditions, the Desire 530's screen does not offer a high contrast with 1172:1. Furthermore, no clouding was visible when dark objects were displayed on the screen.. Beyond that, it is pleasing that the installed screen does not use PWM for controlling brightness and therefore flickering is not visible.. 354 cd/m² 370 cd/m² 385 cd/m² 383 cd/m² 375 cd/m² 380 cd/m² 387 cd/m² 372 cd/m² 382 cd/m². 91 % Center on Battery: 375. cd/m²) ΔE Color 6 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 4.5 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.26.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display.

Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. The panel displays grayscale levels with an average DeltaE deviation of 4.5 and colors with a DeltaE deviation of 6 in standard settings (ideal range <3 in both cases). The color temperature of 6975 K is slightly above the ideal rate of 6500 K. When required, the temperature can be increased or reduced by several levels in the display options. However, the color aberrations increase then. With these results the Desire 530 achieves an average placement in the comparison. ZTE's Blade V6 is much poorer..

It is recommended to look for a place in the shade with the Desire 530 for trouble-free outdoor use. Although the screen is legible with some effort in direct sunlight, all reflections have to be avoided to recognize displayed contents.. The review sample presents weaknesses in viewing angle stability. On the one hand, brightness drops visibly very early, and on the other, colors shift to either warmer or cooler color tones from certain viewing angles. It is a positive that colors never invert.. by Qualcomm is the heart piece of the Desire 530. It clocks at a maximum of 1.1 GHz and has four entry-level Cortex A7 cores. A total of 1.5 GB working memory supports the processor. Since the 3DMark Slingshot test based on OpenGL ES 3.0 did not present any valid scores, it is not listed in the comparison charts. The smartphone generally does not support benchmarks based on OpenGL ES 3.1.. The review sample achieves the last place in PCMark, AnTuTu and Geekbench. It also scores very poorly in Basemark OS II. However, the extremely bad Web Score is mainly responsible for this. To rule out that it is just a temporary error, we performed the benchmark several times and always achieved the same outcome. Compared with the CPU, the GPU does a slightly better job in the comparison group, which is reflected in the 3DMark tests. At least, the Desire 530 can sometimes keep.

Both the sequential read rate of 35.56 MB/s as well as the sequential write rate of 18.22 MB/s are below average.

Its performance is situated in the entry-level sector. Thus, demanding games such as " Real Racing 3 " or " Asphalt 8 " do not run quite smoothly in high details. However, a sufficiently high frame rate can be achieved when settings are reduced. Although " Asphalt 8 " only runs at an average of 31 FPS, it can be played without major restrictions, if the user can tolerate some minor stutters. The integrated position senor and reliably functioning touchscreen did not cause problems in gaming situations.. The Desire 530 does not break any records with maximum load temperatures of approximately 38 Â°C (~100 Â°F), but it does not heat up significantly. does a much better job among the opponents;. To exclude performance throttling during permanent load, we performed the battery test of GFXBench that launches the T-Rex test thirty times successively and logs the available performance and battery consumption. Since the single performance rates are within a fluctuation range of just 2%, throttling is not an issue for the Desire 530.. 37.1 °C 37 °C 36.8 °C. 37.2 °C 37 °C 36.4 °C. 35.8 °C 36.8 °C 34.5 °C.

The Desire 530's speaker is located on the casing's front, below the screen. Hands will rarely cover it here and its sound will not change when the smartphone is placed on a surface.. Subjectively, the speaker produces a somewhat thin sound characteristic without noteworthy bass. The clarity of speech is nevertheless very decent. Furthermore, annoying distortions are not produced even at maximum volume. With a measured 87.4 dB(A) in the Pink Noise test, it is also sufficiently high although other smartphones seem to render music slightly louder. Objectively, the speaker barely uses the frequency range below 500 Hz, but at least shows an almost linear frequency response above 700 Hz up to about 8 kHz.. The supplied headset pleases with a quite natural sound impression. However, fans of powerful bass playback will not be very happy with it. Optionally, it is also possible to enable "HTC BoomSound" for improving the sound.. According to our synoptic table, the Desire 530 clearly draws the short straw compared with its rivals. However, we have been using a new and more accurate instrument for some months, making the rate of. only partially comparable with the other smartphones..

Despite its relatively high power consumption, HTC's Desire 530 can serve with decent battery runtimes. Although it does not achieve the very good rates of Samsung's. Galaxy J3 (2016) with 7 hours and 5 minutes, it can - even if only marginally - outrun the other comparison devices, especially in the practical Wi-Fi test. It is situated midfield in the "Big Buck Bunny" video playback test.. Enabling the energy-savings mode that limits CPU performance, screen brightness and location services, and disabling vibration feedback retrieves a little more runtime from the smartphone. An even longer runtime can be achieved with the "Extreme Power Saving" mode. However, the smartphone's functions are then also extremely limited. Only predefined programs, such as SMS, email and the calendar app, are then available.. Idle (without WLAN, min brightness) 18h. NBC WiFi Websurfing Battery Test 1.3 (Chrome 50) 7h.

Whether HTC's attempt at making a unique design statement with the Desire 530 has been successful is probably a matter of taste. Regardless of that, the casing pleases with its decent build and good hardware buttons. However, it hardly conveys a high-quality feeling due to the choice of materials, and in particular since it is quite large for a smartphone with a 5-inch screen. The modern operating system, the option of expanding the storage via micro-SD card and the decent battery life in particular, are all positive. However, it is too bad that the handset only offers average fare in terms of cameras and the not quite viewing angle stable panel. Furthermore, the overall performance is often lower than that of the comparison devices.. HTC's Desire 530 adds a splash of color to the rather broad mass of affordable Android devices. However, the smartphone barely offers any technical highlights. Buyers will therefore probably opt for the handset for design reasons and the modern Android user interface.. Good alternatives for the Desire 530 are found in the opponents named in the test.. is currently about 35 Euros (~$39) cheaper than the review sample with a price of 150 Euros (~$166).
