ZTE Blade V8 Mini - user opinions and reviews. I don't need "shovel" with 5.5 or larger, my optimal is 4.7-5. Phones larger then 5.2 is too heavy and looks stupid.. The phone has a very solid feeling. The screen has a good shine, and it's pretty fluid playing video games. Despite being a small battery, it seems that ZTE optimizes the operating system well, since it lasts two days the battery, listening to.... Today, phones are regularly larger than 5 inches.

What is a hands on review?. The ZTE V8 Mini Pro provides a quick upgrade to new software and features, with Android 7.0 Nougat onboard and a dual-lens camera that produces photos you can refocus. It has a budget-friendly Qualcommm chipset that makes it affordable if you're on a tight budget.. Mini USB in a USB-C future. Design and display ZTE Blade V8 Mini camera and specs Early verdict. The ZTE Blade V8 Mini offers one of the cheapest ways to upgrade to the latest version of Google's operating system and walk away with a dual-lens camera.. The ultra-affordable Android 7.0 Nougat smartphone that we tested at MWC 2017 is the lighter variant of the ZTE Blade V8 Pro revealed at CES 2017.. It's interesting to see how quickly flagship features on the iPhone and Samsung devices features from a year ago can come to budget handsets.. The ZTE Blade V8 Mini doesn't have the most powerful specs, of course, but it's got plenty for people who are casual phone owners who want a fancy camera.. The ZTE Blade V8 Mini has a 5-inch HD screen, meaning it's at the lower 720p resolution. It's more powerful than the ZTE Blade V8 Lite, but it lacks in pixel count.. That doesn't really show, because it looks just as good as the other Blade V8 phones that are Full HD at 1080p. The screen brightness only takes a minor hit.. It has a one-hand friendly design at 143.5 x 70 x 8.9mm in a metallic body, which was surprising. It doesn't feel like a very cheap phone.. There's a circular fingerprint sensor pad on back and mini USB port on the bottom, and yes you do get a headphone jack on this phone.. There's a small camera bump for the. dual lens camera, but that's fully worth it for better photos. The ZTE Blade V8 Mini's big highlight is the dual-lens camera that's made up of a. 13MP and 2MP rear camera and combines into one photo.. We tested out the bokeh-filled shots and were impressed with the lens blur on a cheap phone. In further testing, we'll see how it stacks up to the iPhone 7 Plus portrait mode.. You can refocus photos in post, which is something the new iPhone can't do, and the Blade Mini camera supports 3D shooting to generate 3D photos.. On the front, it has a 5MP camera, and there's plenty of Beauty Mode to go around. We'll have to test out both cameras outside of MWC 2017 before adding a review verdict.. We already have a good idea about how the specs perform, with the Qualcomm 435 chipset, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage and a microSD card slot. It's not meant for serious gaming, but it's enough for most everything else.. While the battery isn't removable, it does have a 2,800mAh capacity battery. What should help out is the fact that it runs Android 7.0 Nougat, which contains a bunch of battery-saving tricks like Doze Mode 2.0.. If you're looking for a dual-lens camera phone and are on a serious enough budget that the ZTE Blade Pro seems unaffordable, then this phone is a very close substitute.. It has the 13MP and 2MP camera for bokeh-filled shots that have a readjustable focus, and the metallic design is impressive.. While we don't have the final ZTE Blade V8 Mini price and release date, it's supposed to initially come to Asia and Europe at a cheaper price than the ZTE Blade V8 Pro..

CNET también está disponible en español.. ZTE rolls out two budget-friendly Blade V8 phones at MWC. The Blade V8 Mini and Lite are 5-inch phones from ZTE that are expected to go easy on your wallet.. by February 27, 2017 1:01 AM PST. ZTE's Blade V8 Mini and Lite won't break the bank.

Cost-conscious buyers take note: ZTE's budget-friendly phone family is growing.. At the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona today, ZTE took the wraps off two mid-tier phones from its Blade series. Though neither handsets are particularly noteworthy in terms of specs and features, they promise to be easy on the wallet.. MWC 2017: All the gadgets announced so far. The first in the pair is the Blade V8 Mini. It features two cameras: a 13- and 2-megapixel shooter on the back. Similar to the Apple iPhone 7 Plus , the dual-camera setup lets you shoot photos with blurred backgrounds, for an artsy "bokeh" effect. You can also refocus an image with this effect after you've already clicked the shutter.. ZTE's Blade V8 Mini and Lite won't break the bank. The two cameras can also render "3D" images by combining two photos together. We'll know more about how these tools work once we get our hands on the device. The Blade V8 Lite in various colors.. ZTE also announced the Blade V8 Lite. Apparently inspired by "French upholstery" (whatever that means), the phone comes in black, gold and silver. It also has a 5-inch display but its lower battery capacity and standard 8-megapixel camera mean its specs are a bit scaled down compared to the Mini. These phones aren't particularly exciting given their mid-range specs, but they're expected to be competitively priced and may be good if you're in the market for a cheap Android phone. The V8 Mini will be available in countries in Asia Pacific and Europe, while the V8 Lite will roll out to Italy, Germany and Spain.. Neither phones will come to the US, though we do have one the Blade V8 Pro , announced this year at CES, which features slightly better specs.. Click here for CNET's complete coverage of MWC 2017 ..

Wi-Fib/g/n, BT 4.1, FM radio, GPS. Wi-Fib/g/n, BT 4.1, FM radio, GPS. After announcing the Blade V8 Pro at CES 2017, ZTE added two more phones to the Blade V8 family: the Blade V8 Mini and Blade V8 Lite. Both phones are smaller than the previously announced models, featuring 720p 5-inch IPS LCD screens, and they target lower price points.. The Blade V8 Mini uses the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 SoC as the Blade V8, with 8 A53 CPU cores that top out at 1.4GHz. The Blade V8 Lite swaps to a MediaTek MT6750 SoC, which also has an octa-core A53 CPU configuration that reaches up to 1.5GHz. Given the similarities, all three phones should deliver similar system performance, but none of them will excel at gaming. Both the Mini and the Lite come with 2GB of LPDDR3 RAM and 16GB of internal storage, which is somewhat limiting, but storage is expandable via microSD card.. * Blade V8 Pro not shown (5.5-inch 1080p LCD, Snapdragon 625, 3140 mAh). While both new phones come with a 5MP selfie camera, only the Mini has a front-facing flash feature, which is far from ubiquitous and nice to see on a lower-cost phone. The Mini also includes the same dual camera (13MP + 2MP) module as the Blade V8. The second 2MP sensor helps capture depth information that can be used to apply a bokeh effect to images or to adjust the object of focus after a photo has been taken, features usually reserved for more expensive phones.. The smaller, one-hand friendly V8’s have a lightly-textured aluminum chassis with plastic RF windows at the top and bottom. There’s an inset fingerprint sensor on the back of each too. The rear camera module, which sits proud of the back surface, is an elongated oval that’s centered at the top of the phone. In the Mini’s case, there’s a camera in each corner with an LED flash in between but offset from center. The Lite uses a similar design for the camera module, with its lone 8MP sensor offset to the left of the centered flash.. Both phones use backlit capacitive navigation buttons. The larger, circular home button is a nice visual touch, and the other buttons are simple dots, allowing for customization. There’s a black border around the screen that’s noticeable on the color combinations with white fronts, but this is typical for phones in this price bracket.. All of the phones in ZTE’s Blade V8 series, except for the mid-range Blade V8 Pro that uses USB Type-C, still come with microUSB ports. There’s no 802.11ac Wi-Fi or NFC either, although they do come with Bluetooth and FM radio. It’s nice to see the Mini and Lite ship with Android 7 too.. The ZTE Blade V8 Mini in silver, gold, black, red, and pink is coming to select markets in Asia and Europe, while the Blade V8 Lite will be available. in Italy, Germany, and Spain i n silver, gold, and black colors. Pricing is not available at this time, but should be well below $200 USD considering the Blade V8 Pro’s price.. Please log in or sign up to comment.. Valis - Thursday, March 02, 2017 - link. I'm utterly disappointed in the manufacturers as of late, only Sony and Samsung (A3) makes a phone under 130-135mm with 4.5-4.7" (720p or better) screen and good battery life. Have to go back to the first Gen of Moto X to get something decent, but that one has rather sub par battery. BrokenCrayons - Friday, March 03, 2017 - link. 5 inches doesn't make a "mini" anything when it comes to phones. asmian - Friday, March 03, 2017 - link. The capitalisation in the article title is misleading. Is the name of this product family " The Blade"? Proved yet again, Anandtech badly needs a dedicated (and actually proficient) editor on staff... asmian - Friday, March 03, 2017 - link. And actually, just looking at the sidebar pipeline story list, the inconsistency in proper capitalisation of titles is shocking for a well-respected publishing site. :( There are well-understood grammatical conventions for this. Readers' respect for content is coloured by the professionalism of its presentation, and the site owners should be aware of this. That's why more active editing is badly needed here. a1exh - Tuesday, March 07, 2017 - link. The previous Blade phones used Snapdragon 600 series processors. So why have they switched to 400 series?

Hands on with the ZTE Blade V8 Lite and the Blade V8 Mini. by John Velasco February 27, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. ZTE is going all in with. Following the launch of the Blade V8 Pro. and the regular V8 a few days later, the company has just taken the wraps off of the Mini and Lite versions of the device. As the names suggest, these devices fall at lower-end of the specifications spectrum, but do continue to offer some unique features like their more powerful siblings. We go hand on and give you a quick look at the ZTE Blade V8 Mini and the Blade V8 Lite !. The Blade V8 Mini features a design language that is largely similar to the Blade V8, with a metal unibody construction. A touch of style can be seen at the top on the rear in the section that houses the camera, with a sharp color contrast to be found. With a 5-inch display, the device is relatively compact and also lightweight, allowing for a comfortable handling experience.. As mentioned, the specs do fall towards the lower-end, with the V8 Mini coming with a 720p display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor,. 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of on-board storage, microSD card support, and a 2,800mAh battery. There is also a fingerprint scanner on the back for an added layer of security. The V8 Mini will run Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box, which is great to see happen in the affordable smartphone segment.. Like its larger and more powerful siblings, the standout feature of the Blade V8 Mini is its camera setup. The devices comes with a 13 MP and 2 MP dual rear camera system, which will allow for some nice bokeh effects, along with the ability to re-focus a shot after the fact. There is also a 3D shooting mode, that will let you take photos from different angles and combine them to create a 3D image that can be enjoyed using a VR headset. The phone also comes with a 5 MP front-facing shooter.. The pricing information and when it will be available is still unknown, but the Blade V8 Mini is slated for release soon in various European and Asian markets, and is a great option for those looking for a budget-friendly device with a unique camera setup and features.. The ZTE Blade V8 Lite features the exact same design as the V8 Mini, with it also featuring a metal body. The only real difference between the two, apart from the specifications, is the fact that the V8 Lite only comes with a single rear camera. It has kept the same design though, so it may look like a dual camera setup at first glance, but the extended black bar at the top of the V8 Lite is essentially just to maintain a uniform aesthetic.. On the specs side of things, you get a 5-inch display with a 720p resolution,. an octa-core MediaTek MT 6750 processor, 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of on-board storage, microSD card support, an 8 MP rear camera, and a 5 MP front-facing unit. There is a fingerprint sensor on the back for extra security, and the V8 Lite is also going to be running Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box.. Once again, the pricing and availability of the V8 Lite is unknown, but considering the specs, we can certainly expect it to fall in the ultra-affordable segment. The Blade V8 Lite will soon be released in various European and Asian markets as well.. So, there you have it for this quick look at the ZTE Blade V8 Mini and V8 Lite.

What’s the difference: ZTE Blade V8 Pro vs Blade V8 Mini vs Blade V8 Lite. Which ZTE Blade V8 model should you be getting?. ZTE introduced the ZTE Blade V8 Pro at CES 2017, as an affordable dual-camera phone. Then at MWC 2017, the company pulled off the wraps of two new variants, the Blade V8 Mini and Blade V8 Lite .. Now, if are a bit confused about the differences between the three devices, you have come to the right place. In what follows we’re going to compare the tree phones, so you can get a clear idea of the specs offered by each product. ZTE has done a great job with these phones, in terms of design and functionalities and especially price. So check out what each brings to the table:. 5.5-inch with 1920 x 1080 resolution vs 5-inch with 720 x 1280 resolution vs 5-inch 720 x 1280 resolution. 401ppi vs 294 ppi vs 294 ppi. The ZTE Blade V8 Mini and ZTE Blade V8 Lite are watered down versions of the ZTE Blade V8 Pro. They bring forth smaller displays but less impressive resolution. So if you’re looking for an upper mid-ranger, the Blade V8 Pro is certainly the model to consider. However, for regular use the screens of the Blade V8 Mini and Blade V8 Lite should be more than enough.. Snapdragon 625 vs vs Snapdragon 435 vs MediaTek MT6750. Adreno 506 vs Adreno 505 vsMali-T860MP2. 3GB of RAM vs 2GB of RAM vs 2GB of RAM. Naturally, the Blade V8 Pro is going to be the most responsive of the three, as it relies on a Snapdragon 625 – an octa-core 2.0GHz Cortex-A53 affair. As for the Blade V8 Mini it features a Snapdragon 435 which is a octa-core 1.4GHz Cortex-A53 chipset, while the MediaTek MT6750 inside the Blade V8 Lite is an octa-core 1.5GHz Cortex-A53 construct.. The Blade V8 Pro offers more RAM and built-in storage, but all models carry a microSD card slot onboard which allows for memory expansion up to 256GB.. Dual 13MP+13MP/8MP vs dual 13MP+2MP/5MP vs 8MP/5MP. The Blade V8 Pro can be considered a remarkable device especially because it offers a dual camera setup on the cheap. But ZTE has just lowered the price bar for dual camera phones with the Blade V8 Mini.. Anyway the main setup on the Blade V8 Pro delivers phase detection autofocus and dual-LED flash. The phone also has a pretty decent 8MP selfie snapper.. As for the Blade V8 Mini, ZTE says it’s the perfect phone for photography enthusiasts. It features a dual-camera with a dedicated Bokeh feature onboard which allows you to blur the background while focusing on a certain subject. The phone also supports 3D shooting which combines two images to deliver a 3D photo. It has manual mode, auto HDR and LED flash.. O the Blade V8 Mini, the selfie camera is only of a 5MP variety, but it does feature LED flash.. Last but not least, the Blade V8 Lite doesn’t offer a dual-camera setup. You’ll find the phone hosts a “regular” 8MP rear camera with autofocus and LED flash and a 5MP self-portrait frontal snapper.. Android 6.0 Marshmallow vs Android 7.0 Nougat vs Android 7.0 Nougat. The newest ZTE Blade V8 phones come with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box, while the Blade V8 Pro ships out with Android 6.0 Marshmallow (a shame really, for a device launched in 2017). We don’t know whether the phone will get Android 7.0 Nougat in the future or not, but we certainly hope this will be the case.. 3,140 mAh vs 2,800 mAh vs 2,500 mAh. The Blade V8 Pro is known for having a great battery life cycle and with Android 7.0 Nougat onboard, it might get even better in the future. As for the two new Blade V8 models, we expect them to last quite a lot, given that they feature low-res displays, less power hungry processors and the new Android onboard. The Blade V8 Pro is currently available for $229 on Amazon. However, pricing specifications for the Blade V8 Mini and Blade V8 Lite haven’t been revealed just yet. We expect it to be below the $200 margin which is quite exciting.. We’re keeping an eye out for the Blade V8 Mini in particular, since it will probably offer the best value for those looking to grab a dual-camera phone..

ZTE Blade V8 Mini Smartphone Review. Thomas Meyer ( translated by Ariana Brodsky), 11/23/2017. An inexpensive smartphone with a dual camera. ZTE is expanding their lower mid-range product line. Alongside the ZTE Blade V8 64 GB, the Chinese smartphone manufacturer has now introduced the ZTE Blade V8 Mini to the mobile market.

The ZTE Blade V8 Mini's dual camera is unusual in this price bracket. For the original German review, see here .. Chinese manufacturers are jumping more and more into the European and American markets. The best known example is undoubtedly Huawei, but other manufacturers from Southeast Asia â such as ZTE â are expanding their presence. ZTE, the publicity-seeking 2016 co-sponsor of the Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach football club, is now offering the ZTE Blade V8 Mini as another device with a good range of features at an intriguing price.. The highlight of the ZTE Blade V8 Mini is certainly the dual camera, with a maximum resolution of 13 MP and the ability to take shots with bokeh and 3D effects. The second camera has a resolution of up to 5 MP. Unlike the 2016 ZTE Blade V7 Lite , which is roughly the same size, the ZTE Blade V8 Mini is not housed in a classy aluminum case, but rather one fashioned out of tough polycarbonate. A fingerprint scanner is located on the back. The user operates the ZTE Blade V8 Mini via a 5-inch display with HD resolution. ZTE overlays Google's Android 7.0 operating system with their MiFavor version 4.2 user interface. The octa-core processor clocks at 1.4 GHz.

As we examine the ZTE Blade V8 Mini in detail, we will compare it against the competing. Both Android smartphones are equipped with a 5-inch HD display, a 13 MP main camera, and 16 GB of internal storage, as well as similarly fast processors and 2 GB of RAM. The cheapest device in this trio is the Gigaset GS170, with an internet price of about 130 Euros (~$150; also not currently available on the US market). The Samsung Galaxy J3 can be obtained for a price of about 170 Euros (~$200; $150 in the US). At a market cost of around 160 Euros (~$190, not yet available in the US), the ZTE Blade V8 Mini's price point lies in the middle.. Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 Qualcomm Adreno 505.

The on/off and volume buttons are located prominently on the right side of the ZTE Blade V8 Mini's case. The 2800 mAh battery is permanently installed in the unibody case.. The fingerprint scanner is found on the back of the ZTE Blade V8 Mini. In terms of its position, this is not optimal, given that it is located outside of the user's field of view. The ZTE Blade V8 Mini is available in black, silver, gold, pink and red â but the surface of the back of the device is extremely prone to fingerprints. ZTE has not protected the Blade V8 Mini against dirt and water, but its manufacturing quality is good â especially for this price bracket.. At 143.5 x 70 x 8.9 mm (5.65 x 2.76 x 0.35 inches), the ZTE Blade V8 Mini is attractively compact. This size is ideal for sticking the smartphone in a jeans pocket.

Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 (SD435), a lower mid-range SoC for Android smartphones and tablets. Unlike the Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 , this chip is still produced using the 28 nm process technology, but it likewise offers an ARM Cortex A53 octa-core processor unit. However, this processor only reaches clock speeds of up to 1.4 GHz. The integrated X9 LTE modem supports category 7 LTE and thus a maximum download speed of 300 MBit/s and upload speed of 100 MBit/s.. graphics card is integrated with support for Vulkan and OpenGL ES 3.1. WLAN 802.11ac and Bluetooth version 4.1 are also supported. The memory controller supports LPDDR3 at 800 MHz.. The ZTE Blade V8 Mini's flexibility is also praiseworthy. Inserting two nano SIM cards into the unibody case's sturdy card slot transforms the device into a dual SIM smartphone. Those who need only one SIM card can choose to stick in a microSDHC or microSDXC memory card. The ZTE Blade V8 Mini's internal storage amounts to 16 GB, as is typical of devices in this price range.. The micro USB 2.0 connection is located on the bottom edge of the ZTE Blade V8 Mini. It serves exclusively to charge the device and transfer data. Above the display and to the right lies an LED light for notifications.. Android 7.0 (Nougat) serves as the ZTE Blade V8 Mini's operating system. ZTE has yet to disclose when (or whether) the smartphone's OS might be updated to Android 8.0. ZTE has overlaid the Android operating system with the current version (4.2) of their MiFavor user interface. Unfortunately, this means that all apps must be stored on the home screen â but the user can create folders to establish a sense of order.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

The WLAN module integrated into the ZTE Blade V8 Mini supports the IEEE 802.11 b/g/n standards. and transmits only on the 2.4 GHz band. At 51.9 MBit/s, the transfer speed to our Linksys EA 8500 reference router is on par with the competition. In direct proximity to the router (O2 HomeBox 2), the attenuation of just under -33 dBm is comparably low.. The ZTE Blade V8 Mini can surf the internet via LTE with both nano SIM cards. It goes without saying that it also supports GSM and UMTS. Bluetooth version 4.1 is on board as well. An NFC chip is seldom present in this price bracket â the ZTE Blade V8 Mini is no exception here.. Networking iperf3 Client (receive) TCP 1 m 4M x10 Nokia 5 Adreno 505, 430, 16 GB eMMC Flash.

The ZTE Blade V8 Mini's mobile positioning via GPS is satisfactory. Even indoors the Android smartphone did not have any trouble positioning the user, but the GPS sensor's accuracy is mediocre overall.. Our editorial staff also assessed the ZTE Blade V8 Mini on an 8.7 km (~5.4 mi) long test route, comparing its results to those of the Garmin Edge 500 bicycle navigation system. In the end, the recorded distance traveled differed by a negligible 30 meters (~98 ft).. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

As an Android smartphone, the ZTE Blade V8 Mini uses the familiar Google telephone app, in which the user can save Favorites and log calls. Unfortunately, the keys on the virtual number pad lack borders, but their size enables the user to hit them accurately.. The ZTE Blade V8 Mini's speech quality indoors is acceptable, though the smartphone's telephone function makes a better impression outdoors. Sadly, the speakers are a little weak and thus diminish the call quality in speaker mode.. A highlight of the ZTE Blade V8 Mini is undoubtedly the dual camera on the back, which comprises a 13 MP autofocus camera and a fixed-focus camera with a resolution of two MP. A photo taken with the ZTE Blade V8 Mini's dual camera has the necessary information to become a virtual 3D shot, but the bokeh function is even more interesting. It allows the user to change the focus and the aperture after the photo is taken.. Unfortunately, this function is not yet fully developed â when the focus is fixed on narrow objects, but the aperture is changed from f/1.0 to f/8.0 (as in our photo below), the whole image becomes blurry. In addition, the ZTE Blade V8 Mini takes a relatively long time to convert the photo. Shots taken with the 13 MP autofocus main camera are sometimes underexposed in diffuse lighting situations, but the pictures look fine when taken in daylight.. The ZTE Blade V8 Mini's second camera is significantly inferior to the main camera. Its maximum resolution is only five MP, and the image borders are unmistakably blurry. On the other hand, the camera has a built-in flash â a rarity in this price category.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image.

This procedure simulates photographing scenes that are often challenging for lenses to capture accurately, such as fine lines or text in front of a colorful background. And indeed, in our assessment the ZTE Blade V8 Mini's lens does not do particularly well. Text in front of a red background is a little blurry, the borders of the lines exhibit color fringing, and the image looks unevenly illuminated. Colors are somewhat oversaturated in images captured with the ZTE Blade V8 Mini.. The usual accessories accompany the ZTE Blade V8 Mini in its box: a short guide, a data transfer/charging cable, a plug adapter, and a stereo headset. ZTE also includes a little metal clasp to open the card slot on the side of the case. The warranty period is 24 months (in accordance with EU law â not applicable for devices purchased in the US).. The ZTE Blade V8 Mini is operated via the usual three capacitive buttons below the display, which unfortunately do not light up on contact. The buttons are assigned the functions "Back", "Home" and "Multi-tasking". For text and numerical input, Google's familiar on-screen keyboard stands at the ready.. The ZTE Blade V8 Mini's display reacts with sufficient sensitivity to pressure. In terms of its ability to interpret input accurately, we find no fault with the device.. Unfortunately, the ZTE Blade V8 Mini's 5-inch display offers nothing more than HD resolution, while other smartphones in this price bracket â such as the. â are equipped with a Full HD display. In normal use, this is not an issue, but it is noticeable when playing games. It is also a shame that the automatic brightness regulation often sets the brightness level too high. If the ZTE Blade V8 Mini is running out of juice, it would be better to adjust the brightness manually.. 388 cd/m² 412 cd/m² 396 cd/m² 396 cd/m² 413 cd/m² 399 cd/m² 398 cd/m² 415 cd/m² 409 cd/m². 93 % Center on Battery: 413. cd/m²) ΔE Color 6 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 8 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.31.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM detected 2273 Hz 3. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. The display backlight flickers at 2273. Hz (Likely utilizing PWM) Flickering detected at a brightness setting of 3. There should be no flickering or PWM above this brightness setting.. Hz is quite high, so most users sensitive to PWM should not notice any flickering.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. We measured the maximum brightness at 385 cd/mÂ², which is not particularly high. With the adaptive ambient light sensor activated to control the display brightness, the display reaches 418 cd/mÂ². The APL50 test (Average Picture Level), which simulates everyday conditions with evenly distributed light and dark areas, reports an almost identical maximum brightness level of 412 cd/mÂ² in the middle of the screen, with a black value of 0.43 cd/mÂ².. In comparison with other devices, the IPS panel's colors appear dull in everyday use. However, the ZTE Blade V8 Mini's contrast ratio is reasonable for a device in this price category. The display's results in the CalMAN sRGB color space coverage tests were not too bad either. The average DeltaE color and grayscale deviations compared to the sRGB color space are acceptable for a device in this price range, as is the color temperature..

This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Thanks to IPS technology, the screen content on the ZTE Blade V8 Mini's liquid crystal display looks stable from nearly every angle. Even from flat viewing angles, the colors of the screen content are not distorted â although the display does look somewhat darker. Despite the fact that the LED backlight's maximum brightness is not particularly high, the ZTE Blade V8 Mini does reasonably well in bright ambient light. The screen content is always readable.. The processor is the clearest indicator that the ZTE Blade V8 Mini is a lower mid-range smartphone. At a clock speed of 1.4 GHz, the. (SD435) is one of today's more feeble processors. graphics card decidedly belongs in the price bracket between 150 and 200 Euros (~$175 to ~$225)..

As a result, it was to be expected that current games from the Android Play Store â for example â Dream League Soccer 2017 â â would stutter occasionally when running on the ZTE Blade V8 Mini's GPU. But less demanding games such as â Angry Birds 2 â are no problem for the ZTE Blade V8 Mini.. The Android smartphone does not have a problem with overheating in daily use. After at least an hour in the stress test (both CPU and GPU under maximum load with the Stability Test app), the ZTE Blade V8 Mini reached a maximum of 36.3 Â°C (~97.3 Â°F) on the top of the device.

The ZTE Blade V8 Mini has one speaker on the back of the case, and another on the front above the display. The maximum volume of 84.4 dB(A) is reasonably loud. We were less pleased with the sound quality, as the speakers sometimes produce a quiet rattling.. At 500 Hz to 7 kHz within the mid-to-high tone spectrum, the ZTE Blade V8 Mini's sound is hardly linear. Bass tones are barely detectable, and very high pitches above 8 kHz are also underrepresented.. When the ZTE Blade V8 Mini's standard headset is plugged in, the sound quality generated over the 3.5 mm jack will not blow anyone away â but it is acceptable for a device in this price range.

In Review: ZTE Blade V8 Mini. Test device courtesy of ZTE Germany.. The ZTE Blade V8 Mini offers a dual camera that functions reasonably well, although it has trouble converting bokeh shots. Its features include LTE, the option to use two SIM cards, and a reliable fingerprint scanner. It also has a sufficiently large battery and a tough polycarbonate case. At just 179 Euros (~$215, recommended retail price; not yet available in the US), the price is also attractive.. For just 179 Euros (~$215, recommended retail price), the ZTE Blade V8 Mini offers a good range of features and even a dual camera. On the other hand, the processor is not particularly fast â as is generally the case with devices in this price bracket.. Buyers will have to make a compromise when it comes to the processor, especially in terms of the device's gaming capabilities. The 5-inch display unfortunately offers only HD resolution, and the automatic brightness regulation sometimes sets the brightness too high. In terms of reception and call quality, the ZTE Blade V8 Mini's performance is perhaps a little weak for indoor connections â outdoors it does not have any trouble..

What is a hands on review?. The ZTE Blade V8 Lite is true to its name, offering a smartphone that's light on powerful specs but provides a more than adequately bright 1080p display. It's going to be affordable when it launches in Italy, Germany and Spain, and it's aiming to rival the Moto G5 with its budget-friendly features and design.. Design and display ZTE Blade V8 Lite specs Early verdict. The ZTE Blade V8 Lite has a very fitting name, as it's lighter on some specs and being touted as a smartphone for the younger generation.. It's still packing some noteworthy specs and software. It runs Google's latest operating system, Android 7.0 Nougat , while some other phones are waiting for the big update.. It also has a Full HD display, giving you a bright, pixel-filled screen in a one-hand-friendly Android smartphone. It won't be an option in the US or UK, as least not initially, as it's destined for Spain, Italy and Germany from the outset.. You're also going to want to look elsewhere – like at the ZTE Blade V8 Pro or the ZTE Blade V8 Mini – if you want a stronger dual-lens camera or more powerful processor. But this phone should attract casual smartphone buyers who want the basics.. The ZTE Blade V8 Lite feels pricier than it likely will be, with a one-hand-friendly design that measures 143 x 71 x 8mm.. Its plastic build looks and feels solid, and it comes with a fingerprint sensor pad on the back – budget phones are increasingly getting what were flagship features in more expensive handsets just a few years ago.. What's really impressive is the 5-inch display. It's 1080p and bright, an always important trait when looking at a smartphone outdoors in sunlight.. The Full HD screen is highlighted by ZTE's great selection of wallpapers, and they're used to properly show off the high (for a budget phone) pixel count.. It's not going to be enough to support VR – you're going to have to upgrade to the ZTE Axon 7 for Google Daydream VR capabilities, but it's adequate for most everyday uses.. The rest of the specs focus on affordability, with a respectable Helio P10 MTK 6750 octa-core chipset made by Mediatek and 2GB of RAM.. There's 16GB of internal storage as well as a microSD slot if you need more. The cameras are a single 8MP lens on the back and 5MP front-facing snapper on the front.. You're going to get all-day battery life from the 2,500mAh capacity battery, according to ZTE – our final ZTE Blade V8 Lite review will determine that.. The ZTE Blade V8 Lite is the more lightweight version of the ZTE Blade V8 Pro. It gives you the basics and doesn't try to add a fancy camera or processor.. This is a smartphone for people who want to upgrade their calls and data to something a little more impressive than the cheapest phones out there. It can handle games – but maybe not the maybe intensive 3D games on the Google Play Store.. What's remarkable is that it gives you the new Android 7.0 Nougat update for what's expected to be a reasonable price when the ZTE Blade V8 Lite launches in Italy, Germany and Spain initially. And it doesn't cheap on the on the Full HD display if you're looking for a good-looking screen without paying a lot of money.. We'll see how this stacks up to our best cheap phones list, including the new Moto G5 , in a few weeks when it launches after MWC 2017..

ZTE Blade V8 Mini hands-on review. Nougat-y goodness without a high price. We are part of The Trust Project. Want a taste of Android Nougat, but don't have the cash to splash on a Google Pixel ? You're not short of options at this year's MWC.. Motorola used to be the best way to get the latest version of Google's mobile OS on the cheap, but the metal-clad G5 and G5 Plus aren't exactly cheap any more. Nokia is back on the scene, too, but let's be honest - we're more excited about its reimagined 3310 brick phone .. That leaves ZTE flying the flag for inexpensive phones shipping with Nougat out of the box. The V8 Mini is a new member of the Blade family, which means you should get plenty of change from £200 once it goes on sale, but you still get a metal body, decent enough performance, and even dual cameras.. Does that make it a bargain? Well, kinda, yeah.. ZTE Blade V8 Mini design & display. ZTE has been quietly churning out inexpensive phones made from metal for a while - just look at the Axon 7 Mini. The Blade sits a little lower down in the range, but you wouldn’t know it when you get the V8 Mini in your hand.. At 8.9mm thick and with an all-metal body, it feels pretty slick for such a cheap phone. Not quite on the same level as a OnePlus , but getting close.. That 5in screen is big enough to get the job done, without taking up your entire pocket, and even smaller hands should be ok, with no need to stretch to reach the top corners.. It’s only a 720p panel, which is kind of unsurprising for the cash. It doesn’t pack in as many pixels as more expensive rivals, with slightly fuzzy text when you get right up close to the screen, but it otherwise gets the job done.. Brightness was respectable, as were viewing angles. Entry-level phones don’t have to be saddled with naff displays any more, and ZTE has done a decent enough job here.. Around the back, you get a fingerprint sensor and a small bump where the camera module sits, but nothing that you'll notice when the phone's in a pocket.. It's microUSB on the bottom, not USB C, which is still par for the course in a sub-£200 phone. ZTE Blade V8 Mini performance and camera. A protruding camera isn’t all that common on a cheap phone - and neither is a dual-camera setup. ZTE’s just breaking all the rules with this one.. It’s a 13MP/2MP system, combining two shots to create a single photo. It won’t add a significant amount of detail, like Huawei’s P10 , and it won’t give you a wide angle view like the LG G6 , but it does do a pretty convincing bokeh.. Is it as good as the iPhone 7 Plus in Portrait Mode? Nah, probably not - but the effects did look pretty convincing on the MWC show floor. We won’t know for sure how well it works until we get a finished phone in for review.. ZTE does have one advantage over Apple, though: refocusing post-shot. Handy if you missed the moment because you were locked onto something else in the scene.. It felt speedy enough for an entry-level handset, thanks to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 435 and 2GB of RAM. 16GB of built-in storage is pretty good at this price, but you can always add more with a microSD card.. ZTE’s added a custom skin onto Android 7, which kind of takes the sheen off having a cheap phone running Android. It’s still as different and divisive as it was on Marshmallow, so Google purists aren’t going to have a good time, but at least lots of Nougat’s features make it across, like Doze mode 2.0.. That’ll help you get the most out of the 2800mAh battery, which is a pretty decent size, given the money. The 720p screen and entry-grade CPU should help that get you through an entire day of use.. The Blade V8 Mini isn't alone, either. It's arriving alongside the Blade V8 Lite, a slightly cheaper, slightly less powerful version.. For real pennty pinchers, the V8 Lite opts for a Mediatek CPU instead of a Qualcomm chip, and the battery drops from 2800mAh down to 2500. That dual camera setup dets dropped for a single 8MP sensor, too.. The screen, storage and design all stay the same, and I had a hard time picking the two apart from the front. You'll have to look closely to spot that the Lite doesn't actually have two lenses in its camera module.. It's only going on sale in Italy, Germany and Spain, though. Us Brits won't have to worry about getting our Lites and Minis mixed up and ending up with a duffer.. Dual cameras are a great concept, but it's tough to tell quite how well ZTE's cut-price cam will work compared to more expensive setups with many more megapixels.. Otherwise the Blade V8 Mini looks like a fairly tidy budget handset. Sure, it's got more than a few tweaks and changes, courtesy of a custom skin, but underneath you're getting Google's latest and greatest OS.. If you just can't wait to save a few more pennies for a flagship, this might be one of the least expensive ways to enjoy Nougat when it arrives in Europe later this year..

The ZTE Blade V8 Mini and V8 Lite are two budget devices for the youth. Storage; expandable via microSD (up to 2TB). 13MP + 2MP Rear Dual Cameras. Storage; expandable via microSD (up to 2TB). MWC 2017 is underway and we’ve seen a ton of announcements of new products that will be making their way to our hands sometime this year. ZTE is joining on the fun by announcing 2 new smartphones: the ZTE Blade V8 Lite and ZTE Blade V8 Mini.. Starting with the Blade V8 Mini, we’re looking at an all-metal design,. Powering the device is the Snapdragon 435 processor, along with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage.. The V8 Mini also features a 2,800mAh battery, but has been relegated to being charged via microUSB. With more and more devices, even the budget options, moving to USB Type-C , it’s a little questionable as to why ZTE made this decision.. The big focus for the Blade V8 Mini comes with the camera. ZTE has noticed the trend and usefulness of a dual-lens camera setup, and packed in a new set of sensors into its latest device.. The main shooter comes in at 13MP, while the secondary camera rates at just 2MP. However, the fun here comes in regards to the ability to shoot 3D photos. The software on the Blade V8 Mini combines the image taken by both camera sensors, then creates a unique 3D image.. a manual mode, as well as an auto HDR mode into the software.. Next up, ZTE has unveiled a device which is expected to be released at an even lower price point than the Blade V8 Mini. The ZTE Blade V8 Lite is being released with the intention of offering a competitive option for the younger crowd.. There are not many differences between the Blade V8 Mini and the Lite, however, instead of being powered by the Snapdragon 435, ZTE opted to use the MediaTek 6750 processor. The same 2GB/16GB option is available for the Mini, while still being able to expand your storage with the help of a microSD card.. Unsurprisingly, the Blade V8 Lite also. includes a microUSB charging port, which will refill your 2,500mAh battery once it has been depleted. Both devices will also include a 3D fingerprint sensor, which ZTE is claiming can unlock your device in 0.3 seconds. It’s also worth noting that the Blade V8 Mini and V8 Lite will also ship with Android Nougat in tow.. Pricing and availability information is scarce, however, ZTE has stated that the V8 Mini will launch in various markets including the Asia Pacific and Europe. Meanwhile the V8 Lite will launch in Italy, Spain, and Germany.. If these devices end up making their way to the States, would you consider picking one up for your little one, or are you going to let these devices pass you by? Let us know in the comments below..
