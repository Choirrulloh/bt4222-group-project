Editor Rating: 3.9 / 5. BLU Studio View XL is a low-end smartphone which has a large 5.7 inches screen with 18:9 aspect ratio. It sports 720 x 1440 pixels resolution, Android 7.0 (Nougat), Mediatek MT6580 Chipset, 1.3GHz quad core processor, Mali-400 GPU, 1GB RAM, 16GB Storage, 13MP rear camera, 5MP front snapper, and a 3000mAh lifelong battery.. 1 – 5.7 inch FullView Display (18:9). 2 – Cheap Price (Only $100). 1 – Poor Mediatek MT6580 SoC. 2 – Traditional Android 7.0 (Nougat). 3 – Not supported with 4G internet. BLU Studio View XL is made of plastic body which is bold and thicker. It is designed in such a way that the diagonal 5.7 inches of front occupied with 18:9 aspect ratio screen. A Sensor is used instead Home button. Camera lens, LED flash, notification LED and earpiece are equipped above the display. There is a Power Key and a pair of sound controllers on the left. The top and right side is clean. The bottom side is well equipped with USB port and two speaker grilles. The back side of Studio View XL is armed with primary optics lens, LED flash, and a fingerprint scanner.. The rear side body cover is removable. Inside this, there are dual SIM slots, microSD cards slit and a 3000mAh battery which promises you to give you a satisfactory talk time. Its battery provides up to 625 hours standby and up to 16 hours talk time on 3G. However, you can get 725 hours stand by and 26 hours talk time on 2G.. BLU Studio View XL comes with 5.7-inch Full Screen Display which is big and sharp but not perfect splendid for watching animations truly. There is 720 x 1440 pixels resolution which makes screen enough bright to see colorful pictures and movies. The color saturation is very fine. The Studio View XL runs Android OS v7.0 (Nougat) which has been launched since in 2016 and in the modern age of 2018 BLU is still using the traditional aggressive software technology instead latest Android 8.0 (Oreo).. The total smartphone performance purely depends upon chipset, processor and RAM Memory. There is a poor chipset of Mediatek (MT6580) inside the Studio View XL. Not only that, a slower speed 28nm quad core processor is also there which runs at 1.3GHz clock rate. So, it is worthless to say that the smartphone provides smooth performance for multi-tasking. But with the 1GB RAM Memory you can enjoy a little better performance. Mali 400 GPU enables you to amuse graphics. BLU Studio View XL packs in 16GB Storage to stock up images, videos and other media files. The given storage is not sufficient but you can expand it up to 64GB via microSD card.. The optics field is slightly improved. BLU Studio View XL has a 13MP rear camera lens (1.12µm size) of CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor). It can shoot 3120 x 4160 pixels images and full HD videos at 30fps. The low light performance is pretty good with the assist of LED flash. Camera interface includes more features and you can take advantages of Geo-tagging, touch focus, face/smile detection, HDR, Panorama, Scene mode, Continuous shooting, Digital Zoom, White Balance setting, ISO setting, Self timer, and Exposure compensation. Coming to the next, there is a 5MP front camera coupled with a dedicated LED flash. The front camera is featured with Face Beauty which offers you to capture your beautiful moments under the okay performance. It gives 1920 x 2560 pixels image resolution for your crisp, bright selfies. Our video calling experience is not too good with the Studio View XL.. BLU Studio View XL runs GSM and 3G HSPA networks but it does not support 4G LTE. With the 3G you can enjoy social media apps, browse websites and download media files but you can’t get faster downloads and online video streams in a better smooth way. The 4G LTE is the fastest network to keep in touch with the outside world but BLU has completely ignored its importance for the Studio View XL.. BLU Studio View XL is a featured smartphone which is prominent only for its Full Screen Display, Camera and Fingerprint Security for $100 but the other facts are aggressive like cheap Mediatek SoC, 4G absence and Old Android 7.0 (Nougat)..

These are being produced by an app called "Android Tools". This just recently started on my Life One X2, figured it had something to do with the recent update that got sent out but mainly wanted to find out how to stop it from happening.. Chad H :  I was able to get a screenshot of the advertisement notification. I don't see anything running in the background and I ran a scan with McAfee and Malware Bytes and both of them came up with nothing. I don't see Blu Rewards on my phone and I disabled the Blu help app a long time ago. There is something called W-BLU on my phone and I am not sure what that is. But I am really not seeing anything that should be causing this.. Chad H : + Larry Miller I uninstalled updates for that app and found out it recently went by a different name, Android Communication Sync. When I reran malwatebytes it popped hot but it is a system app and can't be removed. I also can't stop or disable it. Any ideas on how I can get rid of this BLU installed malware?.

This phone gets a lot right, with a solid design and build quality, decent performance, a clean software package, and an unbeatable price point. The camera experience is a bit of a let down, and the ads, if you go for the Prime version, can get annoying, but at this price, these are understandable compromises to make. If you are looking for a good option on a budget, the BLU R1 HD should definitely be considered.. Insanely cheap for what it does. This is the phone for when you break your real phone and need to fill the gap until you’re ready for a true upgrade.

Better still, this is the phone you don’t get, but use as a baseline for how inconceivably good and how cheap smartphones have gotten. The Blu R1 HD isn’t better than anything. A decent smartphone for as low a price as possible. The Blu R1 HD is certainly affordable, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bargain. The phone's design, display and battery life are satisfactory for a low-cost device, but its weak camera and inability to run graphically demanding apps serve as a constant reminder that this is a budget option..

BLU Studio XL2 - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 ». This phone really cool I can get a week from this phone. Since am not a heavy user. I have this phone my mom bought it for me cuz she cracked my my honor 5x/sense lte.its okay good for back up or for using for wifi calling or porn downloading or for YouTube battery good the screen touch sucks other than that decent phone. Anonymous, 12 Nov 2017 Here's the deal this phone is shit. Excuse my language but that is the only way to describe th... more The HTC evo 3D was a good phone. And, Sony Xperia Z2 is a good phone!&#128512;. :O , 14 Nov 2016 shut up BLU and take my money!!! lmao. I bought this phone to replace my Blu Studio 5.5. With this phone, I finally have a decent camera. It takes perfect pictures, and decent video. Mostly, the phone is fast and the RAM and ROM is MUCH better with this phone. I was concerned when replacing the Studio 5.5 that wouldn't be able to afford a larger size phone that does all that I would require, so it was a relief when I found this affordable phone, and really excited when I put the two phones side by side and saw how much bigger the XL2 is over the 5.5; and I was really pleased that the old phone was able to transmit my personal files to the new phone. I was NOT happy with all of the advertising, and how much advertising is connected to Apps via PLAY STORE. It's difficult to find apps that are free and do not have apps- it just takes a little effort to find the ones that are w/out. Pay for an app or 2 and no ads, is worth it. There are apps that remove advertising. I am still getting used to the differences in how this phone operates v. my last phone, but I am really loving this phone. What you get for the money is quite a lot. I do wish it had more than 16G but I had to get a phone right that second and only had X amount to spend at the time. But, I'm happy with this phone so far. At least I don't keep a lot of pictures or videos on the phone, so it should last long enough for my purposes.. Blu Disappointed, 15 Aug 2017 I've read several comments about the problems others are having. more I had the same problem with hearing volume, then I realized the problem was me. I wasn't used to a 6 inch phone so I wasnt holding the speaker exactly at my ear. Make sure you're holding the phone at your ear correctly. The top 30% of your ear should be visible when using. Here's the deal this phone is shit. Excuse my language but that is the only way to describe this phone. Extreme lag, crappy picture quality, Bluetooth problems, GPS locator extremely off and the list goes on and on. Let me save you all some time DON'T BUY THIS PHONE. Spend a extra $100 and go get yourself a legit brand phone from HTC, Apple, or Samsung. ac, 31 May 2017 android from 5 up on most phones don't let you transfer to SD card however there is an app Tot... more After I updated the phone from play store the problems.. Blu Disappointed, 15 Aug 2017 I've read several comments about the problems others are having. more The camera is up side down why how to fix it. Anonymous, 16 Aug 2017 the phone has problem with the following. does not allow to use your own... more Me have the same problem too. This phone does have a recent OTA patch that fixes the trojan and removes 4 bloatware games and apps. There will be no "root check error" on wireless update. Trojan in the "HTMLviewer" file that was non-removable is also repaired. OTA patch was dated 16 June 2017. Battery on phone really does live up to it's promises!. I've had phone for two weeks had nothin but troble seems to have a mind of its own,wish I never bought it. Anonymous, 16 Aug 2017 the phone has problem with the following. does not allow to use your own... more i have heard this phone has a installed trojan that cannot be uninstalled. So I've had this blu device for almost 2 weeks now, pro's great battery life I've hardly had to charge the phone and I'm a power user, whenever I play music on the phone it just laughs at me I could literally be playing music for days the most I've seen the battery drop while playing music is about 10% , secondly the screen is HUGE, 6 inches is nothing to laugh at ,though it's 720p and not very pixel dense you will see pixels but I wasnt enough to let me hate it (Movies are awesome on the device especially when you're on the go).My productivity has increased typing up docs is a breeze,video editing you name it, 2G ram doesn't seem like a lot now but it's more than adequate for light multitasking, Speakers are loud, very loud ,call quality is great as well. Also I don't have big hands and I don't really have a problem getting around the screen with 1 hand and I've never really felt like I was going to drop it , the best part about this is putting the phone in my skinny jeans ,sure that pocket is now only for the phone but at least I can take it with me and it only peeks out a bit. Look out for the next post about the cons I'll let you know what's up and tell me what you think.. I've had my BLU now for 3 months, and I couldn't be happier. Everything works like it's supposed to, and I've had none of the issues I see other reviews complaining about. I can hear everything perfectly loud and clear during calls, the Bluetooth is reliable, I can move my apps from SD card to sim and back, change my alert tones and alarm tones with ease, create ringtones from my music and so on. Im glad I picked this as my replacement phone. The only issue I've had with the phone is a lack of cases for it, and in looking at the big picture, lol if that's the only thing I ever find wrong with it, then I can deal with that.. the phone has problem with the following. does not allow to use your own music for alarms even if saved in music internal storage folder,. the software in general bad , does not allow for modification. i downloaded many external software to replace the phones software. I've read several comments about the problems others are having. Camera, sd card, music, speakers etc... The most annoying for me is the speakers. When a call comes in you can barely hear the person, and they can barely hear you! The position of the speaker on this phone is all wrong. I have an iPhone 7, and I bought the Blu for the 2 chip capability. Problem is it's very difficult to hear when talking to a person, and vise a versa. I've done the volume trick everyone else has done, and it barely helps. My neighbor loves the phone, but, she has the same problem when trying to talk with someone. You have to turn the phone over and talk and listen from the same speaker. There is no way you can hold it like a regular cell phone and just talk away. Why would a new phone don't want to turn on. Anonymous, 28 May 2017 This version of Android requires you setup SD cards as internal storage Why doesnt this phone transfer apps to SD cards. Why California State declared warning on this phone?.
