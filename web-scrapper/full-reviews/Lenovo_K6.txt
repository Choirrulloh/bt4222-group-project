Manuel Masiero ( translated by Bernie Pechlaner), 02/06/2017. Android Touchscreen Smartphone. Lenovo's K6 5-inch middle-class smartphone sells for less than 200 Euro (~$215), but its robust hardware features put it in a category normally reserved for much pricier competitors.. Â» Multimedia , Â» Gaming , Â» Lightweight Gaming Â» Budget Office , Â» Business , Â» Workstations Â» Subnotebooks , Â» Ultrabooks , Â» Convertibles. Top 10 under 300 Euros , Â». Best Notebooks for University Students Â». Top Windows alternatives to Apple's MacBook series Â». Â» Tablets , Â» Windows Tablets Â» Smartphones. For the original German review, see here .. Very decent hardware and a low price - Lenovo has compelling arguments to steer smartphone buyers towards their middle-class K6 smartphone. 199 Euro (~$215), but we've managed to find the smartphone for less than 180 Euro (~$195) elsewhere. For the given price point, the 5-inch smartphone has a lot of features: a Full-HD display, a 13 MP camera, dual-SIM functionality, Dolby Atmos stereo sound as well as a 3000 mAh battery. Also on board: a fingerprint reader, which is a rarity in this class. The phone is powered by a middle-class Qualcomm Snapdragon 430. SoC and comes equipped with 2 GB RAM, 16 GB of flash storage, and an integrated Qualcomm Adreno 505. The K6 ships with Android 6.0 Marshmallow - a fairly current version of the Google OS.. Lenovo offers two other K6 models, which are also equipped with a Snapdragon 430 SoC and features like LTE, dual-SIM, and a fingerprint reader. The K6 Power is almost identical to the review smartphone, save for its larger 4000 mAh battery. The other version - called K6 Note - is a little different, as it comes with a larger 5.5-inch display, up to 3 GB of RAM and up to 32 GB of flash storage. The main camera features a higher pixel count (16 MP) and at 4000 mAh, the battery is beefier as well.. For our review, we'll compare the K6 to similarly-equipped smartphones like the. Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) , and the Wiko U Feel Prime .. Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 (MSM8937) Qualcomm Adreno 505. Test device courtesy of Lenovo Deutschland.

Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. Although it might not appear that way at first - the surprisingly low weight of 140 g contributes to this impression as well - the smartphone features metal unibody design, which is available in. either dark-gray, gold, or silver (our review unit). Thanks to the rounded corners and edges, close-to-unnoticeable gaps and solidly integrated physical buttons, the case is impressive from both a design standpoint as well as haptic feedback is concerned. The metal chassis is very sturdy and the K6 resisted flexing even during our more vigorous twisting attempts without any creaking sounds. The display itself also remained completely unaffected.. At 8.2 mm, the phone is one of the slimmest ones in our comparison. and the Wiko U Feel Prime. is a smidgen thinner at 8.1 mm. The fingerprint reader in the middle on the back is slightly recessed, which makes it easy to locate by feel. The location of the Micro-USB port up top is slightly unusual and the bottom edge only contains the microphone. The location of the stereo speakers seems less convincing, as they are on the back, resulting in muffled sound when the smartphone is placed on a table. Thanks to the Dolby Atmos surround sound technology, it doesn't matter that both speakers are located on one side: when holding the K6 in landscape mode, the sound nonetheless seems to be coming from both sides.. The K6 comes equipped with 2 GB of RAM and the middle-class Qualcomm Snapdragon 430. SoC and is capable of very decent performance. The smartphone might not be speed demon, but it offers enough performance to run current applications. The same is true for the octo-core SoC integrated. Qualcomm Adreno 505 , although the GPU gets pushed to its limits much sooner when playing current games.. The flash storage drive has a capacity of 16 GB, but the Android OS and the preinstalled apps take up about 6.6 GB, so only 9.4 GB are available to the user. A microSD card (capacity up to 128 GB) can augment the storage, but that means that the smartphone won't support dual SIM cards any longer, as the K6 can either house two nano-SIM cards or one nano-SIM and one microSD card. USB-OTG is supported, so external storage devices can be connected if so desired. Right: volume rocker switch, power button. Compared to many other manufacturers, Lenovo decided to refrain from extensive OS modifications. Android 6.0 is almost completely standard aside from additional software titles. Fortunately, Lenovo didn't add too many additional applications. Included are third-party apps like Google's standard software (Gmail, Maps, YouTube, Drive, Photos, etc) and McAfee Mobile Security. Also part of the package are some of Leonovo's own apps like ShareIt (for sharing multimedia), SyncIt (backup and restore), and Theme Center (customization of the appearance). Aside from the Google apps, most titles can be uninstalled if they're not needed or the storage is running out.. The Lenovo K6 supports GSM and UMTS quadband and the bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 20, 38, 40 and 41, thus covering all important European LTE frequencies. Downloads are possible at up to 150 Mb/s, uploads at up to 50 Mb/s (LTE Cat.4). During our test, the connection quality was very good.. The smartphone is equipped with Bluetooth 4.1 and a 802.11b/g/n WLAN module, which means that only the 2.4 GHz band is supported. The WLAN speed is quite decent considering the technical limitations - we recorded about 52 MBit/s for both send and receive when connected to our. We should note though that smartphones offering 802.11ac support are up to 5-6 times faster. The Wiko U Feel Prime , which also only supports 2.4 GHz, is minimally faster than the review smartphone..

The GPS module was able to pinpoint our position with an accuracy of just a few meters, no matter if we stayed indoors or ventured outside. This positive first impression was hampered a bit when we conducted our bicycle test - but in this test, the smartphone has to compete with the professional navigation GPS Garmin Edge 500. The K6 shortens the traveled distance quite noticeably at times and - depending on the topography - claimed we took shortcuts through ground cover or front yards. These abnormalities weren't that common, however, so in the end we recorded a difference of about 380 m (0.24 miles). For normal application usage, the K6 is certainly accurate enough.. The overall voice quality is pretty decent. When we placed calls to other cellphones but also to landline phones, we could understand our conversation partner quite well, even though we noticed a little bit of background noise. When using the speakerphone, voices sound more muffled, but this doesn't affect communication at all. The only caveat: at maximum volume settings, the speakerphone can sound distorted. Leonovo uses Google's standard Android telephone application.. Photo - main camera (click for original). The main camera is equipped with an LED flash and supports a resolution of 13 MP. The focal length is 3.59 mm; the resulting pictures measure up to 4160 x 2340 pixels when an aspect ratio of 16:9 is selected; the maximum resolution of 4160 x 3120 is only available at a the 4:3 aspect ratio. Videos can be recorded in Full-HD with up to 30 frames per second. The webcam (focal length 3.15 mm) nominally supports 8 MP, but in "Ultra HD", photos only measure 3264 x 1836 pixels - so the effective size is 6 MP. For selfies, this resolution is still more than sufficient.. The camera menu is well structured and allows the user to select various modi like panorama, night mode, HDR, slow motion, and time lapse. Some camera parameters - like white balance and ISO sensitivity - can be adjusted as well. For selfies, the user can use fill light and snap the picture using the timer, tapping the screen, or via a gesture. A seven-step soft focus filter can be used to improve the results.. The K6 impresses with a decent dynamic range and a good amount of details even in darker areas. The colors are a tad too vivid, however, so some photos appear to be overly saturated. The result doesn't look bad at all, it's just not very realistic. Occasional photographers and selfie-enthusiasts are likely going to be satisfied with the two cameras.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. We've also checked the performance of the main camera under controlled lighting conditions. The captured photos have not been processed in any way. As mentioned early, the Lenovo K6 doesn't have a very soft touch when it comes to saturation, but it still quite frequently manages to reproduce the original colors quit3 accurately. Our test chart also makes it easy to check the sharpness. The K6 doesn't do well here: edges are frayed and diagonal elements suffer from quite. The lower half of each patch shows the original color.. Test picture (click to see the original). The K6 comes with a USB cable, a modular power adapter, a tool to open the SIM and microSD card slots, a quickstart guide, and a pamphlet with warranty information. Lenovo doesn't offer any special accessories on their website.. In Germany, the Lenovo K6 is protected against manufacturer defects for a period of 24 months.. The IPS display recognizes up to 10 fingers simultaneously. During the review period, the touchscreen translated our commands quickly and precisely. We also quite like the physical buttons. The fingerprint reader works reliably and the volume rocker switch as well as the power button provide clear feedback. Both buttons wiggle slightly, but the side-to-side movement is very minor and certainly not a deal breaker. Lenovo uses Google's virtual keyboard "Gboard", which supports swiping as well as voice commands.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

The 5-inch IPS display features a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and a pixel density of 441 ppi. Individual pixels are thus only visible when using a magnifying glass.. The display is evenly illuminated and - at 460.8 cd/mÂ² (white display background) - bright enough even for very bright environments. Adaptive brightness is turned on by default and ensures that the brightness is reduced automatically in darker environments. Even when switching to a more realistic test method with evenly distributed light and dark segments (APL50), we still measured 455 cd/mÂ² in the middle of the display. The black value of 0.38 cd/mÂ² results in a contrast ratio of 1237:1, which guarantees vivid colors.. 447 cd/m² 456 cd/m² 489 cd/m² 432 cd/m² 470 cd/m² 478 cd/m² 432 cd/m² 468 cd/m² 475 cd/m². 88 % Center on Battery: 470. cd/m²) ΔE Color 5.2 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 5.6 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 94% sRGB (Calman) Gamma: 2.24.

The display settings allow the user to select between two different modes. "Normal" is supposed to guarantee realistic colors, while "intensive" leads to more saturated colors. The difference between the two modes is quite visible.. Our analysis with a spectrophotometer and the CalMAN software shows that the K6 does pretty well in either mode: the DeltaE deviations of about 5 for both colors and grayscale only slightly exceeds the target value (DelataE < 3). Considering this is a smartphone display, we also deem the color temperature - which is a bit too high in "normal" mode at 7924K - as still acceptable. The "intensive" mode is somewhat better at 7510K, which is closer to ideal value of 6500K.. Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured..

This means that the measured response time is worse than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Since the display is quite bright, the K6 is very usable outdoors. As always, it's the reflective display which spoils the good performance a little, as it can make reading the display difficult at times.. Thanks to the IPS technology, the viewing angle stability is great. Even at very shallow angles, the display remains readable without getting noticeably darker in the process..

Thanks to 2 GB of RAM and the Qualcomm Adreno 505. GPU, the K6 has enough power to handle current apps and most games. During our review, the K6 reacted quickly to inputs and handled multiple apps at the same time without a hitch.. The Lenovo K6 does quite well when it comes to system performance and processing power when compared to similarly-equipped smartphones. AnTuTu v6 - Total Score (sort by value) Lenovo K6.

GPU performs well and even handles current Android games, although compromises are necessary at times. The very demanding Asphalt 8: Airborne , for example, didn't exceed 30 fps at any graphics setting. At maximum details and especially when there was lot of action on the race track, we encountered micro-stutters. We had no issues with the (also quite demanding). Dead Trigger 2 , which managed silky-smooth frame rates of 53 fps.. After our one-hour stress test, which utilizes both the CPU as well as the GPU to their respective maximums, we measured a temperature of only 35.8 Â°C. The average temperature on the front and back is only 33.5 Â°C, which means that the smartphone doesn't even feel warm to the touch. The internal components fare equally well, as we didn't encounter throttling at all. Even when we ran the GFXBench battery test - which renders a gaming sequence 30 times in a row - the K6's performance didn't fluctuate at all.. 34.5 °C 32.7 °C 34.2 °C. 34.1 °C 33 °C 35.8 °C. 33 °C 32.5 °C 34.7 °C.

Dolby's Atmos technology is one of the K6's most interesting features. The surround-sound system controls the two speakers on the back and does indeed produce a more voluminous and multi-layered sound compared to standard speakers. Of course, Dolby Atmos isn't a miracle cure for small speaker diaphragms. The highs are definitely still dominant; the mids are less noticeable and hearing the lows needs a bit of imagination. The Dolby Atmos app, which comes preinstalled, has different equalizer settings for movies, music, games, and voice. Users who want to tweak the sound themselves can modify the two user presets.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 28.2 27.4 28.2 25 25.6 27.9 25.6 31 24.1 25.2 24.1 40 25.7 28.7 25.7 50 24.7 26.4 24.7 63 23.6 22.9 23.6 80 24.6 23.6 24.6 100 25.2 24.3 25.2 125 34.3 25.1 34.3 160 40.3 19.7 40.3 200 47.8 18.6 47.8 250 50.5 19.7 50.5 315 52 19.9 52 400 49.9 18.9 49.9 500 49.8 18.9 49.8 630 54.8 19.8 54.8 800 63.2 20.8 63.2 1000 71.3 17.2 71.3 1250 72.6 17.1 72.6 1600 74.4 14.4 74.4 2000 73.4 13.9 73.4 2500 71.9 13.2 71.9 3150 70.2 12.9 70.2 4000 67.5 13 67.5 5000 68.4 12.8 68.4 6300 73.8 12.7 73.8 8000 75.7 12.7 75.7 10000 72.5 12.8 72.5 12500 69.1 12.8 69.1 16000 59.9 13.1 59.9 SPL 83.6 28 83.6 N 53.6 1 53.6 median 67.5 Lenovo K6 median 17.1 median 67.5 Delta 11.3 3.8 11.3 37.7 27.7 32.4 37.7 22.3 30.6 31.3 22.3 26.5 29.1 31.7 26.5 29 31.4 26 29 32.3 37.2 39.4 32.3 29 27.7 36.2 29 24.6 27.6 28.6 24.6 23.2 23.4 25.4 23.2 28.3 21.8 21.3 28.3 30.8 23.2 23.3 30.8 34.5 24 22.5 34.5 37.2 22.9 22.4 37.2 42.1 26.9 21.3 42.1 47.4 28.2 18.4 47.4 56.2 36.1 17.5 56.2 62.6 41.5 17.5 62.6 70.8 48.6 17.2 70.8 75.8 53.7 16.8 75.8 72.4 50.2 17.3 72.4 70.5 48.1 17.4 70.5 68.1 46.7 16.6 68.1 67.2 45.1 17.3 67.2 68.5 47.2 17.6 68.5 70.9 49.4 17.6 70.9 74.9 53.2 17.7 74.9 76.5 54.4 17.4 76.5 76.3 54.7 17.7 76.3 65.2 42.6 17.9 65.2 51.3 30.7 18.1 51.3 46.8 26.1 18.1 46.8 84.1 62.2 29.8 84.1 56.7 14.7 1.3 56.7 median 65.2 Samsung Galaxy J5 2016 median 42.6 median 17.7 median 65.2 13.9 11.2 1.6 13.9 31.6 49.5 25.4 41.3 25.3 37 32.9 35.4 33.6 44.8 31.6 41.3 28.4 33.1 27 30.1 20.8 29.8 22 34.3 21.3 34.7 20.8 42.4 21.2 48.1 19.4 52.3 19.5 57.6 17.7 64.2 17.9 68 17.8 71.8 17.3 71.1 17.4 70.4 16.7 69.9 17.2 70.1 18.2 73 17.9 76.5 17.6 79.8 17.7 76.8 17.8 70.9 17.9 66.7 18.1 62.5 18.2 49.6 30 85.5 1.3 59.1 median 17.9 Wiko U Feel Prime median 66.7 1.3 11.1 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Test model courtesy of Lenovo Germany.. The K6 is a very good middle-class smartphone which offers a lot of value for the money. The 5-inch smartphone features solid build quality and comes equipped with a Full-HD display, LTE, a good 13 MP camera, a fingerprint reader, and dual SIM slots. Dolby Atmos surround sound is also on board and while the K6 doesn't exactly sound like a portable concert hall, it still offers much better sound quality than the run-of-the-mill speakers integrated into most smartphones. Long battery life and the bright display with great viewing angle stability round out the positive attributes.. The Lenovo K6 features hardware normally only reserved for much higher-priced middle-class smartphones.. It shouldn't come at a surprise that a price under 200 Euro (~$215) necessitates at least some compromises as far as the feature set is concerned. Snapdragon 430 performs well, it's more moderate output means that there aren't a lot of reserves built in and the SoC will hit its limit sooner rather than later when it comes to future apps and games. 16 GB isn't a lot of storage, either and likely requires a microSD card for expansion - at least the supported size of up to 128 GB is generous. Unfortunately, expanding the storage this way erases one of the advantages, as dual-SIM functionality is provided by a hybrid dual-slot. The recorded WLAN speed at 50 MBit/s also isn't overly impressive, but still quick considering the technical limitations.. One word about the operating system: Android 6.0 Marshmallow is a pretty current version of the Google OS, but we don't know yet when and if a possible update to Android 7 is in the cards. There's no official announcement from Lenovo, so we have to rely on Internet rumors, which predict an Android update in the first or second quarter. Users who can't live without Android 7 on their smartphone might consider delaying their purchase a little.. Lenovo K6 - 2017-01-27 01/27/2017 v6 Manuel Masiero. Please share our article, every link counts!. > Notebook / Laptop Reviews and News > Reviews > Lenovo K6 Smartphone Review. Bernhard Pechlaner - Review Editor. Ended up in the IT sector in the 90s more or less accidentally and have remained in the industry (as a sysadmin) ever since. Always been interested in laptops - first purchase was - if memory serves correctly - a Toshiba Satellite T2115CS with DX4-75 processor, 4 MB of RAM and 350 MB hard disk drive (and Windows 3.1). To this day, laptops appeal to me - much to the chagrin of my wife, who doesnât seem understand why we need 5-10 of them at any given time ;-)..

LineageOS is a free, community built, aftermarket firmware distribution of Android 6, which is designed to increase performance and reliability over stock Android for your device. LineageOS is based on the Android Open Source Project with extra contributions from many people within the Android community. It can be used without any need to have any Google application installed. Linked below is a package that has come from another Android project that restore the Google parts. LineageOS does still include various hardware-specific code, which is also slowly being open-sourced anyway. All the source code for LineageOS is available in the LineageOS Github repo. And if you would like to contribute to LineageOS, please visit out Gerrit Code Review. DO NOT Report bugs if you're running a custom kernel or you installed Xposed. Grab a logcat right after the problem has occurred. (Please include at least a few pages of the log, not just the last few lines, unless you know what you're doing.). If the problem disappears after running "setenforce 0" from a root shell, grab /data/misc/audit/audit.log. Remember to provide as much info as possible. The more info you provide, the more likely that the bug will be solved. Please also do not report known issues. Follow Instructions Carefully otherwise you will get error :.

Quora User , Quality Assurance Analyst. Answered Feb 8, 2017 · Author has 170 answers and 93.4k answer views. United States: the FCC requires that phones sold have a SAR level at or below 1.6 watts per kilogram (W/kg) taken over the volume containing a mass of 1 gram of tissue that is absorbing the most signal. European Union: CENELEC specify SAR limits within the EU, following IEC standards. For mobile phones, and other such hand-held devices, the SAR limit is 2 W/kg averaged over the 10 g of tissue absorbing the most signal ( IEC 62209-1 ). India: switched from the EU limits to the US limits for mobile handsets in 2012. Unlike the US, India will not rely solely on SAR measurements provided by manufacturers; random compliance tests are done by a government-run Telecommunication Engineering Center (TEC) SAR Laboratory on handsets and 10% of towers.

SAR values are heavily dependent on the size of the averaging volume. Without information about the averaging volume used, comparisons between different measurements cannot be made.
