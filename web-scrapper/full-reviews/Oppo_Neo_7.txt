The front camera lens lacks LED flash, but the display can be used for the same purpose. The overall camera experience also gets enhanced with Oppo’s. Another cool feature is UltraHD, which shoots six photos consecutively and combines the best parts of each photo to make a 24-megapixel ultra high definition image.. The Neo 7 runs Oppo’s own. Color OS 2.1, which is based on Android 5.1 Lollipop.. Rounding out the specs is Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, LTE connectivity, dual-SIM support, and a 2,420mAh battery (unremovable)..

When it comes to tweaking, removing apps and fixing the flaws or getting it done the way you want could be as easy as 1 2 3, and rooting could do it for you. Rooting is technically a process of transforming any Android device into a more and better piece of tech you could ever imagine.. It ‘s an Android equivalent to jailbreaking. It ‘s basically a method of gaining root access from the inside of the operating system, getting admin rights, and break restrictions to enable further customizations. Once the device is rooted, it can be tweaked in any way you want and whatever it is that you want. A rooted device can have a boost in processor speed, OS updates, UI customization, remove bloatware, power up battery life, memory expansion, get additional features and a lot more.

Aminul Haque Tapadar, 31 Oct 2017 When Oppo neo 7 will get Android 6 Marshmallo update????. Please reply me??? Oppo neo 7. Can oppo neo 7 disconnects charger after full charge..?. My phone oppo neo 7 a1603 Not support 4G. When Oppo neo 7 will get Android 6 Marshmallo update????. Will dis phone work in dubai???. the keyboard doesn't come out when I want to text. Many other phones with the same prices are much better. every app restarts when I accidentally press the home button , so I cant play a game and switch to another app just for a while. Simpler way of saying , it's a piece of shit !. I have this phone for couple of year, it works fine w/ me. I do online games a lot. no question w/ battery its only 2+++ mah. Build Quality and handling of the phone is excellent. Its very light weight and easy to carry around. Screen size is good and screen is very bright and sharper than it seems on the paper. However performance wise this is a very bad phone. Frequently hangs, unable to handle many apps, very slow performance with GPS. So if you want to use it only for calling and SMS only then it can be considered, otherwise NO.. Does it have expiration or something? Thanks. Pages: 1 2 3 … 96 97 ».

Oppo A33f (Neo 7) Rating by MobileDokan. Oppo quickly won the heart of many in Bangladesh with its quality service and durability. Oppo Neo 7 is therefore a good consideration of low medium budget consumers. The big plus is that, Neo 7 has OTG connection. Also, 16 GB internal storage for saving a lot of media files and installing apps. On the other hand qHD resolution with TFT technology display could be better e.g HD IPS display. Other than that, quite a decent phone for the price.. User Rating: 2.29 ( 155 votes). Oppo A33f (Neo 7) Rating by MobileDokan.

I also experienced this freezes on my oppo neo 7, just making calls and preparing sms was really a pain in the butt for a quad core phone. so i did a system update but still freezes, so I rooted it and debloated it, I it was working smooth like butter but i may have deleted something by accident so i no longer get full screen on my phone during calls and can't install apps. I so i had my phone reprogrammed at oppo service center. I after that no more freezes even no root privileges.. In my experience, I haven't faced any hanging issues.
