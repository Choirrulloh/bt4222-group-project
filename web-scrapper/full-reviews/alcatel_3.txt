Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Digital image stabilization, Touch to focus, Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Effects. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Quad-core, 1300 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 17.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 18.8 days (450 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Android - Android + Alcatel - Alcatel +. Up until a few months ago, displays with 18:9 aspect ratio were reserved for high-end smartphones, but more recently we've noticed many companies including the new feature inside their mid-tier products. Now, Chinese company TCL raises the standard for budget-friendly smartphones by adding 18:9 displays to at least one of its devices. Alcatel 3C is one of the many phones that TCL plans to introduce in the next few months and, judging by the specs list, an inexpensive one. In fact, it looks like Alcatel 3C will sell in Europe for no more than €120 outright. The smartphone will be available in three colors: Metallic Black, Metallic Blue, and Metallic Gold. The main selling point, the 6-inch IPS display with 18:9 aspect ratio feature HD+ (1440 x 720 pixels) resolution. The rest of the phone 's specs are totally unimpressive but quite decent for an entry-level handset .. On the inside, Alcatel 3C packs a 1.3GHz quad-core MediaTek MT8321 processor, coupled with 1GB RAM and 16GB expandable storage. An 8-megapixel rear-camera is present as well, along with a secondary 5-megapixel camera in the front. Alcatel 3C feature dual-SIM support and runs Android Nougat right out of the box. Also, it's powered by a 3,000 mAh battery that should last up to 15 hours of talk time or up to 300 hours of standby time.. source: Winfuture.de ( translated ).

I don't give a damn about 18:9 display, flat UI, glass or metal... plastic is fine by me as long as it is sturdy and a reasonable pricetag for a reasonable device. 1000euros/dollars is WAY too much for a bloody phone.. no matter which logo is embedded at the back..

Hands-on: Alcatel reveals 2018 device lineup at CES 2018. by Matt Adams January 9, 2018. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Alcatel announced three lines of devices to provide compelling options for all budgets. All of the devices will feature the company’s new universal design language. The new design language is based on the 18:9 display aspect ratio.. Today at CES 2018 , Alcatel announced its brand new lineup of phones for 2018. The company says itâll sell phones in three distinct pricing tiers. But just because you pay less doesnât mean the device will suffer. The company developed a new universal design language to give customers compelling options no matter how much they have to spend.. The new design language centers around displays withÂ. The 18:9 trend took over the smartphones this year with everyone from Samsung, LG, and Google to smaller companies like Doogee and Gionee producing phones with the elongated aspect ratio. TCL , the company that designs and manufactures Alcatel devices, will provide the displays. TCL is a top-three LCD panel producer and claims the title of âfastest growing TV brand in America.â Using its displays provides âaccess to critical manufacturing efficiencies and billions of dollars in research and development.â. As we mentioned, they will come in three price ranges. The Alcatel 5 Series will be home to the companyâs budget flagship device. The 5 Series is designed to provide maximum performance, but retain a price point well under other flagship phones. This is a move that Alcatel has been pulling off for years with the Idol 3 and Idol 4S. Phones in the Alcatel 5 Series will feature premium materials, face unlocking, and a battery designed to last all day. While the company didnât confirm it here, earlier leaks Â. pointed to a single rear camera, a USB Type-C port, and a 3,000 mAh battery.. The Alcatel 3 Series will offer the companyâs mid-tier options. The 3 Series devices offer an 18:9 display, which the company describes as âlarge and high-resolution.â We donât know exactly how large or high-resolution Alcatel means, but there could be several options in the 3 Series if earlier reporting holds true. Alcatel also says that the 3 Series devices will feature dual-cameras and a beautiful design.. The Alcatel 1 Series will be the companyâs most affordable lineup of devices. The devices will feature unibody hardware and stylish designs. They are made of premium materials, but we donât know which materials those might be quite yet. Like both the 5 and 3 Series, devices in the 1 Series will feature face unlocking.. Weâre a little light on details, but Alcatel is only giving us a little taste right now. The company promises more details next month at Mobile World Congress. Until then, check out our other CES 2018 coverage!. Alcatel , CES 2018 , TCL. Please enter a valid email address.
