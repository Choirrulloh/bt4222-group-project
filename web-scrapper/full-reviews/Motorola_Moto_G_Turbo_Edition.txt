This phone was one of the first to introduce fast charging but I think the cheap price and the high specs take a huge toll on the battery as it heats up immensely. I bought this phone and it heated up so very often, my gaming experience on this.... I had this same problem with the Razr M. It is very important that you only use the exact wall charging power supply and not another power supply from another motorola phone, even if they both looked alike and said Motorola on them. Oh!

By Devraj Patel | 1 Apr 2016. if we use camera for document schaner this device creat problem. the image qualty is not viable but i can off flash image qualty is good it is viable. Moto is chines company they can not test the product before market launching. Was this review helpful? Yes No. By Bug Zee | 18 Dec 2015. Feedback after 2 days of usage:. 1>pure android experience- wow for a stock android experience this phone rocks, was able to enjoy NO preloaded apps and work through the day and browse with absolutely no lag.Performance wise too the phone is pretty good, the keyboard is kinda not that easy to use after using a previous samsung phone, but over all while typing long paragraphs and chat messages too the phone did not lag, so in a way it works out ok.Would probably install a third party keyboard app later sometime.. 2>Quick turbo charge- an almost essential feature for all smart phones, glad they packed a turbo charger with this set, MOTO X dosent have one, so another reason why this phone is better in that sense :). 3>dust and water resistant: 48 hours and the phone looks neat n clean, the screen is a bit of a mess with fingerprints but you can always wipe it off and not worry much.would recommend a scratch guard still.. 1>Battery life - well they loaded a 2470mAh battery for this one , sad sad sad, in todays world , a smart phone should have at least 3400 mAh in my honest opinion, but id say its ok as u can always TURBO charge it with ONLY THE WALL CHARGER, your data banks probably will not be able to turbo charge is what my guess is, still the phone lasts for 6-8 hours of heavy usage(1hr gaming 2-3hr talk time 1-2 hr browsing/songs) till now and 15-16 hours for light usage(15-30 min gaming, 1hr chat,1-2hr talktime). 2>Build quality: average build quality, defenitely woudnt stand apart in the crowd, not even when compared to the lesser priced models like Mi4i.Although the phone is dust and water resistant, you really dont feel the class when carring it arround.. 3>Camera: I am not a selfy fan, so it dosent bother me, but the camera isnt the greatest in X or turbo editions of MOTO, its a known fact i guess!!A deferentially no go for all the selfy fans i would say :P.The images i took had to be taken twice or thirce to make sure i got the right focus.Not keen on it so overlooked camera toatally, known evil for me:P. 4>Storage: out of the 16 gb , i could only see 11gb free to be used, and i was like no ways,thankfully theres a slot for expandable memries, so its a con i would say you can ignore again, yet 11 out of 16 is bull crap guys!!!. Verdict: you got a 15k phone that gives you a good android performance and a decent battery life for average users who want to use a 5 inch screen with average build quality.Major advantage is that you get a turbo charger- a must have for some one like me who is on the phone every 45 mins.Except for the battery life and the plactic looks, i would have rated it 4 1/2 stars, but since thats the major draw back in my eyes, i rate it a 3 for now..

Motorola Moto G Turbo Edition is the dust-and water resistant version of the Moto G3 with a better processor, faster charging speed, and a higher price. Obviously, when the Moto G Turbo was launched, a number of comments on our site asked: This one or the Moto G3 regular? After all, for many users, the price difference of Rs 1500 is quite a lot.. So, does the Motorola Moto G Turbo make the Moto G3 redundant? Also what has Motorola really changed with this smartphone? You might even ask, “Why didn’t they just launch the Moto G3 with these specs in the first place,” and frankly that’s a fair point to make.. We’ve been using the Moto G3 Turbo edition for sometime now, and here’s our review.. Specs: 5-inch 720p HD display | Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 Octa-core processor | Android 5.1.1 Lollipop | 2GB RAM/16GB storage (expandable to 32GB) | 13MP rear camera with dual tone LED flash and five megapixel front camera | 2,470 mAh battery | Dual SIM (Micro) | 4G LTE.. Watch Moto G Turbo Video Review. The Moto G Turbo Edition looks exactly like the Moto G3. The smartphone has the same matte-finish removable back cover with the camera unit in the centre and the M for Motorola in the back. The two Micro-SIM slots are on the rear of the phone, and there’s a microSD slot in the middle.. If you had both phones in your hand, you wouldn’t see a difference at all. We’re not sure if that’s a good thing, but obviously Motorola has decided to stick with this design for the G edition.. But Motorola has made changes under the hood. For starters, Moto G Turbo comes with IP67 certification, while Moto G (3rd gen) has IPX7 certification. Moto G Turbo can thus withstand both dust and water, while the regular one has only been tested for water resistance. If you want a more rugged phone, the Moto G Turbo is the better of the two. Do note that this does not mean that you can take either phone for a swim in the ocean. Salt water will probably ruin your smartphone.. Also read: Is Moto G (3rd Gen) really waterproof? Here’s what you can and can’t do. The only thing that’s really changed here apart from the dust resistance and fast-charging is the processor. Frankly, with Snapdragon 410, the Moto G3 was definitely on the more expensive side as far as current smartphone competition in the country goes.. The Turbo improves upon that with a faster Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor and 2GB RAM. The phone’s improved processor and more RAM means that this one works perfectly without any lag; be it playing HD games, switching between apps, the phone works gave me no issues.. Must see: Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) Express Review: Still the budget benchmark. The other strong feature about the Moto G Turbo is definitely the fast charging. In my case, it didn’t take more than an hour to get the phone fully-charged and even if you charge for a short-while, it will last a long time, usually the whole day. The phone’s battery is definitely reliable and should give you no reason to complain.. The cameras, both the front and the rear ones, work great if you are using the phone outdoors with ample lighting or even in a well-lit room. The rear camera has a tough time focussing, especially if you’re taking pictures at night. The focus keeps trying to readjust even for objects that are close by, which can be frustrating.. The pricing is what could really confuses me about this Moto G Turbo device. For starters, there’s nothing wrong with the regular Moto G3 as a smartphone, except for the entry-level processor for which Motorola still wants Rs 12,999.. Then there’s this Turbo Edition, which has the same design, same screen, but a better processor and is more rugged. Moto G Turbo, thus costs Rs 1500 more and is priced of Rs 14,499. You can’t help but ask, could Motorola have bumped up the specs more for this Moto G Turbo?. If you are bent on buying a mid-range Motorola phone, the Moto G Turbo makes much more sense than the Moto G3. Of course, if your budget is flexible and you’re okay with shelling out Rs 4000 more, then there’s higher-spec Moto X Play that is also available in the market. So the Moto G Turbo does come in an odd spot, given its price and that its specs are the same as the G3.. For the Moto G Turbo, the other solid competitor is the K3 Note, which has a bigger, full HD screen and cost Rs 9,999. If you’re looking for a smaller screen, and really can’t spend more than Rs 15,000, the Moto G Turbo is a no-brainer..

Please ask the question in above box. Is there any problems in this phone?. i have bought this phone 2 months before when it was delivered the memory slot was not working after 5 days. I called flipkart customer care and after following standard process i got the replacement for old one, the second one was again a box packed MOTO G TURBO but after using 12 days it again started showing the same problem (memory card slot not working). I called flipkart customer care they said now i need to go to service centre and get it done from there only as more than 10days has passed post delivery......... PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE OF FLIPKART AND PATHETIC SERVICE CENTR OF MOTOROLA............... This phone is good for this price range. Charging is slow when connected to other than moto charger given by the handset.. It takes reasonably more time to open some apps including gallary.. However, I suggests this phone considering overall features and value for money.. 1- Over heating- if I use internet, when it is on charge.. First of all it is a great phone in this price range but it has a problem of charging and this problem occurs after a year.. i already dropped in water n immediately cleaned no problem. What is the battery backup time of this phone?. It works for over one day on heavy usage of phone provided you don't play games a lot. Also with the turbo charger given with phone there comes no issue of backup as it fills nearly 70% in 30 minutes.. I usually charge my phone twice a day, if I am frequently using my phone. Otherwise, charging once in a day is sufficient. But below 20% charge battery drains very fast.. You will get a full day battery if you want more battery go for Moto G5plus or Moto E4.. Barely 24 hours even the manufacturer boasts of it.. I dont have many apps in my phone.. Lasts 12 hour and if you use it continously it may last for 3 hrs, if fully charges.. 4G means the fourth generation of data technology for cellular networks following 3G, the third generation. LTE stands for 'Long Term Evolution' and is short for a very technical process for high-speed data for phones and other mobile devices. Together, they make 4G LTE the fastest 4G service available today.. I think LTE stands for long-term evolution it's used for high speed technical data transfer for phone and some other devices.. 4G means the fourth generation of data technology for cellular network. LTE stands for Long Term Evolution.. In telecom, 4G means 4th generation.. What is the warranty period of this phone?. It is a nice phone but i have replaced it once within 10 days of delivery and the second one is also showing the same problem... i have to visit motorola service centres..........and service centres are pathetic... i have talked regarding them regarding their timing i got the answers as well but the manner in which i got was PATHETIC.........PHEW..... 1 year for handset and 6 months for accessories.. yes it does support JIO SIM.... it has got memory card slot pronblem... i had got changed my handset thrice and the problem remain same... yes it supports jio sim but in sim slot 1 only. Of course, I have used it for last year.. Yes, but only in first sim slot.. User Reviews of Motorola Moto G Turbo Edition. 12 Ratings 6 Reviews. 5 5. 4 3. 3 2. 2 0. 1 2.

Motorola Moto G Turbo Edition - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 … 79 80 ». This phone was one of the first to introduce fast charging but I think the cheap price and the high specs take a huge toll on the battery as it heats up immensely. I bought this phone and it heated up so very often, my gaming experience on this phone was terrible as it always got heated up and started lagging royally. Not to mention the absence of a compass sensor (as similar to all other Moto G series phones) due to which navigation was a headache on Google Maps. The screen quality and the handling were flawless though. The phone fit beautifully in my hand and the auto screen on made it a whole lot user friendly, but it made little difference because the performance of the phone was so under average. I'd suggest that you do not buy this phone or even consider buying it. You'd be a lot better off spending that money in buying a higher model of the Moto G series if you have a higher budget or a Red Mi to fit within the 12,000 price range.. ram verma, 03 Nov 2017 working properly until it starts hanging and get switch on & off continuously ,after 10 mo... more I had this same problem with the Razr M. It is very important that you only use the exact wall charging power supply and not another power supply from another motorola phone, even if they both looked alike and said Motorola on them.

Once I went back to using the wrong power supply again the phone was damaged and would not reboot again. The battery had just been replaced for $75 and that money went to waste..

Motorola’s new Moto G Turbo is a Flipkart exclusive with the. cashback for 100 customers till December 13, up to Rs 6,000 off for exchange on old smartphone and double data free for Airtel customers.. The Moto G Turbo Edition is the more rugged version of the earlier Moto G (2015 edition) that was launched in India and packs a faster Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor and 2GB RAM unlike the Snapdragon 410 processor in the earlier smartphone.. Moto G Turbo comes with IP67 certification which means it can be submerged into static water of up to 1 metre for half an hour without any worry of damage and is also dust-resistant. The Moto G (3rd gen) comes with IPX7, which means it has not been tested against dust resistance.. Once again, don’t assume that water-resistance means that you can take the phone for a swim in the sea, it won’t work and the salty sea water will probably ruin the device.. fast charging feature or what Motorola calls Turbo Charge, that we’ve seen with the Moto Turbo phones and the new Moto X series.. So what’s really different about the Moto G Turbo edition? Here’s our first impression of the phone based on our usage the last couple of days.. Design, Screen : Honestly, when you look at the new Moto G smartphone, there’s not much to differentiate it from the Moto G 3rd gen. The matte-finish removable back cover has the familiar design that we’ve seen in the Moto G. The camera is bang in the centre of the rear cover with the dual-LED flash below and the Motorola M logo.. The two SIM slots are on the rear of the phone, and there’s a MicroSD slot as well. Moto G Turbo Edition has 5-inch HD screen with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection. The screen gets covered in fingerprints quite easily, although I’ve not noticed any scratches and am using this without a screen guard. It is disappointing that Motorola didn’t go for a full HD display, since that would have been a strong differentiating factor between the regular Moto G and this one.. The Moto G Turbo edition’s screen, however, is sharp and vivid, even when you bring down the brightness to zero and thanks to the higher GPU Adreno 405, graphics heavy games like Beach Buggy or Asphalt look pretty good.. Performance, OS : The higher processor means that the Moto G Turbo Edition can handle games, multi-tasking quite easily. We’ve not faced any app crashes so far with this one and the phone’s clean UI and interface will appeal to the Android fans.. the Moto G Turbo Edition runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop and we’re hoping that the Android 6 update will roll out soon for this one as well.. Camera : Motorola Moto G Turbo Edition’s got the same 13 mp rear camera and 5 mp camera as the Moto G 3rd gen.. Motorola says the camera has zero shutter lag. Moto G Turbo does have a pretty fast clicker, although it faces some issues with focus, especially in low-light. You can tinker with the exposure and focus in the settings. However if you’re in a room with proper lighting, you can just start taking pictures and you will get some pretty good results.. Battery : The Moto G Turbo edition has the same battery 2470 mAh as the Moto G3, but Motorola has added the Turbo charging feature which offers six. hours of battery life with just 15 minutes of charge.. The phone took less than 40 minutes to get to a full charge for us and even with notifications buzzing on the phone, the battery level has not dropped below 60 per cent. Based on our early impressions, we would say the battery on this phone is pretty reliable and will last you more than a day with moderate to heavy usage.. The Moto G Turbo is a slightly higher-specs version of the Moto G3 with dust resistance and fast charging added in for good measure. The biggest positive is the faster processor and the battery life right now. If you don’t wish to spend more than Rs 15,000 on a phone, and think the Moto X Play is too expensive, then the Moto G Turbo makes much more sense..

Don't We Have Multiple User Facility In Moto G 3? If Yes, How Can We Access That?. Want To Buy A Android Phone With Good Battery, Camera And FHD Resolution. Smart Phone With Big Screen Good Camera Big Memory Storage But Not More Than 6000. I Am Planning To Buy Moto G. I Wanted To Know The Downside Of Buying This Device. What Is The Better Phone Than Moto G In That Price Range?. I Want To Buy A Phone Within 12000 INR, Please Suggest. Looking To Buy An Easy To Use Android Mobile Below 10000 For My Mother. Please Suggest Something From Samsung, Nokia Or Micromax. The Moto G is much better option than the K3 note.. mainly because k3 note has a much weaker chip and higher res screent his straisn the chip a lot more and phone heats up and under performs as a result.. Moto G also has better build quality water resitance and better camera.. you can find the links for prices and deals here :. but when i saw the reviews about moto g it is having cons rather than pros,suggest me with the amount of =13k which one is the best mobile to buy?. Im not sure what reviews you saw but every major review has only praises for Moto G ive tested one also and its eaisly the best device over all at this price range and gets updates also which no other device can gurantee.. you can find prices of all 3 generations of Moto G here :. Its there in Android settings u can add one when u pull down the notification bar also.. I had Moto G before this and that phone had this feature from the notifications bar. Not sure never used the feature. apart of android core so you can just check the settings under User :. 4G dual sim easy to handle good memory. Well there are no good phones with 4G and full HD resolution under 15k at least not the one's which translate to great real world performance.. you can go with Moto G 3rd Gen. Best in class battery life 4G dual sim and is easily the smoothest and fastest android phone in this price range since it runs stock android 5.1.1 and will get updated 6.0 marshmallow very quick,. it also has a reallygood camera since it has same camera hardware as the much costlier nexus 6 and it will be the best phone for you in real world usage.. Do moto g has a led notifier?. There is no LED notification but it does come with Moto Display which lights up the Screen in B/w and shows notifications in that.. how do u rate lenevo k3 or yureka plus? is it worth buying any of them?. Yu yureka plus is a really bad choice since it has way too much heating issues and reaches 50 degrees in just 10 to 15 mins of heavy usage.. is a good choice but the moto G GPU is better and although the K3 note has mostly better specs on paper the real world performance of Moto G is much better in UI smoothness speed and battery life as an added bonus its water resistant also.. So u r suggesting to buy moto g without any further consideration? how is the camera? better than nexus 5? as I have seen nexus 5 photos. Yes better than Nexus 5 since it uses the same camera module as the Nexus 6.. yes moto G might not seem the greatest on paper but its all considerable choices to make sure the end user experience is the best.. because mid range chips dont handle Full HD screens well and end up with lag and over heating issues.. Thank you Siddhy for ur advice.. I will now surely go for moto g.. any other feature u would like to mention here. Well it would get android M almost as fast as nexus devices.. its has some really useful gestures built in for launching camera and torch light which are useful for everyday usage.. Can u suggest any good samsung phone in this budget. Samsung devices are quite bad in this budget.. If you are buying samsung its s6 , 6 edge or note 4 and 5.. Everything else is bad because Samsung uses heavy skin on top of android called touchwiz and that manages to slow down even extremely powerful devices like s6 over time the mid range devices with much worse hardware will have worse results.. Updates also will be much slower than Moto because they have to skin the version of new android and then send it and priority will be for their flagship devices first always.. Suggest some branded smart phone other than motorola in the range below 15000. If 4G and dual sim are not a requirement the best possible phone you can get is Xiaomi Mi4. it comes with proper top end specs and build quality.. easily the best 13 mp camera in this price range.. 8 mp wide angle front camera.. 3080 mah battery for all day battery life.. 4g is required and I already have a mi4i.. Moto G is the best device in this price range with 4G and dual sim.. only factor which is not allowing me to go for it is its looks... Picture don't do it any justice i have tested the phone its one of the best looking and feeling devices in hand.. Moto g 3gen 8gb or 16 gb?. 16 GB only since it also comes with 2GB ram instead of the 1GB of 8 GB model.. Do I need a screen guard as Moto G has a gorilla glass. where from I can get the moto original back covers. yes screen guard is still a good choice, Gorilla glass 4 or 5 doesn't matter pocket lint or a grain of sand can scratch any screen.. try getting a Tempered glass screen protector its the best and you can get really good ones for as low as 200 rs online.. the smart phone with best camera and performance in this price range is Xiaomi Redmi 2 Prime. it comes with probably the best camera in this price range.. a large 4.7 inch HD screen and 2GB ram and snapdragon 410 cpu which is the same cpu in moto g which starts @ 12k.. its easily the best phone in this price range.. Moto G2 is quite out dated.. and yureka has lot of heating issues same price range you can get Lenovo K3 Note. I am an average Smartphone user. I usually use my smartphone for calling, browsing, Whatsapp and Mobile banking. I also respond to my emails on the go and would prefer to have good access to outlook tasks. After reading all the reviews i am going for the Moto G but before i do that i want to know about its downside of this device.. I moved from a Blackberry to Moto G. Typing is one thing that is a problem. The experience of using a qwerty keypad of blackberry just cannot be matched by anyone. The camera is decent - not great. Well, It lacks microSD card support. (16/8 GB internal storage variants are available). have a look: http://goo.gl/nYP2fU. I see people are crazy about Moto G, but I think in that price range one can get better phone than Moto G. I know about xolo Q2000, and I believe this one is better than Moto G. Hi Sudipta, The reason people are crazy after Moto G is the pricing and the features it carries for the price. Micromax was the only brand which had a dominant position in this price point. Xolo and Micromax have mediatek processors which are not the best chipsets for gaming and also start turning sluggish if you play graphic laden games. If your not a gaming buff i would suggest you to go for a Micromax Canvas Turbo which is an excellent device with crippled gaming ability. At that price range, Moto G is probably best. You can a bigger screen, better camera when you go above 20K range.. I need a phone within a fixed budget of 12000 INR, should have decent specifications and a pretty body.. Paul, Go for the Moto G from Motorola as this is the only globally branded handset in this range that boasts of a quad core Qualcomm processor along with solid build , Simple and sleek design and the 5MP camera along with a LED flash. Its surprising but no other contenders from Samsung, Nokia and LG are poised at this unique price point. The 8GB Moto G is currently retailing for 12.5k.. I am looking for a phone that is easy to use, and falls within 10000 INR. But would not like to have a phone that looks cheap.. Karan, why don't you stretch your budget a little and go for a Moto G because most of the Android phones below 10k have a cheap look attached to them. Moto G feels good and beckons to be held. Its easy to use as it has Android. Moto G 8Gb version is available for 12.5K and can be checked out here for availability- Moto G 8GB. More about Moto G Turbo Edition.

Moto G Turbo Price, Review and Specifications. Moto G Turbo tries to improve upon Moto G 3rd Generation, which devotedly focuses on experience rather than raw specifications. But frankly, in fiercely competitive lower mid-range market, Moto G 3rd Gen driven by Snapdragon 410 was a bit lackluster. Hence, Moto G Turbo debuts as a fix. With the Moto G Turbo, Motorola fits in Moto X Play horse-power in Moto G casing. Its the same Moto G 3rd gen from the outside,which means you get a vivid 5 Inch HD display, a much improved 13MP primary shooter, almost stock Android Lollipop with promised Marshmallow upgrade, modest 2470mAh battery and IP67 certified water and dust resistance. Add to it the grunt of Snapdragon 615 octa-core clocked at 1.5GHz with 2GB RAM and 16GB external storage, and Turbo charging. Thanks heaven a turbo charger is very much included in the box (unlike Moto X Play of course). So yeah, all that and Motorola branding makes it well suited to wrestle with other big, flashy boys in 10K-15K price range. The lowest price of Moto G Turbo Edition is 14,990 INR.

Tags :. Motorola - Motorola + Android - Android +. Tweets from Motorola India that were disseminated starting last weekend, indicate that the Motorola Moto G Turbo Edition will be launched in the country this Wednesday. The device supports the Motorola Turbo Power quick charging feature, which requires the use of a special adapter that comes with the phone out of the box. In Turbo mode, the Moto G Turbo Edition will charge the 2470mAh battery at speeds up to 75% faster. The Motorola Moto G Turbo Edition is equipped with a Gorilla Glass 3 protected 5-inch screen , carrying a 720 x 1280 HD resolution. The Snapdragon 615 chipset is under the hood, containing an octa-core CPU and the Adreno 405 GPU. 2GB of RAM is inside, along with 16GB of expandable storage. The 13MP rear-facing camera has an aperture of f/2.0, allowing you to take pictures even under low-light conditions. The 5MP front-facing camera snaps selfies, and handles video chats. With a IP67 certification, the Moto G Turbo Edition can be submerged in over 3 feet of water for as long as 30 minutes, and emerge unscathed. That is a major improvement over the typical protection to light rain and spills that Motorola provides some of its other handsets, through the use of nanocoating technology. The Motorola Moto G Turbo Edition will sell in India for the equivalent of $283 USD. The device has already been released in Mexico.

Jamshed Avari , 18 December 2015. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. When the newly resurgent Motorola made its mark in India early last year with the first-generation Moto G , it quickly became the go-to value option. Three generations later, and the situation isn't as clear. There are more options than ever thanks to the entry of a number of Chinese companies in quick succession. The Moto G has lost its spot as the sub-Rs. 15,000 top dog in terms of raw specifications, but its brand value makes buyers keep coming back.. In an effort to at least try to remain competitive, Motorola is now offering the Moto G Turbo Edition , a mid-cycle upgrade of the Moto G (Gen 3) ( Review ). Nearly everything is the same, except for the bumped up processor, RAM, and storage, plus the incorporation of Motorola's TurboPower feature as a result of the fast charging capabilities of the new Qualcomm SoC.. Not to be confused with the Moto Turbo ( Review | Pictures ), the new Moto G Turbo Edition slots in alongside the Moto G (Gen 3) at a higher price. We're curious to see how well this strategy will pay off for the company.. Look and feel There doesn't appear to be anything major differentiating the Moto G Turbo Edition from its elder sibling. The two measure and weigh exactly the same. Our Turbo Edition review sample had a black front and a very neat-looking grey-blue rear panel. The rear still has a rubbery finish that offers a solid grip, but now there's a slight swirl to the previously straight ribbed pattern. This is easily one of the most attractive and well-built phones in its price bracket.. The panel also comes into play in ensuring that the Moto G lives up to its IP67 certification. There are rubber inserts on the underside which form seals around the Micro-SIM and microSD slots. Every time you pull the panel off, you'll see an on-screen reminder to make sure that it's reattached properly.. Whereas the Moto G (Gen 3) was rated IPX7 for water resistance, the Turbo Edition also offers protection from dust as well. Both phones should survive after being submerged in fresh water up to three feet deep for up to 30 minutes, but that doesn't mean you should try to use either one underwater or deliberately expose them to such conditions.. The curved back is typical of Motorola's current style, and makes it easy to use this phone with one hand. It's on the heavier side, though, at 155g. There's a decorative indentation right below the camera which you'll find yourself fidgeting with all the time.. The earpiece and mic grilles on the front face are quite pronounced. They look like a pair of stereo loudspeakers, but only lower grille actually is one. The power button is placed comfortably on the right, and has a slight texture to help you find it. The volume rocker is right below. There's a secondary mic next to the 3.5mm audio socket on top, and a Micro-USB port for charging and data transfer.. The Moto G Turbo Edition supports quick charging - what it calls TurboPower. Motorola says you can get up to six hours of use with a 15-minute charge, assuming the phone is dead or nearly so. The charger that comes in the box is unusually large and can deliver up to 12V output, as opposed to the standard 5V. Our only problem with this is that it has a fixed USB cable, and there isn't a separate cable in the box so you'll have to find one of your own to plug this phone in anywhere else. Interestingly, Motorola's website and promo materials show a charger with a detachable USB cable.. Specifications and software Whereas the Moto G (Gen 3) is still available with either 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage or 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, the Moto Turbo has only one configuration which matches the latter. The SoC is now a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 with eight cores running at 1.5GHz - slightly lower than the stock 1.7GHz. Graphics are handled by the integrated Adreno 405 GPU. MicroSD cards of up to 32GB are supported for storage expansion.. The screen is a 5-inch panel with resolution of 720x1280, which is at the lower end of the range for this price bracket today. However, it's protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The rear camera has a 13-megapixel sensor with a dual-LED flash, and supports up to 1080p video capture. The one in front has a 5-megapixel sensor. LTE is supported on both SIMs, and you also get Wi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0.. One of Motorola's biggest draws has been the software experience and support that its phones guarantee. Just like its predecessors, the Moto G Turbo Edition comes with no major UI customisations of the stock Android experience. You get version 5.1.1 with an update to Android 6.0 Marshmallow widely expected in early 2016. There are of course a few tweaks - most notably the Moto Display feature which shows notifications when you pick the phone up or it detects motion. You can tap and swipe icons to see and respond to notifications you've missed.. There are also a few shortcuts: you can flick your wrist twice with the phone in standby to launch directly into the camera app, or shake sideways twice to turn on the torch. These are potentially useful, but with no warning or guide that they exist, users might inadvertently trigger these and not know how to stop them in the future.. There's an app called Migrate, which, as its name suggests, lets you import or export data from or to another phone. Contacts, messages, photos and videos will make it over depending on the make and model of the other phone in question. There's also an app simply called Moto which lets you control behaviour such as muting notifications at specific times, or within certain areas.. We didn't particularly care for the custom camera app which dispenses with a dedicated shutter button by default and instead makes you tap the screen. This can be changed if you dig through the options, and we did so because focus control was lost. There's one icon for the video mode and another to switch between the front and rear cameras, but other than that all modes and controls are in a ring menu which only appears when you swipe in from the left and has no labels or hints as to what each icon does.. Photo size is set to 9.7 megapixels with a 16:9 crop by default, which was annoying. Video starts recording as soon as you hit the video camera icon, which is a good thing. Video quality can be switched between 1080p and slow motion 720p.. Performance Motorola won't win any spec wars with a 720p screen at this price point, but it's good enough for most people. Viewing angles are good, but on the whole it's just a little dull compared to the competition. Sound, on the other hand, is loud and mostly clear. Games and video clips were a pleasure on this phone. We were also happy to note that it only got very slightly warm to the touch when stressed with games and movies.. Performance was generally smooth with no noticeable lags. We scored 35,086 points in Antutu 6.0 and 15,090 overall in Quadrant. Graphics scores were especially strong even accounting for the low-impact screen, with 24fps in GFXBench and 5,780 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme.. Photos taken outdoors in the daytime tended to come out with a very warm colour cast. We weren't too happy with the overall reproduction, even though sharpness was generally good. We did see some samples with focus and composition issues, which was why we eventually disabled the one-tap UI for good. Low-light shots came out well, for a phone in this price range. With enough ambient light, noise was manageable and objects stood out well.. Our video loop battery life test surprised us with an underwhelming score of 7 hours, 36 minutes which is considerably less time than the Moto G (Gen 3) lasted under the same conditions. It could be down to the hardware changes. However, with everyday use including a fair amount of 4G traffic, voice calls and time spent gaming, we had no complaints. The battery lasted through a day with a bit to spare. Quick Charging is something you'll really miss if you go back to a phone without it, but it's a pain to have to carry this phone's own charger around instead of using any commonly available Micro-USB charger.. Verdict Quite a few low-cost models have launched in India in the five months since the Moto G (Gen 3) was launched, including several with full-HD screens, 3GB of RAM, fingerprint sensors, and/ or other assorted features and specifications. Even Motorola's own parent company, Lenovo , sells the Vibe S1 ( Review | Pictures ) with a far superior feature set at just Rs. If Lenovo is indeed planning to axe its Vibe line to make room for Motorola , that will make for a very interesting set of tradeoffs.. We loved the Moto G (Gen 3) for the experience it provided, fully taking into consideration the fact that its raw specs were below par on paper. The new Moto G Turbo Edition is by far an improvement, but the bumped up hardware is not enough to catapult Motorola to the top of the heap - it's only enough to stay on somewhat the same level amidst the newer competition.. Weatherproofing and the stock Android experience remain strong reasons to choose Motorola, and quick charging is exactly the same kind of feature that adds value to ownership without necessarily reflecting in test scores. In cases like this, being unexciting isn't such a bad thing. The Moto G Turbo Edition is a safe and sensible choice, and you won't have any regrets unless you get a thrill out of showing off the latest and greatest hardware..

By Arvin Paculaba ( staff@latinpost.com ). First Posted: Nov 07, 2015 02:44 PM EST. Motorola has officially unveiled its Moto G Turbo Edition smartphone in Mexico. The new handset looks and feels like the third-generation Moto G from July 2015, but with higher-ended features.. According to TheGadgetsFreak , specs of the Moto G Turbo Edition include a five-inch 1080 x 1920 Full-HD display protected with Gorilla Glass 3 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 615 chipset.. This is a slight improvement from the third-generation Moto G's five-inch 720 x 1280 HD display and Snapdragon 410 SoC. The newer Snapdragon processor 615 contains an eight-core CPU plus the Adreno 405 GPU.. Memory-wise, the Moto G Turbo Edition is equipped with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of native storage expandable via micro-SD card slot. Although, it wasn't specified to what extent hard disk space can be expanded to. Basing from the third-generation Moto G, expansion should be around 32 to 64 GB.. The new handset has a 13-megapixel back camera with an aperture of f/2.0. Selfies and video chats are taken care of by a five-megapixel front facing unit.. "An f/2.0 lens means that that piece of glass is capable of an f/2.0 aperture. Generally this means that f/2.0 is that widest aperture the lens has. This type of lens lets a lot of light through and can be called a fast lens in the industry. Fast lenses are able to offer faster shutter speeds and can work in lower light," said professional photographer Brendan Smialowski on Quora .. A 2,470mAh battery keeps the light on for the Moto G Turbo Edition. This is probably where the device got its moniker. Similar to the third-generation Moto G, the device bears an IP67 certification. This basically means it is water-proof but only up to 3 feet of water and for as long as half an hour. Its durability trumps the nano-coating feature on recent Motorola offerings like the Droid Maxx 2 and Droid Turbo 2.. The Moto G Turbo Edition's connectivity options include 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0.. The new generation Bluetooth sends smaller bits of data and puts the connection in standby mode when handsets are not in use, per LaptopMag .. When two Bluetooth 4.0 devices are paired with each other, the two consume less battery life since the connection is automatically set in idle. Previous Bluetooth builds requires users to manually toggle off connectivity when devices are not used.. As for the price of the Moto G Turbo Edition, folks in Mexico can own the device for the equivalent of $283. Global availability of the new handset has yet to be confirmed..
