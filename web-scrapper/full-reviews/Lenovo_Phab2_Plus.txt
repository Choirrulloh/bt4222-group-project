This is the best phone i have used ever everything is damn good like screen size quality 6.4 its massive. Battery gives 1day backup if we used continusely internet or watchin.... i feel the phone is good,but battery is really sad,pls fix that issue. Phone has 3 worthy features: screen, fingerprint scanner and use of 128Gb SD card. Other than that it's a sucker. The original apps are way dumb. Of course you can download others, but originals always interfere dumbing them down.

Lenovo is one of the top smartphone sellers in India. and also claims to be the leader when it comes to the online market. While the company did have a great 2016, it is ending the year by launching its new Phab2 series in the country.. In my first impressions of the giant smartphone, I had suggested that the only smartphone that gives competition to the. Phab2 is the Xiaomi Mi Max. So here is a more in depth review of the Phab2 to see if it is better than its Chinese rival's. Build and Design: 7 / 10. Lenovo's smartphone division has grown up and has learned that build quality matters. Their budget offerings in K-series have all proved to be quite sturdy and well built. The Phab2 Plus gets a similar treatment. unibody on the back and glass on the front which slightly curves out around the edges, which is always a nice touch. It feels very solid and didn't show any sign of bending even when I. Now I won't say that the bezels and the area above and below the display are slim. But it is clearly visible that the company has tried. Using it with one hand is really difficult, even if you have large hands. I tried using it with one hand but almost every time my palm would touch the screen before my fingers. feels as if the finger taps are not registering. In short, you need to use two hands most of the time.. Other than that, I was quite satisfied with the overall design and build quality. Lenovo has also thrown in chamfered edges around the metal edges.. Phab2 Plus is a massive phone and despite Lenovo trying its best to minimise the footprint with thin bezels and no excess space above and below the display, it still requires two hands to operate. There is a one-handed mode but that only lets you shift the lockscreen's numeric PIN keypad and the dial pad to one corner for better reach, rather than shrinking the entire screen.. Diving into the other elements, the volume and power buttons are on the right which are a bit flat but feel solid. On the top is the 3.5mm audio jack, the SIM card/microSD card tray is on the left, and at the bottom is the microUSB port flanked by two grills, although only the right one actually has the speaker and is not a stereo setup. At the back is the dual-camera setup along with the dual LED flash and sensors. The whole camera assembly bulges out a bit so it can get scratched easily. Below that sits the fingerprint scanner which is easily accessible and works promptly.. The Phab2 Plus features a very similar package as the Mi Max. 6.4-inch Full HD IPS LCD display. clocked at 1.3GHz coupled with 3GB RAM and 32GB of internal storage. The storage is expandable and can accept cards of up to 256GB in capacity using the hybrid (micro-SIM/nano-SIM+microSD card) SIM slot. There is a fingerprint scanner as well as Dolby Atmos audio technology for enhanced sound experience.. The smartphone comes with a dual-camera setup where both offer. 13MP resolution with f/2.0 aperture, a dual tone LED flash, while on the front there is an 8MP camera with an f/2.2 aperture and an LED flash. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth v4.0, GPS/A-GPS, a microUSB port and FM Radio.. Running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the smartphone gets its juice from a 4,050mAh battery.. a large display means that it will gather a lot of attention. 6.4-inch IPS LCD panel with a Full HD resolution, which translates to. and honestly I think a 1080p resolution on a 7 or even a 10-inch display. is quite good, but that's just my belief. claims the large size makes it great for media consumption. But does it get it right?. Well I was satisfied with the brightness and the Phab2 Plus did fairly good under the sunlight. I didn't find any issues when looking at it from varied angles, there was no colour shift. Colour reproduction is great and even the touch response was in tune, well apart from the time when I used the handset with just one hand.. Lenovo offers an option to control the colour temperature and the saturation of the display under its settings. This enables you to have a cooler or warmer tone on the display as well as increase the saturation to make colours pop out.. Lenovo, unlike other Chinese smartphone makers, has trimmed down its Vibe UI over the years to make it more stock like. acquisition of Motorola, it has done so even more. This makes it one area where the experience on the Phab2 Plus differs. While Xiaomi offers a heavily customised MIUI 8, the Phab2 Plus runs on Android 6.0 Marshamallow which is all stock except for some custom icons, widgets and wallpapers. There isn't a lot of bloatware either. SyncIt and ShareIt are the only Lenovo apps, apart from which I saw Netflix pre-loaded for users who like to binge watch TV shows and movies.. It runs fairly smooth and didn't give me any major issues. I did however notice one bug. Every time I woke up the display while playing a song through a Bluetooth speaker, the music would skip for 2-3 seconds. Now I do listen to music via Bluetooth in my car and at home so that did spoil some of my experience. However it is a small issue and should be ironed out through a quick update.. I like stock Android, it's more convenient and I don't have to search for things as everything is where it should be. At the same time I like. The Phab2 Plus is powered by a. There is a Mali T720 GPU on board along with 3GB of RAM. This combination is good for day to day usage like watching videos, listening to music, checking mails, browsing, etc. Gaming seems to be good on the large screen although heavy games like Asphalt 8: Airborne did seem to struggle with a few frame drops. It also heats up when playing resource hogging games for. I also noticed that the handset heating up randomly when not in use. One of the instances was when I was using a Jio SIM for tethering.. As for raw synthetic benchmarks, the Phab2 Plus was disappointing. Almost all the benchmark tests resulted in numbers that were lower than most smartphones, including the Mi Max, in its price range. It scored 4347 in Ice Storm Extreme benchmark on 3D Mark and an unimpressive 4156 on the Work benchmark on PC Mark.. In terms of call performance and quality, everything is in check. Data and Wi-Fi works flawlessly, although I couldn't make VoLTE calls through a Reliance Jio SIM. Probably Lenovo hasn't activated the feature yet and would need a quick update.. Like its many phones, Lenovo has added. While the loudspeaker is nice and loud, it lacks a punch as it feels too sharp. Using earphones, you can feel the difference when using the Dolby Atmos settings. There are different environment settings that you can play with which is nice to have.. The Lenovo Phab2 Plus features a dual-13MP camera setup at the back along with. laser auto-focus, phase-detection auto-focus (PDAF), an f/2.0 aperture and a dual LED flash. According to the company the additional. At the front there is an 8MP camera with an f/2.2 aperture and a single LED flash.. The picture quality is average and using. HDR mode offered better contrast and saturation. Overall colours are a bit neutral and I noticed certain pictures turned out to be hazy. Focusing speeds are just okay and. pictures are taken quickly, although lag is noticeable time and again, specially with indoor and low light shots.. is fairly simple, you get all the usual modes like manual, panorama, selfie, night and so on. The dual-camera apparently helps you to get better depth in your pictures and thanks to refocusing you can select what you want in focus after the fact. It doesn't work very well and I think Lenovo needs to. Check the picture of the two leaves I've taken with the dual-camera mode in which I have used the refocusing feature. It just randomly de-focuses on the main subject.. Then there is the AR mode which superimposes characters like a cat or a dog to your picture. It is quite gimmicky and I didn't find any point having it. In fact a bunch of devices, especially Sony Xperia smartphones, have been coming with such a feature for years.. Both front and back cameras can shoot 1080p videos which are again just average.. I believe the company has a lot of work to do on the camera algorithms if they want to sell the smartphone with camera as one of the USPs.. The battery is rated at 4,050mAh. This makes it as big as what Xiaomi uses on the Redmi Note 3 while the Mi Max gets a 4,850mAh unit. A large screen phone deserves a long battery life, but the one on the Lenovo Phab2 Plus. I managed to get close to. a full day's charge while using it as my primary device. Heavy usage would finish the battery juice before my work day. The Work Battery life test benchmark on PC Mark test gave me 7 hours and 28 minutes which is nowhere close to the Mi Max which was close to 16 hours! The main culprit could be the less power efficient MediaTek chipset. This also means that it doesn't support any type of fast charging which is again disappointing.. The Phab2 Plus is a really good media-centric device at its price of Rs 14,999. chance to capitalise on the fact that there aren't a lot of devices of this form factor in the market. However, it cannot match the Mi Max due to a bunch of reasons. While it does get points for. build quality, software and even audio, there are a few things that Lenovo has missed here.. There isn't anything unique about its highly marketed AR feature. Sony has been doing it for years on its Xperia range. The picture quality is decent but not the best in class. Secondly, I wasn't satisfied with the overall performance of the smartphone, and. at this price Lenovo could've gone with. It heats up and struggles a bit when running heavy games. Because of the poor choice of processor, the battery life is just average and it doesn't. The Lenovo Phab2 Plus priced at Rs 14,999 and is currently available exclusively on Flipkart.. For the same price, the Mi Max is clearly a better device, if you can overlook the MIUI variant of Android. In areas such as battery life, overall performance, camera quality. The Lenovo Phab 2 Plus features a 6.4-inch FHD IPS display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and is powered by a 1.3GHz octa core processor and has 3GB of RAM. It comes with 32GB of inbuilt storage, expandable upto 128GB and has a 13.0-megapixel rear camera and 8.0-megapixel front camera. It comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow OS and support a 4050mAh battery capacity with 3G & 4G.. 173.9 x 88.3 x 9.6 mm. Published Date: Dec 12,2016 12:00 pm. | Updated Date: Dec 12, 2016 12:00 pm.

The Lenovo Phab 2 Plus is a phone for those demanding a screen as large as possible. Its 6.4-inch diagonal size makes it ideal for web browsing or watching video, as long as you don't mind the size and weight. In terms of hardware, the phone can't get us excited, but the $300 tag makes this a very reasonably priced offering.. Dimensions: 6.85 x 3.48 x 0.38 inches (173.89 x 88.3 x 9.6 mm). Weight: 7.69 oz (218 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Features: Fingerprint (touch), Touch sensitive control keys. Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels.

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Dual-camera (13-megapixel, F2.0 aperture), Autofocus (Laser, Phase detection). Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 1300 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 23.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 17.0 days (408 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Lenovo seems to continue its phablet line by releasing another. bunch of its second generation of Phab series, the Lenovo Phab2 Plus which is a tablet sized phone. Or I can say it’s a tablet with smartphone features, either way, this smartphone could be meant for those who wants a large tablet sized phone.. Lenovo Phab2 Plus is a 6.4-inch phone featuring dual cameras on the back. Here’s our Lenovo Phab2 Plus review.. The Lenovo PHAB 2, not a flagship from the Lenovo Phab lineup, but a midrange device priced at ₹14,999. A big plus point is its 6.4-inch display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. Hence, the phone is big to hold in one hand. It may not be comfortable due to its large display.. Talking about the design, it is made out of a solid metal shell and the front is covered with 2.5D curved glass. Build quality is flawless, it feels solid in the hands. Since it’s a large device to carry around (218 grams), you will need a bigger pocket to put in.. The 4,050 mAh battery isn’t removable due to its unibody design. The battery capacity may sound a little bit small considering that it has a huge display that draws the power. 4000 mAh nowadays is found on 5 and 5.5 inchers. Its main competitor is the Xiaomi Mi Max which is also priced the same and sized in the same category i.e. cameras are emerging, Lenovo also jumped on the dual cameras bandwagon featuring dual 13 MP cameras on the back with laser autofocus. This could be the cheapest smartphone with dual cameras as of now. Please note that its primary competitor Xiaomi Mi Max. is only having single camera setup, so this could be an edge for Phab2 Plus. On the flipside, it comes with an 8 MP front camera.. On the top, you have a 3.5 mm headphone jack and a microphone. Phab2 Plus is bundled with JBL Hybrid stereo headset. On the bottom, you can see two speaker grill, however, the left one is for microphone and the. It uses Micro USB instead of Type-C port.. The side metallic frames are strong. The right side has the power and volume buttons. Phab2 Plus has got a Hybrid SIM tray. It can hold one Micro SIM and one Nano SIM, both GSM. Otherwise, one Micro SIM and one MicroSD card for storage expansion. It comes with 32 GB onboard storage and can be expanded up to 256 GB. Lenovo Phab2 Plus supports 4G network and it is VoLTE-enabled.. The large 6.4-inch full HD IPS display can be easily differentiated from the competition. It has a black border all around the screen that takes some screen space. Its 6.4-inch is protected by a 2.5D curved Gorilla glass. Playing games is fun on the big screen, multimedia experience is amazing, it uses Dolby Atoms for a. The viewing angles are good but not great. As the display is reflective, you may not be able to read text clearly. The colors and text are crisp and good. Brightness levels are bright enough indoors, but due to the reflective screen, it may be a little bit problem while reading outdoors.. It’s stockish Android software doesn’t offer much options to tweak the display, you can choose the color temperature and saturation levels to customize the display quality.. The software on the Lenovo Phab2 Plus looks a lot like stock Android. It is based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and it’s slightly modified by Lenovo, but gives you the stock Android feel anyway. As you can see, I received a system update that fixed a few things in the software. It uses 5th October 2016 security patch after the update.. What you won’t see in the user interface is its the lack of app drawer on the homescreen as seen in the other Lenovo smartphones. This one has both homescreen as well as the App drawer alongside. no bloatware is found on the phone, everything is pretty neat.. On using the phablet in the landscape mode, it recognizes your hand, i.e. whether you swipe the notification bar from left hand or right hand. interface, things are mixed well in the software to give you a tablet-like experience.. The software also has a one-hand. mode, which further aids you when you use the phablet in one hand. Other shortcuts and gestures like double tap to wake wp, Smart Answer, Floating control, and others. The interface is similar to Lenovo Vibe P1 Turbo.. With its Dolby Atmos integration, it can deliver a one of the finest audio quality on a phone. A great audio experience will make your multimedia experience even better. You have four presets to choose from – Movie, Music, Game, and Voice.. The fingerprint scanner on the Phab2 Plus is on the back while the Vibe series uses on the home button. The scanner placement is fine, it fits my finger perfectly. Lenovo Phab2 Plus has one of the fastest fingerprint scanners I have seen. It supports a maximum of 5 fingerprints at a time. Just that it doesn’t support fingerprint gestures and doesn’t work with wet fingers, else this would have been the best fingerprint scanner for its price.. On the performance side, it is backed up with a MediaTek MT8783 SoC. It is powered by a 1.3 GHz octa-core Cortex-A53 processor along with ARM’s Mali-T720 graphics processing unit. The CPU performance is entry level but not even near to the Snapdragon 650 found on the Xiaomi’s Mi Max.. The CPU can be used for daily tasks but intensive tasks and multi-tasking can lead to slow down the device. The phablet interface has no lags, thanks to the stock Android. However, almost 50% of the RAM is used by the system itself and you get 1.5 GB RAM free.. We benchmarked with AnTuTu, Geekbench 4, and Quadrant. The numbers are below its main competitor, Xiaomi Mi Max. Snapdragon 650 on Mi Max is a midrange CPU beating the entry level octa-core MediaTek MT8783 CPU on Phab2 Plus.. As you saw the CPU is an entry level, the GPU is also weak for gaming. Expect to run games that require fewer GPU resources. Games like Angry Birds Friends, Trials Frontier, BADLAND2, Angry Birds Rio runs completely fine. Some high-end games like N.O.V.A 3 may struggle. Games Tested on Lenovo Phab2 Plus. The Lenovo Phab2 Plus is backed up with a 32 GB storage on board, plus it can be expanded with MicroSD. Around 24 GB free space is there for use.. We also benchmarked its storage, and here are the results.. Lenovo Phab2 Plus is the first smartphone in the Phab series to feature dual cameras. It is equipped with dual 13 MP f/2.0 cameras on the rear end with laser autofocus and dual-tone LED Flash. The camera lacks optical image stabilization and at this price, it is expected. The front has an 8 MP f/2.2 camera.. The camera interface supports a few camera modes only, Phab2 Plus has not many options to offer. It has a new mode called AR (Augmented Reality) similar to what I have seen in the Sony Xperia Z5 , it adds animated objects in the image to create augmented reality effects. The Dual camera is also used to refocus the object after it’s taken. More options on the interface are – HDR, Group Selfie, Panorama, and Night mode. No Slow motion, Time lapse, and OIS supported.. Camera quality from the Dual 13 MP is good but don’t expect anything better just because the phablet has dual cameras. with good balanced colors and details. The camera shutter isn’t quick at capturing photos. Focusing is another small issue, sometimes it isn’t accurate. The low light photos are weak. front camera, low light shots aren’t that well. But yeah, the front camera takes decent selfies in daylight.. Let’s talk about its dual camera features, it has AR (Augmented Reality) and Refocus. The AR mode takes shots with animated objects like cats, dogs, and others. It simulates the objects to interact with the real world. bed, the cat appears like sitting on the bed. Not as good as Sony’s but well. On the other hand, the Refocus is more like refocusing the object later after capturing the image. I have used it and somehow it is weird, it sometimes doesn’t work correctly or only if you managed to capture a proper photo. I have no issues with the depth of field. on Honor 8 and HUAWEI P9 , in fact, they are a great bunch to use. But, in the case of Lenovo, the Refocus doesn’t work well, not just that, the camera resolution is also reduced. I hope Lenovo could work on the software part to make it better.. With a large screen can play an important role in draining the battery life, Lenovo Phab2 Plus doesn’t drain too much battery on minimal use given that it has a 6.4-inch display. It sports a 4,050 mAh battery which can be average for its size and price but a larger battery would definitely be better.. web, social networking on Facebook and Instagram, as well as messaging, YouTube, and playing music occasionally can last a day easily. The battery can run through the day on mixed usage and a little bit more but long gaming hours and watching movies can drain the battery fast and the result is considered as average.. The screen is large and crisp, and multimedia experience is far better as compared to 5.5-inch IPS screens. Its Dolby Atoms gives you rich audio experience. What’s isn’t surprising is that the CPU can be a little bit weak especially if you perform heavy multitask. Better to go with Xiaomi Mi Max if you want to play better games and heavy intensive apps.. For its camera, the dual cameras can be a gimmick, or it can be more like Lenovo has just started out with dual cameras. The camera is overall fine but not to expect more from it. Lastly, the battery life isn’t appealing, which just runs a day on moderate use.. Taking all things into consideration, this phablet can be a real deal for you if you love a. large screen and the brand image. Wish to spend ₹15,000 on a phablet, look for Xiaomi Mi Max if you want raw power and better battery backup. Also, the software environment on Mi Max is user-friendly..

The Lenovo Phab 2 Plus is another variant of the Phab phablet. The phablet brings about few changes which also includes a fingerprint scanner at the back..

The Augmented reality mode on the Lenovo Phab2 Plus comes in the form of a special-effects mode, that allows you to add different objects and effects to photos and videos shot with the camera.

The phablet has 32GB of internal storage space which can further be expanded via a microSD card up to 128GB.. The Lenovo Phab 2 Plus flaunts a 6.4-inch Full HD display which is a tad better than the one on the Phab 2. Coupled with great viewing angles, the device reproduces vibrant colours and crisp images which can easily be viewed even under bright light.

Please ask the question in above box. What type of battery it has?. It has a 4050 mAh battery. It gets charged very fast, say a full charge takes about 40 minutes or so, but gets heated up during charging. But once plugged out, it is normal. Its standby time is more than a day of normal use. But if it is used online most of the time along with other applications, it can last for a day.. It has 4050mAh battery and gives average run time.. as well as good back up. Everything runs smooth, but takes more time to load than other mobiles like Redmi Note 4 and mobiles that have Snapdragon processor. I will suggest you take the mobile that comes with a Snapdragon processor. Games can be played only on medium graphics settings. Also not all high-resolution games are supported.. Is this phone good in functioning or is there any kind of discrepancy?. phone is not working properly and lenovo company also support...... à¤®à¥‡à¤‚à¤¨à¥‡ à¤«à¥‹à¤¨ à¤¦à¤¿à¤¸à¥‡à¤®à¥à¤¬à¥‡à¤° 2016 à¤®à¥‡ à¤²à¤¿à¤¯à¤¾ à¤¥à¤¾ à¤“à¤° à¤‰à¤¸ à¤«à¥‹à¤¨ à¤®à¥‡ à¤¸à¤®à¤¸à¥à¤¯à¤¾ à¤¹à¥ˆ à¤•à¤®à¥à¤ªà¤¨à¤¿ à¤­à¤¿ à¤¹à¥‡à¤²à¥à¤ª à¤¨à¤¹à¤¿ à¤•à¤° à¤°à¤¹à¤¿ à¤¹à¥ˆ........ Is it's worth for the money what we are paying?. processor is extremely slow....takes up a whole day just to boot.. does not let you save lengthy names. restarts now and then...does not ask you before shutting down. Buy only if you want a extra large screen. Yes, except for a very important fact that it does not have video calling option. So we have to use WhatsApp or any other app for video calling.. Between you are not paying that much, its only 15k, unlike other models with almost the same specs which sell at more than 25k.. What is the best in lenovo to have 4Gb ram?. I think probably lenovo vibe k5, lenovo Z2 Plus and lenovo P2 come with a 4gb ram. Of those, vibe K5 is a tried and tested model, which is heard to be quite good in the segment..

SAN FRANCISCO – June 9, 2016 : Lenovo (HKSE: 992) (ADR: LNVGY) today launched the much anticipated PHAB2 Pro – the world’s first Tango-enabled smartphone to enable augmented reality experiences – plus the dual-camera PHAB2 Plus and full-sized PHAB2 smartphones. PHAB2 Pro: World’s First Tango-Enabled AR Smartphone. Unlike any other phone, the PHAB2 Pro , powered by Tango technology – a set of sensors and software from Google that senses and maps its surroundings – makes a host of cutting-edge smartphone augmented reality (AR) experiences possible. For example, using AR apps, students can place true-to-scale virtual dinosaurs in their classrooms and enhance their learning through AR data overlays that appear while they walk around the creatures. AR gaming experiences let you play virtual dominos on your kitchen table, raise a digital pet in your bedroom and fight back swarms of aliens invading your house. With Tango technology the PHAB2 Pro can even begin to change the way people think about mapping indoor spaces to create new experiences like future augmented reality museum tours via the GuidiGO app. With Tango, the PHAB2 Pro offers unprecedented experiences on a smartphone that will continually learn and improve.. “Put simply, we wanted to take what was an amazing concept and transform it into a commercially viable mobile device,” said Jeff Meredith, vice president and general manager of Android and Chrome Computing, Lenovo. “From the moment we saw Tango, we knew it could become pervasive, just like GPS. However, to truly make the PHAB2 Pro a game-changer, we developed it at an affordable price for mainstream consumers, delivering not just a bleeding-edge phone, but an all-around fantastic phone that’s first to market.”. “Tango enables our devices to sense physical motion and space and, as a result, has the power to change how we interact with our surroundings. We believe that devices with positional tracking functionality will be pervasive and are happy that the PHAB2 Pro will introduces these new capabilities, making your phone even more useful,” said Johnny Lee, Engineering Director at Google. “Lenovo needed a highly robust and dependable platform for Tango and we are extremely pleased they chose the Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor for its advanced technology and comprehensive design,” said Alex Katouzian, senior vice president, product management, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. “The close collaboration between Lenovo, Google and Qualcomm Technologies allowed this new and innovative user experience to be implemented completely in software on the Snapdragon 652, allowing us to meet Lenovo’s aggressive deployment schedule without needing a separate co-processor or requiring hardware re-certification.”. Homeowners can also now use their PHAB2 Pro to remodel their homes by visualizing real home furnishings in their living rooms and kitchens. Home improvement company Lowe’s is one of the first partners to develop a Tango-enabled application, Lowe’s Vision. The app empowers customers by leveraging Tango technology to measure spaces and visualize how products like appliances and décor, or materials like countertops or backsplash tile will all look and fit together in a room. With Lowe’s Vision, customers will be able to control a new generation of augmented reality tools with a mere tap of the finger. “Tango technology will allow customers to see how their home improvement visions translate into reality like never before,” said Richard Maltsbarger, Lowe’s Chief Development Officer. “By bringing the PHAB2 Pro to Lowe’s, we want to empower customers with a tool to help them design, start and complete their home improvement projects with confidence.”. Three core technologies bring Tango experiences to life: motion tracking, depth perception and area learning. Through motion tracking, the PHAB2 Pro’s “eye” sees its own location in 3D. Area learning tells the smartphone its location. Depth perception lets the device analyze the shape of the world around it by detecting surfaces and obstacles. And now for the first time ever, your smartphone can visualize and understand its surrounding objects and environment via sensors that capture more than 250,000 measurements a second. While Tango makes the PHAB2 Pro unique, the device stands on its own as a premium smartphone. It is powered by the Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 652 processor, which brings efficient hardware integration and processing, leading 4G LTE connectivity, and cutting-edge time stamping and camera and sensor processing capabilities.. Demanding computer vision processing is performed by a single, integrated and highly efficient Snapdragon processor with a tightly integrated suite of key modules including a DSP, ISP and integrated sensor hub.. The Snapdragon heterogeneous computing platform is optimally balanced for a Tango workload and is designed for all-day use. The Snapdragon 652 processor also quickly processes and time stamps all the rich sensor data simultaneously received from multiple camera sensors, gyro and accelerometer, resulting in a fast, smooth augmented reality experience, where 3D AR graphic overlays track more naturally to the physical surroundings. The PHAB2 Pro features Dolby Audio TM Capture 5.1 with Dolby Atmos® playback capabilities to help capture life’s moments on video with great quality audio. With Dolby Audio Capture 5.1, you can use crystal-clear 5.1-channel surround sound to record and share the full panorama of your life, adding amazing richness, clarity and depth to your special moments. Making this possible are three microphones, spatial capture with noise reduction, along with an onboard 16mp camera that supports crisp video recording. Also, when you watch Dolby Atmos content over headphones, you’ll feel like you’re in the middle of the action on screen with immersive, moving audio. The 6.4-inch PHAB2 Pro boasts an intelligent Assertive Display with a pin-sharp QHD (2,560 x 1,440) resolution, capable of optimizing image quality based on ambient lighting and content. To find out more about Lenovo’s development of the PHAB2 Pro with Tango, please visit our newsroom at http://news.lenovo.com/TechWorld2016. Watch the livestream from Tech World here: www.YouTube.com/lenovo. Known for its photos, the PHAB2 Plus comes with two 13MP rear cameras that have instant focus, fast f2.0 lenses. Shutterbugs can capture amazing pictures with crisp low-light shots, high contrast while retaining lifelike colors, high detail in the shadow areas and a captivating background blur. Meanwhile, the camera software incorporates a manual mode as well as other special effects.. The PHAB2 offers an affordable AR smartphone with many of the attractive features found in higher-end models. PHAB2’s AR mode, for instance, allows you to create more unique photos and videos by superimposing effects such as virtual backgrounds or cartoons onto your pictures – perfect for sharing on Facebook or Instagram. Other highlights include a huge 6.4-inch HD display, complete with a fast-focusing 13MP camera and 32GB onboard storage expandable via a microSD slot. Pricing for the Lenovo PHAB2 will start at $199 (USD); Phab2 Plus will start at $299; and PHAB2 Pro will start at $499. All will be globally available beginning in September. In the US, the PHAB2 Pro will be sold at select Lowe’s stores nationwide and online by the end of the year. Pricing and availability may vary from country to country.
