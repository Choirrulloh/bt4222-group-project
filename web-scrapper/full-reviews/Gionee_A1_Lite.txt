Chinese phonemaker Gionee has come up with stripped down version of the big screen A1 Plus (Rs 26,999) which was launched in July. The new smartphone will be called the A1 Lite and it will cost Rs 14,999. It is likely to compete with the Xiaomi Mi A1, which is selling at the same price.. The smartphone has the same design language as the A1 Plus, but a smaller form factor.. The smartphone has the same design language as the A1 Plus, but a smaller form factor. The lustreless metal cover offers firm grip, even though the phone felt a little hefty for its size. It weighs 161g which is a bit on the higher side for a 5.3-inch screen smartphone. The Xiaomi Mi A1 weighs 165g, but offers a bigger 5.5-inch screen. At 7.3mm, it is thinner than the A1 Lite (8mm).. The speaker in the A1 Lite is placed at the back and the micro USB at the base. The finger print sensor is placed right below the back camera. Its circular shape falls in symmetry with the camera above and the Gionee Logo underneath. The fingerprint sensor is easily accessible, accurate to use, but a bit slow in terms of response. The navigation keys are placed outside the screen on the lower bezel, but they are not backlit.. Both smartphones look and feel good in hand. It is the subtle differences which gives the Mi A1 an upper hand. For example, its navigation keys are backlit, the speaker is placed at the base and it offers USB Type-C for faster charging.. The A1 Lite has a 5.3-inch screen with resolution of 1,280x720p.. The A1 Lite has a 5.3-inch screen with resolution of 1,280x720p. The Mi A1 offers a sharper and bigger 5.5-inch display with resolution of 1,920x1,080p. Gionee has tweaked the display well. Colours look rich, which makes watching movies still enjoyable. The A1 Lite also comes with the option of modifying colour temperature and switch between cool and warm colour.. Software: Custom UI with plenty to play with. The Gionee smartphone runs Android 7.0 (Nougat) with Gionee’s Amigo user interface (UI) on top. Gionee has tried to organise it more than a typical custom UI. For example, the drop-down notifications panel is kept separate from quick settings. The former shows at the top and the latter from the lower edge of the screen. Gionee has preloaded a lot of third-party apps and games. You can also apply new themes and wallpapers.. The Mi A1 runs Android 7.1.2 with the stock Android interface. It is an Android One smartphone and will receive all Google updates including the Android Oreo (8.1) before others. It also offers unlimited storage for high resolution photos on Google Drive.. Performance: Not as powerful as rival. To power the A1 Lite, Gionee has used Mediatek’s MT6753 octa-core processor which has a clock speed of 1.3GHz. It is paired with 3GB RAM. The smartphone was able to handle day-to-day apps without any snags. Switching between apps was smooth even with 8 to 10 apps running in the background. However, it is not cut out for heavy games as it is not as powerful as the Mi A1 which runs on 2.0GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 octa-core processor paired with 4GB RAM.. The A1 Lite offers 32GB internal storage, while with Mi A1 you get 64GB storage. Both have a micro SD slot in case you want to expand it further.. The A1 Lite packs in a 4,000mAh battery which lasts just about a day on a single charge. The Mi A1 has a smaller 3,000mAh battery but on account of the 14nm chipset and clean Android interface, it was able to deliver almost similar amount of battery backup.. A1 Lite’s camera is fast and locks focus quickly too.. Camera: Works well in most conditions. The A1 Lite offers a single 13-megapixel camera with aperture f/2.0 and phase detection auto focus. The camera is fast and locks focus quickly too. Picture quality looks impressive in daytime. Image looks crisp and colours brighter than shots taken with the Mi A1’s camera. In low-light shots, it automatically lights up darker areas, and the results look good but a little blurry. The Mi A1 offers a dual 12-megapixel cameras with aperture of f/2.2 and 2x optical zoom. The Mi A1 has an edge over the A1 Lite when it comes to detailing, especially in landscape shots.. What gives the A1 Lite an edge is the 20-megapixel front camera for selfie fans. It can capture more detail and colours look richer than the 5-megapixel front camera on the Mi A1.. Gionee A1 Lite’s charm lies in its premium looks, impressive front camera, and software customisation options which are very popular with mainstream users. In terms of overall value for money, the Xiaomi Mi A1 is a much better option. It has an uncluttered interface, will get all Google updates on time, is driven by a more powerful processor and has more RAM.. First Published: Fri, Sep 29 2017.

The Gionee A1 Lite is aimed at selfie lovers who desire a good battery life. A subdued performance during multitasking makes it an average performer.. Great selfies, a good battery life at moderate usage and a fluid UI make Gionee A1 Lite worthy of purchasing.. The A1 Lite is Chinese smartphone maker Gionee’s newest attempt to tap into the craze for selfies among youth and elders alike. And right at the outset, the Gionee A1 Lite justifies both the Rs 13,939 price tag and its primary objective – taking selfies.. The A1 Lite comes with a 5.3-inch display Corning Gorilla Glass 3 touchscreen at the front and a metal finish back cover at the rear. At 161 grams, the phone is surprisingly light even after housing a 4000 mAh battery. At the top of the phone is a front-camera, an earpiece and a sensor. The phone has a minimal bezel on the sides and at the bottom of the screen you will find physical navigation buttons. The volume rocker and the power buttons are placed on the right edge, while the left edge sports the dual-SIM tray.. The phone has a 5.3-inch IPS LCD screen with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels. Considering that many phones in the Rs 10,000-15,000 price range sport a Full-HD display, A1 Lite could have done with a 1080p display. Having said that, the display is quite bright when used outdoors with a very good colour reproduction.. Maruti Suzuki Swift's hybrid version could make its way to Indian roads. MWC 2018 Live: Lenovo adds Yoga 530 and 730 to its Yoga laptop series. Microsoft data warrant case in top US court has global implications. Videos and images projected on the screen are crisp and clear.. The phone features a 20MP camera with a soft flash at the front, the biggest highlight of the phone. On the back panel, the phone houses a 13MP sensor with an LED flash. At 20MP, A1 Lite is one of the very few phones in the market to house such a powerful camera sensor.. To begin with, not just the hardware but the phone hides a lot of features under its hood to artificially beautify all the pictures that you click. Among them features such as smoother, slimming and whitening are interesting and easy to use.. Most photos clicked with the selfie camera were smooth and crisp. The 20MP snapper can click some bright photos even indoors, given the selfie flash. The beautify mode is the icing on the cake.. A1 Lite’s 13MP rear camera, however, is a little disappointing for macro photos. This shouldn’t be a deal-breaker as the rear camera does a pretty good job outdoors, indoors and dimly-lit environments.. Gionee A1 Lite Specifications & Performance. Gionee A1 Lite is a mid-range budget phone where it competes with the likes of Xiaomi Note 4 or say a Moto G5 Plus. And to face this competition the company has powered the phone with a MediaTek MT6753 processor clocked at 1.3 GHz. The phone has a 3GB RAM and a 32GB internal storage, which can be further expanded up to 256GB. Powering the phone’s graphical requirements is a Mali T-720 GPU.. The phone runs like clockwork while making calls, watching videos, browsing the Internet, using common games, messaging, social media apps. A1 Lite does stutter when multi-tasking with heavy games such as Asphalt 8: Airborn or Sniper 3D assassin. Should you limit the number of apps running in the background, the A1 Lite is a good proposition. At best, the Gionee A1 Lite is an average performer when it comes to heavy-duty usage. Besides the phone heats a lot during multi-tasking.. Gionee A1 Lite comes with Android 7.0 Nougat, a plus point for a phone which is priced less than Rs 15,000. On top of this, the phone has its own Amigo OS 4.0 UI. Now, if anybody has ever seen a Gionee phone before they will know that Amigo UI appears much like Apple iOS. The home screen has a neatly-arranged grid. The notifications drawer can be accessed by simply swiping downwards and the quick settings menu appears with a swipe from the bottom.. The phone sports a 4000mAh battery, which the company claims will let you easily sail through more than a day amidst all the web browsing and 4G VoLTE calls. With a moderate amount of calls, watching videos, streaming music, browsing and running common apps, the phone can offer you a battery life of a little under 16 hours. Gionee may roll out some updates in the future which may prolong the battery life. At 14-16 hours, the battery life on the Gionee A1 Lite is more than satisfactory..

Author Dhruv Bhutani Posted on August 25, 2017 September 1, 2017 Categories Gionee , Reviews. pixels) HD 2.5D curved glass display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. 1.3GHz Octa-Core Mediatek MT6753 Processor with Mali T-720 GPU. 3GB RAM, 32GB Internal memory, expandable memory up to 256GB with micro SD. 13MP rear camera with LED flash. 20MP front-facing camera with soft LED selfie flash. 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, USB OTG. While Xiaomi, Lenovo and Moto dominate the headlines when it comes to mid range smartphones, the likes of Gionee too have been making significant inroads into the segment. While we weren’t particularly fond of some of the earlier launches by the brand, at first glance it appears that Gionee has been working hard to up its game. Does it succeed? We find out in our review of the Gionee A1 Lite.. The Gionee A1 Lite doesn’t stray too much from the design we’ve come to expect from mid range smartphones and that’s not really a bad thing either. Sure, it’s not the most unique looking phone out there but the company has done well on the build quality front.. The Gionee A1 Lite exudes quality and simply put, feels great in the hand. There are no creeks, the buttons presses feel solid and offer excellent tactile feedback and it appears that the phone could take a beating.. The front of the phone has a 5.3 inch 720p screen with a 20MP front facing camera placed above it. The camera is paired with a selfie flash too and it all ties into the ‘Selfiestan’ brand campaign that Gionee has been promoting. The right side has the volume rocker and power button that is easy to reach out to. The 5.3 inch screen size enables a more compact form factor and this is further enhanced by the lack of any borders around the screen. The bezels too are sufficiently minimal though certainly not along the lines of what we’ve seen on the LG Q6. The dual SIM tray lies along the left side of the handset.. Along the bottom edge lie three capacitive touch keys that correspond to the usual menu, home and back functions. Meanwhile the micro USB connector and headphone jack are placed along the bottom edge.. Flipped over, at the back too, the design is familiar and looks very similar to the Redmi Note 4 in particular. The back of the device is made of aluminum though at the top and bottom are plastic end caps for better antenna performance. Towards the top is a 13MP camera alongside a dual LED flash and below it is the fingerprint reader. We didn’t quite like the Gionee logo silkscreened below the fingerprint reader. All in all, the design isn’t extraordinary but it works and as we said earlier, the construction is great. The phone feels densely built and that makes the A1 Lite appear heavier than it actually is.. Software is what makes or breaks mid range hardware. We’ve seen everything from stock Android to skins that cripple hardware performance. The Gionee A1 Lite lies somewhere in between.. Gionee’s take on Android is now on its 4th iteration with Amigo UI 4.0. Like many other Chinese smartphones, the interface is skinned to look like an iPhone. It also breaks away from some standard UI paradigms that we don’t particularly appreciate. The interface eschews a two level hierarchy and instead places all the apps right on the homescreen. The only way to manage apps is via folders installed on the homescreen. You can swipe between multiple folders to get access to apps quickly without having to dip back into the homescreen area. A fixed shortcut bar lies along the bottom for oft accessed apps.. Eschewing the standard Android process of pulling down the notification tab to access quick toggles, the Gionee A1 Lite requires you to pull up from the bottom edge of the screen. We understand that this has been done to improve one handed access but it adds another step to the learning curve for anyone who has previously used an Android device. The launcher also allows for some basic tweaking using themes and more.. There’s a veritably boat load of bloatware installed on the device, we counted 25 additional apps beyond the essentials. Some of these are simply shortcuts and most can be uninstalled. The system manager app is one of the more useful additions and allows for quick access to useful features like the power manager, controlling data access for apps as well as auto start functionality.. The Gionee A1 Lite is powered by a 1.3GHz Octa-Core Mediatek MT6753 Processor with Mali T-720 GPU which places it at a disadvantage compared to the Snapdragon chipset toting competition. The chipset isn’t really up to par with what the competition is offering and this shows in every day use. The GPU in particular gives cause for concern as even moderately graphic intensive games result in dropped frame rates. The 3GB of RAM helps with multitasking but once again, the processor becomes the constraint once you cross 12 apps or so. The performance isn’t quite terrible but the A1 Lite shouldn’t be your top choice if all out performance is your priority. The phone also has a tendency to heat up. to an uncomfortable degree once you start pushing it.. The Gionee A1 Lite employs a 5.3 inch 720p display that is sufficiently bright for outdoor use. Despite a bright summer sun and generally glossy front panel, we had no issues with using the phone outdoors. What we did not like was the resolution. The phone remains useable but the low resolution panel makes watching movies and viewing photos a bit less enjoyable. It is also possible to view jaggies around text and icons on close inspection. Also add in the fact that most of the competition offers Full HD panels in this price range and you’ve got to take away points from the Gionee A1 Lite.. The 2.5D curved Corning Gorilla Glass 3 panel brings improved scratch protection. The phone uses an IPS panel and so visibility angles are quite decent with. It is possible to adjust the color temperature of the screen and we enjoyed using the phone a lot more with the panel set to warmer hues compared to the rather cool default setting.. Gionee has come a long way with the camera module on the A1 Lite. While still not best in class, it is a marked improvement over what we’ve seen from previous Gionee devices.. We found low light performance to be above average with limited noise. Focussing speed was perfectly adequate but where the phone did suffer was in terms of dynamic range. Even with the HDR mode on, overblown highlights were very common. The camera also tends to be a bit slow when it comes to capturing the shot.. Pressing the shutter button doesn’t necessarily mean an instantaneous capture and this invariably led to more than a few blurry shots.. Connectivity options here are pretty standard and includes. 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and USB OTG. The phone sports a dedicated microSD card slot in addition to the dual SIM slots. Talking about storage, there’s approximately 24GB available at first boot.. Coming to battery life, we were a bit disappointed by what the A1 Lite brought to the table. Despite having a massive 4000 mAh battery, the phone just about lasted a full day of use. We suspect the MediaTek chipset is to be blamed for the less than stellar battery life. In terms of use, we got close to 7 hours or so which is quite low compared to what competing devices have been offering with similarly priced and specced hardware.. The Gionee A1 Lite sits somewhere between the A1 and A1 Plus in terms of general performance and refinement. It would be fair to say that the company has been improving their game but what needs to be pointed out is the fact that the A1 Lite doesn’t really stand up to the competition. Be it Xiaomi, Moto or even Oppo and Vivo, the competition offers hardware that performs better, has better battery life and may even be cheaper.. It’s not all doom and gloom of course as both the cameras and the build quality of the Gionee A1 Lite impress. You could make a case for the device if performance isn’t the primary criteria under consideration. The Gionee A1 Lite is priced at Rs. 14,999 but you’d be better off with the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 or the Moto G5 Plus which simply offer more bang for your buck..
