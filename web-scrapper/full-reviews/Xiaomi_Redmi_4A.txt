Please ask the question in above box. How to install a microSD card in this mobile for storing the apps and videos?. In the SIM slot, you have a provision to place the microSD card. However, you will lose the space for one SIM if you want to do so. Hence, with the microSD card, there is space for only one SIM. The internal storage might be sufficient for storing apps.. Eject the SIM tray, remove the nano-SIM card (if installed), place the microSD card and re-insert the tray.. You can use one SIM card +SD card.. Open the SIM tray, and place the microSD card in the first slot.. What is polycarbonate, if fall mobile can break?. There are different composition levels in polycarbonate material. There is unbreakable polycarbonate material, also used in industrial products. But in case of mobiles where Polycarbonate material might have been used for making the mobile enclosure may not break but the electronic circuitry inside the mobile phone may get affected if it falls from a certain distance above that what is specified by the phone's manufacturer.. How to connect USB OTG in this mobile?. Simply connect your OTG, and it starts to work properly. There is no any extra setting; you just have to connect your OTG and enjoy.

A hybrid SIM card slot in this device are the SIM card slots where you could put two of your SIM cards or a SIM card+a microSD card at the same time. Basically, they don't have any additional function than usual smartphone slots. But they make the slots simpler and productive.. Either you can use 2 SIM cards or 1 SIM card and microSD card at a time.. Means use only 1sim and memory card. It wll not have a specific slot for microSD card.. Either two sim or one sim and memory card.. How to improve the network quality in this phone?. There is no way you can improve network quality on the phone, its capabilities to handle network are inbuilt. The only way is to change the operator who can provide better network connectivity in your area.. Choose an appropriate option from the network option, if that doesn't solve the problem then contact your network service provider. I think it depends on your network operator.

Resolution 720 x 1280 pixels. Features Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features Touch to focus, Smile detection, Face detection, Voice activation, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Effects. Camcorder 1920x1080 (1080p HD) (30 fps), 1280x720 (720p HD) (30 fps). Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Quad-core, 1400 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

CRITIC REVIEW Xiaomi Redmi 4A review: Raising the bar. In a handful of years of its existence, Xiaomi has become quite well-known for bringing all-rounder smartphones at competitive prices. And even though all of the Chinese company’s smartphones have been generally well-received, its budget Redmi line-up has been especially popular. Xiaomi recently launched the Redmi 4A in India. The entry-level smartphone was introduced in China last year and became the top-selling handset during the country’s Singles’ Day sale. The Indian smartphone market has a plethora of options in the budget segment (Rs 7,000 - Rs 15,000). But the entry-level segment doesn’t really have that many (good) options, and that gives the Redmi 4A a golden opportunity to conquer the market. * Great overall experience * Compact design * Good battery backup.

Xiaomi Redmi 4A review: One of the best entry-level smartphones, but only if you can get your hands on it. Xiaomi has been a popular brand in India, and according to a. recent report, has also become the most preferred brand. in the country, over Samsung and Apple. Ever since the launch of the Xiaomi Mi 3 back in mid-2014, Xiaomi has been consistently releasing smartphones while offering a good to unbelievable value proposition.. Other smartphone players have also caught on to Xiaomi’s strategy, and there has definitely been stiff competition in the last one year, but Xiaomi still has a star product in most of the under Rs 30,000 price segments. The only annoying aspect is actually buying a Xiaomi handset. Its flash sales or open sales are notorious for making you wait weeks before you finally get one handset. After these many years, it is high time Xiaomi got this aspect right. It is a pain for mobile phone buyers to wait for weeks before they get lucky in purchasing one handset off the sales.. Recently, Xiaomi released its entry level Redmi device — the Xiaomi Redmi 4A , which is priced at Rs 5,999. Will this be the phone to go for someone thinking of making the switch from a feature phone? Let us find out. Xiaomi’s mid-range devices have started to sport metallic builds. The Xiaomi Redmi 4A being an entry level device, comes with a polycarbonate finish. It weighs in at 131 grams and feels quite light, but sturdy to hold.. The volume rocker and power/standby button on the right hand side give good feedback. The SIM card tray is located on the left hand edge. The phone measures around 8.5 mm thick.. Xiaomi Redmi 4A ensures that there are no sharp edges on the phone, thanks to bevelled edges. This also helps in giving a good grip to the phone. On the rear of the phone there are fine grooves at the top and bottom, but it’s just a design element and it is not meant for antenna bands. The 13 MP rear camera is housed inside a metallic ring and is located on the top left hand corner with an LED flash unit beside it. The Mi branding is prominent on the lower half of the rear side. Towards the base there is a speaker grille section, with a minor chin just below it.. The phone comes with an infrared blaster on the top edge, which also houses the 3.5 mm audio jack. At the base, you have a microUSB port for charging and data transfer. On the front there is a 5-inch HD display with thick bezels on the top and bottom.. Overall, the build quality at this price point isn’t bad at all. The design is nothing out of the ordinary. The one-hand fit element will certainly attract a lot of buyers.. Xiaomi Redmi 4A comes with a 5-inch HD display and houses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 SoC with a. quad-core Cortex A53 processor clocked at 1.4 GHz. The graphics portion is taken care of by an Adreno 308 GPU. The chipset is paired with 2 GB RAM. 16 GB and 32 GB storage variants. We got the 16 GB model to test, which gives around 10.3 GB of usable space. You can expand the storage using a microSD card by. The Xiaomi Redmi 4A comes in a hybrid dual SIM configuration (micro SIM + nano SIM), supports Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS with A-GPS, GLONASS and BDS. It comes with a micro USB port for charging and data transfer, and there is no support for fast charging.. Thankfully it bundles in an FM radio as well. On the camera front, you get a 13 MP rear camera, along with a 5 MP selfie camera. All this is powered by a non-removable 3,120 mAh Li-ion battery.. The Xiaomi Redmi 4A comes with a 5-inch IPS LCD display with a 1280x720 pixel resolution. While the colours look good and the viewing angles are fine, you do notice dithering on the text when you are using WhatsApp and other apps. when the text size is selected as 'Small' from the settings menu.. While watching videos, the sharpness and colour reproduction is quite good. Changing viewing angles only affects the brightness to an extent, but I didn’t notice any colour shifting. Sunlight legibility could have been better; you have no option but to boost up the brightness. Overall, the display is quite good for this segment of phones.. The phone comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow with MIUI 8 skin atop it. This was the same combination seen on the recently launched Redmi Note 4. The MIUI 8 skin has some minor additions over the MIUI 7, such as a smaller clock widget on the home screen, a redesigned notification and status bar (the status bar looks a lot more artistic on the MIUI 8), redesigned weather app and more.. There aren’t many changes at a functional level, but just a minor. One thing that stood out was the way the screenshot thumbnail floats on the top right hand corner of the screen after you take a screenshot. Taking a screenshot (holding down on the volume down and power button) would take a wee bit longer than usual. There is a definite lag one notices with the animations and when launching apps.. It features an app called Second Space which has been out since last year. basically lets you create separate profiles for different use cases. For instance, you can have one mode for work and one mode for office — with different wallpapers, app icon arrangement, et al. It replicates another instance for you.. This is an entry level phone, so as far as the regular tasks are concerned, it does not falter. The Snapdragon 425 SoC paired with 2 GB RAM fulfills all the needs of an entry level user. But the software glitches are noticeable on quite a few occasions. For instance, there were many instances when after getting done with a call, despite hitting the red coloured end call button, it would require two-three presses for the call to end. The response tends to be a bit delayed. I'm sure it's nothing that a future update cannot resolve.. There is lag when switching between apps and while opening some heavy apps. Gaming is fine for casual games, don’t bother with heavy titles such as Asphalt 8: Airborne. Apart from the lag, it will also take up a lot of space on your phone — remember, you have only 10.3 GB usable. You can add a microSD card, thankfully.. The phone does not heat much, unless you are running heavy apps onboard. At no instance during the testing did we notice any app shutting down due to overheating.. In terms of benchmarks, there are no surprises here. The call quality is excellent and I faced absolutely no issues with that. The loudspeaker is quite poor though, you will be better off with a pair of good earphones.. The Xiaomi Redmi 4A comes with a 13 MP rear camera with an f/2.2 aperture and a 5 MP front-facing camera with an f/2.2 aperture. The camera interface is similar to what we have come to expect from Xiaomi phones. There are a lot more filters to choose from, with some interesting ones such as Tunnel and Mirror. The manual mode only lets you adjust white balance and ISO. In the video mode, you only get the time-lapse mode (no slow motion recording).. In terms of image quality, there is definitely a loss of sharpness when you are pixel peeping, and it. But for sharing on social media websites, the images are good enough. The HDR mode is not on by default, as it is with higher end Xiaomi phones. HDR mode when on, takes a couple of seconds to process the image.. Also, over processing of images is noticeable in low light conditions, thereby giving them a waxy feel. Shooting post sundown is a challenge and the Redmi 4A is not really able to handle it well. But then again, this is an entry level smartphone, and for this price, you are getting quite a decent shooter, one that can put phones priced at twice the MRP to shame.. There was a time when entry-level phones had not so impressive batteries, but not so anymore. Large capacity battery phones are coming in at increasingly affordable prices. The Xiaomi Redmi 4A for instance, packs in a 3,120 mAh battery, which is quite some capacity. The iPhone 7 Plus in comparison packs a smaller battery.. Add in the fact that the 4A. is powered by a low-power Snapdragon 425 SoC and the fact that is. Together, this means that you can easily extract a work-day's worth of battery life out of the Redmi 4A. A battery charged around 12:30 AM lasted me till 6.30 PM on the next day, which is quite impressive. PCMark for Android gives around 12 hours 32 mins, which is again. In fact on a light day I was even able to extract over a day and half worth of battery from the Redmi 4A.. The Xiaomi Redmi 4A is priced at Rs 5,999. At this price point, you are getting a lot of value for your money. The only challenge, rather, an irritant, with Xiaomi phones is their online-only open sale model where phones get sold out in seconds. It is quite annoying that Xiaomi hasn’t yet made the process of buying a smartphone online any easier. That seems to be a major roadblock. and could easily put off many potential buyers. Xiaomi should understand that this isn't 2013 and that the competition has evolved.. In terms of build quality, display, battery life, etc., the Xiaomi Redmi 4A is quite impressive. Yes, there is a noticeable lag in the user interface, but for someone who is moving from feature phone to a smartphone, that should not be as great an issue. The camera is great for daylight photographs, but low light shots leave a lot to be desired.. In terms of competition at this price point, you have nothing that offers anything comparable. Sure, there are lots of devices under the Rs 6k price point, but they pale in comparison with the Redmi 4A. So if this is your first smartphone purchase, the 4A. You'll just need to get lucky in the sales.. #Xiaomi Redmi 4a Value For Money.

Now, the device seems to have received the Android 7.1.2 Nougat topped with MIUI Global Beta 7.11.16.. The MIUI Global Beta 7.11.16 ROM based on Android 7.1.2 Nougat brings the October security patch and other updates to the smartphone. This is the MIUI beta update and the stable ROM might be rolled out in a month or two. If you are impatient to try your hands on this update, then you can download the recovery ROM and flash it manually on your Redmi 4A smartphone or download the fastboot ROM and flash it using the fastboot method.. Going by the information revealed by the official Mi forums , the Redmi 4A update will bring several new features and improvements. It will bring new app vault features such as calendar, cricket, events, brief notes, and shortcuts. Also, there will be changes to the status bar, notification bar, and lockscreen. There will be a new content provider for Wallpaper Carousel - Glance. There will be a fix to the landscape mode issues those were existent earlier. Also, there will be a fix to the settings FC when changing the region.. The Redmi 4A will get a fix to the system launcher that keeps stopping when adding or opening a widget after receiving the update to 7.11.10. There will also be a fix to Gallery only on showing documents after resetting all the default app settings. There will also be a fix to the issue when the gallery cannot be accessed by pressing the button directly from the camera app. The mail message page layout that will be displayed incorrectly has also been fixed..

Ketan Pratap , 23 March 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Xiaomi Redmi 4A has been priced at Rs. It's a decent option for first-time smartphone buyers. Gadgets 360 rates the phone 7 out of 10. Xiaomi Redmi 4A design Xiaomi Redmi 4A specifications and software Xiaomi Redmi 4A camera performance Xiaomi Redmi 4A performance. The Redmi series has anchored Xiaomi in the sub-Rs. The company launched its first Redmi smartphone, the Redmi 1S , in India in August 2014, and it was received well here. At a recent event, Xiaomi stressed how the Redmi 1S "was a phone way ahead of its time" and claimed that the new Redmi 4A is exactly the same.. That might be true, because other phones in the series including the Redmi 2 (and Redmi 2 Prime ) in 2015, and Redmi 3S (and Redmi 3S Prime ) in 2016 have impressed us consistently. These models have also been regular fixtures in our lists of the best smartphones under Rs. Xiaomi has already had one big success in 2017, selling over a million units of the Redmi Note 4 within a record 45 days of its launch. The Chinese company hopes to keep that momentum going with the Redmi 4A, which brings features such as VoLTE and a 13-megapixel rear camera to the budget segment. Will the new Xiaomi Redmi 4A be as big a hit for the company? We try to find out in our review.. One of the first things you notice when you hold the Xiaomi Redmi 4A in your hands is that despite looking a lot like metal, the body is actually polycarbonate. The rear panel has separate segments at the top and bottom that mimic the antenna bands seen on metal-bodied Redmi models.. The new smartphone closely follows the design language of previous Redmi phones, and buyers in this price segment won't be disappointed. With a relatively small 5-inch screen, the Redmi 4A is compact and therefore easy to use with just one hand. The volume rocker and power button are easily accessible on the right side, while the hybrid SIM slot is on the left. The charging port is on the bottom, and there's a 3.5mm audio jack and infrared emitter on the top.. From the rear, this phone looks strikingly similar to the Redmi 3S. The Mi branding and the speaker grille at the back, are identical to those on the Redmi 3S. There is no fingerprint reader on the Redmi 4A, which isn't a surprise considering its price tag.. The phone has slightly curved edges, though we would prefer the overall shape of the Redmi 3S, which is more rounded and fits better in a palm, in our experience. On the Redmi 4A, the sides meet the edges with only a slight curve. However, the rear panel of this phone has a matte finish and offers a slightly better grip.. At roughly 132 grams, the Redmi 4A is lighter than the Redmi 3S which weighs 144 grams. Xiaomi announced at the India launch that the Redmi 4A is the "lightest Redmi ever." Notably, both models are 8.5mm thick. The Redmi 4A has been launched in three colours - Dark Grey, Gold, and Rose Gold. We received a Dark Grey unit for review.. The Xiaomi Redmi 4A comes with a charger, Micro-USB cable, warranty card, user guide, and SIM eject tool. As with other Xiaomi products, the Redmi 4A's retail box doesn't include a headset, which might be disappointing for some users. The retail box flaunts a "Made in India" tag. At its launch event, Xiaomi stated that 95 percent of its phones are now manufactured in India.. The Redmi 4A features a 5-inch HD (720x1280-pixel) display and boasts of a 296ppi pixel density. The company claims that the screen can reproduce 72 percent of the NTSC colour gamut. The display is vivid, and colour reproduction is adequate. We had no problems using the phone under direct sunlight. Text and images appear sharp while videos look good. The Redmi 4A offers a Reading mode which makes colours easier on the eyes, and also allows colour temperature adjustment through the Settings app.. The smartphone is powered by a quad-core Snapdragon 425 processor clocked at 1.4GHz, with integrated Adreno 308 graphics. It has 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage which can be expanded using a microSD card (up to 128GB). The handset packs a non-removable 3120mAh battery, which the company claims can deliver seven days of standby time. Apart from 4G with VoLTE, the Redmi 4A supports Bluetooth 4.1, Wi-Fi 801.11 b/g/n, GPS/AGPS, and GLONASS.. The hybrid dual-SIM slot can hold one Micro-SIM and either a Nano-SIM or a microSD card at one time. When two SIM cards are used, the primary one can support 4G calls and data while the secondary SIM falls back to 2G calls only. The sensors on board include a gyroscope, accelerometer, proximity sensor, and ambient light sensor.. The Redmi 4A runs on MIUI 8 based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The company at the launch stressed that there are a lot of features designed for Indian users. MIUI now supports 13 Indic languages including Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Marathi, Assamese, and Bengali.. On the software front, a lot of features that were seen on previous Redmi phones have made it to the Redmi 4A, including the Dual Apps feature which allows users to create and sign in to two separate instances of any app (like WhatsApp, Facebook, and more) on the same device, and Second Space, which allows users to separate their business and personal data on the same phone. The Second Space feature also allows users to be signed in to two separate Google accounts.. The Redmi 4A allows users to take scrolling screenshots, so for example you can save an entire Web page which doesn't fit on one screen. Some of the other MIUI features include a Child Mode that lets you lock apps; the hovering Quick Ball button which provides quick shortcuts; and One-Handed Mode to shrink the display to one corner of the screen.. The dialler app in the MIUI 8 also has been improved and shows caller ID by default. We need to also give a special mention to the Mi Mover app that lets you move data from another Mi phone. There's a Themes app which lets you pick from a vast collection of wallpapers, ringtones, and fonts, some of which cost money. However, we do wish that Xiaomi could reduce the amount of bloatware on the Redmi 4A since it has only 16GB of storage. There are plenty of 'redundant' apps including Scanner, Mi Community, and Mi Picks. The Redmi 4A also ships with Facebook, Amazon Kindle, WPS Office, Makemytrip, and Flipkart preinstalled.. At its India launch event, Xiaomi also previewed a redesigned messaging app which will change how IRCTC train tickets are formatted on screen. When you receive a confirmation message from IRCTC, Xiaomi's MIUI 8 will recognise it and reformat it to look like an actual ticket, which will be visually refreshing.. The Redmi 4A has a 13-megapixel rear camera with a 5-element lens and f/2.2 aperture. It also has an LED flash, and supports low-light enhancement, HDR, panorama, burst mode, and face recognition. You also get plenty of real-time filters which can be used for fun. There is a 5-megapixel front-facing camera with an f/2.2 aperture as well. You get 1080p and 720p video recording options at 30fps.. The phone's main camera manages to take pretty good shots with decent colours as long as there is enough light around. Shots taken during the day have better details. We were able to focus on objects quickly enough, but noticed that the camera at times struggled with close-up shots. Some of our close-up shots taken with the Redmi 4A ended up with lots of noise.. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi 4A camera samples. The rear camera on the Xiaomi Redmi 4A. didn't fare too well under artificial lighting, and shots ended up with some amount of noise. Low-light shots tended to have a decent amount of detail, though they were quite grainy. The front camera is able to take sharp and detailed selfies that can be used on social platforms, though it doesn't do well in low light. The phone can record 1080p videos, and the quality is good. The camera app is easy to use, and we liked the fact that access to modes and other things takes just one tap.. We were fairly impressed with the overall performance of the Redmi 4A. There was no lag when multitasking, and it easily handled switching between multiple apps. We enjoyed streaming videos and movies on the Redmi 4A, but have to admit that the 5-inch screen feels a bit too small since we're so used to bigger phones now.. Gaming on the Redmi 4A was also fun, and we had a good time playing Asphalt 8 and Dead Effect 2. These games initially froze when we tried launching them because multiple other apps were already running at the background. During our review, we noticed that there was roughly 900MB of free memory at any given time, and we did feel that more RAM could have helped.. The Redmi 4A packs 16GB on board storage out of which users get roughly 10GB of usable space, and this means that we had to rely on expandable storage. The Infrared emitter on the Redmi 4A lets you control various appliances at home and works well with a variety of set-top boxes and TVs.. The loudspeaker on the handset is loud enough to fill a small room, and you should not expect it to outperform phones priced twice as high as this one. Earphones are not bundled with the unit, so we checked audio quality through our own wired earphones, and it was decent. Xiaomi offers various audio tweaking options in the Settings app.. The phone supports video formats like HEVC and MPEG4 among others plus popular audio formats including PCM, AAC/eAAC+, MP3, FLAC, and WAV.. One of the highlights of the Xiaomi Redmi 4A is that it supports VoLTE (voice over LTE), and the handset was able to latch on to networks even in areas with weak signals. Call quality was decent, and we could have long conversations comfortably because of how small and light this phone is. We didn't feel any overheating during our review.. The Redmi 4A got respectable scores in our benchmark tests. It managed 27,567 in AnTuTu, 16,693 overall in Quadrant, 3,684 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme, and 13fps in GFXBench's T-Rex test.. The non-removable 3120mAh battery gave us an impressive 12 hours and 35 minutes in our HD video loop test. With heavy real-world usage, the Redmi 4A was a powerhouse, and easily lasted for over a day. It's worth noting that this was without using the power saver mode.. We did try this mode on the Redmi 4A when the battery was down to just 20 percent, and it gave us 8 hours of light usage beyond that. You can choose apps to exempt from restrictions due to the battery saver. We found that the phone took less than two hours to charge fully. Fast charging isn't supported but this shouldn't be a dealbreaker for consumers looking for a smartphone at this price.. Verdict The new Redmi 4A definitely raises the bar for smartphones at this price level, and we expect it to be very popular. 5,999, the Redmi 4A offers a lot of features, especially VoLTE support. Camera performance is decent, and the polycarbonate body, 3120mAh battery, and software are all satisfactory.. It will be interesting to see how well the Redmi 4A performs compared to the Redmi 3S which is still available at Rs. 1,000 more, users can get a metal body, better Snapdragon 430 processor, and more battery power if they choose to buy a Redmi 3S instead.. The Redmi 4A seems to be targeted at first-time smartphone buyers, and for that audience, it seems like a decent option..

Have been using it for fewdays now here are some pointers for you 1. Cover fits the best and protection it gives is very good. Especially from the screen side it has a little extra depth around scree so that if you put your phon4 upside down it doesn't touch the surface. Provides firm grip on your phone so your phone doesn't fall from your hand. Addssome weight to your phone and your phone doesn't feel as lightweight which some peoplle prefer some don't so you decide that. I have an issue it is highly priced but the quality is good and i hardlly think i would be needing any other cover for this phone ever again so it was a one time investment for me. You hae to just ppress a little and the response will be very good. I Never had to press the buttons hard or anything everything is super smooth and cutting for different ports is perfectly done.

Xiaomi Redmi 4A review: Raising the bar Komal Mohan | Gadgets Now | Apr 1, 2017, 01.39PM IST. * Great overall experience * Compact design * Good battery backup. In a handful of years of its existence, Xiaomi has become quite well-known for bringing all-rounder smartphones at competitive prices. And even though all of the Chinese company’s smartphones have been generally well-received, its budget Redmi line-up has been especially popular.. Xiaomi recently launched the Redmi 4A in India. The entry-level smartphone was introduced in China last year and became the top-selling handset during the country’s Singles’ Day sale.. The Indian smartphone market has a plethora of options in the budget segment (Rs 7,000 - Rs 15,000). But the entry-level segment doesn’t really have that many (good) options, and that gives the Redmi 4A a golden opportunity to conquer the market.. So at a price of Rs 5,999, does the Redmi 4A manage to stand out? We played around with the budget smartphone for a few days, and here’s the rest of our review.. Even though majority of the smartphones today come with metallic construction, the Xiaomi Redmi 4A has a plastic body. It has a polycarbonate matte-finished back with a 13MP rear camera and LED flash at the top left corner, and the Mi branding and speaker grille at the bottom. The back is exactly the same as the previously-launched Redmi 3S. However, there’s no fingerprint sensor on the Redmi 4A. We believe this might drive away some potential users, as even the most basic of smartphones come with fingerprint scanners these days.. Having slightly curved edges, the 4A has the volume rocker and power buttons on the right, and the SIM slot on the left. The bottom edge has a microUSB port and the top has a 3.5mm audio jack. The front is dominated by a 5-inch display. The screen has three capacitive (non-backlit) keys and an LED indicator below it, and the earpiece and 5MP selfie-camera above it.. Talking about the display, the Redmi 4A has a 5-inch HD display of 720x1280 pixel resolution and 296ppi pixel density. In our time with the device, we found the display to be good enough for an entry level smartphone. It has accurate colour reproduction and impressive viewing angles. The sunlight legibility is good too. The display has a 'Reading Mode' which eliminates all the Blue light, reducing eye strain. You can also change the strength for Reading Mode and also select the apps in which you require it to be activated.. All-in-all, we found the design of the Xiaomi Redmi 4A to be quite likeable. At the given price, it offers great looks, a good display and is lightweight too.. Xiaomi Redmi 4A is powered by a 1.4GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processor coupled with Adreno 308 GPU. It offers 2GB RAM along with 16GB of internal storage. The storage can be expanded via microSD cards of up to 128GB in size.. The Redmi 4A runs Xiaomi’s MIUI 8 skin based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The interface is clean and user friendly. But there is no app drawer and all apps are placed on multiple home-screens. The device offers a ‘second space’, which enables users to have different profiles with separate wallpapers, apps, files and photos. Other MIUI-specific features include a Child Mode that lets users lock apps, a hovering ‘Quick Ball’ button which provides quick shortcuts and a One-Handed Mode that shrinks the display to one corner of the screen.. The phones comes pre-loaded with third-party apps such as Facebook, Amazon Kindle, MakeMyTrip that can be uninstalled.. Just like majority of other Xiaomi smartphones, the Redmi 4A comes with an IR blaster that can be used to control home appliances such as TV and ACs. The pre-installed Mi remote app enables users to add multiple remote controls for different appliances and use them from the phone itself.. During our testing, we found the overall performance of the Xiaomi Redmi 4A to satisfactory. The phone handled multi-tasking to random app switching without any heating issues. Audio quality is also quite good.. As for the network reception, it was good during our testing. The phone handled calls even in areas of problematic coverage.. Coming to the battery, Xiaomi Redmi 4A's 3,120mAh battery easily lasted us more than a full day on a single charge with moderate use. This included playing games and browsing social media for a few hours, all while staying connected to Wi-Fi or cellular data.. We ran Antutu and GeekBench 4 tests on our device. While the phone scored 32,588 in Antutu Benchmarks, the single-core and multi-core scores on GeekBench 4 were 626 and 1611 respectively.. On the connectivity front, Redmi 4A offers Hybrid dual-SIM, 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, and microUSB.. Moving on to the cameras, Xiaomi Redmi 4A has a 13MP rear camera with dual LED flash. There’s also a 5MP front-facing camera for selfies. The camera app is pretty basic and supports HDR, burst mode, and face recognition and panorama, among others. Users can apply live filters at the time of clicking photos and the manual offers advanced features with controls for things like shutter speed and focus. Other features of the app include a Face Beauty mode for better selfies.. The photos that we took using the Redmi 4A's rear camera were decent. They pack fair amount of detail and colour reproduction is good too. The front camera is average though. Images taken in well-lit conditions are good, but the same can't be said about low-light shots. The camera is capable of recording videos at both 1080p and 720p videos at 30fps.. All in all, for an entry level smartphone, the Redmi 4A’s camera experience is good.. At a price of Rs 5,999, the Xiaomi Redmi 4A is an exceptionally competent smartphone. With specifications such as 13MP rear camera, a 3,120mAh battery and VoLTE support, it offers a lot of features. It’ll surely give tough competition to peers such as Xolo Era 2X and Coolpad Mega 2.5D, which are priced in the same bracket.. performance Quad core display 5.0" (12.7 cm) storage 16 GB camera 13 MP battery 3120 mAh ram 2 GB See Full Specifications.
