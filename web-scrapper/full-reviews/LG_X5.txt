Mid-range LG X5, X power and X skin are unveiled and fully detailed in Korea. Adrian Diaconescu July 5, 2016 7:19 am. With the premium, groundbreaking but perhaps too costly and gimmicky G5 apparently not doing quite as well as expected at the global box-office , LG is back at throwing everything it has against the wall to see what sticks.. We’ve started to lose count of all the recent additions to the non-flagship X family, as the LG X5 and X skin today follow the suit of the X mach, style and max a few weeks ago. Not to mention the LG X power first broke cover in mid-June, finally getting a full spec sheet and official Korean price tag now.. At 200,000 won ($175), the big-battery 5.3-incher offers arguably the best bang for buck of the three just-announced phones, with HD screen resolution, quad-core processing power, 2GB RAM, 16GB expandable storage, 13 and 5MP cameras, Android 6.0 Marshmallow, a 7.9mm waist, and above all, 4,100 mAh juice in tow.. Meanwhile, the LG X5 downgrades cell capacity to 2,800 mAh, stretches the 720p display to 5.5 inches, shaves 0.7 mm off the profile, and retains all the other features at an identical $175 price.. Lastly, the LG X skin will inexplicably cost KRW 231,000 ($200), standing out as the lightest, slimmest model of the bunch, but merely sporting a 5-inch HD panel, 8MP rear cam, 1.5GB RAM, and 2,100 mAh battery..

Adrian has had an insatiable passion for writing since he was in school and found himself writing philosophical essays about the meaning of life and the differences between light and dark beer. Later, he realized this was pretty much his only marketable skill, so he first created a personal blog (in Romanian) and then discovered his true calling, which is writing about all things tech (in English)..

LG X5 in a nutshell: UK specs, price, release date. What are the LG X5 specs?. Do we know the UK price and release date of the LG X5?. LG has just launched some new mid-range X-Series smartphones, including the 5.5-inch LG X5 which packs some fairly standard specs. Here’s everything we know so far about the LG X5’s specs, features, UK price and release date.. LG’s X-Series mobile phones are mid-range handsets, usually costing around £150 to £250 here in the UK, and packing a single stand-out feature. So far in 2016 we’ve already seen the dual-display LG X Screen and the LG X Cam , which packs a decent snapper for the price.. And now we have three new LG X-Series mobiles to add to that list: the LG X Power , the LG X Skin (a.k.a. the X Style) and the LG X5, which seems to be a rather vanilla entry in the range.. The LG X5 is a 5.5-inch phone packing a 720p HD screen. It’s reasonably slender at 7.2mm and light at 133g, coming in a choice of white or black colours. The X5 is powered by a 1.3GHz quad-core processor (chipset unknown) backed by 2GB of RAM, for hopefully reliable mid-range performance. Android 6.0 Marshmallow is the OS of choice, with LG’s UX overlay on top.. Rounding off the X5’s specs is a 2800mAh battery, plus a 13-megapixel rear camera and 5-megapixel front-facing snapper.. So far it’s unknown whether the LG X5 will be officially released in the UK, although you will of course be able to import if not. Given the specs, we’d hope for a price around £130 to £150, to keep the X5 competitive; after all, these specs aren’t too far off the LG K8 (available for £99 in the UK), Honor 5c and Vodafone’s own Smart Ultra 7 .. We’ll update with more LG X5 specs and news when we have it.. LG G6 vs Google Pixel XL: Which is best for me?. Best LG phones you can buy in 2017. LG V30 vs LG V20 Rumours: What’s the difference?.
