Better to buy Sony Xperia E1 except of Nokia X. By Shaique Rizwan | 1 May 2014. I had used Nokia X for a whole month. It looks very good in hands from outside. But its performance is not too good as compared to Sony Xperia E1 at same prices. Nokia X is only good looking phone but not a good phone for its performance. And if we will root it for Google services then it gives more poor performance. And also it is not looking same as lumia UI. It looks shabby as compared to its lumia UI live tiles. And also lumia type live tiles is not live as it only gives the preview of saved images only.. And the most important thing is that Nokia X is running only 4.1 jellybean OS where as Sony Xperia E1 is running 4.3 jellybean and also can update to the latest Kitkat 4.4 android version. At last i came to this conclusion that a user will not have to buy Nokia X as it gives very bad performance.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 11 out of 11 people found this review helpful. Good phone marred by microsoft restrictions. By Debojyoti Kundu | 8 May 2014. I got my nokia x few weeks back for my father at 7k and I am quite happy with my decision. The phone has a good build quality and the screen is also surprisingly good at this price. The loudspeaker is loud enough to watch videos and call quality is also loud and clear. The ui is unique for an android device but it is pretty straightforward and easy to use. The device runs smoothly with some occasional lags when multiple apps are open. Games like plants vs zombies runs perfectly and didn't slow down the device. However I have not tried any high end games on this phone. The phone comes preloaded with lots of games mostly junk. The only drawback is non availability of Google apps which is bad as we are all used to multiple Google services in our lives particularly Google now and the maps. However you can sideload apps apk and run them if they are supported. The Nokia app store has a decent number of popular apps which are enough for most users. The camera is ok as you shouldn't expect a good one at this price. Overall a nice phone in this budget if you are not too much into gaming and dont bother about tons of apps.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 4 out of 4 people found this review helpful. By Praful Yadav | 5 May 2014. Firstly I will give 10/10 to Nokia to accept Android Os. But when we think it without google services, we may think it's not good enough like other android devices. But as per my taste Its a great move from boring classic icon based interfaces to a metro look android device. Now some points for those who interested to buy this device but little bit confused. Ok, I'm expressing something why one may opt nokia x series phone.. OneDrive (Free cloud space to store personal data). Outlook (the better mailing experience with Microsoft). Less battery consume as heavy google devices outed. Nokia Extended Warranty service up to 3 years. So, One request to those, who are writing bad comments without using it, please don't do it. Just use it & then post your comments.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 4 out of 5 people found this review helpful. By Ravi Ninjar | 8 May 2014. I purchased Nokia X last month with hopes that Nokia would surely provide a reliable phone. Needless to say, I am disappointed by the purchase.. There are several flaws, fastlane is just meaningless. Also, the unlocking system is worthless, my calls gets disconnected while removing my phone from the pocket.. I cracked my screen last week :), but even Nokia service stations in 2 cities don't have a replacement.. The phone heats up a lot and call quality is not up to mark. The camera is too basic and low light captures are just blank. Overall, Nokia should have invested to have better phone experiences. People please stay away from this one as it is a sheer waste of money.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 2 out of 2 people found this review helpful. An affordable android smartphone from Nokia. By Irshu Lx | 15 May 2014. the screen is amazing for a midlevel smartphone. I replaced the existing tile based UI with "GO Launcher ", now the UI is smooth and fluid. I give it 9.5/10 because i dont have access to Play store.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 2 out of 3 people found this review helpful. Nokia X Software Platform 1.2 Update Now Rolling Out.

The Good The Nokia X is as well built as you'd expect from this company, and its battery easily lasts for a day and a half. The dual-SIM feature can be useful.. The Bad This low-end phone is sluggish and at times, responds very slowly to your touch. The ugly UI doesn't help much with the user experience either. You'll need to do some work importing your contacts if they're stored in the cloud, and the Nokia Store lacks some apps (you'll have to install a third-party store).. The Bottom Line Bogged down by sluggish performance and a lacklustre UI, the Nokia X only disappoints.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. The Nokia X is cheap but colorful. Design The rear cover is removable. Features Software It looks similar to Windows Phone, but it isn't nearly as slick. You'll need to venture outside of the Nokia Store if you want apps such as WhatsApp. Rumors of Nokia making an Android smartphone had been churning for a long time. Finally, at Mobile World Congress in March, the Finnish company unveiled a new range of phones, the X, X+ and XL , aimed at those who can't afford hundreds of dollars or pounds on a new mobile.. Running on a forked version of Android , the X range of devices lack Google Play services, which Nokia has ignored, choosing to feature Microsoft's products instead. While this seems like a good idea on paper, Android doesn't really stand up too well without the Google foundations -- but more on that later.. Furthermore, as these are cheap smartphones meant for emerging markets (taking over from the previous Asha range of phones), Nokia has chosen to go with low-end specs, which impacts the performance and user experience.. Nokia is best known for the build quality of its smartphones, and the Nokia X isn't any different. Despite a low retail price of around $140 (€89 in Europe and around £100 in the UK), the phone feels solid and well-made. The 128g device sits quite comfortably in one's palm.. The phone sports a 4-inch display with a resolution of 800x480 pixels, and instead of the three menu buttons found on most Android devices, the Nokia X only has one, which lets you go back. To get back to the home screen, you press and hold it.. The rear cover is removable, swappable for different colors, and sports a matte finish. You'll need to open up the back to access the dual-SIM card slots which is located next to the 1,500mAh battery.. As a low-cost smartphone, the Nokia X doesn't come with the bells and whistles you'll find on more expensive phones. What you get are the basics: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.. The X comes with just 4GB of onboard storage, but don't let that stop you -- Nokia has chosen to include a microSD card slot. This gives you an additional 32GB of storage, should you need it.. Powered by the Nokia X platform, the operating system is what's known as a "forked" version of Android. It's based on Google's code, but the interface is all Nokia -- and it doesn't come with any Google apps. (You can install them if you "root" the device, but that will void the warranty.) Instead, what you get is a mix and match of Nokia apps as well as some tweaks to allow Microsoft's Bing search engine into the picture.. While this may sound like a fine idea in theory, Google has made its services a very large part of the Android ecosystem, and because of that, the Nokia X feels lacking. For a start, if you've already made purchases on the Google Play store on your old phone, these aren't transferrable.. This is point is moot if you're a new smartphone user, but you're still missing out on the sheer number of available apps in the Google Play store. Popular messaging app WhatsApp wasn't available on the Nokia Store, for example, so I had to download a third-party app store called 1MobileMarket and install it from there instead.. The lack of Google support also means you won't readily be importing your contacts from your Gmail account. In my case I manually downloaded my address book as a vCard. The Nokia X didn't recognise the country codes in front of the phone numbers, however, so incoming calls and messages won't show contact details.. As for the UI, it's still the same Windows Phone lookalike from when it was announced at Mobile World Congress , and unlike the more usable Microsoft mobile operating system, the Nokia X is confusing.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges..

A well built and designed budget smartphone that shows off some of the best of Nokia. It's let down by weak performance, but at the right price it's a strong offering despite an uncertain future.. Ever since Nokia decided to go all-in with Windows Phone, there has been a nagging feeling that it would have been better off using Android as its mobile operating system of choice.. A feeling that has got stronger as Android devices have so rapidly taken over the lion's share of smartphone sales.. At Mobile Web Congress in February 2014, Nokia finally fulfilled this dream by announcing the Nokia X range comprising the Nokia X (reviewed here), a higher specified X+ and the physically larger Nokia XL. Not just one Android phone, but a whole range.. There was more than a little irony in seeing Stephen Elop, once a Microsoft stalwart and the architect of Nokia's Windows Phone strategy announcing these new devices on stage. He went to great pains to point out that the Nokia X is a phone running AOSP, the Android Open Source Project.. This project underpins every Android phone in the world. As always in the Nokia story, it is not quite as simple as that. While the Nokia X runs Android, it does not run Google Android.. Briefly, Android as we know it is typically made of two parts; the underlying Android system and the Google apps. The underlying Android system is what the Nokia X runs along with all the usual well known Android phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S range and the HTC One M8 .. Unlike those devices though, the Nokia X does not run Google apps. In order to run Google apps – Gmail, Maps, Calendar, Google Now etc – phones need to be certified. Nokia has not taken this step and it has done so on purpose.. The Nokia X software is based off of Android 4.1, a version released in July 2012. There is so far no information on updates but we can only hope Android 4.4 is planned as that version is designed to run on lower end hardware.. Nokia has designed the X to use the equivalent services from itself and from Microsoft, and Nokia has provided an API for everything that Google provides meaning that developers should be able to port apps quite easily.. This makes the Nokia X an Android phone by name, but one that would perhaps be unfamiliar to those already used to running Android on other mainstream devices. If you are thinking of switching to the Nokia X from another Android device, it is most important to note that the Play Store is not available.. It is possible to side-load any legally obtainable apps including other app stores such as the Amazon app store, but even that wont bring Google services to the Nokia X.. Who would have imagined a Microsoft product running Android? It does seem like an anomaly, and by the looks of it that's exactly what the Nokia X will be - an anomaly.. Microsoft has announced that it will be ditching its Android plans altogether , leaving just four Nokia branded handsets running the heavily modified version of Google's platform - the X, X+, XL and X2.. Moving on from this muted outlook, what do you get on the Nokia X? The standout software included are Nokia HERE Maps, a fantastic alternative to Google apps, and Nokia MixRadio which is a great way to stream your favorite music on demand.. Instead of the Play Store you will find the Nokia Store, which is already starting to fill out with many top apps. Nokia include Facebook and Twitter apps along with BlackBerry Messenger as standard. Various simple games are loaded on the X as well. All these apps run on a heavily customised version of Android 4.1.. Powering the Nokia X is a dual-core Snapdragon S4 Play processor running at 1GHz with 512Mb of RAM and 4GB of internal storage, which can be supplemented by a microSD card. The X has a 4-inch WVGA (800 x 480) LCD display and a fixed focus 3MP camera on the back. These are very modest specs indeed and that does end up informing the whole experience of using the Nokia X.. What makes up for that is the price, the range starts at just €89, £80 (around $120, AU$135). This is a phone targeted at emerging markets, at people who are buying their first smartphone and perhaps their first phone. Some buyers of the Nokia X will have never bought any sort of computing device before.. Nokia has brought the X range to Europe, including the UK, but it has been clearly designed to replace the top end of Nokia's Asha range of phones. The Asha range is filled with very nicely designed but slow and simple feature phones, which have very limited capabilities.. The Nokia X is a decent step up from an Asha device and has the potential to do a lot more. Here in the UK, other reasonable smartphones are available for a similar price as the X but in its first market, India, this is not the case. Phones at a similar price point suffer from extremely bad design and build quality and very poor performance.. Despite the meager specifications and just a 1500mAh battery, the Nokia X provides a reasonable upgrade for users in these emerging markets who are upgrading from either feature phones or locally produced budget handsets which simply will not have Nokia's level of design and build.. When you pull the rear shell off the Nokia X model it is possible to see another indicator as to the target markets for this new range. The Nokia X is a dual SIM device.. In many other markets, the best value for cellular connectivity is achieved by separating your contracts for voice usage and data usage, which mandates two SIM cards. It's like running your calls through Vodafone and your data through T-Mobile.. On the X, the dual SIM setup supports dual standby that means both SIM cards can be active at the same time. Only slot one supports 3G connections, so that is where you will want to put your data SIM. Both slots are of the micro SIM variety. There is no 4G in sight here, but that is hardly a surprise.. The X range comes in a lovely range of colours with the basic X is available in black, white, cyan, yellow, bright red and the bright green, which is especially striking. The slightly higher spec X+ shares the same palette while the larger XL swaps the red for an even nicer orange colour.. Nokia has done what Nokia always seems to do at the budget end of its range. It has designed and built a phone that looks and feels more expensive than it is, something Nokia do not get enough plaudits for..

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 4 GB + MicroSD. View all photos (42). Click to read the full review. Too little RAM memory (0.5 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (233 ppi). The most prominent feature of the Nokia X is the fact that it runs on a “forked” version of Android. Nokia took the open source parts of Android from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and built a new platform on top of it. In terms of specs, the Nokia X is a decidedly affordable smartphone that impresses with price, not with ground-breaking silicon. It comes with a 4-inch 480 x 800-pixel capacitive IPS LCD touchscreen, a 3-megapixel fixed-focus camera and a 1GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 chip. With 512MB of RAM and 4GB of storage, it looks decently powerful for its price.. The device comes in one of six colors, and all of them are typically vibrant and cheerful in a typical Nokia fashion. The Nokia X features only 3G connectivity with download speeds of up to 7.2Mbps. It also has a 1500mAh battery with quoted talk time of over 10 hours..

It also has a 1500mAh battery with quoted talk time of over 10 hours.. Nokia X and Nokia X+ hands-on Nokia X manual Nokia X benchmarks. Dimensions: 4.55 x 2.48 x 0.41 inches (115.5 x 63 x 10.4 mm). Weight: 4.54 oz (129 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Colors: Black, Yellow, Green, Blue, Red, White. Display Physical size: 4.0 inches. Resolution: 480 x 800 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Settings: ISO control, White balance presets. 864 x 480 pixels 30 fps. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 13.30 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 17.0 days (408 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 10.50 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. Data: HSDPA 7.2 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s.

Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. GPS, A-GPS, Cell ID, Wi-Fi positioning. Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Nokia’s weird foray into Android is the Nokia X , a small, affordable smartphone that uses Google’s mobile OS, painted up as though it were almost a Windows Phone software variant. It’s a strange beast, with a chunky candybar design that blatantly screams ‘Nokia,’ and a price tag aimed at emerging markets. There’s a good chance Microsoft will kill it as soon as it takes over Nokia’s hardware business ( now set for April ) but in the meantime, does the Nokia X offer users a way to claw back some of the market share they’ve given up to low-cost Android devices?. The Nokia X isn’t fancy, but it’s also not a bad-looking device by any means. It resembles many of other Nokia devices, with defined edges and a thicker case, plus a polycarbonate back that’s matte and smooth to the touch. The case manages to feel like a single-piece design despite the fact that the back is removable because the phone itself pops out from the wraparound cover, instead of having just simple back panel that snaps on and off like on similar phones from Samsung.. The Nokia X comes in a variety of colors, and as Nokia is prone to do, it executes well on the brighter range of the spectrum. The black version I managed to get my hands on is also good looking, though much more understated than its candy-coated cousins.. A weird feature of Nokia’s take on Android is the single capacitive button it uses, which is simply a back command. This is kind of like a Home button, but contextually aware, so that it goes back a screen no matter where you are, with exiting an app being the final step in any chain. Pressing it on the home screen brings up a Windows Phone-like linear list of recently opened apps, too.. The home screen itself takes cues from Windows Phone, with icons arranged in a tile-like multicolored array. The icons can be adjusted and reconfigured, and set to take up either a 2×2 or 1×1 spot in the grid, and there are widgets accessible to the home screen, too, including ones specific to Nokia and standard Android ones built into third-party apps. It’s a different take on Android to be sure, and a far cry from a stock experience, but it’s also a system that I find far preferable to most other OEM UI reconfigurations, including Samsung Touchwiz.. This phone isn’t the most cracking handset on the block, and if you’re used to a top-end device like the iPhone or latest Galaxy S, you’re going to notice sluggishness, especially when browsing media-rich content and websites, or even a homescreen with a lot of icons. But overall, the experience does alright with limited resources, and never manages to become genuinely frustrating.. In terms of the field of devices against which it competes (those in the $100 range off-contract), it’s much more of a standout, offering more than competent access to Facebook, the native web, Twitter and other Android standbys in a package that’s both slick and affordable.. The dual-sim Nokia X also offers the ability to change easily between networks, and it has tremendous stand-by battery life. You can have the thing idle for weeks at a time and it’ll still be ready to go when you need it, which is a key concern in markets where access to power might not always be possible. If you’re using the cellular network constantly, battery life dips quickly and falls far short of either the iPhone or any other flagship Android device, but for infrequent use, the Nokia X outperforms either.. One more really nice thing about the Nokia X: Notifications on the custom home screen, including a text-based summary. It’s something that’s still missing from stock Android, and it’s a welcome addition to this custom fork.. The Nokia X is a surprising bit of hardware, if you can put aside top-tier smartphone expectations and take it for what it is. It’s a good take on Android, and one that actually seeks to improve the experience, in addition to acting as a funnel for Microsoft’s line of mobile software and services. It might not be long for this world, but it also certainly doesn’t feel like a last-minute move Nokia made casually to just try a low-cost Android device before ceding its hardware business to Microsoft, either..

Nokia's first and possibly last attempt at Android. 4GB on-board storage with microSD card expansion. Available in a variety of colors including black, green, white, red, yellow and blue. The Nokia X was first announced at the annual Mobile World Congress in February 2014. Unlike Nokia's Lumia or Asha devices, the Nokia X runs on a customized version of Android. There's no Google services, but Nokia has created and curated its own Android app store specially for the Nokia X.. The future for the Nokia X line looks a little bleak, with Microsoft announcing a round of layoffs and that in the future the X line will be re-aligned as a low-end Windows Phone device.. Nokia X is both a phone and a family of phones. The 4-inch Nokia X is the base model, and there is also the Nokia X+ and the larger, 5-inch Nokia XL. All run similar hardware and the same software with a consistent experience across each.. The 4-inch Nokia X shapes up like this:. Nokia is taking itself down a new path in the lower end of the market with the Nokia X, but is it any good? Back on Feb. 24 at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, the press – including us – were gathered around the Nokia booth to listen to what Stephen Elop was about to introduce. What came after that was the Nokia X. (And its siblings, the better-spec'd Nokia X+, and the larger.... Nokia has stiff competition in the budget Android space for its first entrant, so how does the Nokia X stack up against the current king, the Moto G? In late 2013 Motorola knocked our socks off with the Moto G. What it delivered was a top of the line Android experience for not a lot of money. It changed the budget space for the better and set a new benchmark for how a cheap Android.... It's a Nokia, with Android, minus the Google Nokia made a big deal out of the Nokia X – and it's sibling products, the X+ and XL – back at Mobile World Congress, it's first foray into the Android world. But it's not exactly Android in the sense we're familiar with in these parts. Take out the Google and add in some square tiles and you're on the right track. Why the Nokia X family is bad for everyone. When you do a thing poorly, nobody benefits I've had a few days to digest the Nokia X product line announcement from early Monday morning. I've tossed things around in my head, trying to get a handle on what Nokia was trying to accomplish with the new products, what it means for both the Windows Phone and Android ecosystems. I've seen the horrible reaction from potential users on.... Nokia X to soon be rebranded as Lumia. In an email to Microsoft employees, CEO Satya Nadella announced that the software giant would trim its global workforce by 18,000 over the course of the year. The first batch of layoffs will begin later this year, and will see over 13,000 employees leaving the organization.

Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ hands-on: The devil is in the details. Nokia X review: What happens when Nokia makes an Android phone?. For a company now under Microsoft's rule , Nokia has serious grit. The phone maker announced an Android phone called the X just two months before completing its merger with Microsoft. Even more intriguing is the fact that this is no run-of-the-mill Android device: The X comes with a Windows Phone-like launcher, offers Microsoft services and will be sold for around $120 in developing markets. While it may not be a powerful smartphone, it has many unique qualities that help it stand out from the low-end crowd. What's it like, and should Microsoft invest in its success?. Gallery: Nokia X review | 31 Photos. Battery life is good for most tasks. For its price, the X has respectable features and good hardware. However, its confusing ecosystem and numerous performance issues make it hard to recommend over similarly priced budget phones.. The X doesn't stray from Nokia's signature design language. In fact, if I were to briefly see it in the wild (not knowing what it was), I'd easily confuse it for an Asha 500-series device. Just like the Ashas, the X has square corners, straight edges, a large bezel and a removable plastic back cover with a matte finish, although it lacks the transparent casing of the Ashas. My review unit is a white, dual-SIM Nokia X, but it also comes in black, blue, yellow, red and green.. Everything about the X looks and feels simple. A volume rocker and power button grace the right side, while a micro-USB port and 3.5mm headphone jack are located on the bottom and top, respectively. Keeping with Nokia's usual style, the left edge remains devoid of any buttons. And just like the Asha 503, the front of the X features only a capacitive back button and earpiece. It lacks a front-facing camera, and when you flip the phone over, you'll notice a rear 3.2-megapixel camera with no LED flash.. Fortunately, I had no problem holding the 4-inch, 10.4mm-thick device, although these days, such a handset is considered quite small. If you're coming from an Asha or older 3.5-inch iPhone, you'll likely appreciate the size of the device; just to put things in perspective, it's 5mm wider and 1mm thicker than the iPhone 4s. Nokia will come out with a 5-inch version of the device known as the XL in the near future, so hang tight for a little longer if you'd rather go with something bigger.. Because it's an inexpensive handset (it starts at $123 USD), the X was never intended to be a lavish device. It exists primarily to bring a modern smartphone OS to developing markets at a lower cost, so the specs are about as minimal as you can get these days. It comes with a low-power processor, WVGA display, limited internal storage (1.2GB user-accessible), small battery and so on. In other words, it's ideal as someone's first smartphone.. The X uses a 4-inch IPS LCD panel with WVGA (800 x 480) resolution. At a pixel density of 233 pixels per inch, the display is reasonable compared to other Android phones sold at around the same price. As expected from this kind of screen, the viewing angles are decent and whites are bright, but unfortunately, colors are unsaturated and there's a lot of light unnecessarily bleeding out from the sides of the display. Those rough patches aside, the screen is actually pretty good for such an inexpensive device.. For connectivity, the X is a basic, entry-level 3G device suited for developing markets, though it sports a limited number of frequencies. It comes with quad-band GSM/EDGE and dual-band (900/2100) HSPA, which maxes out at 7.2 Mbps down and 5.76 Mbps up. You'll also get WiFi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 3.0 and GPS.. The one area of the X that should appeal to both power users and first-time smartphone buyers alike is the firmware. In short, it's unlike anything anyone has ever seen. Since the X is positioned between Nokia's Lumia series and the Asha lineup, it's not surprising that it uses a proprietary interface that takes elements from both devices, even though it technically runs on Android AOSP (version 4.1.2, to be exact). This means you can still use most apps, widgets and launchers supported on the platform, but just like on many Chinese devices running Android, you won't have access to Google Play Services like Gmail, Contacts, Calendar and so on.. The default launcher on the X is tile-based, much like Windows Phone. The tiles can even be resized -- two different options are available -- and you can change the color of each one to fit your own way of organizing the phone. There's enough space for three small tiles, or one large and one small tile, if you prefer. However, this system differs from Windows Phone in that Live Tiles aren't supported, so most tiles don't change at all when you make them larger (only specific ones, such as the gallery, add more functionality to the tile when enlarged).. You won't have access to a standard Android app tray, but you can create folders if you like to download a bunch of apps. This action is done by long-pressing any tile, which also allows you to move apps around and add widgets at your leisure.. There are plenty of other gestures that you'll need to learn as well. Tugging down on the launcher brings up a search bar (think Spotlight for iOS 7). Swiping down from the top opens up a type of quick-settings menu, which shows toggle switches for connectivity and music, as well as a list of devices or networks you're connected to. There's also a shortcut to your settings. Swiping up from the bottom reveals a menu that corresponds with whatever app you're using.. Gallery: Nokia X Android screenshots | 44 Photos. Using Android on the X Camera Performance and battery life The competition Wrap-up. Finally, a swipe to either the left or right brings up the Fastlane. This is a feature carried over from Asha (you can even trace its roots back to MeeGo), and it serves as Nokia's version of the notification menu. It shows recently opened apps, notifications, alarms and your current music selection. Some alerts, such as texts and calls, are actionable, so you can respond to them within Fastlane itself; if you want to clear out your alerts, you can do it individually or all at once. You can also customize the list so unwanted items are filtered out. (Pro tip: Tapping the back button from the home screen will take you to Fastlane as well.). There's also a special lock screen that shows your recent notifications. Swipe left on an individual alert to remove it, or swipe right to jump directly into that app. You can also swipe up from the bottom to clear them all out, if you don't want several notifications taking up all your screen space.. Just like on Nokia's latest Lumia devices, the X features a Glance screen that lets you view the date, time and symbols for each type of notification awaiting you. Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't. Additionally, you can double-tap on the screen to wake it, but I couldn't get this to work very consistently. Unlike most Android devices, which offer reasonable multitasking options, the X is much more restrictive. You can only get to the Fastlane from the home screen, which means you can't multitask without exiting your current app completely.. Nokia doesn't bombard you with Microsoft services, but it does make them more readily available than, say, their Google equivalents. Skype is preloaded, but you can also get OneDrive and Outlook in the Nokia Store. Curiously, it almost feels like the company wants to avoid looking like it's blatantly pushing Microsoft products, even though that's exactly what it's trying to do.. That doesn't mean Nokia's avoided bloatware altogether, however. You'll still get too many preloaded apps: Opera browser, WeChat, Viber, BBM, Nokia MixRadio, Here Maps and 10 games. Many of them can be uninstalled, aside from the Nokia-branded offerings. Most core apps -- dialer, messaging, calendar, camera, alarms, internet, music and email, for instance -- were made by Nokia, and are thoughtfully designed. (I especially like the alarm, which was inspired by the MeeGo-based N9 .) Even the keyboard has a Nokia flair that offers neat swiping gestures.. The best part is: If you don't like Nokia's interface, no sweat -- just download a new launcher and use that as your default instead. I tried a few and each one made it feel like I was using a real Android device, but there are still some catches you should be aware of. Most importantly, Google Play Services aren't allowed on the X (without rooting, at least). This means you don't have the full suite of the company's services: Play Store, Music, Games, Calendar, Voice, Google+, Contacts -- the list goes on. Primarily, this is because Nokia wants to focus on selling Microsoft's offerings instead, including Skype, Outlook, OneDrive and so on. This is actually a good idea on Nokia's part, when you consider the first-time smartphone buyer (or anyone else who hasn't been fallen under Google's spell): If Windows Phone is too expensive, at least the X is a cheaper option that introduces users to Microsoft's ecosystem in a roundabout way. In theory, once consumers are able to buy fancier phones, they'd be more inclined to give WP a closer look because they're already tied into Microsoft services.. This kind of setup is enough to confuse most users. Along with this mix of Microsoft services, Windows Phone and Asha, the X is, at its core, an Android device. Thus, it supports most Android apps, but the means of obtaining those apps are not as cut and dry as they should be. The Nokia Store is the official place to go, but it doesn't offer the same library as the Play Store. Instead, Nokia curates apps: It invites developers to add lines of code that make their apps compatible with Nokia's special UI, and then submit their apps and wait for its approval. It's quite the process, and judging by the limited number of available apps in the Store, it seems that a lot of developers haven't bothered with it yet.. So what happens if the app you really want isn't in the Nokia Store? To Nokia's credit, the company's made it possible to download or sideload any app you want -- though it isn't easy. If you can't find the app you want in the Nokia Store, it suggests a list of third-party app stores for you to check out. Currently, it lists SlideME, Aptoide, 1Market and Yandex as options, and, by using this method, I was able to get the app I wanted around 95 percent of the time. Of the numerous searches I conducted, only a small handful produced no results. The problem is that it takes much longer to find the app you want (if you find it at all), and you have to go into individual stores if you're looking for an update. Lastly, you can load any APK file onto the phone via microSD and internet links, though you won't get updates unless you manually sideload them.. There isn't much to say about the fixed-focus 3.2MP camera. The pictures aren't fantastic (especially for Nokia), but it's not fair to hold such an inexpensive phone to standards set by fancier devices. Since the X is intended for many first-time smartphone users on a limited budget, this camera will fit their needs quite well. It's got a 1/5-inch sensor size and f/2.8 aperture lens, and Nokia even throws in a few manual settings to sweeten the deal, including ISO, white balance, exposure, sharpness and face detection.. Predictably, you're not going to get great images at night. The phone simply doesn't have the right specs to do low-light shots any justice. That said, the photos I took during the day actually looked about as good as one would expect from a camera like this; while the limited dynamic range and lack of autofocus make it difficult to have an enjoyable experience, I came away impressed by the color reproduction.. At such a low price point, the expectations for a phone's performance differ from that of a midrange or flagship model. The X comes with a 1GHz dual-core Cortex-A5 Snapdragon S4 Play, an Adreno 203 GPU and 512MB RAM (the X+ and XL will come with 768MB). In plain English, this means it's good enough to handle most basic phone functions, but it's geared toward first-time smartphone users and developing markets, and isn't meant to keep up with high-end, quad-core smartphones.. Looking at it from that point of view, I wanted to see a phone that's usable, responsive and consistent. I didn't expect it to make computations incredibly fast, nor did I need it to load games like Asphalt 8 on a dime. Still, it had to support all of the core apps and a few extras without crippling the user experience.. With these criteria in mind, the X has its share of good and bad traits. The mesh of various UI elements from different platforms will drive an Android aficionado nuts, but the X is also designed to keep things simple. As long as the user isn't venturing too far into the weeds (sideloading apps, for instance), it'll be easy enough for someone to figure their way around the phone. And while it may be a bit confusing for some, the learning curve and user experience are more reasonable than an Asha phone. In fact, as time goes by and the price of the X goes down, I wouldn't be surprised to see this series completely replace the Asha lineup.. However, it isn't a very responsive device. I noticed a lot of delays between my touch and the screen indicating that I'd done anything. There were plenty of times in which I had to repeat gestures over and over until it finally figured out what I wanted it to do. And at least a couple times a day, I long-pressed the back button to go to the home screen, only to be greeted by a lengthy pause and "please wait" message. I also noticed that the screen would randomly flash on and back off again, and it sometimes turned on in my pocket without being prompted (this caused frequent redials and misfiring emails to people I rarely talk to anymore). At times, notifications showed up later than they should have, and occasionally they didn't even show up at all.. Because of all this, I can't say that the X has consistency. Too often, I'd repeat the same action only to get different results. A handset that has a mind of its own isn't something I can tolerate in any phone, regardless of how much it costs. In addition, it was often a pain to get even the most basic services set up on the X.. Call quality is mediocre at best, as most of my conversations have been full of static and the other end of the line is typically muffled. Additionally, my experience connecting the X to Bluetooth devices was inconsistent. On the other hand, the meager 1,500mAh battery lasted longer in regular smartphone use than I would've expected, although processor-heavy tasks did worse. After a day of moderate use, my review unit still had 30 percent leftover, and light phone users should be able to squeeze out at least two or three days, if not more. The phone didn't fare well in our endless-video rundown test, making it only four hours before dying; in the X's case, this isn't so much an indicator of a horrible battery as it is the inability of the processor to handle such activities efficiently.. Pricing will vary depending on region, but the X officially retails for around $120. It's positioned between the higher-end Lumias and lower-end Ashas, although, as I mentioned earlier, I wouldn't be surprised to see the X make the Asha lineup irrelevant if it drops in price in the next couple years. Its current cost, however, is about the same as the Samsung Galaxy Star Pro , a comparable device with similar specs. The X has 3G support and a better camera, but it also has a confusing ecosystem based on Microsoft services; the Star Pro, on the other hand, has full access to Google services and features a more familiar TouchWiz interface. It's also uncertain what kind of support Nokia will offer the X now that it's officially under Microsoft's wings, so it may make more sense to go with something like the Star Pro, which has a more robust ecosystem.. On one hand, its brand-new acquisition just came out with a product running its competitor's OS; on the other, that same product might be key to gaining mindshare in developing markets, which is one of the bloodiest battlefields in mobile right now. It's hard to feel confident in the X's future because Microsoft may choose not to invest in the series, focusing resources on cheaper Windows Phones instead. Because of this uncertainty, the X needs to be an absolutely stunning device and a fantastic value if I'm going to recommend it -- and unfortunately, it's not.. For its cost, it has respectable features and solid hardware, but it doesn't have enough redeeming qualities to help it pull ahead of its competition. The specs are comparable to a sub-$150 Android smartphone. However, the ecosystem is more confusing and the performance doesn't quite meet my expectations for a budget device. Plus, who knows how long Microsoft will keep it around and update it? Nokia's still a trusted brand, and it'll get a lot of interest in developing markets regardless of the competition, but I was ultimately too frustrated to recommend this over other similarly priced models.. The X works better as a possible Asha replacement than a full-on smartphone experience, and perhaps that will happen in the next year or two. I'm more confident in the performance of low-end Windows Phones like the Lumia 520 than I am in comparable Androids, and a dual-SIM Lumia in this price range would be a much more compelling deal..

Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ hands-on: The devil is in the details. Hands-on with Nokia's X family of Android smartphones (video). A couple of years ago, we would've said that the day Nokia announced an Android device was the day Hades froze over. The hour has come , however, and it's only slightly chilly this morning. The Nokia X is the company's inaugural Android-based devices -- three of them, in fact -- although it's been tweaked a little bit to fit Microsoft's and Nokia's preferences. The devices are known as the X, X+ (pictured above) and XL (pictured after the break), each of which differed by only a small number of factors; and at a cost of 89 euros ($122) for the X, 99 euros for the X+ and 109 euros for the XL, the family fits roughly in-between the Asha and Lumia series in terms of pricing and functionality. The X will be available immediately in growth markets (sorry, enthusiasts in the US, Korea and Japan, it won't be heading to your neck of the woods through official channels), while the X+ and XL will come later in the second quarter and will come in white, black, cyan, green, red and yellow.. Gallery: Nokia X and X+ hands-on | 7 Photos. Gallery: Nokia XL hands-on | 16 Photos. On the outside, the X and X+ both look a lot like a 4-inch version of the Asha 503, with the same matte polycarbonate chassis but without the transparent crystallic case surrounding it. It's not too tiny that it disappears in your hands, but it's also not too big to be overwhelming (unless you love larger devices, that is). At 10.4mm thick, it's not an incredibly thin device but its smaller size helps ensure that it's still a comfortable fit. (The XL is 10.8mm thick and offers a 5-inch display with the same resolution and 5MP rear camera along with a 2MP front-facing camera; we'll have more impressions of the XL shortly.). The phone itself is certainly a basic device, and it shows on the hardware side: the X sports a 4-inch IPS LCD WVGA (800 x 480) display, 3MP fixed-focus camera, a 1GHz dual-core Snapdragon processor, 1,500mAh removable battery, 4GB of internal storage, a microSD expansion up to 32GB and 512MB of RAM; the X+, we're told, tacks on another 256MB of RAM and comes preloaded with a 4GB microSD card. For an inexpensive pair of devices destined for emerging markets, however, we doubt anyone will complain about the lack of premium specs. We've got a gallery of pics below, along with more of our impressions of the Android interface.. Of course, the most intriguing part of the device is the user interface itself. The X family uses a forked version of Android 4.1.2 that uses the standard AOSP but doesn't have access to Google's suite of services (such as the official Play Store, Gmail or other core apps). Nokia wants to ensure that the device is focused on Microsoft Cloud services such as Skype (the X will come with a free month of unlimited international calls), OneDrive and Outlook, and it also throws in features like Here Maps, MixRadio and so on. We imagine that putting the focus on these services was the only reason Microsoft would greenlight the project -- since this is destined for developing countries and emerging markets, it makes sense that Microsoft wants to get its foot into as many doors as possible.. So what does a Nokia Android UX actually look like in real life? Not surprisingly, it's a lot like Windows Phone. The X launcher consists of a series of neatly lined-up tiles, although it's possible to add folders if you're overwhelmed by apps. Nokia claims that the X reflects the company's design heritage, and we have to agree -- despite its Android framework, it looks and feels very much like a Nokia device. The X also features a menu off to the side called Fastlane (which will be a familiar term for N9 and Asha users), which is the X's version of a notification menu and logs your favorite/most-used apps, nearly all of your activities, open apps and background processes on the same page. It sounds like a cluster of madness, but the company fortunately kept it looking pretty clean.. Since Nokia's running the show for all of the core apps, none of them actually look like the way Google has intended. One of our favorite touches was the clock, which Nokia basically copy-and-pasted from the N9. It also includes a Nokia-designed keyboard which even includes swiping gestures (a la Swype or SwiftKey). Third-party app stores and a file manager are also pre-installed. And although it doesn't use the official Play Store, the X will come with the Nokia Store preloaded.. This Store is supposed to feature plenty of Android apps, but they're specially curated by the company. When asked how particular they are, reps just told us that it's made things easy for devs: it'll be a matter of slapping in a few lines of new code into the same APK as they use for the standard Android build, submitting it to Nokia and then finally getting certified by the company. But if the app you're looking for is nowhere to be found in the Store, a screen pops up with suggestions for other third-party app stores which should feature that particular title. Or, if that doesn't work, nobody will be able to stop you from sideloading APKs into the phone for your personal use. Since the Nokia UX is simply built on top of AOSP, reps tell us that anything that's possible within the AOSP is technically possible to do on the X (think launchers, ROMs, widgets and so on).. Will this version of Android get updated, though? It's never easy to say even for standard Android phones, much less one forked by Nokia. We're told that it will indeed be updateable (based on consumer need), and individual services can be updated as well; we'd like to give the company the benefit of the doubt, but the reality is that if it's not successful, there's nothing preventing Nokia from pulling the support plug.. Color us completely intrigued by the X. As long as you don't mind the user experience being kept under Nokia's control, it's definitely a fun phone to play with. We'll have to wait until our official review to offer a final judgment, but Nokia's new smartphone is fun, modern and colorful. We're still marveling that this kind of discussion is even taking place right now, but it's fantastic to see the "adventurous" side of both Microsoft and Nokia.

More proof, if proof were needed, that Android won the smartphone OS wars: Nokia, the former world No.1 smartphone maker and, nowadays, the primary OEM for Microsoft’s third-placed Windows Phone platform has just announced a new family of smartphones built upon the Android Open Source Project — confirming a slew of earlier rumours that Nokia was cooking up an Android device strategy.. The first device in Nokia’s Droidy new family was unveiled today at its Mobile World Conference press conference in Barcelona, with both the forthcoming family and this its debut member known as the Nokia X ( Update : Nokia also announced the Nokia X+: the same handset but with additional memory, (coming early Q2, for €99/$136); and the Nokia XL, a larger handset with a 5-inch display, also coming in early Q2 for €109/$150).. The twist is it doesn’t look like the standard icon-filled Android that the market is used to, being dressed up in a new Nokia UI.. “The Nokia X software platform is built upon AOSP, Android Open Source Project,” said Nokia’s. marketing director for its mobile phones division,. “What we’ve done is we’ve built the Nokia X software platform on standard Android open source, and then on top of that we’ve built the Nokia user experience layer — so the Nokia UI — so Fast Lane and the homescreen.. “The homescreen is tile-based, so it’s similar to a [Windows Phone-based] Lumia. It incorporates some elements of that — some limited live information into the tiles. We’ve also put in Nokia and Microsoft services.”. “The sub-$100 price range is a massive opportunity for us,” said Nokia’s outgoing CEO Stephen Elop, describing the range as a “different but complementary opportunity to introduce a new family that strengthens our affordable [devices] family”.. “The Nokia X takes people to Microsoft’s cloud, not to Google’s cloud,” he added.. The 4-inch wVGA, dual-core 1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon handset, which comes in Nokia’s now familiar spectrum of eye-arresting colours (including bright green, red and yellow) and also packs a 3MP camera, costs €89/$122 (excluding taxes & subsidies) — and is launching immediately, shipping as early as next week.. Nokia said it is planning a global rollout for the X but the initial focus will be on “key, fast-growing emerging markets” — including India, China, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Russia. Aka, markets where low cost Androids are already well established.. The Nokia X’s price-point undercuts the affordably priced. handset, for instance, a relatively recent Android that is also targeting emerging markets. But the handset still doesn’t go as low as scores of hyper budget Droids (sub-$50 handsets are big in Africa, for instance). So expect other handsets in the Nokia X family to look to squeeze the price-point further south.. The other twist here: no new Lumia smartphones being unboxed by Nokia, the only substantial Windows Phone OEM ,. at the world’s largest mobile devices conference.. What exactly is Nokia doing with Android? In a similar move to Amazon, with its Kindle Fire tablet interface (and — doubtless — with a future Kindle smartphone, should it launch one), it’s forked Android to build on top of Google’s mobile sprawl. This is a change in tack from Nokia’s previously attempts to compete with Android’s reach exclusively via (its own and others’) non-Android mobile platforms.. This change of direction comes despite Nokia preparing to imminently hand off its mobile-making division to Windows Phone OS maker Microsoft — a business division acquisition announced last September .. Ergo, Microsoft will soon be in the business of making Android phones.. So, yes, Android really did win the mobile OS wars. And yes Microsoft must have at least been comfortable with this Android device-making strategy — whatever Joe Belfiore said yesterday when put on the spot about Nokia Android phone rumours during a Q&A at. But there are of course plenty of ways to monetise on mobile — and controlling the dominant platform is just one of them.. (If you’re still scratching your head about the logic, here’s a primer in a prior post I wrote covering earlier rumours of the Nokia Normandy project, as the Android phone was then codenamed. Bottom line: Nokia X is a Trojan horse stuffed with Microsoft services, pushed inside Android’s app-rich empire.). From the mobile user point of view, the huge draw of a Nokia handset built atop Android is of course access to the Android app ecosystem — and the circa one million apps that brings — albeit, not via the mainstream Google Play gateway. Nokia X users get access to apps via a curated (and entirely freemium) Nokia Android app store, and via any other third party Android app stores they choose to dip into.. Nokia’s own low end mobile platforms have not been able to compete on the app numbers front with Android, nor, indeed, has Windows Phone, which still lags greatly in numbers and in getting hot new apps while they are still hot. So this is one way for Nokia to fight Android’s ecosystem dominance — by piggybacking on it.. It’s worth noting that not all Android apps will be compatible with Nokia X, though. Nokia claims 75% of Android apps will work “out of the box”, and it’s hoping to persuade developers to make the necessary API tweaks to the remaining quarter (thanks to factors such as Nokia promoting in-app purchases via its Android app store, and its operator billing agreements with 160+ carriers globally which it argues will help developers expand monetisation opportunities for apps in emerging markets where phone users may not have credit cards, for example).. One high profile Android app that will be in the Nokia store at launch is SwiftKey .. startup said today it has signed a deal with Nokia for its next-word predicting. keyboard software to be a free download to Nokia X users for the duration of 2014. The SwiftKey app will be available to Nokia X users in 21 markets, including China, India and Nigeria. SwiftKey said the partnership will give it the chance to speed up its growth in emerging markets.. Nokia said its thinking for the X family is to act as a “feeder” to its full-fat Lumia smartphones, i.e. when owners of these cheaper smartphones upgrade to more expensive handsets. Because Nokia has dressed Android in Windows Phone clothes, and stuffed it with Nokia and Microsoft services — such as HERE maps, Microsoft’s OneDrive, SharePoint and Outlook.com.. The gamble here is that users will be better convinced to switch platforms from Android to Windows Phone than they have already — and when they can afford such an upgrade — once they have become. accustomed to the Nokiasoft services the Nokia X Android flavour is laced with. So this is Mix Radio and HERE’s offline maps being used as gateway drugs to Windows Phone.. “The Nokia X family… acts as the perfect feeder to our Lumia high end smartphone family, which is very much our premium and our flagship family,” Broadley told TechCrunch.. “Whether it’s the signature Nokia experiences like Mix Radio and HERE, whether it be Microsoft experiences, like OneDrive, Outlook.com, or Skype, you’re going to be using your Microsoft cloud identity, your Microsoft login, and also in terms of our user experience [with Nokia X]… we’re using elements of the [Windows Phone style] tile-based interface… so that when people in time continue to upgrade within the Nokia family we’re continuing to build richer experiences,” he added.. did not say this is Microsoft and Nokia admitting mainstream platform defeat with Windows Phone, but there certainly seems to be a strong thread of a plan B strategy here, that’s focused on acquiring users of mobile services, rather than relying on making money by flogging phone hardware. And with Nokia only shipping some 30 million Lumia devices in the whole of 2013 that diversification seems prudent.. As well as not looking like a typical Android, and not including the standard Android swathe of Google services (such as the Play Store, Google Maps, Gmail and so on), the Nokia X software platform also replaces three Android APIs to facilitate Nokiasoft hooking its own services in place: namely the location API (with Nokia’s HERE mapping services); the in-app purchase API (with Nokia’s own Android store offering); and the notifications API.. The latter tweak is required for the Nokia X to plug into Nokia’s Fast Lane. notifications interface — which it’s porting over from its S40-based Asha range of low end devices, where the interface debuted in May last year. 2012 acquisition of Smarterphone , a Norwegian company that made mobile OSes for feature phones designed to give them smartphone looks and capabilities).. There is a quiet irony in that feature phone software getting a new lease of life on a smartphone platform that’s itself dressed in the clothes of another mobile OS.. Even more at the low end. Nokia’s range of Series 40 Asha phones already straddle the price-point and functionality gap between fully-fledged budget smartphones and very basic feature phones. But today’s Android foray does not mean Nokia is discontinuing its use of S40.. On the contrary, also today it announced a new device in the Asha range: the Nokia Asha 230.. This becomes the new most affordable handset in the Asha range — costing €45/$62 Euros (excluding taxes & subsidies).. Nokia also unveiled a new addition to its bottom of the range web accessing feature phone devices (which run the S30 platform), with the Nokia 220 — the replacement for the Nokia 110. The Nokia 220 costs €29/$40 (before taxes & subsidies), and comes preloaded with Facebook and Twitter, with Nokia describing it as its most affordable “Internet connected device”.. This handset will also use Bing search as the default in markets where that Microsoft service is rolled out, keeping the Nokiasoft services strategy on message — even here at the truly budget end of its device portfolio.. Yet among all this non-Android low-end action, there is still apparently room for the Nokia X family — with Nokia’s new price-point increments being circa $40 (S30); $60 (S40); $120 (Android); and $180 (for its entry level Lumia 520 ) — which again underlines how successful Android’s platform reach has been.. It really is a case of if you can’t beat them, join them, fork them — and then try to beat them on kick-ass services.. One more thing: it’s unclear exactly how long this Android-plus-Nokiasoft services strategy has been in the works at Nokia — TechCrunch asked, but the company declined to comment. Nokia did claim the idea to build atop Android as its own though, rather than something that came out of Redmond..

The Nokia X is the first phone made by Nokia to use the Android operating system. It’s out to win over a new audience of people who after a true low-cost smartphone. It costs 90 Euros – probably roughly the same amount in pounds – has a 4-inch screen and a brand new interface that looks nothing like normal Android. But is it any good? I had a closer look at MWC 2014 .. Watch our video of the Nokia X:. It may be totally different from Nokia’s Lumia phones in most respects, but the X stays true to the Lumia series’s colourful design. The phone comes in yellow, blue, green and red as well as black and white.. It’s a chunky little boxy phone – 10.4mm thick – that could pass for a Lego mobile. Like Nokia’s cheaper Lumia phones, the Nokia X has a removable plastic rear that gives access to the two micro SIM card slots. This is a phone with emerging markets in mind, and that’s why it offers dual SIMs.. There’s also a microSD memory card slot, which is a must as the phone only has 4GB of internal storage.. Hardware isn’t the interesting thing about the Nokia X, though. The Nokia X runs a heavily customised version of Android 4.1, and it looks nothing like normal Android. Instead, it borrows heavily from Windows Phone, using a home screen of tiles that show everything on your phone. There are no traditional Android home screens here.. I’m not totally convinced by this new interface, though – it seems to have too much potential to become a cluttered mess, even if it does support folders. Some of the app tiles are ‘live’ too, meaning they relay information rather than just acting as a link, but it isn’t as well executed as Live Tiles are in Windows Phone. It’s early days, however, and hopefully Nokia will tweak the interface in future updates.. There’s another side of the interface too. Fastlane is a scroll of your recently-used apps and phones features – the music player, for instance. This part of the phone seems to be there to help out if your Nokia X home screen gets that bit too cluttered. For a budget phone, though, the Nokia X has a reasonable amount of screen real estate. It’s a 4-inch display of 480 x 800 resolution – the same as budget Lumias like the Lumia 520 and Lumia 620.. Although clearly an entry-level screen, without the top-notch contrast of Nokia’s more expensive phones, it’s not bad. This is an IPS-type screen, offering better viewing angles than some other cheap phones.. However, it’s not a patch on the Moto G ‘s much sharper 720p screen..

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. The Nokia also misses out in one other crucial respect – apps. There are none of Google’s much-loved apps here, and there’s no Google Play app store.. Instead, the Nokia X offers a bunch of Nokia and Microsoft apps, such as the Here navigation suite and OneDrive online storage. You also get a handful of other pre-installed apps including BBM and Skype.. Casual users may be happy, and you can sideload your own apps, but even Nokia admits that its fledgling Nokia Android app store won’t offer a full and complete selection. It will even suggest third-party app stores should you not be able to find what you’re after. Nokia will doubtless argue that third-party alternatives are a good replacement, and that its library is growing fast. But budget Androids are already prolific, so there seems little reason to excuse the Nokia X.. Performance isn’t likely to be all that great once you fill up the phone’s memory either. The dual-core 1GHz is reasonable for an entry-level phone, but with just 512MB a bit of lag is likely. I didn’t notice anything catastrophic during a brief play with the phone, though, and the Nokia X Plus offers 768MB RAM for a performance boost – and only costs £10 more.. The camera too is extremely basic, with a fixed focus 3-megapixel sensor and no flash. However, I still can’t quite give up the cute factor. and feels a whole lot better than the majority of budget Androids, and. while it’s quite limited in some crucial respects I still find myself. wanting to try one out properly.. The Nokia X is most exciting because of its Android software. However, it’s the design and hardware we like most here, as the limited app support and potentially niggly software need a bit of time to develop.. Next, read more about MWC 2014.

Nokia's Android ambitions have come to fruition and if you want to see what we think so far you can head straight on over to our hands on reviews of the Nokia X , Nokia X+ and Nokia XL .. If you fancy getting to know the trio of handsets at once, stick around and we'll reveal the specs, the design, the release dates and the price of each of these unusual handsets.. It started out as a pie-in-the-sky rumour: Nokia is making an Android device. Surely not, given the Finnish firm has only recently been acquired by software giant (and the Windows Phone peddling) Microsoft. So why would Nokia jump into bed with the enemy?. While many eyebrows were raised, and eyes rolled, when news of the Nokia X first took to the web (under the moniker Normandy), the sheer deluge of leaks added more and more credibility to the handset's existence.. And then it was made official. At MWC 2014 , Stephen Elop took to the stage to announce the arrival of the Nokia X, X+ and Nokia XL .. The Nokia X and Nokia X+ are bedfellows – all that separates them are the amount of RAM they have.. The Nokia X has just 512MB, while the Nokia X+ has a slightly more generous 768MB and comes with a 4GB microSD card in the box. As for the Nokia XL, this is a low-cost phablet with a 5-inch screen.. Nokia's first smartphone to run Google's Android OS. Now, in selected markets (Nokia X+ and XL arrive soon). It's cheap: €89, €99 (X+) and €109 (XL). Announced on February 24, the Nokia X was revealed by Stephen Elop, who said that the new device was indeed Android but with a difference. "The Nokia X is built on Android open source software. We have differentiated and added our own experience," he said.. We did learn that the Nokia X would be launched first, and cost just €89 (around £75, $120, AU$135). It's now on sale in India for Rs8599, which equates to around £85, and is available in Kenya for roughly the same price too.. The Nokia X+ and Nokia XL will be arriving in selected markets during the second quarter of the year for €99 (around £80, $135, AU$150) and €109 (around £90, $150, AU$170) respectively.. While these devices will come to more developed markets in the future, we're still waiting for Nokia to outline its exact launch plans for places like the UK and US.. We got hands on with the Nokia X+ at MWC 2014:. The single biggest feature on the Nokia X (X+ and XL) is its operating system. Nokia is heavily invested in the Windows Phone platform for its Lumia range, while its Asha devices run its own, in-house Asha OS.. The Nokia X range runs Android. But not the Android you know (and perhaps love). This is a heavily modified version that is built on Android open source software, although it does use Android Jelly Bean 4.1.2 as the base.. This isn't an Android that comes with the Google Play store. This is an Android that has been moulded and contorted into an operating system that runs and looks more like Windows Phone.. There are live tiles just like Windows Phone, but you will be able modify the handset a little more freely than on Windows Phone.. Essentially it marries the design language of Windows Phone to the more open nature of Android with a touch of Asha thrown in for good measure.. For example its uses a version of the Asha "Fast Lane" feature, which shows all your recent activity, from new messages to the last apps you used and it can be customised to hide specific information so it only shows you what you want to see.. Nokia has put its own Android store on to the device (giving you a more limited selection than Google Play) and there will be a number of apps pre-installed on to the device.. Unsurprisingly these are mostly Microsoft ( OneDrive , Skype etc) and Nokia (HERE Maps, HERE Drive and Mix Radio) offerings - with some apps only available on the Finnish firm's version of Android.. This is definitely a forked version of Android with Elop noting that the Nokia X takes people to Microsoft's cloud and not Google's.. The lack of Google Play could be a major stumbling block for the Nokia X and its brethren as Nokia's own store is likely to be comparatively lacking for a long time to come.. But you can also use third party app stores and Elop does say that Android devs can bring their apps to Nokia X - it only takes a few extra hours dev work - and people can sideload applications using a microSD card.. The fact that porting apps is so easy also means that the Nokia X range could quickly end up with a greater selection of them than any Windows Phone handset, even if it's not likely to deliver the full library of Android apps.. Enterprising users needn't be limited at all as the Nokia X has already been hacked to run Google Play and Google apps.. Next Page Nokia X screen, design and past rumors. Nokia X release date and OS.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery and Conclusion. posted by Chris P.. Nokia - Nokia + Android - Android +. 4 Call Quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction One of the forefathers of the modern phone industry, Nokia is revered by many to this day for the level of build quality of its devices, and yet that didn't help the company when it was caught off guard by the stratospheric surge in demand for smartphones. Many thought that the Finnish company made all the wrong decisions, especially when it decided to go for an infant of an operating system in Windows Phone. The thought of what Nokia could have been like if it instead at least had hedged its bets, and adopted Android as well, is still stuck at the back of the heads of many industry watchers, not to mention fans. We won't be having a miraculous remake of history today – it's too late for that – but we all finally have the opportunity to see what Nokia hardware powered by Android feels like. With its X-line, Nokia surprised many by finally seeing fit to experiment with Android, though hardheaded as the company is, this is still a fork of the platform. The 4-inch, dual SIM entry-level Nokia X that we'll be looking at today, then, comes with all the signature Nokia services like its app store and HERE Maps, but none from Google. There's no Play Store, no Google Maps, and many, many more. And while there's a degree of inter-compatibility (ergo, normal Android apps will usually run just fine on the Nokia X's software), it's still a halfhearted stab at the world's most popular mobile OS. Is that necessarily a bad thing? We were very intent on finding out and share our impressions with you, so keep on reading. In the box: A power plug with a permanently-attached microUSB cable Headphones Design The Nokia X borrows inspiration heavily from the Lumia 525 and Asha 503 – the X is a typical rectangular slab with sharper-than-average corners and excellent build quality Whether it's because it is a near-flawless look-alike to the latest Asha 503 , or because the Asha, in turn, draws inspiration from Nokia's Lumia 520 / 525 , we felt like we knew the Nokia X from the get-go. The X inherited the singular capacitive 'back' button from the the Asha line, and the rectangular frame with its moderately sharp edges. The removable rear shell is made of solid matte plastic, same as the buttons on the right side of the X. Both the volume rocker and the power key provide profound feedback, and there's a nice amount of travel to them. Handling the Nokia X is easy – the small device is perfect for one-handed use – but we couldn't shake off the feeling that we're using a toy phone. And it's not just the jubilant palette of color options – it's also the profoundly plastic, but very solid exterior that made us feel like we're operating a reinforced, child-proof piece of hardware. On the bright side, while there's no arguing this looks and feels like an entry-level device, the overall build quality is impressive. Display Reflective, dim, and completely off when it comes to proper color reproduction When looking at the 4-inch 480x800 pixel resolution IPS display on the Nokia X, the results speak for themselves, and align very well with our initial impressions. For starters, this isn't the sharpest panel out there, though at 233ppi, we didn't find much reason for complaint. But it's in color reproduction that the panel totally disappoints – it's got a very cold color temperature of 9320K, resulting in a noticeably bluish fringe throughout. This problem is especially noticeable when the display has to render differing shades of gray. But that's not all – specific colors, like magenta and cyan, are seriously messed up. Greens and reds are also problematic. Worse yet, the display isn't very bright, managing 359 nits at its very best. This, combined with the highly reflective glass on top of the display, amounts to a frustrating outdoors viewing experience. It's also relatively bright even at the lowest setting, meaning that usage in complete darkness may tire out your eyes quickly..

To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The numbers below represent the amount of deviation in the respective property, observed when a display is viewed from a 45-degree angle as opposed to direct viewing.. Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Image: 1 of 3.

Making a test device and see if there will be market for them, I'll give you that Nokia. But putting a crappy camera like that, you are just ruining your image as the camera king of the smartphone world. (Posts: 5787; Member since: 16 Mar 2013). posted on 17 Apr 2014, 08:19. Why Nokia would use a Cortex-A5 CPU for their first run with an Android type phone is beyond me. In fact every WP from them has always has a much higher class CPU. The other thing is who cares what Ghz or the number of cores are in this CPU, or the fact that it came from Qualcomm. Its still a Cortex-A5 class CPU. Don't get me started on the 512Mb of ram this thing has, or the 4Gb of storage, or the camera at 3mp with no flash, an what a front facing camera (lack there of). This thing should have never made it to the drawing board. Let alone calling itself an Android phone with no normal Google apps and services. Things that most normal people associate when actually using an Android phone. I wouldn't want to get the Nokia X wet. The moto g is a much better buy, and you are getting a much better phone compared to the Nokia X.. (Posts: 739; Member since: 17 Jan 2014). posted on 17 Apr 2014, 15:25. I am not surprised at all. I said from the beginning that this could only ever be an Asha replacement... all these Android fans day-dreaming of a Nokia Android flagship - it just was never going to be that way, ever. At best, Nokia X will become the new Asha. At worst, it just won't take off, and Asha devices will remain for a little while longer. Nokia really does need a replacement for Series 40 that they can actually call a "smartphone" OS without lying..

If storage is very-very important to you (although Moto G offers 65GB cloud storage with G Drive):. Moto G has water resistant coating. 1 GB ram (Nokia with only 512 ram, wth?!). Android 4.4 vs Nokia built on 4.2 (Also better support). (Posts: 853; Member since: 23 May 2012). posted on 17 Apr 2014, 08:08. i thought the x was built on 4.0?.

You are also missing the moto g can take slow motion videos, and if you want add more storage on the moto g, you can just go buy a USB otg cable for around $2-$5. Then you can use regular USB flash drives on the moto g. There is even more elegant ways to add more storage to Android like the Sandisk Connect, which was reviewed on phonearena.com.

Moto G and Lumia 520/525=charming affordable rich phone. This is like Galaxy Trend, cheap and average at best, but mostly crap. Actually Trend beats this some ways, especially with MUCH MUCH better app store and Google apps. (Posts: 2116; Member since: 30 Apr 2012). posted on 17 Apr 2014, 07:59. What's the point of this phone? A Lumia 520/521 would be better than this hunk of junk (and cheaper), and I'd never recommend a 520/521 to anyone that wasn't an enemy that I didn't want to suffer through the agony of using a mediocre Windows phone. WP's app selection might suck, but it's better than what this phone offers. If you want something cheap to hack and tinker with, pick up a used Galaxy Nexus or S2 for cheap, or spend a bit more for a Moto G. Hell, almost any 2 year old used or NOS phone would cost as much, yet be far better. If the reason to purchase this is because it supports dual sim, then this isn't my area of knowledge, but I'm sure there are better options than this (like the Sony E1).. (Posts: 2072; Member since: 24 Oct 2012). posted on 17 Apr 2014, 08:15. People should overlook this phone and consider the Lumia 525, which is overall a much better phone than this. If this phone would have ran WP, it would be fast and smooth, but it runs Android so.... (Posts: 1693; Member since: 18 Aug 2013). posted on 17 Apr 2014, 08:32.

"Sorry, this phone is crap, thanks to Nokia and M$". No, thanks to Elop and Microsoft. If Nokia was left independent, I guarantee you would have got a full Android experience on a 1020-like device.. (Posts: 5787; Member since: 16 Mar 2013). posted on 17 Apr 2014, 08:48. NokiaFTW now you are clearly showing the world you technical knowledge, or lack thereof. The Nokia X is using a Cortex-A5 CPU which is the bottom of the barrel, as far as ARM CPU's are concerned in todays world. Every WP uses a higher Cortex-A9 or above CPU. In fact WP never supported anything lower then a Qualcomm Cortex-A9 CPU.. (Posts: 739; Member since: 17 Jan 2014). posted on 17 Apr 2014, 15:43. And that is the point of this phone... it is too cheap to run Windows Phone. Android was the only smartphone OS option left that could be wrangled into something this underpowered. Now, that ought not to be a bad reflection on Android - Android is wonderfully scalable, made to suit a wide range of hardware, from the best of flagships to the cheapest of working garbage. In order to make this an Asha replacement, it had to come in at the cheapest end of the spectrum, and I'm still not convinced that it will work out for Nokia/Microsoft the way they wanted it to. It is still too expensive to be a better value than either a Moto G or a Sony Xperia E1, and still comes in at the high end of the cost curve when compared to an Asha device. For something that was supposed to be this 'cheap', it actually isn't inexpensive enough. The price needed to be sub-$100.. (Posts: 3689; Member since: 14 Feb 2014). posted on 17 Apr 2014, 10:28.

BASED ON 2,121 RATING(S). 13 Mar 2014 By Kaushik Somaiya On flipkart.com. First let me just swipe away those fools who are criticizing about nokia X. nnClaim 1 ) Nokia X is not pure android, Older version of android blah blah !!nnWait ... did you just said that ? Do you know the difference between various android versions ? I am not talking about interface and features difference. Nokia is a 1865 based company and have years of experience manufacturing phones. So whatever they do you gotta believe in them ! Crapsung and other crap companies have flooded the market and your minds as well with typical grid type icons interface Android mobiles. Whats the deal if Nokia just modified that for a new taste ?nnClaim 2 ) Nokia X uses older Adreno , Qualcomm processors blah blah !!nnOH please, you are not a m.tech in Micro processor. Do you know the architectural difference between older and newer processor ? nIt may be that this version of qual comm is enough for a 512 mb memory. We cant give any judgement until we do not know about the precise architectural differences between processors. nPerhaps India is a country where quantity is selected first rather than quality. Thats the biggest reason why brands such as Micromax have succeeded. People believe that higher processor frequency means higher performance !! Oh please , put on blankets and go to sleep. nnClaim 3) No Apps from Google Play store ! nnPlay store has innumerable developers around the world. You cannot dislike a phone just because it dont have a play store. Here also Quality vs Quantity arises. nPlay store gives quantity of apps including those which access you personal data, steal your private information, access your phone services, eats your battery, and also dares to display ads on their interface when data connection is on. nnClaim 4 ) Poor Camera , low end features blah blah !!nnWhen Samsung, Micromax, others.. says 5MP camera, they are just joking ! nWhen Nokia says 5MP, they actual mean it ! nThere is a quality in every component that nokia makes. nnEven the older Nokia 5230 smart phone gives superb quality videos with just 2MP camera vs the crap Samsung star pro 2MP camera. nnMoral : Dont look after quantity, always go for Quality. nnUPDATE: I dont owe Nokia X because i (will)have Nokia XL. But Recently i visited The Mobile Store shop and used the Demo piece. Let me tell you its really good. Especially the design , you will feel like keep looking at it. The built quality is so tough that you can throw it at some ones head and kill him. The screen is awesome even at such low resolution. The only issue was that the interface was lagging when we swipe the screen. The solution to that is go to settings and turn off the animation feature. Then it would be very fine. 7K is perfect price for this one. And the Camera even being just 3.15MP is exceptional. You can clearly read any thing small written in book or magazine. The fonts and graphics are very smooth and eye pleasing. 13 Mar 2014 By Dixit Mahajan On flipkart.com. Awesome Phone from Nokia now beware of chinese.

Nokia X, a historical device and best known as the first Nokia android phone. At the beginning of Nokia's research, the code name of this device was 'Normandy'. After several months of research and testing, Nokia announced it in February 24th, 2014 in the mobile world congress in Bercelona.. It is a very simple entry-level smartphone with some basic standard features like 3.15 MP back camera, dual-core processor, 1500 mAh battery, 512 MB RAM, 4 GB ROM, optional dual-SIM, 3G network etc. It doesn't contain any front camera for video calling which can be seen as a con. Other than that, there is also no Google service available in the phone, such as Google play store can't be accessible. Users can download Android apps from Nokia store instead. However, one can run play store in this phone by "rooting" the device. But this may cause some security issues.. User Rating: 3.76 ( 79 votes).

There was an error emailing this page.. The phone is the key to everything: Microsoft now owns Nokia's device business. Smartphone lull a golden opportunity for Microsoft. Cortana takes the spotlight as Microsoft updates Windows, Windows Phone, Office. Build 2015: Windows 10 in 3 minutes. Best of Nokia now at Microsoft New hardware? No comment. For better or worse, Stephen Elop, Microsoft’s new devices chief stuck to the script in introducing himself and Microsoft Mobile, which rose from the ashes of Nokia upon its acquisition from Microsoft.. Elop took to the pages of Nokia Conversations to address questions from the legions of Nokia fans in a Reddit-styled “Ask Me Anything” session that reiterated Microsoft’s commitment to its customers and Windows Phone platform. One revelation of note: The intriguing Nokia X Android phone will apparently be around for a while.. With the close of the Nokia deal last week , Microsoft will slowly begin integrating the tens of thousands of Nokia employees that the deal brought with it, and begin folding the Lumia brand, plus its development and design teams, into Microsoft proper. And that was Elop’s message Monday morning.. Case in point: The branding for the next Lumia. Elop said that, not unexpectedly, the existing branding could not remain the same—though neither "Nokia" nor the rumored "Microsoft Mobile" branding will be used for smartphones in the future.. “Now that we are One company, the marketing and product folks will lay in the plans for the shift to a consistent brand,” he wrote. “While we are not ready to share precise details, I can assure you that it will not be the ‘Nokia Lumia 1020 with Windows Phone on the AT&T LTE Network’ ... too many words! That somehow doesn’t roll off the tongue...”. Elop declined to address whether the 1020 would receive a true sequel, but said that Nokia’s imaging hardware would persist, as expected. “While I can’t comment on specific product plans, it is safe to say that imaging will continue to be an important differentiator for us in the future.”. Likewise, the apps and services that Nokia offered on the Lumia phone line will transfer to Microsoft. Elop wasn’t asked about, nor did he directly answer, what the future will be of the Windows Phone mapping application. Lumia phones use HERE Maps, the map technology that Nokia has licensed to Microsoft for four years .. “We have been building a lot of apps that have been specific to Lumia, but now those people and efforts will transfer to [Microsoft],” Elop wrote. “ We believe that these types of capabilities are critical to differentiation, so you will see these themes continue.”. Likewise, Elop wrote, phones like the well-regarded Lumia 1020 could have been pushed further if Nokia could have drawn on Microsoft’s talent. could have gone further if the engineering teams between [Microsoft] and Nokia were not in separate companies,” he wrote. “As we come together, innovation will be able to move faster.”. Elop did note, however, that it will continue to need the assistance of its developer community as well as its hardware partners. HTC said last week that its relationship with Microsoft remains unchanged. “It is GOOD for Microsoft to encourage other OEMs to also build [Windows Phone] devices, and there have been some announcements in this direction recently,” Elop wrote. “Our intent is for the Microsoft Devices Group to ‘make the market’ so that others can participate, so we will be doing things to facilitate other OEMs as much as possible.”. Given that the session took place on a Nokia blog, Elop wasn’t publicly asked about—nor did he answer—questions about Microsoft’s other hardware efforts, namely the Surface tablet and the Xbox. The closest he came was when he addressed a question about the integration of the various platforms.. Will the Surface eventually morph into a Lumia tablet?. “I think that people are looking for and deserve a consistent and continuous experience across their different devices and platforms,” Elop wrote. “A good example of this today is OneDrive, where I have consistent access to my stuff across all of my devices. Elop did, however, endorse the Nokia X, the Android-powered phone which connects to a variety of Microsoft services. Alhough the Nokia X appears to have been a modest success, it will apparently live on.. “Microsoft acquired the mobile phones business, inclusive of Nokia X, to help connect the next billion people to Microsoft’s services ,” Elop wrote. “Nokia X uses the [Microsoft] cloud, not Google’s. This is a great opportunity to connect new customers to Skype, outlook.com. and OneDrive for the first time. We’ve already seen tens of thousands of new subscribers on [Microsoft] services.”. And as for the colorful Nokia Lumia design scheme? That apparently won’t go away, either. “I’m pretty sure you will see this ‘colorful’ personality transcend into Microsoft,” Elop wrote, noting that employees dressed in Lumia colors on Monday morning.. Left unsaid was whether or not Microsoft’s Xbox would be done up in Lumia yellow, the fate of a Surface phone , or how Microsoft plans to further address the post-PC world. On the last issue, Elop issued an arguably more provocative statement about Microsoft’s future as part of a press release.. “The vast majority of people do not have, nor will they ever have a personal computer,” Elop said. “They haven’t been exposed to Windows or Office, or anything like that, and in their lives it’s unlikely that they will. And yet through the mobile phone business we have an opportunity to introduce what we like to call the next billion people, the next billion people to connect to the Internet, to Microsoft, because they’ll have an opportunity perhaps to have a first Skype experience, or a first experience with Bing, as an example.”. Elop’s had months to consider his new role at Microsoft. In his defense, however, Elop’s first priority is most likely operational, ensuring that the new business unit docks into the Microsoft mothership. Over time, however, we can hope that we’ll hear a bit more substance.. To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed..

Nokia X – Sự kết hợp hoàn hảo của công nghệ. Màn hình đẹp, góc nhìn rộng. Hệ điều hành Android nhưng có bộ mặt hoàn toàn mới. Mượt mà trên từng cử chỉ. Nokia , một hãng điện thoại từng giữ vững ngôi vương trong khoảng thời gian dài trên thị trường điện thoại di động toàn cầu, sau sự phân loại mạnh mẽ của thị trường điện thoại di động , Nokia vẫn đứng vững và càng mạnh mẽ hơn.. Trải qua một thời gian dài, Nokia lại mang đến một niềm vui lớn dành cho fan trung thành của mình với sự ra mắt đầy ấn tượng của dàn smartphone chạy Android, mở ra một kỷ nguyên mới dành cho Nokia.. Nokia X là một đại diện ưu tú với rất nhiều điều khiến người dùng tò mò. Sản phẩm sử dụng hệ điều hành Android 4.1. của Google tuy nhiên nó được thiết kế theo phong cách riêng của Nokia, ngoài ra bên trong máy trang bị chip xử lý Qualcomm Snapdragon S4, màn hình IPS 4 inch cùng khả năng nhắn tin, gọi điện bằng hai sim .. Nokia X mang đến nhiều điều bất ngờ khi sử dụng hệ điều hành. Nokia X được thừa hưởng nhiều từ phong cách thiết kế của dòng Lumia và Asha , vẫn phong cách sặc sỡ đầy màu sắc của Nokia. Sản phẩm có thân hình vuông vắn, chắc chắn và rất trẻ trung, chất liệu nhựa cao cấp Polycarbonate vẫn được hãng này ưu ái sử dụng và nó chiếm được nhiều cảm tình của người dùng, cảm giác cầm trên tay khá là thích. Sản phẩm có độ mỏng là 10.4mm và trọng lượng là 128.7 g, cho cảm giác cầm chắc và đầm tay, bạn cũng có thể thoải mái cầm, sử dụng hoặc đút túi dễ dàng thiết bị này.. Ngoài ra Nokia X còn được giới thiệu với rất nhiều màu sắc mang những cá tính riêng, người dùng có thể thoải mái lựa chọn cho mình một màu nổi bật nhất hoặc thích hợp với mình nhất.. Nokia X rất thoải mái khi cầm và sử dụng. Chất lượng màn hình của Nokia X khá ấn tượng, dù kích thước 4 inch , thuộc dòng máy giá rẻ tuy nhiên sản phẩm được trang bị tấm nền IPS, cho hình ảnh trong, sáng và góc nhìn rất rộng.

Cùng với giao diện dạng ô vuông và khả năng tùy biến cao, trên màn hình 4 inch này bạn hoàn toàn có thể tự sắp xếp được một màn hình gọn gàng và ưa nhìn cho riêng mình. Với chiếc màn hình này và trong mức giá này không thể chê được điều gì về “mặt tiền” của Nokia X cả.. Chất lượng màn hình tốt cho bạn những trải nghiệm ấn tượng hơn. Không thể phủ nhận được sự hấp dẫn của Android và Nokia cũng muốn thử sức trên hệ điều hành này, tuy nhiên thay vì sử dụng hoàn toàn hệ điều hành của Google, Nokia sử dụng Android 4.1 nhưng lại trang bị giao diện giống như Windows Phone kết hợp cùng nền tảng Nokia X mà Nokia phát triển. Không giống như trên các sản phẩm Android thông thường, trên Nokia X bạn sẽ thấy một giao diện rất trực quan, dạng ô vuông có thể tinh chỉnh, thay đối kích thước, vị trí một cách dễ dàng.. Giao diện dạng ô vuông tương tự như trên các smartphone Windows phone. Ngoài ra thay vì sử dụng 3 nút cảm ứng như trên Android thì hãng điện thoại Phần Lan này lại sử dụng chỉ một nút cảm ứng phía dưới màn hình có cả chức năng của phím Back và phím Home. Đặc biệt hơn Nokia X không hỗ trợ sử dụng các dịch vụ của Google như trên smartphone Android, mà Nokia phát triển riêng kho ứng dụng của mình tương tự như trên Play Store của Android với rất nhiều ứng dụng, game đã có sẵn, dịch vụ lưu trữ Nokia sử dụng OneDrive, ngoài ra còn hỗ trợ. các dịch vụ khác của Microsoft như Outlook, Skype, MixRadio và bản đồ Here.. Bên cạnh đó Nokia X cho phép bạn truy cập ứng dụng yêu thích nhanh chóng và dễ dàng với Fastlane. Chỉ có trên Nokia, ứng dụng này hiển thị các ứng dụng, hình ảnh, các cập nhật Facebook gần đây và mọi thứ bạn yêu thích đều được sắp xếp đầy đủ trên một màn hình.. Một hệ điều hành mới rất đáng khám phá. Phần cứng bên trong Nokia X được đầu tư khá tốt với bộ xử lý hai nhân nổi tiếng Snapdragon S4 hỗ trợ RAM 512MB và có khe cắm thẻ nhớ ngoài. Cấu hình này có thể đảm nhiệm tốt công việc lướt web, cập nhật mạng xã hội, chơi các game mini hoặc các game giải trí nhẹ, cùng với pin dung lượng đến 1500mAh bạn có thể sử dụng thoải mái đàm thoại cùng với mạng 3G với thời lượng lên đến 10 giờ đồng hồ.. Giao diện của máy trong quá trình sử dụng không hề có hiện tượng lag hoặc giật, bạn có thể dễ dàng tùy chỉnh, thêm hoặc sửa giao diện một cách dễ dàng, ngoài ra bạn cũng có thể download về máy và sử dụng các ứng dụng phổ biến nhất hiện nay như Facebook, Skype và nhiều game đang gây sốt khác tương tự như trên smartphone Android.. Đa dạng tính năng và ứng dụng. Camera là chi tiết không thể thiếu trong tính năng giải trí của smartphone, sản phẩm có camera 3MP ở phía sau, có tốc độ chụp nhanh và bố trí danh mục các chế độ chụp một cách trực quan, dễ sử dụng. Nếu điều kiện ban ngày sản phẩm sẽ cho bạn những bức ảnh không thể tốt hơn, các chi tiết ảnh được hiển thị rõ ràng, màu sắc rực rỡ.. Nokia X là cái nhìn mới hướng về phía trước, mang theo niềm khát vọng đến chân trời mới của nhà sản xuất đầy kinh nghiệm đến từ Phần Lan. Sản phẩm được kết hợp khá nhiều các yêu tố từ hệ điều hành Android, nền tảng Nokia X và giao diện của Windows Phone, các yếu tố này đã tạo ra một sản phẩm đầy hấp dẫn, kết hợp với kinh nghiệm thiết kế của Nokia, sản phẩm hứa hẹn mang đến những điều bất ngờ ở phía trước..

The Nokia X is the company s first Android smartphone offering, and it was released years after consumers started demanding an Android smartphone from Nokia. However, it turned out to be completely different from what consumers and experts expected. It runs a completely customised version of Android v4.1.2 Jelly Bean that integrates Microsoft s services. It features a 4.0-inch IPS LCD display, a 3.15-megapixel camera, a 1GHz dual-core processor, 512MB RAM, 4GB storage unit, storage expansion slot, and a 1,500 mAh battery.. The device, which is made up of colourful polycarbonate material, follows the popular design principle of Lumia devices with some slight changes as the corners are relatively sharper. The front of the device is fairly simple the display, a physical back button, the company s logo, and an earpiece. Both, the power key and the volume rocker are present on the right hand side of the device. The microUSB port as at the bottom and the auxiliary headphone jack is at the top of the device. The whole back panel wraps around the display, and is removable as it has to be used for accessing SIM card slot, memory card slot, and the removable battery. The device s dimensions are 115.5 x 63 x 10.4 mm and it weighs 128.7 grams. It is available in six colours black, cyan, green, red, white, and yellow in India.. The IPS LCD display is diagonally 4-inches long and has a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels, resulting in 233 pixels per inch of sharpness. Surprisingly, this two-point multitouch capacitive display is not covered by strengthened material. There s only one camera on the Nokia X, even though all its competitors come with two cameras. The camera has a resolution of 3.15 megapixels, but it lacks autofocus as well as LED flash. Needless to say that it can t record videos in HD resolution. The 1/5-inch camera sensor supports face-detection and panorama modes however.. Nokia s custom UI that is used in this smartphone is known as Nokia X Platform. The device comes with Nokia X Platform 1.0 out of the box that is based on Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean, but it can be upgraded to Nokia X Platform 1.1.2.2 through a software update. The whole UI is inspired by what they call FastLane and Windows Phone. There s no home screen to speak of as the application launcher is divided into two parts; an app cum widget launcher and a section that merges notifications and open apps. The app launcher looks similar to the Start Screen from Microsoft s Windows Phone operating system as the icons appear like Live Tiles. Nokia X Platform is now defunct.. The Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Play (MSM8225) manages the show with its 1GHz dual-core Cortex-A5 CPU, Adreno 203 GPU, and 512MB RAM. There s 4GB of ROM and a microSD card slot for storage expansion (compatible with up to 32GB). It s a dual-SIM smartphone , and both the SIM card slots are compatible with GSM networks. It supports maximum theoretical download and upload speeds of 7.2Mbps and 5.7Mbps respectively. There s Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth v3.0 with A2DP, and microUSB port. A-GPS takes care of location identifying and navigational needs of a user. Nokia acted pretty miserly in providing sensors to the X. It comes with only accelerometer and proximity sensor. After fully charging its 1,500 mAh battery (Nokia BN-01), the device is claimed by the company to last up to 406 hours of standby time, 10 hours and 30 minutes of 3G talk-time, or 26 hours of continuous music playback..

The Nokia "TRUST" bundled with Android's Flexibility. I ordered the phone on 31st december and the product was delivered to me on january 1st. It was packed very well and for additional safety the box was wrapped in bubble wrap. I ordered Nokia X Dual Sim in green colour. It looks very charming and catches everyone's eyes. I bought the phone for my mother. I was afraid she might find it difficult to use but fortunately she loved it and learned how to operate it very easily. Thanks to the beautifully crafted user interface which gives the ease of a windows phone and the operating system itself that is Android gives the phone user the flexibility to maneuver the phone as per user needs. PROS : * The phone has a very good touchscreen that is very responsive. * It comes with a pre-installed screen guard ( so no need to buy a new one ) * The sound quality is very good. * The phone comes with 512 mb ram that is enough for basic needs and even supports almost all good games without any lag *The primary camera being just 3 mp never disappoints you as the picture quality is very clear. There is no secondary camera though. Still the phone can support skype and viber video calls through the rear camera. Though it doesn't really makes any sense. * The phone comes with 4gb memory but the user available memory is around 1. 3 gb, though you can insert a memory card of capacity upto 32 gb. * The phone is user friendly and offers dual standby with 2g and 3g in one slot each. * Wifi connectivity is very good. * SUPER BEAM works flawlessly, so huge files can be transferred in no time over the wifi. * GPS connectivity is very good. "Here" maps application is as good as google maps and also offers offline navigation. * It has a 3.5 mm audio jack and gives good audio output. * The size of the phone is very good. You can watch movies and play games on it without any problem. You can play all video formats on it just download MX PLAYER. Apps like whatsapp , facebook messenger , hike works without any glitch. CONS : Not many , but still to mention *Downside is the 1500mah battery but it does justice to you by giving a whole day backup without any hiccups. * The google playstore doesnt works on this phone, but there are a few third party app markets from where you can download all the apps that are available on google play. * 512 MB RAM can be a limiting factor for techies, however it fulfills the basic needs. Overall expression: It has a very good build quality topped with NOKIA's trust , ANDROID's flexibility and ease of use because of the Windows like metro interface. So , if you are considering any phone under 5k tag then go for it ! (read more). Reviewed on MySmartPrice. Report spam 1 0. Nokia mobile price list in India. Samsung Galaxy On7 Pro price (Rs.
