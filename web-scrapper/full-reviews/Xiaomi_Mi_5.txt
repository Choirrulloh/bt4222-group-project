CNET también está disponible en español.. This fantastic phone gives Samsung's S7 a run for its money. The Good The Xiaomi Mi 5 has a sleek, lightweight design with a beautiful finish that's as good as any high-end phone. Great camera and dual-SIM features will let you use this as a travel phone too. It's top-of-the-line hardware at a low price.. The Bad There's no microSD card slot like the Samsung Galaxy S7, or removable battery like the LG G5.. The Bottom Line Xiaomi's impressive Mi 5 has the features to stand up against the very best, but it's a shame it won't be officially available worldwide.. There are actually three Mi 5 models Xiaomi Mi 5 model comparison. Spending the better part of my two-week vacation testing a phone seems like a terrible idea, but like my colleague Jessica Dolcourt, who took the Samsung Galaxy S7 for a spin in London and Berlin, I took the Xiaomi Mi 5 with me into the frigid, beautiful north -- first to Iceland, then to London, where I also got a chance to compare it directly to the Galaxy S7.. The result? The Mi 5 is terrific, especially when you consider that Xiaomi's new flagship phone costs significantly less than the Samsung Galaxy S7 and LG G5 , without compromising on its most important features. It's fast and has a good camera. And thanks to its two SIM card slots, I was able to roam on data with a local carrier, while still being able to use my phone number from back home in Singapore.. Xiaomi Mi 5 dazzles with low price and ceramic stylings (pictures). When I pulled out the pretty, lightweight Mi 5 in public, curious strangers who had never seen a Xiaomi phone before asked what it was -- many mistook it for a Samsung Galaxy.. The Mi 5 does lack unique extras such as the Galaxy S7's waterproofing and the LG G5's modular capabilities, but then it is half the price. It's just a shame that Xiaomi will only sell it to people in China and India. Other regions could use a handset like this.. Xiaomi's Mi 5 doesn't just come in one flavor -- while all three do look alike, the difference lies mainly in the hardware specs. The most powerful version, dubbed the Mi 5 Pro, has the highest-end parts and a ceramic rear instead of contoured glass. Check out the table below for the key differences.. 1.85GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor. 2.15GHz + 1.6GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor. 2.15GHz + 1.6GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor. 1,999 yuan ($305, £220 or AU$425). 2,299 yuan (355, £245 or AU$470). 2,699 yuan ($415, £295 or AU$575). The Mi 5 is a beautiful device with a curved backing, a glass or ceramic finish and a premium feel. The rounded rear makes it comfortable to hold and I didn't lose my grip once even while wearing thick gloves. The phone is slightly smaller than the S7, but with a slightly larger 5.15-inch full-HD display. It fits snugly in your pocket. The screen is pretty bright, and a built-in feature adjusted the display to make it readable even in the bright outdoors. It works, and it works marvellously.. The Mi 5 has a brilliant 1,920x1,080-pixel display.. Photos are never more important than when you're capturing memories of the trip of a lifetime. The Mi 5's 16-megapixel camera didn't let me down. I was impressed with the phone's lowlight performance, though it's not as good as the Samsung Galaxy S7 (I tested both myself in London and Barcelona). The rear camera takes beautifully bright pictures in good lighting, though colors can be a tad too saturated at times.. While the Galaxy S7 camera edges the Mi 5's, this camera can hold its own -- you won't be disappointed. Check out the gallery below for an in-depth look at the camera features and test shots.. Xiaomi Mi 5's camera shines in international test (pictures). To keep costs low on its flagship phones, Xiaomi usually uses a slightly older processor, reserving the newest chip for its top-of-the-line Pro model. That wasn't the case here; all three phones get the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, though the 32GB model isn't quite as fast, with a lower clock speed.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News. Homeland Security's tall order: A hacker-free election. 'Annihilation' director wove memory into a dream-like movie. Dogecoin: The joke cryptocurrency that was too real for its own good.

You’ll need to shell out at least £500 to buy each device outright or pay £40 a month as part of contract. But what if you could get a handset with a similar spec for hundreds of pounds less?. The Xiaomi Mi 5 is just that phone. It has the same CPU as the HTC 10, a camera with the same megapixel count as the LG G5 and a design similar to the beautiful Galaxy S7. Yet it can be had for just £275.. It sounds like the perfect deal. And in many ways it is. The Xiaomi Mi 5 is a fantastic phone, with one major downside. It’s not on sale in the UK, or Europe or even the USA. And it probably never will be. If you want this phone then you’ll have to import it.. If you’ve caught sight of any images of the latest slew of high-end phones from Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei and Oppo, it won’t come as any surprise that the Xiaomi Mi 5 is a beautifully crafted piece of kit.. Like the Samsung Galaxy S7, the Mi 5 is a mix of aluminium and Gorilla Glass 4. There isn’t a hint of plastic anywhere – antenna lines aside – and it’s an exceptionally well put together device.. The sides of the rear curve slightly – like the Galaxy S7 – and this makes all the difference to how comfortable the phone feels in your palm.. The front is equally sleek, with a reflective “Mi” logo on the top, alongside the front-facing camera, and an elongated home button sitting below the 5.1-inch display. That single button has an embedded fingerprint sensor inside it, which is fast – really fast.. In my tests, the phone was quicker than both the HTC 10 and Samsung Galaxy S7 and on a par with the Huawei P9. It’s accurate, too, failing to recognise my digit only once in around 20 attempts. Although it’s an actual physical button that can be pressed down, it’s capacitive, meaning you can simply touch it to get back to the homescreen.. Xiaomi is playing up the almost bezel-less nature of this phone. And yes, while there is very little space between the edges of the phone and the screen, there’s quite a large black bar running around the display that spoils the illusion somewhat. In reality, the Mi 5 has about the same amount of bezel as the HTC 10.. However, when you consider that the big selling point of this device is its low cost when compared to other flagship phones – it retails for between £275 and £390 on Gearbest.com – the fit and finish on offer here is impressive..

In fact, it feels far superior than the odd “metal that feels like plastic” build of the LG G5.. If I’m being really picky, I’d say that the Xiaomi Mi 5 is too light. On unboxing the handset, I thought it was missing a replaceable battery as it was so light; this wasn’t the case. I prefer phones that have reassuring heft; the Mi 5 feels like it might turn to dust if it were to accidentally drop to the floor.. When you consider that the Xiaomi Mi 5 is mostly fitted out with high-end components, it may be surprising to learn that the 5.15-inch display is merely a 1080p panel rather than the retina-slicing quad-HD variety you’ll find on the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and HTC 10.. Does this make a huge difference on a screen of this size? Not really. The LCD IPS display is impressive, and if I’d been told that it had a 2,560 x 1,440 resolution as opposed to 1,920 x 1,080 then I’d probably have believed it.. Pixels are indistinguishable from each other, and since it’s an IPS panel viewing angles are actually far better than the AMOLED of the Samsung Galaxy S7. There’s also no pinkish tinge when you tilt the device to the side, something I found quite common on the HTC 10.. The display is superb to look at, offering punchy colours that are saturated and bright – but not overly so. Reds are accurately represented, rather than being almost luminous, and blacks are inky and deep. Whites look great, too, with no sign of any muddiness creeping in.. It might lack some of the vibrancy you’d get with an AMOLED panel, but you’ll truly only notice this if you have multiple phones lined up next to one another.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

Thin body, measuring less than 7.5mm/0.3inches (0.29 inches). Lots of RAM (4 GB RAM). Lacks microSD slot for storage expansion. The compact, premium Xiaomi Mi 5 is the best value-for-money exchange you can do for a phone equipped with the blazing Snapdragon 820 chipset. It's tapered back is easy on the eye and the palm, and Xiaomi has placed all the bells and whistles of a modern-day flagship inside, such as optical stabilization, a 4 GB RAM version, or a large battery, eschewing only a 2K resolution for a 1080p one, though at 5.15" the perceived difference would be negligible anyway.. Xiaomi Mi 5 vs Apple iPhone 6s Xiaomi Mi 5 vs Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Mi 5 Review Xiaomi Mi 5 benchmarks. OS: Android (6.0), Xiaomi MI UI. Dimensions: 5.69 x 2.72 x 0.29 inches (144.55 x 69.2 x 7.25 mm). Weight: 4.90 oz (139 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 5.2 inches. Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels.

The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Sapphire crystal lens cover, Optical image stabilization, Autofocus (Phase detection).

Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running..

Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 24 Feb 2016. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Xiaomi Mi 5 review: the real MiCoy. ​ Xiaomi Mi 5 vs Galaxy S7 comparison. Xiaomi has finally released its long-awaited flagship, the Xiaomi Mi 5. After taking almost two years to appear, the successor to the Mi 4 is now with us. The Mi 5’s design is reminiscent of the Galaxy S7. Its hardware surpasses the LG G5. Regarding price, the Mi 5 outperforms all competitors. Could this be the best phone of 2016? Find out in our Xiaomi Mi 5 review.. Xiaomi Mi 5 release date and price. The Xiaomi Mi 5 can be imported quite cheaply. The Pro, the premium version, comes with 128 GB of flash memory, 4 GB of RAM and a ceramic back, will cost around US$499. The base model, with 32 GB of flash and 3 GB of RAM, is around US$410. The LG G5, comparable on specs, retails for around US$629.. Models which are available for importing come with a Chinese firmware. This can be switched to English (but not all languages). If you buy it from a local trader, check to see if your Mi 5 comes with pre-installed Google apps, as you won’t be able to access your Google account and the Play Store otherwise. We’ll turn to other difficulties in the software section below.. Another disadvantage of importing a Xiaomi Mi 5 relates to LTE support. The Mi 5 can not run on all available bands. In rural areas or on highways, it might drop to slower connections or go offline completely.. Xiaomi Mi 5 design and build quality. Left of the aluminum frame is the Dual-SIM slot. The Mi 5's back comes in either glass or ceramic options. The Xiaomi Mi 5 is glass-smooth and similarly curved like the Galaxy S7. Special protection against shocks, water or dust aren’t built in. The outer edge at the front is sharp and feels a bit ‘cutty’ in the hand. The almost frameless display looks beautiful.. The physical home button can also be used as a capacitive button. So you need him not to press to return to the Home screen.. For the material used in the back cover, you’ll either get curved glass or hard, glossy ceramic. The latter will be sold with the 128 GB Pro version and is harder than steel. With the glass variant, you can choose from either white, gold and black.. One of Xiaomi’s design feats was to keep the rear camera flush with the back, unlike the many protruding camera lenses we see in the iPhone and Galaxy S6. Somehow, Xiaomi fit it inside the 7.15 mm-thick casing. Another design feature is the excellent screen-to-body ratio on the phone’s front. Non-display surfaces are minimal and limited to the upper and lower edges.. The display offers great color and sharp detail. The Xiaomi Mi 5 display has absolutely convinced me. Its resolution is sufficient for everyday tasks and its brightness is more than sufficient. The colors are rich and deep and make pictures and videos look realistic.. The display is a 5.15-inch full HD LCD unit. Thanks to a LED backlight redesign over its predecessor, the maximum brightness can be increased to 600 cd/m². It also comes with pixel-level adaptive contrast, meaning you have serious control over display brightness.. This technology runs on Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon processor and its hexagon subunit. It regulates brightness so that white areas are less bright than dark ones.. After Easter 2016, new software for the imported Xiaomi Mi 5 will be available. After its release we’ll test it again. Until then, our judgment applies in this section on the impressions with the Chinese ROM, which is retrofitted with Google Apps and therefore malfunctions.. When you buy your Mi 5 from a trader, you could be offered either a variant with the Chinese ROM and Play Store pre-installed, or you might get the so-called multi-ROM variant which provides native support for Google Apps. Be aware of which model you’re buying and know the differences. Read on for the important ones.. Flaws with the Chinese software are particularly visible in apps that run in the background and maintain a constant server connection. This mainly includes messengers like WhatsApp or Threema.. With the multi-ROM version, you can install new firmware to the Mi 5. Even the Xiaomi Redmi 3 comes with an easy-to-use flashing instruction manual and the necessary files to replace the Chinese firmware with an international one.. The Xiaomi Mi 5 runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow underneath MIUI 7. This software has 175 million active users with only a team of 750 developers. With weekly software updates, MIUI is among the most dynamic user interface running on any smartphone today.. The Xiaomi Mi 5 is fast and has great gaming performance. Its performance is, in principle, below that of the Samsung Galaxy S7. In addition, the Mi 5 suffers from annoying software bugs. Since these should be fixed with a future firmware update, this might only be a short-term issue.. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 powers the Xiaomi Mi 5. This is considered the fastest smartphone processor of 2016 and is also used in other flagship devices, such as the LG G5 or the US version of the Samsung Galaxy S7. The Mi 5 uses many of the new features of this chip. Thus, the signal processor is actively used in the camera, where it ensures enhanced picture quality.. Also, the internal memory has been improved. Xiaomi has turned to Samsung to rely on what was featured in the Galaxy S6, UFS 2.0. This flash memory technology operates at up to 450 MB/s, so any app should be loaded in a split second.. In theory, this key data should offer a high work rate. But with my repeated testing there was an (apparent) thermally-induced reduction of processor power. This manifested itself in ever smaller measurements. Amazingly, this applies only to CPU tests. Gaming performance was not affected by the restriction.. To test image and video gallery. The camera of the Xiaomi Mi 5 is not as great as anticipated. The test images that Hugo Barra had leaked in advance were shot at tropical daylight and quite detailed. In anything less than perfect conditions, expect average photos. The image stabilizer ensures remarkably smooth video and steady-handed photos - yes, including selfies.. The camera doesn’t have a previously rumored aperture of f/1.6, but rather an ordinary f/2.0. The optical image stabilizer works using four axles; two rotational and two transversal.. These compensate for displacements to the smartphone housing. What that means is when your hands move, or the subject of your photo, you shouldn’t end up with blurry photos. In practice, the stabilizer proves to be an extraordinary selling point, ensuring exceptionally good video, making the Mi 5 one of the best multimedia smartphones that you can currently buy.. The sensor Xiaomi used is the new Sony IMX 298. Its new DTI Pixel to Pixel insulation allows a sharp demarcation between areas of different color. The new signal processor from Qualcomm works in the background for fast post-processing in real time. This is also demonstrated by the 4 MP selfie cam and advertised Mi video app.. The battery is charged quickly via Quick Charge 3.0. The Xiaomi Mi 5 battery lasts one day. It can be remarkably fast to charge. In about an hour it’s charged enough for a whole day’s use. For charging, it uses the Type-C connector. Your importer might also send an adapter.. Despite its compact housing, Xiaomi could spoil us with a good-sized battery. Here we only get a maximum capacity of 3,000 mAh. This was achieved by increasing the energy density to a remarkable 685 Wh/l.. 144.55 x 69.2 x 7.25 mm. 1920 x 1080 pixels (427 ppi). 128 GB 32 GB 64 GB. HSPA, LTE, NFC, Dual-SIM , Bluetooth. The Xiaomi Mi 5 is strong, but not as strong as I had hoped. The optical image stabilizer enhances the camera to film camera standard, giving it a bonus selling point. Since the device has to be imported and Google Apps must be installed, the G5 or the S7 might be the better choice for many customers. This may change when the Mi 5 ships with international software and seamless Google integration, which should be the case very soon.. If Xiaomi officially sells this phone in the US and the lack of LTE frequencies was resolved, the Mi 5 would be near unbeatable. But most of all - the Xiaomi Mi 5 shows that packaging high-end hardware at a mid-range price is possible.. curved glass on back was used for xiaomi note before samsung.... The Bluboo Maya with 2GB RAM, 16GB ROM, 13MP camera and Android 6.0 OS, only at $69.99,I have order 1 just waiting for it's arrival :). The Bluboo Maya with 2GB RAM, 16GB ROM, 13MP camera and Android 6.0 OS, only at $69.99,I have order 1 just waiting for it's arrival" :). I replaced my 'piece of junk Galaxy S6 Edge' with the Mi5. Very impressed compared to my twice as expensive (old) Samsung! (I am European. The Netherlands) Oh and the curve is on the back where it should be not on the front where it distorts the image). The phone is awesome, some people have commented that it has low storage, xiomi itself says that 25GB will be for an use and its 25 GB, if you feel its low then don't buy. The phone doesn't hang at all. The Camera clicks beautiful pictures with front and rear. The only issue is with heating, not always but while charging and while accessing some apps, and the battery temperature rises to 42 or 43 degrees and it really feels too much when you place it on the cheek while talking. What part of this review is "refreshed". I read the exact same content.. Xiaomi A company I was impressed with it at CES this year in Las Vegas Most of the criticism published in this article (poor 4GLTE signal, no pre-loaded Google apps) where exactly what I told the Sales Team at their Kiosk, except I was brutally honest (I told them look around at your competition, if you want to enter the North American Market? please come back to CES next year with an Android Smartphone that will function in North America with the latest Android OS) .... I also wasn't impressed with the prices ($300-$350 is the maximum I will pay for No Contract), I think they can come down for 2017. Where does that $400 figure come from? I paid just over $300 for the base model.. As the Global rom 7.2 miui has been released, will you guys be doing an updated review?. When you compared the cameras between Mi 5 and Galaxy S7, you'll see how miserable Xiaomi Mi 5 is. I live in a pretty rich family, so I could probably get this, but I'll need more information on the software.. You should just buy Samsung S7 then, just watch the comparison video on YouTube between mi5 and S7. I'm pretty poor, eventhough I wanted s7, I can only buy mi5 if the price come down below $350. Took me 6 months just to save money to that amount... Sellable! Seems to be a hit already!. It is a very nice phone with an excellent spec to price point but with a lack of the crucial band 20 which I suspect has been left out exactly to slow people from European countries importing it. Maybe an updated model will appear when the company feels the time is right. So for now let's see what other manufacturers will do to counter it.. Why is Xiaomi treated still like a newcomer from China. It has already released many phones and worked for it's rather good reputation. Xiaomi phones don't fare well against competition only in appropriate price brackets.. What do you mean it's "similarily curved as the S7"??????? It's curved actually the opposite direction! Similarily to the Sony Ericsson Arc S, not the S7. I think it's the best 2016 flagship so far next to Sony X Performance. I find the design of the Mi 5 way better than that of the sparkling, shiny S7- maybe it's more appealing to girls. The Mi 5 has got great image stabilization and great hardware. The only improvement could be done in software and the one lte band. Apart from that it's an awesome phone and I'm really wondering how the software copes on a daily basis.. Ok maybe I meant the the S7 edge.. My Mi 4 has an overheat issue, but it passes over a year of usage, yet it still operates well. And I recently realized that the device's camera could detect solar eclipse. That's amazing! And now Mi 5 finally available, hopefully it will arrive in Malaysia soon and looking forward to have one :). That's great, but I heard that the Mi 5 doesn't have very good storage at the moment. They're still working on a custom cloud storage space for any type of drive or mechanic to back up or even Bluetooth their memory onto other devices quickly. Hands on Xiaomi Mi 5 India | Xiaomi Mi 5 Reviews | Xiaomi Mi 5 First Impression techinfobit.com/hands-on-xiaomi-mi-5-india-xiaomi-mi-5-reviews-xiaomi-mi-5-first-impression. i just registered to be able to post this comment ,i wanted to let it pass but i couldn't there are 3 possibilities here: either the writer of this hands on review is slow in the brains department or has no idea what in the world he is doing or he is biased. first the curved back is an original xiaomi feature which was first introduced in their mi Note line that samsung copied. second there are only so many ways u can put the camera, home button and fingerprint scanner and xiaomi kinda used the best option possible to minimize the bezels and give the device a better look. its like saying since some company used 4 wheels on a car any car that is being made is a uninspired copy of that first one... i'm not a xiaomi fanboy xiaomi or any other brand but i HATE it when people write inaccurate articles like this. this will be my last visit to this site since they use unprofessional writers in their crew..

This phone looks great, feels great and has the spec list to match - with a price that's hard to believe. Sadly, it looks like distribution will be limited, but we can hope.... Xiaomi Mi 5 price and release date The Xiaomi Mi5 price is only $450/£300/AU$515 Xiaomi Mi5 was released in April 2016 Design and display The Xiaomi Mi5 comes with a glass back design and feels like a premium phone Metal frame makes it comfortable to hold 5.15-inch Full HD display that's bright with good color range. What if I told you that you could get a phone that's as stylish and powerful as the Samsung Galaxy S7 , but for a fraction of the price? You'd probably think I was the guy who creates those web ads that say 'This stay-at-home mum earns £3 billion every week using Google' or something similar.. But here's the thing: the Xiaomi Mi5 is exactly that Android phone – a powerful, beautifully designed handset that's not the price of your average flagship.. Price and availability are something of a moveable feast, however, because while the Xiaomi Mi5 is available in the UK through some retailers, it's never going to be sold on a carrier.. This is one of those phones that you have to track down yourself, buy upfront and plug your own SIM card into, although for experienced users this is hardly a challenge. The question is, is the Mi5 is worth seeking out?. At least that's my opinion, although there are some caveats with this phone too, and we'll get to those as we take a closer look at this interesting little device.. You can buy the Xiaomi Mi5 right now in the US and UK for $450/£300 while in Australia it costs AU$515. It has been out in all three markets for sometime now, so it may soon drop in price as well.. There are two variants of the Mi5. I've been testing the basic version, which has what Xiaomi calls a '3D Glass' back, and comes in 32GB or 64GB storage options coupled with 3GB of RAM. There's also a Pro model that has a ceramic back, and comes with 128GB of storage and 4GB of RAM.. Don't panic though, because this glass is tough. How do I know? Because the Mi5 has slid off my desk twice since I received it. This is because the glass rear offers very little friction, and on both occasions I'd placed it either on top of another phone or on another low-friction surface. But those mishaps did at least demonstrate that this phone is far from fragile.. You may have preconceptions about the build quality of low-cost Chinese phones, but in this case I urge you to cast them aside. The Mi5 is completely solid in every way, and nothing about it would give the uninitiated any reason to believe it wasn't a high-end device.. The metal frame looks and feels like it could have been designed by Samsung, while the 5.15-inch screen extends so close to the edges of the phone you wonder how Xiamoi managed to build such a marvel.. Weight : 129g Dimensions : 144.6 x 69.2 x 7.3mm OS : Android 6 Screen size : 5.15-inch Resolution : 1080 x 1920 CPU : Snapdragon 820 RAM : 3/4GB Storage : 32GB/64GB/128GB Battery : 3000mAh Rear camera : 16MP Front camera : 4MP. The display is equally impressive when it's turned on. It has a pretty modest resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels, which, compared to phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7 and LG G5 is a little low – those phones have similar screen sizes, but 1440 x 2560 resolutions.. I'm not a fan of looking only at the numbers though, and I can assure you that the Mi5's display is bright, colourful and full of detail. It's an IPS-type screen, rather than an OLED, but that doesn't seem to have a huge impact, as it still offers the kind of ultra-vivid colours you'd see on the Galaxy S7.. Xiaomi has opted for a USB-C connector on the Mi5 – and if you don't know what that is, then just know that it renders your old charging cables entirely useless, and requires you to buy extra cables for anywhere you might want to juice up your phone away from where you keep your main charger.. I'm grumpy about USB-C in general, as at this stage it doesn't add much apart from the ability to plug the cable in either way round. In the long run USB-C will be a good thing, but you won't be saying that when your phone runs flat at work and you've left your charger at home.. One feature about which I'm far from grumpy is the fingerprint scanner on the front of the Mi5, which is concealed beneath the home button.. I initially concluded that this was some kind of magic – either that or it wasn't really scanning my fingerprint at all, and the whole thing was some sort of joke. Why do I say this? Because it's so fast that I simply didn't believe it could really be scanning anything.. My theory was quickly disproved, however, by using a different finger to try and log in to the phone – it didn't work. So the fingerprint scanner is just really, really efficient. I didn't expect that – although maybe I should have, because most fingerprint scanners these days are fast and work well.. The headphone jack is located at the top of the phone, and next to that is an IR blaster that you'll never use. If you really did want to use it, it could be employed to control your TV – but you have a remote for that already, and I've yet to be persuaded that this kind of extra functionality is of much value..

Xiaomi mulls a 4.3-inch phone with Snapdragon 820. It looks like Xiaomi is considering a mini variant of the Mi 5 with a smaller 4.3-inch display.

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. Lenovo's Yoga 730 is a cheaper 2-in-1 with Alexa support. The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. Sony will sell its wireless 'open-ear' buds in the US. Tesla's electric trucks may be more cost-effective than expected. Up close and personal with Xiaomi's gorgeous Mi 5. After a few minutes playing with Xiaomi's Mi 5, a thought runs through my head: "I really shouldn't be surprised." The company has found enormous success in its native China, to the point that new allotments of phones sell out in minutes. Since Xiaomi phones have virtually no presence in the United States (or the Western Hemisphere, for that matter), my previous experience with them was limited to fits of fondling in Hong Kong phone shops. Xiaomi just held its first European press conference here at Mobile World Congress and brought new Mi 5s to share, and now — finally — I get the appeal.​. Frankly, it feels like a smaller, lighter Galaxy Note 5. That, for lack of anything more eloquent, is awesome. Xiaomi doesn't seem concerned about capturing the premium heft that comes with all-metal bodies, and that's fine — the Mi 5's mainly plastic body feels sturdy and well-built. My biggest gripe is how damned polished and shiny the non-Pro's rear is; not only will it reflect all the light that hits it, but it's liable to suck your fingerprints off from across the room. Fortunately, there's much less to be concerned about up front. The 5.15-inch 1080p LCD screen seemed bright and punchy even when we took the thing out under broad daylight (to the chagrin of the phone's handlers). While the Mi 4 was a slab of a phone , its successor is sleek, svelte and something I'd be proud to own. Oh, what a difference a few years makes. Physically, there's little about this package to complain about.. That's very likely the case for what's inside, too, though that's always kind of tough to suss out in the field. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 powers the show, and I spent most of my time with the middle-of-the-road 3GB RAM/64GB storage/2.15GHz model. Jumping between apps like a madman, swapping themes and generally trying to stymie this thing was mostly futile. As such, I didn't notice much different when I finally got some face time with the high-end Pro version and its 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage and 2.15GHz clock speed — once a device hits a certain level of speed, those differences in performance become so much harder to spot.. Gallery: Meet Xiaomi's Mi 5 and Mi 5 Pro | 24 Photos. Xiaomi's also very proud of the 16-megapixel camera sitting flush with the Mi 5's back (the jab at Apple's camera nub during Barra's presentation was inevitable). If you thought Oppo's three-axis image stabilization was hot stuff, dig this: The Mi 5 has four-axis stabilization, which is a lifesaver for video in particular. We here at Engadget used to have a thing for shaky-cam footage (weird phase, I know) but after a bit of field-testing, it really seems to help lock down those wobbles. Photo quality, on the other hand, seemed above average rather than game-changing. Hopefully we — or our colleagues at Engadget Chinese — will get a better sense of the phone's photography chops once the Mi 5 starts trickling into the wild.. Xiaomi's MIUI 7 is actually pretty pleasant, as custom interfaces go — it's light, fast and doesn't do much to obscure the Android Marshmallow core running underneath it. That won't always be the case, though; users can fire up their choice of themes to make their Mi 5 uniquely theirs. Some adhere pretty closely to Marshmallow's flat, colorful philosophy, while others (here's looking at you, "High Life") bathe Android with a brown reminiscent of café con leche. I'll pass, but I'm still pretty shocked that MIUI feels as clean and fluid as it does. If only all the other companies painting broad, inelegant strokes on top of Android would take Xiaomi's hint.. Last night, I dreaded the idea of waking up at 6:45 in the morning to come see Xiaomi show this thing off. Given its price tag, speed and style, the Mi 5 seems ready to stare down opponents from nearly any device maker. Now the most pressing question I'm left with is, well, are we ever going to get it in the United States? Barra, ever the provocateur, said the Mi 5 would launch in China, India and "other markets" — his punctuation of that last bit with a sly grin caused knowing murmurs and giggles to ripple through the room.. android , china , gear , hands-on , mi , mi5 , miui , miui7 , mobile , mobileworldcongress , mobileworldcongress2016 , mwc , mwc2016 , smartphone , video , xiaomi.

Lenovo's Yoga 730 is a cheaper 2-in-1 with Alexa support. The company also announced the Flex 14 at Mobile World Congress.. The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet.

Difficult to find: the Mi 5 is not officially distributed in America or Europe yet, so you have to order it sight-unseen from eBay or a third-party website.. Author: Maurizio Pesce Maurizio Pesce. The latest smartphone from Chinese electronics giant Xiaomi is powerful, well built, and relatively cheap (under $400).. Personal Software Smile Pretty Power Play. Whatever smartphone you're currently carrying in your pocket, you'd still probably be astonished by the Mi 5 anyway. The latest smartphone from Chinese electronics giant Xiaomi is powerful, well built, and relatively cheap. (You can get one for under $400, but it's not available in North America, so you have to poke around a little.) More than a few handsets can claim those advantages, but the Mi 5 is noteworthy because of the excellent capabilities of its hardware. The fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate, even if you have wet hands. The camera is among the best you'll find in a mid-budget smartphone. And the gorgeous, bezel-free display is a beauty.. That giant display, a 5.15-inch HD LCD panel with a sharp 1920x1080-pixel resolution, is bright enough for outdoor daytime use. At the bottom of the display, there's enough room for the first physical home button Xiaomi has ever put on a smartphone—the company has traditionally relied on capacitive buttons. The home button also doubles as fingerprint scanner, one I've found as fast as Apple's Touch ID sensor. Xiaomi's is more accurate than Apple's in some instances: the Mi 5 works perfectly with wet fingers, succeeding right where the iPhone fails.. A single press brings you back to the home screen, but you can set up the button to work as a capacitive sensor instead of a physical button if you prefer. It also has the ability to launch Google Now, show recent apps, or close the current app with a long press. The navigation soft keys at the bottom of the screen are also customizable, letting you assign multitasking and back functions as you wish.. The curved glass on the back looks and feels great, while the metal frame that goes all around bends on each side and adds a kind of premium feel. This effect is boosted by the ceramic finish of the more expensive "Pro" version (selling online for around $550). However, the Mi 5 doesn't stand out from the crowd as visually unique. I've found it nice enough to carry around, but it's just a big Android phone with no flair or swagger.. Turn it on and you'll find the latest version of Xiaomi's Android-based MIUI operating system: it comes with no apps drawer, a flat colorful look, lots of customizations, and literally thousands of wallpapers and themes. Some even have games you can play on the lockscreen. Built on top of Android Marshmallow, MIUI 7 includes some new features such as an integrated call recorder, a password protected child mode, a do not disturb mode, and guest modes. An additional one-handed mode works similar to Apple's reachability: it reduces the software interface down to only 3.5 inches. You active one-handed mode by just swiping a finger from the home button to the side where you want the display to collapse to. A useful perk is the Smart Lock feature that relies on trusted places, paired devices, voice recognition, and on-body detection to authenticate a user. So if you're wearing your Xiaomi smart watch or if you're on your home Wi-Fi network, for example, you can skip the lock screen when you wake up the phone from standby.. One of my favorite features on this phone is the camera, a Sony 16-megapixel unit covered with sapphire protective glass. It takes excellent and clear images with its f/2.0 aperture and unique 4-axis optical image stabilization system. Overall, the camera is great for its price range: in daylight shots, it performs as well as a high-end smartphone, producing fine details and accurate colors. Even indoor, the camera still stands up to the more expensive options, and it's only in low-light conditions that the sensor isn't very impressive. In dimmer scenes, it tends to overexpose and lose details. It's only in low light that the differences between the camera on the Mi 5 and the ones on higher-end phones start to show.. The camera's software comes with 11 filters, including one that adds a privacy patch on a customizable area of the picture. There are also nine modes, including Panorama, Tilt-Shift, Fisheye, and an "Auto-Straighten" mode that enables perfectly framed shots in almost every condition. There's a "Handheld Twilight" mode that's a sort of HDR treatment for nighttime pictures. It takes a series of shots with different exposures and then automatically combines them to create an optimized single photo. There's a Timer mode, too, but even better is the Audio mode—fire the shutter just by saying "click", "capture" or "snap." And of course there's a Beautify mode, with a creepy built-in tool that guesses age and gender of the recognised face—it guessed my age within one year; luckily one year younger than I actually am. The feature automatically applies a filter to your selfies, picking the most appropriate filter of its 36 choices based on your age and gender.. Hands-on camera nerds will appreciate the Mi 5's manual mode, which allows you to adjust parameters most people can't be bothered with: white balance, focus point, ISO, and exposure time. More usefully, exposure can be adjusted on auto mode too, from -2 to +2 in regular 0.3 stops. The digital zoom goes up to 8x, but I wouldn't recommend ever using it: just like with any other smartphone, it is way better to crop the image after the shot.. The image stabilization technology works great for stills and for videos, which remain well stabilized even when you're shooting them with one hand. However, the video camera acts oddly in low light conditions. It kept refocusing constantly, disrupting the vibe of my beautiful family holiday videos.. Everything on the Mi 5 runs very fast, thanks to Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 820 chipset and a choice of 3 of 4 GB of RAM. The built-in browser is even faster than Google Chrome, and comes with a handy text resizer that applies any zoom level to web pages. The phone often felt warm, but it never get close to overheating in my testing, even while handling games or pushing through heavy multitasking sessions. I consistently got an entire day of use out of the 3000 mAh battery between charges.. There's no microsSD slot for storage expansion, but I don't see that as a downside: the Mi 5 offers either 32 or 64GB of internal memory on the regular version, and 128GB on the "Pro" model. Each phone also comes with 5GB of free Mi Could Storage in addition to every possible service of sort, from Google Drive to DropBox.. It's an excellent phone that, while lacking visual flair, makes up for it with great hardware and an innovative customized Android experience. One last note about that software. The Mi 5 comes in two different versions: one for the Chinese market with Xiaomi's Mi Store on board, and one for international markets with the Google Play Store and Google's services. If you're going to buy it somewhere online and you don't live in China, be sure to get the international version..

Xiaomi's software needs a serious upgrade, though. Page: 1 2 Next →. - Mar 22, 2016 12:00 pm UTC. SPECS AT A GLANCE: Xiaomi Mi 5. Android 6.0 Marshmallow with MIUI 7. Dual band 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, NFC. USB Type C, 3.5mm headphone jack. 16MP rear camera with phase detection autofocus and OIS, 4MP front camera. 144.6 x 69.2 x 7.3 mm (5.69 x 2.72 x 0.29 in). quick charging, IR blaster, notification LED. The software: Android 6.0 internals with an Android 4.4 interface. Xiaomi needs to do something about its software. Google Now on Tap support. Not much happening on the back. The top of the device has the usual speaker, sensor cluster, and front facing camera.. The bottom has a Samsung-style home button/fingerprint reader. While you can't see them, there are two capacitive buttons to the left and right.. The camera and the flash are alone on the back.. The left and right sides of the back curve in for a more pleasant grip.. That's USB Type-C on the bottom.... ...and an IR blaster on the top.. Here you can really see the curve from the sides.. While Samsung and its Galaxy S7 mostly competes with high-end devices like the iPhone, Xiaomi makes its money attacking the mid- and low-end of the market. The company is all about bang-for-your-buck, often delivering very good specs at low prices. How low? Like most flagships, the Xiaomi Mi 5 sports the new Snapdragon 820 processor and a USB Type-C port, all for the distinctly not-flagship price of RMB 1999 (~$305). You could buy two of these for the price of a Galaxy S7 or LG G5. catch is that the Mi 5 is currently only available in China.. Mi 5 might be the phone that Xiaomi uses to finally break into the Western market. Despite its name, Mobile World Congress generally focuses on phones for Europe and the US, and Xiaomi's first-ever appearance may be a sign of things to come. Xiaomi is also sending review units to a few US press outlets—we didn't import this one. The company opened online stores for products like its earbuds and headsets in the US, UK, France, and Germany, but the stores don't sell smartphones yet.. Standard: (two 1.8GHz Kryo cores and two 1.6 GHz Kyro cores). Pro: (two 2.15GHz Kryo cores and two 1.6 GHz Kyro cores). The Mi 5 is very much a "budget flagship" phone: it feels and performs like a high-end device, but Xiaomi saves money by trimming features where most customers won't notice. The Mi 5's Snapdragon 820 only runs at 1.8GHz instead of the 2.15GHz you'd get on a Galaxy S7. The Mi 5 skips the crazy smartphone display resolution wars by going with a sensible 5.1-inch 1080p screen. The 428 PPI will lose a spec sheet battle with a 577PPI Galaxy S7, but when you consider an iPhone 6S only has a 326 PPI screen, 428 PPI is just fine. You get "only" 3GB of RAM, a full 1GB less than you'd get on the S7, but that's still plenty. There's no out-of-control spec creep, and you even get some important extras, like a fingerprint reader, NFC, an IR blaster, dual SIM cards, and the USB Type-C port I mentioned earlier.. But if you really want to fight the spec sheet battle, there's also a "Pro" version coming soon, which should be more comparable to something like a Galaxy S7. For just RMB 2699 (~$415), the Mi 5 Pro will have a 2.15GHz Snapdragon 820, an extra GB of RAM, a whopping 128GB of storage, and a "ceramic" back. The Galaxy S7 doesn't come in a 128GB version, and last year the MSRP on a 128GB Galaxy S6 was $1000.. The Mi 5's design is reminiscent of a Galaxy S6 or S7. The phone is a glass sandwich with a metal band around the sides, and Xiaomi added a Samsung-style clicky home button/fingerprint reader to the front with capacitive touch buttons on either side. The glass back of the device curves along the long side, just like the Galaxy S7 and the Xiaomi Mi Note. The curved rear edge that has started to show up in these phones is a step forward in comfort.. As usual with Xiaomi flagships, the build quality is every bit as good as what you'd get on a $700 device. The only complaint we've heard is from people who (for some reason) equate weight with quality; they think the Mi 5 is too light. The button action is great—the power and volume buttons are particularly solid and clicky, and they stick out of the phone quite a bit thanks to the curved edge on the back.. The paint job on the white Mi 5 is designed to conceal the side bezels as much as possible. The top and bottom of the phone is white, while a black frame surrounds and blends into the LCD, creating the impression that the screen stretches from edge to edge. It looks cool and reminds us of those silly " concept renders " of phones with impossibly small bezels.. The front has an oval-shaped hardware home button with an integrated fingerprint reader. The fingerprint reader is fast and accurate—just hold your finger on it for a reading, same as an iPhone or a Nexus.. To the left and right of the home button are two capacitive buttons that act as "back" and "recent apps". These capacitive buttons are the weakest element of the hardware design—they're totally unlabeled. The buttons are invisible if the button backlight is off, and even when the lights are on, the touch points are only marked with two little dots—you can see where the button is, but not what it does. The buttons aren't labeled because you can swap the "back" and "recent" functionality in the software, a compromise between Samsung's "Recent, home, back" order and Google's "back, home, recent" order. Any user interface designer will tell you unlabeled buttons are bad for usability. We wish Xiaomi had just picked an order and labeled them.. While this is a phenomenal piece of hardware for the money, the big downside is that Chinese phones meant for China lack a ton of LTE bands that international phones need. If you bring the Mi 5 to the US, you'll have a shot of getting 3G and making phone calls, but LTE is out of the question for most carriers. You might have a chance with Sprint, but then you won't have the CDMA bands for phone calls.. Home screen, notification panel, and recent apps screen.. Hiding notifications, the quick settings screen, and the regular settings screen.. The lock screen changes backgrounds, but there's no notifications.. If you tap on the button in the upper right you can favorite the pictures or change the settings.. There's a section called "Purchased," but you can't actually purchase anything.. Unlike the Xiaomi Redmi 3 we imported earlier this year, our Mi 5 is a loaner from Xiaomi with the company's international ROM loaded on it. This is pretty much the "everywhere but China" software package for countries like India and Singapore. As a result, our Mi 5 arrived with the full loadout of Google apps, including the Play Store, instead of Xiaomi's app store, which is only for China.. Some weird stuff still sneaked in, like a "Security" app with a storage cleaner, phone block list, and virus scanner. The virus scanner might be a necessity in the free-for-all app market of China, but Google does a decent (if not perfect) job of keeping malicious apps out of the US Play Store. Our loaner came with a theme store, but unlike the theme store in China, Xiaomi doesn't offer paid themes.. When we first looked at a Xiaomi device with the Mi 4 , the company's Android skin, known as MIUI, was different and maybe a little weird, but it wasn't awful. That was an Android 4.4 phone with an Android 4.4 interface to match. Since then MIUI has had a "flat" redesign, and the functionality of the interface has pretty much stood still for two years. Xiaomi seems to want a unified interface across its lineup, but that means the new, high-end phones running the latest version of Android have to be dragged down to match old, low-end phones.. MIUI is actually how Xiaomi got its start. Originally, Xiaomi was a software house that made its MIUI ROM as aftermarket software for popular phones. MIUI works a lot like CyanogenMod: you unlock your bootloader, pick your phone from the website, and flash the appropriate software package. Eventually the company moved on to making hardware with MIUI packed in, but it still offers software for many non-Xiaomi phones.. As you can imagine from the drop-in interface, MIUI makes the most drastic changes of OEM skins. Usually these changes make things look more like iOS and less Android. The icons all have square backgrounds with little red notification badges in the upper corner of the icon, just like iOS. The recent apps interface changed from vertically scrolling to an iOS-style horizontally scrolling interface, and the settings look just like iOS.. Xiaomi's skin development works a little differently than most OEMs. You would hope that every time a new Android version comes out, an OEM rebuilds its skin so it can incorporate the newest features from Google. For MIUI, however, the interface is independent of the Android version. MIUI is an interface that gets dropped on top of Android, wiping out whatever is there and replacing it with whatever Xiaomi came up with.. The Mi 5 ships with "MIUI 7" running on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow, but "MIUI 7" works on devices going back to Android 4.4 KitKat. It's a unified interface, so there's a "lowest common denominator" effect going on. MIUI 7 only really supports Android 4.4 features, because it has to run on Android 4.4 devices. This means you'll usually get all the under-the-hood features from Android 6.0, but MIUI 7 removes interface improvements from Android 6.0 and Android 5.0 Lollipop.. So if you compare MIUI 7 versus stock Android 6.0, you'll lose:. It's crazy to see a company throw away mostly "free" features like this. MIUI is old, dated, and easily the worst part of the Mi 5.. The most important parts of an OEM skin are the notification panel, lock screen, and recent apps screen, because those are the three biggest UI elements that can't easily be replaced by users. These are areas that Google has really worked on in recent versions of Android, but because you're using a KitKat-derived interface, you lose important functionality in all of them.. We originally said the Mi 5 didn't support lock screen notifications—it will display some notifications, but it works differently than stock Android. On stock Android, the lockscreen notifications are just an exact copy of the notification panel. On the Mi 5, if the phone is off and notifications come in, they will display once on the lock screen, but in subsequent viewings, the lock screen will be blank. It works as a "while you were away" screen, but it's not uncommon for the lock screen to be blank while there are. of older notifications in the regular notification panel.. Enlarge / The permissions settings in MIUI. All of those Cerberus permissions were granted without consent.. A lack of support for Android 6.0's permission system is probably the Mi 5's strangest omission. MIUI has had a permissions system for longer than stock Android, but it's not compatible with Android 6.0's permissions system—the one Play Store and all the "Android 6.0-aware apps" ( Apps targeting API 23 and higher) are written for.. In Android 6.0, Google added an à la carte permissions system, and also changed the way Play Store works. With the older, monolithic permissions system, Play Store was responsible for informing the user. It would pop up a big list of take-it-or-leave-it permissions before installing, and users could hit "accept" or back out of the app install. In Android 6.0, responsibility for informing the user moved to the system for Android 6.0-aware apps. For those apps, Play Store doesn't show a big list of permissions anymore; it's the system's job to pop up with an individual "allow or deny" box for each permission when it is used.. Now for the fun part: Xiaomi's OS is based on Android 6.0, but works like older versions of Android—all of an app's permissions are granted at the time of install. If you're installing an Android 6.0-aware app, Play Store never pops up a list of permissions. Instead, Play Store expects the system OS to be there with granular "allow or deny" popup boxes. Xiaomi never implemented the granular permission pops, though, so both Play Store and MIUI expect the other to be responsible for displaying permissions. The end result is that neither one displays the permissions. An app is granted all of the permissions it asks for without the user ever seeing or approving the list of permissions.. Again this is only for apps that target the newest version of Android. For apps that don't target API 23, Play Store will pop up with the old-school list of bundled permissions. Only the most modern, up-to-date apps will slip through the cracks.. MIUI 7 has a permissions system, but it only works for contact and SMS access. For everything else—things like your location, camera, and microphone—permissions are automatically granted. There is still a MIUI permission settings screen, where you can enable or disable permissions after installation (which in some cases would be after the permissions are initially granted)..

Updated on 02-17-2016 by Julian Chokkattu:. specs of the Mi5 leaked from two different sources.. The full specs of the upcoming Xiaomi Mi5 have been leaked in two separate ways — and each of the leaks. offers slightly different information alluding to two variants of the device, according to GizChina. Keep in mind that these are still leaks, so we can’t verify the information, and please take everything with a grain of salt. Besides, with Mobile World Congress being less than a week away, it won’t be long until we get the full details on the Mi5.. The first leak comes in the form of a packaging label for the Mi5, which tells us the device will have a Snapdragon 820 processor 2.15GHz, an oddly-sized 5.15-inch display, a USB Type C port, and a 3,000mAh battery. this information and the second leak. in the camera specs, with this variant having a 16-megapixel rear camera, and a front-facing 4-megapixel (ultrapixel) camera. Images of the metal chassis of the phone were leaked as well.. The second leak is of images — not of the smartphone, but of Xiaomi’s presentation file for the Mi5. This leak says the device will have a Micro SD card, dual-SIM support, and NFC — a feature Xiaomi removed after the Mi3. This presentation also says the display will be 5.2-inches, with a 1,920 x 1080p resolution.. the differences in screen size allude to the possible curved model of the device, which we’ve heard rumors of before.. There will indeed be two offerings at the least, one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, and one with 4GB of RAM as well as 64GB of storage. mentions a 26-megapixel rear camera with an f/1.6 aperture, which means perhaps the 4GB RAM version will have a better camera than the 3GB RAM variant, which may be stuck with a 16-megapixel rear camera. The device is also purported to have Qualcomm 3.0 fast charging.. If the presentation leak is correct, you’ll be able to purchase the device on February 26, after Mobile World Congress.. To build up hype for the Mi5, Hugo Barra, vice president of International at Xiaomi, posted a video. to Facebook teasing the device’s speed.. If these specs align with what we saw in mid-November, the Mi5 will be a powerhouse. benchmark test for a device codename Gemini appeared on Geekbench’s site. While these can easily be faked, it does show the Gemini running an MSM8996 Qualcomm chip — better known to use as the Snapdragon 820 — with 3GB of RAM, and Android 6.0 Marshmallow installed. The Gemini’s appearance coincided with talk of a December announcement.. In late September, @leaksfly on the social network Weibo published another set of specs, and because they differ once more than those we’ve seen before, it suggests Xiaomi has been gradually tweaking the phone while it waits for the right moment to launch it.. The @leaksfly data said the phone will feature a 5.2-inch screen with a 1080p resolution, smaller and lower resolution than previous rumors — including those from previous @leaksfly leaks. The Snapdragon 820 processor with 4GB of RAM are still likely, according to the source, along with a 16-megapixel camera on the rear, and an 8-megapixel from cam. This information matches the latest leak, except for the 8-megapixel front-facing camera. the device will run on Android 5.1.1, which will inevitably be covered in the MIUI skin, plus a choice of a 16GB or 32GB model.. Before this, according to a leak in early July , the specs were yet again thought to be different.. said to be 5.3-inches — slightly larger than the Mi 4 — and with a 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution.. The rear camera was listed as. 16 megapixels, while the front facing camera may come in at 6 megapixels. rumor mentioned a Micro SD slot for expanded storage, a micro SIM slot, a 3030mAh battery, and Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. It looks as though the Micro SD card rumor may be right.. Talk of the Snapdragon 820 started back in May, after a. said Xiaomi will pair the processor with 4GB of RAM, and offer both a 16GB and a 64GB model. screen was expected to measure 5.5-inches and have a 2,560 x 1,440 pixel resolution, making it slightly smaller in size than the 5.7-inch Mi Note Pro. leaks suggest there will be two Mi 5 models, a standard model with 4GB of RAM, and a second phone with 3GB of RAM.. Other features listed back then included a cameras with. optical image stabilization — plus a USB Type-C charging port. Xiaomi may use aluminum for the phone’s body, and it may measure just 5.1mm thick. Finally, as part of the Snapdragon 820, the phone may use Qualcomm’s ultrasonic fingerprint authentication system. The fingerprint sensor was also part of the July rumor report from Mobipicker.. Although the Mi 5 is expected to launch with Xiaomi’s MIUI on top of Android, a new rumor hints that the Chinese company may offer a Windows 10 Mobile variant of the Mi 5, too. Windows Mobile Power User picked up the news from a few Chinese sources, including GizmoChina. The site claims that the Windows version will sport all the same specs as the Android model and arrive at the same time during Mobile World Congress on February 24.. The Xiaomi Mi 5 has been rumored for months, and will finally launch in February 24. The news comes directly from Xiaomi’s global product director Hugo Barra, who posted a teaser image for a press event on his Facebook page. Additionally, he wrote, “Mi 5 is almost here! It’s Xiaomi’s first product launch in 2016, happening on February 24.”. The date also happens to be right in the middle of Mobile World Congress, where Samsung, LG, and HTC are all likely to reveal major 2016 smartphone releases. It’s not clear is Xiaomi will also be at the show — it has never done so before — but what is obvious is that it wants to capture plenty of the limelight.. This comes after a wealth of leaks and rumors, many of the most recent pointing to a February announcement.. In a Weibo post , Xiaomi co-founder and senior vice president Liwan Jiang said the company was accelerating production of the Mi 5 , ready to stock shelves soon after the Spring Festival, the holiday period around Chinese New Year. This lines up with new information saying that the device will be available for purchase on February 26, 2 days after the announcement.. This also fits in with an earlier. leak (credit to My Drivers ), where a banner inside an unnamed Foxconn facility was pictured saying the Mi 5 is now in mass production.. We’ve been tracking Mi 5 launch rumors for a while. In 2015, the last we heard was the phone would be shown off on. Going back further, there were lots of rumors of a November launch date, but. Xiaomi would hold off the Mi 5 launch until the Snapdragon 820 became available for mass production.. Before the November leaks, we heard about an October 19 event, which turned out to be the launch of the Segway-type scooter. Specification leaks go back even further.. Two new images of what’s supposed to be the Xiaomi Mi 5 leaked in late January, showing a standard Mi 5 and a second, curved model, that may be something like Samsung’s Galaxy S6 Edge. Originating on the Weibo social network , the standard flat model differs from previously leaked images by having the proximity sensor above the speaker, rather than alongside. The chassis looks to be made from metal, and the glass may have a 2.5D curve. The Mi logo sits in the top left corner.. Possible Leaked Mi 5 with a curved edge. Possible leaked Mi 5 with a flat display. The second image shows a phone with what’s referred to as an Edge-style curve down both sides of the chassis. The picture is certainly of a different phone — the front cam and proximity sensor match previous leaks here — and there’s definitely the hint of a curved edge. However, it’s not as pronounced as Samsung’s Galaxy S6 Edge, and may not have the same functionality. There’s also a chance the curve is an optical illusion, or worse, a clever fake. The chassis doesn’t have the same antenna breaks as seen in the other image, and may have an IR sensor on the opposite side to the headphone jack.. If Xiaomi is going to announce two versions of the Mi 5, the rumor says the standard looking phone may have 4GB of RAM, while the Edge model may have 3GB. We’ve seen leaked renders of a phone that may be the Mi 5, complete with a physical home button, and 2.5D glass before, but that doesn’t make these new leaks anymore genuine, and may still be prototypes.. Recently leaked images by a user on Weibo show off what looks to be the Xiaomi Mi 5 in four colors: black, gold, white, and pink. The notable difference in this image compared to that of previously leaked renders is the home button, which is not as round and resembles the button on Samsung Galaxy devices. The image does seem to confirm the rumored 2.5D glass front panel, assuming it’s the real deal.. A video was also leaked of the Mi 5 sitting on a wooden dock, but it doesn’t look completely similar to the leaked images. It’s a little more rectangular and not as rounded as the images purport the device to be. Of course, it could be an earlier prototype. In early December, two leaks gave us a look at potential. The first came from GizmoChina and a Weibo source, and showed the front of the phone with a black border. The Mi logo and a home button — that’s expected to house a fingerprint sensor — were the only other points of interest.. A few days later, another image was published on the Weibo social network, this time in the shape of a full render. It shows a curved 2.5D glass front panel, and a similar home button design to the first leaked image, plus there is the hint of a USB Type-C charger mounted underneath. The Mi logo is missing from its usual home in the top left of the body.. images are official, and should be considered speculative until the phone is finally made official..

Introduction Xiaomi is a leading smartphone maker from China whose reputation for powerful, stylish and aggressively-priced gadgets stretches well beyond the Republic's borders. With its latest flagship smartphone, the Mi 5 , the brand wants to offer almost everything that $700 handsets like the Samsung Galaxy S7 or iPhone 6s do, at a considerably lower price. It's an ambitious undertaking that could spark anyone's interest. Let's see if the hype is worth it – or not! In the box: Xiaomi Mi 5 USB Type-C Cable USB Charger Warranty and instructions SIM tray ejector Design Nice looks and great ergonomics with just a few rough spots. Xiaomi's flagship has a graceful, understated appearance. It's got clean lines, slim bezels, a metal frame, and a glass-covered back (unless you get the Ceramic Exclusive variant). Unaware of the Mi 5's affordable pricing, some could actually mistake it for an expensive smartphone, but its good looks are deceptive. The metal frame lightly prickles the palm at some spots, the glass back doesn't feel as nice as those of more expensive handsets, and the power and volume keys are slightly wobbly. Still, these are minor flaws that don't offend, but merely make the Xiaomi Mi 5's price tag seem realistic, rather than too good to be true. We're fond of this sleek and elegant handset that's comfortable to hold and easily lends itself to one-handed operation. The Home button is a bit narrow for our tastes and its tactile feedback isn't very good, but the fingerprint scanner in it is top-notch – fast, accurate, and reliable. On the other hand, those capacitive navigation keys might appear dated in 2016, but they do what they are supposed to. Display A high-quality screen with great brightness and contrast properties. The Mi 5 has a 5.2-inch IPS LCD display with 1080p resolution that comes off as high-quality, both in our measurements and in real-life use. The brightness levels are superb and cater to comfortable usage across all lighting conditions, while the color balance is close to ideal. This is a balanced, well-calibrated screen whose quality could stand up to that of more expensive offerings, if it weren't for the average viewing angles.. 5.69 x 2.72 x 0.29 inches. 144.55 x 69.2 x 7.25 mm. 5.61 x 2.74 x 0.31 inches. 142.4 x 69.6 x 7.9 mm. 5.74 x 2.83 x 0.35 inches. 5.44 x 2.64 x 0.28 inches. 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The numbers below represent the amount of deviation in the respective property, observed when a display is viewed from a 45-degree angle as opposed to direct viewing.. Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright).

I don't see anything that make this phone to get 7.0 only!!!. at least it deserves 8.2 or higher!. (Posts: 180; Member since: 28 May 2015). posted on 05 May 2016, 05:22. PA's review system is a joke, so don't give it much thought. I had opened the review just to check what reasons they would come up with to give it such a low rating. But because they couldnt find any major flaws, they have just out done themselves by blatantly giving it a 7 without specifying any reason whatsoever. They just can't take in the fact that it provides a smartphone experience as good as their beloved iPhone at less than half the cost. I am sure it would have scored more had they priced their device higher like Huawei do.. (Posts: 474; Member since: 10 Mar 2010). posted on 05 May 2016, 05:28. you can easily take the "fruit" logo and put in the back of this phone. Iphonearena will certainly rank it 9.5. posted on 05 May 2016, 05:36. The only reason they are giving this a low score is because they fear it will hamper their beloved samsung galaxy S7 sells. Looks, display, battery life, interface are better than S7. Camera is only marginally worse than S7. (Posts: 226; Member since: 11 Mar 2014). posted on 05 May 2016, 05:45. in response to #10 Hide. B) You're high if you think this has a better display. C) Lolnope, the S7 has way better battery life. There's a happy medium, no need for extremes in either direction.. posted on 05 May 2016, 05:57. in response to #13 Hide. LOL, nope mi5 has better battery life. You are high if you think crap pentile display is better than RGB display.. (Posts: 226; Member since: 11 Mar 2014). posted on 05 May 2016, 06:16. in response to #17 Hide. Haha really, the Pentile argument? That's been invalid since like 2014. It's impossible to tell at such a high resolution, what a stupid thing to even say. The S7 display is way better, because OLED displays are just way better than LCD, no way of arguing that.. posted on 05 May 2016, 06:30. in response to #22 Hide. Samsung head of display and TV disagrees with you. He argues LCD ( in the form of QD LCD) is better than OLED display..

Say that to top executive of Samsung display and TV. I'll provide the link where he argues that LCD is still superior to OLED. He even says that he is not sure if OLED is the future. (Posts: 226; Member since: 11 Mar 2014). posted on 05 May 2016, 07:00. in response to #29 Hide. I didn't ask for a link, I asked you why you think OLED isn't superior (which it is). So what, because one Samsung employee says LCD is better that makes the rest of Samsung's (who CLEARLY think OLED is the future and way better than LCD) opinion invalid?. posted on 05 May 2016, 07:12. in response to #32 Hide. The link i provide also says why LCD is better than OLED. That One Samsung employee happens to be the chief of Samsung electronics. He get to decide which direction the whole company in this case Samsung electronics and TV will go. If he didn't see the potential in LCD and if he thought LCD is inferior then he wouldn't comment like this.. posted on 05 May 2016, 10:39. in response to #40 Hide. You are clueless, samsung since their s6 and note 5 surpass any ips display with their mature amoled tech. Be it color temp, viewing angles, black levels, and even brightness which is the best among flags. Don't comment for the sake of commenting. Your words are funny at best. Panel manufacturers would DIE to be in samsung position in maturity of oled tech development. Samsung deserve all the credit and hard work. posted on 05 May 2016, 12:53. in response to #71 Hide. The link I provide back up my arguments. If the chief of Samsung Electronics claims that LCD is better than OLED than I say I'm right and you are the real clueless fanboy here. Fact: 1)You are a blind Samsung fanboy. 2) Samsung Chief of Electronics and TV said LCD is better than OLED. 3) He also said OLED maybe not the future display tech but QD LCD is, considering the progress QD LCD are making. 4) You comment is a joke and a fine display of disgusting fanboyism.. (Posts: 653; Member since: 22 Mar 2015). posted on 05 May 2016, 06:09. in response to #13 Hide. 7 is still low, so its not a good score.

But obviously as a member here for quite some time, i know reviewers are biased on Chinese phones but give north American OEMS especially Samsung and Apple a high plausible score.
