Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Features Video calling, Video sharing Video calling. Front-facing camera 2 megapixels 2 megapixels.

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

Accessories Charger, USB cable, Quick start guide. FCC ID value: QISCRO-LX2 link. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $118 Buy.

Huawei Y3 2017 Rating by MobileDokan. The main reason for Huawei to get exceptionally high popularity within a very short time in Bangladesh is nothing but its price. Huawei was already a known and fine reputed brand in international market before officially launching their products and service in Bangladesh. So, when they bought quality phones in the market in relatively fair price comparing to other top brand, people started to prefer Huawei phones. But now with, Huawei Y3 2017 , the game changes slightly. It costs almost 9K (as of June 2017) and yet has a FWVGA screen. Whereas some other brands are giving HD screen phones in this price. There is no OTG and only 2 MP front camera. These are some serious disadvantages of Huawei Y3 2017. Moreover, it doesn't have enough attractive features to cover these weaknesses. 4G network support and 8 MP autofocus primary camera are definitely some good features in this price range. 5 inch IPS LCD display is fine too. But it's also nothing extra ordinary or exceptional. Battery backup is also very much of average quality. So, Huawei is definitely going down with this device. But we hope that they identify this issue and introduces better gadget in near future.. User Rating: 2.73 ( 104 votes). Huawei Y3 2017 Rating by MobileDokan.
