more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Lenovo K6 and K6 Note Review. Lenovo K6 and K6 Note Review. by Victor Hristov. Android - Android + Lenovo - Lenovo +. 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction At first look, the new Lenovo K6 and K6 Note are nothing out of the ordinary: two slightly chubby Android phones with a fingerprint on the back, running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and with no clear path for future updates. Yawn, right? But there is more to them than one can spot on the surface. We have been testing and using the phones for a while, and we are eager to tell you what makes them stand out. Hint: it’s not just the rock-bottom price. With no further ado, let’s kick off our review of the Lenovo K6 and K6 Note. Design and Display Old-school design that looks solid, but lacks refinement. Display quality is not terrible, but whites are bluish and colors are not well balanced. The Lenovo K6 and K6 Note both share an identical design: a slightly chubby and slightly overweight body, a metal back cover with catchy silver trim accents around the camera and the fingerprint sensor on the back. This would have been fine late last year when the phones launched, but we’re in 2017 and we have some meticulously well crafted affordable phones recently: the new Galaxy A series are polished to perfection (admittedly, they are more expensive), and similarly priced phones like the Sony Xperia XA and Moto G5 have a slightly more refined design. The Lenovo K6 series are not on par with those higher standards: comparatively, they feel lackluster in terms of design. What is wrong with them? The three capacitive keys right below the display look oversized and offhand on the K6 (they do look fine on the K6 Note), there is a hollow feel when you type on the on- screen virtual keyboard, the metal on the back is complemented by cheap plastic antenna strips, the design lacks in curves and is not particularly ergonomic, and all these things come together in a way that is not great. And what was it about placing the microUSB charging port on the Lenovo K6 up top? It feels wrong and weird, and while it is not likely to be a dealbreaker for the hard-headed budget buyer, it is just inexplicable. Thankfully, the K6 Note has its microUSB port on the bottom, where it belongs. And there is no water-proofing on either phone , in case you were wondering. On a more positive note, the fingerprint scanner on the back of the two phones is really fast and very accurate. Both phones have IPS LCD screens: a 5” Full HD one on the K6, and a 5.5” Full HD panel on the K6 Note. We have no issue with the choice of resolution: both appear sharp, but Lenovo could have put a little more effort into balancing the colors. You have two display color modes to choose from: one with vivid, punchy color, and one with more neutral colors, but both have whites that appear very bluish, and both completely miss color calibration targets, meaning that the colors appear unrealistic. The screens are not terrible, but they are again just not on par with the high-quality displays on other new affordable phones. There is auto-brightness setting on both also (it does the job, but is not always perfectly accurate, so sometimes we found ourselves manually tweaking the brightness) and there is a Night mode that further dims the screens.. 5.59 x 2.77 x 0.32 inches. 141.9 x 70.3 x 8.2 mm. 5.94 x 2.99 x 0.33 inches. 151 x 76 x 8.4 mm. 5.75 x 2.81 x 0.31 inches. 146.1 x 71.4 x 7.9 mm. 5.96 x 2.97 x 0.31 inches. 151.35 x 75.35 x 7.85 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Specifications News [1] Rivals Size it Videos.

Ketan Pratap , 27 December 2016. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Lenovo K6 Note comes at a starting price of Rs. The handset will be available via offline channels. Gadgets 360 rates the phone 7 out of 10. Lenovo launched the K6 Power in India last month, in an attempt to strengthen its portfolio in the sub-Rs. Considering that the company introduced the entire K6 series - Lenovo K6 , K6 Power , and K6 Note - at IFA earlier this year , we're not surprised to see that the next model is already here.. The all-new Lenovo K6 Note is the company's first K-series smartphone to be available exclusively via offline channels, and the company claims that it will be available at 15,000 retail stores in the country. Lenovo also plans to promote the K6 Note heavily for the Tier 1 and Tier 2 markets in India. The K6 Note offers an all-metal body and some decent specifications. The company is also marketing its TheaterMax technology for virtual reality, and Dolby Atmos on the K6 Note. Will the Lenovo K6 Note able to compete with some of the favourites in this segment? We try to find out in our review.. Lenovo K6 Note look and feel When the all-new K6 Note arrived at our office, we first mistook it for another K6 Power ( Review ) unit, because the two have nearly identical boxes. Lenovo told us that the similar retail packaging for the K6 series is intentional. At first glance, the front of the K6 Note also looks similar to the K6 Power, though the screen size is obviously a big differentiator. There is definitely a lot of consistency between the siblings in terms of design.. There are capacitive navigation buttons just below the display, and the volume and power buttons are on the side. The capacitive buttons for navigation do not have backlighting, something we complained about with the K6 Power as well. The hybrid SIM tray, which can fit either two SIMs or one SIM and one microSD card, is on the left. The 3.5mm audio jack is on top, while there are two speaker grilles on either side of a Micro-USB port on the bottom.. At almost 170 grams, the Lenovo K6 Note initially felt heavy for its size, but after using it for a few days, we got used to it. The all-metal design means that the handset feels sturdy, but the rear is also slippery. During our review, we had to be careful while using the K6 Note, especially if our hands were sweaty. Despite the screen size, we were comfortable using this smartphone with just one hand.. The front is dominated by the 5.5-inch display. The back of the K6 Note is where we see the most differences compared to the smaller K6 Power. Straightaway, we see a slight bulge for the rear camera with its dual-LED flash. This did look slightly odd and we wish that it could have been flush with the rear of the phone. While using the K6 Note, we found that the rear camera lens was susceptible to scratches.. The round fingerprint scanner is located right below the rear camera and flash. Two gold lines frame the top and bottom of the phone, and there's some company branding towards the bottom as well.. The 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920-pixel) IPS display on the K6 Note is vibrant and produces really sharp text and colours. The brightness is decent for outdoor use. There is no protection such as Corning Gorilla Glass for the display which seems like a potential weakness considering that competitors do offer this. Compared to the K6 Power, the K6 Note's bigger screen makes it better for watching videos and playing games. Overall, the Lenovo K6 Note felt sturdy. The phone ships with a headset, a power adaptor, a Micro-USB data cable, a warranty card, and a user manual.. Lenovo K6 Note specifications and features The Lenovo K6 Note has the same Snapdragon 430 processor clocked at 1.4GHz as the K6 Power, and we would have preferred something a bit more capable. There are two variants of this phone, one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The former has hit our market first - and is also the one we are reviewing today - with Lenovo saying that the second one will be available soon. The smartphone supports expandable storage via microSD card (up to 128GB).. The K6 Note sports a 16-megapixel rear camera with PDAF (phase detection autofocus) and a dual-LED flash. At the front, the K6 Note retains the same 8-megapixel front camera seen on the K6 Power. Connectivity options on the handset include 4G with VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, and GPS. The K6 Note also includes an accelerometer, gyroscope, proximity sensor, and digital compass.. On the software front, the Lenovo K6 Note runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Lenovo's Vibe Pure UI on top. We liked using it on the K6 Power, and it's still good. Other software features are common across the models as well, including the app lock functionality that allows users to lock any app behind a fingerprint; Dual Apps mode, which lets users have two WhatsApp and other accounts on the same phone; and Fingerprint Snap, which lets the fingerprint sensor act as an alternative shutter button. Overall, Vibe Pure UI is smooth and feels fast with only a small amount of bloatware.. ( Also see : Lenovo's AntVR Headset Is Easy to Use, for VR or Basic Big-Screen Fun ). With the K6 Note, Lenovo is once again promoting its TheaterMax technology and ANT VR headset, which was initially launched with the Lenovo Vibe K4 Note ( Review ) at the beginning of 2016. The headset basically allows users to experience media such as movies, games, and other content with a 100-degree field of view which is almost equivalent to a cinematic experience. It is however worth mentioning that users will have to buy the Ant VR headset separately from Amazon India. We tried the new K6 Note with an Ant VR headset and it worked as intended. One can enable VR mode by long-pressing the power button, or from within the Settings app.. Considering that the Ant VR headset is fairly inexpensive and is built well, the K6 Note offers users a chance to experience VR without spending a bomb. We will however reiterate that Lenovo needs to forge partnerships with content creators to push virtual reality support on its smartphones. For now, users can only experience movies, videos, and some games.. Lenovo K6 Note performance Despite featuring a mid-range Snapdragon 430 processor, the K6 Note was fast enough for our daily requirements. We didn't experience lag while multitasking or while flipping through multiple apps. Games like Dead Trigger 2 and Plants vs. We however noticed slowdowns during video calls on WhatsApp, Skype, and Google Duo, which was unexpected considering that we were using a fast Wi-Fi connection.. We got 44,217 in AnTuTu, which was way above the Lenovo K6 Power's score of 27,372 and the Redmi 3S Prime's 40,250. All three phones are powered by the same Snapdragon 430 processor. We also observed scores of 15fps in GFXbench, 21,063 in Quadrant, and 5.601 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme.. The fingerprint scanner at the back was quick, and unlocked the device even when in standby. Watching videos, movies, and games on the K6 Note was a treat, and the Dolby Atmos audio enhancement makes a noticeable difference. However, we were disappointed with the bundled earphones, which were below average. The Lenovo K6 Note supports VoLTE (voice over LTE) on both SIMs and we didn't experience any call drops due to handset issues.. The Lenovo K6 Note's camera does a good job when it comes to casual everyday shots. The 16-megapixel sensor with PDAF is quick to lock focus. The Smart Composition tool tries to help in different situations, but can be turned off in the camera settings. The app offers various modes including Pro, Panorama, Nightscape, HDR, Fast-motion, and Slow-motion. We especially liked the Fast-motion and Slow-motion features as they increased and decreased the subject's speed. We would have liked the ability to turn these clips into GIFs - other manufacturers such as Gionee have started adding support for GIF creation in their camera apps.. Tap to see full-sized Lenovo K6 Note camera samples. The camera interface is easy to use, and we managed to take some good detailed landscape shots. Macros also appear with decent colour accuracy and details. Images taken in daylight could have been sharper, and edges tended to have noticeable noise when seen on a larger screen. In some shots taken under direct sunlight, we noticed that colours were washed out.. We were impressed with low-light shots. Even in the dark, the camera was able to hold a subject in focus, which is good. Selfies on the K6 Note were decent for sharing casually on social media, but not very impressive overall.. We managed to get 13 hours and 20 minutes of playback time in our HD video loop test, which is decent for a battery of this size. The Lenovo K6 Power, with its smaller display, managed more playback time. In everyday usage with both SIMs active, the K6 Note easily managed to last over a day. It supports fast charging though Lenovo is not promoting this feature. We found that 30 minutes of charging filled the battery up to 50 percent, and the device could be charged fully in under 100 minutes.. Verdict Lenovo is one of the many companies in India that have invested heavily in establishing an online sales presence, and several models in the recent past have been online exclusives. With its new K6 Note however, the company wants to reach customers who like purchasing phones offline. The K6 Note offers a large screen and a basic VR experience through the affordable Ant VR headset, which is a great feature even if it isn't always practical. We like this phone's build quality and display, but we still would have liked a more powerful SoC.. 13,999, the Lenovo K6 Note will be competing against the similarly priced Moto G4 Plus ( Review ) and will also have to fend off the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 ( Review ) which is priced lower and offers good overall performance..

Lenovo has been working overtime at releasing smartphones with new models from multiple series being launched in a. The company had previously launched the Lenovo K6 Power in the last week of November, before launching K6 Note. Lenovo Vibe K5 was launched back in August after the company launched Lenovo Zuk Z2 Plus .. The company wants to flood the Indian market with budget smartphones so that people buy smartphones made by Lenovo. K6 Note is another attempt by the Chinese company to break through in the budget segment in the Indian smartphone market. So without further delay, lets see how the Lenovo K6 Note fares.. Lenovo K6 Note is a good looking device with a metal back and glass front along with plastic top and bottom on the back. The smartphone is well-built and sturdy without any squeaking parts. It feels good to hold in hand even though it does tend to be a bit slippery.. The screen size may make it difficult for one hand usage, but that is the case only when you are trying to reach something on the diagonally extreme corners with your thumb.. Lenovo K6 Note comes with the volume rocker on the top right side corner of the smartphone and the power button a little below volume rocker, towards the middle. You will find the speaker grill and the microUSB v2.0 port on the bottom and the 3.5mm headphone jack on the top side of the smartphone towards the right.. The left size towards the top of the smartphone houses the Dual Nano SIM slot where the second slot can be used as an expandable microSD card slot.. The design for K6 Note is nothing out of the ordinary. The imprinted icons of buttons towards the bottom of the screen are ugly in my opinion and kill the chance for the company to add a layer of customisability where consumers can alter the buttons according to their preference.. 5.5-inch Full HD display and is powered by an Octa-Core Snapdragon 430 processor clocked at. There are memory options available on the smartphone: 3GB and 4GB RAM with an internal storage of 32GB. The device we tested had 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage. Both the versions offer the ability to expand the storage using a microSD card of up to 128GB. The device is about 169 gm in weight with 151 x 76 x 8.4 mm dimensions.. camera sensor at the back with PDAF and a dual tone LED flash along with an 8MP shooter on the front. Connectivity options include dual-SIM support, 4G LTE, Bluetooth 4.1, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, GPS/A-GPS and a microUSB v2.0 port. Other notable features include Dolby Atmos audio technology, accelerometer, gyroscope, proximity, compass and. The phone is expected to ship with Android 6.0 Marshmallow (with a custom skin) and. A 5.5-inch IPS LCD panel with Full HD resolution does not offer anything great except the ease to read and use K6 Note under sunlight. The display is average and will not impress you much as the colour reproduction is not impressive. Even though the smartphone does provide a vibrant mode, despite extended usage in the vibrant mode the colours seemed washed out. Once I switched to Normal mode, the display turned from normal to just bad. Viewing angles are quite good though.. One thing to note is that the display settings do provide an option of 'Brightness protection' which is Lenovo's take on 'Night mode'.. However, Lenovo just puts a software overlay on the screen to emulate the effect, and there is no real night mode happening.. The contrast ratios of the display are not up to the mark with a hint of very faint blue tint over the entire display, which may bother people who want accurate colour production. Another thing that I noticed was the fact I had to regularly wipe the display to remove fingerprints despite using the phone with clean hands on most occasions.. Lenovo K6 Note runs a skinned version of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with Vibe Pure skin. The skin is not as comprehensive as Xiaomi MIUI or Samsung TouchWiz, and you can still see hints of stock Android while using the software.. The company has added some useful tweaks like 'Feature' that include Quick snap, double pressing any volume keys to take a picture when the screen is off. Knock to wake, Smart Scene, Wide touch, Fingerprint snap, VR Mode Switch, Dual app profile a feature that lets you run apps under two different accounts.. You can have WhatsApp running with two separate registrations, for example. The skinned UI does include a 'Theme Center' where you can apply different themes to change the look for the software.. Other features include Quick flashlight, decrease tone volume, Ultimate Power Saver and Secure zone management, a sandboxing mechanism which is almost equal to creating different profiles on the smartphone.. The device did come preinstalled with some bloat and does not provide you with a neat experience, and one interesting thing is that the pre-installed McAfee Security terms 'Theme Center' by Lenovo as a threat. All of the things added are spread over a different type of age groups and target groups and may not appeal everyone. But one thing to note is that the company needs to improve the software optimisation to improve the overall sluggish experience.. this is what I can say after using it for almost two weeks now. Which is surprising for its price-point and a smartphone with Octa-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 and 3GB RAM as its internals. The device scored 636 in the GeekBench 4 Single-Core test and 1972 in the Multi-Core Score test. The device also scored about 44378 in the AnTuTu Benchmark which makes it figure quite low in the ranking when compared to devices launched in 2011 (iPhone 4s) for example.. Waiting for tasks to complete after the action has been executed, like waiting for the app to load while switching using multitasking mode, waiting for the keyboard to popup are normal. Even though the delay is small, over time it adds up and leads to. One interesting thing to note is that the device did not get heated up during the extended period of testing except for the rare times when it was continuously pushed to its limits. The smartphone did run the games like Asphalt 8, but there was a noticeable lag while playing.. The calling experience and voice quality is great on the device with no issues in the clarity of the sound or the reception. The speaker grill is available on the bottom side of the smartphone which does not hinder the sound while playing music. Even though the level of sound of the speakers is good, still it can drown in a considerably large hall with background noise. The smartphone scored 3383 in the PCMark Work 2.0 performance test and 9512 in the Ice Storm Unlimited test.. One thing to note is that the fingerprint sensors on the back of the device are fast and very accurate with no problems at scanning the fingerprints from any orientation possible.. Budget smartphones do not really build up much anticipation in the camera department, and the K6 Note was no different.. I was a bit impressed with the quality of images, contrast and colours of the photos in ideal conditions with sufficient daylight but the good part ends there.. The images were a mess in low light with a grain-fest that painted the entire photos. Software does not seem to be optimised to adjust ISO and shutter speed as most photos had motion blur along with excessive noise in low light conditions.. The HDR mode on the smartphone is terrible as the final images seem to have a 'surreal' filter applied to them to make the colours look vibrant and very unnatural.. One important to thing to note is that most of the times I found images out of focus and had to clean the rear camera module glass to ensure that the pictures were in focus. The camera module on the front is also very ordinary, and you won't be astonished by the photos just like the sub-par photos taken by the rear camera.. Considering the quality of the images I had to double check if the rear camera is indeed 16MP. Don't expect much except decent photos during the day.. Lenovo K6 Note is equipped with a 4,000mAh non-removable lithium-polymer battery which is good to know considering that almost all companies are packing larger batteries in budget devices. Despite the capacity, the battery life provided by Lenovo K6 Note is impressive. The device ended up giving me a battery life of about 7.5 hours during a typical work day.. The normal day included 2.5-3 hours of music, 4-5 photos, constant internet usage over 4G and about 1 hour of gaming with a lot of WhatsApp and Telegram messages. The smartphone scored about 10 hours and 21 minutes on the battery intensive PCMark Work battery life 1.0.. One thing to note is that the smartphone software warns you of the mobile apps that are using a considerably high amount of battery. The software feature 'Background app management' prompts you to continue using that app or stop the app.. K6 Note also has inbuilt 'Ultimate Power Save' which disables everything except calling and messaging, thereby increasing the standby time to days. The software also has redesigned 'Power Consumption Details' which let you see what apps are using the battery in a more comprehensive way.. Another important thing is that K6 Note comes with a microUSB 2.0 port and does not come with the latest Type-C reversible USB port. K6 Note does not come with fast-charging. Instead, the company has (thankfully) opted to include a power adapter that provides 5.2V charging capacity at 2A. This somewhat helps the situation instead of the painful experience of charging with a power adapter providing charging at 1A.. The Lenovo K6 Note with 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage starts at Rs 13,999 in the country. The price has not dropped since its launch. But after having used it extensively and seen the performance, I would suggest that you go for Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime as it is both powerful as well as provides a far greater value for money. If you don't want to go for Xiaomi then you can go for Moto G4 or Moto G4 Plus ..
