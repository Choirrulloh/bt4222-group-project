While the hardware is rivaling the S6, this device wont give you anywhere near as much freedom to fully make use of it. There are no tools such as Odin and there is a lack of documentation, which makes i.... the ram is 4gb but the battery below 3100 mah..anyone can give comment about it..tq. Try manual mode,then x600 is useless,i said this because i have x900 and pro 5, front camera is better on x900.

A large, 5.7-inch phone, the Meizu PRO 5 is a phone destined first and foremost for China. It lives up to the ‘pro’ name with its hardware: it features the Exynos 7420 system chip that powers the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note5, one of the best performing chips out there. In terms of connectivity, the Pro 5 features a new baseband for ‘4G+’ connectivity (300Mbps) and it also brings Voice over LTE (VoLTE) support. It’s also notable, that the Pro 5 comes with USB Type C connector with fast charge support -- the phone charges to 65% in just 30 mins (the charger supports up to 12V).. Meizu Pro 5 Review Meizu PRO 5 benchmarks. Dimensions: 6.17 x 3.07 x 0.30 inches (156.7 x 78 x 7.5 mm). Weight: 5.93 oz (168 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 5.7 inches. Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 3), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Sapphire crystal lens cover, Autofocus (Phase detection, Laser), CMOS image sensor. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Geo tagging. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 2100 MHz, ARM Cortex-A57 and ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular Data: LTE-A Cat 6 (300/50 Mbit/s), HSPA, HSUPA, UMTS. Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Compass, Hall (for flip covers).

GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

more ... more .... more ... more .... 2 Interface, Functionality and System performance. posted by Luis D.. 1 Introduction, Design and Display. 2 Interface, Functionality and System performance. 4 Battery life and Conlusion. Introduction This summer, Meizu launched the MX5 — an ambitious handset that made a wonderful first impression before revealing itself as a slick-looking bundle of compromises. Fast forward to November, and Meizu is already in for a re-match with the Pro 5. Put in a few words, this phablet is the result of the very same pursuits, executed with twice the ambition. If there's any question about the Pro 5 that most needs to be answered, that would be whether the bigger screen , top-shelf internals, and updated user experience are worth the $150 price premium over the three-month old MX5. Let's dig in and find out, shall we! In the box: Meizu Pro 5 SIM tray ejector tool USB Type-C cable Charger (12V/2A) Quick start and warranty information Design A feeling of precision is undermined by a bulging camera. Those who know the Meizu MX5 won't be in for any surprises, for the Chinese maker threads the path of incremental improvement. Whipping out the phablet in front of an unsuspecting audience still produces the recurring exclamation of "my, that's a big iPhone you have!" This has sparked some entertaining conversations for sure, but like the MX5 before it, the Pro 5 is no laughing matter. Rather than opulence, this industrially-beautiful smartphone (sold in Gold, Gray, and Silver) stands out with intelligent design. The back panel and sides are mostly made of polished metal that's decorated with chamfered lines where the body meets the front panel. The antenna bands on the back look like they are carved in the aluminum, but the handset's top and bottom parts are actually made of plastic. Thankfully, this doesn't make for an inconsistent look. Moreover, the phablet's sides are gently rounded, which contributes to a comfortable grip, while the power and volume keys on the right are slim, don't wobble, and produce a satisfying "click". Speaking of comfort, the phablet measures a sizable 6.17 x 3.07 x 0.30 inches (156.7 x 78 x 7.5 mm) and weighs 5.93 oz (168 g). Although the Pro 5 is a bit larger than other devices in its category, like the Samsung Galaxy Note 5, it feels very nice in the palm with its flat back and uniform weight distribution. Thankfully, the upgrade in screen diagonal hasn't decreased the efficient screen-to-body ratio — a Meizu trademark of sorts — all that much With its 5.4-inch screen, the MX5 stood at 74%, while the Pro 5 and its 5.7-inch display stand at 73.3%. Obviously, someone knew what they were doing! Meizu worked to high standards in designing and building the Pro 5, but saying the team left no stone unturned would make for an insincere compliment. The Home button feels mushy, and the camera hump on the Pro 5's back undermines the handset's aura of precision. It sticks out too much, propping the phablet upwards when it should be laying flat, and exposing itself to friction damage over time. Hopefully, the sapphire protective lens and metal ring will prove themselves durable over the course of your Pro 5 ownership. Display An AMOLED panel with too much green and not enough brightness. The Meizu Pro 5 is equipped with a 5.7-inch AMOLED display, covered in Gorilla Glass 3. It's set to a 1080p resolution, which still looks more than fine, even when blown up over a plus-sized screen like this one. With its maximum brightness output of 327 nits, the Pro 5's display is rather dim in comparison with other hi-end smartphone displays, and using it under bright light will make you squint. But the minimum brightness of just 1 nit makes for a great bedtime phone. Turning our attention to color accuracy, at 7614 Kelvin, the color temperature is on the colder side, and although temp can be adjusted with a slider, color balance still remains problematic. With the Pro 5, green is very prominent and over-saturated at the expense of seriously subdued red, while yellow is shown as yellow-green. This makes images appear a bit lifeless. Viewing angles are also flawed, as even slight shifts and tilts immediately result in color distortion (the white turns to blue).

The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart.

(Posts: 51; Member since: 11 Jun 2012). posted on 14 Dec 2015, 10:31. First time i totally disagree with phonearena. Sure, Meizu pro 5 is not perfect, but let me tell you something: great battery life, good design, best cpu/gpu on the market, works - fluently and (surprise surprise, phonearena) it's comes officialy into Eu market (from december 19, amazon uk starts selling it) from 349£ 32gb to 389£ for 64gb version. Maybe it's not bargain, but it's way way better deal than, for example, nexus 5x. In my opinion Meizu Pro 5 scores 8.5 easily..

Ok, I never used this exact phone - but I am using the much cheaper Meizu M2 Note, and it runs almost the same OS (Flyme 4.5.4.1i, which is the most recent currently). So, that said, I do have some niggles, such as:. 1) You have one 'master' volume control for both the phone ringer volume and for the notification sounds (Whatsapp, Telegram, emails etc). This is annoying when you are trying to discreetly chat using a messenger app in the office for example - but still want a powerful ringer volume for those times when you are walking in a noisy street with your phone in your pocket - without having to constantly tweak the volume. 2) I haven't had a phone since the late 90's that didn't support the feature of having separate ringtones for different contacts in my address book - until now. Seriously, this is a simple feature and a massive oversight. You can have only one 'master' ringtone for all contacts, and this is annoying. I have found no way to fix this in either the general sound settings or the contacts menu. 3) Flyme OS updates have not been painless. You generally need to back up your data and then entirely reset the device after every update and then re-install all of your apps (though in fairness, either the last update addressed this issue - or I was just 'lucky' after having to do it for the previous 2 updates). Otherwise, on the positive side, the Flyme OS does have some cool and useful features that you may very well find to be useful and even surprisingly so, so it's not all bad by a long shot. Personally I am also happy with the hardware and performance of my M2 Note overall, and at least the OS updates are semi-regular as they gradually improve it over time - plus it is easy to root and you can just go with pure Android quite easily if you want to (I didn't try this yet). My point here is that there are some glaring software omissions and software design mistakes in the Flyme OS that for many people may well justify a lower rating than expected based solely on the HW specs - at least until they are (hopefully) fixed with a future update from Meizu. I am happy with my M2 Note and it runs most 'moderately heavy' apps with no issues at all - but it was also incredibly cheap (about $130), and my expectations are set accordingly. If I was laying out (much) more cash for this Pro 5 however, I think that the issues mentioned above would be more annoying by a similar factor. That's my 2 cents on the subject. Draw your own conclusions based on whatever is most important to you, but I think that Flyme isn't 100% mature quite yet, but you can tell that it is definitely heading in the right direction with a nice UI and some cool features built in. They just overlooked a couple of the basic ones.. (Posts: 354; Member since: 04 Dec 2013). posted on 15 Dec 2015, 03:52. Hey, thanks for chiming in and sharing your experience in detail! Indeed, awesome as it is, Flyme OS is work in progress and it doesn't have the kind of "smooth sailing" factor that would have easily upped the Pro 5's review score into the 8's. However, Meizu is definitely on the right track with its software and devices and I'm sure they will hit a home run eventually. The Pro 5 is my daily driver right now and I'm pleased with the experience, but I do think the Nexus 6P's release made for an unfortunate timing for Meizu. (Posts: 5; Member since: 14 Dec 2015). posted on 18 Dec 2015, 11:19. The biggest problem with Meizu is the International version of their firmwares receive updates at a very slow rate compared to the Chinese one. I went for the Chinese one and the Pro 5 is running Flyme 5.1. The UI is much smoother and the 'Settings' Menu is not a mess as before. Installing Google play is so easy on the Chinese version too. Google installer can be downloaded directly from the Meizu App Centre that comes with the phone. This is also my daily driver now since 3 weeks and everything has been amazing since Flyme 5 but I did notice a drop in battery performance on Flyme 5 compared to Flyme 4.5.

If you means in terms of translation everything is great with no mistakes I could notice for now. The chinese version also has several other languages other than Chinese and English. Only built in apps are in Chinese such as Meizu's app centre or the theme store. * Some comments have been hidden, because they don't meet the discussions rules.. Want to comment?

Meizu Pro 5 review The best flagship smartphone from Meizu to date. by Lanh Nguyen December 11, 2015. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. With its full metal unibody construction, beautiful display, solid battery life, aggressive pricing, and processing package that is arguably the best right now, the Meizu Pro 5 is a fantastic flagship offering that should certainly not be overlooked.. Best bang for your buck Chinese smartphones – 2015 edition. Processor 2.1 GHz octa-core Samsung Exynos 7420. RAM 3/4 GB (depending on storage option). expandable via microSD card up to 128 GB. Camera 21 MP rear camera with laser autofocus. Dimensions 156.7 x 78 x 7.5 mm. Young guns: 10 up and coming phone brands out of China. A now almost standard trend in the Android smartphone world is the presence of “Pro” or “Plus” iterations of popular flagships, with this suffix not only indicative of a bump in size, but, as seen with a lot of such devices, a boost in specifications and features as well. Meizu has jumped on the bandwagon with the Meizu Pro 5 , and while the Chinese OEM may have dropped the MX moniker, the Pro 5 is essentially the larger sibling of the flagship. What does this Pro iteration bring to the table? We find out, in this in-depth Meizu Pro 5 review!. As mentioned, the Meizu Pro 5 is basically a larger version of the previously released MX 5, and retains the design language of its flagship counterpart, with its metal unibody construction and rounded corners and sides. The device is thin and relatively lightweight, and as you would expect from a full metal body, feels solid in the hand. While the rounded sides do make the device comfortable to hold, it doesn’t offer much in the way of grip, making for quite a slippery device.. Taking a look around the device, the power button and volume rocker are on the right side, and the buttons feel solid, while offering a good amount of tactile feedback. Up top is the headphone jack, and on the left is the dual SIM tray, with the secondary SIM slot also functioning as a microSD card slot. At the bottom is a single speaker, and the charging port, this time of the USB Type-C variety, making Meizu one of the few OEMs to adopt the latest standard.. You won’t get any capacitive or on-screen navigation keys with the Pro 5. solitary home button instead, which functions as a back button with a light tap, and also a sleep/wake button with a long press. The home button is very easy to press, but doesn’t offer a lot of tactile feedback, and actually feels kind of cheap, which is surprising, given the otherwise solid build quality of the device.. Of course, as has also been the case with their previous smartphones, Meizu’s design inspiration is pretty obvious when looking at the Pro 5, with the device sharing more than a few common elements with the iPhone. But despite not being the most original design, the Pro 5 is still a sleek and attractive device.. The Meizu Pro 5 sees a 0.2-inch bump in display size when compared to its flagship sibling, with it featuring a 5.7-inch AMOLED display. The display resolution remains at 1080p however, resulting in a pixel density of 386 ppi. Quad HD may have been expected with the larger display and the Pro moniker, but Full HD more than gets the job done in this case. Text and graphics are still very sharp and easy to read, and media consumption remains a joy with the additional screen real estate that is available. As is often the case with AMOLED screens, colors are bright, vibrant, saturated, and full of contrast, and the viewing angles are also excellent. All of it is covered with a 2.5D glass panel featuring. subtle curves along the edges, and blending in quite well with the curved sides of the Pro 5.. In a rather surprising move, the Meizu Pro 5 is powered by the same processing package seen with the current generation Samsung flagships, with the device featuring an octa-core Exynos 7420 processor, clocked at 2.1 GHz, and backed by the Mali-T760MP8 GPU, and 3 or 4 GB of RAM depending on your choice of storage. We all know how powerful and efficient this processing package can be, and it’s a great move by Meizu to use it with their flagship smartphone as well.. As expected, the Pro 5 flies through basic functions and everyday tasks, and everything from scrolling, swiping between homescreens, and opening and closing apps, to more processing-demanding activities like gaming and multi-tasking are handled very well. The Meizu Pro 5 is definitely no slouch in the performance department, and no matter what you throw at this phone, it is not going to let you down.. 32 GB or 64 GB are the built-in storage options available, which, as mentioned, also determines the amount of RAM you get. storage via microSD by up to 128 GB, but with the second SIM slot doubling as the microSD card slot, users will have to make a choice between expandable storage or dual SIM capabilities.. The Pro 5 comes with a standard suite of connectivity options, including 4G LTE. However, LTE band support is quite limited, which restricted my internet speeds to HSPA+ on the T-Mobile network. While still fast, the probable lack of 4G LTE support is something to keep in mind for consumers in the US.. The single speaker unit at the bottom gets surprisingly loud, and the sound quality is actually quite decent as well. However, its placement means that it is very easy to cover up when using the device in the landscape orientation, especially while playing games, and the audio gets muffled easily. The Pro 5 also comes with built-in Hi-Fi audio, allowing for a much better audio experience when using headphones, which is great for those who use their smartphones as the primary music players.. The Pro 5 comes with a fingerprint scanner embedded into the physical home button up front that is very easy to use, and features a tap and hold setup process similar to what is seen from the likes of Samsung and Apple. It is fast and reliable enough, and while there aren’t any major issues while using it, this isn’t the most accurate fingerprint scanner that I’ve come across. It does unlock the device on the first attempt the majority of the time, and fails to do so maybe only 2 out of every 10 attempts, which isn’t too bad, and certainly not enough to completely ruin the experience.. The Pro 5 comes with a large 3,050 mAh battery, that allows for really good battery life. The screen-on time consistently passed the 4 hour mark even with a lot of gaming and watching videos on YouTube, and with moderate usage, it wasn’t difficult to get up to a day and a half of use out of the device. The Pro 5 also comes with fast charging capabilities via Meizu’s mCharge 2.0 technology, which results in the battery charging up to 65% in just 30 minutes.. The Meizu Pro 5 comes with a 21 MP rear camera with phase detection and a laser auto focus system. The sensor is made by Sony, which is usually a good sign of the phone being capable of producing good looking photos, and that is true with the Pro 5, for the most part. In adequate lighting, the device can take some great looking shots, with plenty of color, detail, and sharpness. HDR image processing also brightens up the image further, and brings back a lot of hidden details from the shadows, without looking unnatural.. However, as lighting conditions worsen, image quality deteriorates as well, and rather rapidly at that. Images begin to look soft and muddy, and with very little detail, and the camera also tends to overexpose, leading to a lot of overblown highlights.. What really cripples the camera experience with the Pro 5 is the camera application itself. The app is pretty simple and straight forward to use, but the entire interface is tailored for use in the portrait orientation, and doesn’t rotate when switching to landscape, making for an extremely cumbersome experience. Further, common modes like HDR are buried within the camera settings, and when using the camera in the landscape orientation, switching between different modes is a slow process. The camera interface does work very well when taking selfies with the 5 MP front-facing camera though, but things are much less desirable when it comes to using the primary shooter.. On the software side of things, the Meizu Pro 5 is running the latest version of the Flyme OS, based on Android 5.1 Lollipop. However, you will be hard-pressed to find any Material Design elements across this user interface, or even some aspects of the general Android experience that you may be used to, such as the fact that there is no app drawer to be found, leaving users dependent on folders to keep things organized.. That said, the UI is actually quite clean, with some nice transparencies and minimalistic looking icons, and isn’t overly colorful like some other user interfaces out there. The Flyme OS may not be your typical Android experience, but it doesn’t try to overwhelm you with features either, with just a few built in to keep things interesting. Most of these features are gesture-based, including double tap to wake, swiping downwards to bring down the notification shade, or drawing different characters on the screen to open up various applications.. There is also what Meizu likes to call Smart Touch, which essentially puts a virtual joystick of sorts on the display, that can be re-positioned anywhere on the screen. It can be configured to perform a variety of actions, some of which are identical to the gesture controls, such as double tap to close an application, swipe left or right to switch between tasks, and open the notification drop down, just to name a few.. The Meizu Pro 5 is currently priced at $513 for the 32 GB (and 3 GB RAM) version, requiring an additional $60 for the 64 GB and 4 GB RAM iteration.. So there you have it for this detailed look at the Meizu Pro 5! Meizu is generally known for their affordable smartphone offerings, and while affordable certainly isn’t one of the ways to describe the Pro 5, it is still quite aggressively priced for all that it offers. While this device isn’t ideal for US consumers due to the lack of 4G LTE support, it is certainly a great choice for those in other markets around the world. With an all metal construction, a beautiful 5.7-inch display, a fingerprint scanner, and a processing package that is arguably the best. right now, the Pro 5 is easily the best flagship Meizu has released to. date, and should certainly not be overlooked..

This Chinese smartphone is almost perfect, except for one thing... Android , china , Gadgets , meizu , Meizu Pro 5 , Mobile , reviews , smartphone , Tech. By Victoria Ho 2016-03-02 02:00:43 UTC. Phones coming out of China are getting better and better, and the Meizu Pro 5 is one beautiful piece of machinery.. Sadly, while the flagship device is undoubtedly well-made, it's entirely let down by Flyme OS , Meizu's custom Android interface that comes installed on the phone.. See also: 10 ways to squeeze more battery life from your Android phone. First, a little background about Meizu : The 13-year-old company began as an MP3 device maker (remember those?) before it decided to move to making smartphones in 2007. Since it started, it's been steadily targeting the high-end with phones that boast advanced features and expensive components relative to what you can typically get for the cost.. In China, Meizu is a far smaller player than larger names like Xiaomi , but has continued to carve out its niche as a maker of high-performance yet competitively-priced devices.. The Meizu Pro 5, which sells for $500 (64GB) and $450 (32GB), is no exception.. The phone has a unibody brushed-metal housing that feels great in the hand; it has solid, smoothed edges. It's about the same size as an iPhone 6S Plus , but just a tiny bit thicker. In Asia, there's a growing preference for larger devices that are still easy to hold with one hand.. Side-by-side with an iPhone 6S Plus (left), the resemblance is rather uncanny.. The Pro 5 is Meizu's flagship, and as such it's been generous with the device's specs. The 5.7-inch Super AMOLED display is crisp and bright. The phone's powered by the same Exynos 7420 that also powers Samsung's flagship Galaxy S6 phone and Note 5 phablet , so it certainly packs a punch. It ships standard with 3GB of RAM, but power users may want to opt for the 4GB version.. Meizu Pro 5 (left), iPhone 6S Plus (right). As with its previous models, Meizu has also put in some newer features, such as a USB Type-C charging port. This is a step in the right direction — USB-C is robust, and it's reversible — but until the rest of the mobile ecosystem catches up, you're going to have to ensure you've got extra USB-C cables lying around if you want to charge your phone while you're at the office or in the car.. Sideview of the Meizu Pro 5.. Meizu certainly didn't scrimp on the one thing that most users care about. The 21-megapixel rear-facing camera is accompanied by a 5-megapixel front-facing snapper for selfies.. Its rear sensor (the digital "film" that captures the image) is a Sony-made BSI (backside illuminated) sensor, and Meizu's fitted a decent f/2.2 aperture lens on top of it. Meizu says its autofocus technology relies on phase detection and is laser assisted, geek speak for fast autofocusing. In my experience, the autofocusing was pretty quick; the camera didn't need to hunt, trying to focus on something most of the time. Occasionally, the camera missed shots of fast-moving subjects like children or pets, but no camera is perfect.. Against the iPhone 6S Plus's camera, the Meizu Pro 5 held its own. Images right out of the camera had just a wee bit more magenta than the iPhone 6S Plus, but colors were still natural and not displeasing.. Up close with tricky lighting situations such as a bright window scene, the iPhone retained more detail outside. At parts where the lighting is blown-out, the images reveal that the Meizu lens suffered from some chromatic aberration (the purple ghosting at bright parts) and lighting bleeding into dark areas.. Thanks to the BSI sensor, whose design is made to allow more light to hit it, the Meizu also showed decent noise control in dim lighting.. Both the iPhone and Meizu preserved detail in this up-close shot of a plant that wasn't lit well, but the Meizu shot was a little softer. Although the Meizu metered the shot more brightly, a 100% crop of the shot shows that the image was still noise-free.. The speed and reliability of Meizu's fingerprint scanner really impressed me. It's as fast as the improved iPhone 6S scanner, and not as finicky as the earlier iPhone 6's scanner, which was both slower and required a fuller thumbprint to unlock the phone.. Setting a fingerprint — if you have an iPhone, this'll look familiar.. The phone runs an operating system called Flyme, Meizu's version of an Android fork called YunOS that was made by Alibaba. The custom skin clearly has its heart in the right place — it tries to simplify and clean up the interface and make the learning curve less steep for new users.. In doing so, Flyme OS ends up resembling iOS in many ways , deliberately or otherwise. Its apps are laid out on its home screen on multiple pages, for instance. This feels a lot cleaner than many Android interfaces, which hide apps away in an "app drawer" and bog down the interface with resource-hungry bells and whistles.. Unlike other custom Chinese versions of Android, which don't support the official Google ecosystem, Flyme OS started offering the Google Play store in 2014 alongside its own alternative app store. As with most unofficial app stores, users should be careful when downloading from there, because you might not recognize a sinister app that happens to make it through.. Although the phone comes with Google Play, it doesn't automatically rely on Google for typical functions like backing up or email (Gmail isn't the default client). I still decided to manually download Gmail, mostly because Flyme OS's email app was so unintuitive. The Flyme OS email app expects the user to manually input IMAP or POP settings when adding email accounts — does anyone outside of an IT person remember those settings offhand? Even iOS's default email app can figure that out for most popular email services.. Meizu has also chosen not to build in a separate back button, or support it onscreen with a virtual key. So let me save you 10 minutes: Triggering the "back" function (often needed in the Android experience) is done by lightly tapping — not depressing — the physical home button. It's easy now that you know, but took me 10 frustrating minutes to figure it out.. If you're keen to explore a realm outside Android, Meizu's just announced an Ubuntu version of the Pro 5. Same device hardware, but running the Linux OS, which could present more of a challenge for users accustomed to Android and iOS.. For one, Ubuntu's interface is a departure from apps , and instead presents information in what it calls " scopes ." It groups contextual information together, such as restaurants nearby along with weather. With other app-based OSes, you would typically jump into a weather app for weather information, and go to a separate app for nearby restaurants.. Power users might be intrigued by having the Ubuntu name on a phone, but by the looks of early peeks at Ubuntu interface, it appears to be far less intuitive than Android as a whole. The OS itself seems to be less polished than Android or iOS, and suffers from performance issues according to some folks who have tried it out.. Based on the hardware alone, the Meizu Pro 5 is undoubtedly worth the money and will delight users who care about pure performance and specs. But it'll probably be even better for power users who know how to flash the device and install stock Android on it. At least for now, Meizu, leave the software to Google.. Beautiful metal design • Great, crisp screen • Fast fingerprint sensor • Large battery • Great camera. Flyme OS is unintuitive • Software not well-integrated with the Google ecosystem. The Meizu Pro 5 is a high-end phone packed with advanced features, but the company's home-grown Flyme OS holds it back from being great.. About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms.

Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Meizu on Wednesday launched its latest flagship smartphone, the Meizu Pro 5. Priced starting at CNY 2,799 (approximately Rs. 29,000), the Meizu Pro 5 is certainly the top-of-the-line product for the Chinese manufacturer, and the company is offering impressive specifications as well.. The Meizu Pro 5 features the same octa-core Samsung Exynos 7420 SoC as the Samsung Galaxy S6 , Galaxy S6 Edge , Galaxy S6 Edge+ , and Galaxy Note 5 , but there are a few minor compromises such as a full-HD display rather than the QHD displays seen on most other flagship smartphones today. Meizu said this was a conscious decision with the hope to deliver better battery life and overall performance. The base model will have 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and another variant with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage will be priced at CNY 3,099 (approximately Rs. The firm says that while the Pro 5 does not necessarily have top-end specifications, the components all work together well to offer a 'world class user experience'. Gadgets 360 spent some time with the Pro 5 at the launch event in Beijing, China, and we'll see just how true that claim is in our first impressions.. We should note that the Meizu Pro 5 unit that we got to use was loaded with the company's Flyme 4.5 OS based on Android 5.1, and not the Flyme 5 OS that will arrive as a beta update in October, around the time of the phone's launch. The final public release is set for November. Due to the numerous changes the new OS is supposed to incorporate, we are limiting our first impressions of the smartphone to its hardware at the moment.. In terms of build quality and design, the Meizu Pro 5 seems nearly identical to the Meizu MX5, featuring the same aluminium body, though with slightly more curved edges that taper towards the display. The larger Pro 5 is also 0.1mm thinner, though this is not especially evident in reality. The volume rocker and power button on the right panel now sit in a single groove, though the distance between the two remains the same. The left panel features the SIM/MicroSD card slot, while the Meizu logo now sits right below the rear camera's flash on the back panel instead of lower down. The bottom features the same four-hole speaker grille on the right side, and the microphone hole on the left, though this time there's a USB Type-C socket in between them instead of the more typical Micro-USB. Overall, the build quality is pretty solid, and somehow the smartphone feels lighter than its substantial 168-gram weight.. Moving onto the display of the Meizu Pro 5 - the company has used a 5.7-inch Super Amoled screen with a full-HD resolution. While the pixel density is not the highest, at 387ppi, we found the display to be sharp enough, with crisp font and image rendering. Unlike the Super Amoled displays seen on most top-end Samsung smartphones, the colours are not oversaturated, appearing to be more accurate at the cost of being relatively understated. The display of the Meizu M5 Pro is quite bright, and provides good sunlight legibility - though it was admittedly cloudy on the day we tested it. At this point, with Flyme 4.5 OS, there is no saturation adjustment option - something the company might change with the next iteration of the operating system.. The Pro 5's rear camera features a 21.16-megapixel Sony IMX 230 CMOS sensor. We managed to take some photos in cloudy, brightly-lit indoors, and low-light conditions, and also view them on a computer display. In daylight, the photos were sharply detailed and had good colour accuracy. Indoors however, things took a turn for the worse, with very aggressive noise reduction robbing them of some detail. In low light, some noise was still visible despite the use of noise reduction algorithms. Photos taken with the front 5-megapixel camera had a dramatic amount of noise in low light too; not really becoming of a flagship. The front camera did perform better outside in daylight, though the noise reduction was once again apparent indoors. 4K video recordings also exhibited a lot of noise. Flyme 4.5's native camera app had a tonne of adjustment options, and tweaking the manual settings did produce slightly better results than we were able to get in Auto mode. We can only hope the native camera app of Flyme 5 is better optimised for the Meizu Pro 5, and that the company makes some tweaks to its noise reduction algorithms as well.. It's in the sound department that the Meizu Pro 5 really shone. We tested the phone with rock, metal and dubstep tracks using our own earphones as well as the phone's own speakers. We were impressed at the sound reproduction through earphones, with even a flat equalizer producing balanced and punchy audio. This was also surprisingly the case when using the smartphone's speakers, and there was very little distortion at maximum volume - which was quite loud. While the hardware will not change at launch, the Hi-Fi 2.0 software - due with Flyme 5 - was not yet loaded for us to properly explore the adjustment options.. Unfortunately, beyond a very impressive but synthetic AnTuTu (v5.7.2) benchmark score that fluctuated around the 75,000 mark, we weren't really able to put the Meizu Pro 5 through any real-life performance tests. No games were preloaded to check with. However, as can be expected with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and the Exynos 7420 SoC on our 64GB unit, there was no noticeable lag throughout the UI, and touch input was precise as well.. Apart from the hardware home button, there are no capacitve or on-screen buttons to go back or do any other Android navigation. Users instead have to tap the home button to go back, and swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up the app switcher. Holding the home button down for a few moments locks the smartphone. The fingerprint sensor on the Meizu Pro 5, which can recognize up to five fingerprints, worked exceptionally well - taking less than a second to unlock the smartphone, and detecting fingerprints with good accuracy. It only failed to recognise a print if the finger was swiped hastily or unevenly. This was another aspect of the smartphone that stood out, and it can actually be compared with the iPhone 6 in terms of speed and accuracy.. Overall, while we were quite impressed with the Meizu Pro 5 in most respects, the flaws of the camera were shocking, and we hope that Meizu makes changes in this department if possible. At this price point, the smartphone's average camera is a bit of surprise, though we are willing to give Meizu the benefit of the doubt, and will re-evaluate things once Flyme 5 comes out. The smartphone is well designed otherwise, has a good fingerprint sensor, a bright display and excellent audio, all of which make it a snappy phone to use. Of course, we'll reserve our final judgement until the Meizu Pro 5 actually ships, when we can put it through a barrage of tests in our review process..

The dominance of the smartphone market by Apple and Samsung is being challenged by several Chinese brands that are delivering surprisingly well-featured phones for a fraction of the price. Meizu, one of the smaller Chinese OEMs based on sales volume, trails Huawei, OPPO, and Xiaomi in market share, but is gradually building its brand centered around design and build quality.. The Meizu PRO 5 has been available for some time now, and has even been supplanted by the PRO 6 as the company's flagship device, but Meizu plans to continue selling the PRO 5 alongside the newer version for the foreseeable future at a reduced price. The PRO 5 itself follows the MX5 and is the successor to the MX4 Pro, adopting a new naming convention that further separates it from the midrange MX series.. Besides Samsung, Meizu is one of the few OEMs to use Samsung LSI’s Exynos SoCs, and the PRO 5 is the only other phone outside of Samsung’s more expensive Note5 and Galaxy S6 family to specifically use the Exynos 7420. Introduced in 2015, the Exynos 7420 is notable for being the first commercially available mobile SoC to use FinFET technology, which has less leakage than planar transistor technologies and higher subthreshold swing enabling lower overall power consumption. The 7420’s octa-core CPU—consisting of four higher-performing Cortex-A57 cores running at up to 2.1GHz and four lower-performing but lower-power Cortex-A53 cores running at up to 1.5GHz—and Mali-T760MP8 GPU are manufactured on Samsung’s 14nm LPE process.. The PRO 5 comes in two different configurations: one with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 32GB of UFS 2.0 NAND and one that expands memory and internal storage to 4GB and 64GB, respectively. Both configurations support microSD cards to further expand storage.. The Meizu PRO 5 uses a 21MP Sony IMX230 Exmor RS sensor for the rear camera, the same sensor the Moto X Pure Edition uses, paired with a dual-tone LED flash. It also includes a hybrid autofocus system that combines the strengths of laser, phase detection (PDAF), and traditional contrast detection methods—an uncommon feature, especially at this price point—which should give the PRO 5 excellent focusing performance in a variety of lighting conditions. The PRO 5’s rear camera does not support HDR when recording video or offer a 1080p60 recording mode, which is disappointing, but it does record 4K video using the newer H.265 codec, which is something even the most expensive flagships do not support.. Along with the Exynos 7420 SoC, Meizu is also using Samsung’s Shannon 333 baseband processor that supports GSM/EDGE (900/1800/1900 MHz), WCDMA (bands 1/2/5/8), and TD-SCDMA (bands 34/39), but not CDMA2000. It also supports Category 6 LTE speeds up to 300 Mb/s down and 50 Mb/s up with carrier aggregation. The PRO 5’s LTE support is primarily focused on its Chinese home market offering FDD-LTE (bands 1/3/7) and TD-LTE (bands 38/39/40/41). For our readers in the U.S., the PRO 5 will operate on AT&T’s and T-Mobile’s 3G/4G UMTS/HSPA+ networks, but there’s no LTE support.. The PRO 5’s card tray accepts one NanoSIM and one microSD card or two NanoSIM cards. When using both SIM slots, it’s possible to select which one will support 2G/3G/4G networks for voice and data and which one will be for GSM voice only. The slots are Dual Active, meaning you can have two different phone numbers active at the same time, which is useful when using a single phone for both personal and business use or when traveling abroad.. Unlike many other flagship phones that have different hardware models with frequency support tailored to specific regions or carriers, there’s only one model of the PRO 5. Meizu does have two different versions of its operating system, however; there’s a generic international version that comes with Google’s apps and better language support and a Chinese version that lacks Google’s apps but comes with additional apps and services for Chinese customers.. The PRO 5 adopts the same clean design language, materials, and construction techniques used in the MX5. The aluminum chassis has a fine sandblasted finish and generously radiused corners, giving it a comfortable in-hand feel that is very similar to that of an iPhone. The PRO 5 is also nearly the same size as an iPhone 6s Plus despite its larger screen. Compared to the Moto X Pure Edition and Nexus 6P, which both have 5.7-inch screens, the PRO 5 is a little larger than the Moto X overall and essentially the same width and thickness as the Nexus 6P, but comes in 2.6 mm shorter. The PRO 5 is lighter than all three (iPhone 6s Plus, Moto X Pure Edition, Nexus 6P), but still has enough heft and stiffness to give it an aura of quality.. The front is covered in edge-to-edge glass with a small radius around the perimeter where it blends into the polished, chamfered edge of the aluminum chassis. I’m not sure to what specification the aluminum is heat treated, but the used review unit we received already had many fine scratches on this polished chamfer, implying the metal may be a little soft and prone to scratching. Thankfully, the black border around the 5.7-inch screen is very thin, and the bezels along the sides are also reasonably thin.. Centered above the screen is the phone’s earpiece, whose small size relative to the rest of the phone makes it difficult to hear phone conversations sometimes if it’s not aligned perfectly with the ear. This is an issue I’ve noticed on other phablets too, most notably the iPhone 6s Plus.. The ambient light/proximity sensor and front-facing camera are both positioned to the right of the earpiece, with the camera furthest from center. A white notification LED is hidden just to the left of the earpiece.. There’s a physical home button below the screen that also functions as a touch-based fingerprint sensor using Meizu’s mTouch 2.1 technology. The capacitive sensor is supplied by Fingerprint Cards, and works quite well. It has no issues with changes in finger orientation or position, assuming you’ve done your part during the setup process, and even handles mild changes in dampness and temperature. Fingerprint recognition also occurs very quickly. The pill-shaped button itself is surrounded by a polished accent ring, and while it does not feel mushy, it does not provide a positive click either.. The rounded edges flow smoothly into the phone’s back, improving comfort. A 3.5 mm headphone jack and secondary microphone for noise cancellation are located on the top edge, while the primary microphone and single, downward-firing speaker flank a USB Type-C port on the bottom. There’s a card tray on the left edge that can hold either two NanoSIM cards or one NanoSIM and one microSD card. The power button and single-piece volume rocker sit just above the midpoint on the right edge inside a polished groove. The buttons depress with a solid click, but they are not held firmly in place; there’s just a hint of free play.. The prominent feature on the back is the large, circular surround for the rear camera. Located near the top edge, its polished metal ring and sapphire protective lens protrude from the back, but not enough to catch on things when slipping it into a pocket or purse. Just below the camera is a flush-fitting, pill-shaped module for the dual-tone flash and laser autofocus system.. In place of the plastic antenna lines we usually see on all-metal phones, the PRO 5 has polished slots machined into the chassis. These are purely decorative, however, because the antennas are actually hidden behind plastic inserts in the upper and lower portions of the back. The inserts are then painted to match the look and feel of the chassis’ metallic finish. Even though the color does not match exactly in certain lighting conditions, this method of hiding the antennas is less controversial than the method used by the LG G5 .. The PRO 5 comes in four different color combinations, including silver with white front like our review unit, silver with black front, gray with black front, and gold with white front. None of these colors, like the phone’s aesthetic, are flashy or cheap looking. Instead, the PRO 5 has a clean, tasteful appearance not unlike many other metal phones..

Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition – Display. Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition – Software. The Meizu Pro 5 is the latest flagship smartphone to run on Canonical’s Ubuntu operating system. Ubuntu is designed to work across all device types – including mobile, tablets, convertibles and desktops – using a common core code. This is similar to Microsoft Windows 10 Mobile .. However, unlike Microsoft’s code, Ubuntu is totally open source and has largely been developed and improved by the desktop OS’s millions-strong user base. This means the OS is capable of evolving and changing at a great pace and has update cycles that would make most sysadmins weep.. What’s more, the OS’s open nature and support for numerous different coding languages makes it a tweaker’s dream – a fact aided by the Meizu Pro 5’s impressive specifications.. However, as was the case on the BQ Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition tablet, non-coders and tinkerers should approach the Meizu Pro 5 with caution, since the OS’s chaotic nature is a double-edged sword. The rapid innovation has left Ubuntu Mobile with a bugs and problems and, like Windows 10 Mobile, its app offering is lacking compared to that of Android and iOS. Video: Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition review. Meizu isn’t the biggest name in the Western smartphone market, but it actually has a strong track record in creating beautiful – albeit slightly unoriginal – smartphones. The Pro 5 continues with this tradition.. The Pro 5 borrows design elements from a number of handsets, but generally looks like a larger version of the HTC 10. It has a close-to-identical metal rear, white Gorilla Glass-coated front, and its placement of the physical volume and power buttons is at the same point on the phone’s long right side.. Some may argue this makes the phone look a little boring, but I’m a big fan of the Pro 5’s design. The metal gives the phone a top-end feel, and following an accidental drop onto a granite work surface, I can personally attest to the phone’s build quality.. There will be a few folk who will find the 5.7-inch phone a little unwieldy, a fact not helped by its hefty 168g weight, but people accustomed to using phablets will have no problem with the Pro 5 at all.. Meizu has also done a top job with the Pro 5’s screen. The 5.7-inch AMOLED panel doesn’t have the razor-sharp quad-HD resolution seen on top-end Android handsets, such as the Galaxy S7 , but the 1080p resolution is plenty good enough and ensures icons and text look sharp and easy to read.. The AMOLED screen tech also results in colours that pop off the display and blacks that are inky, suggesting the quoted 10,000:1 contrast ratio is accurate. The only downside is that whites fall a little short of those on competing top-end IPS phone screens, such as the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus ..

The screen is more than bright enough to use indoors, but outside in bright sunlight, it rapidly becomes unreadable. Being fair to Meizu, this is an issue I see on 99% of the phones I review, but nevertheless I’d still have preferred to see a little higher maximum brightness.. The Meizu Pro 5’s use of Ubuntu is its headline feature, and on paper makes this device one of the most interesting on the market.. The software is funded by Canonical and is installed on millions of desktops worldwide. In theory, this should make Ubuntu one of the biggest rivals to Android – which also uses the Linux kernel as its core – for open-source app developers’ and users’ attention.. This is especially true when you consider the stellar work that Canonical has done turning Ubuntu into a converged, ubiquitous OS. A converged OS is often viewed as the Holy Grail of software development. It’s a special type of operating system whose core code can run across multiple device categories, including smartphones, tablets and laptops.. This, in theory, will enable companies speed up how quickly they can issue software updates and offer consumers common user experiences across all device types.. As an added bonus it also makes it easier for developers to create apps that work on both desktop and mobile. If any of this sounds familiar, it should: Microsoft made a big song and dance about the benefits of a ubiquitous OS when it launched its converged Windows 10 platform.. In the past I’ve found that, although more than a little buggy, the software has worked a treat. I therefore had high hopes for the Meizu Pro 5, which runs using the same 15.04 version of the software as the Aquaris BQ M10 Ubuntu edition I reviewed earlier this year.. Out of the box, there’s plenty to like about Ubuntu mobile and its “Scope” menu system. Scopes are custom windows that replace the traditional application-focused user interfaces seen on Android and iOS. They aim to intelligently push category-specific information to users. The information is based on the user’s general habits and data taken from accounts linked the the Ubuntu profile, kind of like Google Now.. Scopes aren’t the prettiest user interface around…. Pre-loaded Scopes include basic categories such as Today, Nearby, News, Music, Video and Photos, but more focused Scopes are available on the Ubuntu Store. If you want to take things to the next level, Ubuntu has also made it easy for tinkerers and coders to create their own custom Scopes by adding the functionality to Ubuntu’s software development kit – the tool developers use when creating applications for the OS.. The Scope’s user interfaces aren’t the prettiest designs I’ve seen, but they’re excellent when it comes to functionality. The Today Scope acts as an excellent command centre for information I immediately need.. Paired to my Google, Telegram, and Fitbit account, the Today Scope intelligently showcased everything from incoming events in my diary and weather alerts to a summary of my daily fitness activity, and calls and messages that had come in that day.. But with prolonged use, as I found on the BQ tablet, there are some issues with Ubuntu that make it a poor choice for anyone other than enthusiasts and developers.. For starters, despite Canonical’s stellar work at the back-end – making it easier for developers to create mobile apps for the OS – the Ubuntu Store is still light on key applications. Numerous commonly used services such as Netflix, Photoshop Touch and WhatsApp aren’t in the store. …But the system actually works pretty well. There are freeware or open-source alternatives to most of the apps available, such as GIMP for photo editing and Telegram for protected messaging, but the lack of apps will be an issue for folks used to iOS and Android’s more developed offerings.. The OS also doesn’t support the Ubuntu tablet’s most interesting feature – a dock-free version of Microsoft Continuum. Microsoft debuted Continuum on Windows 10 Mobile allowing users to turn any Windows 10 smartphone with suitably powerful specs into a stripped-down desktop PC using a custom, £70 Continuum dock.. The Ubuntu version of Continuum was awesome on the BQ Aquaris since it didn’t require a dock; you simply had to connect the tablet to a monitor using a micro-HDMI to HDMI cable. Sadly, this feature isn’t present on this phone.. Ubuntu never made any promises about the phone being able to run in desktop mode, but I still can’t help but think the company missed a trick by not adding it.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

The Meizu PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition is a smartphone designed and produced by the Chinese manufacturer Meizu , which runs on Ubuntu Touch. It is an alternative version of the Meizu PRO 5. It was unveiled on February 17, 2016.. 2.2 Hardware and design. Rumors about an Ubuntu-powered edition of the Meizu PRO 5 appeared after photos of a Meizu PRO 5 running Ubuntu Touch 15.04 had been leaked. It was reported that this device would be showcased at the Mobile World Congress in April 2016. The Meizu PRO 5 Ubuntu was officially released on February 17, 2016. [4] International pre-orders began on February 22, 2016 through online retailer JD.com. The PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition is running Ubuntu Touch, which is a mobile operating system based on the Ubuntu linux distribution developed by Canonical. Its goal is to provide a free and open-source mobile operating system and deliver a different approach to user experience by focusing on so-called “scopes” instead of traditional apps.. The technical specifications and outer appearance of the PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition is identical with the Meizu PRO 5. The Meizu PRO 5 features a Samsung Exynos 7420 Octa with an array of eight ARM Cortex CPU cores, an ARM Mali-T760 MP8 GPU and 3 GB of RAM. Meizu Global Brand Manager Ard Boudeling explained in November 2015 that Meizu decided to use the Samsung Exynos SoC because it is “currently [..] the only option if you want to build a genuine premium device”. The Meizu PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition has a full-metal body, which measures 156.7. It has a slate form factor , being rectangular with rounded corners and has only one central physical button at the front.. The PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition is only available in with 32 GB of internal storage and with a champagne gold body.. The PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition features a 5.7-inch AMOLED multi-touch capacitive touchscreen display with a ( FHD resolution of 1080 by 1920 pixels. The pixel density of the display is 387 ppi.. In addition to the touchscreen input and the front key, the device has a volume/zoom control and the power/lock button on the right side and a 3.5mm TRS audio jack , which is powered by a dedicated Hi-Fi amplifier supporting 32-bit audio with a frequency range of up to 192. The PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition uses a USB-C connector for both data connectivity and charging.. The Meizu PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition has two cameras. The rear camera has a resolution of 21.16 MP , a ƒ/2.2 aperture and a 6-element lens. Furthermore, the phase-detection autofocus of the rear camera is laser-supported. The front camera has a resolution of 5 MP , a ƒ/2.0 aperture and a 5-element lens.. While the device itself had been praised for its specifications and build quality, critics have criticized the Ubuntu Touch operating system.. GSMArena stated that ”overall, all the bits and pieces that made the Meizu Pro 5 great are still present, but even on paper, we can already see quite a lot of compromises brought about by the new OS in the Ubuntu Edition at hand”. Softpedia gave the device a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, concluding that they “would recommend [the] Meizu PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition to those who like smartphones with big screens, Ubuntu Phone fans [..], as well as very curious people who get bored easily and always enjoy trying something new”. ^ "Meizu PRO 5 website". ^ "Meizu PRO 5 - Full phone specifications". ^ "Meizu PRO 5 Running Ubuntu Leaks, Launching At MWC?". ^ "Meizu PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition launches globally". ^ "Meizu PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition available for pre-order now". ^ "Why Meizu uses Exynos 7 Octa in PRO 5". ^ "Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition review". ^ "Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition review".

Instead, I set permissions through the app settings screen.. Join Date: Joined: Jan 2013. Works great for me! Seems even more stable. Netflix always crashed on the RR rom.

Samsung Exynos 7420 14nm Next Generation CPU. The Samsung Exynos 7420 is the first mobile chip in the world which applies the 14nm FinFET technology. Compared to the Snapdragon 810 chip,the power consumption is decreased by 35%. For the dual quad-core seamless cooperation of the A57+A53, the basic frequency reaches 2.1GHz and the performance is increased by 20%. In the deployment of advanced HMP (Heterogeneous Multi-Processing) technology,the core can be deployed intelligently based on the amount of calculation task, and each kind of performance will achieve precise squeezing. In traditional cognition, power consumption, heat generating and performance look like a pair of contradictory objects, but they are harmonious in the 14nm next generation technology.. *The data is from laboratory tests. We recommend you to experience it by yourselves.. The strong 8-core Mali-T760 GPU is also based on 14nm FinFET technology and is sealed together with the CPU. The highest frequency may reach 770MHz. If more than that, the PRO 5 also has intelligent AFBC (ARM Frame Buffer Compression) technology, which can save up to 50% of bandwidth for the system. That means that it can decrease 50% of power consumption for the system. Therefore, the rare and strong GPU can take it easy whenever you run large-scale games such as NBA 2K15 and Need for Speed or small games such as Candy Crush on the PRO 5.. Fast UFS 2.0 Far superior than eMMC 5.0. UFS 2.0 adopted by PRO 5 is honored as the future of flash memory technology. It adopts 16nm process technology and supports simultaneous read-write. However, eMMC 5.0 can only perform one-way reading and writing. It is also endowed with the random access performance which can be compared with an SSD and is 4 times that of eMMC 5.0. The volume is the same as eMMC 5.0 and the power consumption is very low. With such a powerful read-write function, the speed for opening the application with PRO 5 is greatly improved. The photo album can be browsed directly without waiting and the 4K high-definition video will be smoother.. LPDDR4 3G/4G Big Memory Say goodbye to background cleaning and sluggish performance. You can run more programs on the PRO 5 simultaneously and quickly switch applications when you want to. It is because we adopted LPDDR4 big memory which is leading in the industry. The basic frequency reaches 1,600MHz and the performance is enhanced completely. The two-channel memory technology can improve the bandwidth by 50% and make it reach 25.6GB/s, thus realizing 1.7 times more running speed compared to the last generation. In addition, low voltage and 20nm advanced processes can save 40% on power consumption. As a result, you can play large-scale games, record 100fps slow motion video or perform 4K shooting freely while downloading movies, logging into WeChat and MicroBlog.. Sensor Hub More intelligent, more energy-efficient. PRO 5 is equipped with a Sensor Hub co-processor, which is also a mini computing center. With a low power consumption, it can efficiently collect data from multiple sensors to monitor the status of your campaign at any time.. 9 am - 9 pm GTM+8. Â©2017 Meizu Telecom Equipment Co., Ltd.

Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition Smartphone Review. Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition Smartphone Review. Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition Smartphone Review. Why an Ubuntu Smartphone? What’s Inside the Meizu Pro5 Ubuntu Edition? What About the OS? Are There Any Apps and Games? Media Playback and Camera Convergence? What Convergence?! How Does the Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition Benchmark? Has Ubuntu’s Time Come in the Mobile Space?. When a phone is released only to a select few enthusiasts, you wonder whether or not the hype. And when that phone is running Ubuntu, a mobile operating system that is yet to take the mobile world by storm (despite many promises from developers Canonical) you begin to suspect that these devices probably aren’t going to be worth the investment.. So is the phone worth it? Let’s find out…. Before we go on, you might want to give a bit of thought to whether a smartphone powered by Ubuntu is really something that you want – especially when there is an Android variant of the same phone with the Flyme5 UI on top .. is a smartphone that comes with its own set of advantages. For a start off, it’s the first mobile device that can be synced natively to any Linux distribution (Ubuntu, naturally). This in itself is a bit of a triumph.. But there’s another reason: a great cause. Windows Phone/Mobile 10 has more or less failed. MakeUseOf Says Goodbye To Windows Phone. MakeUseOf Says Goodbye To Windows Phone. This is going to be a tearful goodbye, buddy, but it has to happen. MakeUseOf will soon be parting ways with Windows Phone. Android and iOS stand proud as the great bastions of smartphone operating systems. If you’ve found yourself dissatisfied with either or both, then perhaps you’ve mulled over the idea of whether a Linux-powered smartphone (genuine Linux, not the Android variety) is a viable alternative.. Along with BQ and Aquaris, Meizu are at the forefront of development of Ubuntu Touch/Ubuntu Phone devices, and while India and China are the territories currently being targeted (where Ubuntu and other Linux operating systems are more widely used), Meizu’s Pro5 Ubuntu Edition is now on sale in the USA and European Union.. So, if you’re looking for some Linux flavored simplicity and a new approach to smartphone UIs, an Ubuntu smartphone might be your next move…. In a world of high end Android and iPhones, an Ubuntu Phone device needs to have a few hardware advantages to get attention. Given that the Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition is also available as an Android device; it should come as no surprise that both devices are equipped with the same hardware.. Well for starters, you’ve got 32GB of internal storage, 3GB RAM, and an 8-core Exynos 7420 processor and MALI T760 GPU. The 168g device sits at 156.7 x 78 x 7.5mm, with a 5.7 inch 1080p AMOLED screen, protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3.. On the right-hand edge of the impressive unibody design are three hardware buttons: power, volume up and volume down. Meanwhile, on the left, the expansion door, where you’ll find slots for two micro-SIM cards (or a micro-SIM plus microSD card), which allow the phone to be used across multiple networks — useful if you’re travelling through different territories.. Meanwhile, Bluetooth, NFC, wireless networking, GPS and all of the usual connectivity options are present. It’s worth reporting that the OS was unable to detect my correct location even with the Wi-Fi/mobile option selected in place of GPS (it was out by around 150 miles!) but this is likely a software bug, rather than the hardware.. The Ubuntu Phone operating system is pretty much an unknown quantity at this point. It comes with all of the tools you would expect to find natively: settings, an update tool, reset etc., calendar, messaging and email support, as well as a couple of well-known apps ( Facebook , eBay , Twitter ), and media playback (see below).. The main Ubuntu Unity menu bar. 3 Dead-Wrong, Yet Common Complaints About Unity & Ubuntu. 3 Dead-Wrong, Yet Common Complaints About Unity & Ubuntu. Do you hate Ubuntu's new interface, Unity? Do you think Ubuntu is making a huge mistake by changing things, and will inevitably crash and burn because of this? There are good reasons to dislike Unity... is opened by swiping in from the left, or pressing the home button (on Android devices, this has thumbprint reader abilities, but this is currently not available on Ubuntu Phone). The information presented on what would otherwise be a “Home” screen in fact feels more like an app, which is swiped through. Here you find Scopes , each focusing on relevant calendar, date, time and weather information at first, while apps, popular music and video and your photos can be found by swiping back and forth.. It can take a while to get used to, but the simplicity of having your apps listed in the same place as your calendar updates and so forth is quite refreshing. As a shortcut, you can swipe up from the bottom of the screen to quickly find an app to switch to, while the notification area displays everything you would expect. Swiping from the right edge, meanwhile, displays the open apps; simply browse between them to switch, and swipe upwards to close.. Data can be easily copied from the phone using a USB Type-C data cable connect to your computer, like any standard USB storage device.. Mobile platforms, rightly or wrongly, live and die on the quality of their apps and games. As mentioned, several popular apps are included in the OS, and support for others is also provided via integrated login (such as Instagram ).. New apps can be found in the Ubuntu Store, where tools as useful as flashlights, two factor authenticators, and even a Terminal can be found. though – it’s hard to filter. apps based on their type, for instance. Games are available – mostly puzzles – but a few popular options are there, such as Cut the Rope (which you can play on other devices, even in your browser ).. There’s certainly enough to keep you entertained and use your phone as a new tool. In many ways, the selection of apps feels like the early days of Android; in less optimistic terms, it also feels a little like WebOS. So You Bought A TouchPad: 5 Uses For Your "Dead" Tablet PC. So You Bought A TouchPad: 5 Uses For Your "Dead" Tablet PC. The dust has settled and by now you should either be bitterly disappointed or overjoyed at the bargain you just snagged. If you were lucky enough to grab yourself a firesale HP TouchPad or are... As you would expect, the Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition ships with front-facing 5 MP and immense 21 MP rear cameras, with a Sony sensor chipping in to make your captures even better. Sadly, while the hardware is good for snapping, the editing software needs some work, although with a new mobile platform that might. The following shots show results from the Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition compared with the Sony Xperia Z5. You're looking for a new phone. Something reasonably powerful, big screen, great sound. A handset to blow your iPhone loving friends out of the water. The Sony Xperia Z5 might just be it. As you can see, there is a bit more color in the Meizu snap. Both photos were taken within seconds of each other on a sunny day at Edinburgh Castle, Scotland.. Media playback, meanwhile, is possible via the videos section of the Home screen, where your own videos and trending YouTube videos can be enjoyed on the device’s full HD 1920x1080p display. It’s a crisp picture, too, but videos recorded on the device don’t tend to be as impressive as the photos (there’s some sample footage in the video review).. Much has been made of the Convergence feature, Ubuntu’s answer to Microsoft’s Continuum (found in the recently-reviewed Lumia 950. This could be Microsoft's final flagship phone. With many declaring Windows 10 Mobile dead on arrival, just what is the point of the Lumia 950?. It’s essentially support for hardware that enables you to turn the phone into a desktop computer, with the addition of a keyboard, mouse, and display.. While Bluetooth is supported, the Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition doesn’t ship with a HDMI port, and the USB Type-C port doesn’t seem to be adequate at this stage for an adaptor. What this means is that one of the main selling points of Ubuntu Touch is unavailable in the most anticipated device since the OS launched.. poor showing, whichever way you look at it.. Benchmarking the Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition is a bit tricky, thanks to the shortage of satisfactory testing software. As a result, any such assessment can only be based on usage.. For a device that shares a processor (the Exynos 7420 processor) with one of the top phones on the market (the Samsung Galaxy S6), the Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition feels lackluster. Perhaps this is down to the inclusion of just 3 GB of RAM instead of the usual 4 GB? Software stability issues mitigate this, with basic games such as Cut the Rope proving buggy, laggy, and ultimately crashing.. Not an ideal mobile gaming experience!. Additionally, while the new gestures can take a bit of time to learn, the OS doesn’t seem to be quite quick enough to pick them up in many cases. When you’re feeling your way through a new user interface, this is far from ideal. On the other hand, battery life is good, offering around 30 hours per charge with average use.. A new operating system on any popular device will take time to take hold. Realistically, outside of the target markets in China and India, Ubuntu Phone has little chance of surpassing even Blackberry and Windows Phone/Mobile 10, never mind Android and iOS.. Ubuntu Phone has its strengths; it has some failings, too. But the Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition is a solid piece of hardware that should appeal to any Ubuntu desktop user and smartphone owners disillusioned with the way things are going with iOS and Android. If Convergence can be brought into the mix on this device, and app stability issues addressed, the Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition could prove an attractive alternative to the marketplace-focused worlds of iOS and Android.. Retailing at $369.99, the Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition is available to buy now. Our verdict of the Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition : A quick phone with a superb camera, let down by a challenging operating system that’s short on apps. Remember, there is an Android model if you prefer.

June 4, 2016 at 11:38 pm. Thank you for the awesome contest and chance to win.I would love to have this phone!! :). June 4, 2016 at 4:27 pm. May 27, 2016 at 9:15 pm. I've seen or read something about it being extra slaggy on opening/starting an app for the first time! Is it truly so?. or its just some Pro-Android/iOS people trashing it down for no good reason?. May 26, 2016 at 7:06 am. This is awesome, i want a magic to win!!!. May 25, 2016 at 6:18 pm. I would love a chance to win this but.... I do not see anywhere to sign up!! I have noticed this on everything that I read for review and giveaway. But I see nothing as to actually signing up for a chance at a giveaway. May 25, 2016 at 6:30 pm. The entry tool is at the top of the page, a few lines below the title.. May 25, 2016 at 8:40 am. Unless the Meizu 5 is a quantum leap over the 4 in terms of both software and hardware quality, this is still just an expensive toy. I bought the 4 and after 3 months of trying very very hard to like it, I got rid of it. The software was laggy as hell and up as far as last november had some serious bugs in basic functionality (copy/paste between apps didn't work, for example!) The picture quality was good, if you could wait the 20secs for the phone to start up, focus, and let you take the shot without the camera app freezing. As for "apps", very quickly you realise that 75% of the "apps" in the ubuntu store are just webapp containers for the mobile sites of whatever the app was (the facebook "app" was just m.facebook.com for example).. And for those thinking "woohoo, linux on a phone, freedom!", it is just as much of a walled garden as android. If you install the terminal and get to the shell, you don't have root access, and / is mounted read-only so you can't install anything, the only way to add new s/w is through the ubuntu store. If you remount as rw, you break app/OS updates until it's mounted ro again.. So, it would be nice to win one to play with it a bit, but if you're looking for a replacement for your current android/iOS phone, keep looking.. May 25, 2016 at 3:49 am. I hope i'm not the only one here who mentally associates Linux with Linus from Linus Tech Tips :D. May 24, 2016 at 2:31 pm. Thanks for the nice review you did. I'm using ubuntu since I bought my first laptop. I have to try this also..... May 24, 2016 at 12:46 pm. I may buy one of these just to play with. But I wanted to make one note. There is no such thing as "genuine linux". All linux distributions are "varieties" and all have their differences. An Android phone is just another linux device with another linux distribution, not some kind of "not genuine" linux (that reminds me of Windows "genuine" crap, shudder). I know, it's probably pedantry, but it's important people realize there's no "genuine" or "core" linux, that means alll other varieties are just copies or knockoffs of some kind. If it's based on linux, it's "genuine".. There's a lot of confusion on this with people coming from the proprietary world.. May 24, 2016 at 8:14 am. :) Features of the phone are amazing.... Thnx "Make use of" for ur contest.. May 24, 2016 at 7:07 am. Great review and giveaway!thanks for the opportunity!. But can t see clearly the code in the video review.. Have been watching the video at least 4 times.. May 24, 2016 at 2:55 am. There is currently a big "window" of opportunity for Linux and, more specifically, for Ubuntu. I hope that they can sort out the issues with this handset and also introduce more products to finally present a serious challenge to the big players.. PS: The phrase "Software stability issues mitigate this" in the review doesn't make sense. May 24, 2016 at 2:26 am. Sounds cool would love to try one..... May 24, 2016 at 2:23 am. I like Ubuntu much more than Android... May 24, 2016 at 2:08 am. Thank you for the awesomeness, the contest, and generosity. May 24, 2016 at 12:59 am. May 24, 2016 at 12:40 am.

As far as I know the convergence feature is planned for the Pro 5. As USB Type C cannot handle it, the developers are working on enabling Aethercast handle the Convergence feature wirelessly..

I would lkke to enter the contest it I don't see anywhere entry form or anything of the like, good review though. I would love to have this phone, been using Ubuntu fr over ten years.. May 22, 2016 at 12:09 pm. I can always use a free phone that does email and 'cut the rope' even if slow.. May 21, 2016 at 7:48 pm. May 21, 2016 at 3:01 pm. I have an older model Meizu Android and I love it. I would give the old one to my brother (who still uses a flip phone) and fire up the Ubuntu.. May 21, 2016 at 12:19 pm. May 21, 2016 at 7:20 am. It's the first of its kind that's not written from the "wether you're with us or against us" point of view. I was to make a decision recently, but experience from 3 years of Ubuntu touch on my Nexus 4 made me go for a Nexus 5x with Android as my primary everyday device. I simply lost hope that Ubuntu Touch will ever be competitive - and I'm not talking about availability of Apps. After all these years it's still buggy and far from running smoothly. But hey, I'm young, I can wait :-). May 20, 2016 at 11:28 pm. Great phone for ubuntu and / or linux users. It would be great to explain how the give away works too.. May 20, 2016 at 10:21 pm. i want to win this amazing phone!!! thanks again for this opportunity!!. May 20, 2016 at 9:53 pm. Very nice yaar features are quite good I love to get this phone.... May 20, 2016 at 9:35 pm. The OS is going through a lot of changes still, this month there’s bug fixes, there’s going to be some speed ups, the scopes are going to be re imagined over the next 6 months, notifications are going to be improved, there’s going to be an update to the messenger app to make it an all in one.. That wont push it much closer to being a competitor though, because of apps, we still need a lot of apps even if the OS is amazing, and thats always going to be the downfall of the phone if we cant change it.. I hear developing for Ubuntu is the easiest, and with convergence it seems like its going to be more interesting to develop for both desktop and phone, I am interested to see where it goes, Ubuntu on the Phone cant fail like some others as if the phone isn't picked up, any change made on the desktop or a lot of apps made for desktop, will automatically come to the phone.. May 20, 2016 at 7:19 pm. Which code we have to enter plz explain. May 20, 2016 at 2:49 pm. Great article! I'm so glad to see more and more press about Ubuntu mobile!. The phone sounds like it lags a little behind Android, but considering the development stage for Ubuntu mobile and the maturity and popularity of Android, it sounds like it is really coming along!. I'm still trying to get the Ubuntu SDK installed on my laptop and try writing something up for it. (Winning the phone would give me more incentive! :) ).

Back Up Every Byte On Your Device. Ready to root your Pro 5? Thanks to One Click Root, rooting has never been safer, easier, or faster. When we called our software “One Click” Root, we really meant it!.. Four Easy Steps to Root Your MEIZU Pro 5. How To Root MEIZU Pro 5 In Minutes. Download and install One Click Root. Connect your Android to your computer. Run One Click Root and let the software. One Click Root Devices MEIZU Meizu PRO 5. Safely Root and Give Your Meizu PRO 5 a Full Blast Functionality. First, a little background about Meizu: The 13-year-old company began as an MP3 device maker (remember those?) before it decided to move to making smartphones in 2007. Since it started, it ‘s been steadily targeting the high-end with phones that boast advanced features and expensive components relative to what you can typically get for the cost.. In China, Meizu is a far smaller player than larger names like Xiaomi, but has continued to carve out its niche as a maker of high-performance yet competitively-priced devices. The Meizu Pro 5, which sells for $500 (64GB) and $450 (32GB), is no exception. Phones coming out of China are getting better and better, and the Meizu Pro 5 is one beautiful piece of machinery. Sadly, while the flagship device is undoubtedly well-made, it ‘s entirely let down by Flyme OS, Meizu ‘s custom Android interface that comes installed on the phone.. The phone has a unibody brushed-metal housing that feels great in the hand; it has solid, smoothed edges. It ‘s about the same size as an iPhone 6S Plus, but just a tiny bit thicker.. The Pro 5 is Meizu ‘s flagship, and as such it ‘s been generous with the device ‘s specs. The 5.7-inch Super AMOLED display is crisp and bright. The phone is powered by the same Exynos 7420 that also powers Samsung ‘s flagship Galaxy S6 phone and Note 5 phablet, so it certainly packs a punch. It ships standard with 3GB of RAM, but power users may want to opt for the 4GB version. The 21-megapixel rear-facing camera is accompanied by a 5-megapixel front-facing snapper for selfies. Against the iPhone 6S Plus ‘s camera, the Meizu Pro 5 held its own. Images right out of the camera had just a wee bit more magenta than the iPhone 6S Plus, but colors were still natural and not displeasing. The speed and reliability of Meizu ‘s fingerprint scanner really impressed me. It ‘s as fast as the improved iPhone 6S scanner, and not as finicky as the earlier iPhone 6 ‘s scanner, which was both slower and required a fuller thumbprint to unlock the phone. The phone runs an operating system called Flyme, Meizu ‘s version of an Android fork called YunOS that was made by Alibaba. Unlike other custom Chinese versions of Android, which don ‘t support the official Google ecosystem, Flyme OS started offering the Google Play store in 2014 alongside its own alternative app store Based on the hardware alone, the Meizu Pro 5 is undoubtedly worth the money and will delight users who care about pure performance and specs. But it ‘ll probably be even better for power users who know how to flash the device and install stock Android on it. At least for now, Meizu, leave the software to Google.. Like any other device, it has its own weaknesses but luckily it isn ‘t that serious and untweakable. Rooting can find its way to more improved usability, accessing the core system, unlocking OS, breaking restrictions to enable modification and customization possible on your preference and needs. With a rooted device, the possibilities and ways of customization is almost near limitless and is highly beneficial. But sadly, gaining root access isn ‘t that easy, it ‘s rather complex, dangerous, and risky. Fortunately, One Click Root made rooting a single-step solution, it ‘s made so easy, simple, fast, and safe. It ‘s 100% safe and reversible, so no worries, be gone.. One Click Root also provides top-notch services like root support to keep you guided all the way through, ensuring you get the right root you deserve in a hassle-free and stress-free way.

January 17, 2016 - Written By Kristijan Lucic. Meizu is one of the most interesting China-based smartphone manufacturers in the last couple of years. This company is one of the fastest-growing smartphone manufacturers in the world, they’ve sold 4.4 million devices back in 2014, and have managed to ship out 20 million last year. Their growth rate is quite staggering, and there’s a good reason for that. Meizu tends to release quite affordable, and yet great devices. Every single Meizu-branded device I’ve encountered was extremely well built, offered great performance and simply did not feel cheap in any way, shape or form, and this time around we get to check out the best of the best Meizu has to offer, the company’s PRO 5 flagship. This device was announced a while back, and we’ve had it for a while, but were waiting for the final Flyme 5 OS update (international version) to become available before we review it, considering that’s the software version that was introduced alongside the device. The update arrived quite recently, and we’ll talk more about it later in the review. That being said, let’s see what Meizu PRO 5 has to offer, read on.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. Meizu PRO 5 is an all-metal phablet which features a 5.7-inch fullHD (1920 x 1080) 2.5D curved AMOLED display with Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3 on top of it. The phone is available in 3 or 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 32/64GB of internal storage (expandable up to 128GB via a microSD card). As a disclaimer, I’ve tested the 3GB RAM variant of this device with 32GB of internal storage on the inside. Samsung’s Exynos 7420 14nm 64-bit octa-core processor is fueling this handset, and is the only smartphone aside from Samsung’s four current flagship device to sport that SoC.. This handset comes with two SIM card slots on the inside (2 x Nano SIM), one of which you can use as your microSD card slot. The 21-megapixel shooter (Sony’s IMX230 sensor, f/2.2 aperture, 6-element lens, PDAF) is located on the back of this handset, and below it you’ll notice the dual-LED, dual tone flash, and the Laser Autofocus. The 5-megapixel snapper (f/2.0 aperture, FotoNation 2.0 smart selfie enhancement) is placed on the front-side of this device, and a 3,050mAh battery is available on the inside of this device, and is not removable. Speaking of the battery, you do get Meizu’s mCharge 2.0 fast charging here, 30 minutes of charging will basically give you 65% of battery.. The PRO 5 is also quite capable in the audio department, it packs in ESS ES9018K2M and OPA1612 chips, which are used in Hi-Fi systems. The NXP PBSS transistor is also packed in here, and the phone’s loudspeaker is located on the bottom of the phone, flanking the Type-C USB port. Android 5.1 Lollipop comes pre-installed on the Meizu PRO 5, and on top of it you’ll find Meizu’s very own Flyme 5 skin. Keep in mind that some versions might ship with Flyme 4.5, but the Flyme 5 is already released, so you should get the update as soon as you power on the device and connect to a Wi-Fi network. The Meizu PRO 5 measures 156.7 x 78 x 7.5mm, while it weighs 168 grams. The device is available in Black Gray, White Gold, Black Silver and White Silver color options.. As mentioned in the specs section, Meizu PRO 5 features a 5.7-inch fullHD (1920 x 1080) AMOLED display, and it looks really, really good. If you love OLED panels and the saturation / contrast they offer, you’ll love this display. The colors are not too saturated, but just enough for you to know that this is the AMOLED display and enjoy its vividness. The display is also sharp enough, it’s quite pleasing to use quite frankly. You do have some options in the software to tweak colors of this panel, if you want, of course. There’s basically a slider for color temperature included in there, and you can set the colors to be colder or warmer, whichever you prefer, I simply used the default selection.. Now, as far as touch responsiveness goes, this is one of the best displays I’ve ever used. The digitizer is great, and the responsiveness of the display is just right, at least it was for me. You’ll get the same quality here, as you’d get with pretty much any other pricier flagship out there, both in terms of sheer display performance and general looks of this panel. It is also worth mentioning that Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3 protection is placed on top of this AMOLED panel, which is always a good thing.. The Meizu PRO 5 is a beautiful device, especially when you actually get to see it in person. Do keep in mind that it’s quite slippery though, the metal is gorgeous and feels great to the touch, but it’s extremely slippery, you might want to think about getting a case for this phone. The rear-facing camera protrudes on the back ever so slightly (a case might help with this as well), and the mTouch physical button is located below the display of this device, as it is in other Meizu-branded devices released lately.. The button itself actually serves as a capacitive back button, hardware home button and a fingerprint scanner. It didn’t take me long to get used to it, and once you do, it’s quite a joy to use. The button itself is quite tactile, and I believe that most of you will like it. The power / lock and volume rocker physical buttons are placed on the right-hand side of this phablet, and they’re made out of the same material as most of this device, metal. The PRO 5 offers a unibody metal design, and two SIM card slots on the left side (2 x Nano SIM), one of which you can use as your microSD expansion slot. The bezels on this handset are also quite thin, but nonetheless, this is a rather large device.. Meizu’s newest flagship is fueled by Samsung’s Exynos 7420 14nm 64-bit octa-core processor. This SoC has been used in only 5 devices in 2015, and 4 out of 5 are Samsung’s flagships. This SoC is considered to be one of the fastest chips on the market at the moment, and in combination with 3/4GB of RAM (3 in our case), and Meizu’s Flyme UI, it provides an incredibly smooth performance.. The general performance was silky smooth, no matter if we talk about web browsing, heavy multitasking, YouTubing, messaging… I really pushed this phone to the limit. The phone was set to ‘Balanced’ mode as far as performance goes, which is the default option. As far as gaming goes, you’ll be able to run pretty much anything on this phone and enjoy it to the fullest, as already mentioned, the Exynos 7420 pushes anything without a hitch, including 3D intensive games like Modern Combat 5, Asphalt 8, Dead Trigger 2 and a couple more titles I’ve tried out.. As I’ve already mentioned, the Meizu PRO 5 features Samsung’s Exynos 7420 14nm 64-bit octa-core processor on the inside. This is one of the best best chips around at the moment, and as far as benchmarks go, only Kirin 950 and Snapdragon 820 are above it. As far as Meizu PRO 5’s benchmarks go, the device managed to score 82,042 on AnTuTu, in my particular case, you’ll see that the PRO 5 model is actually 2nd placed on AnTuTu, right below the Huawei Mate 8. Geekbench results were also great, the phone scored 1,527 in a single-core benchmarks, and 5,393 points in a multi-core test. Results were also admirable in a 3DMark test, which you can check out in the gallery down below.. This is a phone, first and foremost, so phone calls are kind of important. Well, you’ll be glad to know that this handset does really well in this department. The earpiece provided clear sound, and it was just loud enough when you turn the volume all the way up. The people I’ve talked to said that they can hear me really well, which led me to test the microphone myself (on the other end), and the sound was quite good, no complaints here. Same can be said for 3G and 4G connectivity, both of which I’ve tested separately. Wi-Fi also provided stable connectivity, I did not experience any significant issues here, though keep in mind that the phone has a built-in idle mode for Wi-Fi which sometimes tends to block notifications from apps which are set to go to sleep while the phone is in idle mode.. Battery life is, for me personally, one of the most important factors when it comes to smartphones, and I’m glad to say Meizu PRO 5 doesn’t disappoint in this section either. The phone will always provide at least 4 hours and 30 minutes of screen-on time during your day, presuming you’re not a heavy gamer or something similar, in that case it might go slightly below that number. I’ve been using this handset for quite a while with Flyme 4.5 on it, and over a week with the official Flyme 5 installed. The phone performed almost identical in both versions as far as battery life goes, it was capable of producing over 4:30h of screen on time.. I’m what you’d consider a heavy user, even though I don’t really play that many games, I tend to play chess and some arcade games occasionally, but nothing too graphically intensive. I did load some 3D games on the phone simply for testing purposes and did play them as mentioned in the ‘performance’ section of this review. The phone was still able to produce around 4:30h of screen on time, though if you throw some gaming into the mix, and play those games for a while, the battery life might go below that mark, which was to be expected.. In a gallery down below you’ll get to see the battery results from one regular day of use for me. There are four screenshots there because in Flyme 5 you can check out screen-on time for the last 12 hours, so I had to take more screenshots. Anyhow, I unplugged the phone at 7am in this particular example, and at 11:55pm I still had 15% battery left. The total screen on time at that point was 4:26 minutes, as you can see in these images. Overall, I was very pleased with battery life on Meizu PRO 5, as I’ve used plenty of phones with awful battery life lately, and Meizu PRO 5 is definitely not one of them.. Meizu PRO 5 ships with Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box, but this is definitely not stock Android. Now, some of you might not prefer skins on Android, which is completely understandable considering OEMs tend to put tons of bloat on it, but Flyme is actually quite good. The phone ran incredibly smooth, and the UI looks really good as well, as you can see in the images down below. You do get another layer of customizability here, while you keep some of Lollipop’s benefits. lockscreen notifications, heads-up notifications and similar features are built into Flyme as well.. Now, you do get tons of gestures in this OS, from double tap to wake and swipe up to wake & unlock, to various other gestures. You can basically write a letter on the display when the screen is off and call upon an app of your choice. Keep in mind that all of these gestures are customizable, and they work great. Now, there’s also a feature the company calls ‘SmartTouch’. SmartTouch is essentially a hovering on-screen key which can be set to perform various tasks. For example, you can swipe up on this key in order to go to your home screen, or you can swipe down to call upon the notification shade. If you tap on it, it will act as a back button, and if you swipe left or right it will multitask for you, take you to apps you’ve used before or after the app you’re using at the moment. This button can be really useful as you can place it wherever you want, and I actually use it.. One more important thing you should know about Flyme, is the fact that you don’t get an app drawer here. Apps are placed on your home screens, though you can use widgets as well and group apps into folders, of course. This is not the most fortunate solution, but the UI works great and the design is also significantly improved in Flyme 5. There are, of course, some additional additions to this software, and if you check out the images in the gallery down below you’ll get a much better idea of what I’m talking about.. The loudspeaker located on the bottom of the device is good, though it’s not as good as some front-facing speakers out there, looking at you BoomSound. That being said, the phone does offer really good audio quality, and especially after you plug in your headphones. You’ll get a balanced and crisp sound, even though every smartphone has limitations in this area. I’ve really enjoyed listening to music on the PRO 5, and after I looked at more details specs of the device, I noticed that the company really did focus on improving audio capabilities of this phone, read on.. Meizu has used the ES9018K2M and OPA1612 chips in this phone, which have been used in its predecessor, the MX4 Pro as well. Now, on top of this, Meizu has included a Solo amp circuit, and also four pairs of NXP high current transistors This might not mean much to you, but in the end, I did notice somewhat improved audio output when plugging in quality headphones in here. As I’ve already mentioned, smartphones, in general, are somewhat limited in terms of audio output, and you can’t expect the same quality sound you get out of hi-fi stereos, but compared to other handsets, Meizu PRO 5. does really well in this department.. The PRO 5 differentiates in plenty of ways compared to its competition, from software and the use of its hardware button, all the way to sound quality. Well, on top of all this, the phone also has a great camera. The PRO 5 ships with a 21.16-megapixel CMOS shooter (PDAF included), this is actually Sony’s IMX230 sensor Meizu used, which comes with f/2.2 aperture. On top of this sensor you’ll find the LARGAN 6P lens which has been adapted especially for this camera according to the company. On top of all this, Meizu has included sapphire glass over the lens in order to protect it. The phone can focus in and take a shot really fast (0.17s), and the Laser Autofocus is also available here, and surely helps with shot speed as well. The dual channel 14-bit Samsung ISP algorithm optimization has been implemented within the software, and the dual-LED, dual tone flash is available on the back of this phone as well.. Now, that’s a lot of tech talk, but is the camera any good? Well, yes, it is, really good. The lens itself allows quite a bit of light to enter the image, even though not as much as some other shooters we’ve seen out there. Now, this is not a problem whatsoever considering the fact that it doesn’t overexpose an image in low light, but it allows just enough light to enter the shot for the end result to be really, really good and well-balanced. We’ve included some low light samples in the gallery down below, and we haven’t used the LED flash in any of the images. The pictures are well balanced in daylight as well, and the phone does a really great job indoors as well, no matter whether there’s enough light or not. I was quite surprised with the end results of this camera, if I’m being completely honest, the images turned out better than I expected, which is a testament to Meizu. Keep in mind that the vast majority of sample images were shot in bad conditions on purpose in order to really test out this camera’s performance.. What is there left to say? Meizu PRO 5 is one of the best devices I have reviewed to date. The phone has lots to offer in terms of build, performance, camera and sound output. Its display is really great as well, especially for those of you who appreciate OLED panels. Keep in mind that Flyme offers a somewhat different approach to stock Android, and as long as you’re comfortable with it, chances are you’re going to like this phone. The device comes in both 3 and 4GB RAM variants, and is significantly more affordable than other similarly specced offerings out there. So, do I think this device is worth it? Yes, definitely..
