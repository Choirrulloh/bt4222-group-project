Love the specs of the new Lumia 535. By Vishalanand Kambli | 22 Nov 2014. I just Love the amazing specs of the new Lumia 535. The features being offered for around Rs. 8-9000/- are great for this price range.. The only 2 disadvantages I find are - A low res video and no zoom on the main camera, which should have been atleast 8 megapixels.. All in all, a very good buy with great specs and features if it is in the range of Rs. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 5 out of 5 people found this review helpful. By Anand Krishna | 5 Dec 2014. Lumia 535 seems to be a good phone at around 9000. 220ppi for 5inch display is not bad,when even 5.5 inch display phones uses 199ppi. 1GB RAM,LED flash camera,qualcomm quad core processor,13 hr 3g talktime(most phones at this price has only 8hr 3g talktime).Rating will be excellent + in the budget windows phone. Overall the Microsoft Lumia 535 will make a good impression in the mobile market for the windows user. Pros: * of course Price, comparatively among all other phones in the market with specifications., *Windows 8.1 OS with DENIM. cons: 480P video capturing, even Lumia 520 has 720P.... But its simply awesome in performance and surely you will get your worth back...... Was this review helpful? Yes No. 3 out of 3 people found this review helpful. By Sunil Chennupati | 14 Nov 2014. Microsoft finally gave a great surprise by revealing this beautiful device. No one expected such great specs for a low end device especially for windows device from Microsoft. Everyone expected a 0.3 megapixel vga camera at the front of it but it got a wide angle 5 mp, the same unit which present in nokia lumia 735 and 730. Even though the processor is snapdragon 200 which is pretty low end, its more than enough to handle things coupled with a gig of ram. An extra 200 mah battery could have done better but we can always expect a great battery performance from windows phone 8.1 os. The 5mp back cam with flash is a great upgrade. The only down part of this device is, it only supports 480P video capturing which is pretty disappointing. But its a great low end phone with slim profile.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 10 out of 10 people found this review helpful. By parth deshpande | 6 Oct 2015. battry life and camera quality are good.. what i dont like is there is no camera zoom function & it get hot when we process too much. Overall from microsoft this is very nice smart phone. Was this review helpful? Yes No. Good Price but lacks build quality and repair service satisfaction. By Shubham Pandey | 27 Feb 2015. Glossy new at first but many complaints of suddenly not working within 45 days and even customer service not good as the company doesn't give the phone back if given for repairing. No one tells what happened and you may end up making rounds to the customer care and the head office every week to get your phone back. pro- 1.Brand name & Operating system 2.multiple Lumia features 3.awesome camera cons- 1.plastic finish of back cover 2.software with many glitches (suddenly everything becomes bigger)/abruptly stops working 3.Unsatisfactory customer service All in all make sure you have a good customer care contacts before buying.

CNET también está disponible en español.. Microsoft's first Lumia phone tries a bit too hard to be cheap. The Good The Microsoft Lumia 535 is very cheap, it has a fun design with interchangeable cases, a 5-megapixel front camera and software features found on higher-end Lumias.. The Bad It doesn't have 4G LTE, its under-powered processor results in a sluggish interface, the touchscreen can be unresponsive and the screen is neither sharp nor particularly vivid.. The Bottom Line The Lumia 535's cheap price, big screen and colourful body earn it plenty of points, but its lack of 4G LTE, unimpressive display and sometimes sluggish interface mean this phone isn't suitable for anything more than the basics.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Now the ink is dry on Microsoft's buyout of Nokia, the Nokia name is now a thing of the past on Lumia phones. Say hello, then, to the Microsoft Lumia 535. Name aside, it's business as usual for a Lumia. It has that familiar plastic body, with rounded replaceable covers. But instead of celebrating the Microsoft takeover with an all-singing, all-dancing flagship, the Lumia 535 is an ultra-budget phone.. Its 5-inch display has a 960x540-pixel resolution, it has a 1.2GHz quad-core processor and 5-megapixel cameras on the front and back. One area that's particularly lacking is its connectivity -- the Lumia 535 does not support 4G data speeds, so you'll only be able to use 3G networks.. The Lumia 535 is widely available in the UK for around £85, and from online retailers in the US for $130, and in Australia for around AU$170. You should expect it to be offered for even less when subsidised by phone networks.. Microsoft may have slapped its own name over the phone, but the 535 doesn't stray far from the usual Lumia design scheme. It has a one-piece plastic rear shell -- available in a range of vibrant colours, of course. It's a cheery, fun design that stands out from the usual miserable grey slabs that you'll find in the bargain section (I'm looking at you, Huawei Y550 ).. It feels well put together and as the rear case is interchangeable, you can always swap it for a fresh one when it starts to look a little battered. Or simply change it for a different colour if you want it to match that day's outfit.. With a 5-inch display shoved inside, the body has to be quite large. It measures 140mm long, 72mm wide and 8.8mm thick (5.5 by 2.8 by 0.3 inches), which may be a tad cumbersome for many of you. It's certainly easier to type on using two hands, rather than using one and stretching out your thumb.. You'll find the power and volume buttons around the edges, along with the 3.5mm headphone jack and micro-USB port for charging and data transfer. Underneath the casing is where the microSD card slot and SIM tray are hiding. It supports microSD cards up to 128GB in size and I suggest you pick one up -- a 32GB one won't set you back much -- as the 8GB of built-in storage won't last long.. The Lumia 535's 5-inch screen is on the large side for a budget phone. That means there's loads of space for you to really make the most of watching YouTube clips or browsing through your photos.. It has a 960x540-pixel resolution, which isn't particularly high and does result in small text looking a little fuzzy. High-resolution photos, too, lack the crisp clarity you'll see on screens with more pixels. The Windows Phone interface is perfectly clear, however, and basic apps like email and calendar, along with commonly used apps such as Twitter, Facebook and Spotify, are all easily readable.. Colours aren't great -- they look particularly washed-out when you view them next to more vivid displays such as the one on the slightly pricier Lumia 735 -- but viewing angles are fair. It's not an amazing screen by any means, but for this little money it's more than adequate.. As a Lumia phone, it of course comes with Windows Phone 8.1 , along with the latest software update, codenamed Denim. Windows Phone 8 is easy on the eye, made up lots of large, bright tiles that show live information. You can resize these tiles and reorder them to suit your preferences, set different backgrounds and group tiles together into folders, thanks to the Denim software update.. Another recent feature is the notification panel that you pull down from the top of the screen, like in Android. It shows incoming notfications from your messaging apps or emails, as well as giving quick access to critical settings such as Wi-Fi and screen brightness.. The Denim update also includes Microsoft's new Siri-like voice assistant, Cortana. Like Siri, you can ask questions such as, "What's the weather like tomorrow?" or, "How much is £5 in dollars?" and you'll be given results in the app, or shown a list of Web results, if Cortana doesn't have the answer. It mostly works fine, although I'd say it defaults to a Web search a little too often. Being able to do a search by pressing and holding the search button and speaking your question is certainly quicker than typing out in a search in the browser.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition....

Microsoft Lumia 535 screen is a gorilla glass or not?. and I'm getting so much problem with the touch screen, when my finger is little wet because of sweat, the screen doesn't work correctly... Thank you for posting on the forum.. According to your post, you are experiencing issues with the touch screen on your Lumia 535 phone.. Our technical teams in Finland and the US have been fully aware of the evolution of this whole problem. We’ve deployed two bug fixes - early in December and now from the last week of February, with many customers seeing a significant performance improvement.. However for a reduced group of customers this problem has not been fully resolved, compared with the whole volume of sales the devices still presenting problems represent a very small percentage.. This absolutely doesn’t mean we don’t care about those customers, quite the opposite Microsoft wants 100% of its customers satisfied; we’ll be contacting each one of you privately to find out more about your very rare problem and provide guidance to your. I want to reassure you that Microsoft has taken very seriously this issue and our technical teams will continue working to deliver the solutions you need.. I have sent you a private message to which you can reply if the issue persists.. In reply to Sheena M.'s post on March 17, 2015.

Microsoft Lumia 535 – Design & Features. The Lumia 535 is Microsoft’s 5-inch follow-up to the disappointing Nokia Lumia 530. The small 4-inch screen makes way for a larger 5-inch display as Microsoft seeks to deliver what it thinks is the definitive budget smartphone. The most sought-after change, though, is the removal of the awful fixed-focus camera. This was rubbish at taking pictures and has thankfully been replaced with a camera that packs both autofocus and an LED flash. The front camera has also had a boost and is now a selfie takers dream, since it packs a decent-sized 5-megapixel sensor.. On the surface the Lumia 535 appears to be a great budget phone and with a dual-SIM version available in some regions appears to strike all the right notes. Available SIM-free for under £70 there aren’t many 5-inch smartphones that will beat it on price either. It’s disappointing to see, then, that a handful of careless mistakes cost it dearly.. Related: Mobile Phone Buyer’s Guide. The vibrant replaceable covers are available in orange, black, grey, green, white and cyan and give the Lumia 535 a more premium look than its low price would suggest. The shiny orange version that we have is our least favourite, but the matte plastic options – black, grey, white and cyan – are especially pleasing on the eye. The vibrant design does its best to distract from some of the Lumia 535’s niggling issues but it won’t fool you all the time. Parts of the removable cover don’t fit as precisely as they should do, which results in subtle but noticeable ‘creaks’ when picking the phone up. It’s a minor fit-and-finish issue that all of the extra money you will have saved will help you forget, but it’s still noticeable.. Related: Best Cheap Smartphones Round-up. More difficult to ignore is how the case and battery sometimes become dislodged when dropped. We spilled the Lumia 535 onto a thin carpet five or six times, and the case and battery continuously came out. If the handset landed on its corner, it was more or less a certainty. The screen is made from Gorilla Glass so it’s sturdier and scratch-free, but that’s of little consolation. No matter what the price, this isn’t good enough of any mainstream smartphone.. On a brighter note, Microsoft doesn’t skip corners too much elsewhere. The 8GB of built-in storage should prove ample for lighter users. If that’s not enough then there’s a microSD card slot, too. You don’t get 4G at this price, but you do get Bluetooth 4.0 and – unlike some cheaper phones – it has an ambient light sensor as well. Related: Best Windows Phone Round-up.

It’s one of the reasons it doesn’t look like a cheap phone – its size puts it in similar company to much more expensive rivals.. We couldn’t call the screen anything more than adequate, though, despite Microsoft’s use of IPS display tech. We found the viewing angle quite shallow, with a noticeable loss of detail when viewed slightly off-centre. IPS screens normally have excellent viewing angles, so it just goes to show that IPS isn’t an automatic guarantor of quality.. Related: Best Android Phones Round-up. Colours are somewhat muted and whites have a slightly blue-ish hue at lower brightness levels, but we’ve seen much worse screens on phones at this price. Some might argue the 960 x 540 resolution (220ppi) is a tad low for a 5-inch phone – and they’d have a point if the Lumia 535 cost £150, but it doesn’t.. More importantly, outdoor visibility is very good – an area cheaper phones often struggle with. Our only criticism here is that the ambient sensor often sets the screen a little dimmer than we’d like, but this is easily overridden.. Surprisingly, however, our biggest frustration with the screen was its touch-sensitivity – a problem we don’t often have to complain about anymore. We occasionally suffered missed presses when typing, which is very irritating.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

Windows phones have been looming the market since 2011 owing to Microsoft and Nokia's long term partnership. Running with Windows OS, they were marketed under the brand name of Nokia since then. However, 2014 saw the close of this deal between these two techno giants. As a result, the latter's brand name slowly faded out and Microsoft unveiled its first non-Nokia branded Smartphone – the Microsoft Lumia 535..

However, change is inevitable and Microsoft decides to upgrade its Lumia with Windows 10..

Of them some worth mentioning are its introduction of Universal Apps, Intra-device notification sync and the all new edge browser for smartphones.. Microsoft claims that this newfangled OS will project echelons of optimization that will proliferate its battery life by a commendable 2.5 hours.

It supports multi-touch and provides a resolution of 540 x 960 pixels.. What stands out here is its Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection, that makes this screen completely scratch and smudges proof.. Microsoft has done their homework when one talks of the camera of Lumia 535. With a fixed focal lens of 28mm, it stands at an aperture of f/2.4. A ¼ crop sensor houses this lens that projects capabilities of up to 5 megapixels.. Owing to its shallow depth of field, this camera is perfect for clicking bokehs and portraits. It also privileges you to try your hand at a couple of macro shots rendering some impeccable details. It allows shooting 480p videos @30fps and provides option for geo-tagging.. However, one should not forget the front camera of 5 megapixels that is ideal for video calling, vlogging or snapping away some casual selfies.. Microsoft Lumia 535 will include Bluetooth 4.0 coupled with LE and A2DP connectivity. It also opts for Wi-Fi channeling at 802.11 b/g/n with hotspot connectivity of up to 4 devices. Other notable features include A-GPS with GLONASS, micro USB 2.0 and FM radio..

Music play of up to 78 h is achievable while normal stand by time figures at 552h..

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Face detection, Geo tagging. 848 x 480 pixels 30 fps. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 11.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 23.0 days (552 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 13.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern..

Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. A decent budget smartphone with a big screen. While this may be a Microsoft branded device, the Nokia Lumia legacy influence is still here. It may be built for a budget consumer, but with a 5-inch display and 5MP selfie shooter, there's still a lot to like here.. If you've handled one of Nokia's vast array of Windows phones in the past few years twirling the Microsoft Lumia 535 round in your hands will feel instantly familiar.. It's a plastic shell, with rounded corners and an anonymous black front. Slippy but able to take a few knocks, this screamingly orange device is yet another in a succession of absolutely unsubtle Lumia devices – and it's goshdarned cheap too at around £75 (roughly US$120, AU$160).. But this isn't a Nokia phone. Well, for all intents and purposes it is, but no mention of the Finnish brand can be found anywhere on this bargain priced smartphone. Where the old familiar logo was, the Microsoft branding now sits proudly above the 5-inch display.. This is one of the first phones to come with the Microsoft Lumia branding, after the software giant completed its buyout of the phone maker earlier this year. While the Nokia name will live on with other products, notably the iPad mini-esque N1 tablet, Microsoft has started to completely remove it from all its phones.. Though, nothing much has really changed. With Android and iOS dominating the high-end of the market, Windows Phone 8.1 devices tend to offer decent specs in an affordable package and the Microsoft Lumia 535 is no different. For your low outlay you will get a 5-inch display with a resolution of 960 x 540, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 processor, 8GB of internal memory and 1GB of RAM.. For the budget cost, those specs are definitely nothing to complain about.. In the past few months we've seen some impressive budget conscious smartphones, including the Android toting Moto G (2014) and fellow Windows Phone 8.1 devices like the Nokia Lumia 635 and 530 – so does the Microsoft logo mean that Windows Phone can now neatly compete in the low-end smartphone war?. Microsoft might have slapped its logo on the front and back of the phone, but this is unmistakably a Nokia Lumia.. The rear plastic shell pops off, revealing a removable 1,905 mAh battery and a space for a SIM card. Some regions will get the dual-SIM variant, but the UK at least will get the single SIM handset. There's also a microSD slot here, a necessary inclusion as the 8GB of internal storage will soon run dry when you start packing in apps.. The shell itself feels sturdy, but if you start to bend it the volume rocker does pop out of the shell, so… maybe don't play about with it too much or put it in your back pocket.. But even if you were to break or drop it, you could just swap the shell out for another one. Same goes if your eyes start to tire of the bright orange hue.. Almost as soon as I started using the Lumia 535 I knew it was going to be an absolute fingerprint magnet, and it soon proved to be a correct assumption.. The plastic picks up smudges all over, oily residue sticks to it and after about an hour of use I had to wipe it clean. An hour later, another wipe down. Corning's Gorilla Glass 3, which protects the screen, is also prone to picking up grime – so be ready, this is a high maintenance device.. Aside from the volume rocker and standby switch, both of which are suitable clicky and responsive, the phone is free from other buttons. This is down to Windows Phone 8.1 following Android's lead and allowing the use of on-screen controls.. A 3.5mm headphone jack sits on the top, while the ubiquitous microUSB charging takes its place on the bottom.. For a £75 (US$120, AU$160) device, the Lumia ticks all the boxes in terms of design.. No, it doesn't possess a premium finish like the iPhone 6 or HTC One M9 , but it also doesn't feel like a Fisher Price 'My First Smartphone'. It's fun, durable and well built and I've dropped it a few times with no damage, which is always a plus, especially when you're a clumsy tech journalist trying to avoid the wrath of angry PRs..

This is the first complete Microsoft device launched recently. It is the latest, the cheapest and the best. The hardware and the software is all by Microsoft, so expect premium quality hardware and experience the superior software Windows Phone 8.1 Design and Display- It has got that same lovely polycarbonate body with a glossy finish as seen on Lumia 535. It feels really great to hold as the grip on the glossy part is good. The "Microsoft Mobile" embossed at the back gives it a decent brand value. It has got the dual sim capability. It is pretty thin but a little heavy as it weighs 146 gm. However, the 5 inch display fits perfect in hand. It is made for those who love a bigger screen and want to do more. The qHD 960x540 pixels on an IPS LCD screen provide good viewing angles and better resolution at this price point. It boasts a Scratch Resistant Glass(Corning Gorilla Glass 3). Various features like Brightness Control, High Brightness Mode and the trademark Sunlight Readability have been put in to make the experience more brighter, crisper and clear.Performance- The 1.2 Ghz Snapdragon 200 quad core clubbed with 1GB RAM is a boomerang. It is very much able to give an ultra smooth performance without any stutters or lags. These were the ideal specifications people were dying for. Now it has got all you want at only 9k. Most of the games like Asphalt 8 play smooth. Multitasking was never so simple and beautiful as on this device. The various enhancements and changes in the software have facilitated a good experience overall. The only things to worry about are- i) When you are playing music, you would see minute stutters while you go back to the main screen by pressing the back or the home button. The tiles stutter a bit but that's okay. ii) If you fill up the main screen with hell lot of things the same thing will happen again as mentioned above. iii) Some apps and games may take a bit extra time to open sometimes but they will run smooth. For example, the Xbox Games takes too long sometimes. However, the rest is all fine except for negligible issues like minute lags or stutters. But for day-to-day activities, it's surely not a disappointment.Software- It comes preloaded with the new Windows 8.1 Update 1 Lumia Denim which brings with it a lot of camera stability improvements and much more. Windows 8.1 was a huge update. It changed the environment and optimized apps to run on a low end hardware. However, 1GB RAM in windows is like a 2GB in Android. With the Word Flow, Action Centre, Windows is now at par with IOS and Android. Only certain things need improvement like the IE, Play Store apps, etc but they will be soon at par as the Windows 10 arrives. Play Store has less apps but quality and required apps. So never say that the useful apps are not there. Still, the Play Store lacks in Google applications which are much needed. It has Office pre installed which is nice. Windows is not a resource hungry environment like Android and hence your phones will last longer unlike Android Phones which last for a year max. Camera- It has got a 5MP primary and a secondary camera which is a good news for selfie lovers. The various camera applications like Lumia Camera, Lumia Panorama, Video Tuner, Blink, etc make your phone a DSLR. It captures amazing photographs in the low light, thanks to the LED Flash. It has got a few bugs, very small ones which would be fixed for sure. Battery-The battery back up is really good now. It comes with 1905 maH battery which would last for a day surely.

Trust me this is more than enough for a phone running a WP8.1. battery life is similar to an Android phone having a 2200mAh battery. T hese three major features (Missing in 52X series) are added. Additionally, this phone comes with a Denim update. Gorilla glass 3 is great! Scratch resistant. At this price you can compare with any other lower priced smartphone. What fluidity man! The OS is really smooth and doesn't lag while running heavy applications. This is going to be a killer. If you can afford more, get a Lumia 730. Reviewed on MySmartPrice. Report spam 0 0. Another good budget phone from Lumia.(*With some drawbacks). Microsoft's first phone in lumia series comes forward in a low budget for the new smartphone users choosing the windows operating system. Following are the aspects to be considered apart from the specifications. ->Display & Touch:The phone comes in handy and looks expensive with the 5 inch wider display. The options like orientation sensor, sunlight readability enhancements and High brightness mode provide the phone with better optimized graphics and true color display. The screen touch feels good and the screen is made of scratch resistant corning gorilla glass.(Better one for a low budget phone) ->Os:The windows operating system though provides more sync and accessibility, is difficult to operate for the beginners and also requires more knowledge of the OS features for daily use. ->Camera:The flash is an additional feature to the 5 MP primary camera and the secondary selfie cam is also a 5 MP cam(without flash) which is a good feature to consider in this price range.The disadvantage I have noticed is that the camera though has good focus and wider angle but has got no zooming option. ->Memory and Processor:The internal storage is 8GB and almost 2 to 3 GB is used for the OS & inbuilt apps and the remaining can be useful for installing for more number of apps and for better usage the storage can be expandable up-to 128 GB. The Snapdragon 200 quad core processor runs good at a clock speed of 1.2 GHz which is good for any possible type of app. ->Battery: The battery capacity is about 1950mAh which is not so good for the perfect usage of the given and installable apps and the max talk time is about 13 hrs which is not long lasting. =>Final Word:Before deciding to buy this phone, you need to note that the battery is no good for the avid travelling users as it may require more recharge cycles for continuous usage and may not last for more than 1 day with continuous data usage.Though the gaming and app usage experience is good, it may get hanged at times and as the on screen buttons will be helpless at that time and you may find it a hindrance.So, buyers better compare and check your requirements before buying.

Introduction The first Microsoft -branded Lumia – the Lumia 535 , announced a couple of months ago, is a low-end handset , targeted at the budget-oriented folk who still look for a device that offers the connectivity options of a modern smartphone, but having corners cut in all the right places, in order to make for a viable compromise. Costing $169.99 in the US, the Lumia 535 brings all the bells and whistles of Windows Phone 8.1 – Cortana included – powered by the humble Snapdragon 200, but still paired with a good 1 GB of RAM. So, does this handset really deliver usability, or is it just another entry-level device that frustrates users, rather than empower them? Let's check it out! In the box: User manual Wall charger Headset Design No-nonsense As we said, corners had to be cut, and this is evident once one lays their eyes on the Lumia 535 for the very first time – the handset looks rather dull – a black front with a quite darkened Microsoft logo above the display and a frontal cam nested right next to it – if you try to pick up the handset in a low-light environment, you'd be hard-pressed to tell which way is up. The back panel of the device wraps around its sides and can come in a few vivid colors, signature for the Lumias, though – our review unit is matte black, which just adds to the device's dry looks. Its plastic does not feel as cheap to the touch as one would expect, but does tend to attract a lot of fingerprint smudges. We also winced at the protruding camera – a gradual lump at the back of the 0.35" (8.8 mm) thick handset houses a 5 MP snapper, with its LED flash situated to the left of it. As far as buttons go – we found them to be pleasant to the touch – both the power button and volume rockers are placed on the right side, clicky when pressed, and just a very tiny bit shallower than we would like. Size-wise – the handset sports a 5" display, but does not feel bulky to handle. In terms of contemporary handset size – the Lumia 535 falls in the "normal" category – it keeps the user mindful of which pocket they tuck it in, yet is not larger-than-comfortable. Display The entry-level 535 looks to deliver an industry-standard experience in terms of display size – its 5" screen delivers a more comfortable usage experience than the 4" one that adorned the Lumia 530. Its pixel density, however, is, as can be expected, on the low side – a 540 x 960 resolution makes for a 220 PPI ratio, which often means that the user will need to zoom in to read text on webpages. We were pleasantly surprised by its color temperature – measuring at 7069 K – just slightly higher than the reference value of 6,500 K – the display does not look too cold and its color reproduction is pleasant and rather accurate. The viewing angles are, as can be expected, pretty harsh – though, not as bad as we've seen on other low-range handsets. Watching the display straight on will provide for an even image, both in portrait and landscape mode, however, slightly tilting it will lead to distortions. As far as brightness goes – the lowest the display can go is 61 nits, which doesn't make for pleasant usage in the dark. The highest level it can go to is 433 nits, which, combined with a strongly reflective glass on the panel, doesn't make it easily readable under the sun as well.. 5.52 x 2.85 x 0.35 inches. 140.2 x 72.4 x 8.8 mm. 5.57 x 2.78 x 0.43 inches. 141.5 x 70.7 x 11 mm. 5.3 x 2.7 x 0.34 inches. 134.7 x 68.5 x 8.7 mm. 5.51 x 2.75 x 0.39 inches. 139.9 x 69.8 x 9.99 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The numbers below represent the amount of deviation in the respective property, observed when a display is viewed from a 45-degree angle as opposed to direct viewing.. Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Microsoft Lumia 535 Compare.

This lumia 535 has a 5mp camera, single rear speaker, 960x540 display.

Fix Kits starting at $16.99. I have a Microsoft Lumia 535 (purchased June 2015) and the battery performance is terrible.. When I first got it, the battery that came with it would take three hours to charge to 100% but would only last nine hours, even if I just left the phone on the coffee table and did not use it. I have the data connection switched off, the battery saver on and settings such as screen brightness reduced.. I have found that when I get the "battery critically low" warning, I can switch the phone off with it reporting battery level 5%, go home and switch it back on to plug in the charger and it reports battery level 19% or 20% - clearly it can be recharged by static electricity!. I bought a new battery - looks like the original except not embossed with 'Microsoft' and clearly just a generic Chinese replica. The new battery took seven hours to charge from scratch and failed to last four hours.. I could not recommend this product to anybody. I used to have a Nokia 2G phone that would go fully charged for a week but it seems since it became Microsoft it is all Chinese mass-production and no Finnish technology.. I have the same problem, my phone will not charge. My phone playing out..i cant even charge. Sanjana Chakraborty, try a different charger and charging cord. If that does not resolve the issue, you can try a new battery. If still unresolved, have the phone repaired under warranty since it is only 4 months old. My phone was sent as an upgrade, I have tried a different charger, also rebooted the phone.. Please try recnating motpbl tames if tatht did not work try caccing the USB If it is not hint you may not have it the rat way if it is bint use a duvit chr If you do niy have one buy one never hoedlele take out the USB it may bintd or eplxp this is how you do it.. Why my phone can not be filled. Why my phone can not be filled. Connet charging pin into phone and hold phone in your hand for a while, as soon as the phone vibrates just long press the power button until you see the Microsoft logo appear on screen. Put the phone down and it will just show the low battrey cell on screen. Leave the phone and it will automatically switch- on on its own once it has powered up about 2%. It happens all the time with my phone but the above technique always works or fixes it but i think its a manufacture glitch if you ask me.. They problem can not b fix. I dunno :| I had It too.
