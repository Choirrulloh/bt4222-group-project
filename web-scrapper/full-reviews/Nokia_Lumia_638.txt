Firstly kudos to Amazon for delivering on time Coming to the phone- its excellent. The battery on the 638 lasts almost as long as my old Lenovo P770 which came with a mammoth 3500 Mah battery. The voice quality is the best I have ever seen. The touch is responsive although I wish there was a setting like on MS windows Mouse Controls which would make the scrolling become more faster. The 1 GB Ram ensures that the phone works flawlessly even when multitasking. It doesn't hang (hardly once and that was just the Gmail app), the rest of the phone was responding. I have already dropped the phone 3-4 times and the screen looks like it can take a lot more abuse. For 7,000 bucks I think this is the best phone out there if you don't want a zillion apps on your phone. Even in my android, I just had a few apps- gmail, facebook, whatsapp, naukri.com and a few others- all of which are available on Windows. The best thing I like is I don't have to download any apps to clear RAM, boost memory, boost speed, clear up cache and God knows what else. Reminds me of my good old Symbian Nokia E5. Not having flash is a little bit of an issue; I use it to go to the washroom at night or in a movie hall to walk down the stairs- but apart from that one aspect- I did not find it lacking for anything. Excellent Phone!!! An absolutely pleasure to use!!!. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars SuperFast Affordable 4G Lumia.. Meet my needs, No lags superfast Affordable 4G Phone.. First of all am a lumia boy.. I just low Lumia and its User Interface compared to Android. Coming to Lumia 638 its just a masterpiece in middle end devices. 1gb ram with Snapdragon 400 makes it superfast.. Sound clarity is good, but not that much of 630.. The only negative we can say is that there is no flash for the rear camera and there is no front cam. Otherwise this will be super affordable most fav phone for many. Regarding delivery, what to say - it was just excellent.. Ordered around 6pm in the evening, got it delivered on next day morning around 9am.. Delivered in less than 15 hours - In Normal FREE Delivery Option. Coming to software section Microsoft India has not given Lumia Denim to 638 and says that it will be directly updated to Windows 10. The current software in 638 is Cyan Release (WP8.1) If any body needs Denim Release (WP8.1 Update 1) just follow these steps.. There's an easy way to get it through Preview For Developers (PFD) Update.. Go to this Page nd Register for free app studio account - http://appstudio.windows.com/en-us (the email used to register should be same as of the Microsoft account email in your device) After completing the Registration Download an app to the mobile from store - Preview For Developers APP https://www.windowsphone.com/en-IN/store/app/preview-for-developers/178ac8a1-6519-4a0b-960c-038393741e96?signin=true Then go to the app and again sign in with the same MS account.. Now Settings -> Phone Update -> Check For Updates You will get an update and you will be updated to Build 14147 After updating again Check for Updates.. Nd your Phone will be update to Build 14219 i.e., Lumia Denim (WP8.1 Update 1) (OS Version: 8.10.14219.341) Cortana is now enabled in your 638. This way you can get Denim in 638. OR if you dont need new features and are satisfied with Cyan you can wait till Windows 10 gets released. Lumia 638 IN CV will directly get updated to 10 without Denim.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Work Horse: slick black robust its last of Nokia line. I was a Lumia 520 user and using windows phones since 2008. I cant use a android due to eco system issues so comparision on OS is meaninigless for me. For office requirements it s excellent product the 1 GB RAM has made huge difference in response. Looks are neat and elegant and well finished product.Camera is basic but effective in scannning your documents using Office Lens. Nokia Mix Radio, BT4 connectivity, form factor facilitating carriage during jogging/training and robust built for which I trust Nokia and hopefully Microsoft after take over: Are my major reasons I chose it over bigger, greater CPU, twin SIM, front higher pixel cam phones. If you are a windows user dont think twice. For the Windows Vs android debate its endless. I love tiles, i have all the apps i could possibly need. I dont need it for gaming. You can shut off all background battery hogging tasks in windows unlike android. Its an extension of your windows desktop. Offline Here Maps are much better than google maps. Update: After 8 months of use still going strong. But there is no Denim update and Windows 10 not in sight. With option now available this is a dead phone in the market..

I bought this phone on "The Great Indian Sale" by Amazon on 2015. I have been using this phone for about 2 years and I am wholeheartedly saying that this is the best phone. I bought this phone for about Rs. I downloaded Asphalt 8 on 2015 and till now I'm playing this game without any flaws. I would thank Windows for the flawless gaming experience.. Reviewed on MySmartPrice. Report spam 0 0. I've been using this mobile for the past 3 months as my daily driver and I love this phone. The 4.5 inch screen is super gorgeous with great viewing angles and the mobile is also very comfortable to hold. There aren't much sensors in this mobile but how many really use them? Proximity and ambient sensors are missing. I am not sure whether corning gorilla glass 3 is present or n ot as it's not mentioned on microsoft website. Battery backup is the best thing. I get backup for 1 1/2 days on medium to heavy usage. When looping on a video playback it runs for like 10 hours before battery is dead completely Coming to windows phone 8.1 OS it's very fluid, no lagging no crashing but app store is minimal With new api introduced with windows 10 and the easy possibility of porting android apps to windows, we see a lot of future for windows phones especially in budget segment Keep an eye on amazon.in I bought this mobile on Jan 26 for Rs.4999 Today is 6th may, it's available for Rs.4799 with 15% cashback for SBI, this offer might show up again. For 4000 BUCKS THIS IS SUPER (read more). Reviewed on MySmartPrice. Report spam 0 0. The best Lumia phone available in the market. Design and Display-It is the usual polycarbonate phone, very much similar in design to the Lumia 630. With a 4.5 inch IPS LCD screen, it gives 854 x 480 pixel resolution resulting in 245 ppi. The Gorilla Glass 3 protects the super sensitive screen well. The viewing angles are good and the d isplay is very fine and crisp. Performance and RAM- This phone boasts the 1.2 Ghz Snapdragon 400 quad core processor clubbed with 1GB RAM. These are the ideal specs for a Windows 8.1 device. The performance is comparable to Lumia 830 as they both have same specs. With the latest and the greatest software Windows 8.1 Update 1 Lumia Denim, the device runs smooth and good. You get all the latest features like the Action Centre, Word Flow and better optimization. Camera- It has a poor 5 MP primary and a 1.2 MP secondary camera. You would not be glad to click pictures in low light as pictures are not crisp and clear as expected from Lumia Camera. However, you still get various lenses along like Lumia Panorama and much more. Storage- It has a 8GB storage but its expandable to 128GB, so you never run out of space. Battery- It sports a 1830 maH battery which would last a day for sure. Hence, overall it works pretty well. So, I would give it a rating of 4.5 stars as it is price at an affordable 8k. Reviewed on MySmartPrice. Report spam 1 2. Nokia mobile price list in India. Moto E4 Plus price in India (Rs.

Lumia Denim update has been released in China for 638 a few months before.. I have the same question (16). Finally I found a solution for our problem i.e to install Lumia Denim update in Nokia Lumia 638.. Before performing this make sure all your data is backed up. Although this update will not cause any loss of data we cannot rule out the possibilities otherwise. Phone updates - When checking for updates it disaplays that "We are currently unable to check for updates. However this problem was resolved after hard resetting my device.. Try this update at your own risk !!!. The steps to install Lumia Denim Update in Nokia Lumia 638 are :. First of all you need to register for app studio.

Downloading can take longer depending upon your internet connection. I strongly recommend to update your device. Upon downloading the update you will be prompted to install the update. Your device will now reboot and will start to install the update.. After installing the update your phone will be rebooted and the data miigration process will start. It may take some time for the data to migrate.. After successful completion of all these processes, your device will boot up. After booting do not rush to extras+info to check your version. Keep your device aside for a few minutes so that all the apps are installed.After the succeessful. installation of all the apps reboot your device.. After rebooting go to the app "Preview for deveopers" and uncheck the box Enable Preview for developers. Now head straight to Extras+Info and you. will be greeted with message that the device is installed with Lumia Denim.This step is compulsory. because of a glitch in Extras+Info app. If you do not uncheck this box you will see that your device is installed with Cyan..

The update for phone is only Available in China, But here in India it is currently having the Lumia Cyan... It would be kind of you, if you tell me when will it be updated.. In reply to febsameer's post on March 7, 2015. ---------------------------------------------------------------- "Remember that a lone amateur built the Ark. A large group of professionals built the Titanic.". The Nokia 638 is an exclusive model for China, so if the update is shown as available for China you should get it very soon.. It makes absolutely no difference what is your actual physical location as long as the firmware is released for the handset. only need a solid wifi connection.. In reply to tiny_chef's post on March 6, 2015. I checked for the update, but it is not showing any update after Cyan. The latest update it is showing is Cyan but not Denim. link you shared is also not showing denim update for India, but only for China.. In reply to jyotikhajanchi's post on March 8, 2015. ---------------------------------------------------------------- "Remember that a lone amateur built the Ark. A large group of professionals built the Titanic.". Instead of waiting for a reply you could try reading what has already been posted in the thread, as it contains the reply.. The 638 is specifically made and intended for sale ONLY in China and is NOT for sale in India. Therefore, that page will NEVER show availability of any updates for India because the 638 officially does NOT EXIST in India.. If you still do noit receive the update OTA you can try using the. Software Recovery Tool on a PC. This will wipe your phone clean and make a complete fresh install, so back up before you proceed.. In reply to 93tid's post on March 8, 2015.

CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM..

Nokia Lumia 638: LTE Support, Now Turns Affordable. Who would have thought that a big brand would shell out Smartphones supporting LTE connectivity and that also at an affordable tick! Microsoft looks to achieve the same finally with the latest Nokia Lumia 638 which brings back the older prefix atleast for the time being. This gadget is all set for the preorders rather soon and one might expect the company to dish out the best possible band support pertaining to the gadget. This gadget made its debut in China a few months ago and now is quite ready for the Indian launch. The features aren’t tweaked or tampered with as the company keeps the brand name intact while adding a few options for supporting the Indian 4G bands.. Pros: The screen size is decently chosen and offers a compact layout for the users to bank upon. The protective sheath is one of the better aspects to have been included with this gadget which offers a high-end processor at the core. Micro-SD support is well laid out whereas the 4G connectivity makes it quite a popular bet.. Cons: We were quite disappointed with the resolution on offer which translates into a lower level of pixel density. The battery support isn’t the most inspiring feature associated with the gadget whereas the build quality seems to be pretty usual.. Here is an overview which gives a clear picture of the Nokia Lumia 638 doing international rounds. The domestic market might soon be benefitted from this innovative handset which pitches in quite a lot for the given price range.. We are looking at the usual Nokia layout with this modern gadget. Be it the durable polycarbonate framework or the colorful rear panel, the Nokia Lumia 638 is more of a usual visitor with nothing new to provide in terms of design cues. The panels can be a bit slippery at times owing to the glossy layout whereas the availability of multiple colored variants is something which goes down well with the audience. The color possibilities include matte black, yellow, orange and even white which is kind of a refreshing change besides the aesthetic appeal incorporated within.. The screen size offered involves the 4.5 inch layout which feels pretty compact for the given price range. The included layout is backed up by the FWVGA display panel offering a paltry resolution of 480x854pixels to be precise. We might be looking at multiple color combinations associated with this gadget whereas the multi-touch facilities look pretty prudent when added with the same. The interface however looks acceptable enough with the meager pixel density count of 221ppi whereas the Gorilla Glass 3 protection adorns the front panel rather perfectly in addition to the ClearBlack LCD technology to rely upon.. The latest Windows Phone 8.1 is supported as the operating platform which offers quite a lot in terms of flexibility and even aesthetic appeal. This works pretty well with the display panel on offer whereas the Lumia Denim update seems to be the most fitting ally added to the same. Both these options in unison work out the perfect visual experience with an extensive app drawer and the trendy navigation bar to look at.. The Nokia Lumia 638 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 chipset offering the quad-core processor. This brings in a lot of innovation to the table as the included cores clock at a sizeable 1.2GHz. This allocation would easily handle the basic multitasking needs while offering low-end gaming support as well.. In comes the expected segment which offers an 8GB internal storage limit. This isn’t a great inclusion whereas the expandable limit of 128GB certainly works out pretty well for the customers on a budget. The RAM support isn’t the most inspiring aspect but the 1GB limit works pretty well with the included processor and the chipset alike.. The Nokia Lumia 638 is all set to offer an extensive camera module supporting 5MP at the rear. The autofocus spec is included but the unavailability of the front snapper isn’t the most encouraging aspect.. The battery support is pretty average with the module rated at 1830mAh. This might not pull of brilliant performances with the multiple connectivity features including 4G into the mix but is certainly a great deal for the given budget.. The Nokia Lumia 638 from Microsoft is yet another budget attempt on the part of the company which involves a pretty usable camera module to rely upon. While the processor looks quite good, the dimensions aren’t exactly high-end and the lack of front camera might be a tad impairing for the professionals with video calling demands..

From left to right, the Lumia 1320 , the Lumia 535 , and the Lumia 530 .. Microsoft Lumia (previously the Nokia Lumia Series ) is a former line of mobile devices that was originally designed and marketed by Nokia and later by Microsoft Mobile. Introduced in November 2011, the line was the result of a long-term partnership between Nokia and Microsoft —as such, Lumia smartphones run on Microsoft software, the Windows Phone operating system; and later the newer Windows 10 Mobile. The Lumia name is derived from the partitive plural form of the Finnish word lumi , meaning "snow". On 3 September 2013, Microsoft announced its purchase of Nokia's mobile device business, with the deal closing on 25 April 2014. As a result, the Lumia line's maintenance was transferred to Microsoft Mobile. As part of the transition, Microsoft continued to use the Nokia brand on Lumia devices until October 2014, when it began to officially phase out the Nokia name in its promotion and production of smartphones in favor of Microsoft branding. [3] In November 2014, Microsoft announced the first Microsoft (non-Nokia) branded Lumia device, the Lumia 535. [4] In October 2015, Microsoft announced the first Lumia devices running on Windows 10 Mobile , the Lumia 950 , Lumia 950 XL and Lumia 550. [5] [6] [7] The most recent Lumia smartphone, the Lumia 650 , was announced by Microsoft on 15 February 2016. Sales decreased sharply after the introduction of Windows 10 in 2015 and Microsoft briefly stopped selling Lumia devices from the Microsoft Store at the end of 2016 [9] —by which time sales were estimated to have dropped below one million units [10] —although availability was restored at the beginning of 2017. [11] [12] In October 2017, Microsoft's corporate vice president, Joe Belfiore , confirmed that Microsoft will no longer sell or manufacture new Windows 10 Mobile devices. The existing devices will receive bug fixes and security updates only. 1.1 Partnership between Microsoft and Nokia. 1.2 Acquisition of Nokia's mobile phone business. 1.3 Under Microsoft ownership. 3 List of Lumia devices. 3.2 Nokia-branded Lumia devices. 3.3 Microsoft-branded Lumia devices. 4 Comparison of Lumia smartphones. From 1998 to 2012, Nokia was the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world, which included early smartphones built on its Symbian platform. However, in recent years, its market share declined as a result of the growing use of touchscreen smartphones from other vendors, such as Apple 's iPhone line and Android -based products. In 2010, its market share had declined to 28%, and in April 2012, Samsung Electronics (a prominent user of Android) ultimately overtook Nokia as the largest mobile phone vendor in the world. Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop vetoed the idea of producing Android devices, believing the company wouldn't be able to suitably differentiate its Android products from that of other vendors. [14] [15] In an employee memo, Elop infamously described the company as being on a "burning platform", blaming the "war of ecosystems " between iOS and Android as part of Nokia's overall struggle, and asserting that the company needed to make major changes to its operation. See also: Windows Phone §. The Nokia Lumia logo, used prior to the post-acquisition rebranding by Microsoft. Nokia Lumia 800 , the first Lumia device. In February 2011, Stephen Elop and Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer jointly announced a major business partnership between Nokia and Microsoft, which would see Nokia adopt Windows Phone as its primary platform on future smartphones, replacing both Symbian and MeeGo. The deal also included the integration of Bing as the search engine on Nokia devices, and the integration of Nokia Maps into Microsoft's own mapping services. [16] Nokia had planned to use the MeeGo platform as part of its future plans prior to the announcement, although the company announced that it would still release one MeeGo device in 2011. [16] [18] [19] Aligning with Microsoft had been considered a possibility by analysts due to Elop's prior employment with the company. Nokia unveiled its first Windows Phone 7 -based devices, the mid-range Lumia 710 and high-end Lumia 800 , on 26 October 2011 at its Nokia World conference. [21] [22] Motivated by requests from the U.S. carrier AT&T for an LTE -enabled device, Nokia quickly developed the Lumia 900 as a follow-up, first unveiled at the 2012 International CES. The Lumia 900 received heavy promotion by the carrier as a flagship device , but its launch was dampened by a software bug that prevented the device from connecting to certain mobile data networks, forcing AT&T to issue credits to those who purchased the device. Upon its launch in April 2012, the Lumia 900 was listed as a top seller on Amazon.com , but online sales began to taper off by May. While not revealing further details, a Nokia representative stated that the company was "pleased with the consumer reaction, as well as the support we have received from AT&T", while AT&T's mobility chief Ralph de la Vega stated that the Lumia 900 had "exceeded expectations". In early 2012, Nokia released the Lumia 610 , a new entry-level device taking advantage of the lower system requirements introduced by Windows Phone 7's "Tango" update. These new low-end devices were intended to improve Windows Phone adoption in emerging markets such as China. [24] [25] [26] Later in September 2012, Nokia unveiled the Lumia 820 and the Lumia 920 , its first two devices to use the second generation of the Windows Phone platform, Windows Phone 8. [27] Both featured NFC , with the Lumia 820 embedding a microSD card slot, and an optional Wireless Charging Shell for Qi wireless charging. The Lumia 920 also notably featured Qi wireless charging, and a " PureView " camera with optical image stabilization. While Nokia received criticism when it was revealed that a demonstration video of its image stabilization technology was, in fact, filmed using a professional camera, the Lumia 920 was a commercial success for the company. At MWC 2013, Nokia introduced two more Windows Phone 8 devices: the mid-range Nokia Lumia 720 and the budget Nokia Lumia 520 , the latter of which has become the highest selling Windows phone device ever. [29] In 2013, Nokia also introduced the Lumia 925 , a revised version of the 920 with a slimmer build incorporating aluminium, [30] and the Lumia 1020 , which features a 41-megapixel camera based on technology from its Symbian-based 808 PureView. [31] On 22 October 2013, Nokia extended the Lumia brand into the tablet market with the unveiling of the Lumia 2520 ; running Microsoft's Windows RT operating system, it was the company's first tablet since the Nokia Internet tablet range. [32] Some critics believed that the usage of Windows RT rather than full Microsoft Windows 8.1 led to bad sales, as most major Windows tablet makers have used Windows 8.1 in favour of Windows RT. [33] [34] Alternatively, others have claimed that the device's failure was due to its heavy weight and high price. [35] [36] Lumia 2520 was discontinued in early 2015. Although sales of the Lumia line had exceeded those of BlackBerry in the same period, Nokia still made an operating loss of €115m, with revenues falling 24% to €5.7bn following the second quarter of 2013. Over the past nine quarters [ when? ] , Nokia sustained €4.1. See also: Microsoft Mobile §. 2013 to 2014: Acquisition of Nokia's mobile phone business. On 3 September 2013, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Nokia's mobile phone business (including rights to the Lumia and low-end Asha brands) in an overall deal of over US $7bn. Stephen Elop stepped down as Nokia's CEO and returned to Microsoft as its head of devices as part of the deal, which closed in early 2014. [41] While Microsoft will license the Nokia name under a 10-year agreement, the company will only be able to use it on feature phones : those running the Series 30 , Series 30+ [42] and the Series 40 mobile operating systems based on Java ME and MediaTek technology, [43] respectively. [44] [45] These changes resulted in future Lumia models being first-party hardware produced by Microsoft. See also: Nokia X family and Nokia X platform. On 13 September 2013, the New York Times writer Nick Wingfield revealed that Nokia had been testing the Android operating system on its Lumia hardware. [48] It was one of two known Android projects at the company; the other was running the OS on low–end Asha hardware, which resulted in the Nokia X family of devices. Despite the testing, the Android-based Lumia handsets were never released and only altered Asha devices were brought to the market. In July 2014, Microsoft announced that it would discontinue the majority of its Nokia-branded devices, including the Asha, S30, S40, and X platforms, in favor of low-cost Lumia devices inheriting their design. [52] This left S30+ as Microsoft's only remaining Nokia-branded phone platform until it was sold to HMD Global in May 2016, [53] who, the following February, would announce the first Nokia-branded true Android phone, the Nokia 6 , in January 2017. Microsoft Lumia 535 , the first Microsoft branded Lumia device. Even after the acquisition of Nokia's mobile device business by Microsoft, several Lumia devices were unveiled by Microsoft Mobile in September 2014 that still carried the Nokia name, including the Lumia 830 and Lumia 735. [55] In July 2014, it had been reported by evleaks that Microsoft was attempting to license the Nokia name in a co-branding scheme, which would have possibly seen future devices branded as "Nokia by Microsoft". [56] [57] [58] As a part of the change of ownership, the social network pages have also been rebranded as Microsoft Lumia [59] [60] rather than Microsoft Mobile; this sought to emphasize the Windows Phone over other Nokia mobile phones while also updating social network pages of Windows Phone to the new Microsoft Lumia branding. [61] To reflect this change, Nokia Conversations was also rebranded as Lumia Conversations , [62] and NokNok.tv to Lumia Conversations UK. [63] However, the rebranding has not been consistent, as the Nokia Army was renamed the Spartan Nation and the support site for legacy phones, accessories, various Nokia-branded devices, and services, originally Nokia Discussions, was renamed the Microsoft Mobile Community. [64] The Lumia Beamer was the last Lumia-branded application to have its URL changed from Nokia to Lumia, signifying the end of the transitional term during which Microsoft was allowed to use Nokia.com and related sites. However, in October 2014, Microsoft officially announced that it would phase out the Nokia brand in its promotion and production of Lumia smartphones, and that future Lumia models would be branded solely with the name and logo of Microsoft. [3] [66] [67] [68] In November 2014, Microsoft announced its first self-branded phone, Microsoft Lumia 535. [4] [69] [70] Rebranding the Lumia line did not affect sales, though some critics believed that it might negatively influence consumers' decisions due to Nokia's established reputation for durability compared to the relative infancy of Microsoft's brand in the consumer phone space. [71] [72] The Nokia Lumia 638 was the last Lumia product to bear the Nokia brand, and was only released in India in December 2014.. In November 2014, a post by a Microsoft Twitter account stated that all Nokia and Microsoft Lumia smartphones running Windows Phone 8 and 8.1 would receive updates to Windows 10 ; however, following the official unveiling, Microsoft denied this, stating that they instead were targeting the "majority" of Lumia phones and that not all phones would receive the update or support all of its features. [73] Later, Microsoft confirmed that low-end devices with 512. MB of RAM (including the Nokia Lumia 520 , which represents 24.5% of all Windows Phone devices sold), [74] would also get the Windows 10 upgrade, but reaffirmed that not all of its features would be supported on these devices. [75] [76] Additionally, Microsoft stated on January 16, 2015 that low-end Windows Phone 8.1 phones will not get some Lumia Denim features. In July 2015, Bloomberg reported that Microsoft had a planned restructuring of Microsoft Mobile, which includes the Microsoft Lumia range. This would reportedly include a write down of approximately US$7.6 billion on the acquisition of Nokia's mobile phone business and a layoff of around 7,200 employees. It was also reported that Microsoft would release fewer first-party devices each year. [78] As part of a larger restructuring, the Microsoft Devices & Studios engineering group was merged with the Operating Systems Engineering Group to form the larger Windows & Devices Engineering Group. In July 2015, it was announced that the head of Surface , Panos Panay, would head the new Microsoft devices unit, which would include the Microsoft Lumia as well as various other Microsoft hardware products such as the Band , HoloLens , and Xbox. In October 2015, Microsoft launched the first Lumia devices running on Windows 10 Mobile : the Lumia 950 , Lumia 950 XL and Lumia 550. [5] [6] [7] In February 2016, the Lumia 650 , which also runs Windows 10 Mobile, was launched. [80] Sales of Lumia devices declined between fiscal years 2015 and 2016, with phone revenue decreasing by $4.2 billion or 56%. When Microsoft announced the acquisition in September 2013, 7.3 million devices were sold in the quarter, but this shrunk to 1.2 million at the quarter ending June 2016. [81] Since the Lumia series make up 95% of total Windows Phone/Windows 10 Mobile sales, the operating system market share also shrunk along with it. [82] Throughout 2016 Microsoft slowed down production volumes of Lumia devices, and it was speculated that the series would be discontinued by the end of 2016. CEO Satya Nadella said in November 2016 that the company is working on the "ultimate mobile device". [84] The device was unofficially dubbed by journalists as the " Surface phone", and there were rumours of a late 2017 launch. Shortly after the discontinuation of the Elite X3 , [86] HP's attempt to bring Windows 10 Mobile to a niche market, Microsoft's corporate vice president Joe Belfiore confirmed that Microsoft will no longer sell or manufacture new mobile devices. The existing devices will receive bug fixes and security updates only. See also: Windows Phone version history. Nokia and Microsoft Mobile have released several updates unique to Lumia devices which feature a combination of firmware and software updates. The latter of these includes imaging improvements, new technology support, feature updates, and bug fixes. Because Lumia devices exclusively use Windows Phone, major operating system updates are often bundled with the firmware updates upon release.. Similar to how Windows Phones receive operating system updates , Lumia update releases are dependent on carriers who decide if and when devices are to receive them. [87] However, operating system updates are not subject to these constraints if users are part of Microsoft's Windows Insider or Preview for Developers programs.. 000000002013-08-15-0000 August 15, 2013 [89].

The first digit (or the first two digits for devices with four-digit model numbers) indicates the device's family, with larger numbers generally denoting a higher-end device. Under Nokia, numbers larger than 10 indicated a phablet (e.g. 1320 , 1520 ) or tablet ( 2520 ). Since the sale of the Lumia line to Microsoft, four-digit model numbers have been discontinued, with larger models instead being denoted by an "XL" suffix (e.g. The second digit indicates the generation of the device, based on the operating system it originally shipped with:. The third digit is used to distinguish between variants in the same family and generation. 0 indicates the base model, while other numbers indicate either a minor upgrade (e.g. 920 and 925 ), a 4G-capable variant (e.g. 730 and 735 ) or a regional or carrier-specific variant..
