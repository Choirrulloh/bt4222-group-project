It is called vivo X20 Plus UD, and although very similar to the regular X20 Plus, it does not have a square rear-mounted fingerprint scanner.. vivo X20 UD as seen on TENAA. The vivo X20 UD will come with 6.43 screen with Full HD+ resolution. The display is an OLED panel since this is what the in-screen scanner needs to work.

more ... more .... more ... more .... The first phone with in-display finger scanner, Vivo X20 Plus UD, gets a price and release date. The first phone with in-display finger scanner, Vivo X20 Plus UD, gets a price and release date. by Daniel Petrov. Tags :. Android - Android + Display - Display +. Vivo previewed for us the world's first phone with in-display finger scanner at the CES expo in Las Vegas earlier this month, but never named the device , and didn't disclose important details like its price or release date.. Well, today is the day when the company right those wrongs, and announced the full scoop on the. Vivo X20 Plus UD - yes, it's a mouthful, but we would expect nothing less from a phone that stands out in one particular aspect among its equals. Needless to say, the phone is very similar to the already announced X20 Plus, while the UD part is added for its proprietary "under display" fingerprinting properties.. 6.43-inch screen in the 1080 x 2160 pixels format, an upper mid-range Snapdragon 660 chipset to power it through, and a hearty 3900 mAh battery to keep it ticking for a long time. The difference with the regular X20 Plus, besides the in-display scanner, seems to lie in the rear camera set, too - we have two 13 MP sensors on the UD version, instead of pairing it with a 5MP sensor like before. The 4GB RAM and 128 GB of storage round up a pretty decent offering specswise, and pre-orders in China begin as soon as January 29, with a launch date shortly after, on February 1.. The price that the first phone with finger scanner embedded in the display will command you? Well, at the equivalent of about $565 it is not cheap for Chinese standards, and you will have to add 20-30% on top of that if you want to import, but that may be a small price to pay for being an early adopter of a unique technology.

I am looking forward to the review of this phone.. (Posts: 5478; Member since: 10 Feb 2012). posted on 24 Jan 2018, 09:26. I don't get it why this feature is this exciting. I can't but think about the oleophobic coating wearing away after all those touches in that particular area after a while. And if it's not as fast as other fingerprint scanners, I wouldn't want it until they figure that out.. (Posts: 977; Member since: 07 May 2015). posted on 24 Jan 2018, 09:42. Does the oleophobic coating typically wear off on devices? I've never heard of that being an issue. Also, this fingerprint scanner is slightly slower than typical fingerprint scanners, but it still takes less than a second to unlock (granted, I'd want this to be just as fast too). It's also still quicker than face unlock on the iPhone X. Coming from a user that is used to the fingerprint scanner being on the front of the device, I can't wait for this to be implemented on more devices. It's only going to get better.. (Posts: 5478; Member since: 10 Feb 2012). posted on 24 Jan 2018, 10:21. I'm also used to it being on the front, although I am adjusted now to it being in the back. And usually, oleophobic coating does wear off with time, thus you find yourself wiping your phone more often than you used to do when you 1st bought it. I'm not hating on the idea itself, but I wouldn't want it on my phone unless they fix the speed issues, make more reliable, and of course my number one concern, the oleophobic coating.. (Posts: 10; Member since: 08 Dec 2017). posted on 24 Jan 2018, 10:28. in response to #6 Hide. I'll solve your number one concern - put a screen protector on.. (Posts: 977; Member since: 07 May 2015). posted on 24 Jan 2018, 10:48. in response to #7 Hide. That brings up a good point: would an in-display fingerprint scanner work with a screen protector?. (Posts: 5478; Member since: 10 Feb 2012). posted on 24 Jan 2018, 11:41. in response to #7 Hide. I never had a screen protector that had a really good oleophobic coating on it, they usually wear off less than 2 weeks after using them. That's why I don't install screen protectors on my phones and only on my kids' tablets.. (Posts: 977; Member since: 07 May 2015). posted on 24 Jan 2018, 16:06. in response to #7 Hide. (Posts: 520; Member since: 28 Nov 2016). posted on 25 Jan 2018, 00:49. in response to #14 Hide. Yup it also stating that it won't work if screen is cracked or scratched up. I hope manufacturer find a way so that it work even if screen is cracked or scratched coz these Gorrila glass gets scratched up after a while & are very expensive to replace. I think they should rather first perfect it instead of rushing it.. (Posts: 369; Member since: 21 Nov 2013). posted on 24 Jan 2018, 09:46. If phones would have "under display" fps, then they should at least get rid of those chins.. (Posts: 608; Member since: 27 May 2015). posted on 24 Jan 2018, 09:56. I wouldn't be surprised if Samsung has this on the front and a regular scanner on the back. (Posts: 166; Member since: 02 May 2016). posted on 24 Jan 2018, 10:30. those bezels considering big on a phone with underscreen FPS. (Posts: 311; Member since: 20 Apr 2012). posted on 24 Jan 2018, 10:31. This would be useful when the phone is sitting on a desk, as you wouldn't have to pick up the phone or enter your pin. Having the sensor on the back is better when retrieving the phone from my pocket. At this point, I think I prefer it on the back. I take the phone out of a pocket much more frequently than it sits on a desk.. (Posts: 272; Member since: 17 Jan 2015). posted on 24 Jan 2018, 13:20. I miss having my galaxy s7 laying on a table and just being able to place my index on the scanner and it opens like nothing. Can't do that with a back finger print scanner. Also, having yiur thumb naturally rest down there is so much better than fiddling trying the find the back scanner that you can't see. (Posts: 44; Member since: 23 Jan 2018). posted on 24 Jan 2018, 15:38. I own a vivo x20 and I can attest the phone is solid. Although photography on the x20 is not as good in low light as the xplay 6.

Vivo X20 Plus UD With World’s First In-Display Fingerprint Sensor Launched By Adnan Farooqui on 01/24/2018 08:10 PST. It has long been rumored that companies like Apple and Samsung have been developing sophisticated technology to integrate fingerprint sensors into smartphone displays. Neither company has done that yet but that doesn’t mean nobody else can either. China-based Vivo teamed up with Synaptics to demonstrate an in-display fingerprint sensor solution at CES 2018 earlier this month. The company has now launched the Vivo X20 Plus UD, it’s the world’s first smartphone with a fingerprint sensor integrated in its display .. The Vivo X20 Plus UD had a 6.43 inch 18:9 aspect ratio OLED display wiht 2160×1080 pixel resolution. It’s powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 635 processor and features dual 12 megapixel cameras as well as a 3,905mAh battery.. It’s the upgraded version of Vivo’s X20 Plus smartphone that was released last year. It had the fingerprint sensor on the back as most smartphones do nowadays. Vivo has worked with US-based sensor company Synaptics to incorporate the in-display fingerprint sensor into the X20 Plus UD.. We tested out the in-display fingerprint sensor at CES 2018 and found that it works very well , even if it’s slower compared to conventional fingerprint sensors. That’s to be expected, we can expect the sensor to get better in the future.. Vivo X20 Plus UD is only going to be offered in China at this point in time and the company is going to start taking pre-orders soon. It’s unclear how much this device will cost..

Vivo X20 Plus UD is the first ever smartphone with under-display fingerprint scanner. Android 7.1.1 Nougat, FunTouch OS 3.0. 6.43-inch Super AMOLED, 2160 x 1080 resolution, ~376ppi. 2.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 60 octa-core processor. 64GB internal storage, expandable via microSD up to 256GB. 12-megapixel + 5-megapixel dual rear cameras, LED flash. Vivo has been bragging about their under-display fingerprint scanner tech for quite a while now. Finally, it’s now embodied in an official smartphone with the new Vivo X20 Plus UD.. The said technology was first showcased to the public in CES 2018 earlier this month. It was demoed inside an unnamed prototype smartphone.. If it weren’t obvious, this new smartphone is exactly the X20 Plus that was released back in September last year. Only this time, the fingerprint scanner at the back is now embedded on the screen itself — making the X20 Plus UD be the first ever smartphone to have this kind of tech.. This will help Vivo to further boost the popularity of their brand as even both Apple and Samsung were struggling to figure out how to implement this kind of technology.. However, the Vivo X20 Plus UD is still a midrange smartphone. It sports a 6.3-inch Super AMOLED FHD+ screen, Snapdragon 660 octa-core processor, with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage.. It also boasts a dual-camera setup at the back and a 12-megapixel sensor in front that’s also used for its facial recognition feature.. The Vivo X20 Plus UD will be available in China starting February 1 for a price of CNY3,598 (around Php28,900). Pricing and availability in the Philippines are yet to be announced.

Vivo X20 Plus UD: In-Display Fingerprint Scanner Won't Work With Thick Screen Protectors. By Ken Manbert Salcedo On 01/25/18 AT 5:21 AM. Chinese phone maker Vivo has made the X20 Plus UD official, the very first smartphone with an in-display fingerprint scanner. Although the phone’s best feature is highly sought after by many Android phone fans, it has one disadvantage: the in-display fingerprint sensor won’t work with thick screen protectors.. According to Engadget , some screen protectors will prevent the in-display fingerprint scanner on the Vivo X20 Plus UD from working. Screen protectors must not exceed a certain thickness if users want the fingerprint scanner to work correctly. When a screen protector is too thick, it may affect the fingerprint’s reflection on the optical fingerprint sensor.. To make sure that this issue is avoided, Vivo will be including its very own screen protector inside the X20 Plus UD’s box. It’s very likely that customers will have to buy replacement screen protectors from Vivo directly if they want to make sure that the in-display fingerprint scanner keeps working as intended.. The Vivo X20 Plus UD is now available to pre-order in China and it's scheduled to be released on Feb. Vivo is using Synaptics’ Clear ID optical fingerprint scanner on the X20 Plus UD. The Clear ID sensor is only able to work on devices that have OLED displays. The scanner uses a light sensor system that is able to read fingerprints by emitting light through the gaps between the OLED screen’s pixels. If a screen protector is too thick, it may hinder the fingerprint scanner from accurately identifying the user’s fingerprint as light is reflected back to the sensor.. The in-display fingerprint scanner on the Vivo X20 Plus UD may also not work when the display is scratched or damaged in the area where the scanner is placed, according to Phone Arena. This is also why a screen protector for the new phone is a must-have for all users.. The Vivo X20 Plus UD comes with a 6.43-inch full HD 18:9 OLED display. It’s also being powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 635 processor with 4GB of RAM. The device also has a hybrid SIM slot that lets users put two SIM cards or one SIM card and one microSD card for expanded. storage, accoridng to GSM Arena .. The device is also packing a dual-camera setup on its back. The main camera comes with a 12MP sensor with an f/1.8 aperture lens, while the secondary camera comes with a 5MP sensor. Up front, the handset features another 12MP camera that also comes with its own LED flash. Design-wise, the X20 Plus UD looks pretty similar to the OnePlus 5, as pointed out by 9To5Google .. The Vivo X20 Plus UD is now available to pre-order in China. The phone will officially go on sale on Feb. Vivo hasn’t given any information if the device will be released in other markets..

Vivo X20 Plus UD with in-display fingerprint sensor gets official price tag and release date. Adrian Diaconescu January 24, 2018 9:20 am. It’s been an unexpectedly uphill struggle for self-described human interface solution developer Synaptics to put the world’s first screen-embedded fingerprint reader on a commercial smartphone, but lo and behold, that groundbreaking mobile device is now fully detailed and (almost) ready for primetime.. It’s not Samsung’s Galaxy S9, as we wanted to believe a while back , but rather a Vivo X20 Plus UD that was showcased at CES a couple of weeks ago in decent working form.. The unimaginative name betrays this new giant’s close connection to the X20 Plus , although the ambitious Chinese maker of the two “FullView” handsets appears to suggest there are two 13MP cameras slapped on the UD’s back instead of a 13 and 5-megapixel lens combo.. “UD” obviously stands for under display, where the “invisible” fingerprint scanner is located, promising security, accuracy and speed pretty much on par with “conventional” biometric systems.. Razor-thin bezels and a trendy 18:9 (or 2:1) aspect ratio for a 6.43-inch screen sporting 2160 x 1080 pixels are advertised as key additional selling points, alongside “Face Wake” capabilities, generous 128GB internal storage space, and respectable 4GB RAM.. In order to keep retail costs relatively low, Vivo chose an upper mid-range Snapdragon 660 processor as the heart of the X20 Plus UD rather than a flagship-grade SD835, pairing the SoC with a large 3900 mAh or so battery. Running a heavily modified version of Android 7.1 Nougat, the phone will kick off pre-orders in China on January 29 at the rough equivalent of $565 (CNY 3,598), ahead of an actual regional launch on February 1. Alas, there are still no words on international availability..

The much awaited Vivo X20 Plus UD has now been launched. The X20 Plus was unveiled by Vivo at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2018.. The reason why this phone is getting so much attention is because of the under-screen fingerprint scanner. At CES, the X20 Plus managed to turn heads thanks to the new technology. Vivo is the only manufacturer that managed to get the technology on a phone with the help of the first screen fingerprint scanner, Clear ID FS9500, designed by Synaptics. Although slower than the usual fingerprint scanners, it does get the job done. And considering the fact that it is the first iteration, we can hope to see it getting faster.. The X20 Plus UD features a 6.43-inch display with a resolution of 1080 pixels. It’ll be powered by the Snapdragon 660 chipset coupled with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of ROM. A 3800mAh battery will fuel the phone. On the camera front, the phone will be equipped with a dual camera setup of 24MP+5MP sensors while the front will have a 12MP sensor. The phone will come with Android Nougat 7.1.2.. The X20 Plus’ price has been pegged at 3998 Yuan , but the official price has yet to be revealed. Source | Via 1 | Via 2.

As the mobile industry ditches PIN codes, patterns, passwords for alternative methods of authentication, biometrics like fingerprints have become increasingly popular. Problem is, fingerprint sensors take up a lot of space on phones and tablets, spurring companies like Samsung and OnePlus to search for other, more compact solutions like iris scanners and facial recognition. New technologies, though, make sticking fingerprint scanners under (and in) device displays possible, eliminating the need to find a place for them somewhere else. Vivo is a pioneer in this —the Vivo X20 Plus UD, which it announced on Wednesday, is the first commercial phone with an in-display fingerprint sensor.. We’ve been hearing about the Vivo X20 Plus UD for a while, and it recently passed through China’s TENAA certification website. teamed up with Qualcomm to create a prototype phone with an in-screen fingerprint sensor. mid-2017, but partnered with Synaptics for the Vivo X20 Plus UD.. In terms of hardware specifications, the Vivo X20 Plus UD has a 6.43-inch Full HD+ (2160×1080) AMOLED panel with a 18:9 aspect ratio and an edge-to-edge design. (Synaptics’ in-display Clear ID fingerprint sensor needs an OLED display in order to function.) It has super slim bezels on the top and bottom as well as on the left and right, and 128GB of storage. Vivo X20 Plus UD houses two 12MP camera, the specifics of which weren’t announced. And it’s all powered by a 3,905mAh capacity battery and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 635 system-on-chip, and ships running Android 7.1 Nougat.. Those specifications don’t match up with the Vivo X20 Plus UD’s TENNA certification, oddly. It listed the processor as a Qualcomm 660 system-on-chip paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and the camera as a combination 12MP/5MP dual shooter. In any case, pre-orders for the Vivo X20 Plus UD kick off January 29 in China. The phone starts at CNY 3,598 (~$565), and begins shipping to retailers in the region on February 1.. It’s impressive no matter how you slice it— while Samsung and Apple have failed to bring a smartphone to market with an in-screen fingerprint sensor, Vivo has just done it..

No word on availability in other markets. Earlier this month, at CES 2018 tech show in Las Vegas, Chinese smartphone brand Vivo showcased a smartphone with in-display fingerprint sensor. That smartphone is called the Vivo X20 Plus UD, and, as promised, Vivo has finally launched this smartphone in China.. The biggest highlight of the Vivo X20 Plus UD is its in-display fingerprint scanning technology. Vivo, in a partnership with Synapctics, has brought this tech onto its smartphone. As the name suggests, the fingerprint scanning sensor on this smartphone is under the glass, which means its neither below the display or at the back of the phone.. To unlock your smartphone with your fingerprint, all you have to do is place your thumb on the phone’s display. Of course, this tech is a bit slower than the traditional fingerprint scanner that’s found on current smartphones, but, this lets smartphone manufacturers cram in bigger displays into the smartphone without having to relocate the fingerprint scanner to the back of the smartphone or just ditch it entirely in favor of face recognition (*ahem* Apple *ahem*).. Having said that, the Vivo X20 Plus UD is actually the Vivo X20 Plus that was launched last year. The Vivo X20 Plus UD flaunts a metal uni-body design with a 6.43-inch display on the front along with smaller bezels.. Above the display is a 12 MP selfie camera, and, at the back is a dual camera setup which is a combination of one 12 MP camera and one 5 MP camera. The back of the phone actually reminds us of the OnePlus 5. After all, OnePlus and Vivo are both owned by the same company – BBK Electronics.. That said, the Vivo X20 Plus UD is powered by Snapdragon 660 SoC which is paired with 4 GB RAM, however, the phone boots up to Android Nougat instead of Oreo, which is a downer. The phone comes in Black color and ships with a 3905 mAh battery that keeps things going.. So, what do you think about the Vivo X20 Plus UD?.
