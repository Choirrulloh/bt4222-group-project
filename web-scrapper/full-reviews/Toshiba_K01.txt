The Toshiba K01 features the same hardware specifications as the the TG02, but is equipped with side-sliding QWERTY keyboard that increases the overall thickness of the device with just 3mm. Moreover, it boasts an OLED screen that, according to the manufacturer, offers much clearer images and reduced energy consumption.. Not official: The information for this phone is preliminary and could be incomplete or inaccurate.. Resolution: 480 x 800 pixels. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. Data: UMTS, HSDPA 7.2 Mbit/s, HSUPA 2 Mbit/s. Notifications: Music ringtones (MP3), Vibration, Phone profiles, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 15 Feb 2010. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. This case turns your iPhone into a modular device. Samsung's updated DeX desktop experience uses the S9 as a trackpad. Facebook is testing a 'breaking news' tag for developing stories. Twitter’s ‘Happening Now’ feature groups tweets about ongoing events. BlackBerry Z10 spotted at retailers prior to BB10 event. T-Mobile chief: iPhone availability might come some time in the next three months, maybe. Toshiba's K01 is exactly what we would've liked to have seen as a complementary set to the TG01. Happily, Toshiba's given us a QWERTY option with the new model, added capacitive touch, and swapped out the earlier display for a swanky new AMOLED version. Key feel is a bit rough on the outside keys -- shift, delete, enter -- but this device still isn't final, and with all that real estate, the layout feels just great. In fact, the devices being shown on the floor are just looping a demo video and not really showing off the UI as seen above; we couldn't get any film of it, so the pics we got will have to suffice. We like what they've done here -- in fact, this could make an excellent day to day set if battery life proves good enough. We also can't help but notice the three buttons (soft touch) across the bottom that could quite easily be skinned for Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 Series , could they not?

Techblog.gr claims to have just leaked Toshiba's mobile product line for the next year, and there are threeproducts we found especially exciting—a 7-inch netbookish transformer and a series of touchscreen QWERTY cellphones.. The Toshiba K01 is a 4.1-inch capacitive touchscreen QWERTY slider. It features a 1GHz processor, 3.2MP camera and WM 6.5. The K02 is a clamshell version of the chipset, but it features a 3.5-inch touchscreen with QWERTY on the inside and a 10-button pad with a secondary LCD on the outside.. Toshiba's most exciting plan, however, is the HTC Advantage-like L01. Featuring a 7-inch screen and wireless QWERTY. It would make a heck of a netbook...if the platform weren't built on Windows Mobile 6.5. Engadget points out that when they spotted an L01 prototype earlier in the year, it was loaded with a fuel cell. All devices are planned to come out near the end of 2009 in some market or other.

Design Type called form factor refers to a mobile phone's size, shape, and style as well as the layout and position of major components of phone. There are three major form factors seen in mobile phones => bar phones, folding phones and sliding phones. 122 x 65 x 12.9 mm. SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) is a small card that contains mobile network subscriber's account information. This allows the phone using the card to attach to a mobile network. The SIM card is most commonly associated with GSM and UMTS mobile networks. Moving a SIM card from one phone to another allows a subscriber to switch mobile phones without having to contact their mobile network carrier. SIM cards can also be used by a phone to store limited amounts of data, such as phone numbers and text messages.. GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900. Display Technology => A number of display technologies and types used in mobile phones => TFT (Thin Film Transistor), IPS (In-Place Switching), OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode), AMOLED (Active-Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode), Super AMOLED (an even advanced version of AMOLED), Resistive Touchscreen (Resistive touchscreens contain two layer of conductive material with a very small gap between them which acts as a resistance), Capacitive Touchsceen (Capacitive touchscreen technology consists of a layer of glass coated with a transparent conductor). 480 x 800 pixels, 4.1 inches. Camera is able to capture photographs and usually videos, The most important characteristics of a camera are the resolution (measured in megapixels), lens focus type (fixed or automatic), higher megapixel cameras are known to capture higher quality photos, but not always a good measurement of the photos quality. OS => Every computer system run on a base software called Operating System (OS). Operating System controls all basic operations of the computer (such as smartphone, PDAs, tablet computers and other handheld devices). The Operating System allows the user to install and run third party applications (apps), apps are used to add new functionality to the device. Java for Mobile Devices is a set of technologies that let developers deliver applications and services to all types of mobile handsets, ranging from price efficient feature-phones to the latest smartphones. Java is currently running on over 3 billion phones worldwide, and growing. It offers unrivaled potential for the distribution and monetization of mobile applications.. CPU (Central Processing Unit) mostly known as processors, CPU processes instructions in order to carry out certain functions that make your device operate properly. Processors are often described as the brain of computers, smartphones and tablets, Smartphones and tablets rely on processors to carry out their every task, Processors are an incredibly important factor in selecting any type of computing device, including your smartphone. RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly, any byte of memory can be accessed without touching the preceding bytes that allows information to be stored and accessed quickly from random locations. RAM is the most common type of memory found in computer systems, smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices. Internal Storage is a data storage space (flash memory) mostly used in smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices where operating system, apps, music, photos, videos, files and other user data Is stored. Memory Card Slot is a special slot for inserting a memory card. Memory cards allow you to expand the phone's built-in memory, A memory card (sometimes called a flash memory card or a storage card) is a small storage medium used to store data such as text, pictures, audio, and video, for use on small, portable or remote computing devices such as mobile phones, mp3 players, digital cameras.. Qualcomm Snapdragon QSD8250 1 GHz processor. Bluetooth is a wireless communications technology for exchanging data between mobile phones, headsets, computers and other network devices over short distances without wires, Bluetooth technology was primarily designed to support simple wireless networking of personal consumer devices. Wi-Fi is a popular wireless networking technology using radio waves to provide high-speed network connections that allows devices to communicate without cords or cables, Wi-Fi is increasingly becoming the preferred mode of internet connectivity all over the world. GPS The Global Positioning System is a satellite-based radio navigation system, GPS permits users to determine their position, velocity and the time 24 hours a day, in all weather, anywhere in the world, In order to locate your position, your device or GPS receiver must have a clear view of the sky.. Web Browser => a web browser is a software application used to locate, retrieve and display content on the World Wide Web, including Web pages, images, video and other files, The primary function of a web browser is to render HTML, the code used to design or markup webpages.. SMS (Short Messaging Service) is a text messaging service component of phone, Web, or mobile communication systems. It uses standardized communications protocols to allow mobile phone devices to exchange short text messages over the networks. MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) is a standard way to send messages that include multimedia content (audio clips, video clips and images) to and from mobile phones over wireless networks using the WAP protocol. Email (Electronic Mail) is a system for receiving, sending, and storing electronic messages, Similar to a letter, email is text messages that may contain files, images, or other attachments sent via the internet to a recipient by using applications and software prograps. An email address is required to receive email, and that address is unique to the user.. Battery Type => Cell phones run on various kinds of batteries depending on the manufacturer, phone size or shape and features. There are basically four types of cell phone batteries => Lithium Polymer, Lithium Ion, Nickel Metal Hydride and Nickel Cadmium. Battery Capacity is a measure (typically in Amp-hr) of the charge stored by the battery, and is determined by the mass of active material contained in the battery. The battery capacity represents the maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from the battery under certain conditions. Standby Time is the total amount of time that you can leave your is fully charged, turned on and ready to send and receive calls or data transmissions before completely discharging the battery. Talk Time is the longest time that a single battery charge will last when you are constantly talking on the phone under perfect conditions, Ambient temperature and highly dependent on the cellular network environment such as the distance to the closest cell network tower.. USA Legal Limit is 1.6 W/kg - FCC SAR testing is measured in watts per kilogram (or W/kg) averaged over ONE gram of simulated biological tissue..

With two different form factors, a similar experience. Windows Phones at MWC: Toshiba K01 and HTC HD Mini. This year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona was a fruitful one for Windows Phone enthusiasts, that's for sure. Not only did the Redmond-based software giant Microsoft unveiled officially the Windows Phone 7 Series, but a nice range of handsets powered by its Windows Mobile 6.5.3 OS were also brought to the table, and some of them are more than impressive, one should agree.. Among these new handsets, we can count the Toshiba TG02, which was spotted before into the wild, receiving certifications from various commissions, and which was officially announced and showcased at the MWC show accompanied by a sliding handset from Toshiba, the K01. While the former comes with about the same features as the TG01, the latter is a brand new device, delivering not only a QWERTY keyboard, but a touchscreen display too, and which is said to be able to easily prove a powerful and easy to use media device. With a 1GHz CPU inside, support for 32GB microSDHC cards, and only 12.9mm front to back, K01 will certainly live up to its name.. Another pretty impressive device that made its debut at the MWC event in Spain is the HTC HD mini , a smaller version of the popular HTC HD2. Even if HTC reduced the size of this device, it still packed a great deal of features and capabilities in it, including a 600 MHz CPU, coupled with 384 MB of RAM, which should enable a smooth running of app on the device, such as Opera Mobile for impressive Internet browsing. In addition, one will also enjoy integration with social networking sites on the new phone, including Facebook, HTC Peep for twittering or video sharing on YouTube, not to mention that there is a new HTC Sense experience on its way to the market with the HTC HD mini.. These handsets certainly look great on paper, but the experience that they can deliver when in users' hands is the one that matters most. The guys over at WMExperts had the chance to play with these devices a little on MWC's floor, and you can take a look at the hands on photos and videos they have published with the two. There are two different form factors and two different approaches to user experience that these phones can offer, but, in the end, they resemble a lot, as both are Windows Phones.

Showcases the best of what you can get in an entry-level Windows tablet.

Among Windows tablet PCs, the Toshiba Encore 2 Write (WT10PE-A264) stands out thanks to its focus on handwriting and information capture, zeroing in on the best uses of the tablet form factor. For the student in a class, the manager in a meeting, or the journalist in an interview, these refinements to handwriting and audio recording are far better than anything else we've seen offered in this category. Combine this with solid performance and long battery life, and it's an easy pick as our Editors' Choice for entry-level Windows tablets.. Information capture taken to a new level. With accurate stylus input, and the apps Toshiba bundles, the Encore 2 Write turned out to be a far more useful tool than I’d expected. Until Microsoft adds whole-document handwriting recognition to OneNote instead of just OCR, it should remain the avatar for live information capture. With accurate stylus input, and the apps Toshiba bundles, the Encore 2 Write turned out to be a far more useful tool than I’d expected. Until Microsoft adds whole-document handwriting recognition to OneNote instead of just OCR, it should remain the avatar for live information capture. I heartily recommend it over the regular Encore 2, which is just another Windows tablet, albeit a very affordable one.. A cheap tablet that sacrifices too much. The Toshiba Excite Go is a case study in getting what you pay for. If you want an cheap gift for a child who wants to look a pictures and play casual games, it's a sturdy little $100 device that could fit the bill. The performance sits in that nebulous "good enough" space, and the battery life, while meager, is arguably sufficient for something you keep near a bedside table or on the couch.... The Toshiba Excite Go is a case study in getting what you pay for. If you want an cheap gift for a child who wants to look a pictures and play casual games, it's a sturdy little $100 device that could fit the bill. The performance sits in that nebulous "good enough" space, and the battery life, while meager, is arguably sufficient for something you keep near a bedside table or on the couch. But make no mistake: this is a decidedly unsatisfying experience. The Dell Venue 7 and LG G Pad 7.0 have their issues and will cost about $50 extra, but offer better displays with higher resolutions. And that's key: a tablet is nothing without its screen, and the display that Toshiba has outfitted here is of too poor quality to be worth your time.. Toshiba's Encore Mini is likely to be the cheapest Windows 8.1 tablet you can buy, but that doesn't mean you should buy it. 7in really is too small for the software we know and enjoy, and we're sure that anyone keen to get Windows 8.1 on a tablet will be disappointed with this one and find that i... Toshiba's Encore Mini is likely to be the cheapest Windows 8.1 tablet you can buy, but that doesn't mean you should buy it. 7in really is too small for the software we know and enjoy, and we're sure that anyone keen to get Windows 8.1 on a tablet will be disappointed with this one and find that it's almost unusable, so we'd recommend putting your £99 to better use and saving up a bit of extra cash for a Windows 8.1 tablet with a 10in screen or above.. Cuts a fine line between tablet and Windows PC. Although the specifications of the Z3735G processor don't appear to have changed much over the previous, early 2014 iteration the Toshiba Encore 2 WT8 shows us a product based on that SoC that is not as capable as Windows 8 tablets based on the earlier generation. We found differences in Turbo Boost that can affect CPU performance, elements of the GPU (mainly for video processing) that have been removed and with just 1GB of RAM we quickly saw limitations that affect multi-tasking. Given that the price of the Encore 2 WT8 is (at time of writing) not significantly cheaper than more performant Windows 8 tablets it's difficult to make a recommendation....

Given that the price of the Encore 2 WT8 is (at time of writing) not significantly cheaper than more performant Windows 8 tablets it's difficult to make a recommendation. The main competition to the Toshiba Encore 2 WT8 is the Lenovo Miix 2 8 which we have had the chance to directly compare during this review. The Lenovo Miix 2 has a similar look and feel, a similar sized battery and the same ports. The performance results are, however much better and you've got 2GB of RAM which removes at least some of the worry of virtual memory usage. The speakers aren't nearly as good on the Miix 2 8 compared to WT8. The other competitor is the Dell Venue 9 Pro which has a better screen and battery life. Toshiba have build a tidy, lightweight Windows 8 tablet with fast storage, a bright screen and good speakers that provides a smooth and enjoyable Windows RT experience and this might be enough for some but ultimately the price needs to drop for the WT8 to compete and if it gets to below $150 then it can be regarded as a reasonable Windows RT-style tablet.. Despite a nice screen, its performance is hindered by a lack of RAM. If you’re looking for a compact Windows 8 tablet at the lowest price possible, Toshiba’s Encore 2 8 isn’t a bad choice, particularly if its asking price dips even more, as other Windows 8 tablets have in the past. At $180, it’s not exactly expensive for a Windows tablet, but the only thing that really sets it apart from other similar slates is its 1GB of RAM; most older Windows 8 tablets have 2GB. That’s not a good thing, especially when the Encore 2 had occasional performance hiccups in our time with it. It’s possible, though, that future software updates will fix this issue....

That’s not a good thing, especially when the Encore 2 had occasional performance hiccups in our time with it. It’s possible, though, that future software updates will fix this issue. And while the Toshiba tablet does have a nice IPS LCD screen, so does Dell’s Venue 8 Pro. The Dell tablet, while its processor is a bit older, felt more responsive and consistent in our time with it, likely thanks to its extra RAM. And while the Venue Pro 8 launched at $300, it’s now cheaper. As of this writing, B&H Photo and Video has the Dell tablet listed for the same $180 as the Encore 2 8 sells on Amazon. Given the choice between the two, we’d go for the Dell tablet and its extra RAM.. This Windows 8 tablet goes easy on your wallet. Full-featured Windows tablets, such as the aforementioned Dell and Lenovo models, can replace a notebook (provided you add peripherals such as a Bluetooth keyboard). I can’t envision Toshiba’s Encore 2 that way—it’s more of a companion device for very light productivity and entertainment..... Full-featured Windows tablets, such as the aforementioned Dell and Lenovo models, can replace a notebook (provided you add peripherals such as a Bluetooth keyboard). I can’t envision Toshiba’s Encore 2 that way—it’s more of a companion device for very light productivity and entertainment.. But for the price, that might be enough.. Affordable for 10-inch tablet; Slim and elegant design. The Toshiba Encore 2 is an attractive choice if you're looking for an affordable 10-inch Windows tablet. For just $269, you get a slim and well-designed slate that runs Windows 8.1 with just enough horsepower to handle word processing, browsing the Web and streaming music simultaneously.

For just $269, you get a slim and well-designed slate that runs Windows 8.1 with just enough horsepower to handle word processing, browsing the Web and streaming music simultaneously. A one-year subscription to Office 365 makes it an even better deal.. Usable performance and a generous software bundle for a very tempting price. Stylus or no, however, the Toshiba Encore is still significantly cheaper than both its main rivals, it (mostly) matches both for performance, and packs in all the connectivity you need to turn it into a lightweight mobile workhorse. With a full copy of Office 2013 Home & Student onboard as well, it's a bona fide bargain..

With a full copy of Office 2013 Home & Student onboard as well, it's a bona fide bargain.. Good cameras and HDMI-out in a chunky chassis. Toshiba's Encore 8 packs some nice extras compared to rival 8-inch Windows tablets, but it's thicker and heavier than the competition..

Toshiba has complemented its launch of the TG02 by bringing out a version with a QWERTY keyboard – the K01.. As with the other model, there's a 4.1-inch capacitive touchscreen, but unlike the TG02 it has an AMOLED version.. The K01 we snapped isn't a final version. We also photographed a dummy model for the close-ups.. The main thing to note is that, like the TG02, the K01 matches the Windows Phone 7 Series hardware spec.. In other words, it has the three buttons along the bottom that every 7 Series handset will have. But they make an appearance with 6.5 first.. The slide-out keyboard doesn't add to the bulk – at 12.9mm thick it's only 3mm thicker than the TG02. It's also extremely light to hold and while the keyboard slides nicely, it perhaps comes out a little too easily. Once again though, this is an early build.. As for the keys themselves, we didn't like them as there isn't a definite enough keypress. Hopefully this will be fixed for shipping models.. Toshiba says the display quality is boosted by using technology also deployed in its Regza flatscreens. We guess this means Resolution+ for sharper images.. Like the TG02, the K01 packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 1GHz processor and has expandable memory to 32GB.. The Cactus RQ250 is a new high output portable flash.

Toshiba TG02, TG03, K01, K02 and L01 leaked. Posted By Ilinca Nita on Apr 14, 2009 | 6 comments. Toshiba’s TG01 is one of the coolest Windows Mobile smartphones announced this year, so we should not be surprised if the Japanese company will soon come with even cooler devices.. And it looks like it will, if we’re to believe a recently leaked Toshiba 2009/2010 roadmap.. Apparently, Toshiba will launch a TG02 and a TG03 in the fourth quarter of 2009.. Both handsets resemble the TG01, run on Windows Mobile 6.5 and are based on Qualcomm’s 1GHz Snapdragon processor. The difference is that the TG02 is water-resistant, while the TG03 adds a 5MP camera and a 5.1-channel speaker.. Q4 2009 should also bring us the Toshiba K01 and Toshiba K02. Like the TG02 and TG03, these are WM 6.5 smartphones based on the 1GHz Snapdragon CPU.. Toshiba K01 has a 4.1 inch touchscreen display, a 3.2MP camera and a sliding QWERTY keyboard:. Toshiba K02 only has a 3.5 inch touschscreen display, but it also features a QWERTY keyboard:. Sometime in early 2010, Toshiba plans to launch the L01 – a MID with a 7-inch display:. The Toshiba L01 will obviously use the same Snapdragon processor and Windows Mobile 6.5.. i wanted the TG01 in India by what date would it b available. http://TheHotSpotGuide.com Free_Dating_Service. Wow seems like a great product are they available?. TG01 Windows Mobile smartphone to market still wearing the “biggest screen” and “first Snapdragon” crowns while the TG02 upgraded some new procs on the way: http://bit.ly/toshiba-tg01-tg02-info.
