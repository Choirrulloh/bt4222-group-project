Toshiba TS10 - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 ». I bought one of these phones the other day. It was described as good working order. I plugged it in to charge up and it still wasn't doing anything after six hours on charge. It wouldn't switch on or showed any sign of being working.. Can't get a new battery anywhere. everybody who advertises it eventually cancels the order and refunds the money. i lost my charger where can i get one (mission impossible). I realy like this phone but can't find it anywere. Can anyone tell me how i can buy one please?. Love the phone, but cannot get a new battery anywhere!. Not to buy in Central Europe.. I had this phone since Jan 07 and is still using it. It's pretty cool to carry a phone which no one has and it look like an iPod. Most of my friends cannot find where the SIM card is placed.... I give 90 marks for a not expensive, cool, different, light and trendy phone. Well ive had my phone for over a year. When i first saw it i thought it was cool looking. Then when i got it out of the box i was shocked to find it was painted plastic !!!!. The 2 weeks later found that I couldn't not buy ANY accessories for it !! My Vodafone store couldn't or wouldn't help and said to me what do you want for a cheap phone ? Funny you wanted to sell it to me. Any ways even more miffed when I find that I cant hook it up to a PC to get all the photos I've taken with it in to the PC to print out !!. Any one know how I can do this ??? as so far NO one can help. Tried Toshiba but after spending 25 mins on the phone getting no where I gave up. I'm still using it the Phone and taking pictures, the night time setting is good for very low light photos. Tried recording my own but gave up as the sounds is dismal. I'm also wondering how do i get the phone to store Incoming Txts to the Phone an don't the sim card ? Is that even possible ? The instruction manual is not very forth coming with info. At least its compact and not heavy. Even if the battery life is very short !! an not coming with a car charger its a real pain !!. Well if any one reads this and you can help me out drop me a line daveinvicta999@yahoo.com. this phoneis the worst phone ever its slow doesn't have bluetooth or even infrared and won't play mp3's and it's boring ps the case is made of PLASTIC...... how do you change phone 2 alphabetical key's , any one got copy off the manual!. i'm thinking on buying this cellphone, but i would like to know first if its outer shell is made of plastic or metal (aluminium or whatever). the phone is useless - menue is awfull -. design nice to beautiful the rest horribly worked out -. how do you download ringtones for free without paying a subscription can you tell me plz. I really love this phone but have been trying for the last three months to get a car charger for it. Vodafone don't have any now as the phone is "old". One I bought from an independent accessories seller didn't work in spite of being specifically advertised for it. The port looks like a mini USB but it is not standard. Does anyone know where I can get one as I want to use it with a Solar powered charger (which has a Car charger socket attachment) and go "green".. well i never knew that toshiba made phones and i work in a mobile phone repair shop. this phone is a really stylish phone pretty retro looking have had no probs with phone. Can anyone tell me whether you can download ringtones, wallpaper, screensavers etc on to this phone?. firstly my english is not good but i can try.like someone saythis phone is different like the person who want to use it.of cause ihe don't have blutooht and infraport but it's nice for me to use it.thanks.

There are basically four types of cell phone batteries => Lithium Polymer, Lithium Ion, Nickel Metal Hydride and Nickel Cadmium. Battery Capacity is a measure (typically in Amp-hr) of the charge stored by the battery, and is determined by the mass of active material contained in the battery. The battery capacity represents the maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from the battery under certain conditions. Standby Time is the total amount of time that you can leave your is fully charged, turned on and ready to send and receive calls or data transmissions before completely discharging the battery. Talk Time is the longest time that a single battery charge will last when you are constantly talking on the phone under perfect conditions, Ambient temperature and highly dependent on the cellular network environment such as the distance to the closest cell network tower..
