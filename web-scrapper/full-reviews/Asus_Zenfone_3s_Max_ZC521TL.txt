Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. The ZenFone 3s Max looks good on paper, but the real-world performance is limited – and would only meet the demands of less discerning users. Yes, there’s the fantastic battery life, and that’s the sole reason one should go for this device.. Operating System Android 7.0 Nougat with ZenUI 3.0. IPS | 450nits brightness | 2.5D curved glass display | Built-in Bluelight filter. Processor MediaTek 64-bit 1.5GHz MT6750 | Mali T860 GPU. Internal Storage 32GB; expandable up to 2TB with microSD card. Rear Camera 13 MP | f/2.0 | 5p Largan lens | Dual LED Real-tone Flash | 52MP Super Resolution. Front Camera 8MP | 85° field-of-view. It’s only been three months since ASUS launched the ZenFone 3 Max, but that hasn’t deterred the Taiwanese company to follow it up with an incremental upgrade, the ASUS ZenFone 3s Max (ZC521TL).. ASUS launched the first ZenFone Max in 2015 with a focus on marathon battery life. Now, the ZenFone 3s Max packs in a 5000mAh battery compared to the 4100mAh of its predecessor. There’s also slightly better internals and minor design changes for us to get interested.. With the entire ZenFone 3 portfolio, ASUS has upped the ante in design and positioning and instead of focusing on hardware specifications, aims to bring premium experience to its users. That also means that most of their latest phones are not exactly run-of-the-mill value-for-money devices, but differentiate themselves in design, camera, battery life, etc.. But does ZenFone 3s Max offer a well-rounded smartphone experience while delivering its promise of long battery life? Let’s find out!. With the ZenFone 3 line-up, ASUS finally brought all-metal design to its smartphones much later than when most people would’ve liked. Even entry-level budget smartphones in 2016 boasted of an all-metal design.. Like its predecessor, the ZenFone 3s Max sports a metal unibody design – there’s nothing extraordinary about the design, but neither is it run-of-the-mill. The homogenous design language of the ZenFone series is apparent, a premium one at that. It is well-built and the aluminum chassis gives it a solid feel.. With this device, ASUS has done away with the capacitive navigation buttons, introducing on-screen buttons. Also, the fingerprint sensor has moved to the front below the display, instead of the back.. Since the ZenFone 3s Max is smaller than the ZenFone 3 Max (5.2-inch display instead of 5.5-inch), the former has a compact form factor. That combined with its slim bezels and rounded edges gives it nice ergonomics and it feels good to hold in the hand.. Unlike the original ZenFone Max, this one is not a brick and neither does it sport big bezels – boasting of pretty good 75 per cent screen-to-body ratio. It’s not very slim at 8.85mm, and at 175 grams, it’s not the lightest smartphone out there. Yet it is one of the lighter phones to pack a big battery, and there’s no apparent heft to it.. The ZenFone 3s Max sports a 5.2-inch HD (720p) IPS display with a 2.5D curved glass on top. The display is sharp with rich colors and the 450 nits brightness is very good, offering great sunlight visibility. The viewing angles too are quite excellent. The contrast ratio though is just average, and even on higher brightness levels, the colors are not as vibrant as I would’ve liked.. It is, however, disappointing that the ZenFone 3s max sports only an HD display when other phones in the same – and even lower – price range feature a Full HD display. It’s good that the device packs in a smaller display, so this does not become a showstopper for a lot of people. Of course, it looks a poor sight on the specifications sheet.. Powered by 64-bit MediaTek MT6750 processor clocked at 1.5GHz paired with 3GB of RAM, the ZenFone 3s Max chugs along nicely while multitasking offering a smooth Android experience. However, the chipset isn’t powerful enough as the ones powering some of the competitors. In 2017, it is a shame ASUS didn’t go for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625, a terrific SoC for mid-range smartphones. Clearly, the device is geared towards casual smartphone users – and that is where it excels.. Of course, the USP of the ZenFone 3s Max is its long battery life. There is a considerable increase in the battery capacity of the Max this time around – from 4100 mAh to 5000 mAh. The device, with the hardware it packs and the software optimizations that ASUS has done, offers phenomenal battery life. With moderate usage, I was easily able to get two days battery life on the phone, which is quite good. Using the built-in power saving features, you can even squeeze more than that! Even in random observations, like a long media streaming session or more than few races at Asphalt 8, I noticed only a drain of few percent.. The ZenFone 3s Max comes with 32GB of internal memory, further expandable by up to 2TB via a microSD card slot. The dual SIM smartphones features a hybrid slot, so you can either use the second SIM or the microSD card, but not both. The phone supports reverse charging, and can be used to charge other devices via OTG.. The fingerprint scanner can be used to answer incoming calls, launch the camera app, or take a picture. While the authentication is just fine, the recognition is a tad miss-and-a-hit. In first couple of days with the device, I would never get it right in the first try. Of course, with impulse you get used to placing the thumb exactly where the sensor wants you to, but one would expect a little flexibility there.. The ZenFone 3s Max sports a 13-megapixel rear camera with dual LED flash. Outdoors in daylight, the camera performs decent. While the color reproduction is mostly accurate, the photos lack details. The photos aren’t sharp enough, which is more pronounced when I viewed them on a 32-inch display. For most people though, who just share photos on social media, this shouldn’t be a problem.. Indoors or in low-light conditions, only some of the shots come out decent, but mostly they are very noisy with messed up metering.. On the front, there is an 8-megapixel camera that manages to click detailed selfies outdoors, and just about okay ones indoors.. The camera app on the Zenfone 3s Max is the same as on the company’s flagship ZenFone 3 smartphone. While the options are great to tinker around, including a manual mode and a super resolution mode that takes four photos to combine into one 52MP image for superior details, the camera on the ZenFone 3s Max is just average.. The first Nougat device from ASUS, the ZenFone 3s Max runs Android 7.0 out of the box with the new version of the company’s proprietary ZenUI 3.0 on top of it. Virtually, every nook and corner of the Android experience gets a fresh coat of paint.. Right up, that’s a good thing. The older versions of ZenUI were plagued with bloatware and gimmicky UI elements that marred the overall user experience. The latest version is a complete makeover, and offers a clean UI with subtle animations. There are several nifty utilities, but there’s still a plethora of ASUS-branded apps that I’ve hardly seen anyone using really. Unfortunately, only a few of these can be uninstalled and while you can disable most others, they still occupy storage space on your phone.. ZenUI 3.0 features an app drawer, and there’s a built-in search functionality. You can swipe down the screen and search the Web or your apps and contacts, and view your frequently used apps. There’s an all-new Theme Store from which users can download free as well as paid themes, wallpapers, icons, and ringtones to customize their smartphone.. The latest version of ZenUI is fluid and aims to offer stock Android-like experience while offering additional functionalities. And, it succeeds in doing that. It’s one of the better UIs out there in terms of ease of use and feels polished. Better internals would’ve made it even smoother on the ZenFone 3s Max. ASUS has reduced the bloatware this time around, but still has a long way to go in that positive direction.. The ZenFone 3s Max aims to pimp up the Max range with a premium design while improving the internals from its predecessor. It succeeds there, but there’s little else.. Like the entire ZenFone lineup, the ASUS ZenFone 3s Max is a decent smartphone. It looks good on paper, but the real-world performance is limited – the ZenFone 3s Max would only meet the demands of less discerning users. Yes, there’s the fantastic battery life, and that’s the sole reason one should go for this device.. in India, the ZenFone 3s Max finds itself in a crowded market with. better spec’d smartphones from Xiaomi and Lenovo around. it – some of them with great battery life too. The latest Max is a good enough smartphone in isolation but is not a well-rounded package one would’ve liked it to be. A few thousands cheaper, and it might have been a better buy..

ASUS ZenFone 3s Max ZC521TL: Exclusive new Release. Android OS version and ZEN UI:. ASUS ZenFone 3s Max ZC521TL Philippines Market Forecast:. Mid-End smartphones are all about sporting the best possible features at the least possible price tag. This is just what ASUS ZenFone 3s Max ZC521TL wants to aim at. This device sports multiple leading features which are sure to attract buyers.. Every manufacturer has their signature strength or feature genres with which they market their devices. ASUS concentrates more on the design and user experience rather than going for optimum hardware specs. And this ZenFone 3s Max ZC521TL is a stunning design right from the very first look of it.. Released just after the larger Zenfone 3 Max, this device comes with multiple upgrades inside as well outside. It looks better to say the least with an all-metal body, curved edges and a flat rear end. A negligible rear camera bump, side buttons and a single capacitive touch button up front are the only blemishes to its surprisingly smooth contours.. With dimensions at 73.7 x 149.5 x 8.85 mm, this model is on the larger and the bulkier side too as it weighs in at 175 grams. But this mostly comes down to its huge battery, coming to which later.. First things first, this display plays a large part in making this device look compactly chic. This 5.2 inch HD display is covered with a 2.5D glass cover up top. Ultra slim 2.15-inch bezels allow this display module to achieve a 75% screen-to-body ratio. Native screen resolution comes in at 1280 x 720 pixels. But what makes this one of the best sub 6-inch displays in this price range is the 282 PPI pixel density and its whopping 400+ nits of brightness.. ASUS ZenFone 3s Max ZC521TL has a 13 MP rear shooter with a f/2.0 aperture. The Dual-Tone flash is an exclusive addition to this price segment which also has a quick adaptive autofocus function. Still image quality is above expectations, something which also applies to the 1080p video recording capabilities. The front camera is an 8 MP module with an 85-degree lens which allows for larger frames for selfies.. What takes this camera setup to the next level is ASUS's PixelMaster software. This software allows the device to unbelievably detailed 52 MP Super Resolution grade images by superimposing multiple images with the same frame.. ASUS ZenFone 3s Max ZC521TL uses an Octa-Core Cortex A-53 processor running inside a Mediatek MT 6570 chipset. This adds up with a Mali-T860MP2 GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). Although base clock speeds come in at around 1.5 GHz, this setup scores high on multi-core performance. This is an important pointer for any mid-range smartphone as it allows users to do seamless multi-tasking functions.. This is where ASUS takes an exclusive leap over other manufacturers. ASUS ZenFone 3s Max ZC521TL comes with a larger battery than its 4100 mAh powered previous generation. This battery is a monstrous 5000 mAh unit. Not only does it lead the segment, but this is also one of the most powerful setups in the industry.. This device has an Android Nougat 7.0 with added options for updating it with the latest fixes and additions. ASUS has added their in-house ZEN UI (User Interface) software to work with the stock Android platform. This device runs on the ZEN UI 3.0.. Memory configuration comes in the form of a 3 GB RAM and 32/64 GB internal storage which can be further increased by 256 GB via microSD slots.. Philippines have come up as one of the hottest new mobile devices markets on the global stage. ASUS ZenFone 3s Max ZC521TL comes with numerous exclusive features for its price tag, something which no other devices have. It has created strong hype in Philippines and looks to continue the same with positive sales figures.. Reviews of ASUS ZenFone 3s Max ZC521TL.

The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM..

News Asus Zenfone 3S Max (ZC521TL) Review. Asus Zenfone 3S Max (ZC521TL) Review. The Zenfone 3S Max (ZC521TL) excels in the battery department, but is there more to it? We review to find out.. Published: February 7, 2017 12:29 PM IST. Asus Zenfone 3S Max Battery Life. Late last year, Asus launched two smartphones under its Max-series with focus on battery life – Zenfone 3 Max (ZC520TL) and Zenfone 3 Max (ZC553KL). Both smartphones featured an identical design with differences in the chipset and screen size — one featuring a MediTek SoC and 5.2-inch HD (720p) display, and the other featuring a Qualcomm SoC and 5.5-inch full HD (1080p) display. Now, four months later, Asus has introduced a new variant called the Zenfone 3S Max (ZC521TL), an incremental update over the lower-end ZC520TL model.. The new smartphone brings a slightly powerful chipset, minor design refinements, Android Nougat OS and a larger 5,000mAh battery, compared to 4,000mAh on the previous model. Priced at Rs 14,999, the smartphone will go head-to-head with the Lenovo P2 which also features a 5,000mAh battery and prices starting at Rs 16,999. There is also Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 , with prices starting at Rs 9,999 and going all the way up to Rs 12,999 for the top end variant with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage, all featuring 4,100mAh battery. After having put the Zenfone 3S Max through its paces for over 10 days, here’s my review.. Compared to the Asus Zenfone 3 Max (ZC520TL), the Zenfone 3S Max comes with quite a few changes. The new and improved design looks more refined and gorgeous too. The metal unibody and the curved edges adds to its distinct design elements. The front is dominated with the 5.2-inch display with 2.5D curved glass on top. Above the display, you have the sensors, selfie camera module and the earpiece.. The fingerprint sensor is now located on the front and embedded inside the physical home button. It’s a welcoming move — when the phone is placed on the table, you don’t need to lift it to scan the fingerprint, as in case with the rear mounted sensors. The sensor is pretty accurate in scanning the fingerprint, and I hardly faced any issues. However, my only complaint is that you have to press the button to first wake the device and scan your fingerprint.. Asus has also gotten rid of the capacitive navigation buttons and moved them on screen. However, with its a bad move as the space besides the fingerprint scanner is completely wasted. Having the capacitive navigation buttons could have created more real estate on the display.. Talking about the ports, the 3.5mm audio jack is placed on the top, the micro-USB port at the bottom, the hybrid dual-SIM card tray is placed on the left edge, whereas the volume rocker and power button is placed on the right edge. Asus phones always had the concentric circle pattern, but the same is missing from the Zenfone 3S Max, except on the power / sleep button.. Coming to specifications, the Zenfone 3S Max features a 5.2-inch HD (720p) display, which is tad disappointing as even smartphones priced under Rs 10,000 now feature full HD (1080p) panels. The display is bright enough and legibility under direct sunlight is no issue either. The viewing angles are good too. Colors may not be as punchy as one would want, but they are more sober looking. Also, despite being an HD panel, the text appears adequately sharp, and I don’t have any complaints.. The smartphone is powered by a MediaTek MT6750 octa-core SoC (eight Cortex A-53 cores). It’s sad to see Asus use MediaTek SoC that’s made on 28-nanometers process, when a better option — Snapdragon 625 SoC made on 14-nanometer process was available. No, I’m not biased towards Qualcomm SoC, but the 14-nm process offers the required performance and efficiency. Also, the MediaTek SoC supports maximum screen resolution of 720p, whereas Qualcomm one would have allowed Asus to go for a full HD panel instead.. The chipset is paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB onboard storage. The smartphone also features a microSD card slot allowing you to further expand the storage. It’s a hybrid slot, allowing you to either use one micro-SIM card and one microSD card, or one nano-SIM and one micro-SIM.. In the photography department, you get a 13-megapixel rear camera of aperture f/2.0 with a dual-tone LED flash. Up front, there is an 8-megapixel selfie camera of aperture f/2.0 for selfies and video calling. Connectivity options include dual-SIM 4G VoLTE, Bluetooth, GPS and Wi-Fi.. The smartphone runs Android 7.0 Nougat out-of-the-box, wrapped under Asus’s ZenUI 3. You get all the Android 7.0 Nougat goodies such as improved doze mode, split screen multitasking, improved data saver and more. The interface is similar to what we’ve seen on other Asus phones, but it is slightly stripped down. The drag-down notification panel is now translucent, which kind of looks good compared to the old, boring white background.. When I first booted the Zenfone 3S Max, for a couple of days the interface was buggy, but after an OTA update with performance improvements and bug fixes, it is now snappy. However, the update did add one bug which I noticed — the Bluetooth A2DP doesn’t work, which means you won’t be able to listen to music on your stereo Bluetooth headphones. I did do a factory reset, but it didn’t help either. It could be a problem with our review unit.. Asus ZenUI and bloatware are synonymous, and the same is present on the Zenfone 3S Max too. These include ZenTalk, ZenFone Care, ZenCircle, WebStorage, QuickMemo, MiniMovie, Go2Pay, Do It Later, Although Asus has cut down on the number of preinstalled apps, only some of them can be uninstalled. Rest of them, you either have to deal with them, or just disable them.. The combination of MediaTek SoC and 3GB of RAM ensure smooth functioning of the device. After the initial hiccups, I didn’t really face any major issues throughout my usage. Even with a few apps running in the background, multitasking was a breeze. Also, I didn’t face any issues when switching between apps in the split-screen mode. The mode works both, in landscape and portrait mode.. Multimedia performance on the smartphone is decent. The audio output on of the speaker is quite loud, but the audio sounds a little muffled when playing low-frequency sounds. On a good pair of headphones, the audio sounds well balanced. Coming to videos, the smartphone is able to play full HD (1080p) videos without any hiccups, but sadly the SoC does not support 4K video playback. But that’s not something we expected from a smartphone in this price segment anyway.. Asus has included a new ‘Game Genie’ feature that boosts the gaming performance on the smartphone. As soon as you start a game, the Game Genie icon appears, and you can move it anywhere along the screen too. Besides offering speed boost by clearing RAM, the feature also lets you record your game or live steam on Twitch or YouTube platforms. I played casual games such as Subway Surfers and Temple Run 2, both ran without any issues. Also, I didn’t face any difficulties while playing graphics intense games such as Asphalt 8:Airborne.. [Click to see the camera samples shot on the. Coming to camera, the performance is sub-par. Under bright outdoor conditions, the 13-megapixel rear camera on the Zenfone 3S Max is able to capture decent photos. The sensor isn’t able to capture punchy colors, nor crisp details. Indoor shots completely go for a toss and graininess is visible. Low-light photos further take a hit, with most of them looking just bearable. Also, the selfie camera performs well outdoors under bright lighting conditions, but the degradation in quality is noticeable indoors under ambient lighting conditions.. Now, coming to the key highlight of the smartphone, the 5,000mAh battery. Asus claims that the battery is good enough to offer up to 28-hours of talktime on 3G and up to 25 hours of web browsing time over Wi-Fi. In real-world usage, I’ve managed to go two full days without charging. Under the manager app, there are four modes — performance, normal, power saving and super saving.. On performance mode with brightness at 60 percent and switching between 4G and Wi-Fi, I was easily able to get screen on time of six hours till the battery dropped to 10 percent. My usage includes phone calls for an hour, social networking for about two hours, three email accounts in sync, some gaming during my commute and listening to music in background.. After putting the phone on normal mode, which adjusts brightness and CPU performance for better results, I was able to stretch the screen-on time a little over seven-and-a-half hours with same amount of usage. On a weekend, I charged the Zenfone 3S Max to 100 percent on Friday night, and with limiting network usage only when needed, the battery lasted till Monday morning, with five percent still left.. Sure the battery life is good, but during my 10 days usage, couple of times I noticed some erratic behavior too, with some battery hogged by cell standby and Android OS. On one night, I had 38 percent battery, and with background apps cleared and networks disabled, after I woke up eight hours later, the idle battery drain was 29 percent and only 9 percent remained. I think this would have to do with the software issues I discussed earlier.. If I had to nitpick one thing, it would be lack of fast charging. It takes full four hours to charge the battery from 0-to-100 percent. Of course, it does last really long, but with most smartphones now coming with fast charging capabilities, it would have been a nice addition, especially for enabling users to plug in the smartphone for about 30 minutes and get an entire day’s worth of usage.. As with the earlier Zenfone Max-series smartphones, the latest Zenfone 3S Max also delivers on the promise – a stellar battery life. It hits the right spots with the compact form factor, an eye-catchy and premium design, good display quality and a decent overall performance.. But here’s the thing, battery life is no longer a pressing concern for most modern smartphones especially with the advent of power-efficient chipsets, especially the Snapdragon 625, which allows manufacturers to not go for excessively big batteries and use better displays without compromising on the battery performance. We have seen the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 that offers far better hardware and available for much cheaper than the Zenfone 3S Max.. Yes, in isolation the Zenfone 3S Max is a good smartphone that provides a battery that would last you for a couple of days, but it is not a well-rounded smartphone and consumers have better options out there in the market. Had Asus priced this smartphone under Rs 10,000, it could be a different ball game altogether.. Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 Octa-Core 2.0GHz Processor. 13 MP with AF, dual-LED flash.

News Asus Zenfone 3s Max (ZC521TL): Hands-on and first impressions. Asus Zenfone 3s Max (ZC521TL): Hands-on and first impressions. The Zenfone 3s Max features an improved chipset and a slightly larger 5,000mAh battery. Published: January 30, 2017 12:00 PM IST. Asus Zenfone 3s Max Hardware Performance. Barely three months after launching the Zenfone 3 Max (ZC520TL) and Zenfone 3 Max (ZC553KL) in India, Asus has now introduced a slightly powerful smartphone in the Zenfone Max-series. Called Zenfone 3s Max (ZC521TL), it is an incremental upgrade to the Zenfone 3 Max (ZC520TL), and brings slightly better specs sheet to the table. There are minor changes in the design too. With the Zenfone Max-series, Asus has focused on offering smartphones with outstanding battery life. Now, while the Zenfone 3 Max (ZC520TL) was fuelled by a 4,100mAh battery, Asus has equipped the new Zenfone 3s Max with an even larger 5,000mAh battery.. Ahead of the formal launch, I had a chance to spend some time with the smartphone and here’s what I think about it.. The Zenfone 3s Max features a metal unibody design. On the front, you have the earpiece, selfie camera and ambient light sensor sitting above the display, and a fingerprint sensor embedded inside the home button below the display. Asus has done away with the capacitive navigation buttons, and they are now onscreen. The previous Zenfone 3 Max (ZC520TL) model had the fingerprint sensor placed on the back, and featured capacitive navigation buttons below the display.. The edges are rounded and the smartphone’s compact form factor makes it easier to hold the phone in one hand. On the left edge, you have a hybrid SIM card slot that accepts one micro SIM card, and one nano-SIM card, or one microSIM and one microSD card. The power button and volume rocker is placed on the right, 3.5mm headphone jack on the top and micro-USB port at the bottom. ALSO READ: Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) Review. Talking about specifications, the Zenfone 3s Max features a 5.2-inch HD (720p) display, with 2.5D curved glass on top. However, it is quite disappointing to see an HD display when competitors in the same or lower price range feature a full-HD display. At the heart of the smartphone is MediaTek’s 64-bit MT6750 octa-core SoC clocked at 1.5GHz paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage. In comparison, the Zenfone 3 Max (ZC520TL) featured a MediaTek MT6735 quad-core SoC clocked at 1.1GHz.. The chipset still isn’t powerful enough as the competitors, and I can’t figure out why Asus didn’t go for Qualcomm Snapdragon 625, which is one of the best mid-range chipsets today. ALSO READ: Asus Zenfone 3 ZE520KL, ZE552KL receive Android 7.0 Nougat update. For shutterbugs, there’s a 13-megapixel rear camera with LED flash. The camera supports video recording up to 1080p (30fps). We clicked some photos to see test the camera, and it’s an average performer. Even the photos shot in day light looked sub-par, macros looked decent but they weren’t the sharpest and lacked details. For selfies, there’s an 8-megapixel selfie camera, which does a good job outdoors, but quality drops indoors. I’ll be putting the camera through its paces when I review the smartphone.. Coming to the USP, the 5,000mAh battery Asus claims is good enough to offer backup of two days or more on single charge. During my brief usage, I watched a couple of. episodes for a total of 40 minutes and played some games such as. for total of 30 minutes, and unlike smartphones the battery on the Zenfone 3s Max just dropped by 16 percent. The phone also supports reverse charging, meaning you can use it as a power bank to charge other smartphones. I’ll thoroughly be testing the battery from full charge to discharge cycle over the next few days, so stay tuned for the detailed review.. On the software front, the smartphone runs Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. A layer of Asus’s Zen UI as over the top customization is also present, but it looks much neat and cleaner than the previous iterations. Asus also seems to have gotten rid of some bloatware, but not completely. For a couple of days I found the UI to be a bit buggy, but then Asus pushed a small 30MB update with bug fixes and performance improvements, and now it feels a little better.. As of now, Asus hasn’t revealed its pricing, but the smartphone is expected to be priced under Rs 16,000. In that price range, the Zenfone 3s Max will directly compete with the Lenovo P2 , which is priced at Rs 16,999 and also comes with a 5,000mAh battery. There is also Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is powered by a 4,100mAh and the top end variant with 4GB RAM + 64GB is priced at Rs 12,999.. ALSO READ: Lenovo P2 Review. For those who can compromise on the battery bit, there is also Lenovo Z2 Plus with prices starting at Rs 14,999 and is powered by Snapdragon 820 SoC, 3GB of RAM, 32GBstorage and a 3,500mAh battery.. ALSO READ: Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Review. To sum up, the Zenfone 3s Max is another battery focused smartphone from the company. However, with competitors such as Redmi Note 4 and Lenovo P2 also offering good battery backup along with better specifications on paper, it remains to be seen if it has any extra tricks up its sleeve. detailed review of the Zenfone 3s Max, and we will let you know if it’s worth spending your money..

But in overall Redmi note 4 is. a smart choice as it offers a good value for money though it comes from a brand that promises to give best specs and budgeted range. So if you have that much budget to buy j7 pro, then go for it, else go for redmi note 4. I would not recommend Asus phone as I have very bad experience with it. I am personally using redmi note 4 and I'm very satisfied with it, and recommend it very strongly, it good at every aspect.. 1 more answer(s) | Spam?.

Asus Zenfone 3s Max ZC521TL - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 4 5 ». is zenfone 3s max memory expandable to 64GB?. Yesterday [6/01/2017] Only, I have bought asus zenfone 3s max mobile phone today one side touch is not working, unfortunately i put my sim in this mobile phone, and i complained to the customer Care they are not giving proper response so please don't purchase any mobiles in asus company itz my suggestion, my friend also have many issues in this company now only i came to know..... Hi, I bought zenfone 3s max on 15/09/2017 and in just 3 months my phone started creating problems. First It seems that battery backup is too good but now it just take 12 hours to drain the whole battery. After 10% it just takes 5-10 mins to turn off the phn. Phone started hanging apps closed automatically. But the worst part is recently my phone screen got broken on slight fall even after there is a screen guard on it. And when I went to customer service centre for screen replacement they asked me for Rs 4100/- even my phone was in warranty period saying that we will not give free replacement for broken screen. And when I said that it is too costly as the phone price is rs 11000 and 4100 is not worthy, I will replace it from grey market at only rs 1500/- you just see other problems as it comes under warranty like battery and phn hanging problems. But they refused to do so. You first have to replace our screen and that too under company service centre by paying 4100/- rs. Means you dont have any other option to go. This is how this company make fool of customers. I just asked the company representative that why you didnt tell you shopkeepers selling Asus phone that they should tell the customers about this company policy at the time of selling phones but he just said that sorry we cant do that. And when I argued him then he said that just go and just talk to shopkeeper from where you purchased this phone. I request all that pls dont buy any of the Asus phone otherwise you will also trapped in this worst policies of this worst companies.
