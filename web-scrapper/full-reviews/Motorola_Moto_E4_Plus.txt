The Motorola Moto E4 Plus is an affordable, well-built phone with a big battery that will last for well over a day of use.. If you hate it when your phone runs out of battery, we have an inexpensive option for you. The unlocked Motorola Moto E4 Plus ($179.99 as tested) has a massive 5,000mAh battery that will carry you through two days of moderate use, or up to a week of standby. It's also nicely built, runs the latest version of Android, and works on every carrier in the US. It isn't the fastest phone out there, and the Moto E4 remains our Editors' Choice for being a slightly better value, but if you need a phone with the longest battery life possible, go for the Plus.. The Moto E4 Plus is different enough from the Motorola Moto E4 that it's confusing Motorola isn't using a different name. The base E4 is a 5-inch phone, with an 8-megapixel main camera. The E4 Plus is a 5.5-inch phone with a 13-megapixel main camera. We tested the $179.99 unlocked model, but it's also available directly from Verizon for $129.99, or from Amazon Prime (with Prime ads) starting at $139.99.. The E4 Plus is a budget phone, to be sure, but a nicely built one. It's big, at 6.1 by 3.1 by 0.4 inches (HWD), with a smooth, warm plastic body that comes in gold or gray. On the front is a 5.5-inch, 720p LCD that's bright enough, but noticeably soft compared with higher-res screens like you find on the Moto G5 Plus. It'll best please older users who want larger visual elements.. View All 5 Photos in Gallery. There's a capacitive home button/fingerprint sensor below the screen, but no back or window buttons: those appear on the screen itself. If you want to reclaim screen real estate, you can turn the on-screen buttons off and swipe back and forth on the fingerprint sensor for the back and window actions.. The phone charges and syncs over micro USB, and there's a standard headphone jack on the top. You're here for the battery, though. The 5,000mAh cell isn't technically replaceable, but it's probably serviceable: remove the back, and the battery's in there with a sticker on it that says, "WARNING: DO NOT REMOVE." (We didn't.). The phone lasted 11 hours, 44 minutes on our video rundown test, which is extraordinary compared with the regular Moto E4 (5 hours, 30 minutes). It even lasted longer than our former battery champion, the LG X Power , which showed 8 hours, 48 minutes in the same test. And given that Motorola phones have very little standby battery drain, you'll easily be able to go for two days without a charge.. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 427 processor here is one of the latest for low-end phones, and it's sluggish, but it's the best you can expect at this price point. Motorola has one of the best approaches to Android: The E4 Plus runs Android 7.1.1 , the latest version, with a few subtle extensions like a notification display that wakes up when you pick up the phone. Launching, and occasionally quitting, apps definitely takes a noticeable amount of time, and game frame rates tend to be quite low. If you use a lot of apps, you should step up to a Snapdragon 600-series device like the Moto G5 Plus.. The E4 Plus has 16GB of storage, of which 10GB is available, and 2GB of RAM. There's a microSD card slot for cards up to 256GB, and you can move some apps onto the SD card, although they slow down further if you do. Once more: if you're going to use a lot of apps, go with a faster phone.. The earpiece is plenty loud, although voices sound just a bit muddier than they do on a high-end handset like the Samsung Galaxy S8 or LG G6. The phone supports T-Mobile's and Sprint's HD calling, as well as both VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling. The speakerphone has a bit of a crackle in it at maximum volume, but the phone's mics are excellent, with terrific background noise cancellation. Even on a busy street, my voice came through very loud and clear.. The E4 Plus joins Motorola's other G and E phones in being some of the rare unlocked phones that work on all four major US carriers. The LTE band layout and modem setup focuses more on coverage than on speed, so you'll get the best possible coverage on all four carriers, but not their top speeds.. The phone's Category 6 modem lacks the ability to combine spectrum bands for greater speeds, so you'll see slower performance here than you will on a high-end phone like the Galaxy S8. Tested against the Galaxy S8 on T-Mobile's network in the same location, I got consistently higher download speeds on the more expensive phone, and consistently much higher upload speeds (to the tune of 20 to 30Mbps vs 2 to 4Mbps).. The same pattern follows with Wi-Fi — strong coverage, but not top speeds. The phone supports dual-band 802.11 a/b/c/n, though not ac, but Wi-Fi remained functional even 100 feet from a router, through a wall. There's no NFC, though, so tap-to-pay solutions are out.. The E4 Plus sports a 13-megapixel main camera and 5-megapixel front camera. You don't get the "twist to camera" action that Moto offers on its higher-end phones, so you must launch the camera by dragging up from the corner of the lock screen.. Both cameras have flashes, and the main camera has an f/2.0 aperture. In good light that makes for fine photos, although there's a noticeable delay with the shutter sometimes that reminds you that you're using a low-end phone. Low-light images with flash aren't bad, although the flash takes more than a second to stage. Unfortunately in low-light, flashless pictures are poor, because of a lack of good focus — they're soft at best, and downright blurry at worst. The front camera's shots aren't as blurry in low light, but they have overly dramatic shadows.. The primary video camera takes 1080p videos at 30 frames per second outdoors, dropping to 24fps in standard indoor lighting. The front-facing camera was able to balance at 30fps in testing both indoors and out. Neither camera is stabilized, which means they appear a bit wobbly, but that's par for the course on low-end devices.. The Moto E4 Plus is our low-end battery champ, beating beefy competitors like the LG X Power on endurance. But the added cost of the big battery puts the E4 Plus in a slightly awkward place. At $180 unlocked (or even at $130 on a carrier), it comes very close to the $185 Amazon Prime subsidized entry-level price for the Moto G5 Plus, which has a noticeably better screen and faster processor.. Motorola is really on a roll with its low-end phones. The E and G series continue to be great values, with their fresh versions of Android, solid reputation for reliability, and four-carrier compatibility. Your choice between the E4 Plus and the G5 Plus really depends on your charging style. If you're the kind of person who takes your phone to work every day and plugs it in, the G5's faster performance and sharper screen will be the right choice. If you don't have chargers frequently accessible, the E4 Plus will keep you connected longer. The plain-old Moto E4, meanwhile, remains our entry-level Editors' Choice because it's a great value for the price.. Bottom Line: The Motorola Moto E4 Plus is an affordable, well-built phone with a big battery that will last for well over a day of use..

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. by Preslav Kateliev. Motorola - Motorola + Android - Android +. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction In the world of smartphones, the true rock stars are often the top-tier heavy-hitters — your Samsung Galaxy S-es, your iPhones and Premium Xperias. These are devices that are filled to the brim with the latest and greatest in commercially available hardware and carry a justifiably high price tag for that. But there are also a few that become popular for going in the opposite direction — handsets that make the most out of the low-end hardware they're built around and provide the budget conscious with a surprisingly solid user experience. Motorola 's Moto G series is loved for just that reason — they are known as some of the best bang-for-the-buck phones you can go for, with a snappy interface and good camera performance. But there's also the Moto E family of handsets. On one hand, they have always been even more affordable than the Moto Gs, but on the other, they have had the reputation of phones that don't shine in any one department beyond pricing. With the introduction of this year's Moto E4 , Motorola added a Plus variant, with a higher-resolution camera sensor and a massive, 5,000 mAh battery. It seems that, for the first time in the line's existence, it may have its own heavy-hitter all while not breaking the bank. Let's take a closer look at it and see what it's about. In the box: Moto E4 Plus Charger with fast charge support Micro USB data cable Quick guide booklet Design The E series gets its fingerprint badge Without meaning to sound mean, we'd describe the Moto E4 Plus as an adorable little brick. Yes, it's back cover is made of metal and its matte finish feels nice to the touch. However, in today's smartphone world, we would say that its design looks just “plain” and it's a bit too chunky, though that's understandable given the 5,000 mAh cell that it holds inside. Do not get us wrong, we are by no means calling it “ugly”, but rest assured that it won't be turning any heads when laid down on a table. In an unforeseen turn of events, the camera module at the back is not a protruding hump, but a caved-in dimple. Our minds are at ease that laying the phone down on a hard surface would not result in any damage to the camera lens, which we appreciate, but we fear that the circular pocket's rough edges may eventually get filled with dust and grime, which would be hard to get out. We wish the dimple had more of a slant to its walls, making it easier to for dust to just slide out. The power button and volume rocker are clicky, with a nice amount of travel to them, but we did find their positioning to be slightly awkward for the way the phone handles. The fingerprint scanner is a new addition to the Moto E family and can double as a full replacement for the phone's virtual navigational buttons. It's placed in a nicely beveled ellipse under the screen and finding it by touch feels satisfying every time. Display A phablet screen that doesn't get a phablet's resolution So, as hinted by the name, the Moto E4 Plus is the bigger phone in the new Moto E pair. It carries a 5.5-inch screen, effectively making it the phablet of the duo. However, since it didn't get an appropriate boost in resolution, it still has 720 x 1280 pixels stretched across its screen making for a PPI density of 267. Seeing as today's handsets often have a super-sharp image, we dare say that this is noticeable to the point of being slightly irking. That aside, the display's colors are also consistently off target. Thankfully, nothing is oversaturated, but you definitely shouldn't be doing any shopping for clothes on this device. The screen's temperature is also slightly cold and there's an ever-present tealish tint to it. It's not a constant annoyance and may go unnoticed by the untrained eye, so we'd say we are within the acceptable margins of budget display drawbacks. As for brightness, the Moto E4 Plus' display performs great — with a maximum of 395 nits and a minimum 6 nits, neither daytime viewing nor nighttime reading will feel uncomfortable.. 6.1 x 3.05 x 0.38 inches. 155 x 77.5 x 9.55 mm. 5.78 x 2.79 x 0.33 inches. 146.9 x 70.9 x 8.4 mm. 5.91 x 2.91 x 0.38 inches. 150.2 x 74 x 9.7 mm. 6.14 x 3.03 x 0.36 inches. 156 x 77 x 9.1 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Motorola Moto E4 Plus Compare.

Could be the processor I think. Also found the signal strength terrible which was a surprise for Motorola. The screen despite what Phone Arena stated is nice and bright,colourful and doesn't look pixelated. I returned the handset cos of poor signal.

From the specs, both phones look similar: quick charger, front fingerprint sensor, 5MP front camera with selfile flash and 2GB RAM.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars It's was really easy to set up. I got this phone on yesterday. It's was really easy to set up, with a lot of apps. This phone is stylish and smooth looking and has a good amount of space for more down loads. I had the Lg stylo phone for almost 2yrs. It's also was a nice phone, but didn't have a lot of space to down load anything. But, this phone got the Lg stylo in a lot of ways. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Wow! Just dumfounded. Bought this for my mom to replace another boost branded phone. I turned it on it asked me if I was switching device's. Entered google info all synced up. This thing was so easy to setup. Now I messed around with it for an hour. Battery never budged, got a system update. The finger print sensor is very responsive, everything it zippy quick. What shocked me was I pulled YouTube up just to see how the video and sound would be..... For the cost of this phone I was blown away. What's really unique is the speaker sound comes from the ear peice. Super loud and clear picture was pretty good as well. I have a 600+ phone and to be honest if I handed you the boost phone you say you paid how much. Typical boost bloat but most can be uninstalled. From on to finish 35 mins and everything was good to go. For the price and what your getting this is a vaule. And it does have sd card, the back comes off to gain access to sd a bit tricky. There is a tab you pop in corner. I found working my finger nail around it came off the easiest. I was afraid pulling on it would break. Install SD card, snapped back and good to go. It also has quick charge via the provided power supply it charges fast! Again owing the phone I have and setting this moto up for her I just kept saying I only paid less than 100 bucks? Really!!! Gave her a crash course on it, she said I spent too much money, I finally gave in and told her how much she could not believe it either. The only thing I can't comment on is loading it up with apps. It only had 16 storage, and I don't know if it will take advantage of the SD card. I would recommend this phone all day long. My girlfriend saw it and messed with it. She said I spent too much, same story.. price and reaction was really??? She has a 500+ phone she said wow this is really nice. Oh and the pictures it takes are pretty good for the price. I picked up a case from Amazon fit like a glove. I think if I would have said I paid 200 you'd still be like wow that's a cheap nice budget phone. Yeah but I got it under a 100 .......what!!! I think you can see where I'm going with this. I just dumfounded at how can you make the price this cheap but overall for the price point t your getting way more. Sure someone would say this has low-end specs. Yes, but for someone who just need a nice phone good speed can get on the net , text , paly videos and listen to music (it has a head phone jack). This is a really nice phone with a giant 5000ma battery!!!! That's all day power and then some. I'm sure it has it's cons but honestly I just could not find any that just jumped out, I think your getting way more for a really good price.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Awesome phone! Battery last all day, even while playing music via Bluetooth.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Seamless transition (unlike any other new phone activation I've ever used!) from old phone to new via bluetooth! SO EASY!!!. I love that you can expand the memory by inserting a micro SD card in the slot by the battery. I believe you could also add a second line to this phone as there is an additional SIM card slot under the back cover. This model comes with 16 gb of internal memory and i added a 16 gb card (but could have expanded to 32gb at least, it could be more but I am unsure without looking) & have had no issues with the phone bogging down or freezing (common when a phone is running low on memory/space & was a very common MOTO issue in earlier releases of the MOTO G & E series that did not have expandable memory or removable battery). You still can not remove the battery but the back cover can be removed to access the sd & sim card slots. I absolutely love the E4 Plus and can't wait for an unlocked version of the G5 plus (so I can take it over to boost mobile) and finally get to use the MOTO mods (sadly unavailable for MOTO E4 however, I've been told the dimensions of the E4 Plus & G4 Plus are the same so...I need to do some research!!) After using this phone for the past 2 months, It is an absolute clumsy girls dream! This bad boy has been dropped HUNDREDS OF TIMES, literally, and hasn't skipped a beat yet! Dropped face down on pavement more than once and not even so much as a scratch, forget a crack! I'll be sticking with Motorola for a long time to come, the fact that they've partnered up with Lonovo is just super silky icing on an already deliciously sweeeeet cake! back in the days of flip phone, you weren't somebody until you owned a Moto Razor (RZR), I had at least 3, one was hot pink nd U loved it! you could run those puppies over with a pickup and never miss a call or text! Then after going on an LG & Samsung S3 kick I found my way to the original moto G and fell in love all over again! the Moto G froze a lot tho and had no expandable memory, the batteries got hot and fried the phones so after my 3rd failed phone I went back to LG for a cpl years. I am SO happy to be back with a Moto! and I can honestly say that any reservations that i had are long gone, this is a beautifully designed phone and it is so user friendly that even an old school techno noob will feel like a millennial once they get their hands on this!!. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Favorite phone. So far my favorite of the dozens of phones I have owned. Was this review helpful to you?.

Esto también se puede leer en español.. Moto E4 Plus has a crazy-big battery for a dirt-cheap phone. by June 12, 2017 8:12 AM PDT. It's too soon to say if the Moto E4 Plus' 5,000mAh battery will take us two full days on a single charge -- not without testing it first -- but the newly announced phone from Motorola certainly has our attention.. Larger than the E4, also announced Monday, and brawnier in the specs department, this update to the Moto E line brings you Android for cheap. To the tune of $180 or £159 (that converts to about AU$270).. While we don't know exactly when the Moto E4 Plus will go on sale (this could vary by region), we do know that it comes with Android 7.1 Nougat -- that's the latest software since Android O isn't out yet --. and Motorola's nifty trick that turns the fingerprint reader into a home button you can also use to navigate..

http:/ / www.phonescoop.com/ articles/ article.php? a=19452. Motorola's latest budget handset is the battery-busting Moto E4 Plus. This phone has one of the longest-lasting batteries we've tested this year. If you're in the market for an affordable Android smartphone that keeps going and going and going, the E4 Plus should be at the top of your list. Here is Phone Scoop's in-depth report.. The Moto E4 Plus from Motorola takes everything that's great about the Moto E4 and amps it up to 11. It isn't a high-end smartphone, but this affordable, big-screened device may be the best option for those who prioritize battery life over everything else.. Editor's Note: The Moto E4 Plus carries over nearly every feature from the Moto E4. As such, some of the text in this review is shared with our review of the Moto E4. Rest assured, we have fully evaluated the Moto E4 Plus — particularly the larger screen, bigger battery, and improved camera — and made sure this review fully reflects all aspects of this specific model.. Motorola's entire line of smartphones has adopted some obvious, over-arching design characteristics. First, there's the over-sized, round camera module. You'll easily spot it on the back of the E4 Plus. It is similar to those on the recently announced Z2 Play and Z2 Force. Then there's the indented Motorola "M" logo on the back. Let's not forget the gently rounded top and bottom corners with curved ends.. I think Motorola is playing with a double-edged sword here. Surely a consistent design language has some benefits; you can tell this is a Motorola phone. On the flip side, it strips away individuality and personality. The Moto E4 Plus is a little devoid of both.. I don't expect entry-level handsets to set the bar for high design, but the E4 Plus is a boring slab that tells you exactly where it stands: near the bottom. Available in black or gold, the E4 Plus is nondescript in most every respect. The front is covered in reflective glass and a single plastic shell wraps around the rest of the phone. The plastic has a matte finish that contrasts with the sparkly glass. I do like the way the side edges flow into the rear panel, which itself is slightly curved from side to side. The curves are friendly to your hand, but the phone's lines are plain. Only the crazy camera module gives the E4 Plus any sort of visual appeal.. The 5.5-inch screen means the E4 Plus is similar in size to an iPhone 7 Plus or Google Pixel XL. It's above average as far as the footprint is concerned. I think most people will still be able to hold and use the Moto E4 Plus comfortably for hours at a time, but those with small hands may find the phone too big. The phone is somewhat chubby at 9.6mm thick, though I've seen worse. At close to 6.4 ounces, the E4 Plus is weighty. You'll notice when it's in your pocket.. Motorola may have selected a fine piece of glass to form the phone's face, but the rear shell is an odd mix of metal and plastic. I noticed one uneven spot along the seam of the frame and rear panel that bugged me. Otherwise, Motorola did a good job assembling the phone. The rest of the chassis components all appear to fit together well.. The Moto E4 Plus has pretty much exactly the same face shared by Motorola's entire 2017 lineup. The glass fills the majority of the front. It's glued into a thin plastic frame. The joint between the glass and plastic frame is tight, but it has a slight lip. You can sometimes feel this lip and I wish you couldn't. The thin frame around the display is then glued to the main chassis piece that forms the sides and portions of the rear.. The gold model doesn't hide anything on the phone's front. The user-facing camera, sensor, earpiece, and LED flash are all plainly visible in the E4 Plus' forehead. The Moto logo is barely visible at all, painted in between the earpiece and display. The bezels around the display are very thick, a dead giveaway that this is an inexpensive handset.. You'll note the indented fingerprint reader below the display. The button is easy to find and use. By default, it's set only as a fingerprint reader, but you can turn on some navigation features so it behaves more like a home button (see the Moto App). With the nav features enables, the fingerprint reader can serve as a trackpad that allows you to navigate back or access the app switcher when you swipe left or right, respectively. You won't find any other controls below the display because the E4 Plus uses on-screen buttons to interact with the Android user interface. However, if you turn on the fingerprint reader navigation controls on, the on-screen controls go away.. Motorola settled on a fairly typical arrangement of buttons and controls for the Moto E4 Plus. The finely-textured screen lock button is on the right edge, about at the phone's waist line. It is small, the profile is barely adequate, though travel and feedback are improved when compared to the same button on the E4. The smooth-textured volume toggle is above the screen lock button. It has a better profile, and similarly improved travel/feedback. The 3.5mm headset jack is on top, the microUSB port is on the bottom.. The rear panel of the E4 Plus is wholly different from that of the E4. The E4 has a single, removable piece of plastic that covers the entire back of the phone. The E4 Plus switches things up. It relies on a thick frame to create the side edges and distinct plastic end caps at the top and bottom of the phone. Most of the rear surface is made from a metal plate fitted into the large plastic frame. I'm not really sold on the way it looks, but I appreciate that Motorola added some metal to the design. The circular camera module stands out visually, if not physically. It's about the size of a half dollar and, surprisingly, is flush with the phone's rear surface.. Removing the rear panel is an incredible pain in the butt. The clasps that hold it in place are very secure and you have to exert a ridiculous amount of pressure to get it apart. With the cover removed, you'll find the dual SIM/memory card slot on the left edge of the phone.. The E4 Plus is well short of waterproof. Like many other Motorola phones, the E4 Plus's interior is coated with a water repellant that will make liquid roll off without damaging the circuitry. It can handle some, splashing, rain, and mist, but I wouldn't hold it under a running faucet and you definitely shouldn't let it go for a swim.. The E4 Plus is a well-made phone from Motorola that offers plenty of functionality for its form.. The 5.5-inch LCD panel — an increase of half an inch when compared to the E4 — has the same 720p HD resolution. Only low-cost phones have 720p (or lower) resolution, and there's no question Motorola selected this screen to keep the E4 Plus's cost down. With a density of 267 pixels per inch, you can spot individual pixels when you hold the phone close to your eyes, such as when swiping through Facebook in bed. That said, most graphics, images, and text on the screen look sharp and free of pixelated edges.. The LCD panel puts out plenty of light and I had no trouble viewing the screen indoors. Outdoor viewability was hampered by the high reflectivity of the glass. I had to crank the brightness all the way and even then visibility was scattershot. You'll find yourself seeking shade quite often. Colors were accurate and viewing angles very good. The quality of the display matches the price point well.. Motorola sells an unlocked version of the E4 Plus online, which we tested on AT&T's network in and around New York City. The phone showed a strong connection to AT&T's network throughout the metro area. I took it on a jaunt on the highway, and the phone was able to keep Google Maps running in real-time navigation mode the entire way without fail. I didn't see the phone drop to 3G, and it never lost the network completely.. Data speeds were decent, but not the best I've seen on AT&T's network. The phone was able to connect phone calls under the worst signal conditions and it did not drop any calls. It performed really well from a wireless perspective.. The unlocked model has wide support for U.S. LTE bands and should work on most any carrier.. I was pleased with both the volume and clarity of calls I made with the Moto E4 Plus. The phone was easy to hear in crowded spaces and voices cut through cleanly thanks to the punchy speaker. Truly, the E4 Plus does a fine job connecting people and allowing them to speak to and hear one another. Those I conversed with through the Moto E4 Plus said I sounded really good.. The phone supports advanced calling features on all four major networks, which, on most, translates to HD Voice through VoLTE. As long as you and your caller are both using capable newer phones on the same 4G network, the sound is incredibly clear.. The earpiece speaker doubles as the speakerphone, something we've seen on Motorola handsets before. The earpiece produces plenty of volume when in speakerphone mode, and in fact you need to be careful not to blast your years. I was able to hear it plainly in a bustling coffee shop, in the car, and on city streets. Clarity is a bit mixed, as the speaker is prone to distortion when pushed too hard.. Ringers and alerts are loud enough to get your attention, and the vibration motor produces plenty of buzzy noise.. Here is where the Moto E4 Plus really shines. The phone packs a whopping 5,000 mAh battery, one of the largest available in a phone, period. The phone consistently pushed right through one and a half days, and sometimes managed to live through two days. It's one of the longest-lasting batteries I've tested this year. You won't need pricey Moto Mods to keep the E4 Plus up and running; it offers all the battery life anyone could need.. The Moto E4 Plus supports rapid charging via the included cable/charger. Charging the phone for 30 minutes should give you half a day's battery life. You'll find only the basic Android battery saver tool on board, though I don't think you'll need it.. The Moto E4 Plus's secondary radios all functioned as I expected them to. I made several calls via my car's hands-free system and they sounded pretty good. Music had a reasonably full sound when passed through a good pair of Bluetooth headphones. The phone had no issue connecting to other phones, accessories, and PCs for swapping files and such.. Google Maps and the E4 Plus's GPS radio worked in perfect sync. The phone consistently located me within a few seconds and was accurate to about 20 feet. Real-time navigation between points worked very well.. The E4 Plus doesn't have NFC.. Top Five Budget Handsets of 2017. Not everyone has the means or the desire to spend $1000 on a smartphone. There's good news: phone makers spent 2017 shoring up their ranks of budget-friendly devices, which now offer an incredible amount of performance for the dollar..

The E4 Plus aims to take everything people love about the series and make it bigger.. But while budget specs might work well on a smaller phone, heading into phablet territory is trickier.. Does the E4 Plus have what it takes to keep reviewers happy and offer a compelling value to those looking for a big-screen experience at a small-screen price?. Reviews are out! Let’s see what they have to say…. Unlike many budget and mid-tier phones, the E4 Plus sports a metal back and chassis. Though some reviews found the phone bland, they liked how it felt in the hand. Digital Trends called it “unremarkable, but not at all offensive.”. Many reviewers mentioned the heft of the phone. But they were quick to point out it was never uncomfortable. The added space to accommodate the massive battery also means you won’t find the slim bezels and trim lines of many of this year’s other releases.. those with small hands may find the phone too big.”. The same comments regarding chunky dimensions carried over to the front of the phone. Reviewers noted sizeable bezels wrapping around the 5.5-inch display. Worse still, if you’re looking to binge watch movies or play the latest games on your phone, you might not have the best experience.. The 720p resolution struck reviewers as fine for text and basic use. They also liked the color and viewing angles on offer.. However, reviewers noted it was easy to see pixels when close to the screen. Some also had issues with reflections and glare in bright environments.. Phone Arena summed up opinions on the display well saying, “Seeing as today's handsets often have a super-sharp image, we dare say that this is noticeable to the point of being slightly irking.”. The phone’s 1.4GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor and 2GB of RAM kept the phone moving at a steady pace for most. Yet, reviewers were quick to point out that steady doesn’t mean fast. Heavy multitasking or graphics-intensive games brought long loading times and stutters.. With 16 or 32GB of storage space and microSD support, you should have no trouble keeping your favorite apps, albums or a season of your latest TV obsession onboard. Reviewers also noted that Motorola was light with their treatment of Android 7.1.1 Nougat.. The phone’s 13MP rear camera and 5MP front-facing lens earned praise. Phone Scoop said, “I was pleased with the majority of shots I captured with the E4 Plus. They were sharp, colorful, and properly exposed.”. While low-light shooting wasn’t as good as what you’ll find in a high-end phone, reviewers found results acceptable. Apart from slow autofocus speeds, many found their shots respectable and with minimal noise compared to pictures captured on similarly priced phones.. One thing stood out in every review—the battery. Sporting a 5,000mAh cell, reviewers had zero problems making it through a full day. This included gaming, web browsing and other power hungry tasks. Many made it two days plus before having to hit a charger.. Unfortunately, when it’s time to charge, things take a while. Motorola didn’t include Quick Charge support with the Moto E4 Plus. Instead they opted for their own Rapid Charge technology.. Overall, reviews for the phone are positive—particularly for its price. However, power users and media lovers might want to look at something with more power or a better display. Digital Trends summed up opinions well, saying, “The design is fine, and the performance is respectable, but the humongous battery is the real reason you’d buy an E4 Plus. The Moto E4 Plus comes with much better battery life than both its cheaper sibling, the Moto E4, and the more expensive Moto G5, but if you’re after for a more powerful phone with a Full HD screen you may be better off going for the G5 despite its higher price. However, if battery life is your.... Both the Moto E4 and the Moto E4 Plus reside at what might be described as the bottom end of the market. With prices that are rock bottom, they are not targeting consumers looking for especially capable hardware so it should come as no surprise that performance is not on par with a mid- or top-tier.... The 5.5-inch Moto E4 Plus tackles one of the biggest problems with the smaller Moto E4 by delivering all-day battery life in an affordable device.. The Moto E4 Plus is a solid phone for $179. It will last you days, the processor is plenty fast, it can run all of the crucial apps with no issues, and the price tag is hard to beat..

The Moto E4 Plus offers a solid performance, but as it so often happens, better is the enemy of good. Lenovo should have definitely given the Moto E4 Plus a performance upgrade compared to its smaller brother, because there are many smartphones with higher performance around in this price range.... The Moto E4 Plus offers a solid performance, but as it so often happens, better is the enemy of good. Lenovo should have definitely given the Moto E4 Plus a performance upgrade compared to its smaller brother, because there are many smartphones with higher performance around in this price range. The smartphone has also only partly kept its promise of extremely long battery runtimes and falls behind other comparison devices with smaller batteries.. A decent device for its price. It lacks bloatware and lasts reliably for a couple of days on a single charge. Motorola’s Active Display is great for checking notifications on the fly, and the fingerprint reader seems to have no issues reading my fingerprints. It supports microSD cards and has a 3.5mm headphone jack. It lacks bloatware and lasts reliably for a couple of days on a single charge. Motorola’s Active Display is great for checking notifications on the fly, and the fingerprint reader seems to have no issues reading my fingerprints. It supports microSD cards and has a 3.5mm headphone jack. Ads can be intrusive and annoying at times, but become “normal” and fairly easy to ignore after getting used to things, or simply removed for an extra $50. The device could have used more RAM, and the 16GB model probably won’t suit most people’s needs for very long before having to offload media elsewhere to free up some room. Finally, the cameras are okay at best, and really only seem to work well under optimal conditions.. Affordable, incredibly long-lasting battery, smooth performance. The Moto E4 Plus is one of the best devices at its price point, offering unparalleled battery life and performance that defies its modest hardware. While the G5 Plus is certainly worthy of consideration, the E4 Plus is more budget-friendly.. The Moto E4 Plus is one of the best devices at its price point, offering unparalleled battery life and performance that defies its modest hardware.

As long as you don't mind the larger and heavier footprint, the Moto E4 Plus delivers huge gains in battery life and camera quality. These make it a better option than the E4 in my eyes, despite the cost and size differences.. Motorola didn't do anything to spice up the phone's design, but the rear panel has some new metal that I like. The large screen is nice and bright, while wireless and voice performance were above average for this class of device. The battery life — close to two days — is killer, and reason enough to buy this phone. The E4 Plus outlasts most other phones on the market right now.. Now that the Moto E4 Plus is ready to roll in the United States, we’ve got an interesting price/value proposition on our hands. Straight from Motorola online this device is available for $179, no strings attached. As such, this device is quite easily one of the best long battery life basic-... Now that the Moto E4 Plus is ready to roll in the United States, we’ve got an interesting price/value proposition on our hands. Straight from Motorola online this device is available for $179, no strings attached. As such, this device is quite easily one of the best long battery life basic-function smartphones on the market for this price.. This isn’t a phone that’s going to blow your mind with chip performance. It’s not here to be a mobile news reporter’s best friend for high-quality photos and/or video. But it’ll get you your emails and it’ll let you send a Tweet like nobody’s business. And it’ll do this for hours, and hours, and hours on end.. Dangerously close to the perfect budget phone. The Moto E4 gets dangerously close to being the perfect combination of budget phone give and take. Sure, it's slow, but the battery lasts forever. Yes, the display resolution isn't great, but it's a big screen, and I think most people tend to prefer that anyway. It doesn't skimp on the really imp... The Moto E4 gets dangerously close to being the perfect combination of budget phone give and take. Sure, it's slow, but the battery lasts forever. Yes, the display resolution isn't great, but it's a big screen, and I think most people tend to prefer that anyway. It doesn't skimp on the really important stuff - it works on all four major carriers, the camera is usable, there's a decent fingerprint scanner, you can buy one with enough storage - but it does leave a few things off my checklist for an "ideal" budget handset. Specifically, I'd really, really like to see NFC and a slightly more modern chipset. But aside from those two things, I find it hard to fault the E4 Plus given its price point..
