Roydon Cerejo , 24 February 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Blade A2 Plus features a 5000mAh battery with fast charging. Overall performance is pretty average considering the price. The ZTE Blade A2 Plus retails for Rs. With the Blade A2 Plus , ZTE is going the Xiaomi route by making its smartphone exclusive to the online platform. The phone is available exclusively via Flipkart at a tempting price of Rs. 11,999 and looking at the specifications, it appears to be a direct competitor to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. The big highlight of the ZTE Blade A2 Plus is expected to be its battery life, as the phone boasts of a 5000mAh battery. On paper, it seems to check most of the boxes by packing in VoLTE support, metal build, an octa-core SoC with 4GB of RAM, and a 13-megapixel PDAF camera. But how does this translate into actual, real-world performance? Is it really as good as it looks for the price? Let's find out.. ZTE Blade A2 Plus design and build The phone is built really well thanks to the metal housing however, the design feels a little generic and boring. It’s not an attention grabber for sure, so the ZTE Blade A2 Plus is not for those who love to flaunt their smartphone in public places. We also found it fairly chunky to hold and heavy when placed in your pocket. The addition of the larger battery has caused some bloat which has pushed the thickness of the phone to 9.8mm and the weight to 189 grams.. The front of the ZTE Blade A2 Plus is dominated by the display as we have a backlit, capacitive navigation buttons below. The white backlight for the home button also doubles up as a notification light, but the intensity is very dim, making it impossible to see outdoors, in daylight. There are buttons on the right and the SIM tray to the left of the phone. You can use two SIM cards here or a single SIM and a microSD card of up to 128GB. We also have a headphone socket on the top and a Mico-USB port down below.. Around the back of the ZTE Blade A2 Plus, there’s the fingerprint sensor, dual-LED flash, and the primary camera. The implementation of the fingerprint sensor is similar to the Honor 8. ( Review ), where the sensor is placed on a physical button allowing you to trigger certain shortcuts depending on how you press it. This can be customised in the Settings app, under the Super Key menu.. The ZTE Blade A2 Plus features a 5.5-inch IPS display with a full-HD resolution and Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The panel produces good colours with decent viewing angles. There’s MiraVision optimisation present too so you can enable features like dynamic contrast and a blue-light filter. The glass on the display also has curved edges, making it easy to grip.. In the box, we got a 13.5W charger, SIM ejector tool, and instruction manuals. The packing is very basic, which shows ZTE has made every effort to keep the costs down. Good build aside, the Blade A2 Plus comes across as a very standard looking smartphone with very little to get excited about, aesthetically speaking. It is fairly heavy and it’s not the slimmest phone out there, which might not sit well with some.. s ZTE Blade A2 Plus specifications and features The ZTE Blade A2 is powered by a MediaTeK MT6750T octa-core SoC, similar to the one we tested on the Vivo V5 ( Review ). Benchmark scores point to pretty average performance as we got 43989 points in AnTuTu and 16fps in GFXbench’s T-Rex test. During actual usage, the user interface runs pretty smoothly but slight stutter starts creeping in when using multiple tabs in Chrome and there’s considerable lag when using the camera app. This is a bit odd considering the phone has 4GB of RAM, which is generally plenty and we didn't face such issues with this SoC in other smartphones.. The ZTE Blade A2 Plus also packs 32GB of storage, Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, GPS, FM radio, and USB OTG. In terms of sensors, you only get an accelerometer and a proximity sensor. 4G support is present along with VoLTE.. The Mifavor 3.5 OS is based on Android Marshmallow, which frankly, isn’t the best looking interface we’ve come across. There are editable toggle switches in the drop-down notification shade whereas swiping up from the bottom gives you options to change the theme’s colour, wallpaper, shape of the icons, and transition effects. The Settings app has the stock Android design and here, you have access to gestures and motion triggers for tasks; the ability to switch functionality of the two capacitive keys; and set how the phone responds to the optional leather case. Other functions include a Family Mode, which replaces the existing icons with larger fonts for ease of use; a Samsung-like activity tracker called Slife; and a self-service app call ZTE Cares. There are many third-party utility app also pre-installed but thankfully, all of them can be uninstalled if you want.. ZTE Blade A2 Plus performance The Blade A2 Plus is a bit of a handful when you’re out and about but it handles day to day operations decently well. The touch response of the display could have been better and we don’t like the fact that it smudges very easily. The fingerprint sensor works well and the shortcuts that you program do come in handy. The phone doesn’t have the best SoC for multitasking as every now and then, there’s a noticeable intermittent lag. The back of the phone also gets warm very quickly, even with mildly stressful games like Rayman Adventures.. The stock video and music player handle most files well enough, including FLAC. Audio quality is strictly average through the mono loud speaker but it slightly better with earphones.. The rear 13-megapixel camera is the weakest link in the phone as its performance leaves a lot to be desired. Despite having PDAF, focusing speeds are very slow in daylight and nearly unusable in low-light situation. The camera also really struggles with macro shots as it’s very difficult to get a lock on your subject. Landscapes shots in daylight have decent detail but the colours are dull and muted, which only gets worse with HDR enabled. There’s also plenty of visible chromatic aberration. Details and colours are very muddied in low-light stills.. (Tap to see full-sized ZTE Blade A2 Plus camera samples). The front 8-megapixel camera on the ZTE Blade A2 Plus is alright for selfies in good lighting but don’t expect much otherwise. Video recording maxes out at 1080p but the framerate isn’t steady and the resulting video looks jittery with low level of details and poor colours. The camera app is pretty basic as you only get picture-in-picture mode and panorama as there’s no special mode for video like slow-motion etc.. You have an option to apply filters and there’s a gesture mode for taking selfies when you make a ‘peace’ sign, however the latter doesn’t work all the time and when it does, it tends to randomly snaps a selfies even when you're not making the gesture.. Battery life seems to be the main selling point for the ZTE Blade A2 Plus and this is one area where the phone doesn’t disappoint. The phone ran for 14 hours and 48 minutes in our loop test and with moderate usage, we were able to go up to two days before having to charge it. The Blade A2 Plus also supports MediaTek’s Pump Charge feature and using the bundled adapter, we were able to get a 25 percent charge in about 40 minutes. It’s not as quick as OnePlus’ Dash Charge or Qualcomm’s latest Quick Charge technology, but its better than having nothing at all.. Verdict Rs.11,999 is a very tempting price indeed for a phone that looks pretty sorted on paper, however the reality is very different. By making it an online exclusive, ZTE has certainly achieved a great price point. But the Blade A2 Plus’ only selling point seems to be the good battery life, as overall, it’s a pretty mediocre smartphone.. It’s definitely not a good all-rounder as Xiaomi’s offering so if you do manage to snag one, we still recommend it over the ZTE. Alternately, you can even look at the Asus ZenFone 3S Max. ( Review ), which we recently tested and found it to be a pretty good smartphone for the price.. Redmi Note 4 vs Honor 6X vs ZenFone 3S Max: Which One Should You Buy?.

Mobiles / ZTE Mobile Phones / ZTE Blade A2 Plus Price in India. User Visits: 1,092 Compare. The Chinese handset maker, ZTE has churned out some blink and miss smartphones in the past and has never been acknowledged as a premium brand. Of late, the brand has been trying to up the game in budget Android segment and has launched several commendable handsets. One of these handsets is Blade A2 plus, which is intended to take on the likes of Xiaomi and Motorola in under INR 15000 price bracket. Here is a brief overview of the device to know whether the device is equipped to fend the competition or not.. 5000 mAh battery : One of the first thing that caught our attention in this handset is the massive battery that it packs under its hood.

Curved Glass display : The handset maker has equipped this device with a brilliant 5.5-inch display that offers a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels.

Hybrid SIM slot : This has become a standard feature for all budget segment smartphones and offers flexibility to the user. However, it is not so flexible for those who are dual SIM users and also want to expand the memory of their handset.. One of the cons that has been pointed out in every review of the handset is that the camera on it are average at their best. The 13 and 8 megapixels snapper on the rear and back panel, respectively are only good on paper. Both cameras struggle not only in low light but also in good lighting condition..

ZTE is a Chinese multinational that makes telecom equipment and software to run the hardware and smartphones. They have been trying to make it big in the Indian market trying to duplicate the success of Xiaomi, OnePlus and even Vivo to some extent. The company had launched Nubia Z11 and N1 last year in December for Indian customers and we reviewed the Nubia Z11 Mini before that.. So without further ado, let us see if the Blade A2 Plus has what it takes to be the new budget favourite.. ZTE Blade A2 Plus comes with a dull and unimpressive design with nothing new to offer. One thing to note is that the device does feel solid and sturdy. The front of the smartphone has the 5.5-inch display with IPS LCD panel. The bottom houses a circular icon to signify the capacitive home button with the back button on the left and multi-tasking button to the right. The orientation of the buttons can be changed from the settings menu.. The top of the front houses the front camera, speaker grill and proximity sensor. The power button is located on the right side of the device a little towards the top from the middle with the volume rocker towards the top.. The SIM tray is located towards the top on the left side of the smartphone. Blade A2 Plus comes with a metal back that can't be removed with plastic portions towards the top and bottom of the metal back.. side sports the fingerprint sensor towards the top middle portion just below the camera and LED Flash module.. One significant part about the fingerprint sensor in this phone is the ability to customise the functionality of the smartphone. The fingerprint scanner comes with a clickable button to enable additional functions like gestures to see photos, take screenshots, selfies and other things like navigating the gallery.. Last but not the least, the smartphone comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top side of the smartphone along with a microUSB port for charging and file transfer.. The phone also sports the main speaker grill for the smartphone on the bottom side.. ZTE Blade A2 Plus sports an octa-core MediaTek MT6750T processor clocked at 1.5GHz and a Mali-T860 GPU. It comes with 4GB RAM along with 32GB internal storage and Android Marshmallow 6.0 out of the box. If you are running out of storage space then you can add a microSD card up to 64GB in the second SIM slot. A2 Plus packs a 5.5-inch Full-HD IPS LCD display with an effective resolution of 1080x1920 at 401ppi display density covered with Gorilla Glass 3 for additional protection.. ZTE has added a 13MP camera module along with LED flash on the back. This camera module is capable of shooting video at 1080p resolution at 30fps. In addition, the phone sports an 8MP camera module on the front.. Blade A2 Plus is equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Wi-Fi Direct, hotspot, Bluetooth v4.0, GPS with A-GPS, microUSB v2.0 port with fast-charging support depending on the max current supplied by the adapter and USB On-The-Go support. The smartphone also provides 3.5mm headphone jack on the top side of the smartphone and FM Radio support along with Dual (one normal Nano SIM slot and the second one which is a hybrid SIM slot where you can either insert a Nano SIM or a microSD card at any given time) SIM slots.. The company has added Fingerprint sensor on the rear side of the smartphone right below the camera module. You get a 5000mAh lithium-ion non-removable battery.. ZTE Blade A2 Plus has a respectable 5.5-inch Full-HD display with an effective resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels with 401ppi pixel density. The display has an IPS LCD capacitive display which is not as amazing on paper but the display seems to hold on its own during daily usage. The screen is reflective and you will face discomfort while working in direct sunlight and will need to re-adjust or go into a shaded region.. The LCD IPS display provides decent viewing angles despite seeming a bit dim in terms of brightness when viewed from sides. But overall, I had a good time while reading, web browsing, gaming or watching videos on the display. The colours, contrast and vibrancy of the display were fairly decent at all times. There is no special mode for outdoors and I wish that ZTE had added something for the direct-in-sun workflow which could make working easier.. ZTE Blade A2 Plus runs Android Marshmallow 6.0 out of the box along with the custom MiFavor UI 3.0 on the top of the OS. ZTE has packed 'Power Manager" as part of its UI which gives you. total control on the power consumption of your device. I have detailed the section in the 'Battery' performance section below.. The addition of 'Family mode' is brilliant and it changes the UI of the smartphone to be more friendly to users who may get confused by Android while switching from feature phones to an Android based smartphone like my mother. Other additions like the 'Private Space' to lock sensitive contacts, photos or files is a good addition, though I don't know how secure it really is in real-world.. The company has given attention to the fingerprint sensor by giving us option for different gestures in the 'Gesture & motion' app and add other functionality in 'Super Key' to leverage the click like mechanism that turns the fingerprint sensor into a button.. It comes bundled with AccuWeather, Calculator and Clean Master (which is of no use and does not provide any additional benefit in real world usage due to changes in Android since Kitkat 4.4).. Apart from these additional features, the MiFavor UI 3.0 is nothing great, the icons and entire UI is unintuitive at best with changes that don't make any sense like the themed notification area, changed power menu and the changed mechanism to switch MiColor, Wallpaper, Icon style and Effect.. ZTE Blade A2 Plus performed just okay without any significant device freezing lag or stuttering for the majority of the review. The experience turned rocky immediately after I ran any high-level benchmark apps where the entire system came to a crawl. I also regularly suffered from micro stutters while using the phone while scrolling through long list of Google Play Store apps.. The voice quality while playing music and calling was decent with no distortion. However, it was not that loud and could be suppressed in a noisy environment or large halls.. It's not clear if ZTE has purposefully included the slow animations to make sure that users don't detect the stuttering and slowness from the slow animations. Apart from the occasional micro-shutters, MediaTek MT6750T processor coupled with 4GB RAM performed decently during all the tasks, music, gaming, web browsing and photo editing.. The smartphone scored 3923 in the PCMark 'Work performance 1.0' benchmark along with scoring 601 in Single-Core and 2539 in Multi-Core benchmarks in Geekbench 4. A2 Plus did decently but it did heat up considerably during extended gaming sessions and the performance suffered a bit in heavy games like DeadTrigger 2, Modern Combat 5 and Gear Club.. The heating was concentrated on the top area around the camera on the. back side of the smartphone but that is normal behaviour and nowhere did it reach the uncomfortable mark.. The heating was concentrated on the top area around the camera on the. back side of the smartphone but that is normal behaviour and nowhere did it reach the uncomfortable mark.. I don't want to write much about the camera that comes with this smartphone because there is nothing to write about. The camera is bad and ZTE needs to improve the camera performance of the smartphone to a whole new level for me to even consider it.. The photos have no details or textures, daylight photos are just passable with noise in them, the camera UI does not have many features except filters and low light photos are out of focus grainy mess.. ZTE Blade A2 Plus performed great in the battery life department with the smartphone matching the extensive daily usage. During my extensive testing, the smartphone performed admirably well coping with my heavy usage. It lasted a little over 10 hours during my typical day which consists of always being connected to the. internet through Wi-Fi, Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp throughout the day in addition to 1 hour minutes of music, 35-40 minutes of gaming and installing and testing new apps.. The smartphone lasted for 12 hours and 6 minutes in our PC Mark 'Work battery life 1.0' test. However, two major things missing in the offering are the USB Type-C port and fast charging it does have fast charge but that is just dependent on the current being supplied using a high powered USB charger.. The 'Power Manager' has an 'Ultra Power Saving Mode' along with a "Smart power-save" mode which modulates the processor speed depending on the usage scenario and turns off all features like mobile data, Bluetooth, GPS, and faster sleep mode to increase the battery life of the smartphone. This section also provides us option to manage the power management for the apps, check the battery usage and check which apps are draining the battery to ensure that they are used less or removed from the smartphone. One interesting part is the 'Comprehensive Power Usage Detection' button on the top in this section which gives you suggestions to optimise the power consumption of your mobile device.. ZTE Blade A2 Plus is a strictly average smartphone by the company. But despite the decent attempt at going with tried and tested way with a good battery life, there is no way that I would recommend. this smartphone to people despite the decent price point of Rs 11,999. There are much better smartphones in the market at the same price point offering a much better value for money. The best option right now for budget buyers should be the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. In fact, the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime also outperforms ZTE Blade A2 Plus in performance. Other options that you may look at is Moto G4 Plus which is priced a little higher..

Yay or nay? Using ZTE Blade with PC to connect to Internet (no wifi hotspot) Using ZTE Blade with PC to connect to Internet (no wifi hotspot). ZTE Blade A2 Plus The ZTE Blade A2 Plus doesn't really jump off the page. It excels in battery life, but it's all downhill from there.. Published Date | Last Updated. While the smartphone market has been blossoming, ZTE has so far been lurking around the corners. The Chinese OEM has a legacy, just not in smartphones, but it has made some interesting devices. The ZTE Blade A2 Plus , however, is the mark of a new beginning for the company.. But before we get to the ZTE Blade A2 Plus review, one must discuss the history. We really started noticing ZTE with the Nubia Z9 Mini ( review ) a couple of years ago. That phone had an excellent camera, rivaling flagships of its time. Though the Nubia brand is now being pushed independently, the Nubia Z11 Mini and Nubia Z11( review ) were stellar devices in 2016. In fact, while the former remains our favourite camera in the sub-15k segment, the latter is a viable alternative to the OnePlus 3.. Now, a few months ago ZTE confirmed that it’s looking at India this year, with its Blade and Axon series. The first of these is the ZTE Blade A2 Plus, and quite unfortunately, it isn’t ZTE’s best work. In fact, we used it with a Reliance Jio SIM for confirmation.. Operating System: Android Marshmallow with MiFavor 3.5 UI. The last three smartphones I’ve reviewed have all been big battery devices. Between the Lenovo P2 ( review ), Asus Zenfone 3s Max ( review ) and ZTE Blade A2 Plus, the latter is the weakest. The A2 Plus also has the smallest battery of the lot, but in real world terms, neither really matters. The device has a massive 5000 mAh battery that lasts just over 11 hours on PC Mark’s Work 2.0 battery test. This test simulates real world performance by editing documents, playing videos, browsing etc. and keeping the screen turned on. It isn’t the perfect test of real world battery life, but we’ve found it to be closer than most other battery tests out there. As far as big battery phones go, this is 45% lower than the Lenovo P2 and just about 10% lower than the Asus Zenfone 3s Max.. In practice, this translates to a day’s worth of battery life, meaning you can easily get 24 hours per charge. I streamed three episodes of Two And a Half Men with only 4% battery on the device, while gaming for half an hour takes about 4% battery too. That’s with the display turned to auto in a well lit room.. The Blade A2 Plus runs on the MediaTek MT6750 SoC, clocked at 1.5GHz. It is the same chipset that Asus used for its Zenfone 3s Max. However, this one doesn’t run on Android Nougat and it has MiFavor 3.5 UI, instead of ZenUI.. The performance, though, remains the same. The A2 Plus seems to focus too much at preserving battery life. It turns off almost all of its cores whenever it gets a chance. The first core keeps running at about 1 GHz on an average, while the other cores are shut off whenever the system is close to idle.. CPU1 remains between 1-1.5GHz most of the time, while others are easily shut off. While that is still acceptable, the real problem is in how much resources MiFavor UI itself uses. Trepn Analyser shows 30-60% CPU load when the system idle. That’s quite a lot on a phone that barely has any user-installed apps. It means in the long run, your phone is more likely to get slow as you keep downloading more apps.. I even saw some lags when loading Asphalt 8 and transitions on the game’s menus are stuttery. Similarly, Amazing Spiderman 2 showed some lags as well, much like what we saw on the Zenfone 3s Max earlier. It also tends to heat up quite easily, to about 39 degrees over 10 minutes of gaming, which leads the system to throttle.. In essence, the ZTE Blade A2 Plus isn’t a good device as far as performance is concerned. Choosing a Snapdragon 625 over the MT6750 would have been a better idea.. Perhaps the best thing about the Blade A2 Plus is its 5.5 inch 1080p display. You get 401 ppi pixel density, which is definitely good enough and while I can’t describe the colours are “popping” or “pleasant”, they are decently balanced. Black levels aren’t particularly high, but acceptable, and the contrast ratio is reasonable too. You get the drift here, don’t you? The display on the ZTE Blade A2 Plus is reasonable, but nothing worth writing home about. Sunlight visibility is fine, with maximum luminance levels of 575 Lux.. The same can be said about the UI. MiFavor UI, to me, looks quite primitive. The big icons seem childish and in need of refinement. The UI is colourful, which some may like, and changes are mostly in the looks. ZTE has added a Super Key option, which allows you to use the fingerprint sensor for particular tasks. You can press it once for a screenshot, double tap to take a photo when the camera is open, and long press to turn on the flashlight.. It also has a bunch of gesture recognition options you can choose from. You can double tap to unlock, of course, but also draw gestures to skip music tracks etc. It’s a novel gimmick, but one that I mostly didn’t need to use. There are indeed quite a few gestures, but truth be told, I don’t find them making things better for me. Although, they surely don’t make things worse either.. Overall, ZTE’s display and UI are pedestrian, with nothing really special about them. They’re functional aspects of the device, but sadly, the only two things that you won’t always complain about.. That leaves us with the camera, which is perhaps the weakest element of this smartphone. The ZTE Blade A2 Plus has a 13MP camera on the back, and it looks and feels like a two-year old camera. The Blade series may be aimed at a simpler and more budget conscious buyer, but the market’s just too advanced for this right now.. The camera struggles to focus very often, and is slow even when it does. When shooting under low light, you see the green signal telling you that the camera has focused, whereas the viewfinder still shows a blurry image. The app itself looks primitive too. Given ZTE’s excellent Nubia UI, it is surprising that it has done such a lacklustre job with this one.. In terms of image quality, the Blade A2 Plus remains reasonably true to source in terms of colours, losing white balance on shots taken indoors and in low light. You’ll find image quality to be average and often lacking focus. Low light shots lose focus almost always. It doesn’t do well with details, producing noise in almost all light conditions - lower the light, higher the noise, and lesser the details.. The mono speaker at the bottom of the Blade A2 Plus wouldn't qualify as incredible, but it works for watching videos or movies in a silent room. I actually spent hours watching videos on the phone, without any issues. Last but not the least, the phone’s design is pretty much the same you’ve seen on Xiaomi’s Redmi Note series and many others. However, ZTE’s device has a square camera module on the back, with a horizontal dual-LED flash below it and a square fingerprint sensor placed parallelly below it.. The front bezels are slim enough, while there’s a round capacitive home button that lights up when you use it. I’m not a big fan of the back and recent button on either side of it, though. They’re just dots, with no depiction of what does what. It takes some getting used to. Moreover, the recents button actually brings up a wallpaper changing tool, instead of recent apps. For this you’ll need to long press the button. I'm actually not fond of this particular features, since you can bring up the wallpapers menu simply by swiping up on any home screen.. The front part is made of glossy plastic, which again feels old, and you’ll see the front camera, sensor hub and earpiece above the display. Personally, I’m not a big fan of how big the plastic strips above and bottom the display are, either. Given how much space the sensors, camera and buttons take, we’ve seen these being smaller, making the phone itself more compact.. The ZTE Blade A2 Plus feels big and at 189 grams, it’s somewhat unwieldy. It’s definitely not suited to single handed usage, but I doubt ZTE was going for that any way.. Overall, the design, like most other things about this smartphone, is pedestrian.. If you’ve read all of the above, you’ll gather that the ZTE Blade A2 Plus is not the phone I’d recommend. Its battery life is indeed impressive, but both the Lenovo P2 and Asus Zenfone 3s Max can do better. 11,999, you'll get a much more balanced smartphone in the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. The Lenovo Z2 Plus may be more expensive than this one, but if it's battery life you care about, that phone makes much more sense. The Blade A2 Plus is outperformed by all its competitors, and given that it will be available on Flipkart exclusively, it doesn't have the advantage of offline reach, either..

ZTE Blade A2 Plus Review: It solves the battery problems and is a good overall performer. Updated: Monday, February 6, 2017, 17:21 [IST]. 5,000 mAh Battery: Yes it lasts long and solves the battery problem Design: Premium and Sturdy build Display: 5.5-inch full HD Screen is crisp but viewing angles are a bit off Performance: Swift computing and multitasking performance Software: ZTE's custom software skin based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow Camera: Decent Camera performance and you also get RAW image format support Connectivity, Audio and call quality Verdict. Smartphones these days pack enough hardware to give your old desktop and some new ones a run for their money. However with no significant improvements in battery technology, most of the handsets these days, even some flagship ones need to be plugged in frequently, sometimes twice or thrice within a day.. Long lasting battery | Premium and Sturdy design | Swift computing and multitasking performance | Big battery can charge other phones via OTG. Camera performance could have been better | Lacks in audio performance. That said, the trend of introducing bigger and powerful battery units have become quite common lately and even the end users don't mind carrying some extra ounces in return of a longer batter backup.. And that actually make sense because you can only appreciate sleek and light design of a smartphone for initial months and it is the battery backup that matters in everyday usage in a longer run.. We have seen a number of handsets from Lenovo, XIaomi, Gionee and Asus offering bigger battery units and he latest to join the heavy duty game is ZTE A2 Plus , which is launched today at a starting of Rs. 11,999 and will be exclusively available on Flipkart.. The smartphone is backed by a large 5,000 mAh battery unit that is said to last for two days on a single charge.. We tested the smartphone and here's what we have to say about its performance.. It's 8:30 in the morning and my ZTE Blade A2 Plus review unit is 100% charged. The smartphone is configured to handle work and social networks that include two email clients, Facebook, Instagram, two separate accounts on Twitter and Snapchat.. Besides, WhatsApp, Facebook messenger and Slack will be active throughout the day that adds to continuous on-screen time. The handset is working on Airtel 4G network in Delhi NCR.. I kept the handset on navigation (Google maps) during the 90 minute stretch to my office, just to find out how much battery the GPS drains. The aux cable is also plugged in and music ain't stopping folks.. ZTE Blade A2 Plus launched in India at Rs. 11,999, sale debuts on February 6. During the 90 minute journey, I received 4 to 5 calls, checked and replied to Facebook and WhatsApp messages and also clicked a couple of shots to test the rear camera performance.. I reached my workplace and to my surprise, ZTE Blade A2 Plus still shows 92% battery which is a good start as most of the handsets with conventional battery units tend to lose at least 18 to 20% of juice in similar usage patterns.. During the first half which ended at 3 pm in my day's routine, the 5,000 mAh battery unit further discharged by 18%. I had received several calls, streamed two or three YouTube videos on Wi-Fi, and edited a number of pictures in third party editors such as Snapseed and Picsart.. I also played Asphalt 8 for about 15 minutes, used Share it to transfer data and as mentioned above, the social networking and work related apps never stopped.. I left for home around 6:30pm with 57% juice left in Blade A2 Plus.. As I reached home around 8:15 pm following the same usage pattern of GPS and music playback, the ZTE Blade A2 Plus shows 49% battery mark. Before calling it a day, I made 5 to 6 calls, checked e-mails, streamed music for over 30 minutes on a wireless speaker, texted and read some news.. At midnight, the battery displays 42% charge and I kept the phone on standby with data turned off and brightness level set to auto level.. The next morning I woke up to 41% charge left in ZTE Blade A2 Plus that shows the smartphone is still going strong and does not need to be plugged in for at least next 8 to 10 hours.. It was around 6pm in the evening that I finally put the Blade A2 Plus on charging with battery showing 3% charge.. So in total, the smartphone managed to last for a good 36 hours on a heavy usage, which means it can easily last for two days and even more if you don't play heavy games or stream YouTube videos on loop.. This is quite commendable for a smartphone of this price-point considering the fact that many flagship smartphones that does not even last a day.. To accommodate a bigger 5,000 mAh battery unit, ZTE has to make some compromises that increase the overall weight of the smartphone. Just to give you an overview, ZTE Blade A2 Plus weighs 189 grams compared to its rivals- Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 that presents a sleek design, weighs 175 grams and is backed by a 4,100 mAh battery unit.. On the other hand, Huawei's Honor 6X which also sells in the same price-point is powered by a smaller 3,340 mAh battery unit and weighs 162 grams. Besides, Lenovo P2 and Gionee Marathon M5 Plus also offer a 5,000 mAh battery unit and weighs 177 grams and 208 grams respectively.. While some can argue over weight and the overall thickness of the handsets packing bigger battery units, I personally don't mind carrying some extra ounces if the very handset can last a day longer without asking for a charge. ZTE Blade A2 Plus is one such handset that presents the right combination of design and features to deliver on everyday performance.. Coming on to look and feel, the Blade A2 Plus has a subtle design, which seems quite practical in everyday usage. The rear panel has slightly curves edges that make the smartphone fits comfortably in hands.. The top and bottom of the rear panel has two metal sub heads with criss-cross pattern that adds to the style. A 13MP camera module is placed at the top centre along with dual LED flashlight. A fingerprint sensor is integrated on a clickable button, right under the flashlight.. The metallic frame with brushed finish accommodates the physical buttons; volume rockers and power button on the right and SIM card slot on the left.. The top edge has the 3.5 mm headphone jack and the micro USB charging port rests at the bottom with two speaker grilles. The speaker grille on the right side is functional and the left one is fitted to add symmetry to the overall design.. The front of the smartphone is dominated by a 5.5-inch display covered under a 2.5D curved glass that seamlessly blends into the metallic frame. There are two touch capacitive buttons at the bottom of the display, positioned on either side of the home button. The top has an 8MP selfie camera along with an ear piece and a light sensor.. As far as usability and handling is concerned, ZTE Blade A2 Plus is comfortable to hold and can even be used with one hand. The buttons and the fingerprint sensor are placed ergonomically so that your thumb and fingers don't struggle to get the job done.. The overall weight is very well balanced and the handset does not feel hefty in everyday usage.. Overall, ZTE Blade A2 Plus brings a sturdy and practical design. The smartphone cannot be accounted as a sleek looking handset but the payback for a bigger battery is simply appreciable.. ZTE Blade A2 Plus flaunts a 5.5-inch full HD display with a resolution of 1080x1920 pixels. The display delivers good contrast levels and colours have a natural tone to them.. ZTE Blade A2 Plus will also please consumers who love to read books/news, play 3D games and watch movies on their handsets. The 5.5-inch full HD screen delivers a pixel density of 401ppi that result in crisp and sharp content.. While the content looks crisp and colours have natural tone, the viewing angles are bit unimpressive and we noticed colour shifts upon tilting the screen to different angles. This makes it a bit difficult to use the handset in direct sunlight.. ZTE Blade A2 Plus is powered by an octa-core MediaTek MT6750T processor paired with 4GB of RAM. This MediaTek chipset uses 4 Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.5 GHz and the other 4 Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1GHz.. Built on 'Reduced Instruction Set Computing' (RISC) design strategy that enables faster instructions executions, the CPU easily manages everyday tasks and can even handle intensive applications with no major performance issues.. The 4GB RAM is more than enough to offer lag free multitasking experience. You can write emails, play music, stream YouTube videos, post pictures on Instagram and chat on WhatsApp without worrying about any performance slowdown.. Like most of the Chinese Android handsets, ZTE Blade A2 Plus has a custom skin that misses an app drawer and have all the icons placed on home screens. It is based on Android 6.0 marshmallow and is mostly stock Android.. We did not notice any app crashes or lags while using the handset. The screen navigation is smooth and you also get a slew of customization options to tweak the look and feel of the handset.. The smartphone also has gesture and motion support. You can double tap to wake up the screen, flip the handset to mute the audio, enable auto call that dials the on-screen number when you put the phone close to your ear, etc. All these features can be accessed 'Gesture and Motion' section in settings menu.. Besides, you can customize the placement of touch capacitive buttons at the bottom of the display and can even set shortcuts to be accessible via fingerprint sensor placed at the rear side.. As we mentioned in the design part of the review, the fingerprint sensor is fitted on a clickable button that can be set to capture a screenshot upon a single click, launch the camera app with double click and switches on the flashlight when you long press the fingerprint sensor.. Overall, the smartphone delivers on software front with a lag free user interface that also comes loaded with nifty features.. ZTE Blade A2 Plus features a 13MP rear camera that has CMOS sensor inside and comes with phase detection auto focus (PDAF). The camera is accompanied by a dual tone LED flashlight and can even capture images in RAW format. This will please photo enthusiasts who love to tweak the images they capture from their mobile devices.. The 13MP rear camera captures good quality images in daylight conditions. The color tones look natural and the camera software do not add any artificial saturation to the images. Besides, the images captured have good level of detailing. Here are some images captured in daylight.. While the camera performance is good when the light is sufficient, it is the low-light performance where the 13MP CMOS sensor fails to impress. It struggles to focus on the subject and leads to blurry shots if your hand is not still.. The camera app has a total of 9 filters that allows you to enhance the mobile photography experience. The camera also has Electronic Image Stabilization to support video recording that goes maximum to 1080p resolution in 30fps.. The 8MP front camera is quite a good performer when it comes to click selfies. The images have good detailing and you can even capture selfies in HDR mode. The selfie camera app also has gesture mode to click selfies.. As far as connectivity is concerned, ZTE Blade A2 Plus offers all the required options. The smartphone has Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth and OTG reverse charging that allows you to charge other mobile devices with the help of large 5,000 mAh battery unit. Besides, the radio-frequency module fitted in the handset also supports 4G LTE and VoLTE connectivity.. You can use two nano SIM cards at a time or one SIM card and a microSD card that can expand the storage by up to 128GB.. We used the handset with Airtel 4G in Delhi NCR and did not face any call quality issues.. The audio performance delivered by the right speaker grille is not up to the mark and you have to use earphones to enjoy music while you tune in to your favorite tracks or watch movies.. At an aggressive price of Rs. 11,999, ZTE Blade A2 Plus is a good budget Android handset for users who are looking for a smartphone that can easily last for two days and offer a good overall performance.. The smartphone has a premium and sturdy build quality, crisp 1080p screen, lag free user interface and enough RAM to tackle intensive multitasking without breaking a sweat.. The only weak point seems to be its camera performance where it lacks behind from the competition..

Digit Mobile Phones ZTE ZTE Blade A2 Plus ZTE Blade A2 Plus Review. ZTE Blade A2 Plus Review. Published Date | Last Updated. Our Verdict ZTE Blade A2 Plus: Detailed Review View post on imgur.com. ZTE Blade A2 Plus Price in India 11999/- Notify When Available. The ZTE Blade A2 Plus doesn't really jump off the page. It excels in battery life, but it's all downhill from there.. The ZTE Blade A2 Plus is pretty much average. It does have long battery life, but is outdone in every department by its competitors. Unlike the Nubia series, this isn't ZTE's best work.. CONS Sub-par camera Sub-par performance Heavy CPU loads. Subscribe here to further receive Related Stories, Product Reviews, Launches & Best Deals. Since this device is currently not available for purchase, please leave you email to be informed of it's price & availability in future.. While the smartphone market has been blossoming, ZTE has so far been lurking around the corners. The Chinese OEM has a legacy, just not in smartphones, but it has made some interesting devices. The ZTE Blade A2 Plus , however, is the mark of a new beginning for the company.. But before we get to the ZTE Blade A2 Plus review, one must discuss the history. We really started noticing ZTE with the Nubia Z9 Mini ( review ) a couple of years ago. That phone had an excellent camera, rivaling flagships of its time. Though the Nubia brand is now being pushed independently, the Nubia Z11 Mini and Nubia Z11( review ) were stellar devices in 2016. In fact, while the former remains our favourite camera in the sub-15k segment, the latter is a viable alternative to the OnePlus 3.. Now, a few months ago ZTE confirmed that it’s looking at India this year, with its Blade and Axon series. The first of these is the ZTE Blade A2 Plus, and quite unfortunately, it isn’t ZTE’s best work. In fact, we used it with a Reliance Jio SIM for confirmation.. Operating System: Android Marshmallow with MiFavor 3.5 UI. The last three smartphones I’ve reviewed have all been big battery devices. Between the Lenovo P2 ( review ), Asus Zenfone 3s Max ( review ) and ZTE Blade A2 Plus, the latter is the weakest. The A2 Plus also has the smallest battery of the lot, but in real world terms, neither really matters. The device has a massive 5000 mAh battery that lasts just over 11 hours on PC Mark’s Work 2.0 battery test. This test simulates real world performance by editing documents, playing videos, browsing etc. and keeping the screen turned on. It isn’t the perfect test of real world battery life, but we’ve found it to be closer than most other battery tests out there. As far as big battery phones go, this is 45% lower than the Lenovo P2 and just about 10% lower than the Asus Zenfone 3s Max.. In practice, this translates to a day’s worth of battery life, meaning you can easily get 24 hours per charge. I streamed three episodes of Two And a Half Men with only 4% battery on the device, while gaming for half an hour takes about 4% battery too. That’s with the display turned to auto in a well lit room.. The Blade A2 Plus runs on the MediaTek MT6750 SoC, clocked at 1.5GHz. It is the same chipset that Asus used for its Zenfone 3s Max. However, this one doesn’t run on Android Nougat and it has MiFavor 3.5 UI, instead of ZenUI.. The performance, though, remains the same. The A2 Plus seems to focus too much at preserving battery life. It turns off almost all of its cores whenever it gets a chance. The first core keeps running at about 1 GHz on an average, while the other cores are shut off whenever the system is close to idle.. CPU1 remains between 1-1.5GHz most of the time, while others are easily shut off. While that is still acceptable, the real problem is in how much resources MiFavor UI itself uses. Trepn Analyser shows 30-60% CPU load when the system idle. That’s quite a lot on a phone that barely has any user-installed apps. It means in the long run, your phone is more likely to get slow as you keep downloading more apps.. I even saw some lags when loading Asphalt 8 and transitions on the game’s menus are stuttery. Similarly, Amazing Spiderman 2 showed some lags as well, much like what we saw on the Zenfone 3s Max earlier. It also tends to heat up quite easily, to about 39 degrees over 10 minutes of gaming, which leads the system to throttle.. In essence, the ZTE Blade A2 Plus isn’t a good device as far as performance is concerned. Choosing a Snapdragon 625 over the MT6750 would have been a better idea.. Perhaps the best thing about the Blade A2 Plus is its 5.5 inch 1080p display. You get 401 ppi pixel density, which is definitely good enough and while I can’t describe the colours are “popping” or “pleasant”, they are decently balanced. Black levels aren’t particularly high, but acceptable, and the contrast ratio is reasonable too. You get the drift here, don’t you? The display on the ZTE Blade A2 Plus is reasonable, but nothing worth writing home about. Sunlight visibility is fine, with maximum luminance levels of 575 Lux.. The same can be said about the UI. MiFavor UI, to me, looks quite primitive. The big icons seem childish and in need of refinement. The UI is colourful, which some may like, and changes are mostly in the looks. ZTE has added a Super Key option, which allows you to use the fingerprint sensor for particular tasks. You can press it once for a screenshot, double tap to take a photo when the camera is open, and long press to turn on the flashlight.. It also has a bunch of gesture recognition options you can choose from. You can double tap to unlock, of course, but also draw gestures to skip music tracks etc. It’s a novel gimmick, but one that I mostly didn’t need to use. There are indeed quite a few gestures, but truth be told, I don’t find them making things better for me. Although, they surely don’t make things worse either.. Overall, ZTE’s display and UI are pedestrian, with nothing really special about them. They’re functional aspects of the device, but sadly, the only two things that you won’t always complain about.. That leaves us with the camera, which is perhaps the weakest element of this smartphone. The ZTE Blade A2 Plus has a 13MP camera on the back, and it looks and feels like a two-year old camera. The Blade series may be aimed at a simpler and more budget conscious buyer, but the market’s just too advanced for this right now.. The camera struggles to focus very often, and is slow even when it does. When shooting under low light, you see the green signal telling you that the camera has focused, whereas the viewfinder still shows a blurry image. The app itself looks primitive too. Given ZTE’s excellent Nubia UI, it is surprising that it has done such a lacklustre job with this one.. In terms of image quality, the Blade A2 Plus remains reasonably true to source in terms of colours, losing white balance on shots taken indoors and in low light. You’ll find image quality to be average and often lacking focus. Low light shots lose focus almost always. It doesn’t do well with details, producing noise in almost all light conditions - lower the light, higher the noise, and lesser the details.. The mono speaker at the bottom of the Blade A2 Plus wouldn't qualify as incredible, but it works for watching videos or movies in a silent room. I actually spent hours watching videos on the phone, without any issues. Last but not the least, the phone’s design is pretty much the same you’ve seen on Xiaomi’s Redmi Note series and many others. However, ZTE’s device has a square camera module on the back, with a horizontal dual-LED flash below it and a square fingerprint sensor placed parallelly below it.. The front bezels are slim enough, while there’s a round capacitive home button that lights up when you use it. I’m not a big fan of the back and recent button on either side of it, though. They’re just dots, with no depiction of what does what. It takes some getting used to. Moreover, the recents button actually brings up a wallpaper changing tool, instead of recent apps. For this you’ll need to long press the button. I'm actually not fond of this particular features, since you can bring up the wallpapers menu simply by swiping up on any home screen.. The front part is made of glossy plastic, which again feels old, and you’ll see the front camera, sensor hub and earpiece above the display. Personally, I’m not a big fan of how big the plastic strips above and bottom the display are, either. Given how much space the sensors, camera and buttons take, we’ve seen these being smaller, making the phone itself more compact.. The ZTE Blade A2 Plus feels big and at 189 grams, it’s somewhat unwieldy. It’s definitely not suited to single handed usage, but I doubt ZTE was going for that any way.. Overall, the design, like most other things about this smartphone, is pedestrian.. If you’ve read all of the above, you’ll gather that the ZTE Blade A2 Plus is not the phone I’d recommend. Its battery life is indeed impressive, but both the Lenovo P2 and Asus Zenfone 3s Max can do better. 11,999, you'll get a much more balanced smartphone in the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. The Lenovo Z2 Plus may be more expensive than this one, but if it's battery life you care about, that phone makes much more sense. The Blade A2 Plus is outperformed by all its competitors, and given that it will be available on Flipkart exclusively, it doesn't have the advantage of offline reach, either.. Honor 6X (Gold, 32GB).

ZTE Blade A2 Plus: Which one should you choose?. Published: Saturday, February 4, 2017, 8:00 [IST]. The battle of budget smartphones is getting way fiercer with each passing day. Every week, one or the other Chinese vendor introduces a new budget phone, and for the most part, all of them pack competitive hardware. What’s even worse is the fact that most of these phones are priced so closely that users get quite confused deciding which one to choose let alone buying one.. Wondering where this is going towards? Well, allow us to explain. In the past couple of weeks, okay forget about the last two weeks, today itself, there were a couple of smartphone launches — the ZTE Blade A2 Plus ( review ) and the Oppo A57. Again, both of them have similar specs and are priced very closely.. Also Read: ZTE Blade A2 Plus launched in India at Rs. 11,999, sale debuts on February 6. In the similar price range, you have the ever-reliable Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 ( review ). And there’s Huawei’s Honor 6X and a bunch of other phones. Now, that’s so-many-options and it’s only obvious to be puzzled.. But, fret not! We got you covered. Here’s a comparison between the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, ZTE Blade A2 Plus, and the Oppo A57.. Aesthetically speaking, all the three smartphones look nothing short of a premium handset for the asking price. However, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (especially the Black color variant) and the ZTE Blade A2 Plus are slightly ahead in the race. Also, both these phones feel sturdy in hand and should last long if used carefully.. While the Redmi Note 4 and ZTE Blade A2 Plus use a 5.5-inch display, the Oppo A57 uses a 5.2-inch display. Again, Xiaomi’s and ZTE’s offerings come with a Full HD resolution display. On the other hand, the A57 offers only a HD display. All the three phones have a 2.5D curved glass atop.. On-the-whole we found the display on Redmi Note 4 to be the best among the three. In fact, it is one of the best display you can find in the category. And that itself is a huge compliment for the device.. Among all the three smartphones, the Redmi Note 4 offers the best specifications for the asking price. In case you are unaware, click on this link to get a clear idea of the specifications of the device and how they stack against each other.. Let's get this straight out of the way, we have reached a point where most of the phones these days offer pretty decent performance for what they are worth. It is all about your preferences now. Choose whichever the brand you are the most comfortable with.. Having said that, there are a few things you should be aware of. For example, the camera performance on the ZTE Blade A2 Plus is not great while on the other hand, the Redmi Note 4’s camera is pretty decent. For a detailed information, you can read the individual reviews of both the smartphones linked above.. So, as mentioned earlier, it entirely depends on your preferences. If you need a good selfie camera and don’t mind spending a little more, the Oppo A57 is what you should be looking at.. If premium looks, durable body, stellar battery life, and a decent camera are exactly the things you are looking for the ZTE Blade A2 Plus should be a good bargain.. Having said that, on a whole the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 outperforms both of the above phones in almost all the aspects and we wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it whatsoever..

Additional phone controls via fingerprint sensor. Blade A2 Plus smartphone last month. The phone comes with a massive 5000mAh battery. Is the 5000mAh battery enough reason to buy this phone? Let us see if this budget smartphone is worth the price tag in this detailed review.. Similar to a number of phones out there, ZTE Blade A2 Plus also sports a unibody metal design and brings nothing new to the table. However, it does have solid build and feels quiet sturdy to hold. It has large bezels on top and bottom.. There is an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, earpiece and proximity sensor. The phone sports a 5.5-inch 1080p 2.5D curved glass display which is good but the sunlight visibility is average. The display is decent for watching videos and gaming.. A round capacitive home button is present below the display on the bezel while the back button is on the left and multi-tasking button on the right.. The micro USB port is present at the bottom with loudspeaker grills. Volume rockers and power button are situated on the right while the left side houses the SIM card tray. Finally, the 3.5mm audio jack is present on the top.. It is heavy and feels bulky due. Moving on to the back, the phone has a. fingerprint sensor below the camera module and LED flash. The ZTE branding is present in the middle.. The phone has a 13MP rear camera with dual-tone LED Flash, PDAF. The camera quality is just average. Macro images came out good while low light ones had lot of noise. The auto focus is also slow. Coming to the camera UI you have the usual settings HDR mode, picture-in-picture mode, panorama and so on. There is a gesture feature that lets you take a photo by making the ‘peace’ sign but it did not work most of the time during our testing period. The 8MP front camera is decent for selfies but mainly when there is good lighting.. Check out the camera samples below. (Click on the images for full resolution quality ). Even though the spec sheet says that it can. record video at 1080p resolution, the stock camera can record only at 720p HD resolution. The phone runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Mi Favour 3.5 on top. I personally felt the UI is very childish and unattractive especially because of the big app icons. There is no app drawer on the phone and all the apps are front and center.. The notification panel has usual shortcuts for WiFi, SIM setting, location and so on. You can add widgets as well to the screen. The phone comes bundled with apps like AccuWeather, Calculator, Clean Master, Family Mode, Private Space, Super Key, Gesture Motion and UC Browser. It also comes with usual set of Google apps.. It has 4GB RAM out of which there is 2.3GB usable RAM, out of which 1.7GB is free when the default apps are running in the background. Out of 32GB internal storage you get 24GB of usable space.. The music player is standard and has equalizer. FM radio lets you record music and you can save multiple radio stations.. The fingerprint sensor which also doubles up as a clickable button is present at the back below the rear camera. It is just not very fast but just does the job for you. You can click on it to take screenshots. The fingerprint addition process is simple and you can add up to 5 fingerprints.. It even offers functions like taking a photo. by tapping the fingerprint reader, answering calls. Swiping down on the fingerprint sensor you can unfold the notification drawer and swipe up to fold it. You can swipe up on the fingerprint sensor to check recent apps. Finally, using the fingerprint sensor you can launch the gallery and swipe left or right to view pictures.. The phone comes with hybrid Dual SIM card slot that can house nano + nano / microSD card. The primary SIM supports 4G while the secondary SIM slot supports only 3G. Call and audio quality is decent while playing music and calling. Connectivity options on the phones include 4G VoLTE, WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS.. 1.5 GHz Octa-Core MediaTek MT6750T 64-bit processor with Mali T860 GPU. It offers a decent performance that is lag free. The 4GB RAM is good for performance, gaming and multi tasking. However, the phone got heated from about 20-25 minutes of usage. It scored 44846 in AnTuTu benchmark.. It scored 2786 points in Vellamo Browser benchmark.. It scored 1117 points in Vellamo Metal benchmark.. It scored 9388 points in 3D Mark Ice Strom benchmark.. The phone has a 5000mAh battery that easily lasts for two days with moderate to high usage. It also comes with a Power Manager setting that has a Ultra Power saving mode which when enabled turns off all features like mobile data, Bluetooth, GPS. Only the basic functions like calls, SMS and other run in the background. The phone also displays high power consumption apps in the status bar.. The phone achieved one charge rating of 15 hours and 18 minutes which is not the best considering the phone has a 5000mAh battery. Check out our the complete set of battery test results here .. The ZTE Blade A2 Plus is an average phone that fails to impress in terms of camera performance. The UI on the device is definitely not the best we have seen on phones and needs a major revamp. Although the price tag of Rs. 11,999 looks decent, the phone falls short to justify it. However, one area where the Blade A2 Plus scores is the battery performance and I am not sure how many customers would go for the device only because of the large 5000mAh battery. It is available exclusively from Flipkart. Check out this list if you are looking for smartphones with long battery life..
