Please make sure that you are posting in the form of a question.. Don't see what you're looking for?. There was a problem completing your request. Please try your search again later.. An unlocked phone is a device that is not bound to any carrier or plan. It allows you to choose your phone first and your carrier second. Upon selecting a plan, simply insert the carrier's SIM card into the phone and you're ready to go. If you decide you want to change carriers down the road or want to take an international trip, it's as simple as replacing your existing SIM card with a new SIM and activating your new plan.. What are the benefits of an unlocked phone?. Freedom: Choose the carrier with the best service or price. If you find a better deal later, you have the ability to change to a different carrier.. Travel: Take your phone internationally and use the carrier of your choice. It's as easy as inserting an active SIM card.. Selection: Choose the phone with the features you want, whether or not your carrier sells it, and get more service options without a contract.. How do I set up my unlocked phone?. The first thing you’ll need is a SIM card for your desired carrier. When activated, the SIM card will let your phone connect to your carrier’s network. If you decide to upgrade to a newer unlocked phone in the future, you can easily remove the SIM card from your old phone and put it in your new phone—just make sure you get the right size of SIM card (nano, micro, or standard) for your phone. If you want to use your phone while traveling internationally, you can easily buy a SIM card for a carrier that operates where you’re traveling. As long as it’s activated, you can just swap SIM cards when you arrive at your destination.. 6.7 x 6.7 x 1.46 in. 0.39 x 3.15 x 6.27 in. 2.83 x 0.31 x 5.79 in. 1.4 x 5.8 x 6.5 in. 0.34 x 2.72 x 5.43 in. 0.4 x 6.27 x 3.27 in.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 1.0 out of 5 stars This phone was great.. Size: H790 32GB | Color: 32GB Carbon Black | Verified Purchase. It's completely died on me and it's only a little over a year old. It went into a continuous reboot and then died. I've searched forums and unfortunately have found that this is a known issue. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Great design, HORRIBLE reliability. Size: H790 32GB | Color: 32GB Carbon Black | Verified Purchase. Let me start off saying first of all that I LOVE THIS PHONE. It is without a doubt my favorite phone I have ever owned, UNTIL today. Only 9 months from purchase, the phone has now entered what is widely known as the dreaded "bootloop". As I found out the hard way, this is a chronic issue with the Nexus 5X. The phone automatically restarts itself, attempts to boot, fails, attempts to boot, fails, etc in an endless cycle. It is now completely inoperable and worth nothing more than a paperweight. LG is willing to "repair" the phone, but it leaves me without a cell for 2+ weeks, and there is no guarantee the problem will not return. I was a lucky one considering I was within the 1 year warranty, but if it happens to you outside your warranty, you'll be out of luck. As great as the phone is functionally, the reliability is NOT worth the risk, so therefore I cannot recommend this phone. Do not gamble your money on this thing!. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Do not buy - This phone will fail with a boot loop issue, at some time.. Size: H790 32GB | Color: 32GB Carbon Black | Verified Purchase. It appears to be when, not if, the Nexus 5x will fail and boot loop. had the phone for 16 months. Was working fine, went to pull up google Chrome. Phone rebooted and continued to reboot after clearing cache, wiping phone, and even freezing. I loved the concept of this phone of being pure Android and the phone worked and functioned great while it lasted, but it just didn't. Until I replace this phone (NOT with an LG/Nexus with the boot loop issues) I am using a phone that is four years old. Would NEVER buy the LG Nexus 5X Again.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great design, mediocre quality material, speedy UI.. Size: H790 32GB | Color: 32GB Ice Blue | Verified Purchase. This is second order for the LG Nexus 5X H790. The first being a 16G, which was previously reviewed. This is the 32G version, same model. I've had this a short while and although I'm deaf, It has been a great moderate phone (moderate being relative). For me, the price I paid was expensive $299-399, but not as expensive as my Note Edge I'm still making payments on 1 1/2 years later ($800 through Tmo). The Nexus 5X started right up with 60% charged, more than enough to plug in the mini SIM and sign up with a free service. This phone suits my few needs--texting, a few Google apps and i'm good to go. I make a call to keep the service up to date but otherwise, this phone is super. I"ve got this as a back up phone, love the Ice Blue, got it really because the color was different and goes with the Aqua Blue T100HA 2-in-1 computer I bought on a sale (and with Amazon Credits). This phone immediately upgraded to Android 7.0 Nougat then weeks later another security update. Honestly, I can't see or tell a difference between Nougat and Marshmallow, which my Note Edge just received mid-summer. But, the interface and UI is smooth, there's no lag, startup is instant. Calls and texts show on the lock screen, which is smooth to unlock. Haven't tested the camera because I have the Note Edge, which takes really great photos already. With 32G on the phone, I can take a few pics and post on social media to my hearts content. Nothing I have on the phone is valuable, so I do not lock with the fingerprint scanner on the back. I can say that it is somewhat awkwardly placed, as my fingers wrap completely around to the other side. I practiced faking a fingerprint scan and almost dropped the phone. The build of the Nexus really does feel lightweight and somewhat cheap. I was a bit disappointed because I have an old Nokia 7380 that feels better quality than this LG. I've had LG phones before which had great quality, sturdy builds to them.. So this phone's cheap quality feel was surprising--especially with the expensive price tag (for us poor people who don't have thousands laying around in unused savings accounts). I do have an old leather sunglass sleeve I put the phone in for more scratch protection than anything else. I'm careful with the phone, protecting in my messenger bag, rather than shoving unprotected in my pocket with keys or coins.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Lasted 5 months then simply died.. Size: H790 32GB | Color: 32GB Carbon Black | Verified Purchase. 5 months of ownership and it just blacked out and croaked. This is the second nexus 5x that I have had that does this. Too bad, it's a good phone and I like all the google intergration but the build quality and reliability are horrible. No phone should last less than a year, let alone 5 months. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars bootloop nightmare :(. Size: H790 32GB | Color: 32GB Carbon Black | Verified Purchase. Until bootloop i was in love with my phone... I have bought it on march 2016. It was working well and quick. Yesterday it was suddenly frozen and start reboot permenantly. I have read and tried everything for troubleshooting and nothing works..It is under US warranty but i am not in US now. I saw that it was a common problem for LG phones and they declared a free repair in Korea. So why not in worldwide if it is their mistake??? Now i am using my 5-years old iphone 4s. It was a veery wrong decision to buy a LG phone. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Unplanned H791, but I like the phone so much. Size: H790 32GB | Color: 32GB Quartz White | Verified Purchase. excellent phone, nothing else to add other than to warn, if you are really into getting h790(the us version) you can't find it under $350, but you may be tricked by amazon to end up with h791 and india warranty regardless that it said us warranty, but for the price of $319 I can't complain. If you want to make sure to get us version you'll have to go with $399 on google which is a lot for this phone. The 2GB RAM works for me fine, but I wouldn't pay $399 for it, considering that most phones in price range of >$399,$400 are with 3GB RAM. I would complain to amazon, but I discovered the india issue few hours ago(after all the customizing etc) hence why I'm posting a review otherwise I would have probably waited for months or maybe never. H791 DOES work with T-mobile, and it DOES support 3G/4G LTE (not sure about the new bands, 12,14 etc) to see if you have h791 or h790 (sadly nowhere on box did it say it, but in small piece on the carton with the sim extraction, which somehow I missed for two days) check the back of the carton where the sim extraction pin thingy comes in, or go to about phone and tap regulatory details and you'll see whether you got the wrong warranty or the whole thing, although unexpected earbuds should be a dead giveaway.

He was somewhat disappointed but fine with that. 5.0 out of 5 stars Arrived 2 days before expected!. Worst phone i have owned, all major aspects are so so bad minus the camera.. 1.0 out of 5 stars So SO bad.

Do not buy it!. 1.0 out of 5 stars Bootloop hell! Do not buy it!. It was fine until it got stuck in a boot loop. Never stellar but it mostly was fine. 2.0 out of 5 stars Boot loop. This phone died after 18 months. It turned off suddenly and will not power back on. This phone model should have been recalled - apparently this is a very common problem.. 1.0 out of 5 stars This phone model should be recalled - buy a different phone. Love this phone, but they only last about a year. While it works, it's fast, easy to use, with a good camera and great battery life. 2.0 out of 5 stars Great design, poor life expectancy. Great item and the price is awesome. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Do not buy this phone nexus 5x.

The Nexus 5X is a lot like the Nexus 5, but in all the ways that aren't so good.. For a lot of Nexus fans, the original LG Nexus 5 is like a folk hero. The stories we tell after the phone has been replaced and shelved with the other mobile relics are about this amazing superphone that changed the industry with its impressive specs and remarkably low price tag.. And as is often the case with folk heroes, reality is a little different. The Nexus 5 was a decent phone, but the price tag was the most interesting thing about it.. Since the launch of the original Nexus 5, the $300 to $400 price range has exploded with a number of compelling options. Google took a year off from this space with the launch of the Nexus 6, but this year we've got two Nexus phones, and Google clearly has aimed one of them at that sweet price point. The Nexus 5X is Google and LG working together to create a successor to one of the most popular Nexus phones we've ever seen, with the latest version of Android powering this $380 nostalgia machine. The big question is whether these two companies were able to push this new Nexus 5 from mediocre to exceptional to compete in the market they helped create.. I (Russell Holly) have been using the Nexus 5X for 10 days, split evenly between Google's Fi network and Verizon Wireless in Baltimore and Hurst, Texas. This Nexus 5X, which was provided by Google, is running build MDB08G, which is Android 6.0 for those who don't speak fluent build number.. During most of the review period, a Moto 360 2015 was paired to the phone.. Much like its predecessor, the Nexus 5X is one of the most comfortable phones to use with one hand to have been released this year. Despite being slightly wider and taller than the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge, the Nexus 5X weighs less and doesn't require a case to avoid a slippery glass back. The impressively light construction and soft touch coating on the back give the phone a great overall feel. It's not quite a grippy or as comfortable to hold as the original Nexus 5, but it's close enough that fans of this design will appreciate the way the phone feels in the hand.. Taking it out of the box the first time brought back memories of phones that shipped with the battery removed (a rarity these days), and compared to just about every other major smartphone release this year the Nexus 5X weighs noticeably less. There's no denying how plastic the phone feels, right down to the lack of ceramic volume and power buttons, but it doesn't quite cross the line into cheap-feeling. The phone doesn't give or flex when pressure is applied, but our back cover already has some noticeable scuffs and scratches from day to day use, as well as a dent in the speaker grille. It's solid, but it's hard to escape how disposable this phone feels due to its weight and build.. The front of the Nexus 5X couldn't be more plain, which is great. No logos, no buttons, just a pair of speaker grills, a camera, and a sheet of Gorilla Glass 3. The plastic bezel just barely climbs over the glass to protect those of us who put our phones face-down, but otherwise it's a flat black slab until you wake the display. Despite the pair of speaker grills, sound will only come out of the bottom when playing music or talking with speakerphone on. The speaker in the top grill is only for calls, and like the bottom speaker is neither particularly loud nor particularly high quality. They will get the job done, but LG won't be winning any audio quality awards from the speaker or the headphone jack on this phone. (We'd put it on part with the Galaxy S6, which is not that much of a good thing.). 5.2 inches FHD (1920x1080) LCD at 423 ppi Corning Gorilla Glass 3 Fingerprint- and smudge-resistant oleophobic coating. 12.3MP 1.55 μm pixels f/2.0 aperture IR laser-assisted autofocus 4K (30fps) video capture 120 fps slow motion video capture Broad-spectrum CRI-90 dual flash. 5MP 1.4 μm pixels f/2.2 aperture. Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 Processor, 1.8GHz hexa-core 64-bit Adreno 418 GPU. RAM: 2GB LPDDR3 Internal storage: 16GB or 32GB. 147.0 x 72.6 x 7.9 mm. Fingerprint sensor Sensor Hub Accelerometer Gyroscope Barometer Proximity sensor Ambient light sensor Hall sensor Android Context Hub. Micro USB Type-C 3.5 mm audio jack Single Nano SIM slot. LG also won't be winning any display quality awards, which is to be expected with a mid-range phone. The 1080p LCD display in the Nexus 5X gets the job done indoors, but it's borderline unusable the moment you step into the sun. It's a typical low-end LCD screen, which is a little frustrating after having used the exceptional LCD panel in the Moto X Pure Edition. It's a mediocre experience, but not an altogether bad one.. It probably wouldn't have killed Google or LG to put wireless charging in this phone.. Outside of the camera bump and the fingerprint ring, the back of the Nexus 5X is equally plain. The Nexus logo stands out more on the white version than the mint or black versions, and thankfully it's a part of the casing so you won't have to worry about letters falling out over time. The fingerprint ring is raised just enough that you'll quickly notice it when blindly looking for it with your finger, but not enough to feel out of place when holding the phone after it has been unlocked. This is especially true if your find yourself resting your finger on the bottom of the camera bump, which is high enough on the phone that you can lay the Nexus 5X on its back and use it without a lot of rocking around.. The USB-C and 3.5mm ports on the bottom of the Nexus 5X are placed well for anyone holding the phone horizontally, and like most of the examples we've seen so far the design of the USB-C port limits the kind of unnecessary wiggling that could damage the internal stem if you were to drop the phone while it was connected. You're unlikely to be in a position to drop the Nexus 5X while it is connected to the included power cord anyway, since it's noticeably shorter than most cables we get from other phones, and because it's a C-C cable —. that is both ends are the new reversible USB-C. So if you want to plug it into a computer or a different charger, you'll need an A-C cable.. There's a lot to like about the Nexus 5X. While it's ridiculous to think of something with a 5.2-inch display as a "small" phone, that's basically what the Nexus 5X is. It's a small, inexpensive phone running the purest form of Android. It probably wouldn't have killed Google or LG to put wireless charging in this phone or include a second cable in the box like Huawei did with the Nexus 6P, but out of the box this experience isn't bad.. Pure google, for better or worse. Like every Nexus before it, the 5X is rocking Google's Android, and this year it's all about Marshmallow. Dozens of new animations, native support for lots of new hardware, and some basic changes to how things like notifications work. Android 6.0 brings a lot of polish to the massive overhaul that was Android 5.0, and that means there's a lot of little things to appreciate. Perhaps more important, the OS itself feels a lot more complete.. Read More: Our Android 6.0 Marshmallow Review!. Despite being Google's vision for Android, the Nexus lineup this year doesn't go out of its way to support every new feature Google built. Adoptable Storage, for example, doesn't mean there's going to be a microSD slot for you to bump your maximum capacity. The Nexus 5X does support things like "OK Google" when the screen is off, Ambient Display for when you want to glance down at your phone and see what is going on, and a clever camera launch shortcut you can activate by double tapping the power button. There are a lot of clever ideas here that really make the Android as a whole feel more aware and capable.. Unfortunately, none of them work particularly well on the Nexus 5X.. The "OK Google" command when the display is off works fairly well when the 5X hasn't entered Doze mode, but it's nowhere near as good at waking up from a distance as the Huawei Nexus 6P or the Moto X Pure Edition. The same goes for Ambient Display. occasionally flashing notifications on the screen as it sleeps —. which works about half of the time it works on the Nexus 6P when sat side by side with identical apps and settings. It feels like the new Sensor Hub Google put in these new Nexus phones hasn't been tuned quite as well as the Huawei version, so it's entirely possible this experience will improve over time. For now, it's almost easier to turn these features off.. Double-tapping the power button to launch the camera is not a Sensor Hub feature, so there's no excuse here. The implementation here is just plain broken. When you double tap the power button with the screen off, there's around a 15 percent failure rate on the 5X (and only the 5X). While some of that can be chalked up to user error, watching the display freak out and take 20 seconds to actually launch the camera is not an example of failing to actually press the power button twice. If you try this shortcut while the display is on and the phone is unlocked, the screen re-locks because you just pressed the power button and pulls you out of your current workflow. You can't unlock the phone from the camera, so you have to press the home button and unlock the phone before you can do anything with the picture you just captured. This experience is just plain bad, but if Google can fix it this shortcut could be great.. Despite phones already landing on doorsteps, the software doesn't feel fully baked.. The rest of the experience is Android as you'd experience it on any other Nexus phone. The grid for Google's launcher is five rows and five columns now, which means you can fit more on your home screen but also means icons look a little tiny compared to some of the other phones using Now Launcher. This is the one place in the interface you notice the UI isn't quite as nice as it is on the Nexus 6P, and it's only something you're going to notice if you're holding the two phones side by side.. Software on the LG Nexus 5X feels a lot like the software on the original Nexus 5, which is to say despite phones already landing on doorsteps the software doesn't feel fully baked. There are a lot of things that work really well, and look amazing thanks to Marshmallow's new animations, but there's clearly still work to be done here.. Truly exceptional, most of the time. There is a lot to love about Google's new camera, both with the sensor and with the app driving it. We've head a solid year of companies promising solid cameras in smartphones and actually delivering, but the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P are something special. The software is dead simple, the pictures you get are fantastic, and the amount of work you put in to get the shot is basically nonexistent. Google has finally delivered a Nexus phone with a good camera, and they were so excited about it they did it twice.. The 12.3-megapixel sensor on the back of the Nexus 5X captures a fantastic amount of color and a respectable level of detail, and impressively it does so via autofocus a vast majority of the time. The camera doesn't handle macro shots particularly well without a tap to focus, but that is true of most smartphone cameras so it's not a big deal. A quick swipe on the camera app flips to video mode, where you can grab 120FPS slow motion or 4K video with little effort. With both video modes, the lack of OIS didn't cause any noticeable problems. 4K video would obviously be better with OIS, but what you get out of this camera is more than good enough for most folks.. Where this camera truly stands out is low-light capture, and in this regard Google has done an incredible job. This is by far the best low-light camera we've used this year, and it works exactly the way Google said it would. This camera pulls light in from basically nothing, and routinely gets you the shot you want.. Unfortunately, on the Nexus 5X the camera app isn't quite as fluid and snappy as it should be. The camera app regularly hands when flipping from still photos to video, and when capturing photos with HDR+ enabled it can take anywhere from 2 to 8 seconds to fully process the photo you've captured. In some cases there's even a slight delay between the shutter button and actually capturing the image, which makes shooting a moving target a little complicated. This makes capturing multiple photos something of a drag as well if you have HDR+ on, and since it's set to auto out of the box there's a good chance you'll run into this at some point. It's an unfortunate trade off for that fantastic camera, but rather than it be a deal-breaker it's just something you need to keep in mind when using the camera.. It's weird to have both a Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P sitting in front of you, knowing one is noticeably faster and generally more capable, and yet feel compelled to reach for the Nexus 5X every time. LG has delivered a lightweight, snappy Nexus that flies through day to day tasks but is clearly limited in a handful of important ways. Nothing about the phone feels slow when opening apps and flipping between tasks most of the time, but occasionally having 2GB of RAM means apps need to re-cache when you switch to them. This is most noticeable when using just about any app after using the camera app, which offers its own usability challenges as we've pointed out.. Using the Nexus 5X is fantastic if you're a fan of smaller, lighter phones. It all but disappears in your pocket, and the soft-touch back makes walking around and using the phone with one hand a lot easier than most. It's light enough that a case adds noticeable bulk, and since the cases we've tried so far for the phone haven't been particularly great the Nexus 5X has been naked for most of this review. Which is good, it's good that the phone doesn't feel like it needs to be in a case to survive day to day use. That's not something we can say about most phones right now, so it's worth making it clear this is a good thing.. This is roughly the same experience we get out of the LG G4 and Moto X Pure Edition, and it's happening with 300mAh less than either of those phones.. Nexus Imprint is the new gold standard for fingerprint scanning. You set it up with only six presses tot he sensor, and the unlock is easily as fast as the other high-end sensors right now. The placement is perfect, the execution is fantastic, and if Google can get developers to actually support Nexus Imprint for authentication in their apps this will become the most useful authentication system on any phone. It's a positive start, which is important since Google has taken a little while to implement this feature natively.. Battery is always one of the biggest questions when it comes to any phone, and with all the changes Google made to Android with the 6.0 release that focus specifically on battery there's an expectation to be met here. The Nexus 5X routinely went from 6 a.m. on a single change, with between 15 percent and 20 percent battery remaining. This is roughly the same experience we get out of the LG G4 and Moto X Pure Edition, and it's happening with 300mAh less than either of those phones. While I'm sure everyone would be happier with a 3,000mAh battery in this phone, knowing you can get through a full day with less is an impressive example of how much work Google put into Android for this release.. Despite the speakers being somewhat lacking on this phone, the microphones do a spectacular job capturing audio and filtering out background noise. The three microphone array on this phone is fairly standard, but it's implemented well whether you're speaking to someone else or you're just using your phone to capture a conversation to transcribe later.. Nexus 5X the bottom line. Should you buy it? Probably not. When it works, using the Nexus 5X is a lot of fun. If Google can reduce these failure points we've found in using the phone for the last week, the overall quality of this phone will be improved dramatically. If it feels like this gets said a lot about Nexus phones, that's because it does. Lots of folks remember the original Nexus 5 for what it was at the end of its lifespan — ignoring the camera, of course — but out of the box the experience was lacking.. Google has delivered a lot of great things with this new Nexus duo, but it couldn't be more clear that the Nexus 5X is the lesser of the two. It's a mediocre experience with some amazing high points, and when you balance that out against a $379 price point you're getting what you pay for. The $300 to $400 space is all about picking your high points and balancing them against the compromises made to reach that price, and Google delivered a fantastic camera and an exceptional fingerprint casing in an amazingly light package that stumbles every once in a while when you use it. It could be better, but it's already pretty good.. Google's Nexus 5X is $379 for the 16-gigabyte model, which you shouldn't buy because it's 2015 and 16GB base storage for a smartphone is unacceptable. (Let that rational part of your brain take over for a minute.). If you jump up to the 32GB Nexus 5X you're now paying $429, which is only $70 away from the 32GB Nexus 6P. If you haven't read our Nexus 6P review yet, you really should. It is in every way $70 better than the Nexus 5X, and your money would be better spent on an experience that will last you a while and be enjoyable the whole time instead of hoping Google improves things over time. Even if they do, the Nexus 6P will still be a better way to spend your money.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

Google's Nexus 5X has the worst battery life of any phone we’ve used all year. There’s a lot to love about the Nexus 5X, but poor battery life bars the affordable phone from our recommended list..

There’s a lot to love about the Nexus 5X, but poor battery life bars the affordable phone from our recommended list.. Battery lasts less than a day. Interface becomes laggy after several weeks use. A fabulous fingerprint and payment sensor. Fast charging, but damn poor battery life. Android 6 Marshmallow is fluffy and delicious. Battery lasts less than a day. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. It’s two years old, but the Nexus 5 is still one of our favorite Android phones. Priced at $350, it offered premium features at a budget price. We aren’t sure why it took Google so long, but its successor, the Nexus 5X, is finally here .. And like all decent sequels, it’s better than the original in almost every way – except in the two ways that matter most: price and battery life.. Updated on 11-18-2015 by Jeffrey Van Camp: I updated this review after using the Nexus 5X as my daily phone for several more weeks. Our early reports of poor battery life were definitely substantiated by further use, and we’ve experienced some troubling interface lag lately.. Plastic has fallen out of favor these days, as phones try hard to compete with the aluminum iPhone, but there’s nothing particularly wrong with it. The Nexus 5X isn’t the phone you’ll buy if you’re splurging or just won the lottery, and its construction is proudly plastic. With that come two big benefits: it’s lightweight and it might survive a fall without shattering.. Maybe is always the key word when dealing with a falling phone, however. The durable Gorilla Glass 3 5.2-inch screen is a step up from previous screen glass, and we like that the sides of the Nexus 5X rise slightly higher than the screen, forming a tiny lip of ½ a mm or so. It seems like nothing, but it takes a lot of pressure off the screen. — so long as your phone doesn’t hit the ground glass-first when you drop it.. This is also a smaller phone than all of the monster phablets you see these days. With a 5.2-inch screen, it’s taller and wider than the iPhone 6S, but about the same size as popular devices like the LG G4. The relatively small size makes the 5X easy to hold and use with one hand. The slight curve to the back of the phone and thin profile also help it sit comfortably in your palm, as does the comfy placement of the power and volume buttons on the upper right side.. The phone’s rear camera sticks out a bit, but this is a common issue among many major phones in 2015, including the iPhone 6S.. Listening to music on the speaker is about as fun as it is on most every smartphone outside of the HTC One M series. It’s a front-facing speaker, but sound seems to vibrate out the back as well. It sounds okay, but tinny and shallow, like most phones.. Speakers aside, there are two features that really set the design of the Nexus 5X (and it’s big brother, the Nexus 6P) apart from the crowd: A USB Type-C charger and a fingerprint sensor on the back.. LG Nexus 5X Compared To. Yes, this is a phone with a working fingerprint sensor, and boy does it work nicely. Like the iPhone 6S and Galaxy S6, you just tap your finger on the sensor and it will unlock your phone or authorize an app. However, unlike those phones, the fingerprint reader, which Google has dubbed the Nexus Imprint, is on the back of the device. It’s placed exactly where your index finger might sit, about two thirds of the way up the back, right under the camera. You’ll know where it is by the ring of plastic around it.. Kudos goes to Google and LG for an amazing fingerprint and payment system that works.. Its speed is on par with the Galaxy S6 and iPhone 6S, but it does more than just authenticate your lock screen; with a light touch on the fingerprint sensor, you can completely wake up the phone from an idle (screen off) state. This is amazing, and makes the sensor far quicker and more useful than Apple or Samsung’s’ options. Add in Android Pay, which works precisely as simply and easily as Apple Pay (and in all the same locations), and you this may be the best fingerprint-enabled phone available today. The only downside to the location of the fingerprint sensor is that you can’t easily use it if your phone is on a table. But we’re okay with that since it’s much easier to use than competitors when you’re holding the phone.. Kudos to Google and LG for an amazing fingerprint and payment system that works.. We’re impressed with the new USB Type-C connector on the new Nexus 5X and 6P. Yes, it is a new type of charger, which means none of your old chargers will work, but it is a new standard that every phone will have in the next few years. It also has a couple clear benefits, in that it can be plugged in any way, just like the iPhone Lightning charger, and it charges very quickly – very quickly. Google claims you can get four hours of battery life out of a 10-minute charge. Sadly, it’s a feature you’ll need to use, because the Nexus 5X has atrocious battery life.. Many major standard-sized phones in 2015 have had disappointing battery life to a small degree, but the Nexus 5X is impressively poor. it has never made it through a day alive. Most smaller phones, like the iPhone or Galaxy S6, struggle compared to their larger phablet siblings, but you can end a full day – 7 a.m. – with about a 30-40 percent charge left, assuming moderate use. The Nexus 5X has yet to make it past dinner on days of moderate use. One day, it was unplugged at 8 a.m. and drained to 35 percent battery by 3 p.m. with a warning that it would die in about 4 hours. Over the course of several weeks, the longest we made it was a 7 a.m. and we had to give it a top up midday if we planned to go out after work.. Running out of battery before a day is up as soon as you buy a phone is not good. After a year of use, Nexus 5X owners will have to recharge at lunch time.. The larger Nexus 6P has not had this problem. The biggest battery drainer is the LCD screen, which seems to suck 20 percent of juice, followed by the Android OS. With a rather normal 2,700mAh battery, we’re especially sad about these results.. The Nexus 5X and 6P are the first phones to run Google’s newest version of Android, 6.0 Marshmallow. It will be 3-12 months before most phones get this OS, so if you want to stay up to date, Nexus phones are the way to go (along with the Moto X Pure Edition ). They also are the only phones that will get critical bug and security updates directly from Google, which puts them on the top of our list of recommendations where it relates to security.. We highly recommend you buy a new Nexus phone, just not this one.. There’s nothing particularly crazy or new about Android Marshmallow, but it’s simple and lovely to use. After a year of fancy new Galaxy phones, LG phones, and HTC devices with custom interfaces, it’s been a joy to use the fast, simple looking, and speedy default version of Android. Everything works here, and the phone is loaded with all of Google’s standard apps – nothing more and nothing less.. My favorite new feature is Google’s “Now on Tap.” No matter what app you’re using, just hold down on the Home button and a Google window will pop up from the bottom of the screen. It shows whatever you’re looking at, and gives you more options. So if you’re hunting for a hotel, it gives you links to call or see more about the hotel, as well as a list of other apps that could help you search. Click on another app, Yelp for instance, and it will deep-link into the hotel’s page inside that app.. Now on Tap has already saved us a lot of time finding directions. Previously, I would look up places in Yelp, copy the address, and paste it into Google Maps. Now, I just have to hold the Home button and press the Maps icon and bam, done. On Tap connects apps up in fantastic new ways at the time you need it most.. You can read about other Android Marshmallow features here , but I’d also like to point out a way Android is safer. Google now lets you add and remove permissions for apps. So if a game like Angry Birds says it “needs” to use your camera to operate, you can deny it. Hopefully this will lead to more transparency from app makers, who have been sucking our battery life and getting too cozy with our private information for too many years. Every time an app needs to use something like your contacts list, a camera, or the microphone, it has to ask. It’s a little annoying as a user, but the security gained from this transparency is huge.. The phone has slowed down and begun to show lag when using Google apps after a few weeks of use. This is somewhat troubling, and another reason why we would not recommend this particular device.. Even with the new lag, overall, it’s a joy to use Android Marshmallow. Sometimes we wish every big phone came with Google’s default OS. It’s speedy, simple, and a joy to operate.. Google is very proud of its Nexus 5X and 6P 12-megapixel-rear camera. In our first tests, it has gotten the job done, but hasn’t blown our socks off. We still prefer shots from the iPhone 6S, but the 5X has a camera at least marginally comparable to the best Android phones on the market, including the LG G4 , Galaxy S6 , HTC One M9 , and Xperia Z4. This is a step up for the Nexus brand, which has been known for especially poor cameras these past few years.. Lowlight photos came out all right, but many of our daylight photos didn’t capture the oranges and yellows of afternoon light as well as the iPhone 6S. The camera also took more than one still shot before it focused, leading to some blurriness. The phone has laser-assisted autofocus, but does struggle with focusing speed more than other LG phones like the G4. Another shot where light came in through a window looked almost pastel-like and blurry when zoomed in due to color filtering.. None of these issues are major, and the 5-megapixel front camera performed up to task as well as you’d expect. The Nexus 5X has competitive cameras, but hasn’t reached the top of the mountain yet.. However, the plain Android camera app looks outdated and too simplistic. That wide black bar where the camera button and gallery option sit takes up too much of the screen, so you can’t really see what you’re taking a picture of on the nice, big screen. There aren’t many options or settings either, which is annoying, especially when most Android phones offer manual modes now. It’s time to update the camera app, Google.. Oddly, Google has given the Nexus 5X a low price of about $380, but you’re going to want to spend an extra $50, to get the 32GB $430 version. Take a few photos, a few videos, download a few podcasts, install a few apps, and you will be out of space on your Nexus 5X. Even 32GB may fill up on you after a year or two, but you’ll have a little wiggle room, at least. We highly recommend that you do not buy the 16GB Nexus 5X under any circumstances.. Outside the storage issues, the rest of the 5X is pretty good under the hood. It runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor, which is a slight, but unnoticeable step down from the top-of-the-line Snapdragon 810, which is in the 6P. The screen is a 5.2-inch 1,920 x 1,080 pixel LCD display, which gets the job done, and the entire phone is powered by 2GB of RAM. NFC, a Nano SIM slot, an audio jack, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, and Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac 2×2 MIMO 2.4GHz and 5GHz are also included.. Connection-wise, the Nexus 5X is capable of connecting to most North American and worldwide 4G LTE standards. Full band support can be found here .. The Nexus 5X comes with a 1-year manufacturer’s warranty from Google. This is for damage that you don’t cause to the phone, like it just breaking down, the screen going dark, or the battery failing. If you drop the phone, break the screen, or dunk it in something like water, you are not protected.. You can optionally purchase Nexus Protect , which gives you an additional year of mechanical breakdown coverage and two full years of protection from accidents, which do include accidental drops or dunks. However, you’re limited to two incidents of accidental damage in that two-year period, and lost or stolen phones aren’t covered. Assuming your situation fits the criteria, Google will send you a replacement phone “as soon as the next business day after a claim is approved, and it doesn’t matter which wireless carrier you use. The plan costs $70 for Nexus 5X.. Up your game and the get the most out of your gear with the following extras, hand-picked by our editors:. Candyshell Grip Google Nexus 5x case ($35). Cable Matters USB 2.0 type C to type A cable ($12). Shure SE112-GR sound isolating earphones ($49). We thought we would adore the Nexus 5X, but so far, we do not recommend it. It is a perfectly good phone in most respects, but is plagued by especially poor battery life that does not last even one full day. Luckily, it has a fast USB Type-C charger, but you shouldn’t have to worry about your phone dying before you get home from work on the first day you own it. After a few weeks of continuous use, we’ve also experienced some interface and app lag with Android Marshmallow, which is troubling.. Instead of buying a Nexus 5X, opt for the Nexus 6P instead. It’s a bigger phone, but surprisingly holdable for a device with a 5.7-inch screen, it has all of the perks of owning a Google phone, and several benefits over the 5X. These include an additional GB of RAM, a faster Snapdragon 810 processor, a stunning 2,560 x 1,440 pixel AMOLED screen (blacks on an AMOLED screen are a sight to see), an upgraded 8-megapixel selfie camera, 1.5-day battery life, and it comes with 32GB of memory out of the box, with options for 64 and 128GB. The 6P starts at $500, which is more than the 32GB 5X ($430), but the difference is not enough to spend two years fearing for your phone’s battery life every time your phone isn’t tethered to a socket. Don’t like that phone? The newest Moto X. also runs a “Pure” version of Android and starts at $400 for 16GB or $450 for 32GB.. We highly recommend you buy a new Nexus phone, just not this one. The fingerprint sensor is amazing, getting security updates directly from Google is a huge benefit, and Android Marshmallow is sweet, but you should pay a little more and get the Nexus 6P ..

LG Nexus 5 - user opinions and reviews. after changing battery phone still feel new for me, very confortable and light, can't say that about other phones. Can't say goodbye to him 4 years old now with me. I got a battery off of amazon/ebay for under 50 bucks. My WiFi stopped working as well but surprisingly baking the motherboard wrapped in foil for 8 minutes @ 200 Celcius (approximately 400 Fahrenheit) and it actually fixed the WiFi issue!.
