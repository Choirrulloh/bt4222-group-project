What Is The Battery Life Like On The iPhone 5s?. The iPhone 5s has, on average, up to 10 hours of usage time. The iPhone 5s also has the capacity for up to 10.5 days of standby time when not in use. To get the most out of an iPhone 5s battery, turn off unnecessary app notifications and change display settings to use less power. It is also a good idea to keep an iPhone away from direct sunlight and heat, as overheating can ruin the battery.. What Improvements Does The iPhone 5s Camera Have?. The iPhone 5s 8 MP iSight camera features a variety of improvements from previous models, including a 15 percent larger sensor, bigger pixels, and a 5-element lens. The camera also boasts a slow-motion mode that has the ability to take 720p HD video at 100 frames per second.. What Are Some Tips For Cleaning The Screen On An iPhone 5s?. When cleaning the screen on an iPhone 5s, always use a soft and slightly damp lint-free cloth to gently brush grime and fingerprints away. Never use household cleaners, compressed air, abrasives, or window cleaning chemicals, as those can damage the screen and the case. To prevent moisture damage, spray water onto the cloth and not onto the iPhone. Wipe the screen in gentle, circular motions until clean.. And the 8 is nearly twice as good as the 5…. So you’re looking at an iPhone 5 page on eBay right now. Have you thought about the iPhone 8? The iPhone 8 series is a major upgrade in every way from the iPhone 5. From the energy-saving OLED screen that covers the whole front of the phone to the zippy processor, the iPhone 8 is a truly remarkable phone. Should you make the switch? Yes. It’s a spectacular upgrade, with specs that will futureproof you for more than a fortnight. Still looking for the perfect iPhone for you?

The Good The iPhone 5S delivers an improved camera, a nifty fingerprint sensor, and a next-gen CPU and motion-tracking chip. Apple throws in the iWork app suite for free. iOS 7 adds some nice step-ups, too, including AirDrop file transfers and the Android-like Control Center.. The Bad External design is identical to that of the iPhone 5, including a 4-inch screen that looks downright tiny next to Android competitors. For now, the fingerprint sensor only works with Apple apps. The 64-bit A7 processor and M7 motion-tracking chip don't have killer apps yet. iOS 7 differences are potentially jarring for longtime iPhone users.. The Bottom Line The iPhone 5S is not a required upgrade, but it's easily the fastest and most advanced Apple smartphone to date.. Close-up of fabric, coming right up. Infinity Blade III on 5S: impressive. Editors' note (March 21, 2016): Apple has discontinued the 2013 iPhone 5S reviewed here, and replaced it with the iPhone SE. The new model is basically a 5S body with the innards of the late 2015 iPhone 6S .. Editors' note (September 19, 2014): The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are now the flagship phones in Apple's 2014-2015 product line. However, in addition to the iPhone 5C , the iPhone 5S (reviewed here) will remain on sale at a reduced price. The 16GB model now sells in two configurations: 16GB ($99 with a typical 2-year contract in the US, $549 off contract; £459 in the UK; AU$749 in the Australia) and 32GB ($149 on contract, $599 off contract in the US; £499 in the UK; and AU$799 in Australia).. I'm tempted to call the iPhone 5S the iPhone 5P, for "potential." This is Apple's half-step year, a rebuilding year. It's telegraphed by the name itself: adding an "S" versus giving the phone a whole new name. The 5S introduces technologies that could transform the future of iOS as a computing platform, and maybe pave the way for future products in 2014. But it doesn't manifest these changes right off the bat. Its promises haven't come to fruition yet.. Last year's iPhone 5 was the best iPhone we'd ever seen. It met nearly all our wishes and expectations. It added tons of new features. What did Apple do this year as an encore? It added...a few new improvements. Enter the iPhone 5S, which along with the. mark the first time Apple's delivered two new iPhones in one year. But the 5C is really the iPhone 5 in colored plastic. There's really only one new iPhone, and that's the 5S.. We wanted a bigger screen , an improved camera, and better battery life. Apple gave us a fingerprint sensor, an improved camera, and a faster processor. Faster is better, especially when battery life doesn't suffer, but the 5S doesn't feel like a shocking new product.. Apple does this every other year with iPhones -- see the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4S. It's a common occurrence in iPads and MacBooks, too: take a familiar form, and repeat. But, in a phone landscape dominated by rapid change, it can feel frustrating, even for a product we loved just 12 months ago. Even iOS 7 , Apple's graphically overhauled operating system, feels different but not really all that shocking. Even the new colors -- gold and "space gray" -- are subtler than you realize.. That doesn't mean there aren't changes, but many of them seem like roadwork for the future; a cleverly ingenious under-the-home-button fingerprint sensor, a clearly better camera, majorly upgraded graphics, a motion-tracking M7 coprocessor, and a new A7 processor capable of 64-bit computing are a lot of under-the-hood tweaks. But, after a week of using the iPhone 5S, it's hard to find situations that currently take advantage of these features, except for the fingerprint sensor and camera.. Check back in two months; after new apps emerge, maybe the iPhone 5S will start seeming like a truly new iPhone. But, for now, it's more of refined improvement. The iPhone 5 has gotten better. How much better depends on how fast apps and services can take advantage of the features...or whether we'll be waiting until iOS 8 to see them truly take shape.. Editors' note: Updated September 30, 2013, with expanded M7 fitness-tracking section and hands-on with M7-compatible apps, an additional battery test, and observations on real-use battery after several weeks of use. We will continue to update this review in the coming days, based on subsequent testing. Ratings should be considered tentative, and may evolve as testing continues.. Design: Take the iPhone 5, and add gold (or 'space gray'). The iPhone 5 was a somewhat subtle but completely thorough redesign of the iPhone, from screen size to headphone placement. It introduced an aluminum frame, a thinner and lighter build, and came in two colors.. The 5S is a carbon copy, with some new color variations. You can get last year's white/silver color, or "space gray," which matches black glass and a darker gray anodized aluminum. But it's not like a prop from Liberace's home: it's mellow gold, more a champagne, or a light bronze. Paired with white glass on the back and front, you might have a hard time noticing the gold in the wild unless it was held in the sun. Of the three colors, I liked gray the best: the metal tones might do a better job hiding scratches, too, a problem I saw pop up on last year's all-black iPhone 5.. A year later, the iPhone 5's design still feels sleek and high-end in the 5S, great in the hand, and more compact than most competitor phones. But, it also has a smaller screen (4 inches) than most of its Android cousins. I love using a more compact phone, but competitors have found a way to make larger-screened 4.7-inch phones with excellent feel, like the Moto X , which has nearly edge-to-edge screen across its face. The iPhone 5S has a lot more bezel framing the display, and I couldn't help wondering if that screen couldn't be just a bit bigger.. A larger screen would have really helped this year: not because the competition has it, but because Apple's newest features and apps would put it to good use. I found editing and appreciating the improved photos and video recording, and even playing games, to be challenging; the better that graphics and camera quality get, the more you need a larger screen to appreciate them.. There's no 128GB iPhone this year; you'll have to once again pick between 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB, at the same $199/$299/$399 prices. In the US, Sprint, AT&T, and Verizon are the three carriers to offer the iPhone 5S under contract; T-Mobile sells the iPhone 5S in an unlocked, contract-free version that costs $649 for 16GB, $749 for 32GB, and $849 for 64GB.. All versions come with the same A7 processor.. Touch ID: The party-trick tech on the 5S. See that little home button down there? It doesn't have a square on it anymore. It's also flat and recessed, not concave. That's practically the only outward-facing indication the iPhone 5S offers to the world, but lurking under the button is the most interesting piece of iPhone tech in quite some time. Unfortunately, it doesn't do as much right now as I wish it could.. "Touch ID" is Apple's fingerprint sensor, a secret sauce of clever scanning technology that amounts to a home button that's now both capacitive and clickable. The fact it does both can be a little disorienting at first, but the clicking is what the home button normally does, while gently touching the sensor activates the fingerprint scan.. Apple's faster iPhone 5S features fingerprint scanner (pictures). Touch ID's simple round button works on a simple press, versus a "swipe" gesture on a lot of previous fingerprint readers. The scanning technology, when it registers your fingerprint, encourages you to press from a variety of angles, so your fingerprint can be read even on its side or on an edge. It's fast: a simple click on the button and the phone unlocks, the scan happening invisibly. Most people won't even know it scanned them, but try another finger and you'll see that it worked.. A few previous smartphones have added fingerprint sensors before, like the Motorola Atrix , but those were more awkward bars that needed finger-swiping. The Touch ID-enabled home button feels invisible; it works with a tap, can recognize your finger from many angles, and feels like it has less of a fail rate than fingerprint sensors I've used on laptops. It worked on all my fingers, and even my toe (I was curious).. Its only limitation, really, is how little Apple has employed Touch ID into the iPhone experience at the moment. Scanning your finger takes the place of entering a passcode in most instances, or entering a password every time you purchase something from the App Store or iTunes. But, that's all Touch ID does for now: it doesn't remember your other passwords on various cloud services, or link to your credit card, or pay for movie tickets via Fandango.. In fact, you'd better remember whatever passcode you used to lock your phone, because Touch ID isn't a pure replacement. If you restart your iPhone, or turn it off and on, or don't use it for 48 hours, it'll ask for your passcode again before allowing fingerprint recognition. That's potentially useful as an extra deterrent for would-be fingerprint thieves, but it proved a little quirky over a week of use. I never knew when the 5S might insist I enter my passcode again.. Worried about a kid pressing his finger down over and over and erasing your phone's memory? Never fear. Touch ID cleverly defaults to asking for a passcode after three fingerprint attempts, and after five bad tries, it requires it. Then you still have 10 passcode attempts before any "erase contents after 10 passcode failures" setting you've possibly enabled kicks in.. How much time does it save? A little, especially since this process skips the "swipe to unlock" gesture. You'll also save a few seconds over entering a passcode. But, in terms of convenience, I really only appreciated it during the day, in those little moments when I quickly needed to hop on my phone.. I have a bigger dream for Touch ID, of its fingerprint scan acting as a password replacement for third-party apps or even a way to make payments, or check in to flights. It could be a mobile wallet killer app, and a companion to Apple's somewhat dormant PassBook app that launched with iOS 6. But those extra features won't be coming anytime soon. Apple currently intends Touch ID and your fingerprint -- which gets encrypted as mathematical data, according to Apple, not an image -- to stay on the A7 chip of the iPhone 5S, out of reach of third-party apps or cloud services. That could be good for added security, but it means Touch ID isn't a magic remember-every-password savior or credit card replacement yet.. That being said, I expect Touch ID to make its way onto every Apple device: iPads next, and eventually Macs. Why not? It's easy to use.. Touch ID may be getting all the headlines lately, but the iPhone 5S' improved camera is probably its biggest selling point. Cameras are no longer afterthoughts on smartphones: they're becoming the most important feature, for many, as they slowly but surely replace point-and-shoot cameras.. If you're getting a new iPhone for its camera, get the 5S. A suite of new and useful upgrades help make the already-good iPhone 5 camera into something even better...but, in a landscape riddled with increasingly impressive phone cameras, the iPhone stands out a little less than before.. Unlike many megapixel-packing smartphones (41-megapixel Lumia 1020 , I'm looking at you), the iPhone 5S camera stays at 8 megapixels, the same on paper as last year and even the year before. The sensor, as Apple will proclaim, however, is 15 percent larger: the pixels are physically bigger (1.5 microns), even if there are the same number of them. The camera's aperture is larger (f/2.2). All of these elements add up to better low-light exposure.. Newer A7-driven processing also enables true burst-mode shooting: hold down the shutter button and you'll snag as many shots as you desire. The iPhone 5 could take multiple shots with quick taps, but the iPhone 5S can capture rapid-motion activities like sports events (or, in my household, random baby tricks). Instead of spamming your Camera Roll with identical-looking images, the new iOS 7 camera app cleverly bundles them in a subfolder, and even autopicks what it considers the best shots. This decision is based on image crispness and other factors; sometimes it's on the money, but I also saw it pick a blurry image of my 7-month-old over a sullen but crisp side profile. You can pick your own favorites easily, and delete the rest at the touch of a button.. I took a bunch of shots in a ton of conditions, from indoor photos in a zoo's reptile house to still-lifes of flowers and colorful kitchen accessories. Close-up photos show off pretty incredible detail and a shallower depth-of-field effect, which feels more "SLR-like." See this rug picture, for instance.. Kid photos in lower light conditions were less blurry when magnified. Blurriness is a common problem I've seen on many of my iPhone 5 photos taken in lower light that look good enough on-phone, but don't hold up quite as well via Apple TV on a 59-inch display. These 5S pictures looked a lot better, and more consistently so.. Apple credits this to a new image signal processor (ISP) on the iPhone 5S' A7 processor. It does result in quicker autofocus, faster snapshots, and less blur all around. Considering how shaky the average person's hand is when taking casual phone shots, it's a necessary improvement.. Apple has made a big change to the built-in LED flash, too, doubling its size and creating an intelligent "True Tone" flash that senses the photo environment and serves up the appropriate flash tone from separate white and amber LEDs.. It's a splashy endeavor, but the results do look significantly better, and warmer, than the iPhone 5's flash pics. I avoid flash on my smartphone whenever humanly possible, but this year's improvements may have changed my opinion.. The 1080p video recording also gains a little more digital stabilization, 3x digital zoom thanks to iOS 7, and there's a new Slo-Mo recording mode, which is separately toggled in the camera app. The iPhone records 720p video at 120 frames per second, and applies the slow-motion effect afterward, playing at 30 frames per second.. You can readjust the start and stop points of slow motion with your fingers, much like editing a video clip. It looks great, but the slowed-down footage retains the audio track. You could always edit over it in iMovie (which is a free app, now, anyway). This type of ultrafast recording could earn the iPhone 5S a spot on a skateboarder's helmet or a skydiver's gear in place of the popular GoPro camera.. Now, how different is all of this from competing high-end phones boasting better cameras? The iPhone 5S suffers on physical megapixel count, but its speed/quality ratio are hard to beat. Adding slow-motion recording is gimmicky but works really well, and the improved flash technology is nice to have. But, overall, it's the extra speed and hardware-software-processor integration on the iPhone 5S that produced the best results. The camera is really the iPhone 5S' biggest improvement and feature, even without added megapixels...but it doesn't feel like as dramatic a leap as last year's iPhone 5's camera.. A7 processor: A beast on paper. We're in a pretty great time for mobile phone processors. Much like laptops and PCs a few years ago, impressive year-over-year gains in speed are becoming the norm. The iPhone 5 was more than twice as fast as the iPhone 4S, and true to Apple's claims based on every benchmark we could find, the iPhone 5S and its new A7 processor seem at least twice as fast as the 5 and its A6.. Numbers are great, but what does speed really mean in a phone? Sometimes it's hard to appreciate. Boot times aren't all that much faster between the iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C, and iPhone 5 -- 26.3 seconds for the 5S, and 31.7 for the 5C (and anyway, how many times do we even boot our phones?). Games and applications load up quickly and play smoothly, but the iPhone 5 felt the same way last year, and the iPhone 5C still feels pretty fast for everyday phone tasks.. The types of games and applications that can really take advantage of the iPhone 5S and its faster, more graphics-rich A7 processor aren't here yet at the time of this review, but expect them soon. I'm just sensing, perhaps, that there will be a limit as to how much pop you'll truly notice on a 4-inch display.. Is the iPhone 5S faster than other phones like the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One ? Based on every benchmark we could throw at the 5S, the answer is yes. How much? That depends on the test. Linpack suggests that the iPhone 5S is a lot faster -- and about twice as fast as the iPhone 5C. Geekbench 3, which recently updated its app to allow for 64-bit testing, suggests a nearly 3x gain over the iPhone 5C's A6 processor.. The 64-bit computing potential of the iPhone 5S and its A7 chip is, at the moment, largely theoretical. It could pave the way to more computer-like experiences on our phones, or even a future merge between Mac OS X and iOS.. Apple's core apps on the 5S are 64-bit optimized, but I didn't anecdotally appreciate huge gains in most of them...except for the camera. It's hard to tell how the A7 will make the iPhone 5S better, even if you can sense the speed. The killer apps don't seem to be here yet.. I've been curious to try out more games that take advantage of the iPhone 5S and its clearly improved graphics capabilities. Infinity Blade III, demonstrated at Apple's event, is the first of the "5S-optimized" games that's now available. I played it through the first few levels.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

Color: Space Gray | Size: 16 GB. So I made the switch from using Android to the iPhone back in October, and I've been using the iPhone 6 for the past few months now and can give a detailed review on what it's like to switch over. Before this switch, I've used the Samsung Galaxy S2 (first smartphone ever!) and also the Nexus 4. Since I'm a tech enthusiast, I'm well versed and have played around with many other Android devices, including all the big names, Galaxy S5, HTC One M8 and M7, One Plus One, and so on. Here are my thoughts: Things that the iPhone does really well (both hardware and software-wise): 1. The behind the scene software for digitally capturing an image is definitely the strongest sell for the iPhone. Other than the S5 and Note 4, no smartphone really comes close to having the same kind of image quality (no matter the megapixels) compared to the iPhone. This was one of the reasons for me to switch over since I've started to dabble with photography and wanted a really good camera in my smartphone. (Side note, if you read a lot of tech blogs, there is a notion that in the near future our smartphones won't accurately describe our devices anymore since making a phone call is probably one of the least commonly used features on a smartphone when you look at any average user. Cameras, social media, emails all take a higher usage rate than making a call... really interesting, but anyway, back to the review). There have been maybe 2 or 3 times when my phone crashed and would have to be restarted, mostly due to playing some game that was not written very well for the iOS devices. On Android devices, I've experienced a lot more crashes, and that may be due to the fact that so many apps haven't figured out the best way to optimize the app for each individual phone due to the fragmentation problems or something else. Either way, I feel like the iOS environment and hardware is more reliable in my everyday use. Once you've used it, you won't go back. The S5 is not that close yet in terms of usability with their sensor. The one in the iPhone 6 works really well. I definitely have found myself using my phone more because of how easy it is to unlock and install apps. In general, you get way more control over how to use and how to integrate your apps on Android than iOS. But in iOS, it's really interesting that you can control the kind of notification that gets sent to your phone, background refresh, location requirement, and access to certain things like photos and camera. In Android, you can do all of this as well, but sometimes for a lot of apps you have to have root access. Double tap to bring down the row of apps. I can't believe no one has thought of this before. A lot of Android phones have gigantic screens, but no one has really figured out how to best get the users to interact with that. You can tap the home button twice on the iPhone to bring down the top few rows of the apps so that you can access them in one hand use. Here are the things that I miss on Android: 1. Full integration of almost any apps and control of default apps. I can set default apps on Android whereas Apple does not allow that. I can open up photos and upload them to Dropbox or any other app that I choose to, whereas Apple doesn't allow uploading to Dropbox via the Photos app (you have to open up Dropbox, then select upload and then go to Photos from there). In the mail app for Android, you can attach almost any file on the phone. You can't do that on Apple. You can't even attach a single file. You have to share a file as an email. So, forget about replying an email with an attachment. If you are a big dropbox user, you probably know and love Dropsync on Android (seriously, best 5 bucks spent on any app). You can have an app that syncs and download any material from Dropbox onto your Android and then sync it back up when changes are detected. Apple does NOT allow that (mainly because they don't allow background apps from accessing the hard drive, or something along those lines). So you have to download the file you are interested in manually from the Dropbox app. It just slows you down a lot, especially if you get to a part of a building where there is weak signal for wifi or cellular data. Why can't Apple make one button that clears all of your notifications? You have to individually close each app's own notification. I pretty much leave my notification screen untouched. Some other things that many already know: Google Now is way better/useful than Siri. Material design looks awesome! Way better widgets and the fact that you can have widgets!! Oh, and you can swipe right on the home screen on Android and that brings another screen from the left side... can't do that on iOS, the home page is set to be the left most one. Conclusion: Overall, I think the iPhone is a fine device to use and you probably won't regret investing in one. The customer service from Apple is top notch, even if their parts cost an arm and leg. I think that, and I hate to say this because it's going to sound like every blog writer out there, the choice really does come down to personal preference and what you use the phone for. So, I've broken down my recommendation based on user case scenarios: If you are user type... Workaholic, Students: Android will be the best option unless your company/job dictates that you use an iPhone. The integration with all the apps and the feature with dropbox is just so important to anyone who works on their phones and other mobile devices. I would either get a pure Google device (N5 or N6, I like smaller phones... so N5 is up there) or a Google Edition device, or the Moto X. Samsung and HTC are also good choices but updates may be slow. One Plus One is actually pretty cool. They are not the best when it comes to customer service since they're a small company filling huge demand, but from my experience, the device is solid and definitely a work horse. Unfortunately, most of the med and science people rely on Apple products, and a lot of new apps still come to iOS first or are better updated and designed on iOS. Recreational, use a phone as a communication device and for fun: iPhone. The camera and social apps are fun to use on the iPhone. For older folks: This is a split. If you've used Apple products before, then iOS will be easy to learn. Android phones have gotten a LOT easier to use thanks to a big push from Google dealing with not only the UI from a software perspective but also from a design perspective. It is more intuitive than it used to be. Photographer, blogger, foodie: iPhone 6 still has the best selection of apps and arguably the best camera. Samsung's camera is great, but the company is known to really bog down their stellar devices with bloatware that ruins or significantly slows down your phone after 1 year of use. I love the HTC ONE in design, but their gamble on the cameras have not paid off for their customers or themselves. So was this the right switch for me? As I'm learning more about the iPhone and iOS, I've realized that when the two year is over or whenever this phone dies on me, I'll most likely switch back to Android. While I think I've been thoroughly spoiled by the fingerprint sensor, the productivity that I enjoyed on Android just doesn't replicate itself here on the iPhone. Maybe it's not meant to be a super productive machine, but I guess my main point is that I'd like to have that option available when I need it. Another side note: Most of the shortfalls of either Android and iOS can be bypassed via means of rooting, custom ROMs, and jailbreaking (in the case of iOS). And I do understand that a lot of people enjoy doing this and can get their phones to work fantastically well. I used to do a lot of customization and go through ROMs once every three days on my Android devices, but I've come to realize that I'd rather spend that time using the device than customizing it. So, nowadays, I just want my devices to work right out of the box. The little details like a great camera, fingerprint sensor, and the ability to have my dropbox synced on the go and a good notification system should all be there when I turn on my phone. Summary and TL; DR: So there you have it. An Android user's thoughts on using the iPhone 6. Do I have regrets switching over? After using my friend's One Plus One and seeing Material Design on my old N4, I definitely regret it. But for now, the iPhone 6 suits my needs, even if there are occasional frustration points. If you are an Android user, please consider all these points and google similar stories before switching. Also, I'm one of those workaholics and forever in search of super productivity, hence my review that I'd like to go back to Android. However, I know plenty of people who swear by their iPhones for productivity. If you are always connected and depend on a suite of iOS specific apps (including apps that are better designed or work better on iOS), then chances are you love the iPhone. There are plenty of things to like and love about either OS. It really does come down to personal preference. ***UPDATE 2/9/15: I got to try the new Outlook 2015 app by Microsoft, and it has alleviated a lot of the email/attachment issues that I have mentioned above. It allows you to sign into your Exchange, Outlook accounts as well as your Gmail, Yahoo, and iCloud emails. You can also integrate your OneDrive, GoogleDrive, Dropbox and Box accounts, and that's where the magic begins. Once integrated, you can attach any file located in those drives, which is great! You can also attach files that are attached in emails that are already in your inbox! And, you can now reply an email with the option of attaching a file. Finally, you can decide if you want to open up links from emails in Safari or another browser installed on your phone (so, you are no longer bound by default Apple apps). This is a huge step forward, and it's from Microsoft (a pleasant surprise). ***This app has really improved my productivity needs, since when considering the iPhone we have to take into account the hardware and the software/app ecosystem, i think this makes sense to bump up the rating to 4/5. There are still kinks when switching over if you are used to productive flexibility on Android phones, but right now the 3rd party apps are getting better and better at work-arounds. ***UPDATE 1/2/2017: The iPhone 6 has served me well over the past two years, but I've made the upgrade to the iPhone 7 a few months ago. If you are interested in reading about my thoughts on the iPhone 7, you can read my review here on Amazon https://www.amazon.com/review/R1WITRNVJL6ALR/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm.

Click to read the full review. Based on 46 User reviews. Small dimensions (4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 inches). Large camera sensor pixel size (1.5 μm). Lacks microSD slot for storage expansion. The iPhone 5s is not a radical departure in design for Apple, save for one very important feature. No, we don't mean the new Space Gray and Gold colors. We have in mind the home button that has been on iPhones from day one, is now turned into a fingerprint scanner dubbed Touch ID. It lets you unlock the phone and authorize purchases, safely storing your fingerprints in the A7 processor itself, out of the reach for anyone but a few default iOS 7 apps.. This A7 processor debuts on the iPhone 5s as the first 64-bit mobile chipset in use on a commercial device, utilized by the latest flat and minimalistic iOS 7 that has been rewritten to take advantage of the 64-bit system. It sports a dedicated M7 co-processor for always-on motion sensing, too.. The iSight camera stayed 8 MP, but is much improved, with larger pixels, wider aperture, and the ability to shoot slow motion videos, not to mention the dual two-tone LED flash on the back that strives for natural skin color representation..

OS: iOS (11.x, 10.x, 9.x, 8.x, 7.x). Dimensions: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 inches (123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6 mm). Weight: 3.95 oz (112 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 4.0 inches. Resolution: 640 x 1136 pixels. Features: Oleophobic coating, Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Sapphire crystal lens cover, Autofocus, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI). Software Features: Digital image stabilization, Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging.

Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Dual-core, 1300 MHz, Cyclone ARMv8, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Stand-by time: 10.4 days (250 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 10.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: TV-out. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards.

The iPhone's nano-SIM card tray is made of aluminum.. The iPhone 5S is a smartphone that was designed and marketed by Apple Inc. Part of the iPhone series , the device was unveiled on September 10, 2013, at Apple's Cupertino headquarters. It was released on September 20, 2013, along with its lower-cost counterpart, the iPhone 5c. The iPhone 5S maintains almost the same external design as its predecessor, the iPhone 5 , although the 5S received a new white/gold color scheme in addition to white/silver and space gray/black, however the 5S has vastly upgraded internal hardware. The 5S introduced the A7 64-bit dual-core system-on-chip, the first 64-bit processor to be used on a smartphone, accompanied by the M7 "motion co-processor". A redesigned home button with Touch ID , a fingerprint recognition system which can be used to unlock the phone and authenticate App Store and iTunes Store purchases, was introduced. The camera was also updated with a larger aperture and a dual-LED flash optimized for different color temperatures .. The iPhone 5S was the first Apple device to ship with iOS 7 , which introduced a revamped visual appearance and other new features. Designed by Jonathan Ive , iOS 7 departed from skeuomorphic elements used by previous versions of iOS in favor of a flat, colorful design. Among new software features introduced to the iPhone 5S were AirDrop , an ad-hoc Wi-Fi sharing platform; Control Center, a control panel containing a number of commonly used functions; and iTunes Radio , an internet radio service. Earphones known as EarPods were included with the 5S, and Apple released accessories including a case and a dock. The 5S is the third iPhone to support five major versions of iOS after the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5. The 5S supports iOS 7 up to version 11, being the oldest iPhone to support iOS 11 since it was the earliest to have incorporated a 64-bit SoC processor.. Reception towards the device was generally positive, with some outlets considering it to be the best smartphone available on the market due to its upgraded hardware, Touch ID, and other changes introduced by iOS 7. [15] Some criticized the iPhone 5S for keeping the design and small display of the iPhone 5, [16] and others expressed security concerns about the Touch ID system. [17] Nine million units of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were sold on their weekend of release, breaking Apple's sales record for iPhones. [18] The iPhone 5S was the best selling phone on all major U.S. The iPhone 5S was succeeded as Apple's flagship smartphone by the larger iPhone 6 in September 2014. On March 21, 2016, the 5S received a direct replacement with the announcement of the iPhone SE , which incorporated internal hardware similar to the iPhone 6S while retaining the smaller form factor and design of the 5S. 2.5 Operating system and software. 4.3 Impact of Touch ID. 5 Timeline of models. 5S was announced during a keynote at 4 Infinite Loop on September 10, 2013.. Before its official unveiling, media speculation primarily centered on reports that the next iPhone would include a fingerprint scanner ; including Apple's July 2012 acquisition of AuthenTec , a developer of mobile security products, [21] references to a fingerprint sensor on the home button in the beta release of iOS 7 [22] and leaked packaging for an iPhone 5S showing that the traditional home button now had a metallic "ring" around it. Similar ring-based imagery was seen on the official invitation to Apple's iPhone press event in September 2013, where the new device was unveiled. [23] Shortly before its official unveiling, The Wall Street Journal also reported the rumor. Apple announced the iPhone 5C and the iPhone 5S during a media event at its Cupertino headquarters on September 10, 2013. [14] [26] While the iPhone 5C became available for preorder on September 13, 2013, the iPhone 5S was not available for preorder. Both devices were released on September 20, 2013. [27] While most of the promotion focused on Touch ID , the 64-bit Apple A7 processor was also a highlight during the event.. This is the first-ever 64-bit processor in a phone of any kind. I don’t think the other guys are even talking about it yet. Why go through all this? The benefits are huge. The A7 is up to twice as fast as the previous-generation system at CPU tasks, and up to twice as fast at graphics tasks, too.. —  Phil Schiller , Apple keynote at 4 Infinite Loop on September 10, 2013 [28]. Schiller then showed demos of Infinity Blade III to demonstrate the A7's processing power and the device's camera using untouched photographs. [29] The release of iOS 7 on September 18, 2013 was also announced during the keynote. The iPhone 5S was released on September 20, 2013, in the United States , United Kingdom , Canada , China , France , Germany , Australia , Japan , Hong Kong , and Singapore. [30] It was released in 25 additional countries on October 25, 2013, and in 12 countries on November 1, 2013. Indonesia was the last country to receive the iPhone 5S, on January 26, 2014. On September 19, 2014, the iPhone 5S was succeeded as Apple's flagship smartphone by the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus , but the older model remained available for purchase at a reduced price, [32] while the 64GB version was discontinued. The gold edition of the iPhone 5S was discontinued on September 9, 2015, when Apple revealed the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus [33] [34] [35] [36]. The iPhone 5S was discontinued on March 21, 2016, and succeeded by the iPhone SE , which continues the same form factor but features vastly upgraded internals similar to the flagship iPhone 6S. [37] This was a break with Apple's product positioning trend (in North America and Western Europe ), starting with iPhone 4S released in October 2011, which gave each newly released model one year as the flagship phone, then moving it to midrange for its second year of production, with the third and final year as the entry-level offering before discontinuation. While iPhone 5S was expected to continue on sale until September 2016, replacing it and its A7 processor early means that Apple "just reduced its long-term chip support window by a year" for iOS. In addition, a new iPhone launch was meant to stimulate demand, as sales of iPhone 6S and 6S Plus had not met expectations since their September 2015 release and the iPhone family may suffer its first ever negative growth quarter in 2016. Design and Hardware of iPhone 5S. iPhone 5S's home button has a flat design and is made of scratch-resistant, laser -cut sapphire crystal surrounded by a stainless steel finger detection ring for using Touch ID .. The camera has a f/2.2 aperture and has dual "True Tone" flashes.. The "iPhone" wordmark on the back of an iPhone 5S is now set in a thinner version of the Myriad typeface.. The iPhone 5S maintains a similar design to the iPhone 5, with a 4. cm) LCD multi-touch Retina display and a screen resolution of 640×1136 at 326 ppi. [40] Its home button has been updated with a new flat design using a laser-cut sapphire cover surrounded by a metallic ring; the button is no longer concave, nor does it contain the familiar squircle icon seen on previous models. [41] The phone itself is 0.30. mm) thick and weighs 112 grams (4.0. [42] The phone uses an aluminum composite frame. [43] The device is available in three color finishes; "space-gray" (replacing black with slate trim on the iPhone 5), white with silver trim, and white with gold trim. [44] [45] The iPhone 5S was the first iPhone to be available in gold color; this decision was influenced by the fact that gold is seen as a popular sign of a luxury product among Chinese customers. The iPhone 5S is powered by the Apple A7 system-on-chip, the first 64-bit processor ever used on a smartphone. The device's operating system and pre-loaded software were optimized to run in 64-bit mode, promising increased performance, although third-party app developers would need to optimize their apps to take advantage of these enhanced capabilities. [47] The A7 processor is designed by Apple and manufactured by Samsung. [48] The A7 processor is accompanied by a new M7 "motion co-processor", a dedicated processor for processing motion data from the iPhone's accelerometer and gyroscopes without requiring the attention of the main processor, which integrates with iOS 7's new CoreMotion APIs. [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] The same A7 SoC and M7 motion co-processor are also found in the iPad Air and iPad Mini 2 which were released in the same quarter as the iPhone 5S.. The phone includes a 1560 mAh battery, which provides 10 hours of talk time and 250 hours of standby time. While the camera is still 8 megapixels in resolution with the image capture size of 3264 × 2448 (4:3), the lens has a larger aperture ( f /2.2) and larger sized pixels in its image sensor than previous iPhone models. The flashlight has dual "True Tone" flashes, consisting of an amber LED and a white LED, which are variably used based on the color temperature of the photo to improve color balancing. The camera also includes automatic image stabilization, dynamic tone mapping , 10 fps burst mode , "best shot" mode and slow motion video at 120 fps. The home button on the iPhone 5S incorporates a fingerprint recognition system known as Touch ID , based on technology from AuthenTec, [58] a company which Apple had acquired in 2012. The sensor uses a capacitive CMOS -based sensor which can detect the "sub-epidermal layers" of fingers at 500 pixels per inch , and uses a 360-degree design that can read the print at any angle. The sensor itself is activated by a touch-sensitive metallic ring surrounding the button. Touch ID can be used for various authentication activities within the operating system, such as unlocking the device or authenticating App Store and iTunes purchases instead of an Apple ID password. The sensor can be trained to recognize the fingerprints of multiple fingers and multiple users. Fingerprint data is stored in an encrypted format within a "secure enclave" of the A7 chip itself, and is not accessible to any other apps or servers (including iCloud ). You can capture photos at night as it comes with a double LED flash with rear camera. The iPhone 5S sports a new 8 megapixel iSight camera with the new camera app allowing fast continuous shooting and recording of slow-motion videos. Earphones known as Apple EarPods are included with the iPhone 5S. [64] According to technology commentators, the design of the earphones is aimed to improve sound quality by allowing air to travel in and out more freely. [65] [66] Apple states that the design of their earphones allows it to "rival high-end headphones that cost hundreds of dollars more". [65] Reviews by Gizmodo and TechRadar reported that although the earphones sounded better than its predecessor, reviewers felt that quality of sound produced is poor. [67] TechRadar further opined that the EarPods are inferior to other earphones of a similar price. Main articles: iOS , iOS 7 , iOS 8 , iOS 9 , iOS 10 , and iOS 11. Further information: iOS version history. The iPhone 5S is supplied with iOS. 7, released on September 20, 2013. [68] Jonathan Ive , the designer of iOS 7's new elements, described the update as "bringing order to complexity", highlighting features such as refined typography, new icons, translucency, layering, physics, and gyroscope-driven parallaxing as some of the major changes to the design. The design of both iOS 7 and OS X Yosemite (version 10.10) noticeably departs from skeuomorphic elements such as green felt in Game Center , wood in Newsstand , and leather in Calendar , in favor of flat, colorful design. iOS 7 adds AirDrop , an ad-hoc Wi-Fi sharing platform. Users can share files with the iPhone 5 onwards, the iPod Touch (5th generation) , iPad (4th generation) onwards, or iPad Mini (1st generation) onwards. [69] [71] The operating system also adds Control Center, a control panel accessed by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. Control Center contains a number of commonly used functions, such as volume and brightness controls, along with toggles for enabling Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Airplane mode , and for using the rear camera's flash LED as a flashlight. iTunes Radio , an Internet radio service, is also included on the iPhone 5S. It is a free, ad-supported service available to all iTunes users, featuring Siri integration on iOS. Users are able to skip tracks, customise stations, and purchase the station's songs from iTunes Store. Users can also search through their history of previous songs. During the keynote, Apple announced a case for the iPhone 5 that is made of soft microfiber on the inside and leather on the outside. This case was announced along with iPhone 5C's case, both of which are the first cases Apple has announced since the iPhone 4 Bumpers. Docks for both the iPhone 5S [75] and 5C were found on the Apple online store after the announcement. Because of the casing difference between the iPhone 5S and 5C, they have separate docks, each made specifically for each respective phone. The iPhone 5S received a mostly positive reception from reviewers and commentators. Walt Mossberg of All Things Digital gave the phone a favorable review, saying that Touch ID "sounds like a gimmick, but it’s a real advance, the biggest step ever in biometric authentication for everyday devices," and labeled it "the best smartphone on the market." [15] David Pogue of The New York Times praised Touch ID, but said that the innovation of the smartphone market has been saturated, and "maybe the age of annual mega-leaps is over." He focused much of his review on iOS 7, which he believed was the biggest change of the device over previous generations, praising new Siri features, Control Center, and AirDrop. [77] In an editorial, Pogue stated that iOS 7 was the biggest change in the iPhone series, citing utilitarian interface changes as the main contributor to this. [78] Scott Stein of CNET criticized the lack of design change over iPhone 5 and said that although the iPhone 5S "is not a required upgrade, but it's easily the fastest and most advanced Apple smartphone to date." [16] Although praised for its camera, 64-bit A7 chip, M7 motion-chip, and fingerprint scanning capabilities, some investors thought that the iPhone 5S, although a notable improvement over the iPhone 5, was still relatively unchanged from its predecessor, and worried that the iPhone line had become a stagnant, dull product. Apple's share price fell 5.4% after the launch to close at a month low of $467.71 on the NASDAQ. Darrell Etherington of TechCrunch who praised the iPhone 5S as the best smartphone available said "looks may not be different from the iPhone 5, but the internal components have a dramatic impact on day-to-day activities normal for a smartphone user," and went into detail explaining the impact of the improved camera and specifications on the phone. Etherington suggested that the 64-bit A7 processor will not reach its full potential until developers create applications supporting it. [80] Myriam Joire of Engadget found that the iPhone 5S could benefit significantly from the A7 if developers created applications optimized for the 64-bit processor. [81] Anand Lal Shimpi of AnandTech praised the phone's A7 processor, describing it as "seriously impressive", and stated that it was the most "futureproof of any iPhone ever launched. As much as it pains me to use the word futureproof, if you are one of those people who likes to hold onto their device for a while - the iPhone 5S is as good a starting point as any." [82] Scott Lowe of IGN also spoke highly of its 64-bit processor, "which has a substantial lead in processing power over the HTC One and Samsung Galaxy S4 , accounting for a graphics boost of up to 32% and 38% in CPU benchmarks." The debut of Apple's 64-bit A7 processor took rival Android smartphone makers by surprise, particularly Qualcomm whose own 64-bit system-on-chip was not released until 2015. Most reviewers recommended the iPhone 5S over the iPhone 5C which was released at the same time. The 5C retained almost the same hardware as the discontinued iPhone 5, while the iPhone 5S featured substantially improved performance/features thanks to its new 64-bit A7 processor, as well as extra storage space, all for a relatively small additional upfront cost over the iPhone 5C (US$650 versus US$550 in March 2014). This was especially the case when iOS 8 was released and both iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were moved to the mid and low end of the iPhone range, respectively; the iPhone 5S still had 16 or 32 GB storage available while the iPhone 5C had to make do with 8 GB storage with only 4.9GB available to the user after installing iOS 8. Furthermore, the 5C's polycarbonate exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost-cutting downgrade compared to the iPhone 5's aluminum/glass case; the 5S retained the latter design and looked even more premium due its additional gold finish. As of 2015–16, there were still a significant number of customers who preferred the 4-inch screen size of iPhone 5S, which remained the second-most popular iPhone after the iPhone 6 and ahead of the iPhone 6S. Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015, even as that form factor was succeeded as the flagship iPhone by the redesigned larger display 4.7/5.5-inch iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in September 2014. Furthermore, the 5 and 5S design was regarded as "long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general" (with the 5S's gold finish adding a premium touch to the 5's already well-regarded look), while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it "felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap". The iPhone 5 was described as "elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, iPhone 5 didn’t really look like anything else on the market at the time". However, the iPhone 5/5S design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus phablet models. When Apple discontinued the iPhone 5S, it was replaced by the iPhone SE which outwardly appears almost identical to the 5S even as the SE's internal hardware has been upgraded significantly. The iPhone 5S and 5C sold over nine million units in the first three days, setting a record for first weekend smartphone sales, [18] with the 5S selling three times more units than the 5C. After the first day of release, 1% of all iPhones in the US were iPhone 5Ss, while 0.3% were iPhone 5Cs. [87] Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray reported that the line at the Fifth Avenue Apple Store contained 1,417 people on release day, compared to 1,300 for the iPhone 4 in 2010, and 549 for the iPhone 3G in 2008 on their respective release days. [88] This was the first time that Apple launched two models simultaneously. The first-day release in China also contributed to the record sales result. On launch day, major in-stock shortages were reported in most stores, across all countries where the iPhone 5S initially went on sale. [90] A great many customers in line outside Apple Stores worldwide were left disappointed due to severe shortages across all 5S models, with the gold model in particular being in highly limited supply. [91] While this situation eased in the US in the days following the launch, other countries reported receiving few restocks. [92] Some commentators questioned how Apple handled the initial release, as online pre-orders were not offered for the iPhone 5S, meaning large numbers of people queuing outside physical stores, with most in line not receiving a unit. [93] In the US, Apple offered an online reservation system, so customers could keep checking for units available at their local Apple Stores, and order for pickup. [94] Online orders were also in short supply on launch day, with the shipping date across all model sizes and colors changing from "7-10 working days" to "October" in all countries, within hours of online orders being taken. The iPhone 5S was the best selling phone on AT&T , Sprint , Verizon , and T-Mobile in September 2013 in the United States, outselling the iPhone 5C and Samsung Galaxy S4. [19] According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, the iPhone 5S outsold the 5C by a two-to-one margin during its September release, confirming Apple CEO Tim Cook 's view that the high-end smartphone market was not reaching a point of market saturation. [97] While commentators viewed the 5C as a flop because of supply chain cuts signifying a decline in demand, the 5S was viewed as a massive success. Apple admitted that it had failed to anticipate the sales ratio, leading to an overstocking of the 5C and shortages of the 5S. Six months after the release of the iPhone 5S, on March 25, 2014, Apple announced that sales of the iPhone brand had exceeded 500 million units. [99] By May 2014, despite having been on the market for eight months, the iPhone 5S reportedly outsold the newly released Samsung Galaxy S5 by 40%, with 7 million iPhone 5S units versus 5 million Galaxy S5 units. The Galaxy S5's failure to oust the iPhone 5S from the top selling spot was a major setback for Samsung Mobile, as the preceding Samsung Galaxy SIII and Samsung Galaxy S4 , in the first quarter of their releases, had outsold the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 respectively. See also: Touch ID §. A number of technology writers, including Adrian Kingsley-Hughes of ZDNet [101] and Kevin Roose of New York believed that the fingerprint scanning functionality of the iPhone 5S could help spur the adoption of the technology as an alternative to passwords by mainstream users (especially in " bring your own device " scenarios), as fingerprint-based authentication systems have only enjoyed wider usage in enterprise environments. However, citing research by biometrics engineer Geppy Parziale, [102] Roose suggested that the CMOS-based sensor could become inaccurate and wear out over time unless Apple had designed the sensor to prevent this from occurring. [103] Brent Kennedy, a researcher of the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team , recommended that users not immediately rely on the technology, citing the uncertainty over whether the system could properly reject a spoofed fingerprint. Following the release of the iPhone 5S, the German Chaos Computer Club announced on September 21, 2013 that they had bypassed Apple's new Touch ID fingerprint sensor by using "easy everyday means". The group explained that the security system had been defeated by photographing a fingerprint from a glass surface and using that captured image to make a latex model thumb which was then pressed against the sensor to gain access. The spokesman for the group stated, "We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics. It is plain stupid to use something that you can't change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token." [17] [59] However, in 2013, 39% of American smartphone users used no security measures at all to protect their smartphone. [105] Others have also tried Chaos Computer Club's method, but concluded that it is not an easy process in either time or effort, given that the user has to use a high resolution photocopy of a complete fingerprint, special chemicals and expensive equipment, and because the spoofing process takes some time to achieve. Several problems were experienced with the iPhone 5S's hardware after its release. The most widely reported issue is that the angle reported by the phone's level sensor had drifted by several degrees, which caused the gyroscope , compass, and accelerometer to become inaccurate. Reports suggested that this is a hardware-induced problem. [107] [108] Some encountered other problems such as crashing with a blue screen and then restarting, the power button making a rattling noise when the phone was shaken, overheating, the microphone not working, and Touch ID not working for iTunes purchases. Some of these issues have been fixed by software updates. Sources: Apple press release library [110]. ^ "iPhone 5S Models". ^ Dumlao, Doris (October 25, 2013). "iPhone 5s, 5c coming to PH Nov.

All iPhones 5s models are Sim Free - No Contract Required. 4inch (diagonal) widescreen Multi-Touch display Video calling with a 1.2 MP 720P FaceTime front camera Retina display with 1136 x 640 resolution 1080p HD video recording 8-megapixel iSight camera with LED flash Apple EarPods with remote and mic Apple A7 processor 16GB Memory Siri Voice Control Available in Space Grey, (Slate Colour) Gold or Silver. The iPhone 5s is the newest and most exciting model from Apple! This version is Apples flagship model which is now the most powerful, responsive and efficient iPhone so far.. This is the redesigned, biggest model of the iPhone, so what's new?. Apple’s new A7 chip is up to twice as fast as the previous A6 chip giving its users up to 10 hours talking time, 10 hours browsing time and a massive 10 hours video playback. The new iPhone 5s is quick and we mean quick; the iPhone 5 responds to tasks and processes so fast that it’s near instantaneous.. The iPhone 5 still has its 8MP camera but it’s been improved with the new iSight feature. Users can take panoramic pictures, Facetime in HD and take pictures up to 40% quicker than the older iPhone 4 models. The iPhone 5s will now lead the competition with improvements such as the new face recognition, the 720P HD camera for Facetime and new options to take pictures while still shooting in stunning 1080P HD video.. These are a big feature for the iPhone 5s. After years of testing Apple have brought us the EarPod headphones. Apple wanted to build earphones that would rest comfortably inside everybody’s ears but after testing on hundreds of people, they found that everybody’s ears are different and 1 persons earphones won’t always fit another. The EarPods are a breakthrough in earphones and they will enhance the audio for all iPhone 5s users. The EarPods are designed with three microphones: one at the front, one at the back and one at the bottom of the bud. The front and back microphones work in harmony to achieve “beamforming” — This is a technique that helps the iPhone 5s focus on sound from the desired location and create clearer audio.. Xpango members can receive their Free iPhone 5s shipped directly from Apple without the need to sign a contract. You can use it in your native country with no network locks on the handset.. Microsoft Xbox 360 - Game Pack. We hate spam as much as you do. Xpango will not share member details with 3rd parties, as detailed within our privacy policy ..
