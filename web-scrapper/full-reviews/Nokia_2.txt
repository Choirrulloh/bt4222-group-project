I have procured Nokia 03 in the month of August'17. Within a span of 03 months, battery issue has started. When we have approached their service station located at Vadodara, the person named as Mr. Darshan had behaved with arrogance, They have asked to keep the phone and they will take a week time to replace battery. When we requested for stand-by handset, they just denied. Their behaviour, product and sales services is poor. I do not recommend to purchase NOKIA because of the worst hardware and very poor after sales services. I AM A HIGHLY DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER OF NOKIA.. Was this review helpful?

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. A slick phone for the price. What is a hands on review?. A solid performer, albeit a little slow to use and will only suit those looking for a very basic, well-made Android smartphone. Nokia 2 price and release date Design and screen Camera and battery Interface Early verdict. The Nokia 2 is the latest handset from HMD Global, the brand behind the Finnish phone-maker's renaissance, and it's designed to do one thing: bring a decent smartphone experience at a lower cost.. It's not got a high cost, coming at €99 (around $115, £85, AU$150) , but it's got a lower-end spec list to match - but with a more premium styling to make it feel more premium than the price tag might suggest.. Is that something that's possible for any manufacturer, let alone one that's barely a year into a reboot?. As mentioned, you'll be able to pick up the Nokia 2 for €99 (around $115, £85, AU$150) , which is a thoroughly competitive price point for a a smartphone with pretty much any spec list.. The Nokia 2 release date is set for 'early 2018', with exact locations for launch yet to be confirmed.. The Nokia 2 looks like a phone that's far more expensive than it should be. Especially in the copper color, which mirrors that of the high-end Nokia 8 , it instantly feels nicer in the hand.. Sadly only the rim is metal and colored (the black version looks more muted too), and the plastic back doesn't feel as expensive. It also sucks up any oil or fingerprints, so can look messy easily. You can remove the back cover to access the SIM port and microSD slot, but the battery isn't removable.. However, it's a well-made phone, solid in the hand and bringing the 5-inch screen to the fore nicely. There's no fingerprint scanner (as you can imagine for the price) but it's also got the buttons in the right place for locking and unlocking easily.. Fingerprints are not the Nokia 2's friend. The headphone jack is present and correct, and it's still using microUSB, rather than USB-C at the bottom for connections... again, just what you'd expect at this price point.. We were actually impressed with the HD screen, which is pretty low-res by today's smartphone standards. While it's nowhere near as powerful as other phones, it's clear and bright enough to not irritate - and you don't feel like it's that low-res in the hand.. Predictably, a movie experience isn't as strong, but for a quick YouTube session it's just fine.. The Nokia 2 has a 8MP sensor, with not a lot else to really say about it. The pictures it takes are clear enough, pack some sharpness and focus in a fairly decent time.. However, the quality is far from sterling, and you'll be using this to capture memories when needed, rather than a phone you put in your pocket to really get some cracking snaps.. Again, this is entirely acceptable for the price point, and we've seen cheap phones take far worse photos - although the camera interface is slow and doesn't really offer than many customisation options.. However, there is a flash, which is something that's often overlooked.. The Nokia 2 battery life is obviously something we couldn't test in the few hours we had with the phone, but HMD is claiming that it'll last two days without a charge - something that could well bear out given the spec list, as it has a 4100mAh battery pack inside.. That's probably because you're not going to be a power user if you go for a phone like the Nokia 2, so for its main role of 'sitting quietly in a pocket' it'll save some decent battery power - the lower-power Snapdragon 212 CPU, along with 1GB. of RAM will help that too.. The only place that the Nokia 2 falls down is in the operation, and that's fairly considerable. Swiping around the home screen, firing up the camera, jumping into the settings is all very slow and juddery - which isn't what you want from any phone.. That said, it's at least predictable in its speed, so you know when you're going to have to wait for something to load. If you're not going to use the phone a lot, that's not going to be the biggest problem, but if you want to use lots of apps or just constantly use the web browser or camera then you're going to struggle.. It's only got a very paltry 8GB of storage on board, and while you can add in a microSD card into the mix (up to 128GB) that won't help if you want to download loads of songs on Spotify or have plenty of apps on board.. It's hard not to be a little impressed with what HMD's put together with the Nokia 2, as it all comes together in a robust package for not much cash.. The performance of the phone suffers from the lower spec list, but there has to be some offset to allow for the price - that said, we hope that the HMD engineers tune up the speed a little before launch, as our prototype unit doesn't work fast enough to not grate.. But overall, the Nokia 2 has a great design for the cost, an acceptable camera, possibly strong battery life and brings some of the decent elements from more expensive phones to a cheaper unit..

Hands-on with Nokia 2: Itâs not about the specs!. by Abhishek Baxi October 31, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. After a slew of budget and mid-range devices â Nokia 3, Nokia 5, and Nokia 6 â HMD Global announced its most affordable device as yet, the Nokia 2 , priced at â¬99 ($115).. The Nokia 2 comes with Android 7.1.2 Nougat out-of-the-box, and like with all Nokia devices it comes with the promise of pure and up-to-date Android experience. This means that Nokia 2 will get monthly security updates and will be upgraded to Android Oreo âsoonâ.. If you judge smartphones by their specifications sheet, Nokia 2 is not for you. It packs in modest specifications, not in foolhardiness but backed by obvious conviction and understanding of the market. Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 212 processor, the Nokia 2 packs in just 1 GB of RAM. In the limited time I spent with the device, I found the performance to be generally smooth – although the demo unit did not have any third-party apps installed. Itâs not a crawl as many ignorantly expect as soon as they look at the specifications. Iâm assuming the hardware optimizes background apps to ensure enough memory is available at all times.. The 8 GB internal storage on the Nokia 2 is of course quite less, more so because less than 5 GB of free space is available out of the box. But thankfully, you can extend storage up to 128 GB with a microSD card, something most users would have to.. The Nokia 2 sports a 5-inch HD LTPS LCD and the 720p display offers nice contrast ratio and looks sharp. It is clearly one of the better screens in this price segment. Thereâs also Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection which is a sweet addition.. The highlight of the smartphone is it’s much-hyped â2-day battery lifeâ. Instead of making a power-bank in the guise of a phone, HMD Global manages to squeeze in a 4,100 mAh battery in a compact chassis and banks on the frugal processor as well as the power-efficient display for that extra juice. Weâll find out if Nokia 2 lives up to that claim when we take it for a spin for a longer duration. Thereâs no fast charging, mind you.. For a budget smartphone, the Nokia 2 impressed me with its camera performance. I took a few test shots while checking out the device, and the 8-megapixel primary camera looked quite interesting. Iâd like to explore it more when I review the device once itâs available. The auto-focus camera comes with automatic scene detection as well as LED flash. Thereâs also the 5-megapixel fixed-focus front camera which would serve you well for some decent selfies. The Nokia 2 offers unlimited photo and video uploads to Google Photos â a neat deal for a budget smartphone.. The best thing about the Nokia 2 is its design and build quality, which is why I kept it for the last. It looks quite chic with a metal frame milled out of series 6000 aluminum and a sculpted polycarbonate back. The matte finish at the back and the compact form factor owing to a 5-inch display makes gives it pleasant ergonomics and it feels great in the hand.

Misc: FM radio, 3.5mm jack, back-firing single speaker. Nokia 1 to 10 - a Nokia for everyone. Well, we're getting there - after the famed brand's return with the Nokia 6 in early 2017, the 5 and 3 followed, and then the flagship Nokia 8 came to be. The 7 showed up later filling one of the gaps, though not everywhere in the world - like the others, actually. The portfolio's expansion continues into the entry-level segment with the Nokia 2 - a budget model if there ever was one, priced around the $100 mark.. What that gets you in Nokia world is a 5-inch 720p display - pretty great at this price point if you ask us. Going by the numbers, it could be the same as the one on the Nokia 3, so thumbs up to Nokia for not digging up a qHD panel (small 'q' - 540x960px) long forgotten in some distant warehouse. It's covered with Gorilla Glass 3, so there's no complaints about that either.. Where things start looking gloomy is the chipset - the Snapdragon 212 is an old dog, a minor upgrade to the 210, neither of which is particularly quick. And that's just us being polite. A single gigabyte of RAM and 8GB of storage further reinforce the feeling we're looking at a smartwatch specsheet.. Smartwatches don't typically have cameras, and we certainly haven't heard of ones with two shooters. The Nokia 2 is no wearable and does have a pair - an 8MP camera on the back, and a 5MP front-facing unit. What it lacks in oomph, the Nokia 2 makes up for in battery - a 4,100mAh power pack promises plenty of on time, 2 days Nokia says. There are goodies you won't find on most flagships though - like the dedicated microSD slot, whether the Nokia 2 is single or dual SIM. There's an FM radio receiver too, beat that, Pixel 2!. There's no Wi-Fi ac, LTE download speeds are limited to 150Mbps, and the charging port is microUSB, but should you really expect more in this price segment? There's a headphone jack, after all, if we haven't mentioned a Pixel 2 recently for no apparent reason, ahem.. Now, if we weren't thrilled with the Nokia 3's performance when we had it over for review, what does that say about the humble 2? Nothing, not yet at least - we'll be evaluating it on its own merits. Let's get it out of its box first.. The Nokia 2 comes in an unassuming small cardboard box with the phone printed on top, in a 'connecting people' context, of course. Jokes aside, there's everything to get you started: a 5V/2A charger, a USB cable, and even a basic headset.. The Nokia 2 is a rather unassuming, but well built phone. There's a metal frame all around it, and despite the color scheme being called Pewter/Black, the frame is not made of pewter, but is aluminum instead. It feels nicely cold and expensive, that latter enhanced by the non-black pewter color.. The back, on the other hand, is very much black and unmistakably plastic. That's not a bad thing in and of itself - we've repeatedly insisted that there's nothing wrong with plastic on a phone. This one in particular does tend to smudge and is not very easy to clean, but the prints aren't all that visible.. One good thing about the back cover is that it's removable - yay. Only the battery isn't - bummer. Still, a removable cover can be easily replaced if broken or all scratched up. Another positive side of this approach is that you don't need a pin to insert a SIM card or a memory card - we had a hundred pins at the office at one time (thanks, Victor!), but lately it's been a quest finding one - point being pins get lost.. There's a Nokia logo in the middle of the back cover, a shiny recessed one. A cutout in the panel lets the camera take a peek at the world, its LED flash nearby. The loudspeaker is down in the right corner, a placement we've come to see less often. There's a small pimple that prevents it from being muffled when the phone is lying flat on a hard surface.. Pop the cover off, and you'll see a nano SIM slot on either side of the phone. The left one is a simple slide in type, while the right one is a push-to-insert, push-to-eject affair. The rationale likely is that the right SIM slot is underneath the microSD slot, so the push action saves you the hassle of having to remove the memory card to get at the SIM card. Oh, yes, you can have all three cards in at the same time, the microSD gets its own dedicated slot.. Perhaps you got overly excited hearing of a removable back cover thinking you can swap out the battery too - we know we did. Sadly, that's not the case - you have at least a dozen screws of two different sizes standing in your way - not impossible, just not something you'd be doing on a daily basis.. Matte plastic back  Cover off  Camera. Snap the cover back on and flip the phone to see another Nokia logo greet you from the top right corner above the 5-inch display. The earpiece is in the middle, duh, and right next to it are the proximity and ambient light sensors, with the 5MP front camera further to the left. There's nothing in the bottom bezel, at least nothing immediately usable on the front - there's certainly stuff inside. So yes, there's plenty of meat around the display - the Nokia 2 makes no bold full screen promises and is a classic chunky bar.. The power button and the volume rocker are on the right side. Even if we tend to advocate for putting them on opposite sides, in this case the power button is below the volume rocker and the placement works much better than the reverse arrangement you'd find, say, on a Pixel 2 - that's a hat trick of things the Nokia 2 does better than the Pixel 2.. On the bottom, you'll find the microUSB 2.0 port - apparently USB-C is still too expensive. Right next to it is the groove in the aluminum frame where you need to stick your fingernail to get the back cover off - neat. The primary mic gets its own dedicated pinhole.. Another pinhole can be found on top, this one for the secondary mic. The 3.5mm jack is also here.. Nokia logo in the top bezel  microUSB/loudspeaker  3.5mm jack/controls . The Nokia 2 measures 143.5 x 71.3 x 9.3 mm which is a few millimeters taller and about a mil wider than the competing Redmis of the world - 4, 4A, and 5A. The Nokia is heavier than all of them too - its 161g are closer to the Redmi 4's 150g, while the As are in the 130-somethings. That said, the Nokia 2 doesn't really feel too heavy..

Nokia 2 TA-1035 8GB Smartphone (Pewter/Black) is rated. Rated 5 out of. Super functional, albeit laggy w 1gb ram, but current OS makes for intuitiveness. One day, 19 hours from last charge, (all day streaming music use) 66% battery, approx 3 days left. I'm really impressed and took the plunge for 100 bux and have no ragrets at all, especially w both att and t mobile sims in the device w smooth dual usage. me phone has been dropped at least 3 times onto concrete without shattering, just a nick in the paint which happens when ur not careful. Might wanna clear coat it not. Rated 3 out of. Good basic phone for calls & email but don't plan on more. If you need a dual sim mobile phone for making phone calls then you can't beat this price.� If you need to do more than make phone calls then look elsewhere.. I figured I'd give it a try but the limited memory (1GB) makes the phone lag for almost all activities.� Even more problematic is the limited onboard storage (8GB).� Granted, you can add a memory card, which I did, however most apps install to the onboard storage rather than the memory card and almost all of the apps stored data on the onboard storage (only some apps allowed for selection of storage onboard or external card).� Today I received a warning that the phone was out of space so some functions would be limited.� This is not workable for me so the experiment is over after one day.. Rated 5 out of. Great value for an unlocked phone. For $99 all in, it's tough to price to beat for an phone that can be used almost anywhere in the world.. Rated 4 out of. Good basic phone with Android 7. I bought this phone as a cheaper version of Nokia 6 (2017) which I owe for half a year and love. There was one big surprise for me in Nokia 2 phone - it is capable of carrying 2 SIM cards AND a memory card SIMULTANEOUSLY!!! In other words, no "hybrid tray" where you can use two SIM cards OR one SIM card and a memory card. This is rare these days, and I do miss this feature in Nokia 6. I am planning to use Nokia 2 during my trips to Europe and as a backup phone here in the US. I like certain features of this phone: it's simplicity, minimal number of pre-installed applications, long battery life, dual SIM + memory card capacity, 4G speed, Android 7.1.1 platform. Sound is very good, reception is strong. It feels good in my hand, I like its design. I would not say that I like cameras in this phone. They are not bad, of course, and do decent job. Screen is OK - not very impressive. I also miss fingerprint scanner, available in Nokia 6. I did not have any problems yet with 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of storage space. I did not notice that this phone is slow. But I am not a heavy user of games or lots of applications/ Main use of this Nokia 2 phone is communication (phone calls, SMS, MMS, emails, Skype, Viber). I also use it as a hotspot to connect my tablet to the Internet. For these applications, this phone completely meets my expectations. And for the price, I think this phone is really good.. Rated 5 out of. If you are a heavy gamer, don't buy this phone.� However, so far it meets my needs as I just surf the net and check my emails.� I own a Nokia a while ago and the built for this seems good.� Cheers. Rated 5 out of. Battery lasted almost a full two days even with the big screen. Rated 2 out of. This phone has good technical specifications for NA users. It supports 4G/3G dual SIM stanby and 3G 1700 AWS frequency, which are not mentioned in product information.�. �After I set up the phone, it reboots once or twice a day automatically. It looked like to update SW but I couldn't find any changes on it. So I reported this issue to Nokia.. �UPS delivery was a terrible experience. By the tracking information, there was a few days stay in their depot� and it took two weeks to get this.. Rated 2 out of. I do not own this phone. However, I found it has only 1GB of RAM and this will make very difficult to use with several apps. How do I know? I am actually using another cell phone with just 1GB of RAM (other brand) and I feel my phone needs more RAM. Hope to find a great replacement for my cell phone soon..

Nokia has given a solid comeback with their Android phones a few months back when they introduced Nokia 3, 5, and 6 smartphones. After that, the more premium Nokia 7 and 8 were released. These were quite successful as well. Now, they have released more of a budget phone named Nokia 2. But here, there are going to face some serious challenges.. So, why Nokia 2 can become a big flop especially in Bangladesh or other Asian and south-east Asian countries? The price of Nokia 2 is almost 10K. For 10K, they are offering features like 8 GB ROM, 1 GB RAM, Snapdragon 212 chipset and HD video recording. Companies like Symphony are Giving these feature for half the price. For 10K you will easily get 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM and full HD video recording from brands like Lava, Symphony or Walton. Even Nokia is really a great brand, very few people would pay so much price for such low specs. Especially because this phone belongs to the low price category. There is no doubt that the design is quite nice, build quality is great, there is 4G network and it comes with a 4100 mAh strong battery with up to 1340 hours of 3G standby time. But we do think that the RAM, ROM, and Chipset are not really worth the price. It is for you to decide if you would prioritize brand over performance.. User Rating: 2.15 ( 114 votes).

Mobiles / Nokia Mobile Phones / Nokia 2 Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 28,697 Launch Date in India: 24 November, 2017 Compare. The cult handset maker, Nokia made a comeback with its trio of Android handsets recently. Nokia 2 is the upcoming smartphone in the same series and will be the cheapest of the lot. While the handset scores high on build quality as expected, it is slightly underpowered compared to the competition. Here is a brief overview of the device as to why and why not should you buy the smartphone.. One of the USP that the brand was banking on was the stock Android operating system on its smartphones. Any enthusiast worth his/her salt would know that having a stock Android is a blessing as it contributes to much better and smoother experience. Moreover, Nokia is promising that its smartphones would be the first to get newest and upcoming Android Oreo update. This is a pretty good reason to go for this handset as no other handset at this price offers the same.. Back when Nokia was still relevant, users swore by the build quality of the Nokia devices and they lasted really long. The brand brought the same build quality to smartphone domain when it came out with its Android lineup. According to reviews, all three handsets launched so far have been extremely sturdy and durable. We can expect the upcoming Nokia 2 to come with the same build quality albeit with a plastic make.. Apart from the build quality, if there is one thing that Nokia loyalists swore by, it has to be the imaging prowess of their devices. The Nokia 2 is expected to come with an 8MP rear camera and 5MP selfie snapper on the front panel. And if the record of Nokia is anything to go by, the Nokia 2 would impress as well.. At a time, when every other smartphone in budget segment is coming with either quad-core or octa-core processor, Nokia 2 is also offering quad-core processor albeit an underpowered one. The Snapdragon 212 processor on Nokia 2 happens to be one of the better SoC in this segment, however, there are even better processors out there.. While the handset is pretty good value for money and comes with decent specifications, however, it could have benefited from a more aggressive pricing. There are much better devices like Xiaomi Redmi 4 and Redmi Note 4 available at this price, which flaunt a much better processor and build quality.. Black +3 Variants. 6,199 .00. 6,590 .00.
