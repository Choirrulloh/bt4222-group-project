The Lumia 950 and 950 XL may be the Lumia devices that everyone knows about, but apparently that’s not all Microsoft has to offer.. According to a tip from a source who wishes to remain anonymous, Microsoft is also planning 3 additional Lumia devices – the Lumia 550, 750 and 850.. The Lumia 550 is the low-end budget Lumia here, offering a Snapdragon 210 paired with an Adreno 304 GPU, 1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of internal storage and. a microSD card slot which offers a storage ceiling of 208 GB (200GB SD card + 8 GB internal storage).. device is also said to have a 5”. qHD Gorilla Glass 3 screen, along with a 5 MP rear camera with autofocus and a 2MP front facing camera. While the screen resolution is less than the resolution of its immediate successor the 540, Microsoft may be intent on keeping the 5xx line as its low-budget line and cancelling out the short-lived unprofitable. Under this context slightly reduced specs make more sense. In addition, a qHd screen would be far easier for a device equipped with a Snapdragon 210 to handle. Here are the Lumia 550 specs in one simple list:. Moving on, we also have specs for the midrange Lumia 750 which we assume to be one of the two Microsoft business focused devices along with the 850. The Lumia 750 will have a Snapdragon 410 processor clocked at 1.2ghz paired with an Adreno 306 GPU, a first for the Lumia line. Its screen size and camera receive a bump to an 8 MP Zeiss lens and a 5 inch HD screen.. The 5 MP front facing camera from the Lumia 730. and 640 XL will be retained for maximum selfies, hopefully with the influx of new apps Windows 10 should bring. Rounding out the specs are a healthy 2650 mAh battery, 8GB of built-in storage with SD Card support for a potential 208 GB of storage for apps and media and support for LED notifications. All things taken together, the 750 sounds like a worthy upgrade to the 730. Here are the full specs of the Lumia 750 in one simple list:. Finally, we have the specs of the Lumia 850. Like the other two, it is equipped with a 5 inch screen although it gets a WXGA screen rather than a HD or FHD screen.. Similarly to the Lumia 750 it comes with a Snapdragon 410 albeit one which is clocked at 1.4 ghz rather than 1.2 ghz. It is equipped with 16 GB of internal storage that can be expanded up to 216 GB via Micro SD.. Optics wise, it is said to have a 10 MP PureView Zeiss lens camera with a 5 MP camera ( a standard feature?). The spec sheet lists support for video up to. @ 30 fps which we’d tag as being likely due to prototype status. The battery is the same as the 750 with 2650 mAh, which paired with the screen resolution and SD 410 should provide. Here are the full specs of the Lumia 850:. The specs given are prototype specs and subject to future alteration, but that appears to be what Microsoft’s working towards at the moment. While Satya’s email may have given some doubt towards the future of the Lumia line, it appears that Microsoft is instead cutting off devices like the 635, 638, 636, 920 T, 532 etc and. “focussing” them into one main device instead.. Our source also had some words to say about the Windows 10 update for mobile. He/she revealed to use that Microsoft had set September as the target for completion of the OS, with October being the target for OTA updates.. This matches with the rumored dates of the Lumia 950 launch (at IFA most likely), Windows. 10 Update 1, and the French carrier target dates. Assuming this is accurate, Windows 10 mobile still has one more month of active development and feature additions to go.. What do you think of all these recent leaks?

Microsoft Lumia 750 Or Lumia 850 (RM-1182) Gets Certification In China Ahead Of Expected MWC 2016 Debut. 14 January 2016, 9:00 am EST By Alexandra Burlacu Tech Times. Microsoft is apparently gearing up to release new smartphones and what could be the Lumia 750 or Lumia 850 just got certified in China.. While Nokia released a number of Lumias each year, we've seen significantly fewer Lumia handsets since Microsoft took over. The latest ones to hit the scene were the high-end Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL, followed by the Lumia 550 that arrived as the cheapest Windows 10 smartphone .. Nevertheless, Microsoft is expected to launch more smartphones soon as more information has now surfaced. After the Lumia 650 passed through the FCC , another unannounced smartphone is now edging closer to being released.. As ITHome reports ( via NokiaPowerUser), a new handset with model number RM-1182 has now received certification in China, after passing the same scrutiny in Indonesia. 28, 2015, and the handset seems to have support for China Unicom WCDMA.. ITHome suspects that this RM-1182 smartphone from Microsoft is the Lumia 750, which is expected to arrive as a mid-range offering. However, the handset could also turn out to be the Lumia 850.. Based on previous rumors, the Lumia 750 is expected to come with a full HD display measuring about 5.4 inches and pack a Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 processor with 2 GB of RAM. It remains unclear whether it will have a polycarbonate body or a more premium metal build like the one seen in the Lumia 650 live photos that leaked recently.. The Microsoft Lumia 850 (Honjo) , meanwhile, is rumored to have a larger full HD display of 5.5 or 5.7 inches and a Snapdragon 615 or 617 processor. The handset could support the neat Continuum feature of Windows 10 Mobile, but that depends on the rest of the specifications.. It's all in the rumor state at this point, but the Lumia 750 or Lumia 850 could turn out to be a more affordable alternative to the high-end Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL, launching alongside the more modest Lumia 650 (RM-1152).. Microsoft could unveil its latest Windows 10 handsets next month at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2016, which takes place on Feb. In the meantime, take everything with a grain of salt..

> Mobile World > Rumours about mobile phones. The mid-range smartphone comes with Windows 10 Mobile. Microsoft Lumia 850 Launching on January 12 - Report. Decent specs for a mid-range phone. We've known for a while that Microsoft plans to launch a few mid-range smartphones, but we didn't expect it to happen so soon.. According to a new report coming from NPU , Microsoft intends to unveil its first Windows 10 Mobile for 2016 on January 12.. We said earlier today that Microsoft might start the Windows 10 Mobile rollout on the same date. Both rumors seem to come from the same source, so there's no telling whether or not they are reliable.. Even if the Lumia 850 will not be announced in less than two weeks, Microsoft is expected to launch at least one mid-range smartphone in Q1 2016.. The Lumia 650 is another affordable Windows 10 Mobile handset that's likely to make its debut in the coming months if Microsoft doesn't have second thoughts.. Some information about Lumia 830's sequel already leaked online, along with some press renders that show what the smartphone might look like.. The rumor mill states that Microsoft's Lumia 850 will boast a massive 5.7-inch capacitive touchscreen display that supports full HD (1080p) resolution.. Also, the word is the smartphone will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 processor, but there was no mention of memory, so we will have to wait and see until Microsoft announces it.. One last piece of information we have about the Lumia 850 is that it might pack a front LED flash or an iris scanner for Windows Hello feature.. If you're thinking about the phone's looks, we've already attached a press render of the smartphone that leaked a while ago. It's also worth mentioning that the Lumia 850 could measure 155.90 x 77.23 x 6.92 / 8.50 mm.. Naturally, the Lumia 850 will be the fourth smartphone to come with Windows 10 Mobile operating system right out of the box, after Lumia 550, Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL.. # Microsoft Lumia 850 # Windows 10 Mobile # Lumia 850 # Microsoft Lumia # Lumia 650.

Microsoft Lumia 850: Purported Photos, Specs, Color Schemes Including Gold, Rose Gold Leaked. By Pavithra Rathinavel On 12/14/15 AT 2:47 AM. Microsoft's Lumia 850 is believed to come in four different color combinations, including that of Gold and Rose Gold. Latest leak points to a slew of brilliant photos, color schemes and specifications of the upcoming Microsoft Lumia 850 smartphone.. Credible tipster Evan Blass of @evleaks fame says, the mid-ranger Lumia 850 has been codenamed “Honjo.” The image leaked by him shows the handset in pristine white color with a flashy Microsoft logo implanted at the rear.. The icing on the cake, however, is the front-facing flash to capture killer selfies. While predecessor Lumia 830 came with sharp corners, the live image of successor shows rounded edges. In many ways, the exterior design resembles the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL, according to GSM Arena.. Going by the leaked images, Microsoft has removed the conventional capacitive keys under the display and the physical shutter button has no place either. Meanwhile, another GSM Arena report citing Baidu said. the upcoming Lumia 850 will have four color schemes.. The traditional white and black colored front and black panels will be accented with a combination of gold , rose gold, steel and copper frames. To be specific, the devices with white panels will apparently get gold or rose gold accents, whereas the black shelled variants will flaunt copper-colored sides or a plain steel accompaniment.. Furthermore, earlier reports pointed to a 5.0-inch display, HD resolution, Snapdragon 410 processor, 1 GB of RAM and 10-megapixel. PureView camera as the Lumia 850 specifications. But now, according to the new report, the upcoming mid-ranger will carry a 5.7-inch display, aided by a Full HD resolution.. Under the hood, the smartphone will reportedly be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 617 SoC. Comparing the two versions of rumor and taking the predecessor Lumia 830 into account, it’s easy to say the recent report looks like the real deal. In any case, readers are advised to take the rumored Lumia 850 specifications with the proverbial pinch of salt as Microsoft has not confirmed any details thus far.. Here is the purported image of the Lumia 850 in white color:. &mdash; Evan Blass (@evleaks) December 12, 2015. Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily..

Microsoft Lumia 850 Design Tipped by Leaked Cases. Gadgets 360 Staff , 30 December 2015. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. After launching its Lumia 550, Lumia 950, and Lumia 950 XL smartphones, Microsoft seems to be working on its Lumia 850 handset. Few leaked images showing handset's protective cases have emerged online, giving us some idea on the design of the device.. The images shared by Gizmochina ( via GSMArena) show the handset to house a rear camera at the top-centre position with single LED flash placed above it. The power button and volume buttons are seen on the right panel of the smartphone. In addition, the handset in the images is seen in its Blue colour variant. Since it is covered by a protective case, nothing more can be said for the Lumia 850 as of now.. Based on previous rumours, the Windows 10-based Lumia 850 is said to feature a metal frame. It is expected to house a 5-inch 768x1280 pixels resolution display, 10-megapixel rear camera with Zeiss lens, Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 SoC, 1GB RAM, 16GB inbuilt storage, and a 2650mAh battery.. We first heard about the unannounced Lumia 850 smartphone back in July when Microsoft alongside the Lumia 650 was reportedly testing it. Notably, the Lumia 650 showed up in another leak earlier this month.. It is worth mentioning that Microsoft Chief Marketing Officer, Chris Capossela last week in an interview hinted that the company is working on a high-end smartphone - anticipated to be the much-rumoured Surface Phone. He confirmed that the Redmond-based giant is working on a "breakthrough" phone that will be the "spiritual equivalent" of the company's Surface tablet line. He added however that the company still needed time to build the device, so asked for patience from interested users..

Leaker OnLeaks has posted only some photos and a video showing what he calls Lumia 850, a new mid-range device running Windows 10 Mobile, which could be launched in the coming months..
