Micromax Canvas 2 Q4310 has some strong pros and some strong cons. Therefore, it can't be considered a well-balanced phone. Let us have a look at the advantages. It comes with a corning gorilla glass 5 protector which is latest in 2017 market. Then there is fingerprint sensor, 3 GB RAM, 4G network support and 13 MP primary camera. These can be considered as some fine premium features. But on the other hand, battery is giving only up to 11 hours (3G) talk-time. Which is pretty low comparing to many phones from other brands in this price range. Generally speaking, battery backup is the biggest issue in a Micromax smartphone. Almost all of their smartphones have poor battery backup which highly discourages a customer to consider a phone. Then there is a 5 inch HD display with plastic body. Which doesn't really fit with Gorilla Glass 5 feature. A larger display with full HD quality or metal body would have been much interesting and useful. Then there is the 5 MP front camera which is pretty average quality and available in phones that costs from 6k. 32 GB ROM would have been much more suitable with 3 GB RAM. But it offers only 16 GB ROM. The graphics could be Mali T800 up for this price and OTG is also missing. Overall, the phone is quite ok altogether for the price. But it is missing good market insight and the focus on customers needs.. User Rating: 2.44 ( 14 votes). Micromax Canvas 2 Q4310 Rating by MobileDokan.
