The Meizu M5s features a 5-inch IPS display with HD resolution, 1.3GHz octa-core processor, 3GB of RAM and 16 gigs of expandable storage. There is a 13-megapixels camera with PDAF on the back, as well as a 5-megapixels front snapper. The phone is powered by 3000 mAh battery and runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow.. OS: Android (6.0), Meizu Flyme UI. Dimensions: 5.83 x 2.85 x 0.33 inches (148.2 x 72.5 x 8.4 mm). Weight: 5.04 oz (143 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Octa-core, 1300 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 7.

Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Unlike virtually every Western smartphone manufacturer, Meizu has long delivered ultra-affordable smartphones with surprisingly few compromises. While the company has been no stranger to controversy with Apple-esque designs , alleged patent infringement , and benchmark cheating , it’s difficult to dismiss the amount of value Meizu brings to the table.. As a sequel to the M3 series, the M5 series looks quite promising on the surface. For just around $100, it appears that you can get a well-built, reasonably functional smartphone. So, does this perception reflect reality? If yes, are Meizu’s offerings superior to the competition? Let’s find out in our comprehensive review of the Meizu M5, M5s, and M5 Note!. Before we delve into our review, we wanted to quickly make note of our composite approach. Yes, this is indeed a single review of three distinct smartphones: the Meizu M5, M5s, and M5 Note. Admittedly, there are some differences between these models, some more significant than others. In order to reduce confusion and ensure a continuous tone, this review will balance the critiques of each of the three. Please feel free to let us know your thoughts on this style in the comment section at the very end of this review.. The Meizu M5s and Meizu M5 Note follow Meizu’s standard design language. That is to say that they feature somewhat boxy, premium metal shells with deliberate antenna lines and craftily chamfered edges. The M5 Note is without plastic top and bottom caps, but otherwise is simply a slightly larger version of the M5s.. Meizu was able to deliver premium hardware at a fraction of the cost of the competition. Thus, the physical aspects of the M5s and M5 Note are pretty much identical. While you could certainly argue that these designs are derivative, it remains quite impressive that Meizu was able to deliver such premium hardware at a fraction of the cost of the competition. The relative scratch resistance, cleanly and consistently machined edges, and tactile power and volume buttons are all features that we wish we’d see more of in this price category.. Presumably to cut down on costs, the cheapest model of the trio, the Meizu M5, features a cheaper matte plastic design. While not as premium, the M5’s design is still quite nice. The build quality isn’t quite on par with the others, but it’s still a bit more than we expected at this price.. The M5 is the most ergonomic of the bunch. Plus, I personally found the M5 to be the most ergonomic of the bunch. The M5s and M5 Note are nice to hold, sure, but the M5 has more extreme curves. Combined with its smaller size, it’s no wonder why it stands out amongst the others.. Across the board, we have one minor complaint. The power and volume buttons are placed closely together; a lack of tactile differentiation on the power button sometimes made it difficult to find the correct button without fumbling around. This didn’t break the experience by any means, but it’s something that we wish Meizu will consider for future models.. Perhaps the most iconic design feature here is Meizu’s mTouch navigation system. Rather than following the herd of Android manufacturers following the standard three-key navigation system, Meizu has developed their own single-key solution.. Multitasking is handled beautifully without any keys. Multitasking is handled beautifully without any keys; you can simply swipe up from the bottom to quickly lock or close any open apps. Combined with Meizu’s smooth animations, this gesture feels surprisingly natural in practice.. The two most common functions – home and back – are cleverly implemented into the single physical button. You simply tap to go back and press to go home. Although this implementation can certainly take a day or two to get used to, you’ll very likely find yourself missing it when returning to other Android devices.. To sweeten the deal, the single button also functions as a fingerprint reader. It’s not the fastest or most accurate reader in the world, but it gets the job done. And, for this price, that’s all you can really ask for.. Meizu has taken a logical approach to the displays of the M5 series. The lower-end M5 and M5s feature small 5.2-inch displays, each with resolutions of 720p. The still low-end but ever so slightly more premium M5 Note, however, features a standard 5.5-inch 1080p display.. It seems that Meizu has designed the M5 Note with the heavy content consumer in mind, as its display is not only larger and of higher-resolution, but is also of higher quality. The M5 Note’s display is noticeably better than both the M5s’ and the M5’s; colors are reproduced more accurately and there’s a greater amount of contrast.. We're disappointed in the sunlight readability of all three models. The displays on the M5s and M5 are still acceptable, but they’re nothing to write home about. While we understand the need to cut costs, we’re disappointed in the sunlight readability of all three models. You definitely won’t be able to comfortably use these phones on sunny days.. There is some good news though. Unlike some competing options, the M5 series includes a standard oleophobic coating. This coating is often taken for granted, despite being very important for a “real glass” feel. We also didn’t notice any scratches on our units after a few weeks of use. These detailed attributes might sound small, but they really can make or break the overall experience.. To put it quite frankly: Meizu skimped on performance for each of the M5 devices. The phones are noticeably slow even when doing simple tasks like launching apps. We suppose that you might be able to get used to this over time. If you’re coming from an even slightly more expensive device, though, you’ll find these devices a bit poky.. When taking a look at the spec sheet, it becomes evident why this is the case. Although the series is being powered by octa-core Mediatek processors, each of the utilized processors are old, low-end chips. The selection process seems random at best.. The M5 uses the one-year-old MT6750, while the M5s uses the two-year-old MT6753, while still the M5 Note uses the one-and-a-half-year-old MT6755 (otherwise known as the Helio P10). It feels like Meizu is simply clearing stock of their old processors with these units given their inconsistent yet consistently poor choices.. These phones simply aren't intended for high performance tasks like gaming. It’s crucial to recognize that these phones simply aren’t intended for high performance tasks like gaming. If you’re looking for better performance at this price, you’ll want to look at phones that utilize Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors instead. The Snapdragon 430, in particular, is superior to all that’s here.. As is standard with Chinese smartphones, each of the M5 devices are unlocked and dual-SIM. Although there is support for 4G LTE in official markets, support in Western markets is limited. For example, you’ll be limited to 3G if you try to use these phones in the United States. We recommend steering clear if you live in or travel to Western countries like the US, as the inability to connect to 4G LTE networks is a massive drawback in this day and age.. Some may grumble about the 16 GB of storage on each of the base variants, but we feel that the added support for microSD card expansion makes up for this, given the pricing strategy. While you do have to give up one of the SIM card slots in order to make it work, Meizu has given more flexibility than we expect at this price.. Although none of the Meizu M5 models support 802.11ac, each includes support for 5 GHz Wi-Fi. There’s also support for Bluetooth 4.0. During my time with these devices, I did not notice any signal issues. This is important because some manufacturers use lower quality antennas, which causes reduced signal levels. Fortunately, that does not appear to be the case here.. You'll want to stick to external audio with these phones. The built-in speakers vary in quality, with the M5 Note having the best speaker of the bunch and the M5s having the worst speaker of the bunch. With that said, even the M5 Note’s speaker sounds tinny and distorted. Basically, you’ll want to stick to external audio with these phones.. We were quite frankly expecting more from these phones during our testing, given their low-end processors and low-resolution displays. Please understand that our testing numbers overestimate actual battery life, since our testing was performed over 3G rather than 4G LTE, as the phones are not compatible with 4G LTE in the United States.. With that out of the way, I found the Meizu M5’s battery life to be just about average. I received around five and a half hours of screen on time over about thirty hours of use. That’s fine for a 3,070 mAh battery, I guess.. The M5s’ 3,000 mAh battery did slightly worse, lasting for around the same time but with about four and a half hours of screen on time. I find those numbers to be a bit disappointing, but nothing I couldn’t live with.. Strangely, the M5 Note, with the biggest battery of them all at 4,000 mAh, fared the worst. With the same type of usage, I was only getting around three hours of screen on time with a mere twelve hours of use. There was even a day when the phone died after eighteen hours with just one and a half hours of screen on time.. We suspect that there is a bug relating to “system service,” as it routinely uses a substantial amount of power, even when the phone is locked. If you were hoping to use the M5 Note for watching videos, you might want to think twice as you’ll really struggle to keep this phone alive with even light-to-moderate usage.. The decision to stick with microUSB seems a bit misguided at this point. The decision to stick with microUSB seems a bit misguided at this point, given the widespread adoption of USB Type-C. To be fair, much of the competition has not made the transition either, so we’ll let you decide whether this is a plus or a negative. At least you won’t have to buy new cables if you’re upgrading from a legacy device.. The Meizu M5, M5s, and M5 Note all include 13 MP f/2.2 rear cameras and 5 MP f/2.0 front cameras. Although it appears that each phone’s camera delivers different results, we noticed a few common themes when looking at our camera sample images.. Across the board, each phone struggled with dynamic range. As you can see in the images below, capturing buildings and the sky proved challenging, as the cameras could not properly capture both the highlights and the shadows. There’s also a noticeable lack of contrast, making photos look “flat” and sometimes lifeless compared to the actual scenes. To top it off, images were soft and lacked detail.. The Meizu M5’s camera sits somewhere between the M5s and M5 Note in terms of quality. While it generally does an okay job, it tends to underexpose and reproduce colors as overly warm. While it’s certainly possible to get a decent shot with the M5, it offers nothing more than we expect at this price.. Despite its higher cost, the M5s actually performed worse than the M5 in our testing. As you can see in the images above, the M5s had especially poor dynamic range. This made it extremely difficult to capture photos outdoors, as the phone oftentimes couldn’t properly expose entire scenes. There’s also a bit of noise in some of these photos, which surprised us given the amount of light available while shooting.. The camera on the Meizu M5 Note performed better than the others, but not by much. Although there are some images that you’d probably never guess came from a $130 phone, many of the problems with the other models are also present here. Not only does the M5 Note also have a hard time with dynamic range, but it also incorrectly assessed focus on multiple occasions. Combined with largely hit or miss colors, and you’re left with a shooting experience that doesn’t really punch above average.. Each of these devices can capture 1080p video at 30fps, and we’ve included a sample clip captured with the M5 Note in our video review. To see the video for yourself, simply scroll to the top of this page.. The software aspect of the shooting experience remains the same from previous Meizu devices. As we have stated before, Meizu’s camera app is expectedly quite nice. There’s a nice amount of control, but enough balance to make it easy for a beginner to use.. Thankfully, the M5, M5s, and M5 Note each run the same software out of the box: Meizu’s Flyme 5 on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Meizu’s software has been some of our favorite in the past, so it adds a nice touch to the overall experience. Flyme is intentionally and radically different from stock Android, but that doesn’t mean it’s inherently bad.. Flyme offers a truly great core experience, even for foreigners. It’s Meizu’s design work and desire to simplify the user experience that makes Flyme such a pleasure to use day-to-day. The animations are thoughtful, the UI colors are punchy, and a special balance between customization and ease of use is achieved. Flyme offers a truly great core experience, even for foreigners.. Sadly, global firmware isn’t updated as frequently as Chinese firmware, so these models are still stuck on Flyme 5, even though Meizu has released Flyme 6 for the Chinese models. When we first started our testing, too, the M5 Note’s firmware had a few major bugs. Thankfully, those were ironed out with an update. However, it still raises concern as to how committed Meizu is to its global users.. The trouble for global users continues with how Flyme works with Google. Meizu does not have an official partnership with Google, which means that they are not allowed to offer Google apps and services on their smartphones. In order to appeal to global users, Meizu uses unauthorized methods to install and run Google apps and services.. While this approach works, there are some issues to be aware of. Undelivered Hangouts notifications, incompatibility with some apps like Android Pay, and general quirkiness are sadly part of the Meizu experience. You’ll also have to install Google apps using a separate installer app, as Meizu cannot preinstall the apps themselves. We hope that Meizu will take steps towards making an official relationship with Google possible in the future, as it would drastically improve the global user experience.. You’ll also want to keep in mind the update situation. Although Flyme gets updated for a relatively long period of time, Android and security patches do not. That means that you won’t be receiving an Android Nougat update anytime soon, let alone an Android O update. This isn’t unusual at this price, but it’s something to keep in mind.. The Meizu M5, M5s, and M5 Note are now available in China. If you’re in an unofficial market, you can import each device, but will likely face slightly higher prices. Please keep this in mind before making any big decisions.. The Meizu M5 is available in two variants, one with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of storage for 699 yuan (â$100) and the other with 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage for 899 yuan (â$130). The available colors are blue, black, and gold.. The Meizu M5s is also available in two variants, one with 3 GB of RAM and 16 GB of storage for 799 yuan (â$115) and another with 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage for 999 yuan (â$145). The available colors are silver, gunmetal, gold, and rose gold.. The Meizu M5 Note is available in three variants, one with 3 GB of RAM and 16 GB of storage for 899 yuan (â$130), another with 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage for 999 yuan (â$145), and another with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage for 1499 yuan (â$215). The available colors are silver, gunmetal, and gold.. Meizu has once again developed super affordable smartphones with few compromises for its target audience. With premium hardware, software that punches above its weight, and detailed additions like fingerprint readers, it’s no wonder why Meizu continues to find success in this price segment. The amount of value offered by these smartphones cannot be understated when viewed within a vacuum.. However, competition exists and Meizu’s offerings don’t do much to stand out from the crowd. While it’s great to have options, we do not recommend these devices for Western users. The global software quirks, poor performance, and inconsistent battery life are major drawbacks, even for around $100.. Meizu's offerings don't do much to stand out from the crowd. If you’re looking for a device on the cheap, you should instead consider Xiaomi’s budget Redmi 4 , Redmi 4a , and Redmi Note 4. While we are quite frankly not in a position to speak on how Meizu’s offerings compare to Xiaomi’s in official markets, we can say for certain that Xiaomi’s options provide an objectively better experience for global users. If you’re in the US, you’ll want to instead consider options that fully support US cellular networks.. You’ve made it to the end of our review of the Meizu M5, M5s, and M5 Note. We hope that this helps you make a more informed purchasing decision. If you plan on picking up one of the phones covered in this review, be sure to let us know in the comment section below!.

The M5s is akin to the M5 in lots of ways, but the choice of materials and chipset are not among those.. Meizu has chosen a premium metal build for the M5s, while the M5 was keeping the budget low with a plastic shell. Oddly, the company has demoted the MT6750 chipset down to the MT6753 (don't mind the numbers), which powered the m2 note back in mid-2015.. We appreciate the M5s metal body, and we'd sure take its exterior over the M5's. But the MT6753 chip is the elephant in the room and addressing it will be a lot more challenging that picking metal over plastic.. The Meizu M5s receives our shorter review treatment, though we are not dropping our long articles, so don't panic. Our goal is to give you our impressions in a concise manner, but without sacrificing the performance assessment and the results from the full tests, we normally perform. Meizu M5s has the same dimensions as the M5, but it has gained 5g courtesy of its new anodized metal body. The design takes after the already available Meizu M5 Note, and if it weren't for the small difference in display size, it would have been hard to tell those two apart.. The retail package of the Meizu M5s is basic - there is a microUSB cable and a charger plug but no headphones.. The real surprise here is that Meizu ships the M5s with a fast charger, which is a rarity in this price range. The bundled charger provides up to 24W of power (it can work at 5V/2A, 9V/2A and 12V/2A), which is incredibly high, but according to Meizu, the phone's charging maxes out at 18W (which is still as fast as Qualcomm's QuickCharge 3.0). The fast charging tech inside the Meizu M5s is proprietary and not Mediatek's Pump Express Fast Charging.. Meizu M5s and its retail box. The M5s returns to the made-of-metal league and the metal back is welcome. We see the mandatory antenna strips, which are made of plastic, but they blend in quite nicely with the rest of the matte surface. Finally, we like the glossy silver lines emphasizing the antenna borders even though we've seen those on quite a few phones already so they've turned into a bit of a design cliche already.. The glass with 2.5D edges covering the front makes for an upmarket look and feel. The 5.2" screen has an IPS LCD panel with 720p resolution, and that amounts to a pixel density of 287ppi. Its viewing angles are excellent - wide and with no color distortion, while its sunlight legibility is about average with a score of 2.580.. The 5.2" display has a maximum brightness of 407nits and an average contrast of 1:955. The color rendering is mediocre - the average deviation in color accuracy is DeltaE 7.3 and playing with the color settings won't help you achieve much better.. The mTouch key is what easily becomes a favorite feature in any recent Meizu smartphone. It's an all-in-one button with three functions - tap for Back, click for Home, and there is an embedded fingerprint scanner for when the screen is locked. Even though the biometric sensor isn't on when the screen is off, it's very fast, accurate, and is capable of recognizing your fingerprint from any direction.. The M5s is powered by a 3,000 mAh battery - about the same capacity as the cell inside the Meizu M5. The M5s scored a mediocre 56-hour endurance rating in our battery test, considerably down from the 76h score we recorded with the M5 and the relatively poor performance in standby is to blame.. Unlike the regular model, the new "s" comes with Meizu's mCharge solution, which in our tests filled up 45% of the battery capacity in 30 minutes even though Meizu claims a slightly faster charging speed. The supplied charger is a 24W one, but Meizu claims the phone can only charge with up to 18W of power.. Meizu M5s is a dual-SIM phone, but it uses a hybrid slot so you would have to make the choice of using either a second SIM or a microSD card.. The phone can come with either 16GB or 32GB storage capacity - getting the higher capacity would allow you to skip using the microSD card so you can slot in a second SIM card without any worries.. The SIM tray is on the left  the SIM/microSD hybrid slot  the bottom  the microUSB port. Finally, the bottom of the M5s is where the audio jack, the microUSB connectivity port, and the loudspeaker are. The primary mic is also around.. The M5s speaker scored a Good mark in our loudness test, less than a decibel short of the Very Good achievement. Subjectively, it doesnt sound particularly good at all - it's better than the M5 but worse than the M5 Note.. Meizu M5s specification User opinions and reviews Review comments (16).

Hands on with the Meizu M5s - an affordable alternative to the iPhone 6. | March 1, 2017 -- 17:16 GMT (01:16 GMT+08:00). Micro USB not USB C charging cable. The M5s was released in February 2016 as an 'affordable and intuitive stylish mid-end device'. It certainly looks more than mid-end to me.. At first glance, the packaging is similar to the M3Max and M5 Note I tested recently and strongly reminded me of the iPhone unboxing experience.. At 5.2 inches, the M5s has a a smaller HD screen than the Pro 6 Plus and the M5 Note. Resolution is less than the M5 Note at 1280 x 720 - due to its smaller screen - but the IPS display is crisp and sharp across a wide view angle.. The '2.5D' curved glass edges give the device a nice feel. It has an eye-care protective mode to help reading in low light and dark environments.. Like all Meizu phones, the M5s three piece metallic body is made from aluminium alloy, using CNC fabrication (computer controlled laser assisted cutting). The phone is available in grey, silver, champagne gold and rose gold.. Inside, there is a 64-bit 8-core MT6753 processor with 8 x ARM cores of A53 1.3GHz, ARM Mali-T720 GPU, and 3GB LPDDR3 memory. The phones are available in either 16 or 32Gb internal storage which is extendable to 128Gb with a micro SD card.. I loved how fast this phone charges. In fact, all of the Meizu phones I have tested seem to quickly charge. The M5s has mCharge technology which charges the battery '60 percent faster than the industry average' according to Meizu.. I noticed that from completely flat the 3000mAh battery charged to 100 percent within a couple of hours - if I used the correct Meizu micro USB charging cable that came with the device.. Meizu say that at a peak power of 18W it takes 30 minutes to charge the battery from 0 percent to 56 percent. It took me over an hour to charge the phone to 56 percent.. To be fair, I was using another charging cable to charge and got to 20 percent before I realised my error. Like the Pro 6 Plus, there are a range of battery saving options in the Flyme OS to extend battery life.. I found the phone lasted for days on a single charge when using apps. I could start multiple apps without any overhead. GPS does drain the battery more quickly, but I did not feel that this was an issue on this model.. This phone has a 13 megapixel, ƒ/2.2 aperture, Sony PDAF image sensor for high speed auto focus, with a 5 element lens rear camera.. It has a 5 megapixel ƒ/2.0 aperture 5-element lens front facing camera. These specs are higher than the more expensive Pro 6 plus I reviewed last month.. Picture quality is excellent and the inbuilt level gauge is really useful. The camera can also be accessed by swiping up from a corner of the lock screen which is handy when you are in a hurry to take that shot. Like other phones from the Meizu stable, the M5s has an ArcSoft beautification algorithm (to slim your face and make your eyes larger), and Face AE smart facial brightness adjustment.. Fingerprint recognition is fast at 0.2 seconds and recognises up to five different fingerprints. I now never need to use the unlock code on these phones as fingerprint recognition on the phone is so fast.. I had concerns that with a smaller phone, the audio would be as quiet as the M5 Note seemed to be but I was pleasantly surprised.. This phone is as loud as the Pro 6 Plus. I can hear the phone when I am outside the car. Music is clear and loud. I am very impressed that such a small device packs such a sound punch.. The Flyme OS build is 5.2 running on Android OS version 6, which was patched in January. Its 'Hot apps' icon enables you to download the apps of your choice - including Google Services and the Google Play Store.. Meizu says it has released almost 30 smartphone models across the PRO, MX and M-series and sold 22 million smartphones worldwide in 2016.. With the M5s the company has delivered a credible, affordable phone that has not compromised on performance. I have been impressed with the build quality on each phone, and the Flyme OS improves with each new model.. I like the feel of the case, and the laser cut holes for the microphone and speaker feel sharp and well made. The curve of the screen makes this look like an expensive phone and the solid build quality feels really good.. I was a little disappointed that the charging cable was Micro USB and not USB C. This is not a huge problem, but device manufacturers seem to be moving to USB C, and it is already standard on the Pro 6 Plus.. I think that if you are looking for a premium smartphone at an affordable price, then the M5s gives you the look and feel of a top-end phone but at a little over $200, you will have cash to spare..

Meizu M5s Review: Metal Meets Budget. April 28, 2017 - Written By Alexander Maxham. Meizu has put together a pretty good package at an affordable price in the M5s.. The Meizu M5s is the latest “budget” smartphone from the Chinese manufacturer, and it comes in at under $100 USD (when converted from Chinese Yuan). Smartphones in this price range typically aren’t that spectacular, and lack a lot of the bells and whistles. Meizu has opted to put in some pretty decent specs in the M5s, and also keep with their trademark metal build. Which is a bit unbelievable for its price. So are there any hidden surprises in the Meizu M5s? Let’s find out.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. Meizu has slapped a 5.2-inch 1280×720 resolution display on the M5s. With it being a 720p resolution panel, you’re looking at about 282 pixels per inch. The screen takes up about 69.4% of the front of the device. Inside, we have the MediaTek MT6753 processor which is an octa-core chipset clocked at 1.3GHz. This is paired with the Mali-T720MP2 GPU and 3GB of RAM. The M5s comes stock with 32GB of internal storage and there is a micro SD card slot inside for adding even more storage if needed.. The Meizu M5s has a 13-megapixel camera on the back, with phase detection autofocus and dual LED flash. It also sports an aperture of f/2.2. The front-facing camera is a 5-megapixel shooter at f/2.0. There’s a 3000mAh power pack embedded to keep the Meizu M5s going all day long, and it’s running on Android 6.0 with Flyme OS 5.2. There is a 3.5mm headphone jack included here, but no NFC. There is also Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, and we do also have a fingerprint sensor (which is also the home button). Finally, Meizu offers the M5s in Gray, Silver, Champagne Gold and Rose Gold.. In the box, you’ll find the Meizu M5s on top of course. Below that you’ll find some paperwork, a SIM ejection tool, a wall adapter and a micro USB to USB-A cable used for syncing and/or charging your M5s. So there’s really no surprises in the box here.. There’s no doubt about it, when it comes to smartphones in this price range, the Meizu M5s has the best build quality. Most smartphones at this price point are usually made of plastic, or faux metal. But Meizu has opted for a full metal unibody design here on the Meizu M5s which is great to see. On previous Meizu smartphones, they had been using a camera bump, like a lot of other manufacturers, but with the M5s, they opted to make it flush with the back of the device and make it a bit thicker for a larger battery. Which is something that we definitely do not mind seeing.. When it comes to the design here on the M5s, it does resemble other Meizu smartphones, and that’s not a bad thing. On the back you’ll see the camera is smack dab in the middle of the device, towards the top. There’s also the dual LED flash below it, and you’ll see two antenna bands at the top and bottom of the device. Now while it would look even cleaner without these, they do still look fairly minimal. On the right side, you’ll find the volume rocker with the power button below it. The left side houses the SIM card and micro SD card slot. It’s a hybrid tray so you can go dual SIM or micro SD and SIM card, but not both. The bottom has the speaker on the right side of the micro USB port and the microphone on the left. At the top you’ll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, something you don’t see on every smartphone these days.. The Meizu M5s definitely feels great in the hand. It’s thick, but not too thick, and despite it being metal it does have a decent amount of grip to it. Now it is still a tad bit slippery, but not as bad as some other metal smartphones on the market right now. With the display being a 5.2-inch measurement, the smartphone is still fairly small, so you are able to use it with one hand, and be able to reach the volume rocker and power button without having to readjust your hand.. There are a few things we’d change about the hardware here, but nothing that’s a deal breaker. The biggest one here being the fact that Meizu used a micro USB port as opposed to a USB-C port. While most other smartphones are going USB-C, it would have been great to see Meizu follow along, but again this is not a deal breaker. Otherwise, hardware is pretty impressive when you consider the price point of the M5s.. Let’s start this section off a bit different than usual. I had been using the Meizu M5s for about a week before I started writing this review. I thought that the display was a 1080p panel, before I looked up the specs to start writing this review. So the fact that this is actually a 720p display is pretty impressive. It shows that this display is actually pretty sharp, and looks great, which it does. It is an IPS LCD display, so it’s not as sharp outdoors as something with an AMOLED display, but it does still work quite nicely outside. The color temperature seems to be right on target on the M5s, for those that happen to care about that.. Smartphones this cheap typically come with a sub-par digitizer, as many manufacturers think that’s an area where they can save some cash. But, the digitizer on the Meizu M5s is actually top notch. For those that unaware, the digitizer is basically what sites below the screen and tells the system that you touched the display and where you touched it. So if you touch your display and nothing happens, it may not be because the phone is slow, but because the digitizer is slow. Luckily, that’s not an issue on the M5s.. An octa-core 1.3GHz processor along with 3GB of RAM doesn’t sound high-end, and well that’s because it isn’t. The Meizu M5s has what many would consider a “slow” processor, and that’s true. Even though it is crazy to think that a chipset clocked at 1.3GHz is “slow” in a smartphone. However, it is fast enough to do most general tasks. If you are browsing through Twitter, Instagram or any of your other favorite apps, it’s more than enough. Where things start to become a problem is actually when it comes to gaming. It can handle some gaming, but not all. Intensive games aren’t going to bode well on the M5s, but that is to be expected.. Now on the subject of RAM, 3GB is still plenty. While many high-end smartphones are coming out with 4GB or even 6GB of RAM included, that’s way more than you actually need. 3GB of RAM will be enough for mostly everyone, unless you’re planning on doing some virtual reality. During our testing, we found that 3GB of RAM was enough to keep apps in memory without having to have them redrawn later on when we opened them. We never ran out of RAM, nor had to close down everything to free some RAM and get better performance on the device.. As has been the case for about three years now with other phones, Meizu has placed a fingerprint sensor on the M5s, and it doubles as the physical home button. The fingerprint sensor continues to be lightning quick and accurate, which is no surprise coming from Meizu. Over the years, and the many, many reviews we’ve done on their products, we’ve found that their sensors are some of the best in the business, just behind Huawei who has the fastest fingerprint sensors currently. The sensor unlocks pretty instantly, within a second or two and was very accurate, we only noticed it not recognize our fingerprint a handful of times throughout a week of using the phone. That’s pretty incredible when you think about it.. Now the fingerprint sensor is part of the home button which is called mTouch. The home button is actually a back button as well. So you press the button to go home, and touch it to go back. This keeps the front of the M5s and other Meizu smartphones looking nice and clean by having one button instead of a physical button and two more capacitive keys. Definitely cool from a design perspective. But usability is the real issue, and luckily it works well here. As is always the case with smartphones that change the flow of things, it does take a few days to get used too, but once you get used to it, it’s pretty easy to use.. Meizu sells the M5s in Europe and in Asia, we have been testing the M5s in the US, but we also took it on a recent trip to Beijing so we were able to use it on T-Mobile USA and China Unicom. In the US, it worked about as we had expected, giving us up to HSPA+ speeds, no 4G LTE connectivity, which is typically how things go with smartphones that are not made specifically for the US. In China, we were able to get 4G LTE on China Unicom during our trip, and the speeds were pretty good. We had no real issues with Internet speeds whether on mobile or on Wi-Fi. You can see the bands it supports below.. When it came to phone calls, while the Meizu M5s does not support HD Voice or VoLTE, it does give you crystal clear voice, which is always important. We were able to call people with ease and not have any of our calls drop, nor did users on the other end have trouble hearing us. So for those that still make phone calls, there’s nothing to worry about here.. Meizu has added a speaker to the bottom of the M5s. It’s located on the right side of the micro USB port, with the left side just being a microphone, even though it looks like a speaker. This is done to make it look symmetrical, and is actually a pretty common practice among smartphones today. The speaker on the Meizu M5s is nothing to get too excited about. It is nice and loud, but it’s not going to win any awards for the audio that it outputs. The speaker surprisingly doesn’t sound tinny at all, which is definitely a good thing. Meizu has also kept the 3.5mm headphone jack here, which is nice to see, and that is located at the top of the device.. On the Meizu M5s, we ran AnTuTu, 3D Mark and Geekbench 4, to see just how well the internal hardware would do. And on AnTuTu, it scored a 35,924. Over on Geekbench 4, it picked up scores of 599 in the single-core test and a 1678 in the multi-score test while on 3D Mark it scored a 197. Now yes, these scores are quite low, but we also have to remember the hardware that is inside the Meizu M5s. We can’t expect it to put up scores close to the Galaxy S8, or even the LG G5 from last year, when it has a slower processor and less RAM. So given the internals here, the Meizu M5s actually performed quite well.. There’s a pretty hefty 3000mAh battery inside the Meizu M5s here. Which may seem like a standard sized battery these days, but remember that this is sporting a 1.3GHz processor and a 720p display, which is a recipe for great battery life. And that is definitely the case here with the Meizu M5s. It’ll last you all day long and then some. Now unfortunately, due to the way that Meizu reports battery stats in Flyme, we don’t have any screenshots of the full battery cycle, you can only see the last 3 hours, 6 hours or 12 hours. It’s a bit unfortunate, but it does still give you a good idea of how good or bad the battery might be. And in our case, it’s pretty darn good.. When it comes to charging, Meizu has their mCharge technology included, which can charge the Meizu M5s from 0 to 56% in about 30 minutes. However, this only works with the included charger. So if you do not use the included charger, you won’t see charging speeds that are that fast, unfortunately. During our testing, we weren’t using the included charger (since it’s an EU charger and we’re in the US), but it still charged somewhat fast with a regular charger.. At the time of reviewing the Meizu M5s, it’s running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, with Flyme 5.2.13 and the January 5th, 2017 security patch. Now yes, that security patch is a couple of months old, but it is still a “recent” patch, so that’s a good thing. However, it is unfortunate that it is still running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, when Android 7.0 Nougat has been out and available for nearly 8 months now. With Flyme being such a heavy skin, it does take Meizu a bit of time to incorporate it into their software and make sure everything is working, but that’s still some pretty old software.. Meizu’s Flyme OS is actually a pretty colorful skin. It’s one of my favorite skins in the Android world, despite it still having a few issues. The biggest issue is the fact that it still does not show Gmail notifications properly. Now this isn’t exclusive to Flyme, we’ve seen this with other Chinese smartphones (including Xiaomi’s smartphones with MIUI). What happens is the subject and the sender of the email in your notification is shown in black lettering, which makes it almost impossible to read in the notification shade. While the rest of that notification is shown in white or light gray. It should be a simple fix, but it’s something that has been part of Flyme for a few years now.. Onto the good of Flyme, though. Flyme, like many other Android skins out there, does have themes available. So you can download or use the existing themes to really customize your Meizu M5s. Now the theming engine isn’t as robust as what you see on the Galaxy S8 or LG G6, it basically just these wallpaper and home screen icons. But it is a nice feature to have. Smart Touch is a rather cool feature, although it’s hard to say how many people would find it useful. It basically adds a white dot onto your home screen, and by swiping in different directions you can do different tasks. For example, swiping down will open the notification shade. Swiping up will exit the app and go to the home screen and swiping left and right you can jump between your open apps. It’s an interesting feature, but maybe not a popular one.. Flyme, as always is full of features. Many of which are ones that not everyone will use, but it is nice to have it available. Flyme, as expected, works well on the Meizu M5s. While it looks like it is a pretty heavy skin, it’s actually not all that heavy. Considering an octa-core 1.3GHz processor with 3GB of RAM can run it quite smoothly.. Now it’s time to talk about the most important aspect of any smartphone, the camera. Before we jump into the pictures and picture quality, let’s talk about the camera experience. Meizu has always had a pretty decent camera app on their smartphones. It’s pretty minimal while still offering a great deal of features for their users. In the viewfinder, and this setup seems to be pretty common among most smartphones these days, you’ll find the mode selector, shutter button and gallery shortcut on the right side (when holding in landscape) and a few quick setting shortcuts on the left side. This includes things like filters, timer, and switching to the other camera. The modes included on the Meizu M5s camera are Auto, Manual, Video, Beauty, Panorama, Light Field, Slow-mo, Scan, Macro and GIF. The GIF mode is definitely a fun one to use. Now the scanning mode is also nice to have included, as it allows you to quickly scan a QR Code without opening another app. While QR Codes aren’t that popular in the western side of the world, it’s still hugely popular in Asia, where Meizu’s biggest markets are.. One of the downsides we do have to mention here with the Meizu M5s camera, and we do think this can be fixed with a software update, is the fact that if you use the camera in other apps, the camera stops working until you do a restart. For instance, if you try to use the camera in Instagram, or Twitter or Snapchat to take a photo, it will act like it has taken it (but it actually hasn’t) and then the camera will stay black. If you open the camera app, it’ll tell you that the camera is busy. The only way to get around this is by taking pictures in the camera app and then sharing it on other social media networks. It’s a bit of a nuisance, but that’s what has to be done for now.. When it comes to the picture quality of the Meizu M5s’ camera, it’s actually a bit surprising, and that’s in a good way. The camera takes some stunning pictures, considering the price of this phone and the fact that there is no laser autofocus – it does have phase detection autofocus though – the shutter is very fast and it focuses quickly. Color reproduction on the M5s is pretty good. The pictures aren’t overly saturated like some other cameras – namely Samsung’s smartphones – and the camera even performs somewhat decent in low-light. We took the M5s on a recent trip to Beijing and it performed pretty well. The camera even took some good shots outside at night, which is again, impressive for a camera on a smartphone in this price range. You can see all of the pictures we took with the Meizu M5s, unedited and in full resolution in the Flickr gallery below.. The Meizu M5s is a capable smartphone. It’s not the fastest, or the most high-end smartphone, but it is a more than capable smartphone. This is a smartphone that is aimed at those looking for a smartphone that can do things like check your email, browse social media a bit and most importantly make calls, while lasting them all day long. And the Meizu M5s excels at all of those tasks.. Should I buy the Meizu M5s?. Meizu’s M5s is priced at 999 Yuan (or RMB), which converted comes out to about €135 or $145 USD, putting it in the same place as the Moto G4 Play from last year. And the Meizu M5s definitely gives the Moto G4 Play a run for its money. The M5s is a great smartphone to pick up, if you’re not a heavy user, it will work perfectly for everything you want to do with this smartphone. And for $145, it’s hard to pass it up..

I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. Flyme lets you launch apps by drawing alphabets on the phone's screen when it's turned off. So you can have the phone launch the camera when you draw a C, or have it launch Instagram instead. You can swipe down from anywhere on the screen to bring the notification shade down. This is one shortcut that Samsung and iPhone still somehow don't let you do. They expect you to drag your thumb to the top of the display every time, which was okay in 2012 when phones all had 4-inch displays but dumb in 2017 when phones have 5- to 6-inch displays. Flyme comes with a very useful "Tools" app that turns the phone into a ruler, compass, spirit level, and currency converter.. Most importantly, the software is clean and light and doesn't break your push notifications like phones by Xiaomi, Huawei, Vivo, Oppo, Gionee, and every other freaking Chinese phone on the market.. Meizu M5s continues the company's singular design language.. Most people like Meizu phones because. they're premium-feeling metal unibody phones that sell at a very low price. Personally, I like them because Meizu's Flyme software is just about the cleanest Chinese Android skin on the market, and the engineers at the Zhuhai-based company developed a pretty clever way to navigate within the phone with just one button.. The company's first phone of 2017, the M5s, continues this trend. It's a sturdily-built metal phone that sells for just US$115. The specs on this is, as to be expected, on the budget phone tier: a. MediaTek MT6753 octa-core chip running on. 3GB of RAM and 16 or 32GB of ROM. And while the M5s can't hold a candle to Meizu's own flagship, the sturdy and powerful. Pro 6 Plus , it offers just enough that non-power users should be quite satisfied. And to be frank, nobody who buys a $115 phone as their daily driver is a serious/diehard/power Android user anyway.. An official product shot of the M5s.. 720p IPS LCD display isn't going to wow anyone who's looked at a quad HD AMOLED display (like on Samsung's Galaxy lines or Meizu's own Pro 6 Plus), but with a PPI (pixel-per-inch) of 282, it's still respectable and enough. The viewing angles on this panel, like all Meizu phones, are surprisingly great and at max brightness the display is perfectly legible even in the sun. There's a 2.5D slight curved on the front glass panel (not the display itself, just the bezels) that turns subtly into the chamfered edges. It's quite a premium feeling for a phone that is, again, ultra cheap.. Also punching above its pay grade is the charger included in the box, which is an 18-watt. plug that, when working in unison with Mediatek's own fast charge technology, can pump a lot of juice into the phone very quickly. During my tests, I was able to add 50% of power to the battery in a little under 30 minutes. This is very, very fast for a budget device.. On the back of the device is a. 13 megapixel, f/2.2 aperture camera, photo quality on this is good, not great. Color accuracy is high, and photos have a punchy high-contrast vibe (which I like), but there's a bit of noise in low light situations, and the photos don't capture as much fine details as a strong camera (like the Huawei Mate 9 Pro or iPhone 7 Plus). But then again, I'm comparing a $115 phone to a $800 phone here. I'll finish up with this before I move onto photo samples: the M5s has a very good camera if you factor in budget and compare to other mid-tier phones. A Galaxy S7 or iPhone 7 may take better photos than the M5s, but the quality bump is not proportional to how much more expensive those phones are.. The M5s take photos with very accurate colors.. Note the texture of the bagels are quite detailed here.. The camera focus is a bit slow, however.. And in low light, it really suffers. But then again, keep in mind this is a budget device.. The phone is capable of recording videos up to. 1080p, and again, the colors are accurate and the 30-fps holds up, but the audio recording is below par compared to my more expensive phones.. There's a single speaker at the bottom of the device that pumps out adequate sound.. Audio with headphones plugged in, however, sound a bit flat. One thing's for sure, that high quality DAC on the Pro 6 Plus isn't here.. A few months ago I called the Meizu M5 (not to be confused with this phone, the M5s) the best budget phone. That thing was $100, has mostly the same specs as the M5s, but has a plastic back. The M5s is basically a slight upgrade to a more premium metal build for the extra $15.. Personally, I don't mind the plastic back that much so I'd rather go for the M5, but some people really like that metal unibody look and feel.. The screen is bright and vibrant.. The phone is very fast and smooth when running everyday apps, but I found the graphics and performance during gaming hit-and-miss. That's likely due to the mid-tier Mediatek processor. The software is also a bit dated, as it's still running Android 6.0. At least the Flyme software here is pleasant as usual. I really like all the little shortcuts that Flyme offers, which I've explained in past reviews before. , but I'll give a quick TL;DR version here:. However, since the Android version here is so dated, a lot of useful features like split-screen mode and ability to respond to messages in the notification card are not here. Flyme does have its own split-screen mode ... that only works on two native Meizu apps.. The 3,000 mAh battery may be smaller than batteries on other phones, but when you consider the phone's small display (and one that's only at 720p), and the light software, then it becomes clear that the battery is more than enough for the M5s. I was able to get six hours of screen on time everyday, and the device lasted me through the entire day all week.. The M5s measures 5.83 x 2.85 x 0.33 in.. A few months ago I reviewed Meizu's M5, which I called the best budget phone. The M5s is very similar to the M5 in many ways, except it has a nicer, more premium metal build. Whether or not that is worth the extra 15 bucks is up to you. But even if the M5s doesn't overtake the M5 for the title, it's still a metal unibody phone that operates smoothly at just $115. Meizu's got this budget corner down, and its premium phones aren't too shabby either. If there's one nitpick, I'd say that Meizu's hardware is due for a makeover. 6th or 7th Meizu phone I've reviewed and they all look mostly the same, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but still. With Samsung, LG and Xiaomi pushing for the slim bezels wagon, and Gionee jumping on board too, it's time for Meizu to come up with a new look..

Meizu M5S Review: The Main Rival to Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X. 0 37 6 minutes read. Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn StumbleUpon Tumblr Pinterest Reddit VKontakte Odnoklassniki Pocket. Flyme 5.2 UI based on Android 6.0. Meizu has planned to launch a MT6753-powered smartphone in February, and it happened. The next phone should be equipped with a Helio X30, and it should be the Meizu Pro 7. But the latter is expected to hit the market only in June. This means we have to wait for 4 months before this manufacturer comes in with another device. So we have a lot of time to play with the Meizu M5S and find out what market it is designed for, and what selling points it has.. Buy Meizu Phone M5S for $149.99 from Banggood XiaomiToday Best Deals. The Meizu M5S was launched at the same time with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X and Motorola G5 Plus. All three phones are targeted for the mid-range market. Therefore, we can expect for a good combination of price and hardware / software. The Motorola G5 Plus doesn’t compete with these two models in Chinese and neighbor markets. So let’s forget about it for a moment. As for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X , we have learned much about it, and we know it is ready to beat all of its competitors. But Meizu is not one from those manufacturers that lay down their arms quickly.. Everything about the Meizu M5S hints we are dealing with a well-prepared device , which knows where it enters and what its mission is. But there are many features have to take a closer look at. So let’s start our Meizu M5S review .. Meizu held a press-conference on February 15, where it introduced the first phone of 2017 dubbed as the Meizu M5S. This is the next device from Blue Charm family. The standard version with a 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal memory was initially priced at 799 yuan ($116), while the 32GB version was announced at 999 yuan ($145). Thus we are dealing with a regular thousand-yuan smartphone designed for young customers.. The Meizu M5S comes with an 18W high-speed fast charge technology that charges the phone up to 56% in 30 minutes. This means Meizu brought the fast charging technology to the thousand-yuan devices. Therefore, other mid-range phones from this niche have a lot of things to think about.. Other than that, the Meizu M5S is thought to be a replacement to the Meizu M3S, though the most eye-catching change refers to the screen size.. The phone comes in a regular white box. There are no images on the package. So everything looks elegant, but the light colors hint this phone has been made for youth.. The back side of the box includes some standard information on the Meizu M5S such as memory, battery, model and so on.. Once the phone is opened we can see the phone matches the packaging size. Everything is compact and we won’t find any useless accessories and spaces.. The packaging includes the phone itself, cable, charger, pin, and a user manual.. This phone is compared with the Mieuz M3S due to a few features. First of them concerns the same metal housing. We have used to see metal body mainly on high-end devices. But Xiaomi and Meizu habituate us to require such a housing from low-end and mid-range phones. Moreover, metal housing doesn’t mean we are dealing with a piece of aluminum. Almost all models come with a finest appearance due to CNC crafting and 360 degrees of 3D sandblasting processes. Plus, the Meizu M5S has also passed anodizing treatment as well as laser engraving technology. So when holding the phone in hand we have a great feeling of ergonomics. Shortly, the Meizu M5S continues the best traditions of this family. So once you see it, you will identify Meizu’s handwriting at the first sight.. This phone is packed with a 5.2-inch 720P display with a wide viewing anlge of IPS technology. It also supports GFF display technology for sharper viewing experience. However, the pixel density is a bit disappointing – 282PPI. Even the 2.5D glass doesn’t save the situation – this is the main shortcoming of the phone.. Read Doogee Y6 Max 3D Review : 3D Home Theater In Your Pocket For $150 to find more about GFF technology.. The upper side of the front panel has to holes – one for the front camera, and the next one for the speaker. The sensors are hidden under the panel.. The bottom side carries only the elipse-shaped home button supporting mTouch technology. The button is made of glass. It is surrounded by a metal ring for reinforcement.. Read Meizu Has Granted mBack Patent to find more about the mTouch technology.. The back panel of the phone is made of metal, though the upper and lower sides are made of plastic. As Meizu has been always perfect in the level of technology, you won’t feel any color differences between them. Other than that, the T-like design make the phone to be great in terms of connectivity.. The rear camera at 13MP lens paired with a LED light is placed in the upper middle area. The camera comes with f/2.2 aperture and supports PDAF as well as autofocus.. The lower side comes with a small printing ‘Designed by Meizu LTE Mobile Phone Assembled in China’.. The power button along with the volume rocker are located on the right side.. The SIM card slot is placed on the opposite side.. It is divided into two slots – one of them can be used as a memory expansion up to 128GB. But if you refuse this option, you will access dual-SIM dual-standby option.. The 3.5mm audio jack is on the top.. While the microUSB port and two speakers are located on the bottom.. That’s not a secret young users are more obsessed with mobile phones. Therefore they need more power in their handsets than other users. That’s why battery capacity is one of the decisive features of the phones designed for this niche.. There are two ways to solve the problem related with the power. Manufacturers either pack their products with larger batteries or develop new technologies for faster charging. We know chip makers as well as smartphone manufacturers are working on newer technologies to save more power and to shorten the charging duration. As for the Meizu M5S, this phone comes with a charger supporting up to 18W fast charge technology allowing users to charge the phone up to 56% in 30 minutes. In this sense the slogan ‘Do not waste youth on charging’ is quite reasonable.. You may ask why other manufacturers do not bring 18W charging technology to their phones too. The reason is these chargers cost more. So manufacturers avoid it not to increase the phone pricing.. To understand what I am talking about let’s compare the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X with the Meizu M5S.. The test shows the M5S can be charged from 10% to full power in 100 minutes. Moreover, it will take about 10 minutes to charge to 19%, and 30 minutes to reach 50%.. As for the Redmi Note 4X, it will be fully charged in 140 minutes.. We have taken another test in order to learn how the phone will discharge. The game was played at 50% of screen brightness and the WiFi was on. As a result, the Meizu M5S drainages to 83% after 1.5 hours of playing. So the 3000mAh battery is enough for daily tasks.. Flyme has been always known as one of the simplest UIs. Meizu’s UI is easy to use and no one can argue this. The Meizu M5S comes with the latest Flyme 5.2 based on Android 6.0. Thanks to this OS the phone is capable of providing a stable performance regardless the list of new functions it runs on the background.. However, it’s expected the phone will get an OTA update soon replacing the current version with Flyme 6.0 OS.. At last, learn how the mBack works to ease your daily use.. The Meizu M5S sports a MediaTek MT6753 octa-core SoC clocked at 1.3GHz and paired with a Mali-T860MP2 GPU, 3GB of RAM and 16GB / 32GB of internal memory. It looks sufficient for a thousand-yuan smartphone. But let’s see what benchmarks show.. The Meizu M5S scored 38.018 at AnTuTu.. Read Top 10 Smartphones in January, 2017, according to AnTuTu .. The phone scored 199 points at 3DMark benchmark.. Probably, this is the second disappointing thing of the phone – it scored only 3094 at PCMark comprehensive performance test. But what’s worse, the CPU clocks at only 0.6GHz.. Geekbench 4 showed 615 at single-core test and 2106 at multi-core test.. But if ignoring all these benchmarks and focus on practice, the Meizu M5S runs smoothly and you can even play semi-heavy games without problems.. The phone comes with a 13MP camera at 5P lens, f/2.2 aperture, dual-tone LED flash, and PDAF phase support.. As for the front camera module, it comes at 5MP lens.. However, both cameras provide regular performance such as panoramic shooting, manual mode, slow motion, GIF animation and so on. But I guess most of you will use only the automatic mode. To check out how the rear camera shoots daytime take a look at the photo samples below.. And learn how it captures in the night.. As you can see, the lack of OIS and other demanded features affect the final result of the photos. For example, it’s very difficult to counteract the noise. On the other hand, let’s remember this phone is made for entry-level. In this sense, the camera performance is satisfactory.. The Meizu M5S is priced quite acceptable. Thanks to such a pricing it can compete in the entry-level market as well as mid-range market. However, there are not many selling points. The Meizu M5S’ key features are the metal housing and the fast charging technology. But what do young users need? I guess these two features are satisfactory for this kind of customers..
