CNET también está disponible en español.. Stuck between a good deal and a hard place. The Good The HTC U11 Life is like a cheaper Pixel 2 with its squeezable sides. It's attractive, affordable, fully water-resistant and has decent midrange specs.. The Bad Camera quality is hit or miss and battery life is on the short side.. The Bottom Line HTC's U11 Life is a decent midrange phone, but the Moto G5 Plus shoots better photos for a little less.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. The HTC U11 ( $629.00 at Amazon.com ) Life is caught right in the middle of being a great deal and not quite worth your time. For a fraction of the price of the full-size and fully-powered U11 , the smaller U11 Life has the same supple look in a beautiful blue body and the same squeezable sides as the U11 and Google Pixel 2 ( $639.99 at Amazon Marketplace ). Squeeze once to open an app and long-squeeze to open a second. It's a little gimmicky and easy to forget it's there, but if you start relying on it to open your favorite app, it can be a fast way to get to what you need.. Before we proceed, let me say that this review represents only the US version of the phone. The global version (at least the UK version) has a different operating system, RAM, storage and LTE bands. It also comes in black and white colors, in addition to blue.. This version of the U11 Life has some pretty good midrange specs, like a 16-megapixel front-facing camera, water resistance and a totally decent processor. There are some hardware and performance tradeoffs, sure, but that's pretty much always the case with a midprice phone.. Get an eyeful of the HTC U11 Life. It's a nice phone to grab up and looks flashier than a lot of intermediate phones out there. But it's not without its flaws, especially when it comes to the camera. Colors are bright and true-to-life, and photos looked sharp on the comparatively tiny screen. But when I viewed them on my laptop, they were so soft -- either blurred or lacking detail on the edges and centers -- that I figured the camera lens was smudged. Photos will be just fine for sharing in a small format, like a text message or on Instagram or Facebook, but I wouldn't plan on printing them in a photo book, calendar or gift mug.. Hold the U11 Life next to the Motorola Moto G5 Plus ( $209.99 at Walmart ) and the Life's camera weakness becomes clearer. While the G5 Plus doesn't hit color balance as faithfully, its 12-megapixel camera is more detailed; I compared 10 identical shots. The U11 Life does take notably sharper selfies from the front-facing camera, though, that make the G5 Plus' look like mush.. When you match up the camera quality and price, the U11 Life doesn't seem like such a slam dunk compared to the Moto G5 Plus. Pricing first, the U11 Life costs $349 from HTC.com, which converts to £263 and AU$456. T-Mobile is the exclusive US carrier; it'll sell the U11 Life for $300. The Moto G5 Plus, meanwhile, costs $229 or $300 (32GB or 64GB), £249 and converts to AU$300 and AU$390 in Australia.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

The unlocked U11 Life takes its design cues and many features from HTC's flagship phone and offers them for a midrange price.. The HTC U11 is one of the best phones we've tested this year, but at $649, it's expensive. At $349, the unlocked HTC U11 Life gets you many of the same features —including a waterproof design with a unique "squeeze" sensor, support for multiple voice assistants, and a pair of noise-canceling earphones —for nearly half the price. It isn't quite as powerful, and its screen isn't as sharp, but it's a solid buy for HTC fans on a budget. It comes close to nabbing our Editors' Choice for midrange phones, but Motorola's Moto X4 promises a superior dual-sensor camera, a longer-lasting battery, and broader carrier compatibility for just $50 more.. The U11 Life should look familiar if you've ever seen the U11. The two phones are practically identical, sharing the same general design with sleek curves and a shimmery, bright blue reflective body that's an absolute fingerprint magnet. The Life feels just as premium as the U11, though it's clad in cheaper acrylic rather than glass. Both stick to the traditional 16:9 aspect ratio, meaning there's a rather sizable bezel above and below the display.. View All 11 Photos in Gallery. The Life measures 5.9 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 5 ounces. It's similar in size and feel to the Moto X4 (5.8 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches, 5.7 ounces), but compared with tall-and-narrow phones like the Samsung Galaxy S8 (5.9 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces), it feels a bit wide. That said, it's easy enough to reach across with one hand, and won't feel like it's making your pocket bust at the seams.. The front is home to a 5.2-inch, 1,920-by-1,080 IPS Super LCD that works out to a crisp 424 pixels per inch, the same as the Moto X4. It's not quite as sharp as the Quad HD U11, but it still has well-defined text and graphics along with accurate colors. Viewing angles and outdoor visibility are good, though I would have liked the screen to be a tad brighter in direct sunlight.. There's a volume rocker on the right, above a ridged power button. The bottom has a reasonably loud speaker and an off-center USB-C charging port. The top features a SIM/microSD card slot that worked with a 256GB card. The sides are also where you'll find the "squeeze" sensor, like on the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. There's no visible indication of it, but it's toward the lower half of the phone, below the power button. You can program it to launch a certain function when you squeeze both sides, like the camera app or Amazon Alexa. It's a unique and useful way to interact with the phone, and it isn't easy to trigger by accident.. There's no headphone jack, so you need to use the included U Sonic earphones (which connect via USB-C) or a pair of Bluetooth headphones. No USB-C-to-3.5mm dongle is provided, and third-party dongles don't work. That's not a big drawback, as the included earphones are quite good. They use a sonar-like technology to map your hearing and create a personal audio profile, resulting in clearly defined highs and high-mids, as well as solid power in the lows. It also supports high-resolution audio playback and Bluetooth 5.0, letting you listen on two headphones simultaneously.. The phone is IP67 waterproof , allowing it to be immersed in roughly 3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes.. The Life is available unlocked for GSM carriers and supports LTE bands 1/2/3/4/5/7/12/13/17/20/28/66. That makes it ideal for AT&T and T-Mobile, the latter of which offers the phone directly with support for VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling. The Moto X4, meanwhile, also supports CDMA bands so it can work on Sprint and Verizon. I tested the Life on T-Mobile in midtown Manhattan and recorded a top download speed of 7.7Mbps and an upload of 19.2Mbps, indicating some network congestion.. Transmissions are clear, though somewhat on the harsh side. Earpiece volume is loud and noise cancellation is good at blotting out the majority of background sounds, so you shouldn't have trouble making calls in a busy environment.. Other connectivity protocols include dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz and 5GHz) and the aforementioned Bluetooth 5.0. There's also NFC, so you can use Android Pay.. The Life is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 processor and 3GB of RAM. In the AnTuTu benchmark, a measure of overall system performance, the phone scores 71,786, just slightly higher than the Moto X4 (70,353). Neither comes close to the Snapdragon 835-powered U11, but the Life is fast and smooth in regular use, has plenty of RAM for multitasking, and handles intensive games like GTA: San Andreas without much issue aside from the occasional dropped frame.. See How We Test Cell Phones. Battery life is a bit disappointing, though. With a capacity of just 2,600mAh, the Life scored 5 hours in our rundown test, in which we stream full-screen video over LTE at maximum screen brightness. That's much shorter than the Moto X4, which lasted for 7 hours and 45 minutes under the same conditions. Thankfully the phone has multiple power modes that let you save juice by dialing down screen brightness, connectivity, and performance. HTC's Sense Companion can identify apps that are draining your battery and recommend when it's time to turn on power saving (more on this in the Software section).. The Life has a pair of matching 16-megapixel rear and front cameras. Both take crisp shots outdoors and in good lighting, with accurate color reproduction. You also get manual controls, slow-motion video, and relatively stable 4K video recording at 30fps. But the Life struggles when it comes to low-light shooting. Compared with the Moto X4, the U11 doesn't capture as much light when taking pictures in auto mode, as you can see above. It also takes several seconds longer to focus, and it often produces muddy or blurry images indoors. The X4 also has more stable video recording.. The U11 Life comes running Android 7.1 Nougat with HTC's Sense UI skin on top. Sense is a distinctive UI layer in terms of app icons and menus. It also has features like Blinkfeed, a Flipboard-like newsfeed that appears when you swipe left from the home screen. But the most notable addition is HTC Sense Companion. It's an AI assistant that gives you suggestions based on your location and usage patterns.. This can include things like recommendations for nearby restaurants and local attractions, to reminders to charge your phone or turn on power-saving mode when you're running out of juice. It takes a little while to truly learn your usage patterns (a few weeks according to HTC), so I didn't get the full experience, but it did point out the power-saving features. I can see it being useful for new users.. Like the U11, the Life supports Amazon's Alexa voice assistant. You'll find it on the phone in the form of the HTC Alexa app, and from there you need to connect to your Amazon account. Alexa isn't always listening like it is on the Echo speaker, but you can get it to launch with a squeeze. Alexa didn't have any trouble responding to random queries or playing songs from some Spotify playlists.. There's some bloatware, but not a ton. You have a few HTC apps, as well as Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram. If you buy the phone from T-Mobile, you can expect to find a set of carrier apps as well. Out of 32GB of internal storage, the Life has 18.24GB available for use.. For $349 unlocked, the U11 Life is a solid midrange phone that offers many of the same features as the flagship U11 for a much more affordable price. It's a good choice for audiophiles and HTC aficionados. But for $50 more, the Motorola Moto X4 has a headphone jack, a longer-lasting battery, better low-light camera performance, and is compatible with all major US carriers.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. by Stephen Schenck. T-Mobile - T-Mobile + HTC - HTC + Android - Android +. 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. Smartphones run the gamut in terms of features and prices, and while we all might love to be carrying the hottest, best-performing, most stylish handset around, models like that have a tendency to also be among the most expensive. Luckily for shoppers who'd rather not spend the better portion of a month's rent on a new phone , there are also tons of more affordable options worth checking out. While some of those more budget-concious phones are built from the ground up as such, others emerge as scaled-down versions of full-price flagships, aiming to deliver a user experience that's still somewhere in the ballpark of what we'd get from their more expensive brethren, while dialing back on some of the less necessary expenditures. That kind of flagship-lite phone is just what we're looking at today, as HTC introduces the U11 life , a device that aims to deliver some of the same features and design elements as this year's earlier U11 , while doing so for half the price. What kind of trade-offs are we in store for? Does the U11 life succeed in its mission, or are you better off paying more for the U11 proper? Let's take a look. In the box: U11 life USonic earbuds w/ alternate tips SIM tool USB Type-C to Standard A cable Fast charger Safety guide Warranty booklet SIM tray guide Design What looks like a flagship doesn't necessarily feel like a flagship HTC's goals for the U11 life are pretty straightforward: take the U11, shrink it down a little bit, and make the phone more affordable in the process. So while the U11 life has the same basic look as its flagship namesake, instead of metal edges and a glass back, we've got a phone that instead incorporates a lot of plastic. The manufacturer has clearly tried its best to recapture the color-changing effect of the U11's back panel, but it's not quite the same here – there are aberrations where reflections separate into different colors, and the effect is just not as impressive as we saw with the U11. That said, you have to be paying a bit of attention to spot the differences, and at a casual glance HTC's efforts are pretty successful here. We are curious how well the new acrylic back will stand up to scratches over time, but so far we haven't run into many problems. Like the flagship, this model is also IP67-rated against dust and water ingress. Phone layout is very similar to the U11, with maybe the most pronounced difference being the absence of antenna lines around the handset's edge, thanks to the new plastic exterior. Buttons and the SIM tray are in the same places, as is the front-mounted fingerprint scanner. Around back, the camera may be larger this time around, and downgrades from a dual to single-LED flash, but placement is largely consistent. Down below, the speaker slot and USB port swap places. That's not great, and if there's one really annoying thing about the U11 life's design, it's that the bottom-edge USB Type-C port is mounted off-center, over to the phone's right. Type-C has been a great advancement for smartphones, freeing us from the hassle of making sure our micro-USB cables were facing the right way. But we're so accustomed to centered USB ports, that this move undoes a lot of that convenience, forcing you to once again pay more attention than you should need to when charging your phone. Display A solid display that doesn't hits all the right notes While the U11 went with a 5.5-inch Quad HD display, the U11 life offers a more conservative 5.2-inch 1080 x 1920 screen. The good news is that brightness is solid, despite the fact that peak brightness isn't as high as on the U11. Color accuracy is also decent but not perfect, resulting in a panel that feels right at home on a mid-range handset like this.. 5.87 x 2.87 x 0.32 inches. 149.09 x 72.9 x 8.1 mm. 5.96 x 3.01 x 0.34 inches. 151.5 x 76.4 x 8.6 mm. 5.8 x 2.79 x 0.29 inches. 147.3 x 70.9 x 7.45 mm. 6.15 x 3 x 0.24 inches. 156.2 x 76.2 x 5.99 mm.

Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright).

HTC U11 Life (with HTC Sense) review. by Joshua Vergara David Imel December 4, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus..

After being in flagship land for the last few weeks, I wanted to come back to a midrange offering that should be on everyoneâs radar. Despite being midrange, the price of HTCâs latest offering does not reflect the experience that it ended up providing. This is the HTC U11, HTC Sense edition.. Kris Carlon has already done a review on the Android One version of the phone and gave it very favorable thoughts, highlighting the screen and the camera experience. However, that version is the Android One edition that is available outside of the United States and rocks stock Â. This one is the version sporting HTCâs own software, HTC Sense.. Weâll start with that experience first, as one very important detail has to be mentioned right away – it has already been updated to Android Oreo along with the original U11 and the U11 Plus. This was a very welcome update for a phone that hasnât been out for very long, as the U11 Life is actually more up to date than some recently released flagships.. OnePlus 5T review: it’s all about that screen. With the OnePlus 3T, we got virtually the same body as the OnePlus 3, but packed with a new processor, more RAM, and a bigger battery. This year though, there isn't a â¦. The update affords the U11 Life access to the polish that weâve enjoyed in the latest edition of Android, including some features that further enhance the HTC Sense experience. Namely, the picture-in-picture mode is now part of the software suite, providing an easy way of using YouTube while performing other tasks.This feature is something weâve already enjoyed on the Pixel 2, with usage here remaining similar – in my case, YouTube and Maps are the main case scenarios. Even with the lower specifications of the U11 Life, PiP has been useful and reliable despite some noticeable stutter and lag that occurs when in use.. Speaking of similar experiences to the Pixel 2, Edge Sense puts the U11 family in line with the squeeze feature that activates Google Assistant on Googleâs official devices. The difference here is that Edge Sense can be customized for more than Assistant – it can open up any application, trigger some specific functions, and can do two tasks depending on a squeeze or a squeeze and hold. Just as it was on the Pixel 2, the feature becomes second nature when programmed to oneâs most used functions, and in this case I still set it to Google Assistant but set Google Keep for the squeeze and hold. There are also squeeze functions for when you are within applications, like a quick squeeze to zoom in when using Maps. This shows how an otherwise quirky feature is being leveraged for more use case scenarios, and puts Edge Sense that little bit above the Google Assistant-centric version found on the Pixels .. I mention Google Assistant as my squeeze choice because the U11 Life also comes with another assistant, Alexa. Amazonâs Alexa application does come on the U11 Life and provides many of the same functions that users might enjoy with their existing Echos. I tried to give Alexa a fair try, but I ultimately found many of the functions I wanted to perform were either not supported or already taken up by my existing Google systems. For users who are more deeply entrenched in the Amazon and Alexa suite, having it more portable in HTCâs smartphone is likely a big deal but for everyone else, it will probably sit.. Aside from all that, HTC Sense remains very familiar. It provides the Blinkfeed to the left of the homescreens, a feed that aggregates not only news but also social media activity into one easy to scroll area. Blinkfeed is a really good alternative to Google Now that requires a little extra setup – when signing into any social media network, signing into the version made for Blinkfeed is required.. The HTC U11 Plus is official: HTC’s true flagship for 2017 has arrived!. After years of struggling, the Taiwanese electronics company is taking a drastically different approach with its mobile devices. Gone are the days of metal-clad smartphones, itâs all about that glass now. Sense is also one of the cleaner versions of Android, and it provides some room for customization through a themes engine that has a large amount of contributors. Users can change the icon set, the colors, and even move into a fully customizable version of the homescreen interface that does not adhere to a grid. When you need a refresh of HTC Sense, the theme store is easy to access and is actually pretty powerful.. That is all powered by the Snapdragon 630, which should already tell you what kind of performance to expect from here. Though it might play a little bit of catch up to flagship device, it really isnât all that far behind. 3GB of RAM backs that up with a microSD card slot for expanding the 32GB of storage in my review unit. And as far as battery life goes, a pretty average 4.5 hours of SoT was achieved on most days using the 2600mAh unit.. Sense looks pretty great on this 5.2 inch Full HD LCD display that actually pumps out some good colors and is still plenty sharp for daily reading experiences. The visual appeal somewhat falters under the larger bezels that give way to mainly a fingerprint reader because there are no front facing speakers on this device.. The rest of the body is made of plastic but does have the colorful HTC backing that they have used on other U11 devices – the phone doesnât scream premium by any means, but HTC has found a way of mitigating that as there is a IP67 certification for water and dust resistance. So, even if it doesnât feel like the strongest phone out there, it can handle more than it lets on.. Heading down to the bottom of the device, the awkward placement of the USB-C port is almost a throwback to old HTC phones, but it reveals even more of an issue for the audio experience. The single bottom firing speaker gets pretty loud and doesnât sound all that great, but there is a pair of high quality USB-C headphones included in the box. These USonic compatible earphones work with the audio settings to cater the listening experience to the userâs ear profile, which is something we have seen in previous HTC flagships. Thankfully, the headphones turn out to be very enjoyable, with good bass and volume. These are certainly better than pretty much any other headphones that might be included in smartphone boxes.. What are the best USB Type-C headphones? Check out this list!. But the USB-C connector makes them proprietary, and the biggest bummer of the U11 Life audio experience is thus not just the lack of a headphone jack, but the lack of an included adapter. Users have to buy an adapter straight from HTC, which I feel is an unneeded extra cost on top of an already accessible price point. And if you have other USB-C adapters, they might not work with the proprietary data connection that HTC uses. If you get this phone because of its price, make sure you get the adapter as soon as possible, but if you are comfortable with using the included headphones almost exclusively, at least they sound quite great.. And finally, we can talk about the camera, which I wanted to spend a little more time with because HTC did not skimp out on them. 16MP shooters are found on either side of this device at f/2.0 aperture, which is impressive for an affordable phone. No, there is no dual camera, but that doesnât mean the camera quality suffers. In fact, the camera is an impressive performer. In good lighting conditions, the HTC U11 Life has proven itself as a reliable companion because of its good color reproduction and sharpness in all but low light situations. Things do fall apart pretty easily in even indoor situations where there is less light, but with a steady hand users can get some good photos – we mean steady because there is no OIS installed on here.. I compared pictures between the this and the original U11 and found there to be issues mainly in the low light shots – in good conditions, itâs impressed to see how HTC managed to provide comparable quality shots. All that really holds the Life back is the higher aperture and the lack of OIS, which change proportionately affect the comparison. The front facing camera yielded very similar results, though, as the specs are exactly the same.. The only real qualm we have with the camera experience is app, which is expectedly bogged down by the lower specifications. It does have some shutter lag and is slower than its flagship brethren – so, it will require a little bit of patience and fiddling to get the best possible photo, but at least the end product has been given quite a lot of attention.. 2017 was a really busy year for high-end and niche devices that pack so much in an expensive package, so it is refreshing to approach the end of the year on a high note struck by a phone that costs only $349. That could be $12 a month if you are using payment plans on the T-Mobile network or $300 outright, which is pretty incredible. There are other phones that are around this price point but I donât believe that they quite provide the complete package that HTC has managed with their U11 Life.. And so, there you have it – the HTC U11 Life. It should be obvious that this package is not going to please the power users or the spec hungry, but I can personally tell you that using this as my daily hasnât brought any major problems. My scores are just a bit below Kris Carlonâs review of the Android One edition, which is mainly due to my more critical view of the camera and the fact that HTC Sense, while spartan, is not as smooth or snappy as the ultra-minimalistic Android One software. But no matter which one you can pick (if you even have the choice), the main story here is the phoneâs value for the money. HTC has simply made a midrange version of their flagship device that shouldnât actually make anyone feel like theyâre missing out.. How do you feel about the HTC U11 Life?

You'll love HTC's U11 Life before you even realize it's a bargain.. An average display, but surprisingly good performance. Geekbench 4 CPU: 855 single-core, 4,078 multi-core. Say cheese! But stay very still. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. has it all: A gorgeous design, a great camera, smooth performance, and good battery life. But like most other Android flagship smartphones, it’s expensive at $650. To reach a wider audience, HTC’s bringing similar features and the U11’s design to the new U11 Life , all for just $350. In our review, we like what we see with the HTC U11 Life, and what you get for the low price tag makes it absolutely worth it.. The HTC U11 Life is a smaller, lighter U11 twin — put the two together and it’s hard to note many differences other than size. The U11 Life sports a 5.2-inch screen, as opposed to the the 5.5-inch U11. It makes the phone feel far more compact, though, making it easy to access the other side of the screen in one-handed use.. Weight is also an easy tell, as the U11 Life is 27g lighter than the U11. That’s largely due to the choice of build materials. The more expensive U11 is wrapped in glass, and it features the “liquid-glass” material that helps it give off a reflective shine. The Life feels more plasticky, but HTC mimics the shiny sapphire gleam with acrylic, a type of polymer.. The sapphire blue U11 Life is a little more muted in color; it’s not as shiny, and it doesn’t change colors in different lighting. It’s still unique, attractive, and you only have to worry about shattering the display’s glass if you drop it. The rear is fairly minimal, as you’ll only find a circular camera at the top, a flash next to it, and the HTC logo below.. On the right edge of the phone is a textured power button below the volume rocker. These buttons are a little too low for our liking, as we found we often have to shift the U11 Life up a little to tap the power button. One handy workaround, though, is to double tap the lock screen to wake or turn off the screen.. The HTC U11 Life’s sapphire gleam is still unique, and it looks attractive.. The low buttons also make it harder to use Edge Sense. This is a feature first introduced in the HTC U11, which lets you squeeze the bottom part of the phone to trigger an action, from opening Google Assistant to flicking on the flashlight — whatever you fancy. Google liked this feature enough to license it from HTC for use in its new Pixel 2. It’s now in the $350 U11 Life, and it works as advertised, though you have to make sure you don’t hit the power button. We should note, I have large hands, so this may not be a problem for other people.. Like most phones in its price range, the U11 Life doesn’t have skimpy edges around the screen, or what’s known as a “ bezel-less ” design. You’re out of luck if you want an HTC phone with this look in the U.S., because the just-announced U11 Plus, which has ultra-thin bezels, and a 6-inch 18:9 screen, isn’t coming to the U.S.. At least it’s not empty space — the fingerprint sensor, which doubles as a home button, sits on the bottom chin, and it’s flanked by two capacitive Android navigation buttons that light up when in use (or when the screen is on). The front-facing camera rests at the top, to the right of the earpiece.. HTC opts for a USB Type-C charging port like most flagship Android phones, but it’s situated oddly on the bottom right edge. The company told us the fingerprint sensor prevented placing it in the usual center spot, but we didn’t have any issues with the odd location. USB-C is both faster charging and more versatile than MicroUSB, which made it nice to see in this price range. Most budget Motorola phones, like the Moto G5S Plus, still use MicroUSB.. There’s no headphone jack, but that’s hardly a surprise considering HTC hasn’t used included one on most of its phones this year. Instead, you’ll get the company’s USB-C USonic headphones in the box. They’re decent — maybe a little too bass-heavy — but they adapt to the shape of your ear (after a quick setup process) and they offer Active Noise Cancellation. The noise cancellation is marginal, and there’s a strong hissing noise that’s distracting. Still, it’s nice USB-C earbuds are included in the box.. The only speaker, on the bottom edge at the center, can get fairly loud, but don’t expect much. It seems to artificially boost bass a little, but the highs sound pretty good.. Thankfully, HTC uses Bluetooth 5 , which is a newer version of the technology that offers faster data transfer and improved range. It’s a welcome feature, especially considering the flagship Huawei Mate 10 Pro removes the headphone jack but only uses the dated Bluetooth 4.1.. The U11 Life is IP67-rated, making it one of the most affordable water-resistant phones on the market. It’s tough to find a good phone with water-resistance, and the only comparable product in this price range is the Moto X4.. The 5.2-inch LCD screen offers a standard 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution, and it’s nothing to write home about. It doesn’t get as bright as we’d like and it’s not as colorful as an OLED panel, but it’s still barely visible in direct sunlight. Still, everything looks sharp and we didn’t have any major qualms with it.. Performance, on the other hand, surprised us. The HTC U11 Life is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 630 processor, with 3GB of RAM. Not many phones have this new chipset, but we saw it recently in Motorola’s Moto X4. We think the U11 Life performs better than the Moto X4, but the benchmark results are comparable.. These scores are marginally better, if not the same, as what the Moto X4 received. For example, the Moto X4 scored 70,217 on AnTuTu, and 840 on 3DMark. The U11 Life did beat out the X4 on single-core in Geekbench 4, but it’s down in multi-core. Benchmarks aren’t the be-all end-all of performance, but we’ve generally noticed everything on the U11 Life is a little smoother, with fewer snags, than the X4. It’s a good middle-ground between what you’ll find on slightly cheaper phones like the Moto G5S Plus and the Moto G5 Plus, and flagship-priced phones with the Snapdragon 835, like the Google Pixel 2 XL .. Performance, on the other hand, surprised us.. Scrolling through apps like Twitter was speedy, and the phone opens apps swiftly — though still a tad slower than a flagship phone with the Snapdragon 835, like the U11. We did run into a occasional stutter, but overall we’re satisfied with performance on this phone. Games like Transformers: Forged to Fight and Loner ran well without any glaring problems.. The HTC U11 Life comes with 32GB of storage, but there’s a MicroSD card slot that lets you increase it up to 2TB if you need more space.. model of the HTC U11 Life runs Android 7.1.1 , overlaid with HTC’s Sense user interface. This means you’ll find quite a few HTC apps — some bloatware — and Blinkfeed, which shows you news articles you may like and even ads (you can turn ads and even Blinkfeed off). It’s not great that the U11 Life isn’t shipping with the most recent version of Android, Android 8.0 Oreo , which has been out since August. But before you protest, HTC said the Oreo update will arrive by the end of November, perhaps even for the HTC U11. That’s impressive, as there still aren’t a lot of phones that have received 8.0 Oreo.. HTC’s user interface feels a little cluttered and clunky, but it’s all easily manageable and there’s a lot of theming you can do to personalize the phone’s look. Most of the software looks like pure Android, and it’s easy to follow and use.. There are three artificial assistants on board, which can make things confusing, but it also provides you with more options. There’s Google Assistant, which you can activate via Edge Sense, by pressing and holding the home button, or by saying “OK Google.”. Then there’s Amazon’s Alexa, but unlike the HTC U11, you can’t use a voice trigger to activate it. This is because the Snapdragon 835 in the U11 allows for two wake words, but the Snapdragon 630 does not. So you can either map Alexa to Edge Sense, or just open the app and start talking. There are no visual cues with Alexa, so you’ll strictly have to rely on its voice when using it. We prefer using Google Assistant particularly for this reason, but Alexa support is a welcome backup if you have Echo devices in your home.. The global model of the U11 Life will not run Sense UI, rather Android One instead.. The third assistant is one we’ve seen in prior HTC phones — Sense Companion. It’s not a voice assistant, but it will float on your home screen when it wants to offer up some relevant information based on the time of day and where you are, such as weather alerts, nearby food recommendations if you’re in a new city, and more. It gets better the more you use your phone, but we haven’t had much use for it in the week we’ve used the U11 Life.. Overall, the software is customizable to your liking, and while there’s some clunky UI elements and bloatware, it’s still better than other devices that tack on heavy Android “skins” or “themes” that bog down the system.. You should know the global model of the U11 Life will not run Sense UI, but Android One. It’s a pure Android version of the operating system, with just pre-installed Google apps, Edge Sense, and a promise to receive fast version and security updates as soon as Google releases them.. The U11 Life’s camera is markedly better than any other phone in its price range and below, but it’s still the weakest part of the phone.. It utilizes a 16-megapixel rear camera with a f/2.0 aperture, and the photographs it takes can be good, but most of the time they’re ruined due to the lack of optical image stabilization. You need to be very still to prevent any blurriness, as most of our photos ended up with a slight blur. Details aren’t that sharp, and there’s a lot of grain unless you’re taking a photo in broad daylight. Low-light isn’t great either, as images offer poor detail and they look a little blotchy.. What’s worse is the slight shutter lag, which is the amount of time from when you tap the shutter icon, to when the camera captures a photo. It’s virtually non-existent on higher-end phones like the iPhone X or Pixel 2, but there’s a noticeable delay on the U11 Life.. Still, color accuracy is pretty good, and were genuinely surprised at some photos taken with HDR. It’s unfortunate you have to put so much time and energy on staying absolutely still to try and get a good photo in focus.. Shutter lag and a lack of optical image stabilization hobble just about every budget phone. We’ve had the same issues with the comparably-priced Moto X4, for example, though the shutter lag was much worse.. Despite the unusual 16-megapixel front-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture, there’s not much interesting here. Slight movements, again, can produce blurry photos, and selfies can be quite grainy in anything other than direct sunlight.. The HTC U11 Life has a 2,600mAh battery capacity, and it may not last you a full day with heavy use. After taking it off the charger at 8 a.m., we used it to browse the web, play some music and games, download dozens of apps, watch a YouTube video or two, run benchmarking apps, and take photos. The end result was 17 percent charge by 5:30 p.m.. HTC U11 Life Compared To. That’s not bad, considering the workload we pushed on the U11 Life. You’ll be able to use the phone for just about full day, though with heavy use you may want to bring a portable battery pack or charging cable. If you’re a light user, this phone will easily get you through a day.. There’s nothing remarkable about the U11 Life’s charging speed. We saw it go from 15 percent to 50 percent within 35 minutes.. The HTC U11 Life is available unlocked from HTC’s website for $350. The only carrier that’s selling the phone is T-Mobile, and it will be available on November 3 at a even lower price. On a monthly payment plan, it will set you back $12 per month for 24 months after $12 down, or about $300. HTC said the U11 Life will work on AT&T’s network if you buy it on its website, though you won’t be able to use it on Verizon and Sprint.. HTC offers a standard limited warranty that protects your device of manufacturing defects for one year since the date of purchase.. HTC’s U11 Life will catch your eyes with its sapphire gleam, and your wallet will thank you. It offers great performance and water resistance, though the battery is average and the camera is hindered by shutter lag.. It’s a tough call in this price range. The Moto X4 is $50 more and shares many of the same specifications and features as the U11 Life, but we’re not fans of the camera at all.. The Moto G5S Plus has a mediocre camera, but only slightly diminished performance, and it’ll set you back $280. It has a metal build, but it’s not water-resistant and it doesn’t look good.. For better performance and camera, you’ll have to look to the $480 OnePlus 5. It has the Snapdragon 835 processor, and a good dual camera that lets you use fun features like Portrait Mode. You may want to wait, as there are rumblings of a OnePlus 5T. HTC has been improving its speed in providing software updates for its phones. Case in point: The HTC U11, which arrived this summer, is going to get Android 8.0 Oreo later this month. That’s far better than most manufacturers. Still, we expect this phone to last no more than two years. Since it’s low on the totem pole, we can’t even guarantee a version update after the second year.. It’s IP67 rated, so it can handle a dip in the pool. There’s no glass on the back, so you only need to make sure you protect that screen.. At this price range, the HTC U11 Life is the best phone you can buy. We think it’s better than its closest competitor, the Moto X4, and it certainly beats the Moto G line..

The HTC U11 Life is a mid-range phone made for buyers on a budget. Priced at $350 or below, it is visually similar to the U11, retaining the highly reflective and colorful design, as well as the water resistance and the fingerprint scanner, yet it is built of less sophisticated materials. Edge Sense is also on board, allowing you to trigger certain actions by physically squeezing the U11 Life. To sweeten the deal, HTC includes noise-cancelling earphones and a fast charger with its shiny mid-ranger.. HTC U11 life Review HTC U11 life manual HTC U11 life benchmarks.

HTC U11 Life (Android One) review The mid-range Pixel 2. by Kris Carlon November 17, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. The HTC U11 Life Android One is like a mid-range Pixel 2, made by the same company and with a very similar software experience, but coming in at half the price. While it has a lot going for it, there are a few things to consider that may negatively affect its widespread appeal.. Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 Mobile Platform. MicroSD Yes, up to 2 TB.

If you want a Google Pixel 2 but don’t want to drop so much money on a phone, the HTC U11 Life with Android One is the next best thing. It’s one of the â mid-range Pixels â made under the auspices of the Android One program, only it’s made by the actual manufacturer of the regular-sized Pixel 2.. but htc u11 LIFE ANDROID ONE ON aMAZON. Buy HTC U11 Life Android One on eBay. For all its highlights, the HTC U11 Life Android One still suffers from some of the same issues as the Pixel 2 and HTC U11 , chief among them being an arguably inflated price tag for what you get. There’s a lot to like about the U11 Life, but a few things to be wary of. Find out more in our HTC U11 Life Android One review.. About this review: I’ve been using the HTC U11 Life Android One for eight days, on the Blau network in Germany. The device is running Android 8.0 Oreo with build number 1.06.401.8 and was provided on loan from HTC’s German PR agency.. At half the price of the HTC U11 or Pixel 2 but with a lot of similar perks, the U11 Life Android One looks great on paper. It runs a stock+ version of Android Oreo , augmented by a full-fledged version of HTC Edge Sense and HTC USonic audio tuning. It comes with guaranteed OS updates for two years and security patches for three via Google’s Android One program.. At half the price of the HTC U11 or Pixel 2 but with a lot of similar perks, the U11 Life Android One looks great on paper. It has an IP67 water-resistant rating, a relative rarity at this price point, some of the best bundled earbuds I’ve ever tried, and a really competitive camera for this tier. It borrows the flagship design language of the HTC U11, has an excellent LCD display and fairly decent mid-range specs. But once you scratch the surface, there’s a little more to it that needs discussing.. It all starts with the design. While I applaud HTC for so faithfully emulating their flagship styling in a mid-tier offering, the U11 Life necessarily makes some concessions to its price point. Rather than Gorilla Glass wrapped around an aluminum frame like the U11, the U11 Life puts a Gorilla Glass front on top of a polycarbonate frame with an acrylic back panel.. I wouldn’t go so far as to say the U11 Life feels cheap, but it is clearly plastic. It sounds hollow, is very light and scratches much easier than a glass-backed phone. Considering how terribly this phone picks up fingerprints, I’d recommend using a case, even if its plastic construction makes it less likely to break than glass.. Changes in material choice are pretty standard in a mid-range phone. The same can usually be said of bigger bezels, but considering HTC only just managed to reduce its bezel size in the upcoming U11 Plus , the HTC U11 Life has basically the same bezel situation as the flagship U11. Unfortunately, the U11 Life doesn’t inherit the BoomSound Hi-Fi Edition speakers found on the larger U11 models.. The U11 Life uses its large bottom bezel to house capacitive navigation buttons and a solid-state fingerprint scanner. The navigation buttons work fine and can be constantly illuminated or switched off entirely. It’s a bit of a shame HTC didn’t offer on-screen navigation buttons as an option. The fingerprint scanner is reliable but not as fast as you’d find on a more expensive phone.. The history of Android OS: its name, origin and more. Sometimes it feels like we've been runningÂ. Google's mobile OS on our Android devices forever. However, it's actually been less than 10 years since the first official Android phone made its debut for consumers to buy â¦. The USB Type-C port is offset to the right of the mono bottom-firing speaker, something my lizard brain just couldn’t get used to no matter how many times I jabbed at the speaker with the USB Type-C charging cable or headphones.. There’s a microSD card slot in the nano-SIM tray on the top edge of the phone, which lets you expand the 32 or 64 GB of built-in storage. Those versions come with 3 and 4 GB of RAM respectively, with the 4 GB/64 GB version being an online exclusive available only via HTC.com. Considering the very minimal price difference between the two, the 4 GB/64 GB version is the natural choice (I reviewed the 3 GB/32 GB version). The mid-range Snapdragon 630 chipset lies at the heart of the U11 Life. While it might have been nicer to see a 660, the 630 is still used to good effect.. With its IP67 rating, the U11 Life can withstand submersion in a meter of fresh water for up to a half hour, which is a nice addition for a mid-range phone. Like other U11 models before it, the Life doesn’t have a 3.5mm headphone jack, though HTC tries to make up for it in other ways, which we’ll cover further later.. An IP67 rating is a nice addition for a mid-range phone, but the Life doesn't have a 3.5mm headphone jack. The U11 Life supports Bluetooth 5 so you can enjoy higher throughput or longer range on compatible accessories â for more on how Bluetooth 5 works check out Gary’s excellent primer. The U11 Life also supports always-listening hotword detection, NFC, VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling, and Cat. 11 download speeds of up to 600 Mbits/s and uploads of up to 75 Mbits/s.. The 5.2-inch Full HD LCD display on the HTC U11 Life was a very nice surprise. The 5.2-inch Full HD display on the HTC U11 Life was a very nice surprise. The Super LCD panel offers rich colors, good dynamic range, stable viewing angles, decent if not exceptional outdoor visibility (in excess of 500 nits), and was generally a lot better than I was expecting.. It wasn’t always very responsive to touch input, requiring some pretty forceful jabbing at times to register presses. This is a concession one has to make at lower price points, but it is more than made up for in the overall quality of the display.. HTC’s Edge Sense is a particularly nice addition to the U11 Life. Despite the Android One software experience, HTC managed to get a fully functional version of its squeezable frame technology on board, something even the Pixel 2 hasn’t got right now.. Some may see a pressure sensitive frame as a useless gimmick, but I found it very intuitive and used it a lot. The default options are pretty much the most useful, with a short squeeze taking you to the camera app whether the phone is unlocked or not. While in the camera, a long squeeze switches between front and rear lenses and a short squeeze takes a photo. Obviously this is a handy feature while in the water, wearing gloves or when you’re otherwise unable to use the camera as normal.. Outside the camera app, a long-squeeze typically launches Google Assistant (you can, of course, modify any or all of the default Edge Sense actions to your liking). Assistant can also be activated via voice or by long-pressing the home button. Unlike the US-bound Sense version of the U11 Life, HTC Sense Companion and Amazon Alexa are not included in the software out of the box.. HTC Edge Sense also lets you enable various in-app squeeze actions that you can customize at will. It takes a little memory to remember what everything does but once you’ve got the hang of it it’s really quite useful. You can also adjust the pressure sensitivity of the squeeze gesture or disable it entirely if it’s not your thing.. The HTC U11 Life runs Android Oreo out of the box, with a guaranteed update to Android P and Android Q thanks to Android One. The HTC U11 Life runs Android Oreo out of the box, with a guaranteed update to Android P and Android Q thanks to Android One. Android One devices are also assured security patches for three years, putting a very healthy shelf life on a mid-range phone. As sad as it sounds, this was a pretty unusual situation until Google re-pitched Android One for the mid-range market .. The near stock version of Android Oreo on the U11 Life runs just as smoothly and reliably as you’d expect. HTC has never had any real issues with software performance even with its Sense skin, so this should come as no surprise. Various Oreo-specific benefits are present here too, like background execution and cached data limits to better utilize the phone’s available resources and prolong battery life.. HTC also has its USonic audio tuning baked into the Settings menu. The U11 Life comes bundled with a pair of excellent USB Type-C USonic earbuds too. They can be used with the USonic software to tune the U11 Life’s audio to your particular hearing profile.. If you’re unfamiliar, HTC USonic essentially uses sonar to map your ear canal. There’s really nothing to it, simply insert the super-comfortable buds, tap a button to emit a short audio signal and it’s done. Your USonic active noise cancelling earbuds are now tuned specifically to your ears. Of course, the tuning can be disabled at any time.. I’m far from an audiophile, but even my ears can appreciate the richer bass and punchier highs USonic enables. Disabling the feature flattens everything out a little, and while this adds more to the mid-range I prefer the crispy highs and solid low end the USonic buds produce. They’re also admirably spatial for included headphones and have active noise cancellation to boot, another rare bonus at this price point.. How Oreo is better than Nougat: Audio. brings with it a host of new features, improvements, and overhauls to the core Android feature set.Â. Personally, I thought that the introduction of more Bluetooth audio options was one of the more interesting â¦. Audio on the HTC U 11 Life is also fine if you want to use Android Oreo’s high-end Bluetooth codecs like Sony LDAC or Qualcomm aptX and aptX-HD with compatible wireless headphones. The absence of a 3.5mm headphone jack will be make or break for many, and there isn’t even a USB Type-C to 3.5mm adapter in the box. HTC sells a digital adapter on its website though, which includes a built-in DAC.. Despite the excellence of the USonic earbuds, your alternative audio options are limited. Besides the bundled USonic buds, there’s not many USB Type-C headphones on the market that we’d actually recommend. You can buy the dongle from HTC for your wired cans (because a regular âdumbâ adapter won’t work with the U11 Life) or you can switch to Bluetooth headphones.. It’s also worth noting that the USonic buds won’t work with the majority of other phones either. Plug them into the USB Type-C port of the Galaxy Note 8 , LG V30 or Pixel 2 and audio will continue coming out of the external speakers rather than switching to the buds. This is because HTC uses a digital protocol not supported by many other companies. The USonic buds worked just fine with the Huawei Mate 10 Pro though.. The USonic earbuds are really your best option, with no BoomSound stereo speakers. Even without the wired headphone issue, there’s no stereo BoomSound Hi-Fi Edition speakers on the U11 Life, just the single mono speaker on the bottom edge. Although the U11 Life’s speaker is apparently âbuilt to be heard from the frontâ, don’t expect it to be anywhere near up to par with other U11 devices. I’ll grant that it’s relatively loud, it just doesn’t sound great. As far as audio on the U11 Life goes, the USonic buds are really your best option.. At this price range you have to expect less than flagship performance, but the U11 Life still performs admirably. Despite its mediocre specs sheet, which it shares to a large degree with the Moto X4, the U11 Life performs decently in benchmarking apps, the results of which you can peruse below. More importantly than numbers, in everyday usage the software runs as smooth and stable as most smartphones that cost twice as much. Oreo runs as smooth and stable as most smartphones that cost twice as much. The U11 Life is naturally not up to the serious processor-hungry tasks a power user might demand, and apps are slower to launch than a flagship owner would be used to. Over the course of a week I never encountered any circumstances where the U11 Life simply couldn’t handle a task or took too long to launch an app or menu. It’s simply a matter of adjusting your expectations and moving on.. If you’re at all concerned about performance (and even if you’re not), you might want to pop the extra cash to get the version with more storage and RAM, just to be on the safe side. The Snapdragon 630 is a slightly disappointing chipset choice, because considering the Google Pixel 2 also ships with 64 GB of storage and 4 GB of RAM, a U11 Life with a slightly beefier chipset could have been very competitive.. The upshot of the Snapdragon 630 is that the U11 Life does a lot with the minimal battery capacity it has. A 2,600 mAh cell won’t get anyone excited, but combined with Android Oreo and the small, low resolution display, the U11 Life regularly got me between 4.5-5.5 hours of screen-on time. I was never worried about it dying before the end of the day, but it did occasionally get close later at night.. With the included 5V/2A brick, the HTC U11 Life Android One takes a little over an hour and a half to fully charge a depleted battery. Half an hour or so of charging will get you just under 50 percent battery.. As with most choices in the mid-range, it’s a game of trade-offs. I might lament the absence of a beefier chipset that would’ve nudged the U11 Life a little closer to the Pixel 2 in terms of performance, but the Snapdragon 630 does a good job of keeping the lights on as long as it does. But battery life is far from a strong point of the U11 Life, and might even be its weakest point barring audio options beyond the bundled earbuds.. On the other hand, the camera is a surprising strength. The phone’s 16 MP f/2.0 cameras on the front and back produce very good photos for a phone in this price range. There’s no dual-camera bokeh trickery or zoom lenses, but the basics have been nailed.. Best Android smartphone cameras (October 2017). In recent years, smartphones have effectively replaced point-and-shoot cameras, and many even outperform them. For many of us, these portable computers have become our main camera,. making photo quality a priority when picking a new smartphone. As with practically any phone these days, the true measure of a camera comes in low light conditions. An f/2.0 aperture isn’t super wide, but it’s perfectly sufficient for most low-light scenes. You’ll need a decently steady hand though, as the U11 Life doesn’t feature OIS. Its phase detection auto-focus (rear camera only) is reliable though.. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the low light photos captured by the U11 Life. Having just gotten used to the Mate 10 Pro’s tendency to crush blacks while obliterating all noise, the U11 Life was a nice reprieve. Noise only just creeps into shots taken in very dark environments, the kind that would defeat almost all phones, no matter the cost. Generally speaking, the U11 Life minimized noise to a admirable degree while maintaining good colors and range.. I found that the U11 Life tended to slightly underexpose shots, but you can easily tap to focus and then adjust the exposure compensation slider to get it right for each scene. If you prefer to tap the screen to auto-expose, that’s available as an option in the camera settings. The U11 Life struggled a bit with blown out highlights in dark settings, but that’s true of practically any phone.. Colors are accurate and even, without over-saturation, though they’re unlikely to be punchy enough for some. The U11 Life captures a good amount of detail in good lighting, but things get a little muddy in the dark. Sooner or later noise is unavoidable. The U11 Life’s lowlight shooting was better than I expected and you can see just how well it performs against the Pixel 2 in the images below.. Daytime shots produce very balanced photos and like almost all smartphone cameras nowadays, you’d be hard pressed to mess up a photo on a sunny day. Having the same camera on the front and back of the phone is nice too, especially for the selfie inclined, but a 16 MP selfie shooter seems a little like overkill. I would’ve much preferred a more sedate front-facing camera and the addition of OIS on the main camera instead.. The phone's 16 MP f/2.0 cameras on the front and back produce very good photos for a phone in this price range. Both cameras have HDR Boost which handles dynamic range quite well, even if it does slow things down a little. The camera app isn’t the fastest thing about the U11 Life and had noticeable shutter lag. I’d love to convince myself it was intentional on HTC’s part to avoid camera shake when hitting the shutter button or using Edge Sense, but it’s ultimately down to the chipset used. Nevertheless, it is something you get used to.. The HTC U11 Life shoots 4K video at 30 fps with a six-minute time limit and supports Hi-Res Audio recording in video (which defaults to off every time you change the video quality settings). The HTC camera app has a variety of other modes including a pro mode with RAW, alongside hyperlapse, slow-motion (720p at 120fps), and the usuals like panorama and selfie beauty mode.. All things considered, I expected the software experience on the HTC U11 Life Android One to be as good as it is, but the camera performance was a very nice surprise. With a little patience and steady hands, you can get very good photos out of the U11 Life far beyond what you might have expected from a phone in this price range.. Should you spend â¬350 on the HTC U11 Life? I can’t give you a definitive âyesâ. There’s simply too many other competitive devices in that price range right now that now you’d need to check out first, some of which offer dual cameras and other things that might be make or break for you like the presence of a 3.5 mm headphone port.. What I can say though is that if you do buy it, I don’t think you’ll be disappointed. If the issues raised above aren’t the kinds of things that would immediately put you off a phone, the U11 Life Android One offers a whole lot of good stuff, from software and design to display and camera.. My biggest gripe with the U11 Life is the feeling that it’s slightly overpriced. That’s ultimately due to its chipset and battery size. If and when this phone goes on sale, I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend itâ assuming you can make peace with its slower performance and a smaller battery.. If you do spend â¬350 on the HTC U11 Life I don't think you'll be at all disappointed.. The HTC U11 Life Android One is now on sale in Europe for â¬349/â¬379. The Sense version went on sale in the US on November 3 unlocked for $349 and via T-Mobile for $300.. Buy HTC U11 Life Android One on eBay. As much as I know the U11 Life is far from the perfect mid-range phone for everyone, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time with it and will be sad to see it go. I opened this review with a reference to the Pixel 2, and I’ll end it with a reference to a device I also came to love, warts and all: the Nexus 5. In some ways the U11 Life feels like the Nexus 5: it has its flaws, but if you’re willing to accept them, you’re in for a real treat.. HTC Android One HTC U11 Life. Android One , HTC , HTC U11 Life.

HTC U11 Life (Android One) review: Keep it simple. HTC's first Android One device has everything you want from a mid-range phone — with highlights including Oreo out of the box, and a surprisingly capable camera.. Android One has arrived in Europe, and HTC is one of the first manufacturers to ship an affordable, Google-branded phone. The Android One badge made its debut in India and parts of Asia, as Google emphasized quality software on super-cheap hardware. But with its latest round of "One" handsets, the prices are higher, the products more premium, and the hand on the software rudder a little firmer.. The Android One U11 Life — unlike the T-Mobile U.S. version we reviewed separately, running HTC Sense — runs Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box, and comes with the promise of timely updates to future versions. It takes the fundamentals of HTC's flagship phone and downscales it into a smaller size, while trimming the specs back to the essentials.. There's a Snapdragon 630 processor — Qualcomm's latest mid-ranger, and the successor to the very capable 625/626 — along with 3GB or 4GB of RAM, and 32 or 64GB of storage, plus microSD. I've been using the 3/32GB model for the past couple of weeks, however the UK will be getting the more capacious 4/64GB model when it goes on sale.. From the outside, the U11 Life is a reasonable approximation of the full-grown U11 — at least visually. The reflective, curved back panel is as eye-catching as ever, but in the hand, the "acrylic glass" feels somewhat cheaper than the real thing. Same deal with the plastic borders around the sides of the device.. Many phones around this price point incorporate metal or glass designs, but I'm still fine with the U11's not-quite-glass exterior. The feel isn't a million miles away from the standard U11, with the main difference being the weight.. The U11 Life also boasts water and dust resistance, like the U11, with an IP67 rating.. Around the front, a 5.2-inch 1080p LCD panel gives the U11 Life a display that's bright and punchy, but not too oversaturated. Viewing angles are impressive, and I encountered no issues using the display out in bright daylight.. A 5.2-inch screen is a step down from the much larger displays we're seeing at the high end, but these dimensions, particularly with a 16:9 aspect ratio and off-screen keys, remains something of a sweet spot for easy one-handed use.. The back of the U11 Life is acrylic glass, which is more of the former than the latter.. Like its namesake, the U11 Life sports ample quantities of bezel in all directions around its display, most noticeably around the chin, which accommodates the phone's speedy fingerprint scanner. It's not quite as instantaneous as what you'll find in a high-end phone, but the (very slight) delay in unlocking isn't really bothersome.. As an Android One device, the software of the U11 Life is mainly a Google-centric experience. It's pretty much stock Android 8.0 Oreo , with a couple of HTC touches where it makes sense. The most obvious of these is the camera app, which is literally just the U11's camera app with a different icon, along with includes HTC's excellent HDR Boost — an always-on post-processing feature similar to the Pixel's HDR+.. In daylight, or moderate indoor light, HDR Boost allows the U11 Life to produce some striking images with rich colors and impressive dynamic range, but in darker conditions, the phone soon runs into the physical limits of its hardware. The f/2.0 lens and 16-megapixel camera, without OIS, means that night photography quickly becomes grainy and/or blurry, unless you're able to stabilize the camera and shoot a longer exposure in Pro mode.. Ironically, the front-facing camera, also a 16-megapixel unit behind an f/2.0 lens, seemed to hold up a little better in darker conditions — possibly just because of the kinds of photos I was taking.. For video, 4K capture is supported — though, strangely, only through the rear camera — with image quality following a similar pattern to the still camera. In daylight to middling light, it's decent; in low light it quickly becomes a grainfest. (And given the size of 4K video files, you'll want to invest in a decent SD card if you plan on shooting lots of 4K video with the 32GB model.). Android One is more Nexus than Pixel.. Other areas of the U11's software are clean, fast, and as Google-y as you'd expect. It's as minimalist as Google's Pixel UI — perhaps more so, as it lacks many of the Pixel's extra features. After initial setup, your app drawer shows 25 Google apps, and nothing else. It's a wonderfully uncluttered experience, particularly in comparison to the cruft that seems to find its way onto most mid-tier Android phones.. And when it comes to performance, the U11 Life provides a consistently responsive experience, even with just 3GB of RAM in our review unit, so the UK retail version with a roomier 4GB should be even better.. Edge Sense is the other major HTC addition. Just like the U11 and U11+, you can squeeze the bezels to activate an app of your choice (for example, Google Assistant or the camera). And there are a handful of in-app squeeze options too, such as squeezing to snooze an alarm or answering a call.. It's another one of these "moderately useful" features. But also nice to have, though also not something I miss when I change to another phone.. Battery life from the built-in 2,600mAh has been dependable, but not exceptional. The relatively low capacity is offset by the fact that the Snapdragon 630 sips power, meaning I never struggled to reach the end of the day with moderate use. On heavier days, with extensive use of the camera and HDR Boost, it's possible you'll need an evening refill, and the U11 Life supports 5V/2A charging for relatively speedy recharges.. The HTC U11 Life isn't the most exciting Android phone out there right now, but it does represent a great case for Android One in the West, and how HTC can create great mid-tier devices that make sense around the £350 price point. There are clear advantages to spending more than this on a phone — mainly camera improvements, more premium materials and more dazzling displays. But the Android One-flavored U11 Life provides a fast, clean Android experience, layers on top some impressive camera tricks, and the occasionally convenient Edge Sense, and then just gets out of the way.. We'll have to wait and see how speedily Google and HTC manage to get this device updated with Android 8.1 and beyond — not to mention the more important question of security patches. But right now the U11 Life is definitely worth a look if you're upgrading from something like a Nexus 5X, HTC One M9 — or if you're just after a solid all-around phone without breaking the bank..

HTC U11 Life review: High style at a low price, with compromises. HTC's bringing a budget phone back to the U.S., and it's hoping the U11 name will help it out this time around.. The U11 Life is better-looking than most phones at $350, and has nice features like waterproofing, a good screen, and active noice-cancelling headphones in the box. The build quality drops off significantly from the "original" U11, as you'd expect being less than half the price. The daily performance leaves something to be desired, as other phones with the same specs have better speed and fluidity. This will be a great device for many, but it definitely isn't the U11 experience scaled down proportionately — it's far more of a give-and-take choice.. Beautiful design for this price level. Built well, even if out of cheaper materials. USonic USB-C earbuds with noise cancellation. Camera slow and weak in low light. No headphone jack or USB-C adapter. HTC U11 Life Things you'll love. For HTC, the U11 was a relative hit. It's not challenging Samsung for sales figures, but I think it's doing better than expected. To hopefully parlay some of that good brand awareness in 2017, it's launching a $350 phone with the same name and type of design to hit an altogether new market. The U11 Life does a pretty great job of bringing the looks and quality of the U11 down to less than half the price.. A slice of that U11 style for about half the price.. Setting the U11 Life next to a "proper" U11, it's tough to tell them apart. The flowing, colorful back, sleek lines and shiny sides meet up with an inky black front with relatively large bezels. It looks far more expensive than it is — and far better than your average "did anyone even think about this design?" look in this price bracket.. But then you pick it up, and realize HTC has done a full recreation of the U11 in plastic. Not cheap plastic, or creaky plastic — well-executed molded plastic. The back is "acrylic," technically, as HTC will tell you, and that helps it mimic the glass back of the U11 while being substantially cheaper and easier to work with. The phone feels like plastic, it isn't fooling anyone, but for $350 it's tough to expect much else. Despite that it feels nice and sturdy, but we can certainly expect that soft plastic to scuff and ding over the course of a couple years in ways that metal and glass wouldn't.. Instead of higher-end materials, HTC spent the money on components and features. For this budget device, a Snadragon 630 processor, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage (with microSD) and a 1080p display definitely aren't a given. And the 5.2-inch SuperLCD panel is solid at that, even if it isn't as bright as the ones found on phones a couple hundred dollars more.. Then you get some extra hardware features also not often found on a cheap device. There's a good fingerprint sensor on the front, HTC's "Edge Sense" squeeze function, IP67 water-resistance, a pair of capable 16MP cameras, NFC, Bluetooth 5.0 and a pair of HTC's USonic active noise-cancelling earbuds in the box. All of these features, aside from the camera components, are shared with the full-priced U11 in an attempt to great some consistency in the lineup. This will make the sales pitch in T-Mobile stores a whole lot easier.. You can actually take some fine photos, with the typical low-light shortcomings.. The U11 Life's cameras are actually quite good, right on par with what you'd expect at this lower price. You get a 16MP BSI sensor with f/2.0 lens on both the front and back, with the rear camera getting a few extra features like auto focus, HDR, manual mode and 4K video. The rear camera produces surprisingly good photos in daylight, with a good amount of detail and colors that pop. Its HDR mode can get some light and color out of areas where most cheap phones struggle.. But the rear camera has all of its own struggles. Primarily in low light, where it really fights to get a clear shot. Not only is there a good bit of noise, that's still paired up with slower shutter speeds to give you some blur unless you're dead-steady with your hands. Typically you'll get something with the ISO cranked up in order to get a usable photo, but low light shots are obviously the clear shortcoming of the lower-end camera components.. HTC U11 Life Things you'll hate. The U11 Life, when it arrives in Europe, will be one of the new crop of slightly higher-end Android One phones. But here in the U.S., it's just a standard HTC phone with the same Sense software — whether you're buying from T-Mobile or unlocked. I make the distinction because these lower-end devices often benefit heavily from the light and performant Android One software experience, and this is the U11 Life's one major shortcoming.. We all expect a $350 phone to have slower performance than the $700+ flagships they look up to — but the U11 Life comes up even short of those lowered expectations. I say that because despite its Snapdragon 630 processor and 3GB of RAM, the phone just doesn't come close to the performance of the Moto X4 (which I just reviewed) with the same exact specs pushing the same screen size and resolution. Apps are notably slower to load, you get an additional hesitation now and a gain, and sometimes scrolling lags. The camera in particular is slow to open and function.. As I found in my review of the HTC U11 , Sense itself is a fine take on Android — and I still feel that way about the interface design on the U11 Life. The only real issue here is the inconsistent and slow performance that just doesn't line up with the specs.. I wonder if performance has been ratcheted down for battery life reasons, because the U11 Life has done surprisingly well in this respect even though it has just a 2600mAh battery. I was able to push through a full day as I normally do on any other phone and come out with at least 15% at bedtime, which I definitely wouldn't have expected after the Moto X4 did roughly the same with a 15% larger battery. And one other interesting thing to note on the subject: HTC doesn't include Quick Charge on the U11 Life, just standard 5V/2A charging.. It's disappointing to see weaker performance than phones with the exact same specs.. The one big caveat to all of this is the current state of the software. The U11 Life is shipping with Android 7.1.1, but HTC is committing to sending out the Android 8.0 update within 30 days of the launch. Considering the tight release time frame, it makes us wonder if there will be much more optimization for speed and fluidity in that upcoming release. We'd never say to buy a phone based on what performance could be with a future update, but we sure hope Oreo improves the U11 Life's performance up to the levels where we know these specs can offer.. And then there's the other wrinkle that the global version of the U11 Life is actually shipping with Android One software. This version will have a cleaner (and presumably consistently faster) take on Android 8.0 not far removed from the Google Pixel 2 , with few customizations from HTC. But that model isn't coming to North America, and this model also isn't going global — so you can't cross-shop between the two, you get what you get.. The rest of the handful of issues with the U11 Life are audio-related. It has a single speaker, and it's pretty weak at that — a far cry from the U11's rich and loud dual speakers. It also skips out on the headphone jack, which I think is even more of a bad decision on an inexpensive phone where people are even less likely to pony up for expensive Bluetooth headphones. HTC doesn't include a USB-C to 3.5 mm headphone adapter, either — but for what it's worth my Essential Phone and Google Pixel 2 adapters worked, and HTC sells 'em for $11.99. But the one bit of respite is HTC including its USonic active noise-cancelling headphones in the box, which are a step up from the headphones with most phones at this price (if you get them at all).. HTC U11 Life Should you buy it?. HTC executed pretty well on its goal of brining the U11 design down to a much lower price point, and also kept many of the hardware features that you don't typically see down here. It's an attractive phone with a nice spec sheet, good screen and an average pair of cameras to round it out.. You get a feel of flagship features, but have to take a couple compromises at this price point.. But it's really easy to question the lackluster and inconsistent performance on a phone that certainly has the spec sheet to do much better, and you wonder if it will continue to be this bad after the Android 8.0 update arrives. If there's one thing we've seen in the past couple of years, it's that cheap phones don't have to be slow or stuttery — they can be fast and smooth.. Buying from T-Mobile at what I assume will be a discounted sub-$349 price, the U11 Life stands strong against the rest of the cheap competition that's filled with compromises and so often misses on many of the core specs and features the U11 Life still has. It's an easy buy for someone who doesn't want to spend a lot but still wants a little slice of the flagship experience and is willing to give up on overall performance to get it.. But even at this lower price, and especially at the unlocked price of $349, you wonder why someone would pick up the U11 Life rather than something like a Moto G5 Plus and get better performance. Or hey, even step up just an extra $50 to get the fantastic Moto X4 that is on a higher level in terms of hardware materials, performance and cameras..

The HTC U11 Life is a smart trimming down of the HTC U11 that gets you most of the highlights at a lower price, but other phones offer more for a similar amount of money.. HTC U11 Life price and availability Key features Pressure-sensitive sides help it stand out Smart compromises other than the battery Design Smooth plastic/acrylic back Fingerprint scanner Squeezable pressure-sensitive sides Screen 5.2-inch Full HD LCD screen Good image quality. HTC isn’t a company afraid to try new things. In the last few years several of these haven’t panned out too well, like the HTC U Ultra ’s second touchscreen, but the HTC U11 Life is a phone with a concept we can appreciate immediately.. It’s a mid-range phone with an accessible price that uses Google’s new Android One program. This means you get an almost untouched version of Android, with the aim of getting much faster updates than other mobiles. That is, unless you're in the US, in which case you get HTC's Sense skin on top.. There are notable shortfalls to match the cut-down price tag, like poor low light photo quality, relatively weak speakers and a body made of plastic. But it’s a solid choice for those on a mid-size budget.. The HTC U11 Life costs $349/£349 (around AU$460), half the price of top-end alternatives and a lot less than the full-fat HTC U11 .. It sees it rub shoulders with the likes of the Honor 9 , Moto X4 , Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact and Samsung Galaxy A5. These are some seriously strong mid-range contenders which ensure the U11 Life won't have an easy ride.. There are two main ways to view the HTC U11 Life. It’s a much cheaper alternative to the original HTC U11 that gets you a roughly similar experience, with some parts cut down to lower costs.. It’s also an Android One phone in most regions, meaning it uses the standard Android interface, making it a little like a Google Pixel phone not made by Google.. Core elements it inherits from its bigger, more expensive brother include a shiny, curved rear and pressure-sensitive sides that enable gestures not seen in other phones.. This is HTC’s attempt to stand out. It may not change how you use a phone, but HTC has made it customizable enough to let you dig deep and make the feature your own.. Cost compromises are, for the most part, not too glaring. The screen is 1080p rather than ultra-high resolution, and the HTC U11 Life’s chipset is a mid-range Snapdragon 630 rather than a top-tier chipset. Major improvement in the graphics chip means it performs well in real life, though.. As is common among mid-range phones, the camera can’t quite compete with the best in all situations. Great photo processing makes day-lit photos often look fantastic, but it falters at night and fine detail isn’t as sharp or clear as that of a higher-quality, lower-resolution sensor.. The build isn’t quite on-par with the HTC U11 either. That phone has a glass back, the U11 Life an acrylic/plastic one. The biggest difference in feel is that while glass is cold to the touch when there’s the slightest chill in the air, plastic isn’t.. You’ll have to decide whether that matters to you or not.. After using the phone for a while the only compromise that we think might annoy some is battery life. While not flat-out poor, the Moto X4 and Honor 9 last longer between charges. The HTC U11 Life’s 2,600mAh battery is just not all that big.. From arm’s length the HTC U11 Life looks a lot like the normal U11, which is a more expensive phone. The back is curved and shiny, reacting to light as if the stuff gets it excited.. However, the HTC U11 Life’s back is made of “acrylic glass” rather than actual glass. There’s none of the cool hardness that comes with metal or glass, and as a result the HTC U11 Life does not feel particularly expensive. The Moto G5S Plus , Moto X4 and Honor 9 all feel more impressive.. The HTC U11 Life’s build is pleasant enough, though. HTC has made sure there are no hard, flat surfaces. Everything is smooth and curvy, while the ultra-accessible 5.2-inch screen welcomes hands of all sizes.. This is not, however, one of the new breed of phones with an ultra-narrow screen surround. There are a couple of blank millimeters to each side, and about an inch above and below the screen.. It seems petty to make too much of an issue of this right now, though, when the trend is only developing, not quite the norm yet. Let your eyes decide whether you’re bothered or not.. Other parts of the HTC U11 Life hardware are sound too. The phone has IP67 water resistance, meaning it can take being submerged, and there’s a good fingerprint scanner on the front.. Some versions of the HTC U11 Life have an excellent 64GB storage too. Ours has “just” 32GB, but buy from HTC and you get 64GB. Ours is the European model, where the US and UK get the 4GB RAM/64GB edition.. The hardware feature that sets the HTC U11 Life apart, though, is Edge Sense. This uses pressure sensors on the sides of the phone to enable gestures when those sides are squeezed. As standard, a quick squeeze launches the camera and a long one fires-up the Google digital assistant.. However, Edge Sense can be customized too. It can zoom in Google Maps or Google Photos, snooze alarms, or answer calls. These are sensibly disabled as standard because HTC doesn’t want you to accidentally fire off these features and start thinking your phone is haunted.. You can even create your own macros by going into an app and “recording” commands. We doubt whether many HTC U11 Life buyers will put the effort in, but HTC is clearly trying hard to squeeze the most out of Edge Sense.. HTC introduced Edge Sense with the U11: it’s not an old feature.. One omission may kill the appeal of the HTC U11 Life for some of you, though. It doesn’t have a headphone jack, just a USB-C port. A reasonable pair of USB-C earphones is included, but there’s no 3.5mm adaptor.. The HTC U11 Life has a smaller, lower-resolution screen than the U11. However, it’s a punchy display that, in most conditions, doesn’t look much worse than any phone out there.. It’s a 5.2-inch 1080 x 1920 Super LCD. There’s not too much brightness loss at an angle, and color is well-saturated without looking overdone. The image also appears very close to the top surface, a sign of an advanced super-thin screen architecture.. You have to take the HTC U11 Life into a more extreme environment to see its limits. We’re not talking Bear Grylls fodder, just that you’ll see very slightly raised blacks in a darkened room, and the brightness is bright but not quite the 1000 nits of the brightest. That said, we took the phone out on a fairly bright day and the screen was still clearly visible.. HTC’s website claims there’s a feature that lets you customize the display color profile, but it’s not in the software of our model.. Next Page Battery life and camera.

The U11 Life is a delightful-looking mid-range phone that could more accurately be described as the ‘U11 Lite’. In many ways this handset offers a very solid deal, packing some great features into an attractive shell. For me, however, some fairly awful software problems mean I can’t seriously recommend it.. The U11 Life is unashamedly plastic. I love the shiny blue coating around the rear, although it picks up grease smudges if you so much as even look at it. I’m not overly concerned by this, though, as even with a little hand grease on board it still looks fabulous – unless it’s under direct light, that is.. It’s a 5.2-inch handset , but it doesn’t feel quite that large. A thin bezel sits around the screen, which, combined with the tapering rear, makes the U11 Life exceptionally easy to hold. All the buttons that matter are on the right, with a volume rocker and a dimpled standby/power button that’s easy to find.. On the front you’ll find a small fingerprint scanner, an LED notification light up at the top, and the front-facing camera.. Along the bottom edge is a USB-C connector that’s placed weirdly off-centre, but no headphone jack. HTC includes a reasonably decent pair of USB-C headphones in the box, but no dongle with which to attach your regular 3.5mm headphones. And there’s no dongle that allows you to charge while listening to your tunes or podcasts, either, which is just infuriating. Budget another £20 for buying these essential accessories.. The U11 Life is IP67-certified, meaning it should survive a drop in the toilet or a heavy rain shower. This is a welcome feature – and by no means standard at this price point.. The 5.2-inch panel has a Full HD resolution for a pixel density of 424ppi. This is about as much as most people could ever want, and in general it’s a very good display indeed. It’s just a standard LCD panel, without any of the bells and whistles of an AMOLED – but it really doesn’t need it.. Colours are bright and punchy, and there are no issues with colour shifting if you’re viewing the phone from an awkward angle. The likes of the Google Pixel and iPhone X could learn a thing or two here. Sadly, it does have one shortfall: there’s a fair bit of motion blur when scrolling vertically. It isn’t the worst I’ve seen, but it’s certainly quite jarring.. It’s also worth mentioning the LED notification light here, since it has an impact on the experience. If you happen to be low on battery, the light will flash intensely until you plug in the device or it dies completely. The light will flash even when the screen is on, which proved particularly distracting.. As for sound quality, the built-in speaker is impressive. I wouldn’t describe it as loud, but it offers good range and doesn’t distort. As for the USB-C jack, the obvious advantage of a digital-only output is that it removes the distortion and poor quality of an analogue port. HTC phones are generally regarded as some of the best in the business when it comes to on-board audio, and the U11 Life continues to impress here..

Imagine Android One devices being on the fastest possible track to every official Android update, so as soon as a new version of the OS is released, Android One devices will be first in line.. That’s great, and solves one of Android’s biggest problems. Sadly, HTC seems to have introduced a few of its own, and my two weeks using this phone have been somewhat frustrating. I’m not sure what HTC has done to the operating system, but it feels slower and jankier than I can remember any phone being.. Switching between apps takes an age, and if you switch back to an app you had open only seconds earlier, it will more often than not completely re-open the app as a fresh start, forgetting what you were doing.. Overall performance was generally disappointing, too. That’s surprising given the U11 Life is rocking one of Qualcomm’s 630 processors and 3GB of memory. This is more than enough for most phones, and I’m at a loss as to why it feels so awful on the U11 Life.. Trusted Reviews was told that the review unit was running final software, but it really doesn’t feel like it.. The squeezable EdgeSense first seen in the high-end U11 is present here, letting you set actions according to different levels of squeeze. I found it super-handy for turning my mobile hotspot on and off when I was at a poorly organised press event with no Wi-Fi. EdgeSense might look gimmicky, but when you find a use for it, it becomes a natural part of using the phone.. The camera is good for most purposes. As you’d expect, it’s at its best in well-lit conditions. Indoors, and at night, you’ll need steady hands: there’s no optical image stabilisation and the 16-megapixel unit has only a relatively narrow aperture of f/2.0. Still, the HDR on board can produce some very pleasing shots.. Food looks good, landscapes look decent, and sunsets are captured relatively well.. The front-facing sensor is pretty decent, too, capturing natural and surprisingly detailed selfies.. Here are a few sample shots from the rear camera:. The 2600mAH battery is capacious enough to last a full day of use; I didn’t find myself running out of juice within a 16-hour day. I was running below 20% by about 10pm most nights, but given the degree to which I use my phone, I’m not too surprised.. If it weren’t for dodgy-feeling software, the U11 would be a decent buy at £349. As it stands, it’s hard to recommend. There are better phones available for around the same price, including the Moto Z2 Play with its amazing battery life and excellent software, and the slick Honor 9 – although this costs £50 more.. The U11 Life is by no means a bad phone, and it’s a shame that a few software oddities completely ruin the experience. In every other way, it’s a decent piece of kit.. The U11 Life is a decent mid-range handset let down by software issues. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network. 
Trending iPhone X Nintendo Switch OnePlus 5T Tesla Model 3 Xbox One X. HTC U11 Life review: You can do better. by Justin Herrick | December 3, 2017. This year we haven’t seen a flood of phones come from the Taiwanese company. It’s decided to focus on a very small number of products. That’ll continue into 2018 as HTC sold a significant piece of its mobile division to Google for more than $1 billion. But, until next year, all we know is that HTC believes it can get by with just three phones leading its lineup. The U11 debuted in May, and then the 2017 flagship was joined by the U11+ and U11 Life.. HTC’s U11+ is nearly identical to the U11. The main difference is the aspect ratio of the display. With the U11+, you’re getting a larger 6-inch display with 18:9 aspect ratio. To achieve that, HTC greatly reduced the top and bottom bezels. The U11 Life, meanwhile, doesn’t enjoy the same benefits. It’s a mid-range phone, but HTC didn’t seem to care enough about it to do anything but make a miniature U11 with watered-down specifications.. The front and back of this phone tell very different stories. When you’re looking at it from behind, the U11 Life is really attractive. It’s made of blue-colored plastic, not glass, but the appearance makes you think otherwise. And it doesn’t feel cheap in your hands. HTC successfully imitated glass; however, the plastic doesn’t necessarily give a strong and weighted feel. It’s more the look of glass you’re getting from the U11 Life’s back.. You have to wonder why HTC didn’t use glass (or aluminum) considering a number of other products in the segment are boasting premium materials. Even HTC used aluminum in 2015 for the One A9, so reverting back to plastic these days is a bit puzzling.. Unfortunately the U11 Life’s front doesn’t get any better. The top and bottom bezels, often referred to as the “forehead” and “chin,” are massive. HTC didn’t shrink them in any way. The bottom bezel hosts the home button (also a fingerprint scanner) and two capacitive buttons. Up top, somehow a large bezel is necessary to house the earpiece and front-facing camera. This was the perfect opportunity to slim down the bezels by embracing on-screen navigation keys, and instead we got a dated design.. Also, not that it matters to everyone, the power button and volume rocker are very weak. Half the time you attempt to press them you’re not sure if you actually did because there’s no click. It feels like you’re pushing on a pillow.. If there’s any consolation prize to the poor design, it’s the inclusion of Edge Sense and IP67 certification. HTC’s touch-sensitive technology lets you squeeze U11 Life to complete actions. And, for those of you who take your phone everything, there’s no need to worry about water or dust. The U11 Life is built to handle tough conditions, and the plastic body probably won’t shatter into a million pieces upon hitting the ground. But honestly, HTC dropped the ball to reinvigorate design for mid-range hardware.. The U11 Life doesn’t blow you away with its display, speed, battery life, or camera. Those are the essentials every phone aims to be decent at, and HTC’s U11 Life falls short in most areas. At least the display is pretty good. HTC included a Super LCD display that, at Full HD (1920×1080) resolution, shows crispness and vibrant colors. Usually a display based on LCD technology comes across as cold and lifeless, but the panel on the U11 Life bucks that trend.. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 630 is the showrunner here. It’s paired with 3GB or 4GB of RAM, so the U11 Life won’t slow down from multitasking. What holds performance back is, though, is the processor itself. The Snapdragon 600 series isn’t made for speed. Qualcomm positions these processors to be efficient. And that the U11 Life is. Apps don’t load instantaneously, but you can easily jump between Android Messages, Twitter, and Google Maps without things crashing or restarting. It’s certainly on par with other phones using the same processor or a similar one.. HTC does pick up a minor victory in audio. The USB-C port, which is the only port available, feeds premium sound into your ears. USonic technology brings active noise cancellation and high-res audio stereo audio, the latter being a longtime advantage for HTC. There’s also decent sound firing out of the sole bottom-facing speaker, and you could argue it makes for a better listening experience than some flagships’ speakers do.. And don’t worry, HTC includes the USonic-ready earbuds with every U11 Life. So you’re not forced to buy your own or go all-in on Bluetooth.. Battery life is on the underwhelming side. HTC doesn’t give a clear estimate, but we’re able to share what we found. The U11 Life can make it through a regular day. Just don’t push the phone to its limits. If you’re constantly switching apps and using power-hungry services like Snapchat for hours, you’re not going to be too happy. But, for those who check their phone here and there to respond to messages or check emails, you’re going to get by.. The good news is that HTC included Quick Charge 3.0 to refuel the phone fast.. There was a time when the best non-stock Android experience came from the Taiwanese company. Well, as the years have gone by, HTC lost that advantage. Samsung, too, presents an attractive software overlay on top of Google’s mobile operating system. And, seriously, HTC’s Sense is starting to look and feel old.. The U11 Life is running Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box, which is now slightly behind. But there is a software update immediately available that brings the phone up to Android 8.0 Oreo. HTC continues to be one of the best at delivering timely software updates.. Props to HTC for going light on pre-installed apps. The U11 Life doesn’t have anything overlapping with Google’s standard batch of apps on any Android device. The only bloatware found on the U11 Life are Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and Under Armour Record. Everything else belongs to HTC or Google.. before, the U11 Life does ship with Edge Sense. So you can squeeze your phone to launch the camera (or any other designated app). There are also in-app options like taking pictures, zooming in on Google Maps, and anything else you want to set.. Does the U11 Life have good cameras? That’s tricky. Overall, it’s probably better than most competing products. The 16MP rear camera handles itself well in good lighting, but it loses sharpness as soon as natural light’s gone. The HDR Boost really helps the U11 Life take passable shots.. HTC’s U11 Life sits in an awkward position. At $300 or $349 (depending where you buy from), it’s less expensive than the OnePlus 5T but more expensive than the Moto G5 Plus. Both of those competitors, though, might be a better choice for you. Motorola created a well-made phone that’s very affordable. OnePlus, meanwhile, brought modern qualities to its blazing-fast flagship. So it leaves HTC in the corner with the U11 Life, which looks really old and doesn’t particularly excel at anything.. It’s not a bad phone, per se. You just find something much better while saving money or spending a little bit more. So, to be clear, the U11 Life isn’t worth your attention. If you’re loyal to HTC, go for the high-end U11..

The HTC U11 is fantastic so releasing a less expensive version that checks all of the key boxes makes sense. The HTC U11 Life is one of the best in a growing sub-$400 mid-range smartphone market that challenges today's flagships priced at least twice as much.. for Smartphones and Cell Phones. | November 2, 2017 -- 07:01 GMT (15:01 GMT+08:00). Specifications Processor : Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 octa-core Display : 5.2 inch 1080x1920 pixels resolution Super LCD with Gorilla Glass Operating system : Android 7.1.1 Nougat with HTC Sense and August 2017 security patch RAM : 3GB Storage : 32GB internal with microSD expansion card slot Water and dust resistance : IP67 Cameras : Rear 16 megapixel, f/2.0 aperture camera.

Software Price and competition Daily usage experiences and conclusion. The HTC U11, see our full review , is one of the most underrated phones of 2017 and is often ignored because it has distinctive bezels, capacitive buttons, and no headphone jack. However, the camera is one of the best, it has IP67 dust and water resistance, HTC Sense is a light skin with extremely responsive performance, and it is priced hundreds less than competing flagships.. The 10 best smartphones of 2017. Apple and Google recently announced new 2017 phones, but even these phones can't surpass Samsung's latest Galaxy Note 8.. For those who like the HTC U11 or for those looking for a solid mid-ranger, the new HTC U11 Life is definitely one to consider. I've been using one on T-Mobile for over a week and it feels almost like I'm using an HTC U11 while being $200 less and a bit less fragile with shiny blue acrylic back.. The specs are mostly mid-level, but you will also find a pair of the USonic earbuds, that employ a customized audio setup with active noise cancellation, in the box for an amazing audio experience. The U11 Life is also IP67 dust and water resistant.. The liquid glass back made the U11 stand out from the pack and with the HTC U11 Life, we see a similar high gloss Sapphire Blue color for the back panel. To save costs and price the device in the sub-$400 range, this back panel is constructed of acrylic. It still looks good, but also makes it less susceptible to breaking if you drop it on the back. Sapphire Blue was one of the most popular colors of the HTC U11, and the HTC U Ultra before that, so it makes sense that the blue is the chosen color for the US release.. The flash and camera are centered near the top of the back with the HTC logo about in the center of the back. There is nothing on the left side while the power and volume buttons are on the right. The USB Type-C port is oddly positioned off to the far right on the bottom. The microSD card and SIM card slot is on the top.. The front is pretty basic, especially when you compare it to the screen dominant devices of today like the LG V30 and G6, Apple iPhone X, Samsung Galaxy S8 and Note 8, and other modern smartphones. There are bezels on the sides, top, and bottom. There are also two capacitive buttons, one on each side of the oblong fingerprint scanner/home button, below the display. HTC has been using this approach for a couple years now.. The display is Super LCD and it looks great with accurate colors and excellent clarity. Google Daydream is not supported by LCD screens though so you won't be using VR headsets with the HTC U11 Life.. Unfortunately, there is no standard 3.5mm headset jack on the HTC U11 Life, but I think it is time for me to stop listing that as a con since it seems to be the present and future for most smartphones. HTC still offers a stunning audio experience on a smartphone through the USB Type-C port. HTC includes USonic technology to scan your ear to customize the audio output for your unique ear design. Earbuds with active noise cancellation are included in the box and they will blow you away. I could only have the volume set to about 70 percent maximum most of the time as audio is loud, crisp, clear, and simply stunning.. The rear and front cameras are both 16 megapixel variants. You can check out some sample full resolution photos in my Flickr album to judge the camera for yourself. It does well and will likely meet the needs of most people looking to capture life's moments and share them on social networks.. HTC U11 Life review: in pictures. 1 - 5 of 11. The HTC U11 Life runs the Android 7.1.1 Nougat operating system with the August monthly security update present on my evaluation unit. HTC has a solid track record of updates for the OS and monthly security releases from Google. I expect to see Android O on this device in the near future.. The latest version of HTC Sense is present on the U11, but it is such a light "skin" that you cannot really distinguish it from stock Android. There is theme support, widgets, and a few other HTC custom features, but it is mostly a stock experience. This includes a lack of HTC duplicate apps like we have seen in the past as HTC continues to focus on providing Google apps for its users. I personally prefer HTC Gallery over Google Photos, but there are ways to get such apps if you try hard enough.. The HTC U11 Life works very well with Google Assistant's hands-free launch phrase. It also includes HTC Alexa, but a limitation of the Snapdragon 630 processor is the support for a single wake word. Thus, you have to launch the HTC Alexa app first before using the Amazon Alexa functionality.. The HTC U11 Life will be available SIM-unlocked on HTC.com for GSM carriers for $349. T-Mobile will launch it in carrier stores starting on November 3 for a price to be announced soon. It will appear as a T-Mobile Smart Pick and be prominently displayed to customers in stores. With its glossy blue back and low price, it is sure to attract customers.. The Moto X4 is similarly priced at $399.99 or $329.99 as an Amazon Prime Exclusive. The Moto G5S Plus is just $229.99 with a similar RAM and internal storage capacity. Many of these mid-range phones are comparable, but most lack NFC and Android Pay support too.. As a phone reviewer and guy who spends the majority of my time with high-end flagships, I was hoping to see the rumored HTC U11 Plus launch in the US. However, HTC isn't interested in cannibalizing possible HTC U11 sales so the US is seeing the more affordable HTC U11 Life launch as both an unlocked device and one that will be present in key locations in T-Mobile retail stores.. I think T-Mobile is the right carrier for this phone as people look for something affordable on one of the most cost-competitive carriers while also looking for a phone that stands out from the black and white slabes so prevalent today. The Sapphire Blue HTC U11 Life is attractive and the price is right.. To be honest, there is very little compromise in using the HTC U11 Life compared to the HTC U11 and I didn't really miss the U11 with the U11 Life in hand. Most of the time we see mid-rangers give up NFC, provide average cameras, or reduce the overall experience in some manner. I don't see that in the HTC U11 Life and it will be interesting to see if it appeals to the masses.. Fujitsu Lifebook E558 review: Configurable and well-connected.

It was Xiaomi that kicked off the midrange One devices, Moto joined with the X4 and now the HTC U11 Life is hot on their heels. Trendy design, a big and high-res screen, a reliable processor and a promising camera setup - all coated in vanilla Android Oreo.. Just like Xiaomi gave up its MIUI on the Mi A1 for pure Android, HTC has axed Sense on the U11 Life. With Google in charge of everything related to software, HTC had to only bring its audio drivers and squeeze gestures.. The U11 Life is coming from the maker of the Pixel 2, but unlike the U11+ which was once tipped to be a Pixel, the U11 Life has nothing to do with the Google series. Every U-series entry has the Liquid Surface design though, and the affordable Life model is keeping the stunning glass build and chameleon paint jobs.. The 5.2" LCD screen is quite comfortable for one-handed use, while the fresh Snapdragon 630 is here to replace the popular 625 with faster processor and graphics. The U11 Life also comes with the cool USonic noise-cancelling headphones and native support for hi-res audio. Last but not least, the phone may be booting on vanilla Oreo, but the entire Edge Sense functionality is available on the U11 Life.. The HTC U11 Life omits one prominent feature available on the other U11 phones, the BoomSound speakers. It comes with just a single speaker at the bottom and there is no proper audio jack either - the unwelcome trend is hitting the midrange now too. We have to finally accept defeat we guess.. We saw the Snapdragon 630 chip do a fine job in the Moto X4, so we have high hopes for the U11 Life's performance and battery backup. But before we put the U11 Life to the test, let's see what it's made of.. Retail package, 360-degree spin, design 3. Telephony, speaker, multimedia, audio quality 7.

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. Lenovo's Yoga 730 is a cheaper 2-in-1 with Alexa support. The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. Sony will sell its wireless 'open-ear' buds in the US. Tesla's electric trucks may be more cost-effective than expected. The HTC U11 Life crams flagship features into a cheaper body. These days, $349 gets you a lot of phone.. HTC's U11 was proof that the company still has some fight left in it, and now it's building new phones to pick up where the U11 left off earlier this year. The sweet new U11+ sadly isn't coming to the US, but its smaller sibling, the $349/£349 U11 Life, is set to land here this Friday. Now, HTC's more modest devices have had a hard time finding their footing in America, but the surprisingly capable U11 Life just might help with that.. When it comes to looks, the U11 Life is exactly what you'd expect: a shrunken version of the original. That's no small feat considering how much work HTC sank into getting these mirror-like, IP67 water resistant bodies just right. As a result, we're left with a reasonably priced smartphone that feels more expensive than it is. Some of the changes HTC made in shrinking the phone may actually improve the U11 design, too. Instead of glass, the U11 Life's back is covered in acrylic -- hopefully that means it won't crack as easily as the original U11 did.. Gallery: Hands-on with the HTC U11 Life | 9 Photos. Beyond that, there's a perfectly serviceable 5.2-inch full HD LCD screen, and it's flanked by the same big bezels that we saw on the U11. (If you were hoping HTC would cut back on the empty space around its screens, you'll need to check out the new U11+.) Colors on the display are bright and viewing angles are good as well; it's generally a good panel for the price.. Same goes for the phone's performance -- it uses a Snapdragon 630 chipset and 3GB of RAM to keep things running smoothly. Sure, you can throw the Life for a loop by playing some games with graphical settings cranked all the way, but so far it's been adept at answering Slack messages, triaging emails and playing Digimon Links. I haven't spent much time playing with either of the U11 Life's 16-megapixel cameras, though, so stay tuned for more on those.. All of the U11's gimmicks are here as well. In addition to Google's Assistant and the occasionally helpful Sense Companion, the U11 Life is one of the few phones that uses Alexa as a virtual concierge of sorts. You can launch it with a quick squeeze, too, since the U11 Life also has HTC's Edge Sense. Once enabled, the phone's pressure-sensitive sides can be used to launch apps and even perform specific actions inside of them. It takes a little getting used to, but it's much, much more flexible than Google's implementation in its new Pixels -- there, you can only use it to fire up Google Assistant.. Oh, and the U11 Life comes with HTC's uSonic earbuds, which adjust how audio sounds based on the shape of your ear and also draws power for its noise cancellation straight from the phone. It certainly helps that the Life also supports 24-bit high-res audio, a relative rarity for a device in this price range.. Building a $349 mid-range phone as nice as this is a big point of pride for the company, whose spokespeople admit to me that devices like the One A9 were too expensive for what they were. Not every decision the company made sits right with me, though. While there's a spot for a microSD card, it would've been nice to have more than 32GB of built-in storage. And here's the really strange bit: Here in the States, we'll get a version of the U11 Life running HTC's familiar Sense interface on top of Android Nougat. Everywhere else, the U11 Life will run a clean version of Oreo as specified by Google's Android One program. In other words, we're sort of getting shafted on software.. HTC representatives say the decision was ultimately all about timing; the company couldn't bake the Android One build into the US version of the U11 Life without delaying its launch, and I get the impression that HTC really wanted to get this thing out the door. There's no official word on whether the phone will ever be available in the US with stock Android, but hey, one can hope.. We're a little more curious about HTC's next big thing -- the U11+ doesn't count -- but the Life is an intriguing option for smartphone shoppers on a budget. It's not quite a flagship, but it's much closer than we had expected for the price.. android , gear , hands-on , htc , mobile , preview , senseui , smartphone , u11 , u11life.

The U11 Life is by no means a bad phone, and it’s a shame that a few software oddities completely ruin the experience. In every other way, it’s a decent piece of kit..

Combines some of the best features of the U11 and Android One series. It has a standout design, unmatched squeeze gestures and great battery life on top of a great screen and reasonably good performance. Not least, the two cameras, front and rear, are well above average too..

A simple and solid mid-range phone. Overall, the HTC U11 Life is a solid mid-range phone. Design and specs are largely decent for the price – especially getting 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM as standard. Meanwhile Android One keeps software clean and simple if that's what you're after..

The HTC U11 Life is a logical mid-level reflection of its already very capable flagship bigger brother. It's more attractive than some of its nearest competition, such as the Moto X4, while offering dust and water-resistance that few others deliver at this price point..

HTC U11 Life officially launching at T-Mobile on November 3rd. T-Mobile’s support pages spilled the beans on the HTC U11 Life a bit early, but today the news was made officially official: the U11 Life is coming to T-Mobile.. The HTC U11 Life will be available exclusively from T-Mobile starting tomorrow, November 3rd. Pricing will be set at $12 down and $12 per month for 24 months, which works out to a total price of $300.. HTC’s new smartphone features a 5.2-inch 1920×1080 Super LCD screen on its face along with a fingerprint reader below it and a 16-megapixel camera with f/2.0 aperture above it. Around back there’s a second 16-megapixel camera that includes phase detection autofocus, a pro mode with RAW support, and an f/2.0 aperture.. Inside the HTC U11 Life’s IP67 water resistant shell is a Snapdragon 630 processor that’s paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. There’s also a microSD card slot if you need additional storage. Powering the whole package is a 2600mAh battery, and to recharge that battery, the U11 Life has a USB Type-C port.. The HTC U11 Life supports LTE bands B1/B2/B3/B4/B5/B7/B12/B17/B13/B28/B20/B66. It also includes 2CA and 3CA as well as VoLTE and Wi-Fi Calling.. On the software side, the HTC U11 Life runs Android 7.1 below HTC’s custom Sense UI.. One of the highlight features of the HTC U11 Life is Edge Sense, which debuted on the flagship U11 earlier this year. With Edge Sense, you can squeeze the sides of the U11 Life to perform actions, like launching your camera app and then taking a photo.. It feels like it’s been awhile since we’ve seen an HTC phone on T-Mobile’s shelves, so it’s good to see the HTC U11 Life coming to T-Mo. It may not be a flagship-tier device, but having a devices available from a variety of manufacturers is a good thing, and now HTC hardware will be available from T-Mo once again..

So this will be T-mobile’s second phone with Band 66 support?. Band 66 is an extension of Band 4. Band 71 is the 600 mhz spectrum and this phone does not support it.. For the price it’s good deal, by the time we can fully utilize the 600 MHZ HTC U12 would be out by that time so I suggest getting usually HTC offer trade in offers for the older model. I wish they still kept the jack port I really don’t like carrying around adapters. Cross our fingers their cool accessories .. Or just hook the adapter onto your earring, lol.. Any chance for the U11+ coming to Tmobile?. HTC even said the U11+ is not even coming to the USA at all At least for now. This is the typical Western Hemisphere sad story for all phone makers from Samsung on down… we don’t get the best models. At best we get the Plus lesser storage & ram version, if at all.. So this or the X?. He’s saying this phone or the iPhone X. Seems like a nice midrange phone at a reasonable price. Something T-Mobile definitely needs in it’s lineup.. They have plenty of midrange phones already.. but this is the first that’s water resistant, front fingerprint sensor and excellent camera. Hopefully LG,ZTE,,will come out with midrange phone with 3 gigs of ram,like Lg Stlyo 4 plus,the next ZTE Max phone.. Wth happened to the original why would i want the ugly step sister when i could of had the gorgeous bombshell redhead xD seriously why no u11 or even u11+. TMo sales people won’t bother to show it to anyone.. Saw it tonight almost bought it till i saw it wasnt stereo so got the v30. Why? They show off LG and Samsung’s midrange phones. Why not do the same for HTC?. They never showed me any of the M series phones. Of course, this could be a local thing.. The consolation prize is not much of a consolation. The U11+ is what we want, the real Pixel 2 XL.. Pretty decent for a midrange phone. Cheaper than the Moto X4 and Zenfone 4 with practically the same specs.. I wish T-Mobile would carry more phones from Motorola besides the Z2 Force. It would be nice if they had the Moto X4 and the Moto G line, but those are only sold unlocked.. Verizon has a few Zenfones from Asus, so I’d like T-Mobile to carry those as well.. T-Mobile needs more phones from a variety of manufacturers. I was in a Verizon store the other day and they sold phones from Moto, Asus, and other brands that aren’t Samsung, Apple, or LG.. - Any - 3G|4G U301 USB Modem Acer Aspire One Netbook Acer Liquid M220

HTC U11 life Review By Hubert Nguyen on 11/15/2017 07:00 PST. The HTC U11 is one good-looking mid-tiers smartphone. Highs Slim and light Elegant design, low risk of cracks Excellent selfie camera. Lows Unimpressive main camera performance Smaller battery capacity. Rating and Price Rating: 8/10. Key Specifications 5.2” IPS LCD Display (1920×1080) 16 MP Camera, f/2.0 aperture, No OIS Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 platform, 3 RAM, 32GB of Storage 2600 mAh battery capacity Android 7.1.1 (until “late Nov 2017”), then Android 8.0 Industrial Design Comfort Build Quality Durability Ingenuity Display Brightness Camera Excellent Selfies "HTC U11 LIFE SELFIES BLOW AWAY THE COMPETITION" Camera technical analysis Software Battery Life A higher battery capacity Rapid charging Performance Conclusion. With a strong showing in the form of the HTC U11 , HTC now wants to trickle down the same kind of technology and design into the ~$350 price range, where there is typically more sales Android phones volume.. With a strong showing in the form of the HTC U11, HTC now wants to trickle down the same kind of technology and design into the ~$350 price range, where there is typically more sales Android phones volume.. The U11 Life was released on 2017/11/02 and was initially aimed at the mid-range market. At publishing time, the HTC U11 Life was priced at USD 349. With “cost” as principal criteria, we got an array of cell phones which will serve as reference points to assess how the HTC U11 Life fits in the smartphone landscape: the Honor 9 (~365 USD), Motorola Moto Z Play (~350 USD) and the Motorola Moto X4 (~400 USD).. Note : we have the U.S version of this handset. The International version may have slightly different technical specifications, although we would expect HTC to preserve the same overall experience as much as possible.. The Industrial design of the HTC U11 life is very agreeable to the eye. This is a matter of personal preference of course, but I thought that HTC did a great job of translating the original look and feel of the HTC U11, which is has a glass texture in the back, into the HTC U11 life, which has a plastic back cover. From a a feet or two away, the visual difference is not massive, and it is when you hold the device that the plastic “feel” against your skin becomes obvious.. This smartphone feels comfortable in hand because it has a width of 72.9 mm for a thickness of approximately (0.31 inches / 8.1 mm ). For reference, this is based on a medium size hand (US M gloves), you can try extrapolating from here. The weight of 142 grams (5.01 oz) makes it a light smartphone in this category. Plastic is light and durable, but even with a premium paint or surface treatment it just does not “feel” as good as metal or glass. However, plastic is lighter than metal and will not break, or even crack.. Plastic may be easier to scratch, but the damage is not always obvious as it might be on a metallic surface such as aluminum. After considering how the smartphone was built, we estimate that the risk of cracking during a landing on a hard surface to be low. You can refer to our reference article about how phones could be built to avoid breakage upon drops. Naturally, the screen can still crack, but neither the edges or the back cover are at high risk of breakage after a drop.. The U11 Life smartphone has an IP-rating , which means that it is protected to some degree from dust and water. Here’s what the U11 life’s IP67 rating means: d ust tight, no dust can penetrate. Up to 1-meter immersion for a limited duration will not harm the device. Since competitors often don’t have the IP67 rating, being able to survive a complete immersion in water is a significant design advantage over other phones in the same price range. We do know that many phones die from exposure to water, so this may save you from much trouble if that ever happens.. This handset design packs decent performance in relation to its size, but nothing unusual for a mid-range phone. From another standpoint, how much battery capacity the customer gets is below-average for a device of this size, with the competition clocking at 3200 mAh (Honor 9) and 3510 mAh of capacity, versus the HTC U11 life’s 2600 mAh .. The screen display-to-body ratio of 69.5% is also in-line with competitors, and most phones hover around a 69% to 70% ratio, which would be considered as “normal.” Keep in mind that an iPhone 8 has a 65.4% ratio, so being expensive is not always a factor here.. The U11 Life display has an IPS LCD panel. IPS/PLS LCD technology made LCD displays reach the next level, first on mobile, then everywhere else. IPS/PLS can render more colors than basic LCD, with higher color saturation and wider view angles. of the U11 life is sufficient, although it is not the sharpest possible in a phone. It is common for this price, and competitors will typically not try to enter an arms race.. Learn more : LCD vs. Within the world of IPS LCD displays there are still some differences, but frequently IPS/PLS are beyond basic LCD displays. However, IPS/PLS LCD displays as a whole are not as technologically edgy as OLED panels which often have better contrast and saturation.. While it is possible to build excellent LCD displays that perform at a comparable level to some OLED, these LCD displays should be seen as the exceptions, and they may not have any of the normal advantages associated with LCD (vs. You can read our complete LCD vs. The display brightness is 320 NITs (307 NITs measured). In general, more intense light is preferred to read the screen content on a sunny day (or bright environment). Higher brightness is responsible for better image quality in widespread situations. I found the display quality to be quite good and looking at colorful pictures is agreeable. Movies will look nice, and nothing from the display quality is distracting. The HTC U11 life camera takes good photos in daylight. I found them to be well-metered and the color balance is life-like. In low-light situations, things get more complicated, and while that is true for all phones, especially at mid-range prices. Still, I found that the HTC U11 life did not perform best within its category.. What’s a Great Mobile Camera Experience?. I did a test with an extreme low-light situation (10 Lux at the subject) to reveal the relative strengths and weaknesses of a few phones I had on hand. We have a few phones that are in the same price range, and the G5 Plus is even significantly cheaper at ~$230 (unlocked). Unfortunately, the HTC U11 life’s main camera did not perform so well.. As you can see in the low-light line up, the two Motorola phones do quite well. The Honor 5 is a bit better with noise reduction but could use more sharpness, and the HTC U11 life does not fare so well relatively to the rest. This is a bit of an extreme case, but so are plenty of parties, diners, and bars you might go to. Also, I cropped the image to show you a close up, but in the real world, and over social media, the difference is not as dramatic.. On the lower right, there’s a picture of the LG V30, just to show you what a high-end phone can do in such situations. Obviously, there is a very big difference, and that is essentially what several hundred dollars more will buy you…. In a weird twist, the selfie camera of the HTC U11 life blows away the competition in low-light (and in bright light too). The HTC U11 front camera is good at capturing the details and colors. In fact, it is even better than the LG V30’s selfie camera (which I grant, isn’t very good).. Of course, on top of this high image quality, you can add “beautifying” effects and any other things that people do with Selfies. HTC has done very well with the front camera.Technical details. Mobile cameras have become amazingly good over time. However, it is true that there is a huge difference between them based on cost, but also depending on technology and expertise of the handset maker.It is critical to realize that mobile imaging has two foundations of considerable importance: Software and Hardware. The software is usually very secretive, and it is extremely hard to have reliable insight to determine its quality via an unbiased process.. Also, photography is not just science, it is also art.. The camera equipment is the other factor which is more measurable. Camera hardware is potentially a substantial limiting factor to mobile camera performance. Even if you use the best algorithms on it, the quality of the input signal data still plays a major role in the final photo outcome.. In the U11 Life, the camera aperture of f/2.0 is common in this category, and the sensor size of ~16.5 mm2 would be considered to be a normal size (for a smartphone) at this price level. For comparison, some high-end handsets can have double the sensing surface, but these phones cost several hundred dollars more.. The 16 Megapixel count should not be used as a general proxy of photo quality. In dim lighting situations, the high Megapixel count (>12) does not matter much. Keep in mind that the physical size of each sensor pixel is important.. With higher megapixel counts, sensing pixels (sensels) may have to be smaller. Each sensel obtains less light information and in dark conditions, it is better for the overall image quality to gather more light with fewer (but bigger) sensels than the opposite. It is a balance that needs to be achieved.. Today, 12 Megapixel seem to be the best sensor trade-off between sharpness, low-light and auto-focus performance.On a sunny day or in very bright light situations, Megapixel could be a good proxy for photographic detail and sharpness.. For example, on a sunny day, a landscape photo with a higher megapixel count could lead to finer details. Between 12 MP, 16 MP and 21 MP differences in small details can be quite noticeable, if printed or viewed on a large and/or high-PPI display.. The U11 Life’s camera does NOT have Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) on the primary camera module. The lack of OIS support will decrease the chances to take great photos, especially in low-light situations. That said, the competition does not have OIS either.. Learn more : What is Image Stabilization?. OIS helps to achieve better image clarity and higher low-light performance by offsetting tiny hand-shaking motion. OIS makes it possible to leave the shutter open longer to gather more light (longer exposure). Optical and digital stabilization are entirely different, with digital stabilization suitable to help video recording smoothness. The autofocus of the U11 Life camera is based on Phase Detection technology. Phase-detection AF that was originally built into specific AF sensor chips in the DSLR days. Then it got integrated into the camera primary sensor.. It works by adding specialized AF pixels sensors that would tell if specific points in the image were in-focus.. This method is very advanced, and the AF capabilities work well in most cases. AF performance is more or less proportional to the number of hardware AF sensels. Typically this number can go from dozens to hundreds of Phase-Detection AF points.. Phase detection AF is an excellent system, which is only inferior to Dual-Pixel AF. Some competitors rely on the inferior contrast-based AF, maybe assisted with a laser range finder.. There is no dual-camera setup to assist with Portrait Mode (out of focus areas blurred, aka “Bokeh”). The absence of this feature is not yet a significant issue for mid-range phones because even the high-end cameras aren’t executing this flawlessly. However, if you really like Portrait Mode, some competitors such as the Honor 9 do offer the feature.. Learn more : Dual Cameras vs. As Android grew to be a mature platform, HTC has scaled down its custom user interface and has gotten closer to a pure Google Experience over time. The U.S version doesn’t ship with Android 8.0 Oreo, although an upcoming firmware update should fix that this month.. There are a couple of things that you should not miss in the HTC U11 life. First, it has the Squeeze functionality introduced with the HTC U11. It works by having pressure sensors on either side of the phone. As you squeeze it with your hand, it activates a function like the digital Assistant or something else (flashlight, camera). Secondly, the HTC U11 life ships with Alexa and Google Assistant, so you can pick whichever you prefer. The only caveat, for now, is that only Google Assistant can be voice-activated with the “OK Google” command. This is because the always-on voice listener has a limited amount of memory and computing power to detect the activation word, so only one is available. A choice had to be made…. The battery capacity of U11 Life is 2600 mAh , which is decent in general, and below-average in its own category.Battery life is one of the most essential features of a smartphone. A key metric is, of course, the battery capacity — especially within the same ecosystem (Android, iOS or other). As it stands, you can find better battery capacity in other phones similarly priced.. Battery life can be affected by a bunch of factors, but the main ones are the central processor, display and wireless radios (broadband, WiFi, the cell towers location and more). It is impossible to precisely estimate through synthetic tests how much energy drain YOUR unique usage pattern will induce. However, two things are undeniably always good:. It is generally impossible to predict real-life battery life by running synthetic tests. Things such as display brightness, (LTE/WiFi) radio usage and distance to access points will change too much. Also, how many apps on-board and their activity is unpredictable.. Battery capacity is the most crucial battery-life indicator for YOUR usage.This product does NOT have a swappable battery, which is the norm for a smartphone nowadays. Closed batteries cannot be taken out or easily repaired, but they do allow for smaller designs and slightly larger battery capacity inside the same product size.. This handset has a relatively common screen resolution. Although this may be less competitive from an image quality perspective, having fewer pixels to compute is a good thing for battery life.. Before you look at the charts, it is important to realize that most benchmarks are only loose indicators, usually for system or graphics performance. It is possible to see sharp performance gaps between different classes of devices (entry-level, mid-range vs. high-end), but it is much harder to do so within handsets of the same class. Benchmarks alone should NOT lead to a smartphone purchase decision.. What do they mean? Learn more : Are more CPU cores always better? Optimize : How to Speed Up Android Phones. Gaming performance benchmarks (GFXBench) apply only to complex applications using 3D graphics. Casual apps like puzzles and 2D games do not require this kind of power and can run pretty much on any modern smartphone. Synthetic CPU performance (Geekbench) shows a rosy picture of peak general computing performance, but in the real world, it is very difficult to reach and sustain peak levels.. The HTC U11 life performance is very much in-line with what we would expect from a mid-range phone. In terms of computing power, it is more than enough for Social media, light multimedia, and general productivity activities. However, it is not a phone that is capable of playing modern 3D games at high frame-rates. 2D games and puzzles should be fine. That said, for a similar price, the Honor 9 brings much more computing power.. The HTC U11 life is a good-looking Android phone that is very light, compact and has the squeeze action, just like the new Google Pixel 2 high-end phone. These are all excellent reasons to consider or buy one — and don’t forget the excellent selfie photo quality.. If you are looking for more battery or a better rear camera for the price, there are probably good options at this level. Battery capacity is a ferocious factor in lower budget phones because it is the #1 feature for many people.. Also, if you want a more advanced camera experience, handsets such as the Honor 9 would provide a better experience and photo quality, for a comparable price. The design is very different, and it is not clear when that phone would get the Android One update. HTC has promised to deliver it to the HTC U11 life “this month” (November 2017) ..
