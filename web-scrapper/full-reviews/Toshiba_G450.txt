It is very small (98 x 36 x 16 mm) and plugs in a USB port to function as a modem. The G450 has only a OLED display and a 160MB of built-in memory.. Toshiba G450 Official Page Hands-on with Toshiba G450. Design Dimensions: 3.85 x 1.41 x 0.62 inches (98 x 36 x 16 mm). Weight: 2.01 oz (57 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Resolution: 96 x 39 pixels. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Battery Talk time: 2.20 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 8.3 days (200 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Cellular GSM: 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

The company does make mobiles, but these days it’s probably better known in the UK for its Windows Mobile toting handhelds.. I wonder how much the new G450 will change that. Certainly it challenges perceived wisdom about what a mobile phone should look like. And Toshiba is also really talking the phone’s functions up suggesting it is a ‘unique four-in-one innovative mobile device’ being a mobile phone, HSDPA USB modem, MP3 player and USB data storage device.. Putting the marketing aside, though, the G450 is certainly an eye-catcher. If you recall my review of the Liscio that mobile phone has a similar shape, but the G450 puts even the Liscio’s innovative design to shame.. The tri-band HSDPA G450 is a small, rounded lozenge of a mobile measuring just 98mm tall, 36mm wide and 16mm thick. It is probably the lightest mobile phone I have ever come across at just 57g too.. The front fascia comprises three circles. The middle and bottom ones house the number pad, the upper one the screen. The number pad circles are brilliantly backlit white when the phone is switched on.. Now, this may sound as cool as the coolest thing you’ve ever seen, or you may be left feeling cold by the design. But whatever you’re feeling let me assure you that both screen and numberpad are the devil incarnate to use till you are accustomed to the unusual systems in place.. As far as the numberpad is concerned the two circles separate the number keys in a most unfriendly way. The 1 to 6 keys are in the upper circle, with 7-9, 0 and the * and # keys in the bottom circle. The positioning of the keys meant that it took a while to get used to both number dialling and texting. In fact throughout the review period I never felt fully happy with the idiosyncratic positioning.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network. 
Press enter or click on the search icon. Like the numberpad the screen is similarly odd. Its OLED display offers 96 x 39 pixels which makes it small by anybody’s standards. There are only three lines for display, and the top one is taken up with status information. This leaves just two for things like incoming SMS messages, so the phone isn’t exactly brimming with information delivery potential. In fact, you’ll need to scroll to read any SMS message of more than about five or six words.. And getting round applications and menus is a bit of a challenge too. You have to use the two side rockers, one on the left side of the phone and one on the right. These have a wide range of functions depending on where you are in the phone at the time. For example, the right rocker doubles to offer Call and End functions and turns the handset on and off.. The left is used as a volume rocker and profile changer as well as a shortcut to SMS creation and the music player, depending on where you press it and where you are in the phone. I’d choose dedicated buttons any day over having to remember all the various roles a single button can have. These buttons flank the screen, and I never did find an easy way of accessing both at once.. I tried holding the phone in my right hand and using my thumb for the right rocker and index finger for the left rocker, but that was uncomfortable. I tried holding the phone in both hands and using forefinger and thumb combinations, but that felt squished and was difficult when standing up on the bus! I tried laying the phone on my desk and prodding at the buttons. It worked OK, but is, obviously enough, only possible some of the time.. Despite Toshiba’s enumeration of what this phone can do – to recap; HSDPA USB modem, USB data storage and music playback – the G450 is also notable for what it can’t do.. There is no camera, which might come as a surprise to those looking at its £150 SIM-free price, and no mobile email either. The lack of the latter is probably a blessing in disguise given the small screen, but with mobile email pretty much supported by all phones above mid-range its absence is a surprise..

The Bottom Line The Toshiba G450 is certainly an interesting device; there's nothing quite like it on the market. It works well as a modem, but is too fiddly to use as a normal phone, so its appeal will be limited. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Toshiba is not a name that we'd readily associate with mobile phones, but then this handset is not really your typical mobile phone. Instead, Toshiba is pitching the G450, which costs around £150 SIM-free, at those who want a HSDPA modem for their PC that has more functionality than the typical mobile broadband USB dongle.. The G450 is nothing if not striking. At just 98mm tall and 36mm wide, it's slightly smaller than a Milky Way bar. Its light too at just 57g, but what really makes it stand out from the crowd is the oddball design. The face comprises of there circles. The top one houses the tiny OLED screen, while the bottom two contain the number keys. These keys are backlit so they're easy to read even in complete darkness. The call quality is also surprisingly good considering the phone's small size, with both the mic and speaker delivering clear speech.. Most people, however, will buy the G450 to use with their PC or laptop as a HSDPA modem and in this regard, it performs well. When you plug it into your PC via the supplied USB lead it automatically installs the Toshiba Wellphone XT software.. Once you've entered the settings for your particular mobile network, you just click on the mobile Internet button and within a matter of seconds you'll be on the Web. The modem supports speeds of up to 3.6Mbps, but the achievable data rates will vary from network to network. We managed to get around 1.6Mbps out of it in London using our test SIM.. Hot Products.

Home > Phones >. Phone reviews > Toshiba phone reviews. As a phone, it lacks many of the basic features you’d expect, but as a mobile broadband dongle, it does so much more Read full. WellPhone XP application simple to use. Toshiba are not known for their mobile phones, and at first glance, the G450 appears to demonstrate why. A succinct quote comes to mind: "What are you?", although the reply here isn’t "I’m Batman". The question is still valid so we take a closer look to find out what it is.. Out of the box you expect to find a mobile phone but the form factor sends you into a spin. Looking like a bloated USB stick (98 x 36 x 16mm), there are three round sections on the front, the top is a screen, the other two divide your normal number pad buttons between them: 1-6 on the top, 7-0, * and # on the bottom. On the left- and right-hand sides of the device you’ll find two rocker keys which are your calling buttons, volume, as well as navigation for the menus.. The screen is a 96 x 39 pixel OLED display, which basically gives you a few lines of information: across the top is the standard phone status information and then a couple of lines for navigation of menus, messages and so on. As far as mobile phones go, this is probably the smallest screen around offering the least functionality.. The arrangement of buttons across the two circles on the face of the device takes some getting used to but is not impossible to use – and with T9 support, you can happily bash out a few quick text messages. The volume control doubles up as a shortcut key, accessing your address book or opens a new text message, which saves diving into the menu which is tricky to navigate at best.. But the G450 is not really a phone, and the indicator of that is written down the side: Qualcomm 3G CDMA. Your first instinct is that the screen is too small to access the Internet on the go, and then the penny drops. It’s not a phone, it’s a mobile internet dongle, with a phone built-in. Connect it to your computer and the onboard WellPhone XT installs. WellPhone is not the cleanest of software packages, but is a fairly powerful tool. Connect your G450 via USB and you have a range of functions available. First is the standard mobile internet option, it will simply dial-up and away you go.. We tried the G450 with two SIM cards, firstly straight out of our mobile phone on Orange, and secondly a SIM harvested from a 3 USB mobile broadband dongle, both worked fine, as you'd expect. The consideration here is the connection with your operator and how much you’ll have to pay depending on how you use the device.. There are also a number of contact and message management tools in WellPhone, which are similar in appearance to Outlook, so it is simple to navigate. It finds your Outlook contact automatically, meaning you can throw them straight into the G450’s memory. You can also manage the contacts on your SIM card. In addition you can write SMS messages to send via your phone, as well as read new messages and browse sent items and so on, just like an email system.. The G450 makes much more sense in this context as things suddenly start working when connected to your PC. The WellPhone XT application also provides shortcuts to your default email and browser, so you can punch the button and the phone will connect to the Internet whilst your application launches, so you are ready to do whatever it was you wanted.. You can use your G450 as an MP3 player and a standard USB data stick. Simply drag and drop the files from your PC.. Connection to the G450 is via the Mini-USB on the bottom of the device and the supplied headphones have to connect through there; they are not very good from an audio point of view, but they double up as the handsfree headset as well.. Overall the Toshiba G450 is an interesting concept, but one that is likely to have limited appeal. As a mobile broadband dongle it needs to use a cable to connect rather than having a plug built-in, plus you pay a fair whack for the device – more than you would a dongle from an operator. That said, if you can get yourself a SIM that will give you the data requirements you need without ongoing contract costs, then a balance could be struck.. As a phone, it lacks many of the basic features you’d expect – no camera, a tiny screen, no Bluetooth – but connected to a PC it becomes a lot more manageable (but not unique as many mobile phone suites offer the same functions). But if you only ever use your phone for making calls, and need an HSDPA modem, then this may just fit the bill without have to carry two devices.. As Aristotle was reported to have said "There was never a genius without a tincture of madness", and somewhere flitting between the two is the Toshiba G450..

I asked Toshiba,for the serial, but so far have not responded...... Join Date Feb 2009. I didnÂ´t find any serial, Probably we need wait until Toshiba solves this problem.. Join Date Feb 2009. This device is a complete waste of time. I was sold this last Friday by Expansys UK. The software on it is dated 2007. Toshiba know full well that it doesn't work with Vista yet they continue to ship it without updated firmware. Expansys UK are a complete waste of time too. It was the first time I have ever used them and I just spoke to a girl on the phone and said why where they shipping a device that clearly does not work with Vista and her reply was "Well it works with XP". I'll just go out a get a whole new system with XP on just so I can use my cr@ppy Toshiba modem. Shame they didn't mention this on the product page when I bought it.. Join Date Feb 2009. Hello, it's true,but with Vista works only with Wellphone 3.7.662, that is the demo...you do not have a serial number to be able to do the upgrade of this software,or if you know where to download it...tnx. I'm sorry,as you can see the firmware version and know that there are two versions of a modem, a 3.6 Mbps, the other from 7.2 Mbps. Join Date Feb 2009. It's true that version 3.7 of Wellphone software will work on Vista (tested in Home premium and Ultimate) with latest framework installed. But that doesn't solve our problem: G450 ships with a version that doesn't work, or even worse, that doesn't install at all. Wellphone support says to upgrade to 3.7. We don't have no serial number!!. Should we pay for the new version? Don't think so!. Toshiba support (as one would expect) just hides. Why has not anyone from Toshiba shown up in this thread?. Give us a serial to upgrade!. A very sad and disappointed customer. Join Date Feb 2009. Has anyone tried to install the modem directly in Vista?. Join Date Feb 2009.
