Key Specifications Mediatek MT6582M processor 1 GB RAM, 8 GB ROM RAM 8 GB, 1 GB RAM internal storage 1500 mAh battery battery 5 MP, LED flash rear & VGA selfie 4.0 inches inch screen Dual Sim, GSM + WCDMA Android OS, v4.4.2 (KitKat). Xolo Q510s Price starts at Rs. Xolo released the Xolo Q510s in September 2014 as an entry-level Android smartphone with dual-SIM capabilities. It features a 4-inch IPS LCD display, a 1.3GHz quad-core MT6582M processing unit, 1GB RAM, 8GB storage, 5MP primary camera, VGA secondary camera, Android 4.4 KitKat, and 1,500 mAh battery. This device can be seen as a slight upgrade when compared to the Xolo Q500s due to increased RAM and internal storage space. The Xolo Q510s was officially released in India with a price tag of Rs. The Q510s has a sleek metal-finish body with rounded corners, and a golden coloured strip running around the device. The black coloured front holds the display, navigational capacitive keys, front-facing camera, a couple of sensors, and an earpiece. The power button has been laid out on the right and the volume rocker is on the right hand side of the device. The metallic-finished back can be removed using the provided latch. The camera, an LED flash, and the loudspeaker are on the backside of the device. Mass storage card, SIM card, and the battery can be replaced after removing the back.. The 4-inch IPS LCD display has a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels, so its pixel density comes to around 233 pixels per inch.

Mobiles / XOLO Mobile Phones / XOLO Q510s Price in India. User Visits: 1 Launch Date in India: 17 August, 2014 Compare. What would you do if you wanted to buy a new smartphone but do not want to spend highly on the same? Chances are you will be heading for Moto G. What if you do not want to spend even that much? There is high probability that you will be heading for either Asus Zenfone 4(for price conscious), Motorola Moto E or Micromax Unite 2(for Android 4.4.2 KitKat). What if you want an alternative to all that is available? Well, Xolo has an answer in the Q510s. The Xolo Q510s features a 1.3GHz quad-core processor along with 1GB RAM. A 4-inch screen with display resolution of 800x480 pixels can be found on the Q510s. There is 8GB onboard storage capacity on the Q510s and it can be expanded up to 32GB by using a microSD card. A 5-megapixel and a 0.3-megapixel camera can be found on the back and the front of the Q510s respectively. The Q510s runs on Android 4.4.2 KitKat and can handle two SIM cards as well. A 1500mAH capacity battery powers the Xolo Q510s and should last for 15 hours of talktime. Xolo's dream run continues with the Q510s as the smartphone has been positioned, price-wise, between the Asus Zenfone 4 and Motorola Moto E/Micromax Unite 2. While the phone does not have as big a screen as the Moto E or unite 2, it is cheaper than the two. While it costs more than the Asus Zenfone 4, it comes packed with Android 4.4.2 KitKat. As such, it offers better build quality than the Zenfone 4 and may be even better than the Unite 2. It is only bested by the Moto E and that is something to say about the Xolo's offering. It is difficult to pick one device from the ones we are talking about as they all prove a point or two in their favour, the Xolo Q510s would make you consider it at least once before purchasing a budget smartphone.. 3.4 /5 (35 User Reviews). 3,500 (Expected Price) XOLO Q510s is currently not available in any online store..

The Xolo Q510s is a low-end device with Android 4.4.2. It features 4" display, 1.3 GHz quad core CPU, 1 GB RAM, 8 GB storage, microSD slot, 5 MP rear and VGA front camera.. Dimensions: 5.04 x 2.48 x 0.35 inches (128 x 63 x 8.98 mm). Resolution: 480 x 800 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Face detection, Smile detection, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 15.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 16.2 days (390 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 7.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 13.3 days (320 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Data: HSDPA+ (4G) 21.1 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s, UMTS. Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..
