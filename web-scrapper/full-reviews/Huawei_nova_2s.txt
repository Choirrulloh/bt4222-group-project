Huawei Nova 2S: Everything you need to know. The new Huawei Nova 2S has a dual-lens camera on the back and the front. Huawei has introduced the Huawei Nova 2S smartphone. A follow up to the Huawei Nova 2 series from earlier in 2017, which in turn was a sequel to the original Huawei Nova from 2016; the Nova 2S is so far only launched in China. The Nova series was released internationally, though, so there is a chance Huawei will put the Nova 2S on sale elsewhere in the future.. Here’s everything you need to know about the Huawei Nova 2S.. The Huawei Nova 2S’s announcement comes at a very busy time for the group as a whole. It follows the Huawei Mate 10 Pro’s release, and comes just days after the Honor 7X and Honor View 10 launched in Europe and the United States. What makes the Nova 2S stand out? It has four camera lenses.. Huawei continues to tempt us with a strong camera. The Nova 2S has a dual-lens camera with a 20-megapixel and a 16-megapixel lens on the back — one shooting in RGB and the other in monochrome. Doubled up they take cool bokeh-style shots, and used on its own, the monochrome lens will take stunning black and white images.. It’s not just the rear camera that has two lenses: The selfie camera does too. A 2-megapixel secondary lens joins a 20-megapixel main lens, adding the same ability to adjust the focal subject in a photo that we’re used to with dual-lens rear cameras. In a promotional video , Huawei also shows how this can be used to change the background in a selfie. There’s also a selfie flash unit.. Like all the previously mentioned new phones, the Huawei Nova 2S is another with an 18:9 aspect ratio screen, shrinking the bezels around it for a big-screen, small body design. It’s a 6-inch screen on the front with a 2160 x 1080 pixel resolution, and like the View 10, a fingerprint sensor is underneath it, rather than on the back like the Huawei Mate 10 Pro. The body looks beautiful in the pictures, especially in the light blue color, and has a glass rear panel. It’s slim at 7.5mm and light at 169 grams.. This isn’t a flagship phone, so the Kirin 970 processor with all its cool artificial intelligence hasn’t been used in the Nova 2S. Instead it’s last year’s Kirin 960 with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM. A choice of 32GB, 64GB, or 128GB in a special edition version of the phone is offered, plus there is a MicroSD card slot. Other features include a 3,340mAh battery, a 3.5mm headphone jack, Android 8.0 Oreo with EMUI 8, and face unlock using the selfie camera.. The special edition Huawei Nova 2S is a collaboration between Huawei and Chinese singer Yixing Zhang a.k.a Lay. The design appears to be the same as the other models, but may only be available in a single obsidian black color. Expect custom wallpapers, icons, and other visual features. Huawei has worked with Yixing Zhang before, including on the Nova 2 .. The Huawei Nova 2S was made official on December 7 at an event in China, with pre-orders open through the Vmall online store between December 8 and December 11. There are three different configurations of the phone, all at different prices. The cheapest has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage space for 2,700/$410 yuan, while a 6GB/64GB version is 3,000 yuan/$453. The most expensive Nova 2S is 3,400 yuan/$510 and has 6GB of RAM and 128GB storage space.. Huawei has outdone itself with the color choice. The glass body shines in blue, black, red, gold, and a silver gray.. There’s no news on an international release for the Nova 2S yet, but we’ll keep you updated if anything changes.. Update: Now the Huawei Nova 2S has launched, we’ve added in all the specifications and official images.. Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro are here — with some strange differences.

The phone also gets its first hands-on, despite its unofficial status.. It will be unveiled on December 7 (tomorrow). The video starts off with an unboxing, starring a charger, cable and a headset.. The phone comes with Android 8.0 Oreo  Huawei has been great in providing the latest software  while the power is supplied by a Kirin 960, the chipset used in the P10 and Mate 9 flagships. And its hooked up to 6GB of ram, an upgrade over the base Nova 2. Storage is 64GB total, 48GB user available.. As you can see in the next video, the screen has 1,080 x 2,160px resolution (18:9) and while the About screen doesnt say, rumors peg the diagonal at 6. This will fit nicely between the new Honor View 10 and Honor 7X.. There are two cameras above the screen  20MP + 2MP allegedly. Add to that two more on the back of the phone (20MP + 16MP). Check back tomorrow for official specs and launch info.. New leak offers pictures, price of the Huawei Nova 2S. Huawei Nova 2S unveiling set for next week.

Imagine some of us who wants under 140mm (and I still have a 130mm thanks to Sony).. Now, to repeat my question: can anyone make a decent phone under 150 mm, preferably under 145? Not everyone want these giants, with or without bezels.. Huawei has improved alot recently not only do they update flagships they update their mid rangers as well mate8 was probably the last huawei with bad updates hinor 8 got updated to nougat and is rumored to get oreo as well.

The Huawei Nova 2S goes official with a 6-inch 18:9 display and four cameras. by Matt Adams December 7, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. The changes don’t stop with the specs, though. Huawei jumped firmly on the 18:9 display bandwagon with a 6-inch 2160 x 1080 display. The Honor 2S is one of the first phones we’ve seen hit the market to incorporate an 18:9 display and the small bezels that tend to come with them,Â. and a physical home button that houses a fingerprint sensor.. Hot on the heels of a successful launch of the Honor V10 , Huawei is taking wraps off another device. The Huawei Nova 2S has justÂ. launched in China and sports a 6-inch 18:9 display and a 20 MP front-facing camera. The Nova lineup of phones straddles the line between mid-tier the value flagship territory.. The Nova 2S follows up last year’s Nova and Nova Plus. Those phones featured 5-inch and 5.5-inch displays, respectively. Both had 32 GB of storage, 3 GB of RAM, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processors. The Nova 2S bumped those internals to 64 or 128 GB of storage, 4 or 6 GB of RAM, and a Huawei-made Kirin 960 processor .. What is the LG G6’s 18:9 aspect ratio all about? – Gary explains. Now that LG has launched the G6 we have a couple of new phrases to add to our vocabularies, "18:9 aspect ratio" and "FullVision". So what is an aspect ratio? What is 18:9? Why isn't â¦. Customers will find a dual camera on the back of the phone that houses a 16 MP RGB sensor and a 20 MP monochrome sensor with an f/1.8 aperture. The show-stealer here may be the 20 MP front-facing camera. It has an f/2.0 aperture, an LED flash, and a secondary 2 MP sensor. The rest of the specs include a 3,340 mAh battery that supports fast charging, hybrid dual-SIM card support (two SIM cards or one SIM card + one microSD card ), and a 3.5 mm headphone jack.

We began hearing about the Huawei Nova 2S a few days ago,. when Huawei started sending invites for a press event. It was rumored to be an upgraded version of the Nova 2 and Nova 2 Plus phones that launched earlier this year, and those rumors turned out to be well-founded .. The Huawei Nova 2S packs a 6-inch Full HD+ 18:9 display with edge-to-edge bezels and ultra-wide. Kirin 960 chipset from Huawei’s HiSilicon chip division, and a Mali G71MP8 graphics chip.. The back of the Huawei Nova 2S has a 20MP main camera paired with a 16MP secondary (both with a f/1.8 aperture), and the front houses a secondary set of dual cameras — one with a 20MP sensor and a 2MP sensor (with f/2.0 apertures) — that support Huawei’s Face Unlock authentication. Huawei managed to squeeze in a fingerprint sensor in the front chin bezel, and a 3,340mAh battery with fast charging capabilities (9V / 2A) under the hood. (It can charge 50 percent in 30 minutes.) And the Nova S2 doesn’t disappoint in terms of connectivity — it’s got a USB Type-C port and a. 3.5mm audio jack, which is no doubt music to the ears of folks with legacy headphones.. The Nova S2 comes in blue, pink, gray, black, and red color options, and will ship in a number of configurations when it launches in China the week of December 12.

Huawei Nova 2S Unveiled: 18:9 display & dual front-facing cameras. The Nova 2S comes with a 6-inch 18:9 display, up to 6GB RAM, and a total of four cameras.. Over the past month, Huawei has announced the Mate 10/Mate 10 Pro , Honor View 10 , and Honor 7X. As if that wasn't enough, we now have the Huawei Nova 2S that was just announced in China. The Nova 2S is the successor to last year's Nova and Nova Plus , and for a price of around $400 USD, there's a lot of phone being offered here.. Starting up front with the display, you're looking at a 6-inch 2160 x 1080 screen with the trendy aspect ratio of 18:9. The bezels surrounding this screen are pretty slim, but Huawei still somehow managed to cram in a front-facing home button/fingerprint sensor. At the top of the phone is where you'll find the Nova 2S's front-facing camera s. There's a 20MP main sensor with an f/2.0 aperture and secondary 2MP one backed up by an LED flash, so your selfies should look pretty incredible.. You'll also find dual cameras around back, with the setup here consisting of a 16MP color sensor and 20MP monochrome one with an aperture of f/1.8.. Powering the Nova 2S is the Kirin 960 processor, 4 or 6GB RAM, and a 3,340 mAh battery. Other specs include 64 or 128GB of storage, dual-SIM and microSD card support, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box.. You'll be able to get the Nova 2S in Black, Gray, Red, Blue, and Rose Gold, and for 4GB RAM and 64GB storage, you'll pay 2699 yuan (around $400 USD).. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev. 
Submit a Tip / Contact Us. Huawei Nova 2s brings Oreo, 18:9 display, gorgeous colors, and four. Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Reddit. Huawei’s hardware has shined for years, and the company seems to just keep getting better and better. Today, the company is revealing its latest device, the Huawei Nova 2s.. The best gifts for Android users. The Nova 2s sits in between a standard flagship and a mid-range device, packing a 6-inch 1080p 18:9 display and last year’s Kirin 960 chipset. However, that’s paired with up to 6GB of RAM and up to 128GB of storage, as well as Android Oreo and dual-cameras.. Huawei’s two cameras in this case come in with a 16MP primary sensor and a 20MP secondary monochrome sensor. The company is also doubling down on cameras on this phone, including a 20MP front shooter with a 2MP secondary camera, presumably for Portrait selfies (w/ LED flash).. The company also made clear that the Nova 2s supports Face Unlock, just like the recently announced Honor V10 .. Rounding out the phone, Huawei has included USB-C, a 3,340 mAh battery, and SuperCharge fast charging which can fill up 50% in just 30 minutes.. The icing on the cake with the Nova 2s is the hardware. There’s a glass back akin to some previous devices , but notably in unique colors. There’s the standard black, gold, and grey, which all look great, but red and blue are the impressive ones here. The red option is a deep color with matching rails, while the blue is a light color that looks a lot like one of Honor’s limited color choices .. Pricing for the Nova 2s depends on the model you buy, starting at the equivalent of $407 for the 4GB/64GB model. Adding about $120 gets the 6GB/128GB model (via GSMArena ). There’s no word on if this device will be sold outside of China.. Check out 9to5Google on YouTube for more news:. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!.

How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. Huawei Nova 2s brings two cameras front and back. JC Torres - Dec 8, 2017. Huawei may have finally gotten its 2017 flagships out the door, but it hasn’t stopped its flow of new smartphones yet. It has just announced a new model in China, the Nova 2s, that further blurs the boundaries between premium flagship and mid-range phones. Mixing last year’s high-end specs with some of this year’s trends, the Huawei Nova 2s give some Chinese buyers pause to consider yet another contender for this year.. The Huawei Nova 2s is clearly a 2017 smartphone by the way it uses “double-sided glass” as its primary design cue. And, of course, there’s the dual cameras on the back. But what really pins it down is the 6-inch 18:9 screen, 2160×1080 Full HD+ of course.. Inside is a bit of a mixed bag. The Kirin 960 has already been supplanted by the 970 in the Huawei Mate 10, but the Huawei P10 from earlier this year still uses it. The 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage combo is an early 2017 configuration, but there’s also an option for 6 GB of RAM. The 3,340 mAh battery is definitely more than what most of the more expensive phones offer.. What’s notable about the Nova 2s is that it also has a dual camera on the front. That said, unlike the typical Huawei RGB and monochrome combo on the back, the front camera only has a 20 megapixel and 2 megapixel pair, both with a lower f/2.0 aperture.. As with most of Huawei’s phones, no word when or even if the Nova 2s will launch outside of China. There, the smartphone will sell for 2,699 RMB ($410) for the base 4 GB RAM/64 GB storage configuration all the way up to 3,499 RMB ($530) for 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. Definitely higher than your usual mid-range.. Topics Android huawei Phones smartphone. Lenovo Flex 14 is a 2-in-1 for the budget-minded. Lenovo Yoga 730 packs Alexa and Cortana into the same 2-in-1.

WiFi, Hotspot/Tethering, GPS, Bluetooth, Image Stabilization, Flash. 156.9 x 75.1 x 7.5 mm. Huawei nova 2S goes official with quad cameras and Android 8.0 Oreo. Huawei recently announced its latest camera-centric smartphone, the nova 2S, in its home country, China. The newly-launched device comes with quad cameras, 18:9 display, Kirin 960 chipset, and Android 8.0 Oreo on board.. Following the launch of the Honor V10 in Europe roughly a week ago, Huawei has recently announced yet another top-tier smartphone offering, the Huawei nova 2S in its home country, China. The Huawei nova 2S is widely known for being the company's newest camera-centric gadget. Usually, we only get a phone with a dual camera setup on either the back or front side. Apparently, why would you choose between the two if you can have both in one handset?. The nova 2S features a dual 20-megapixel + 2-megapixel front-facing camera setup with an f/2.0 aperture. There's a dual-camera setup on the back panel as well, comprised of a 16-megapixel RGB sensor and a 20-megapixel monochrome lens, having an aperture of f/1.8.. Regarding the specs, the Huawei nova 2S sports a 5.99-inch display with a resolution of 2160 x 1080 pixels, an aspect ratio of 18:9, and a 2.5D curved glass on top. Under the hood, it has the one-year-old Kirin 960 chipset and three memory configurations: 4 GB RAM + 64 GB storage, 6 GB RAM + 64 GB storage, and 6 GB RAM + 128 GB storage.. All of the storage variants come with support for an expandable memory via microSD card. The device runs on Android 8.0 Oreo-based EMUI 8.0 skin out-of-the-box. Connectivity options include NFC and Bluetooth 4.2. The Huawei nova 2S packs a 3340 mAh battery on board with Huawei SuperCharge that fills the battery from 0 to 50 percent in just 30 minutes.. As for the pricing and availability, the newly-unveiled device costs CNY 2,699 (around PHP 20,500) for the 4GB/64GB variant, CNY 2,999 (around PHP 23,000) for the 6GB/64GB model and CNY 3,499 (around PHP 26,600) for the beefed-up version with 6GB/128GB storage combo. It is available in five color variants: Black, Gray, Red, Blue, and Rose Gold.. Pre-orders for the Huawei nova 2S have already started from December 7 while shipments start from December 12. Sadly, there's no word yet about an international release, but knowing that we got the nova 2i officially in the country, chances are high that we'd get the latest nova 2S as well..

The Huawei Nova 2S looks sharp in leaked pictures. by Williams Pelegrin December 4, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. When Huawei announced the Nova 2 and Nova 2 Plus in May, I didn’t think we would be talking about a sequel before the year was done. Well, it’s December, and that’s exactly what we’re doing, thanks to some leaked pictures and a press invite.. The leaked images you see below, spotted by GSMArena , show off the Nova 2S, which looks to be the mid-cycle upgrade to the Nova 2. If the images are to be believed, the Nova 2S will come in three colors: black, white, and blue. There is also talk of the phone coming in red and pink, giving folks a unique array of color options to pick from if they opt for the Nova 2S.. The leak doesn’t give away the phone’s specifications, but according to rumors, the Nova 2S will feature a 6-inch 18:9 Full HD display, with last year’s octa-core Kirin 960 chipset paired with 6 GB of RAM under the hood. Reportedly, the phone will feature dual 20 MP cameras on the front, as well as a 20 MP and 16 MP combo on the back. Finally, the Nova 2S might run Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box, with Huawei’s EMUI 8.0 layered on top.. As for availability, a recently-obtained press invite by XDA Developers states that Huawei will launch the Nova 2S on Thursday, December 7 in Beijing, China. If true, then Huawei will have a very busy week, seeing how the company is slated to hold a global launch event for the Honor V10 and Honor 7X on December 5. We should learn plenty more by week’s end on all three phones, such as pricing and availability, so stay tuned as we bring you additional information.. In the meantime, let us know in the comments if you are looking forward to the Nova 2S, Honor V10, or Honor 7X.. Please enter a valid email address. Android Authority APP Get it on.

Huawei Nova 2S revealed with a 2:1 display and Android Oreo in-tow. 6-inch FHD Display (2160 x 1080). Last week, Huawei began sending press invitations for an event where the new Huawei Nova 2S was set to be unveiled, and now the company has followed through. The Huawei Nova 2S is officially here, and offers yet another beautiful design as the device follows up the Huawei Nova 2 , which launched back in May.. The changes between the Nova 2S and its predecessor are noticeable right off the bat as the Nova 2S is the latest offering to sport an aspect ratio of 18:9 with its new 6-inch FHD display. Powering the Nova 2S is Huawei’s Kirin 960 chipset, which was at the helm of Huawei’s flagship devices from 2016. This has been paired with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of storage.. Sandwiched between the frame and the display, Huawei has moved the fingerprint scanner from the rear to the front, which will also double as a home button for those who like an “old-school” feel. Also included on the front of the device, we have two cameras with a primary 20MP and a secondary 2MP sensor which will presumably help you create awesome selfies with Portrait mode. The front cameras also support Face Unlock, which was recently introduced by Huawei and has been included with the recently-launched Honor V10 .. Moving to the rear of the Nova 2S, Huawei has included another dual camera system, with a primary 16MP RGB sensor, and a secondary 20MP monochrome sensor. This isn’t the first device that we’ve seen released with both an RGB and Monochrome sensor, but Huawei has a good track record with camera quality, so hopefully the same rings true with the Nova 2S.. If you were worried about Huawei moving backward and using microUSB, don’t fret. USB Type-C will provide all of your charging needs for the included 3,340mAh battery. Plus, Huawei SuperCharge is onboard which Huawei is claiming will recharge your device up to 50% in just 30 minutes.. Finally, the Nova 2S will be available in Black, Grey, Red, Blue, and Rose Gold color options. Pricing will start at ~$407 for the base 4GB/64GB model, goes up to ~$453 for the 6GB/64GB model, and a hefty ~$528 for the top-end 6GB/128GB variant.. As with most of these devices, there has yet to be any mention of a US launch for the Huawei Nova 2S, but considering the fact that Huawei is looking to continue to break into the US market, I wouldn’t be surprised to see an announcement at CES 2018 ..

Huawei Nova 2s starts at $407 in China with four cameras and thin screen borders. Adrian Diaconescu December 7, 2017 8:20 am. Less than 24 hours after we rounded up the latest, juiciest rumors and leaked renders of the unreleased Nova 2s , Huawei decided to make its umpteenth 2:1 smartphone officially official.. This one basically squeezes between the Honor 7X and Mate 10 duo on the Android totem pole, both in terms of specifications and price points. Relatively eye-catching and premium-built, the Huawei Nova 2s finds enough space under its Full HD+ screen to accommodate a front-facing fingerprint reader.. But the bezels are certainly not chunky, and the extra-large 6-inch IPS LCD panel fits into a chassis that’s only slightly taller and wider than the body of the 5.5-inch Nova 2 plus. Aside from a trend-following 2160 x 1080 display resolution and 18:9 aspect ratio, the Nova 2s also has a quad-camera setup going for it.. There are two 20MP monochrome and 16MP RGB imaging sensors mounted on the 6-incher’s back, as well as 20 and 2MP selfie shooters. Under the hood, a slowly aging high-end Kirin 960 processor guarantees solid mid-range performance for a good couple of years down the line, while an Android 8.0 Oreo-based EMUI 8.0 OS runs the software show out the box.. Up for grabs already in China only, the Huawei Nova 2s fetches 2,699 yuan ($407) with 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage, or CNY 2,999 ($453) in a 6GB RAM/64GB ROM configuration.. Both versions are available in red, black, gray, rose gold and blue, with 3340mAh battery capacity, USB Type-C, NFC, a 3.5mm headphone jack and Hi-Fi audio wrapping up a decidedly robust list of features..

Later, he realized this was pretty much his only marketable skill, so he first created a personal blog (in Romanian) and then discovered his true calling, which is writing about all things tech (in English)..

Huawei announces the Nova 2s: Up to 6GB RAM, four cameras, aggressive pricing. by Peter Kostadinov. Tags :. Android - Android + Huawei - Huawei +. Huawei is on an announcement spree lately, having announced the Mate 10 and the Mate 10 Pro merely a month or so ago, and also having its subsidiary - honor - announce the US-bound honor View 10 merely two days ago. Yet, the major smartphone maker is seemingly not done yet with new device releases - enter the brand new Huawei Nova 2s.. The successor to last year's not-at-all-that-shabby Huawei Nova is jumping straight into the bezel-less game by boasting a tall, 18:9 display with slim bezels on the sides that's pretty up-to-date with the latest fads. Said display is an LCD one that clocks in at 6" and has a resolution of 1080 by 2160 pixels. Interestingly, unlike the vast majority of bezel-busting devices with tall displays, the Nova 2s does have a physical home button at the front, similar to the Mate 10. It's a rather narrow button, but nevertheless, it's up there at the front catering to everyone that's not yet ready to fully embrace software navigation buttons. The fingerprint scanner is embedded in the button, so no rear-positioned sensors of the type.. Ticking under the metal body of the phone is an octa-core Kirin 960 chipset which might not be a high-end endeavor like the Kirin 970, but will still. There will be 4 and 6GB versions of the device, but the realy great aspect of it all is that 128GB of native storage and a microSD card slot are the standard on all versions.. Just like it's trendy these days, the Nova 2s comes with a dual-camera system comprising of an f/1.8, 16 and 20MP snapper, but none of these is a telephoto zoom - the 16MP camera is a regular RGB one whereas the 20MP one is a monochrome camera for improved low-light performance. Up front, you will find two cameras as well - an f/2.0, 20MP one and curiously a 2MP sidekick.. A fast-chargable 3,340mAh battery keeps the lights on, while Android 8.0 Oreo with EMUI runs the show.. Oh, and there's also a 3.5mm headphone jack up there, a pleasant surprise!. The Huawei Nova 2s will be available in. Black, Gray, Red, Rose Gold and Blue, with prices starting at. 2,699 Yuan ($408) for the 4GB/128GB version and 2,999 Yuan ($453) for the 6GB/128GB version.
