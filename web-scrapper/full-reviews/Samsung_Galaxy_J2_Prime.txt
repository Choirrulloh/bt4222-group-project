Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime Reviews. The Galaxy J2 Prime carries 8GB internal storage and 1.5 of RAM, Removable Li-Ion 2600 mAh battery, 5 inch (540x960) display with LTE network connection.. 5.0 inches, 540 x 960 pixels. 2G, 3G, 4G (LTE), 8GB, 1.5GB ... Please feel free to post your review on this product.. 3 for design similar to 2015 Galaxy J3 and its old design but then its fine. 4 for portability no quick charge feature but charging is fine and u can use the USB on PC. 4 for operability if your a samsung fan u know whats the feature of every new samsung style every year sadly its on 6.0 marshmallow means u cant transfer or use your sd card as internal easilly "lollipop is better". 2 for response 100% not for gaming and 100% not for online games even u watching youtube and streams u can encounter a ton of bugs and lags thats why i dont prefer this phone even it has 1.5GB RAM. 4 for display as i said its similar to 2015 J3 it has the old Home Button on the downside no finger print sensor so its just fine not special. 4 for listenability the sound is ok not quite clear to hear but it has sound and its fine. 3 for battery only 2,600mAh but its ok for the price. Screen never response properly too sensitive when your hand is so sweaty .... Memory : I really dont mind the 8gb memory but the phone already uses up 4gb out of the box with it's system and other bloatware, icing on the cake would be the non expandable memory; not all apps can be moved to the sd card, so if you use lots of apps on your previous device then you're out of luck on this one.. Multitouch : I know the phone can only support up to two but not at a hundred percent of the time, some applications that require this, rhythm games for example, might have issues with this.. Price : Is it bang for the buck? No, i feel like there are other phones out there, which are priced lower but still perfoms similar if not better than this device.. 7/10 it's okay but would not recommend.. Good morning everyone got this new phone from samsung this Galaxy J2 Prime is the best because it has 8GB internal storage and 1.5 of RAM, Removable Li-Ion 2600 mAh battery, 5 inch (540x960) display with LTE network connection. we all know that the durability to this one is so amazing good job samsung!.

User Reviews for Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime. 4 / 5 ( 46 ). this phone is much better than other chinese phones. i bought this phone for my mother so wanted a reputed rand only. my friends suggested me to go other phones of micromax, intex, lava, coolpad, LEEco brand and much more having higher and better features and specifications. J2 prime comes with the credibility and customer service of such a popular brand. that is why i like this phone. samsung J2 prime has bright display. i have still yet to buy a micro SIM card. price also fitted my budget and in the end, my dear mother is very very happy.. Samsung J2 prime is an underrated phone indeed. i was initially quite skeptical of buying this phone as i had a little negative feedback about this device. that storage space is low, Ram is less hence decreasing the processing speed. but i just needed to upgrade my phone. i require it for simple purposes like making calls, sending text messages, clicking pictures, using GPS, listening to music and browsing internet for sometime. u definitely have microSD card slot to add on more storage. ordered my phone last week and got the delivery yesterday. i am still to explore all the features of thiis phone and will keep u all updated.. samsung J2 prime has 8GB internal storage memory which is quite less and gets clogged by loading only few apps. SD card can be added to ncrease the storgae space but more apps cannot be loaded on them it can only be used to add more videos, music and audio and data files.. Samsung J2 prime is the Great branded phone by Samsung for the money spent. Bright and sharp display, Android 6.0 operating system, delivers good picture quality, good battery life. Only drawback is that I can think of is that it does not support Wi fi 802.11 which is a very basic thing.. samsung J2 prime is a great phone.. my 6 year old son just loved it.. good camera performance and clicks wonderful pictures.. samsung has recently added two latest phones to its budget J series- ie, Samsung J2 ace and samsung J2 prime. both of them have almost same features and specs .. similar 2650 mAH battery, same 8 megapixel rear camera and 5 megapixel front camera, 1.5gb RAM, 8GB inbuilt memory out of which only 3.5 gb is avialble to the user for storing apps.which one to prefer, dont know. i still feel j2 prime is better, has slightly bigger screen and battery backup.. samsung j2 prime is a good phone but you can opt for something better in same budget... it looks nice like normally alll samsung phonnes, have strong build quality. but there is some problem with its 4G connectivity. i have to switch off my wi-fi when i want to use my 4g network,. it does not automatically shift from wi-fi to LTE, have to retsart the phone again to the internet connectivity. also j2 prime does not have enough space to store all my favourite and useful apps. wish i cud get it exchanged or returned for something more worthwhile..dont know what to do. might give it to my younger brother as he does not have much inclination towards various apps.. the wifi is getting disconnected and then reconnecting many times. it has a smart switch which makes the transfer very easy and problem-free. if we disable the smart switch and then activate the wifi in standby mode, then there is no problem. i have also updated the software of the router but still the problem is not fully solved. any suggestions, what shall i try anything else?. all samsung phones have same problem of less internal storage memory 8GB.. how can this company expect to feature so less memory. u cannot even have more than 10-15 apps in the phone. there so many helpful apps these days.. the user would have remove old apps to make up space for new app which is very tiresome and time wasting... even important apps like facebook, youtube, google play store, whatsapp eat lot of the phone space.. shows the 'message full' warning all the time. next time, samsung people, please include at least 16Gb space. even i am not able to move the apps to external SD card.. please someone help and guide me. lot of expandable storage..i am using it as a media device as in 128GB i can store lot of photos, songs, videos , music and more. i am not sure whether u can transfer the apps to external card or not.. got some really cute and clear clicks with this phone. my 3 yr old son is just loving it. the phone is easy to opearte. he can also click from camera with it.. samsung j2 prime has lot of preloaded apps already installed in the phone, which uses lot of memory. Very less space left for user to store his data. Out of total 8GB internal memory, 4.5GB system memory can be edited or cleared by us. U canot even use more than two messenger apps on the phone. For new apps, i have to uninstall old app and then install new app again and again which is very tedious. I hav ealsready inserted SD card also. Can we install apps on the external card.. the battery of samsung j2 prime gets drained out very fast. If i am using 4G network and litening to music for an hour and a half, then the battery gets reduced to a half.. i have to recharge it again. The battery should be more in a 4G volte phone as it gets burn out very fast. They claim to be having a power saving mode but it is of not much use as i feel there is not much difference... the pros is that the camera quality is very good. Pictures come out really well even in evening in low light environment and dim light as well.. this phone samsung j2 prime is working out fine for me. Its memory can be expanded upto 256 GB which is quite huge. I am using this large memory capacity to use it as a media device to store full fledged movies, videos, music and lots and lots of pictures. Not much complaints except that the multitouch gets little weak at very rare times but the problem gets rectified within seconds.. My friend was coming from zimbabwe. I asked him to get Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime mobile for me as it was not available in india. I just got it a week back and have been using it since then. My son is absolutely loving this phone. He is playing games on it and also watching videos on youtube also. The picture quality is also good. It is very easy to use and he can also click very good selfies himself. Selfie camera with flash is an advantage as it gives good performance at night also. Are you sure you want to report it?. Share a link to this review.

The handset further offers dual SIM capabilities, 1.5 GB of RAM, 8 GB of expandable storage space, and a 2600 mAh battery.

Here’s a quick rundown between the two Samsung Prime smartphones that’ll help any potential buyer out there.. The Galaxy J2 Prime is a bit bigger and heavier than the Galaxy J3 Prime. The J3 Prime has a dimension of 141 x 70.1 x 8.6 mm and a weight of 148 g while the J2 Prime’s dimensions are 144.8 x 72.1 x 8.9 mm with a weight of 160 g. The two Galaxy Prime phones both have models with Single SIM slot and Dual SIM slot, both supporting 3G, 4G, and LTE connection.. Both Samsung Galaxy J3 Prime and Galaxy J2 Prime has a 5-inch screen display with multitouch capability. However, the J3 Prime has a higher resolution (720×1280) and pixel density (294 ppi) compared to the resolution (540×960) and pixel density (220 ppi) of J2 Prime.. The J2 Prime comes in four different colors namely Black, Gold, Silver, and Pink while only three colors are available for J3 Prime which are White, Gold, and Black.. Despite being the latest release, Samsung Galaxy J3 Prime loses points to the J2 Prime when it comes to the camera. While J3 Prime has a 5MP rear camera, the J2 Prime brags its 8MP f/2.2 rear camera. Both of the rear cameras have LED flash and autofocus features but the 3MP difference gives the J2 Prime the point for rear cameras. The J2 Prime also boasts its 5MP f/2.2 front camera and LED flash, leaving J3 Prime’s 2MP front camera in the dust.. However, the J3 Prime can shoot videos at a 1080p while the Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime can only take videos up to 720p. The camera features also sides with J3 Prime because even if both phones have features like geo-tagging, touch focus, and face detection, only J3 has the HDR and Panorama features.. Storage size is one of the most important factors that affects a buyer’s decision. With tons of apps and files being downloaded and uploaded, it wouldn’t be a surprise if half of the decision was influenced by the storage size of a phone.. The Galaxy J2 Prime has an 8GB internal storage with 1.5GB of RAM while a 16GB internal storage and 1.5GB of RAM is given to J3 Prime. However, these sizes can be extended up to 256 GB via microSD.. For the phone’s operating system, the Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime runs on Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) while the Galaxy J3 Prime runs on Android 7.0 (Nougat). Both phones’ CPU are powered by quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53. For their chipset, the J2 Prime has a Mediatek MT6737T while the J3 Prime has Exynos 7570 Quad.. When it comes to connectivity, both phones uses the same technology for their GPS, WiFi and Bluetooth connection. They also have the same USB port.. All of these specs would be useless if the phone is not powered by a worthy battery. Fortunately for the two phones, they are both using a removable Li-Ion 2600 mAh battery.. Of course, we’re not just after the hardware and software here. We also have to consider the pricing of the two models. The Samsung Galaxy J3 Prime is not yet available in the Philippines, but its price in the US of $150 translates to around ~ Php7,500 here. On the other hand, the Galaxy J2 Prime is priced at Php5,990 .. Both Galaxy J2 Prime and Galaxy J3 Prime are great phones, they almost have the same power and capabilities but they also have their own weaknesses and disadvantages. However, most of the strengths can be found on J2 Prime’s built. The power of the phone’s processor and camera are enough for it to be picked as the winner over J3 Prime..
