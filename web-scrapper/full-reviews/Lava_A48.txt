By sulekha chandra | 14 Jul 2016. Yesterday, my friend told me about Lava A48 which is available in just 2,899 INR and I have decided to gift it to my mother as this will be a good option to learn how to operate a smartphone. The 4-inch display of the phone would be perfect for her at least in the begining as she would be able to watch movies and read properly. I only wish its battery of 1300 mAh to be much better..

Lava is on the path to success! I don’t know about everyone else, but I personally think that Lava A48 is a good budget phone. Not only is it extremely pocket friendly, but it also has all the necessary features one would require a smartphone to have. Not to go into technicalities, the specs are good and will give you a smooth browsing experience. Camera is good too, especially for this price range. And I am just happy that someone is finally listening to us poor souls and sending a screen guard as a part of the ‘ In the Box’ items! It is always a hassle to find those, and now they’re a part of the phone accessories only. 17 Aug 2016 By Flipkart Customer On flipkart.com.

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 4 GB + MicroSD. Release date: unknown. Too little RAM memory (0.5 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (233 ppi). Does not support fast data speeds (UMTS). The LAVA A48 is a basic smartphone with Android 5.1. Its specs are nothing to write home about - 4" 480 x 800 px display, 1.3 GHz quad core processor, coupled with 512 MB RAM, and 2 MP rear camera, along with 0.3 MP front one. Dual SIM card support is on board as well.. Dimensions: 4.95 x 2.52 x 0.39 inches (125.8 x 64 x 9.9 mm). Weight: 4.11 oz (116 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 480 x 800 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..
