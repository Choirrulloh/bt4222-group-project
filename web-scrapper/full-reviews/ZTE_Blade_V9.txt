ZTE's midrange phone line, the Blade series, wasn't that memorable when CNET reviewed the Blade V8 Pro last year. But it did offer a low price and good battery life.. The newest Blade V9 and Blade V9 Vita, announced in Barcelona at Mobile World Congress, may not blow you away either. But the overall feel and specs are better, and the Blade V9 now has a 5.7-inch 18:9 display that comes closer to what premium phones offer in size-to-screen ratio. They'll be released in Europe, Latin America and Asian markets, but not in the US. Instead, expect ZTE to release some sort of carrier-based variants to these phones later in the year.. ZTE's low-priced midrange Blade V9 phone could hint at.... We looked at both the Blade V9 and V9 Vita in a brief hands-on opportunity.

The Blade V9 edges out the V9 Vita in specs. Key stats include a Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 octa-core 1.8 GHz processor, Android Oreo 8.1, 32 or 64GB of storage, and a dual rear 16-megapixel camera that's supposed to be better at taking lower-light shots.. Keep in mind that the Blade V9's second rear camera is only 5-megapixels, though: It's used to collect some picture data and also help with AR applications and depth sensing. The Blade V9 starts at €269 (equivalent to £235, $330 US, or AU$420).. The Blade V9 Vita: more compact.. The smaller Blade V9 Vita has a 5.45-inch 18:9 display, a Snapdragon 435 processor, and a 13-megapixel/2-megapixel dual rear camera and less onboard storage (16 or 32GB), starting at €179 (equivalent to £160, $220 US, or AU$280).. Depending on how affordable these can get, they could end up being good budget phone picks. But the right price might be everything.. By the way, ZTE promises that these phones will run AR apps, but they are not compatible with Google's ARCore apps. Instead, I tried a few AR tricks on the included camera app, including a pop-up T-Rex which didn't stay put very smoothly on a table. If you're actually interested in augmented reality, I'd hold out for an ARCore phone instead.. ZTE Blade V9 and Blade V9 Vita go big-screen. MWC 2017: Where are they now?.

Mid-range ZTE Blade V9 and low-end Tempo Go are officially unveiled at MWC 2018. Adrian Diaconescu February 25, 2018 10:00 am. Pocketnow’s MWC coverage is made possible by InvisibleShield, which frees you to go everywhere with your mobile device without the fear of damaging your screen. To live fearlessly with your mobile device, visit. As expected , ZTE has a couple of new phones to showcase at MWC 2018, and also as expected, the already long overdue Axon 9 is not one of them.. Powered by a Snapdragon 450 processor, the Blade V9 is obviously no Samsung Galaxy S9 challenger. But you’re looking at plenty of choice from this mid-range 5.7-incher in both the memory and storage department, which is always nice.. Regardless of your favorite RAM/ROM configuration, be it 4 + 64GB, 3 + 32GB or 2 + 16GB, the ZTE Blade V9 has one of those stylish “full screen” designs going for it, as well as an expanded 18:9 aspect ratio and respectable FHD+ resolution.. For a budget-friendly Android Oreo device, this sure boasts an eye-catching backplate design and pretty impressive dual camera setup focused on capturing clear nighttime photographs. You can choose between a 13 or 8MP single selfie shooter, with those rear-facing imaging sensors set at 16 and 5MP.. The “regular” Blade V9 will be accompanied in markets like Spain, Germany, Russia, Mexico and China by a slightly smaller, lower-end and significantly less flashy V9 Vita “cousin.” Both versions offer 3200mAh battery capacity, but the 5.45-inch Vita settles for an HD+ panel with thin bezels, 13 + 2MP dual rear cams, Snapdragon 435 SoC, and no way to upgrade the base 2 and 16GB memory and storage counts.. Stateside, you can already purchase a modest ZTE Tempo Go with Android Oreo (Go edition) software online in exchange for a measly $79.99. That doesn’t get you a lot of bang, or a particularly snazzy design, but this still has the honor of being the world’s first Android Go phone powered by a Qualcomm processor.. Namely, a Snapdragon 210, paired with 1GB RAM, 8GB internal storage, a 2200mAh battery and a 5-inch FWVGA screen, which sounds bad, but should work just fine thanks to Google’s.

ZTE at Mobile World Congress 2018 announced the launch of three new phones in its portfolio. These include the Blade V9 and Blade V9 Vita in its mid-range segment, and the company's first phone with Android Oreo (Go edition) - ZTE Tempo Go. Talking about the upgrades to the Blade series, both phones sport an 18:9 display and run the latest Android 8.1 Oreo out-of-the-box. Tempo Go, on the other hand, runs a custom version of Android Oreo that has been trimmed down and optimised for budget smartphones with lower specifications.Pricing and availabilityZTE Blade V9 specifications,ZTE Blade V9 Vita specifications,ZTE Tempo Go specifications,zte blade v9 vita,zte blade v9 price, zte blade v9 price in india,zte blade v9 pro,zte blade v9 mobile,zte blade v9 india, zte blade v9 mobile price,zte blade v9 gsmarena,zte blade v9 pro price, zte blade v9 specification,zte blade v9, zte blade v9 price in pakistan,zte blade v9 price in bd,zte blade v9 release date, zte blade v9 review,zte blade v9 specs, zte blade 2 v956,.

ZTE Blade V9 passes through FCC, set for an MWC launch?. by Williams Pelegrin 4 weeks ago. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. believed to be the ZTE Blade V9 has just passed through the Federal Communications Commission Â. It features the ID code “SRQ-ZTEBLADEV9″âwhich is a pretty big clue as to which phone we’re dealing withâa nd its listing confirms some previously leaked specs details.. The handset is coming with 2 GB RAM / 16 GB ROM and 3 GB RAM / 32 GB ROM memory versions, running Android 8.0 Oreo with the January security patches.. reveal of the V9 on the official ZTE website in December. That listing was quickly pulled, but with the promotional materials ready, and the device hitting the FCC, it looks like the V9 could be shaping up for an MWC 2018 launch. Find out more in the original coverage below.. It’s almost been a year since ZTE announced the Blade V8 , which lacked the Pro moniker but remained a solid option for those not wanting to break the bank. Fast forward to today, and someone at ZTE must have jumped the gun a bit, because the product page for the Blade V9 went up for a bit before being taken down.. Even with the page no longer available, TechAndroids was still able to get all the information about ZTE’s upcoming smartphone. That information starts with the Blade V9 being the company’s first phone to feature an 18:9 aspect display, which possibly brings the 5.7-inch display to a 2160 x 1080 resolution. There still appears to be a good amount of bezel above and below the display, so take that as you will.. Above the display sits a 13 MP selfie shooter, while a dual 16 MP and 5 MP camera system is found around back. Interestingly, only the 16 MP sensor is capable of autofocus — the 5 MP camera has a fixed-focus lens — so we assume that secondary camera is used for depth information than anything else.. Under the hood sit Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 450 chipset and either 2 GB, 3 GB, or 4 GB of RAM. We assume the amount of RAM corresponds with the amount of internal storage, since there are also three options to pick from: 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB. Regardless of the choice, the microSD card slot will net you additional storage, should you need it.. MicroUSB is what you’ll use to charge the phone, and all I can do about that is sigh. Ending on higher notes, the 3,200 mAh battery should be sufficient for all-day use, while Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box is always a good thing.. The question now becomes when the Blade V9 will be announced and for how much. My money is on an announcement during CES 2018 , seeing how the product page briefly went up, and given the specifications, don’t expect to pay more than $300. We’ll find out for sure once the annual meet-up gets rolling, so stay tuned as we deliver all the news from the ground floor at Las Vegas.. Please enter a valid email address.

ZTE debuts budget-friendly Blade V9, and its first Android Go-powered phone. Following the Blade V8 series , ZTE is offering the next-generation of devices within the Blade family — the Blade V9 and the Blade V9 Vita.. The Chinese company made the announcement on Sunday at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.. In addition to the Blade V9, ZTE also introduced its first Android Go smartphone, called the Tempo Go.. Here’s everything you need to know about the ZTE Blade V9 and Tempo Go.. The ZTE Blade V9 has a 5.7-inch Full HD+ display with an 18:9 aspect ratio, which provides a longer screen for viewing more content. The edges around the screen have been minimized for a more full-screen design, a trend every smartphone manufacturer is following.. The back of the phone is glass, giving it a more expensive feel. It’s slim, and despite its large size, it feels fairly compact. The back is incredibly minimal, with just the ZTE logo, a fingerprint sensor, and a dual-camera system.. There’s a 3.5mm headphone jack at the top, and sadly, ZTE opted for a MicroUSB charging port on the bottom. The company said since this phone is primarily meant for markets outside the U.S., there’s not much demand to see USB-Type C in an affordable smartphone.. Under the hood, the Blade V9 is powered by the Snapdragon 450 processor, which performed well in our brief hands-on time with the phone. Apps opened quickly, and moving throughout the operating system was fluid.. Perhaps what’s more impressive, however, is how the Blade V9 does not come installed with ZTE’s MiFavor user interface. No, it runs stock Android 8.1 Oreo. Why did ZTE dump its own software? Because its customers — specifically from the Z Community forum — preferred the bloatware-free, pure version of Android. It’s a big change, and ZTE told Digital Trends it will use stock Android in all its future smartphones, including those in its higher-tier Axon range.. There’s hardly any apps pre-installed on the phone, except for a few core Google apps. The user interface is simple, but it’s likely why it’s so fast to react.. The Blade V9 also packs a 3,100mAh battery, and comes in a variety of storage options. With the 2GB RAM model, you’ll get 16GB of storage; 3GB of RAM comes with 32GB; and 4GB offers 64GB. There’s a MicroSD slot for expandable storage of up to 256GB, as well.. Dual lens cameras aren’t new on ZTE phones, but we’re impressed at the speed and quality from the Blade V9’s camera. A 16-megapixel camera is accompanied with a 5-megapixel one, and the two are capable of taking portrait mode-like selfies. The camera results, in our brief tests, looked good, with solid color accuracy, no blur, and good detail. We’re excited to see how the camera reacts in all sorts of environments, especially because ZTE has improved its low-light image processing with the V9.. As for the front-facing camera, it comes in at 8-megapixels, but 13-megapixels interpolated. pixels are added to the image by estimating the new color and intensity. So, even though you’re taking a photo with an 8-megapixel camera, the camera’s software will make it look as though it was taken with 13-megapixels instead. This may not necessarily mean the photo will look better since it’s essentially simulating the higher-resolution.. The ZTE Blade V9 will be available in Spain, Germany, Russia, and Mexico. The Blade Vita is a similar device with slightly different specifications, and it will launch in China with the company’s MiFavor UI instead of stock Android.. As for color options, the Blade V9 comes in four different variants — black, gold, blue, and grey. We likely won’t see the V9 here in the U.S., but ZTE usually works with smaller carriers like MetroPCS and Boost Mobile to bring different versions of the Blade V-series phones. Expect the same for the V9.. The Tempo Go is an even more budget smartphone with a simple design. It includes a 5-inch display, and comes in at 854 x 480 pixels. At the bottom, you’ll find both a 3.5mm headphone jack and a MicroUSB charging port.. What’s unique about this device is that it runs Google’s new Android Go platform, which is a much smaller size version of Android meant for lower-end phones. It’s capable of running on phones with just 512MB of RAM. Android Go comes with lightweight Google apps that are smaller than 10MB in size, like Gmail Go .. The Tempo Go is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 210 chipset, with a battery capacity of 2,200mAh. The phone comes with 8GB of storage, which is expandable to 32GB thanks to a MicroSD card slot, and it only has 1GB of RAM. On the back, there’s a 5-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 2-megapixel front-facing camera.. The phone has a custom version of the Google Play Store integrated, allowing users to download either the lite or full version of apps, depending on their preference. Android Go also includes Google Assistant Go, allowing users to interact with Google’s artificially-intelligent assistant.. The Tempo Go will be sold unlocked on GSM, UMTS, and LTE networks in the U.S. It’ll cost you $80, and will be available for purchase on ZTE’s site. As far as color variants, the Tempo Go only comes in the grey model.. ‘Smart’ sunglasses from Vuzix work with Android and iOS, will debut at CES.

ZTE Blade V9 with 18:9 display, Android Oreo spotted online. ZTE is expected to unveil the Blade V9 smartphone at the upcoming CES 2018.. Published: Thursday, December 28, 2017, 11:22 [IST]. 2017 has been an uneventful year for ZTE given the company has only launched a handful of smartphones. However, it seems like, the Chinese OEM has some big plans for 2018.. We say so as a new ZTE branded smartphone has appeared on the company's Spanish website. Dubbed as the Blade V9, it is the first ZTE phone to feature a display with the aspect ratio of 18:9. Talking about the design, the smartphone sports a double sided glass design. The glass on the rear panel appears to be reflective like HTC's U lineup of smartphones.. While the bezels around the display are narrow, the ZTE Blade V9 can't be called a bezel-less phone. Especially, the top and bottom bezels are pretty prominent. The device doesn't feature a physical home button at the front and the fingerprint sensor is placed at the back. Design-wise, the Blade V9 is quite an improvement over its predecessor Blade V8.. Coming to the specifications, the new ZTE phone is fitted with a 5.7-inch FHD+ In-Cell display with an aspect ratio of 18:9. Under the hood, the smartphone is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 processor just like the Xiaomi Redmi 5.. There are three memory variants of the ZTE Blade V9. The options are 2GB RAM with 16GB internal storage, 3GB RAM with 32GB internal storage and 4GB RAM with 64GB internal storage. The storage space on all the variants can be further expanded via a hybrid dual SIM slot.. On the optics front, the ZTE Blade V9 comes with dual rear cameras. The camera setup is comprised of a 16MP autofocus sensor with an f/1.8 aperture and a 6P lens, and a 5MP fixed focus sensor. The camera module is placed at the top left corner of the phone's rear panel and is accompanied by a LED flash. As for the selfie camera, the smartphone makes use of a 13MP camera.. The Blade V9 runs Android Oreo out of the box and it is equipped with a 3,200mAh battery. The handset measures 151.4×70.6×7.5 mm and it weighs 140g. The smartphone has two color variants; Black and Gold.. As of now, there is no information on the pricing and availability of the ZTE Blade V9. The company is expected to unveil the smartphone at the upcoming CES 2018.. Gizbot Stay updated with latest technology news & gadget reviews. zte | ZTE Blade V9 | smartphones | mobiles | news.

More opportunities for unique combination photos.. “To provide meaningful innovation that enables consumers to experience more of the world around them is the best part of my job, and it is what truly motivates me,” continued Cheng. “We hope as consumers experience and explore more with leading features such as the low-light camera, they will share those experiences with us.”.

The overall feel and specs are better, and the Blade V9 now has a 5.7-inch 18:9 display that comes closer to what premium phones offer in size-to-screen ratio. They'll be released in Europe, Latin America and Asian markets, but not in the US. Instead, expect ZTE to release some sort of carrier-based variants to these phones later in the States later this the year.. Joshua Goldman /.

How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. ZTE Blade V9 finally makes the jump to 18:9 screens. JC Torres - Dec 28, 2017. Almost every major, and some minor, OEM has some nearly bezel-less phone with an 18:9 screen, varying in resolution, size, and the amount of bezels around it. One hold out is ZTE, but that changes with the revelation of the new ZTE Blade V9. But while this phones does indeed make the transition to that new aspect ratio, it seems that ZTE might have shaved off other aspects of the device to keep costs down.. ZTE almost had bezel-less and 18:9 displays. The nubia Z17s was the closest, but it fell a few pixels short with its 2040×1080 resolution, giving it an unusual 17:9 aspect ratio. It was, however, a premium smartphone both outside and inside.. The ZTE Blade V9, in contrast, is a mid-range device with some admittedly high-end specs. It runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 processor, at least one of the most recent chips. That 5.7-inch 18:9 screen only goes Full HD+. The base configuration has only 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of storage. It also only has a micro USB port.. It might be a bit disappointing, but it isn’t a complete loss. Memory configurations include, at most, 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage. The dual cameras on the back combine a 16 megapixel PDAF sensor with a 5 megapixel fixed focus camera, with an f/1.8 lens. And the 3,200 mAh battery is pretty massive for its range.. The ZTE Blade V9 has so far only been spotted in the Spanish market. Given ZTE’s usual flair, it will eventually roll out to other countries as well. Topics Android Phones smartphone ZTE.
