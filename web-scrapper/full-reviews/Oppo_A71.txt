Pricing and Availability of OPPO A71. It’s almost the holiday season so smartphone brands are now filling-up their line-up to gear up for the occasion. Unsurprisingly, each and everyone of them wants to be your choice to give out as a Christmas gift in December.. OPPO has released a new low-end smartphone dubbed as the OPPO A71 — the company’s budget-friendly offering.. But for its Php8,999 price tag, is the A71 worth it? Would it be able to handle day-to-day tasks well? Would your loved ones appreciate it as a gift this coming Christmas? Let’s figure that out in our OPPO A71 review.. The new OPPO A71 feels just like any other OPPO smartphone out there, but only with some noticeable changes in the design. It has an all-metal, unibody build with curved corners and edges which makes it really comfortable in the hand. And with its sufficient 5.2-inch screen, the OPPO A71 feels really compact and easy to carry, without sacrificing too much on usability. The device is also very light.. However, it’s overall dimensions could have been smaller if its top and bottom bezels aren’t too thick.. It’s also a bit identical to the OPPO R11— minus the iPhone-like antenna bands and the home button/fingerprint scanner.. And speaking of the fingerprint scanner, the OPPO A71 doesn’t have one. This is an obvious compromise that the company took to keep the price down. Instead, what we get are three capacitive buttons that don’t have backlighting.. At the left side, we have the volume controls while the right houses the lock/power button below the SIM tray. The buttons aren’t the most tactile of all, but they are still satisfying to press. They are also positioned well so they are easy to reach. On the other hand, the SIM tray can sport two micro SIM cards and a microSD card slot that can hold up to 256GB of storage. We have the 3.5mm headphone jack on top, while at the bottom we have the microUSB port and the loudspeaker. The grills at the left side has the built-in microphone, while the other end houses the actual speaker drivers. The loudspeaker delivers decent performance with ample volume, and balanced sound. It does get a bit distorted at max volume, but it’sstill usable.. The OPPO A71 features a 5.2-inch screen with 1280 x 720 pixel resolution. The handset’s display is just at the right sweet spot, as it’s not too big nor too small.. The screen projects decent colors and contrast, pretty typical to most IPS displays. It’s also not overly saturated, with no noticeable software tricks.. The viewing angles are also decent. I’ve noticed some minor color shifting when rotating it at different angles, but nothing too alarming to get worried about.. Inside the OPPO A71 is a 1.5GHz MediaTek octa-core processor, with 3GB of RAM, and 16GB of expandable storage. That’s pretty much the standard configuration you’d get from a sub-Php9k smartphone nowadays.. Performance wise, the OPPO A71 was able to meet my expectations. The processor was able to handle game titles well. I was able to play NBA Live and Need. For Speed No Limits with no noticeable frame drops. The entire system gets warm over extended period oftime, nothing worth complaining about.. The 3GB RAM of OPPO A71 also handled multitasking really well. Opening an app was fast, and switching between them was a breeze. On the downside, the 16GB of internal storage only lets you use 9.20GB of it. In case you’re wondering where the spare GBs are, the other half is reserved for the system files.. But nonetheless, 9-gigs was still enough to store several games, apps, and my entire Spotify library. If you’re really a media junkie, you can throw in a microSD card up to 256GB.. The OPPO A71 comes with their new ColorOS 3.1 that’s based on Android 7.1 Nougat. This is a welcome, and long-overdue update from the outdated Android 6.0 Marshmallow found on the OPPO F3 and F3 Plus .. The new ColorOS 3.1 brings new features and aesthetic changes to the interface. A lot of native apps have new icons and minor tweaks in the Settings app.. For the most iOS-like move ever, the Control Panel is unsurprisingly moved at the bottom. This leaves the Notification’s tab alone at the top.. Personally, I find this more user-friendly. You can just easily swipe up to gain quick access to some commands. No need to reach all the way up.. Moreover, OPPO is also introducing their own “OPPO Share” feature. This is OPPO’s take on iOS’s AirDrop file-sharing service. It utilizes both WiFi and Bluetooth so it can receive files from every compatible device, not just from OPPO.. The ColorOS 3.1 also has a split-screen mode. However, it doesn’t support most apps just yet. You can have YouTube running on while typing a text message on the side. It works with most native and Google apps, but the support for popular apps like Facebook, Instagram, and more still needs working out.. The feature works by holding the Recent apps button while you’re on the first compatible app.. Finally, the last worth-noting feature of the OPPO A71 is the new scrolling screenshot. Basically, you can take a screenshot of a long page at once. It can be enabled by pressing and holding the Volume up + lock/power switch. For comparison, a standard screenshot can be done by holding the Volume down + lock/power switch.. Overall, I’m satisfied with the new ColorOS 3.1 on the OPPO A71. It looks clean, with no compromise in features. I just hope it would receive future software and security updates.. OPPO slightly departs from its “selfie-centric” roots for the A71. The truth of the matter is, OPPO’s A-series isn’t really meant for that. The entire OPPO F-line became really popular in the country that we often forget that OPPO smartphones aren’t just for selfie addicts.. With that in mind, don’t be surprised that the OPPO A71 only has a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. Meanwhile, the shooter at the back gets to enjoy a 13-megapixel sensor.. But despite the low-resolution, I was still able to take good selfies with this one. The details are soft, but at least the colors aren’t so dull. Taking pictures at low-light scenarios are also passable and can be aided by an on-screen flash.. Of course, the camera app also has Beauty mode. This lets you adjust the fairness of your skin that’s projected by the camera. The software also has a front-facing panorama, which lets you take extra pictures in both left and right to ensure everybody is in the photo. This is a substitute for the lack of a wide-angle feature.. The 13-megapixel primary camera can also take decent pictures.. Just like most smartphones, it can take impressive photos in well-lit scenarios and degrade in quality as the sun goes down or when there’s not much light around.. With that said, the images taken by the OPPO A71 has good colors and contrast. The dynamic range isn’t the best, but not the worst either.. The pictures were taken at low-light scenarios are still usable, but this is where you’d see its real weakness. Noise and grains are now more visible, the colors are losing its fidelity, and the dynamic range goes down the drain.. The rear camera also has this “2x zoom” shortcut button. But unlike the ones we saw on dual-camera equipped smartphones, this thing only enables digital zoom instead of an optical one. This translates to a closer subject, but with a huge sacrifice in quality.. Still, the OPPO A71’s camera prowess is still respectable. It’s relatively fast, with acceptable image quality for the price.. Thanks to its humble specs, the 3000mAh battery that’s powering the OPPO A71 delivered impressive performance.. During light to moderate usage, the device was able to last me for a whole day, with still 10% to 15% charge left before I go to bed at night.. On the other hand, the OPPO A71 lasted for around 10 hrs and 10 mins on PCMark’s battery test. For a quick reference, most devices only have an average score of 6hrs. This goes to show the A71’s battery prowess.. OPPO delivered a pretty interesting deal with the A71. The company’s offering for the budget market is thoughtful, but it might struggle to survive in this saturated market.. The OPPO A71 has a solid, compact, and slightly refreshing design — a factor that I really admired about this device. It also packs a decent processor, a revamped interface, and a good battery life.. For its Php8,990 price tag, the OPPO A71 can be easily outshined by the competition. Other brands are now offering smartphones with a 1080p screen, a fingerprint scanner, or even an extra large battery at the same price range.. But still, it’s not hard to recommend the OPPO A71. If you’re looking for a solid, compact, and a workhorse for your day-to-day tasks, then you might want to consider this one out.. The OPPO A71 retails for Php8,990 and it’s now available online and in all OPPO stores and third-party retailers nationwide. It’s also available for 0% interest installment plans via Home Credit. You can have it for as low as Php927 per month for 6 months, with 40% downpayment (until January 31, 2018)..

Please feel free to post your review on this product.. Okay sana ang mga features ng phone na ito. Pero hindi ito nag a-update ng kanilang Android version di tulad ng ibang company tulad ng Huawei, Xiaomi, at iba pang brands. Nagre-release lang sila ng bagong phone na may bagong update ng OS pero hindi nila ina-update ang mga lumang A71. Kung satisfied ka naman sa software nito, okay na rin ang phone na ito. Pero kung hindi, mas marami pang ibang brands na nagrerelease ng updates nila every year.. Bkit po yung internal memory ko po is 9gb lang dpt po 16gb po db dun s internal memory. Yung unang tingan ko dito ang linis talaga niya tingnan at ang ganda ng design kasi simple lang para siyang iphone talaga yung round ang style niya maganda sa kamay kaya maganda okay din naman ang response niya mas mabilis yung processor nito unlike sa dati kung phone at ang camera din naman maganda kaya for me isang phone na ganito ay kontento na talaga ako.. Great design phone with sleek specs. I thought super mahal ang phone na ito ng makita ko siya sa online hindi pala ganun ka mahal expected ko sa phone na ito na sa 15 thousand ang ganda kasi ng design attractive itong masyado and also ... OPPO Mobile Phones > F5 Youth.

Especially, for techies with mid range budget Oppo has introduced some interesting phones. Previously released Oppo A57 has been quite sucessful. Oppo A71 is offering a little lower price and specifications than A57. But it is not really that special as the previous one. There is no fingerprint, gorilla glass 4 or 16 MP front camera in this device like the A57. Rather, Oppo A71 is offering somewhat average features with some advantages. Among the advantages there are 3 GB RAM, OTG, Octa-core CPU, 4G and 13 MP phase detection autofocus back camera and relatively attractive design. 5 MP front camera, 5.2 inch HD display, 16 GB ROM etc. Overall, you may find a better device in this price range from other brands in terms of specifications. But Oppo is also a trustworthy brand with fine build quality which should be considered before finalizing your choice.. User Rating: 2.52 ( 45 votes).

PriceOye DOES NOT sells mobile phones! We only help you save money.. 5.83 x 2.91 x 0.30 in. IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen, 16M colors. The customary Oppo design returns. You might feel let down by its display. The cameras department offers good, but known sensors. A 5.2 inches 720p display produces good graphics. 13 megapixel primary sensor is better than it seems on paper. Superb processing power primarily because of the presence of 3GB RAM. Doesn’t really offers much for its price. A smartphone costing 20,000 rupees and missing out on a fingerprint scanner is un-acceptable. The selfie sensor should’ve packed a bigger punch. A journey that began with the A37 has now reached the A71 come September 2017. It wasn’t long before the Chinese manufacturer came into our country as a relatively unknown quantity but within no time, plazas everywhere in the local markets were filled with Oppo’s name. The A71 is its newest addition to its sleek set of smartphones with a launching price-tag of 20,000 rupees.. When it comes to the company’s design department, we’re really dying to see something new come up. That hasn’t been the case up till now as the A71 features quite a known design; that doesn’t necessarily means that the design is bad as we’re satisfied by its looks and aesthetics. A full metal unibody design is its promise while dimensions wise, a 7.6mm width and a fitness-freakish 137g weight should surely be your cup of tea. Dust and waterproofing are yet to feature on any Oppo device and with the A71, your wait looks set to continue.. When it comes to most smartphones nowadays, a common man in our country would prefer to have a 5.5 inches display. The A71 unfortunately falls a-tad short of that but its display is no slouch by any means; we’re talking a 5.2 inches IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 282ppi pixel density. Combining to produce a 720p resolution, we’re sure that its prowess is good enough for a display sized at 5.2 inches. Had it been a 5.5 inches display with the same resolution, we definitely would’ve had our doubts about its graphical prowess.. The caption well describes what the A71’s cameras department has to offer. We wouldn’t blame you if you were expecting to see some big sensors and feature laden sensors here as Oppo’s made a name for itself by doing exactly that.. The smartphone’s primary camera features something close to what we described above; a 13 megapixel sensor with an LED flash plus common camera features that include autofocus, geo-tagging, touch focus, HDR, panorama etc. The selfie sensor, at 5 megapixels, probably falls short of what most people expected and we won’t say otherwise. However, when it comes to its primary sensor, we’re pretty sure that it’ll do really well to cater for your everyday needs.. Considering the general trend of specifications offered by the A71, we were extremely happy to see the smartphone featuring an octa-core processor with 3GB of RAM. That’s quite good to power the built-in Android Nougat while 16GB of internal storage might just be enough for an average user. If you’re not one of those, do make use of an external card-slot.. Nothing much else to talk about as the smartphone disappointingly misses out on a fingerprint scanner while we do have a 3000 mAh non-removable battery juicing the device. Black and gold are the only colour schemes available with the smartphone.. Signup for our newsletter and get discount vouchers.
