Mobiles / Gionee Mobile Phones / Gionee A1 Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 10,537 Launch Date in India: 10 April, 2017 Compare. The Chinese handset maker, Gionee is famed for its slim and sleek handsets that are also powerhouse performers. So far, the brand has delivered some really good handsets in the price range of INR 15,000-20,000. However, now the handset maker is trying to step up its game and is entering the mid-range segment with its Gionee A1. This handset comes with decent specifications and powerful cameras, which would attract many buyers. Here is a brief overview of the handset for those who might be interested.. Powerful front camera : It is now a common knowledge that the front camera of the handset is no more used for their original purpose of video calling but for clicking selfies. Such is the hype of selfies that these days manufacturers are coming up with smartphones that have more powerful cameras on the front instead of back and Gionee A1 is one such smartphone. There is a 16 Megapixels snapper on the front panel of the handset whereas, only a 13 Megapixels camera on the rear.. 2.5D curved display with Corning Gorilla Glass : The front panel of this handset is dominated by a large 5.5-inch display, which is brilliant to look at because of the 1920 x 1080 pixels resolution. What makes the display even better is the 2.5D curved glass, which comes with Corning Gorilla Glass protection.. Impressive battery : The flagship devices are usually skimpy on battery front since they tend to be quite sleek and there is not much space for a bigger battery. However, that is not the case with Gionee A1. This handset comes with a massive 4010 mAh battery, which is sure to last a day on full charge and more if used moderately.. Rear camera could have been better : While it is understandeable that it is a selfie smartphone and thus the front camera is much better than the rear. However, we personally feel that the rear camera should atleast match the one on the front.. 11,599 .00. Black +1 Variants. 12,150 .00.

Gionee A1 Specifications, Review and Price in India. The A1 is a selfie-centric smartphone brought about Chinese smartphone making Gionee, and has been outed recently to cater to the offline segment of the market. A 2.5D glass protects the phone's 5.5-inch Full HD AMOLED display from bumps, scratches and any physical ill-will that may take place. The phone is made up entirely of metal and is powered by a 2.0Ghz MediaTek Helio P10 octa-core chipset, supported by a 4GB RAM. The A1 comes out toting a 64GB inbuilt storage space, which you can stretch further till a maximum of 128GB via external sources. The OS being used in here is the very latest ANdroid 7.0 Nougat garnished with the company's native Amigo UI (version 4.0) on the top. For optics, the phone has a 13MP camera on the back (with dual-tone flash and PDAF) as well as a 16MP selfie snapper that comes with dedicated flash. The A1 has a fingerprint sensor hidden in its home button and packs in a 4,010mAh battery, that comes with 'Ultra fast charging' capabilities, to keep things afloat.

Gionee is one of the most consistent brands in the offline smartphone industry for several years. The company recently unveiled two new smartphones at MWC 2017—Gionee A1 and Gionee A1 Plus. A1 smartphone in India in less than a month’s time. The smartphone costs Rs 19,000 and focuses on selfies and battery with a 16MP selfie camera and a 4010mAh battery. Gionee A1 is one of those smartphones which do not carry anything striking in the design but still manage to look and feel good in hand. The device is slightly bigger and bulkier due to the extra amount of juice it carries inside.The smartphone has slight curves on the edges to feel better in hands and the design helps it to fit in hands despite of slightly slippery texture..

Ketan Pratap , 07 April 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Gionee A1 has been priced at Rs. It has a 16-megpixel front camera and a 4010mAh battery. Gadgets 360 rates the Gionee A1 7 out of 10. Gionee A1 design Gionee A1 specifications and software Gionee A1 cameras Gionee A1 performance. Gionee is one of the Chinese smartphone manufacturers that has focused more on its offline presence than online retail in India. At a recent launch event, the company boasted about how it has grown through offline channels over the years while other brands are fighting it out on e-commerce platforms. One factor that has worked well for Gionee so far is the fact that its product portfolio is spread across several price segments. Interestingly, Gionee has been tapping selfie-obsessed users across these segments, and the latest addition in the company's lineup is another attempt to do just that.. Gionee announced its new A-series smartphones , the A1 and A1 Plus , at the MWC 2017 trade show last month. Without much delay, the Gionee A1 has now been launched in India. The smartphone offers features like a 16-megapixel front camera and a huge battery, and it runs Amigo OS based on Android 7.0 Nougat. However, it is priced to fit into in a category where there are several other smartphones with similar capabilities.. Does the Gionee A1 offer the kind of experience that will beat its competition? We find out.. Metal bodies are slowly becoming a standard feature for the majority of smartphones being sold right now in India, even in the budget segment, and that's a good thing. Metal offers durability while also feeling premium. The Gionee A1 uses A6000 aircraft-grade material that the company claims is used in making premium cars and planes. The device's rounded sides and back also add to its visual appeal. The phone definitely feels sturdy, and the polished back is quite good-looking. The front is dominated by glass which comes right up to the corners of the phone and meets the curve of the metal rim. It fit very well in our hands.. There is a fingerprint scanner embedded in the home button, with capacitive Back and Recents buttons on either side of it. The volume and power buttons are on the right. Gionee has given the power button a reddish tone which is a unique touch. The front camera is placed right above the screen, and there's also an LED flash which Gionee calls "Selfie flash". The Micro-USB charging port and speaker are on the bottom, while the 3.5mm audio jack is on top.. The rear of the Gionee A1 looks familiar, with many current smartphones following the same design. We have antenna lines running across the top and bottom, like we've seen on many other phones such as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 ( Review ), which is priced lower than the Gionee A1. The camera protrudes slightly, but it isn't as noticeable as it is on the Moto G5 Plus ( Review ). There is a dual-LED flash right below the primary camera, with Gionee's logo below it for a symmetrical look. The logo is embossed in a circle, and it feels like the natural placement for a fingerprint reader. We kept trying to place our finger on the logo at the back at first, because we're so used to this positioning now. The Gionee name is printed at the bottom of the back panel as well.. At 183 grams, the Gionee A1 feels slightly heavy for a phone with this screen size. The Redmi Note 4, which also has an all-metal body and a 4100mAh battery, weighs just 165 grams in comparison. The Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime (167 grams) and Moto M (163 grams) also both belong in this category and weigh less than the Gionee A1.. The Gionee A1 ships with a charger, a Micro-USB cable, earphones, a transparent back cover, an instruction manual, and a SIM eject tool. Overall, we like its design and feel that it lives up to the price bracket in which it has been launched. We just wish that it was slightly lighter for more comfortable usage.. The Gionee A1 is powered by an octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 (MT6755) processor clocked at 2GHz, coupled with 4GB of RAM. It has 64GB of storage and supports microSD cards of up to 256GB. This is a hybrid dual-SIM phone, and 4G is supported on both SIMs, but only one at a time. You also get VoLTE (voice over LTE), Wi-Fi n, Bluetooth 4.0, and USB-OTG.. The handset is backed by a 4010mAh battery which the company claims can last for up to two days with mixed usage. The Gionee A1 supports fast charging which is a nice feature to have.. The Gionee A1 has a 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) display, and in our opinion it is one of the best we have seen in this price range. It is bright enough, and sunlight legibility is also decent. Blacks are rich, and colours are reproduced well. Viewing angles were also not a problem while watching videos. However, the front of this phone is a fingerprint magnet, and we had to wipe the screen from time to time during the review period.. The handset runs Amigo 4.0 OS based on Android 7.0 Nougat, and is among few handsets in its price segment that offers the latest version of Android out-of-the-box. Gionee's in-house Amigo OS has received much-required visual updates, and integrates a lot of Nougat features as well. Users will get the ability to run different apps in split-screen mode. The Settings app has also received a refresh, although there is no menu button in the upper left corner which lets users quickly switch between subsections without the need to go back to the main Settings screen.. Gionee has added few features like Smart Gestures that let you do things like answers calls automatically when you pick the phone up, or pause alarms when you flip it over. Smart vibration reminders can notify you about missed calls and messages while the phone is in standby, and a double-tap can wake the phone so you don't have to reach for the power button. There's an Edge Bar feature that offers shortcuts to your favourite apps when you swipe left or right on the home button. The A1 also lets you operate the screen while wearing gloves in winter.. As seen in previous version of Amigo OS, there is lots of preinstalled bloatware from Gionee which is mostly of no use, but there's no way to get rid of them. Gionee needs to make these apps optional for users. The Theme Park and Mood Wallpaper apps offer options for changing the look of the UI. There is a G Store app which offers new apps, games and videos. You also get preloaded third-party apps including Amazon, Xender, Hotoday, Messenger, Saavn, SwiftKey Keyboard, and Truecaller plus Asphalt Nitro, Bubble Bash 3, Danger Dash, and Real Football.. The Gionee A1 is being heavily marketed as a selfie phone, so we begin with that. There's a 16-megapixel front camera with autofocus and a single LED flash. The camera app offers live filters as well as smoothening, whitening, slimming, and eye enlarging features so you can "beautify" shots before they are taken. The software tweaks were fun to use. Most of our selfies were decent, though we noticed a little unnecessary colour tone which seemed artificial. HDR selfies tended to be better than regular ones. Low-light results were also good, though the front camera tended to pick up noise when light was limited. The selfie flash feature works as claimed by the company, and fills light in shots where there isn't enough. However, the flash can be uncomfortable when it goes off at arm's length from your eyes.. The 13-megapixel rear camera on the Gionee A1 has a dual-LED flash and f2.0 aperture. It uses a Sony IMX258 sensor. The camera app offers plenty of modes to choose from including night, professional, time-lapse, slow-motion, smart scene, and GIF. The Gionee A1's camera app also offers a translation feature that lets you photograph words or even few lines and translate them to another language. Only a few languages are supported, and the default is English to Simplified Chinese. The rear camera can record 1080p and 720p videos, and the quality was decent.. Tap to see full-sized Gionee A1 camera samples. The rear camera managed to take shots with accurate colours, but they tended to look oversaturated and lose texture quality at times. The camera also took some time to lock focus which can be annoying. Shots taken at night were also good, though we noticed some noise and motion blur on checking them at full size. Overall, the Gionee A1 offers decent cameras both in front and at the back, though we feel it needs further polish since photography is one of its main highlights.. The Gionee A1 definitely won't disappoint you in terms of performance, and the octa-core processor feels adequate for most jobs. The handset packs 4GB of RAM, and during our review, we found that there was around 1.8GB of RAM free at any moment. The fingerprint scanner on the Gionee A1 is really quick and we like the fact that the phone can be unlocked with just a touch, without us needing to press the home button.. Games like Asphalt 8: Airborne and Dead Effect 2 ran without frame rate drops, and we could flip between games and other apps without any lag. The 5.5-inch screen is good for movies and videos, and we had a good time streaming shows on our test unit.. We were however disappointed that the Gionee A1 got hot quite often. After just 30 minutes of gaming, it was uncomfortable to hold. This also happened when we used GPS for navigation and when using the camera app or even talking on the phone for a long time. Our unit even restarted itself a few times after getting warm, which isn't something we expect from a phone no matter its price. This issue ruined the overall usage experience for us.. The Gionee A1 offers MaxxAudio enhancement that claims to improve sound from the speaker as well as earphones. At higher volumes, the Gionee A1 doesn't disappoint, and clarity doesn't suffer. The bundled earphones are decent as well. Call quality was decent, and we didn't have any trouble with voice quality. We were impressed with the smartphone's ability to latch on to network in areas with low connectivity or weak Wi-Fi signals.. In our benchmark tests, the Gionee A1 fared well. It returned 50,186 on AnTuTu; 22,416 in Quadrant overall; 17fps in GFXbench; and 6,841 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme. At this price point, we have seen smartphones getting better scores than the Gionee A1.. The Gionee A1 doesn't disappoint when it comes to battery performance especially considering that this is the phone's other big highlight. The handset packs a non-removable 4010mAh battery and supports fast charging, which came in handy. Twenty minutes gave us a decent 40 percent charge, and the phone reached 100 percent in less than two hours. We logged an impressive 14 hours and 45 minutes of runtime in our HD video loop test. We also liked the regular and extreme power saving modes on the Gionee A1 which extended usage time for several hours. In real world usage, we found that the device easily managed over 36 hours with heavy usage where we had our email, Twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook, Instagram and more apps open in the background at all times. With light to medium usage, we got an impressive 45-48 hours of life with around 20 percent still remaining.. Verdict The Gionee A1 is a solid option in its price segment, and will definitely make heads turn with its good looks. Battery performance is impressive, and the cameras fare well enough. The heating issue however is this phone's biggest problem, and buyers will have to deal with the rear constantly getting warm with even day-to-day usage, which will get uncomfortable. The fact that this phone runs Android 7.0 Nougat gets extra points from us, though the software bloat is disappointing.. The Gionee A1 will be going on sale through offline retail channels as well as on Amazon India at a later date. The company is kicking off preorders for the Gionee A1 starting on March 31, and in a bid to woo customers, is offering a two-year warranty along with a pair of JBL headphones or a Swiss Military Bluetooth Speaker with every booking.. Many recently launched phones have been targeted at selfie-obsessed users, and the Gionee A1 is definitely an addition to that list. Some of its competitors are the Vivo V5 Plus ( Review ) which is priced way higher at Rs. 27,980, and the Oppo F1s ( Review ) which is positioned slightly lower at Rs. Other competitors include the Moto M and Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime ( Review ) - both of which are available for under Rs.

This is such a wonderful phone from Gionee that you have to give 5 star to this phone. The phone is pretty decent and totally value for money product. the display is quite bright and adaptive to the outside lights. It gets dim when you are in dark and you can use it very efficiently even if you are under direct sun light. You enjoy the display more when you play HD games on this phone. The graphic production is almost insane and very true to life. So far it is the best selfie phone i have ever used. While buying the phone, i was under impression that only Oppo or Vivo camera phones are the best selfie experts but this is baap of all camera phone at this price. And it is quite obvious also because they have used Sony sensors in this mobile phone. If you are planning to buy a bigger battery phone - this is the phone for you. No other phone can match the battery performance of this phone. I do not require to charge it for almost 2 days. And even when i try to charge - it charges very fast. The charging is indeed pretty fast. Even when you charge it via computer. I am very happy with this phone.. By himanshu pandey on 12 April 2017. Since the announcement of this phone, I wanted to buy Gionee A1 but I found price of Gionee A1 in India was better on OnlyMobiles.com because of the Rs.1,999 Instant Discount than Gionee A1 on Amazon. So, I have bought it from OnlyMobiles. I have got timely delivery and packaging of the phone was also very safe. The real cost of Gionee A1 is just Rs.18,000 (Thanks to the additional discount on payment via debit card). I have been using this phone since last 2 days and did not require to charge till now. 02) Gionee A1 comes with latest Android OS Nougat 7.0 and this is the best OS so far on any Android Mobile phones which I have ever used. 01) the phone is little bulky (but that is more because of the bigger battery). 02) There are too many applications given in the phone, which I do not want but I cannot delete them.

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. A decent option only if you can't buy online phones, but there are better selfie-centric phones in this price range. If you buy it, buy it for battery, display and Nougat.. Design Display Camera Battery, connectivity Performance Software Verdict. Gionee is one of the most consistent brands in the offline smartphone industry for several years. The company recently unveiled two new smartphones at MWC 2017—Gionee A1 and Gionee A1 Plus. Without much delay, Gionee rolled out the A1 smartphone in India in less than a month’s time. The smartphone costs Rs 19,000 and focuses on selfies and battery with a 16MP selfie camera and a 4010mAh battery.. The A1 targets the offline market and stands against the likes of Vivo V5 and Oppo F1. After almost a month of usage, I have experienced almost every side of the smartphone. Should you buy the Gionee A1 at this price point? Read on to find out.. Gionee A1 is one of those smartphones which do not carry anything striking in the design but still manage to look and feel good in hand. I have been using the matte black variant, which I feel looks much better than other colour variants. The finish looks premium and does not catch fingerprints in usual case scenarios.. The device is slightly bigger and bulkier due to the extra amount of juice it carries inside. But after using it for a week I found it pretty handy for me. But one-handed accessibility for those with tiny hands will be inconvenient.. The smartphone has slight curves on the edges to feel better in hands and the design helps it to fit in hands despite of slightly slippery texture. The power and volume buttons are on the right side and offer a good tactile feedback. There are two speaker grills at the bottom, one for the mic and other is the loudspeaker.. Looking at the overall design, the smartphone qualifies to be rated positively. The only downside is the bulk and size, which you can compromise for a bigger battery.. It offers a 5.5-inch full HD AMOLED panel, which definitely is one of the strengths of the device. The AMOLED panel with 1080p resolution produces punchy colours, strong contrast, and delivers a pleasant experience.. The UI offers three different colour profiles in the display settings—warm, neutral and cool. You can choose the one most suitable for your eyes. Although I prefer the warm tone, which looks a bit yellowish in the beginning but its comforting once you get used to it.. If you consider this display for multimedia experience, its highly possible that you'll be happy with it.. Being a selfie-centric smartphone, I expected a lot from the Gionee A1 in terms of camera; especially the front camera. It comes with a 13MP rear camera and a 16 MP front camera. The front camera looks solid on paper but I felt it was not as good as it should be. At least, to keep up with the company's 'Selfistan' drive. I don't rate the camera as bad, but it should have been better in terms of.. It captures great details in well lit conditions but the optimisation is slightly inconsistent. It uses beautify mode to tweak with your selfies to make them look better. In low light, the flash worked well in most of the conditions but the pictures tend to lose details in such conditions. I compared the front camera with other offline selfie-centric phones, and it fell slightly short in some areas.. Surprisingly, the 13MP rear camera performs much better than the expectations. I clicked a lot of pictures in each lighting scenario and got impressive results. By impressive I mean, the daylight shots showed decent details with well saturated colours and I managed to click some impressive shots in low light as well. The AMOLED display aids the pictures to look even more striking, but results on bigger screens may differ sometimes.. The Gionee A1 does a great job when it comes to battery life. It is powered by a 4010mAh battery that is not just heavy on paper, but also in real life usage. During basic to moderate usage, the A1 easily delivers more than 42 hours of backup. The fast charging support also ensures that the hefty battery gets fuelled under two hours.. After using the smartphone for a month now, I haven't faced any connectivity or reception issues. The output from the loudspeaker is loud and crisp; it can be heard easily in any corner of a big room but not in a noisy surrounding.. The fingerprint sensor is snappy but it can only be used to unlock the phone and struggles when oily or wet fingers are used.. The Gionee A1 is powered by MediaTek Helio P10 octa-core SoC along with 4GB of RAM. The processor is certainly not the best one in its segment but Gone has done well by moving on from MT6750, which is available on most other offline phones under 20K.. Coming to the performance, the A1 can satisfy a moderate user with smooth performance. If you use your smartphone aggressively and do multiple tasks at one point of time then it stumbles a bit occasionally. There is 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage to assure smooth functioning for a long period of time. While doing basic operations, I did not feel any unusual heating on the A1 but it does get warm while playing graphic greedy games. I noticed it getting abnormally hot while playing high-end games like Nova 3 on a stretch. It tends to show frame drops when you play high-end games but basic games run butterly smooth.. The A1 comes with Android 7.0 Nougat with Gionee’s custom Amigo 4.0 OS on top. It is a highly customised UI that offers tons of bloatware with revamped visual appeal. Since I am not a fan of heavily customised skins, I prefer installing a custom launcher on top to get a neater experience.. The good thing is that the UI is not unnecessarily filled up with useless apps and features and Gionee has kept things simpler. Most of the integrated features are pretty nifty and useful, unlike many other Chinese OEMs who incorporate every possible feature ignoring its relevance. It has also got some Nougat features to add to your experience with the phone.. It has features like Smart Gesture that let you fasten up your tasks using gestures. These gestures include, double tap to wake, glove mode, smart vibration reminders, auto answer when picked up and some more.. If you love customising your smartphone, then this UI can be pretty suitable for your needs. The only concern is with the bloatware that Goinee includes in most of its phones. The company should provide an option to uninstall these apps by choice.. The Gionee A1 is a good option for offline buyers under Rs 20k who are looking for a complete phone with good battery life. I would not recommend this phone to aggressive users as it may slow down a bit with time. The design and build, battery, display and camera fare well enough. The biggest issue is the heating problem, which may upset some demanding users. Presence of Android Nougat is worth the praise although it is not close to stock at all.. If you do not have an option to go for an online smartphone, then you can undoubtedly consider the Gionee A1 for you if battery is your concern..

Gionee A1 company's new A series device targets young consumers with it's high-resolution Selfie camera and big size battery. The Gionee A1 runs company’s own Amigo OS 4.0 based on latest Android 7.0 Nougat. The company specified internal storage is 64GB but then Gionee’s preloaded bloatware with Amigo occupies about a little over 12GB, hence users are left with around 52GB of free space on first boot, which although is sufficient, but we would have liked a little lesser bloatware anyhow.. The A1 supports microSD card expandability up to additional 256GB, but with hybrid SIM slot functionality. It also supports USB-OTG for external storage/ pen-drive.. The Amigo OS of Gionee this time around with version 4.0 is more refined. It looks more cleaner and the app icons etc. The notification drop down is similar to Android, however the quick settings menu need to be swiped up from the bottom. One issue that we had with the notifications was that you these are not visible on lock screen, something similar to Honor’s EMUI. So unless you unlock the device, you would not be able to see any kind of notifications or do a swipe up to get to quick settings menu.. So in short, you’ll need to swipe down for notifications and swipe up for quick settings.. Also, like many Chinese UIs, the Amigo OS too keeps all apps on home screen, means there is no app drawer like stock Android. If you need an app drawer, you can install Google Now Launcher or Nova. Other than that, you’ll find quite a few themes or wallpapers through ‘Theme Park’ and ‘Mood Wallpaper’ apps.. Gionee S11 with 4 cameras to launch in India in January 2018.

Gionee A1 comes with a metal unibody construction & has premium looks. However the phone is not very slim at 8.5mm, thanks to the massive battery which is rather preferred.

The Gionee A1 features a 16-megapixel Selfie camera with an LED flash and Phase Detection Auto Focus. Inside it has got an octa-core Helio P10 processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The handset comes in three colour options – Gray, Black and Gold. 19,999 and will be available through Amazon as well as all offline retail stores across India.. 19,999, the Gionee A1 can be considered as a good overall smartphone that is ready to take on the competition in offline space. The phone comes with two good quality cameras, especially the front 16-megapixel selfie camera. Also, the big 4010mAh battery doesn’t disappoint at all.. About the performance, the phone does work well with moderate multitasking but then heavy duty tasks will be an issue. Having said that consumers get 4GB RAM with 64GB of internal storage along with execllent battery and good cameras.

Gionee A1 review: It lasts long and captures good selfies. Updated: Saturday, April 1, 2017, 15:18 [IST]. Camera: Captures good Selfies but rear camera is just average Battery: Lives up to expectations Design: Premium metal built, but lacks imagination Display: Crisp 5.5-inch Full HD IPS Screen Software: A delight for users who love to customize their handsets, but you also get Bloatwares Processor, RAM and Storage Verdict. Gionee showcased two smartphones- Gionee A1 Plus and A1 in this year's Mobile World Congress (MWC 2017), Barcelona.. Premium design, , , , | Crisp Full HD screen | Long-lasting battery | Snappy fingerprint scanner | Intuitive UI. Rear camera could have been better | Design brings nothing new. Designed to please selfie lovers, the smartphones challenge the likes of Vivo V5, Vivo V5 Plus, OPPO F1s, OPPO F3 Plus and other selfie-centered smartphones priced in sub Rs. During an event in New Delhi, the company announced the launch of Gionee A1, however the bigger one- the A1 Plus skipped the launch for the time being. We are using the smartphone for around a week and here's what we think of the mid-ranger 'Gionee A1' selfie smartphone.. Please note that the highlight features of the smartphone are first taken in account in the following review.. The selfie-centered Gionee A1 features a 16MP front camera to please consumers who are bitten by the selfie bug. You also get LED flashlight at front that can brighten up the images in non-ideal light conditions, so that you capture even more selfies, and why not when the camera actually does a decent job capturing self portraits.. The pictures taken from the front camera look good on the full HD screen and have natural colour tones to them. The 16MP sensor is able to capture a wide angle view so that you can also fit your gang in the selfies you capture on parties and outings.. Gionee A1's direct competitor is Vivo V5. I tested both the handsets side by side and found that the images captured by the Vivo V5's 20MP camera are more detailed; however the 20MP camera is not the perfect fit for group selfies where Gionee A1 seems to take the lead.. You also get Face beauty mode that has now become a standard feature in most of the smartphones to soften the image in order to make your selfies look more appealing.. Coming on to the 13MP rear camera, it captures good quality images in well-lit conditions but the performance could have been better. The 13MP sensor captures fair amount of light and color to produce images with mostly accurate color tones.. Gionee A1 with 16MP selfie camera launched in India, pre-order begins on March 31. But the results in low-light situations are not impressive as noise becomes quite evident. Besides, I had a tough time in capturing macro shots as the sluggish 13MP rear sensor takes its sweet time to focus on subjects that are really close.. Moreover, the HDR mode is a bit off as no matter how firm you hold the device, the images look blurry. It seems the HDR algorithm just softens the images more than the required amount.. Where the camera excels is the number of modes and features it offers to users, which can truly please the photography enthusiast. You have a Pro mode that allows you to tweak ISO, exposure, shutter speed, white balance, etc.. You also get a variety of others including slow-motion, time-lapse, smart scene, text recognition, smart scan, GIF, PicNote, mood photo, card scanner, and even a translation mode that can come quite handy if you are an avid traveler.. Overall, Gionee A1 seems to be a decent camera device as far as front camera and the variety of modes and features the camera app has to offer. The rear camera is only good for day-light photography.. Coming on to second most important aspect of the Gionee A1, the smartphone is backed by a big 4,010 mAh battery unit that managed to last for a bit more than a day and half in my usage.. The smartphone was subjected to all customary day-today tasks such as calling, texting, social networking, high camera usage, video streaming through YouTube, etc. It is worth mentioning that after using the handset for a day and half, I had to activate the 'Power Saving Mode' and the 'Extreme Mode' to make it last for a bit longer.. Gionee A1 also supports ultra fast charging to give an instant boost to the large battery unit.. There's no denying the fact that almost every other Chinese smartphone launched in the market looks identical. Irrespective of the price-point, you get good specifications and features tucked inside metal and glass body. The same can be said for Gionee A1 that offers a premium metal unibody design, but fails to offer something new to the users.. Gionee A1 is made out of metal and feels quite sturdy in hands. The smartphone has a noticeable weight (182g) due to its large 4,080mAH battery unit, but the weight distribution is very well managed and the handset does not feel bulky while using with one hand.. You get a crisp 5.5-inch screen surrounded by white bezels. The right side of the handset has volume rockers and power button that offers good feedback, while the hybrid SIM card tray is placed on the left edge. You can click the power button thrice to trigger the panic button that automatically connects the call to the emergency number, a handy feature in emergency situation.. The clickable home button on the front has the fingerprint sensor embedded in it that unlocks the handset in a jiffy. However, the same home button does not offer a good tactile feedback upon pressing. The 3.5mm headphone jack is placed on top.. Overall, the Gionee A1 has an ergonomic design and looks quite premium, however there's nothing surprising about its design.. The Gionee A1 sports a 5.5-inch 1080P IPS display with 2.5D curved Corning Gorilla Glass protection. The display offers a pixel count of and 401 ppi making content (text, pictures, videos, etc.) vivid and crisp for a good viewing experience.. The screen also has good level of brightness and colours pop out quite well. Besides, the IPS panel makes sure the colours displayed have natural tone to them for a balanced multimedia viewing experience. I also tested the display in outdoors and the good sunlight legibility made it possible to use the smartphone in direct sunlight.. Gionee A1 runs on Gionee's proprietary Amigo OS 4.0 based on the latest Android 7.0 Nougat. The Amigo OS is one of the most intuitive and customizable software layer we have tested on Chinese Android handsets.. There's a dedicated online marketplace where you can download themes, wallpapers and widgets to customize the look and feel of your handset. The settings menu also allows you to set smart gestures and manage touch capacitive buttons functionality to operate the handset with an ease in everyday usage.. Besides, there are several nifty smart settings such as glove mode, edge bar that brings a window of predefined controls on the edges of the screen and skylight mode to make it easy to use the touch screen in case you have applied a flip cover on your smartphone.. The user interface is smooth and I did not come across any app crashes in my usage. Gionee has put efforts in customizing widgets and the overall look and feel, and the results are quite pleasing.. It is worth mentioning that the control center with the basic settings such as Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, etc. can be accessed by swiping up from the bottom, like you get with the iOS devices and not like the traditional Android smartphones.. Gionee A1 is a capable device as far as computing and multitasking is concerned. The smartphone is backed by a MediaTek Helio P10 chipset paired with 4GB of RAM. The handset can easily handle general tasks such as browsing, video playback, multiple apps, split screen feature where you can run two apps on a same screen, social networking apps and all day-to-day tasks.. I didn't come across any lag or slow downs at any point during light tasks. Moreover, heavy duty tasks such as photo editing and gaming also seemed to be just fine. However you will not get the kind of raw power that devices like OnePlus 3 and its category tend to deliver. But then the considerable price difference also needs to be taken in account.. Storage will not be an issue for users as Gionee A1 comes with 64GB of internal storage that can be expanded by up to 128GB via microSD card. As far as connectivity goes, Gionee A1 has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, dual-SIM support, 4G LTE and VoLTE and GPS.. The fingerprint scanner embedded on the home-button is quite snappy and I also did not face any call quality issues on the handset.. Gionee A1 seems to be a decent mid-range Android handset for consumers who love to capture selfies and don't want to compromise on battery performance. The smartphone feels sturdy and offers a premium design.. The 5.5-inch Full HD display is crisp and vivid and software performance is also smooth. And while the front camera delivers good selfies, the rear camera is just an average performer. Connectivity, storage and audio quality are also good on the handset. Buy it for long lasing battery and a good selfie experience.. Gizbot Stay updated with latest technology news & gadget reviews. gionee | mobiles | news | smartphones | android.

The 5.5-inch, FullHD, AMOLED panel looks great. It might be smaller than the one in the A1 Plus, but it is more pleasing to look at, with its punchy colors and infinite contrast.The A1 is compact in any way. With 8.5mm of thickness and 182 grams of weight, the device is pretty hefty. Still, you are getting a 4,010 mAh battery in return so it's worth it.Gionee's Ultrafast Charge solution makes this device better.Gionee has also designed and styled a custom charger to ship with the phones. So, that is one of the three pillars covered, as for the selfie one, the A1 does come with a 16MP, f/2.0 front snapper, complete with a flash. There are some software tricks to go along with the good camera as well, like advanced facial recognition and software bokeh effect.. Excellent battery backup VoLTE Supported Fingerprint Sensor. Hybrid SIM Slot Non-removable battery. Gionee A1 Review: Big on selfie, bigger on battery review 24th May, 2017. It offers a 5.5 inch full HD AMOLED panel, which definitely is one of the strengths of the device. The AMOLED panel with 1080p resolution produces punchy colors, strong contrast, and delivers a pleasant experience.Being a selfie-centric smartphone, I expected a lot from the Gionee A1 in terms of the camera; especially the front camera. It comes with a 13MP rear camera and a 16 MP front camera. The front camera looks solid on paper but I felt it was not as good as it should be. It is powered by a 4010mAh battery that is not just heavy on paper, but also in real life usage. During basic to moderate usage, the A1 easily delivers more than 42 hours of backup. The fast charging support also ensures that the hefty battery gets fuelled under two hours.The Gionee A1 is powered by MediaTek Helio P10 octa-core SoC along with 4GB of RAM. The processor is certainly not the best one in its segment but Gone has done well by moving on from MT6750, which is available on most other offline phones under 20K.The A1 comes with Android 7.0 Nougat with Gionee’s custom Amigo 4.0 OS on top. It is a highly customized UI that offers tons of bloatware with revamped visual appeal.. Android Nougat Good battery life Impressive display. Heats up while gaming Bloatware Bulky Average camera. Gionee A1 Review 17th May, 2017. Gionee has as added a new selfie-centric smartphone in its product line-up called as the Gionee A1.The Gionee A1 offers a 16MP front-facing camera which is the highlight of the device. The front camera features f/2.0 aperture, 5P lens, selfie flash, and 1/3.06-inch sensor. The selfie flash technology on the device is believed to offer enhanced facial aspects in selfies even in low light conditions. The company claims that it will spread the light onto user’s face consistently and softly. This helps for capturing improved facial complexion, blush, and natural glow.. In addition, Gionee is touting its own facial enhancement algorithm which is claimed to be competent for detection of user’s face and apply custom beauty settings in the images. Other selfie feature includes the bokeh-selfie mode which let users blur the background.. Write a Review on Gionee A1. Heading* Summary* Rating*. (Your rating: 0 / 5).

Looking to buy a new smartphone? Here’s our full review of Gionee A1.. Technology Tech Reviews Gionee A1 review: A great phone, but it’s not. Rating: 3.5 out of 5. It may lack some of the hype, but the fact remains it offers acceptable camera capabilities, decent hardware performance and a long-lasting battery life. Gionee A1 bears a striking resemblance to phones made by other “Chinese” manufacturers. Even with the brightness set at 50 per cent, the screen looks rather bright. Apps launched almost instantaneously, and I was able to open multiple Chrome tabs. I’m still trying to figure out the reason for the absence of a USB Type-C port on the A1. This is not the best fingerprint scanner I have used to date.. Updated: April 5, 2017 9:10 pm. Gionee S10 Lite launched at Rs 15,999: Price, features and. specs Gionee A1 Plus, A1 Lite prices slashed by the company: All you need to. know Gionee S11, S11s and M7 Plus launched: Price,. What makes a smartphone praiseworthy? Is it the design, the camera, battery life? In my opinion a good phone is one that can handle all those things with ease. It doesn’t have to be bezel-less, nor does it need to be razor thin. All I need is a reliable phone that works for me.. Gionee A1 is probably one such option that convinced me to look beyond my usual set of favourites when it comes to smartphones. For the record, Gionee A1 isn’t the most distinctive smartphone in the market. It may lack some of the hype, but the fact remains it offers acceptable camera capabilities, decent hardware performance and a long-lasting battery life. Gionee A1 specifications : 5.5-inch FHD LCD display (1080p resolution) | MediaTek Helio P10 SoC | 4GB RAM + 64GB storage (expandable to 256GB) | 13MP rear camera + 16MP front camera | 4010mAh battery | Android 7.0 Nougat with Amigo UI. Gionee A1 bears a striking resemblance to phones made by other “Chinese” manufacturers. You’d have a hard time telling them apart. But it would have been great to see a distinctive design, like Gionee did in the past with Elife E6.. But this is still a good looking phone. I got the ‘Grey’ colour version of the device for review, and it looks great from all angles. The metal back and the buttons are great to the touch and the addition of 2.5D curved glass at the front allows the panel to blend well with the metal frame. The A1 measures 8.3 mm thick and weighs 183 grams. Despite its size, it doesn’t feel bulky.. The home button on the front features a fingerprint scanner flanked by two additional touch buttons for multi task and back. If you head into the settings, you get the option of swapping the functions of each side. The volume up/down and power switch is still on the right. That leaves the dual-SIM (hybrid) tray to occupy the phone’s left side, while the bottom features a micro-USB connector flanked by the mono loudspeaker. On the top of the phone there is a 3.5-mm headphone jack. Plus there is the IR blaster which has high utility.. Featuring a 5.5-inch full HD 1080p resolution, Gionee A1 screen has 401 pixels per inch. The display is full of colour, and retains the crispness. Even with the brightness set at 50 per cent, the screen looks rather bright. Plus, you also get the option to set the color temperature of the screen which can be adjusted as required in the Settings menu. Neutral mode was selected by default, and it gives the A1 a bit more balanced colour temperature.. To make sure it keeps all that power going all day, there’s a 4,010mAh battery built into the body. Gionee A1 with the GPS on and using it to constantly stay in touch with friends and family via WhatsApp and social media. I’ve had the A1 (used with a 4G SIM) nearly last an entire day without plugging in. While it’s not quite the two-day battery promised by Gionee, it can make it to a day and a half fairly comfortably.. Gionee promised a lot about the cameras on the A1. While the A1 doesn’t come with dual rear cameras, like the Honor 6X and Micromax Dual 5, its 13-megapixel rear and 16-megapixel front cameras are pretty capable.. In bright daylight conditions, the A1’s camera performs well, and its 13-megapixel sensor (f/2.0) captures a lot of detail. The white balance is accurate and colours are vivid without being oversaturated and unrealistic. Auto-focus is fast and the A1 also copes very well with macro shots. The lack of OIS means it can’t match the sharpness levels of the Galaxy S7 and G5. Otherwise, the camera seems functional for day-to-day use. During my time with the phone, low-light performance was surprisingly good. The 1080p video recording does a good job of focusing on objects nearby and further away.. The A1 is pitched as a selfie-centric smartphone. The front camera has a higher resolution like most phones’ front cameras these days, and lets you capture a lot of details in your face. Its front-facing camera is 16-megapixels coupled with a LED flash, so you can snap a selfie of yourself in the dark. The results from the front camera are quite good. The A1, like many selfie-centric smartphones, offer multiple beauty modes that lets soften an image in an attempt to make you younger.. Gionee A1 uses a mid-range MediaTek Helio P10 SoC. It’s an octa-core processor clocked at 2.0Ghz, paired with 4GB RAM and 64GB of native storage which is further expandable up to 256GB via a microSD card slot. In our testing, the Helio P10 zipped through day-to-day tasks fairly well. Apps launched almost instantaneously, and I was able to open multiple Chrome tabs.. While Gionee has not used a premium processor, throughout my usage the phone was zippy. You needn’t worry that the phone slowing down while playing a game like Real Racing 3 or Asphalt 8. On AnTuTu, the Gionee A1 scored 45,772 while the GeekBench 4 score was 2598 on multi-core, well behind the OnePlus 3 .. The A1 runs the latest version of Google ’s Android OS –Nougat. The OS has been customised with a skin called “ Amigo OS 4.0”. The interface is heavily skinned (as expected) and comes preloaded with apps such as Amazon Shopping, Xender, Hotoday, Truecaller, Facebook , WhatsApp and Messenger. Even though Gionee’s native Amigo OS is significantly improved, I still prefer the standard Android interface.. The A1 comes with a micro USB instead of USB-C, which all premium mid range Android smartphones have been using for a year. I’m still trying to figure out the reason for the absence of a USB Type-C port on the A1.. The fingerprint sensor on the Gionee A1 is embedded on the home button. This is not the best fingerprint scanner I have used to date. I found that it’s not so quick and accurate, and around 40 per cent of the time the fingerprint sensor failed to wake up the phone.. The A1 is lacking near-field communications (NFC) which could be crucial when Google rolls out Android Pay in India. Keeping this in mind, Gionee seems to have missed a chance by not adding an NFC chip into the A1.. At Rs 19,999, Gionee A1 is a well-packaged smartphone, barring a few trade-offs. The build quality is excellent, the all-metal finish is appealing, day-long battery life and the screen is good with popping colours – even if it lacks an AMOLED panel. Although I wish the phone had a better processor and unskinned Android, the phone doesn’t really disappoint. There is some competition from the Oppo F1 Plus, Moto G5 Plus and Redmi Note 4 and you should take a look at all these options before buying Gionee A1..
