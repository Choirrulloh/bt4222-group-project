The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Not quite a budget bargain, and certainly no mid-range marvel. Awkwardly straddling the budget and mid-range categories, the Xperia E5 doesn't quite do enough to earn a recommendation in either. There's nothing particularly wrong with it, but you can get better smartphones for around the same price.. Sony Xperia E5 price and availability Sony style for the snap-happy Design and display A design you won't be ashamed to pull out of your pocket Everything looks sharp on the 720p display Thanks to Vodafone for providing an Xperia E5 for review. The Sony Xperia E5 is one of Sony's cheapest Android smartphones; however, the Japanese electronics giant has never done budget particularly well.. [Update: The Xperia E5 price has recently dropped, making it a more attractive budget offering.]. It's a premium brand – and the entry-level Android smartphone space has never been more competitive, so the Xperia E5 had its work cut out to make an impression.. Expectations of what you can get for your money in the budget sphere have changed dramatically in the last couple of years, with the Moto line and a flood of Chinese newcomers offering increasingly impressive handsets at ever-decreasing prices.. The MediaTek processor, 1.5GB of RAM and 5-inch 720p display are slightly below par for its price tag, but the 13MP main camera is a pleasant surprise, while the classic, industrial Sony design is classier than some of the competition.. At launch, the Sony Xperia E5 price was £150, which put it up against the likes of the Moto G4 and the Oppo F1 , but now it can be snapped up for around £120 SIM free, or free on contracts starting at £14.99.. That makes it highly affordable, but as it's more than a year old now, it's not as widely available. You can still find it at Carphone Warehouse, Argos and Amazon though.. Two things immediately stand out about the Sony Xperia E5: the sexy design and the 13MP camera. If you love Sony's style, then the E5 is going to appeal.. The E5's budget predecessors have always resembled ugly cousins to Sony's main lines – a little too chubby and squat to draw any admiring glances. But the E5 doesn't look out of place next to the current Xperia X lineup. This is a phone you won't be ashamed to pull out of your pocket.. Sony has also thrown a 13MP main camera into the mix here, alongside a selfie-friendly 5MP front-facing snapper. On paper that's a major draw for a phone this price, and it's a good performer in favourable conditions, although there are issues with low-light shots.. The camera app has also been updated from those in previous budget Sony phones, and offers a manual mode, so you can tweak settings to your heart's content. We'll dig into the camera some more, and look at a few sample images, in the camera section.. You can tell at a glance that the Xperia E5 is part of the Sony family. It's a gently rounded rectangle with big bezels top and bottom.. Like the Sony Xperia X, XA and X Performance, the Xperia E5 sports a 5-inch display. Sony seems to have decided that five inches is the optimum size for a smartphone display, and while everyone else goes large, Sony has recalibrated its lineup to this more manageable size.. The E5 is also about the same size as its relations in terms of dimensions, just a tiny bit thicker, measuring 144 x 69 x 8.2mm. It's lighter, too, at 147g, thanks to its polycarbonate construction, but the matte finish feels and looks good.. You'll find the micro USB port for charging on the bottom edge, the headphone jack up top, and a fiddly flap that opens to reveal the SIM card and microSD card slots on the left spine.. It's when you look at the buttons on the right edge that you notice the first major departure from Sony's Xperia X phones – there's no dedicated camera button.. We usually find one at the bottom of the right spine, in the perfect place to press when you hold the phone in landscape view, as you naturally do to snap a shot. This is a real shame, especially since the camera is the star of the show here.. There's also, unsurprisingly, no fingerprint sensor in the power button. In fact, the E5 doesn't even get the old, circular, silver signature power button, as on the Xperia XA. There's just a tiny plastic lozenge for the power button, with a volume rocker above it.. For some reason, Sony has moved the volume rocker to the very top of the right edge, which makes it harder to get at when you're holding the phone one-handed. It's much further down on the X range, in a more comfortable position, so we're not sure why Sony has moved it here on the E5.. All the buttons feel solid, with a satisfying click, but the volume rocker placement is unfortunate – and we would have loved to see a physical shutter button for the camera.. The 5-inch display on the Sony Xperia E5 has a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels, just like the Xperia XA. That gives it a pixel density of 294ppi, which on a phone this size is perfectly adequate – everything looks sharp, and it's comfortable to read on.. Get too close, or sit it next to a higher-resolution phone and you can see its limitations, but it's a decent display. Colours look quite realistic, and you can crank the brightness up high enough to read outdoors, or low enough to kill the glare in a darkened room.. The only issue we had with the display was the poor viewing angles. If you aren't looking at it head-on, it dims considerably and doesn't look anywhere near as good.. Our Xperia E5 review unit is a dark grey, almost black colour, but you can get the phone in white, too. It's solidly built, and a really nice size for comfortable one-handed use. In this price bracket the Xperia E5 is a definite looker, and you could easily mistake it for one of Sony's more expensive releases.. Next Page What's it like to use?.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. posted by Chris P.. Android - Android + Sony - Sony +. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction Perhaps the bravest of them all, the Sony Xperia E series has a challenging task set upon it: to convince buyers within the ruthlessly competitive low-end market to pick it over increasingly strong alternatives. This has been a tough ask for a long while, specifically given the rather uncompetitive pricing that Sony management has traditionally agreed upon. But the Xperia E5 seems stronger than ever, with significantly better hardware compared to its predecessor in essentially every area: design, display, power-crunching, and even imaging. On paper, it's a worthy successor, but sold for the equivalent of about $210 (€199) in Europe, is that enough to make it a success? We take a look. Design Attractive, sturdy design that is sure to tempt buyers on a budget. If there's one thing the Xperia E5 has going for it, it's design. Unlike previous E-line devices—which looked decidedly low end—one would have a hard time calling this anything but reasonably attractive. More so at this price point, and especially compared to the rather mundane-looking competitors. In typical Sony style, the E5's form factor is that of a pleasantly rounded rectangle with evenly sized top and bottom bezel—a welcome change from previous Sony designs. There are no seemingly precious materials adorning the phone , which is entirely made out of polycarbonate, but it honestly feels solid and well-constructed. The back plate has a matte finish, which despite everything, actually makes this a far more ergonomically sound phone than the likes of even the Xperia Z5. Sony aficionados, however, will be quick to notice the missing—and kind of signature—dedicated physical shutter key. While we're fine with this particular omission, we felt the volume rocker, located on the upper side of the frame, is a bit too far for comfortable use, even with larger-than-average hands. That said, the power key is well in reach, and both buttons offer a satisfying click when pressed. Display Surprisingly good! At a time when we're still witnesses of poorly calibrated panels even at the higher end, the Xperia E5 is a welcome change—especially at the lower end. Upgrading upon the resolution of its predecessor, the E5 features a 5-inch, 720 x 1280 pixel display of the LCD type, ensuring an adequate viewing experience—though some graininess is definitely noticeable. In terms of screen properties, as mentioned earlier, the E5 doesn't disappoint and brings peak brightness of over 500 nits, so you won't have to strain your eyes too much under direct sunlight. At 4 nits, minimum brightness is also sufficiently low for the night owls among us to enjoy the E5 before bed when the lights are out. Finally, color accuracy is pretty decent for a device of this caliber. We've got an excellent color temperature, decently accurate gamma across the brightness spectrum, and relatively lifelike colors for the most part.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Sony Xperia E5 Compare.

The Xperia X performance gets a 6.3 with a SD 820, 3gb of ram, 32gb of storage, 23mp hybrid auto focus camera, 13mp selfies camera, aluminum construction for $699. Yet this phone gets a gets a 8 with a Mediatek 1.3ghz processor with 1.5gb of ram, 16gb of storage, a worse camera for $210. So that means the iPhone 6s should have received a score of 6 or less then.. (Posts: 1591; Member since: 01 Aug 2015). posted on 30 Jun 2016, 11:05. A different PA author did this review. If you read the reviews page for page the X Performance is the far superior device. It's got to be the "value for your dollar" opinion which makes the scores so different.. posted on 30 Jun 2016, 11:16. Different price ranges, and being judged against different standards.. (Posts: 96; Member since: 02 Mar 2015). posted on 30 Jun 2016, 13:34. yea agreed.if a flagship is getting a 6 or a 9 it should be in relation to other flagship smartphones.same 4 midrangers and budget phones.

(Posts: 163; Member since: 12 Aug 2013). posted on 30 Jun 2016, 09:44. Sony has always loved their midrangers and lowends more than their flagship. Other than Xperia E5, I have another perfect example. - The camera completely destroys Z5's and actually putting up a good fight against S7 and S6 camera (I have proof of this). - The battery is giving me constant 7h 30 min of screen time despite it is only 2600mah and paired with reportedly energy inefficient MediaTek X10 chipset. - Speaker is only single but the output quality is louder and clearer than Xperias with stereo speakers. I used to be a die hard sony fan, but what they do in 2016 really saddens me. If Sony doesn't change, then Xperia M5 is going to be my last sony phone.

Stop comparing these phones to the likes of redmi's and other low cost phones. Big companies have to spend a lot on marketing and maintaining Proper after sales services , international availability , brand recognition .. and not to mention setting up proper offline channels .. 80-85 % of sales are still offline. while sony still has a lot of flaws ( especially price ) but compare it to samsung , htc and the likes and not against Redmi's and oppo's. By that logic every site should give lower scores to Samsung galaxy S and note series , htc .. when you only get mid range from samsung/htc specs for 400 $ vs flagship specs from redmi for 400$. (Posts: 6747; Member since: 30 Sep 2014). posted on 30 Jun 2016, 22:37. obviously because they hate chinese brand... FHD, SD650, 3GB RAM, 4000mAh battery at $180 get 6.8/10.

Sony Xperia E5 Review: In Depth. Sony Xperia E5 Review: Screen and media. Sony Xperia E5 Review: Performance and battery life. Screen size 5-inches Screen resolution 1280x720 OS Android 6.0 Marshmallow Rear Camera 13-megapixel Front camera 5-megapixel Processor Mediatek Memory 1.5GB Storage 16GB + microSD 4G LTE Yes. Decent battery life Respectable budget performance Rugged. Sony Xperia E5 Review: Sony’s cheapest Xperia phone of 2016 costs just £99, while packing a 13-megapixel camera and sharp 5-inch HD screen. Here’s our full Xperia E5 review, including what we think of the Xperia E5’s camera tech, performance, battery life and everything else.. Sony Mobile’s big focus in 2016 has so far been the Xperia X series , and we’re already. fans of the Xperia X , even though you can pick up similar rival phones (such as the OnePlus 3 and Galaxy A5 2016) for over £100 less.. However, the cheapest member of the Xperia X family, the Xperia XA , was a crushing disappointment. You see, the XA initially wowed us with a gorgeous edge-to-edge screen design, but performance and battery life let us down and made the phone tough to recommend.. Undeterred, Sony has just released a new budget phone, the Xperia E5, which costs a measly £99 yet packs almost the same specs as the Xperia XA. So, is the Xperia E5 hampered by those same problems, and how does it compare to other £100 rivals like the Moto E3 and Voda’s Smart Prime 7 ?. Read next: Sony Xperia XA vs Xperia E5. Remember when cheap mobile phones used to feel like plasticky kids toys, which would crumble apart if a flea so much as farted near them? Well, no more. Now affordable smartphones are (on the whole) solidly-built handsets and occasionally even rather good looking.. So it is with the Xperia E5, which retains some of Sony’s iconic design language despite being by far the cheapest Xperia phone of 2016. Of course, at this price point you can’t expect the same stunning edge-to-edge aesthetics of the Xperia XA, but the Xperia E5 still boasts quite narrow bezels which make it a comfortable fit for the hand.. There’s a pleasing heft to the Xperia E5’s only-slightly-chunky frame, which is definitely reassuring. I’ve carried the phone about in my rucksack, filled with all manner of pointy objects, and after several days there’s nary a scratch or mark to be seen.. You can’t pull the back off, so the Xperia E5’s SIM card slot and memory card slot are accessed via a handy flap on the left edge. The headphone jack is up top and there’s a power button and volume rocker on the right edge (but no dedicated camera button).. Like the Xperia XA before it, Sony’s Xperia E5 rocks a 5-inch IPS screen. However, there are some differences beyond the lack of edge-to-edge design.. For a start, the Xperia E5’s display produces warmer colours, which makes it a little easier on the eye in low light – although whites do have a slight yellow tint to them. There’s also no support for the Sony Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2 in the Xperia E5’s display settings, or Sony’s Super Vivid Mode (which artificially boost the look of photos and video).. Still, for £99 you can’t expect the moon on a stick and the Xperia E5’s screen is powerful enough to cut through glare, complete with adaptive brightness to save battery power when needed. It’s also sharp enough to make your high-res movies look decent, thanks to the 720p HD resolution.. And while the Xperia E5’s dinky speaker, housed on the bottom of the phone, isn’t exactly a powerful blaster, it’s perfectly fine for kicking back with YouTube vids. Connect some headphones if you want to enjoy your tunes, though.. Streaming video and music via the likes of Netflix and Spotify is becoming increasingly popular, but I always like to have a big collection of movies and albums on my phone for those offline moments. Thankfully the Xperia E5’s 16GB of storage can be quickly boosted by up to a further 256GB using the microSD memory card slot.. At this price point, you’d be foolhardy for expecting much beyond the bog-standard smartphone features. Still, the Xperia E5 does boast the latest version of Android (Marshmallow), with Sony’s attractive, colourful launcher plastered over the surface.. Read next: Best budget phones of 2016. In fact, the Xperia E5 desktops and menus have the same look and feel as the Xperia X phones, which is a nice touch. Sadly you don’t get most of the cool Sony features found in the Xperia X, such as support for Hi-Res audio and the ability to stream games from your PS4. Not too surprising given the Xperia E5’s cut-price performance.. However, you do get Sony’s interactive help guide, which is a handy little feature for anyone who isn’t used to smartphones or Android handsets. This explains how to use all of the Xperia E5’s features and set it up just how you like, with links to relevant settings menus and the rest.. We’re impressed to see support for 5GHz WiFi on the Xperia E5, something that’s often missing from budget blowers. Occasionally the Xperia E5’s WiFi crapped out, throwing up ‘connection error’ messages when I tried to access the Play Store or YouTube for instance, but thankfully these were always corrected by backing out of the app and jumping back in.. Read next: Best Sony phones you can buy right now. This was my main area of concern when I first slipped my SIM card inside the Xperia E5. I’d already struggled with the hampered performance of the Xperia XA, and the Xperia E5 uses an even more basic Mediatek processor, backed up by just 1.5GB of RAM. I’ve also only just reviewed the similarly cheap Wileyfox Spark, another Mediatek mobile that was rendered pretty much unusable by its juddery user experience.. After running our benchmarking tests, I was even more uneasy. AnTuTu awarded the Xperia E5 a paltry score of 32k, which is a big drop from the Xperia XA’s 47k score.. However, after several days of use, the Xperia E5 has actually proved itself a respectable budget blower. There’s an occasional lingering pause when you try and open an app, but Android runs surprisingly well, as did all of the apps I tested out. For £99, I wouldn’t expect anything more.. You can also indulge in some light gaming on the Xperia E5. Racing games and scrolling platformers run with a decent frame rate, although we did notice that the top end of the phone started to get a little toasty after about ten minutes of action.. As for battery life, the Xperia E5 religiously made it through a full 24 hours on a single charge, even with a fair bit of use. That’s a definite improvement on the Xperia XA, which would just about make it to the early evening before dying.. The Xperia E5 packs a 13-megapixel camera just like the Xperia XA, but there’s a definite dip in quality between the two phones – again, unsurprising given the massive jump in asking price.. Sony’s usual camera interface is in play, but Superior Auto mode is replaced with a bog-standard ‘Auto Scene Recognition’ mode. This tends to produce photos with serious over-saturation when you’re shooting in bright conditions, as you can see from our example shots. There’s plenty of detail packed into every photo however and the Xperia E5 does a decent job when conditions are overcast, or when snapping indoors.. The Xperia E5’s camera supports image tracking, where the lens tries to keep a selected object in focus automatically, but it’s a dud of a feature. Moving objects are often quickly lost and I found that focusing was a real struggle at times even when shooting a static scene. As soon as I turned off image tracking in the camera settings, the E5 behaved itself more often.. There’s a single LED flash on the back of the phone, which is essential when shooting photos in low-light conditions; the Xperia E5’s camera lens really doesn’t work well in the dark, like pretty much every budget snapper. I also found that the Xperia E5 struggled with up-close macro shots, producing blurry results every time.. As for video, you can shoot up to Full HD 1080p home movies at 30 frames-per-second. However, once again the results are less than stunning, with bright conditions proving a stick point as before. There’s no image stabilisation built in, so any movements are replicated as juddering and shaking in the video.. The E5’s 5-megapixel selfie camera is perfectly decent but again struggles in tricky lighting conditions.. If you’re after a phone to capture all of your precious family memories, I’d say it’s worth upgrading to something like the Moto G4. The Xperia E5 will just about do the job if you simply want to shoot some quick pics to share online.. Sony’s Xperia E5 is one of the cheapest Xperia phones you can nab these days, but holds up remarkably well compared with rivals like the Wileyfox Spark. Attractive and solid design work, respectable performance and battery life, and a decent HD screen all make for a worthy £100 handset.. Thanks to MobileFun for the Xperia E5 review sample.

Marcus Herbrich ( translated by Mark Riege), 06/09/2017. Android Touchscreen Smartphone. Solid entry into the smartphone world. In our test, Sony's Xperia E5 entry model presents itself as a solid smartphone in the lower price range. You can find out in our review whether a purchase is worthwhile in light of the strong competition..

Best Notebooks for University Students Â». Top Windows alternatives to Apple's MacBook series Â». Â» Tablets , Â» Windows Tablets Â» Smartphones. For the original German review, see here .. With the fifth generation of the E series, the Japanese electronics manufacturer extends its product portfolio by another entry model. For a current street price of about 130 Euros (~$145, in the US it is available for example from Wal-Mart for $179), the Sony Xperia E5 offers a MediaTek quad-core processor. which is supported by 1.5 GB of RAM, an NFC chip, and a 13-MP main camera. The smartphone has 16 GB of internal storage.. The 5-inch single-SIM device is available in black or white color. There are many competitors in this price range, and imported smartphones in particular offer technical specs that are considerably better in some parts. Among them are the UMI Max. But there are also entry models in the local market, such as the Acer Liquid Zest Plus , Coolpad Modena 2 , Gigaset GS160, LG K8 2017 ,. and ZTE Blade V7 Lite , that are competing models..

Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. With a size of 144 x 69 millimeters (~5.7 x 2.71 inches), the Xperia E5 is a compact device for current standards that lies in the hand comfortably. As is typical for Sony, the display bezels at the top and bottom are relatively large, which is reflected in a display to surface ratio of only 69%.. The workmanship and selection of materials are on a satisfactory level for an entry device. The back cover does not feel cheap by any means, but it does not advertise the quality of the. UHANS S1 or Vernee Mars , which are made from glass and metal respectively. The key for volume adjustment and the on/off key on the right side of the device are made from plastic as well and offer a slightly spongy pressure point, although they are positioned well and can be reached easily..

The 16 GB internal eMMC storage is appropriate for an entry device. After subtracting the operation system storage, about 10.6 GB remains available for the user. In addition, the storage can be extended by up to 200 GB via a microSD card, which can also be incorporated into the internal storage.. A micro USB 2.0 connector at the bottom of the device serves to charge the Xperia E5. Connecting external data storage via USB OTG does not work. Further features of the Sony smartphone include a status LED for notifications and an NFC chip and Miracast for wireless media-streaming. In our test with a Sony Android TV, transferring the display content to an external monitor works without problems.. For the operating system, Sony bets on Google's Android version 6.0 and overlays it with its own manufacturer user interface. Since its appearance in summer of 2016, there was no update to the current Android 7 version until now. Seeing that the current security patch is on the level of September 2016, an update seems rather unlikely.. Even though compared to Google's stock Android, the system interface reworked by Sony shows some visual adjustments in particular in the settings menu and notification bar, it seems to closely follow vanilla Android. It is also positive that there are only few preinstalled apps and there is hardly any bloatware.. As we can also see in other devices in this price range, the integrated WLAN module of the Xperia E5 only masters the IEEE-802.11 a/b/g/n standards. A t almost -40 dBm i n close proximity to the router (Telekom Speedport, W921V), the damping is comparatively low for an entry device. The Wi-Fi transfer rates between the Xperia E5 and our Linksys EA 8500 reference router are in a typical range for entry level smartphones.. 4, the single-SIM smartphone accesses the Internet at up to 150 Mbit/s for downloads. All the LTE frequencies relevant in Germany as well as quad-band GSM and the UMTS frequencies of 850, 900, 1900, 1700, and 2100 MHz are supported. In addition, the Sony smartphone has version 4.1 of Bluetooth and an NFC chip for near field communication between mobile devices..

An integrated GPS receiver enables the Sony smartphone to locate its position. Outdoors, the position is located with an accuracy of four meters. Indoors, the satellite signal was insufficient to locate the position.. In our practically relevant test where we record the route distance with the GPS module of the Xperia E5 and the Garmin Edge 500 bicycle computer in parallel, on the almost 12-km (~7.5 miles) route, the Sony smartphone shows a discrepancy of about 100 meters to the professional GPS reference device. The achieved accuracy is very good for an affordable device like the Xperia E5.. In the test, we liked the call quality of the Xperia E5 very much. The caller is easily understandable and we were also understood clearly. The telephone app corresponds to a large extent to the standard Google telephone app. The user interface is simple and comprehensible.. The camera module on the back of the Xperia E5 has a 13 MP resolution. In optimal light conditions, the pictures offer a good color reproduction rich in contrast. However, the white balance and richness of detail in the photos cannot convince. The sharpness achieved by the auto-focus is also not optimal. As soon as the light conditions worsen, the image starts to become noisy, and in sunny surroundings the camera shows problems with overexposure.. On the front of the device is a built-in 5-MP camera, the quality of which is satisfactory for selfies and video-calling. Overall, the pictures taken with the camera module turn out too dark. Videos can be recorded with the main camera as well as the front camera in 1080p quality at 30 images per second.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. Besides the test device, the carton contains some short instructions, a modular power supply rated at 4.25 watts (5 V, 0.85 A), and a USB charging cable. Earphones are not included with the Xperia E5.. Sony offers a 24-month warranty for its entry-level smartphone.. Navigation of the device occurs through the usual Android onscreen keys for "Back," "Multitasking," and "Home." The capacitive multi-touchscreen reacts reliably to input with up to five fingers, which is implemented quickly and without long delays.. As input options, both the SoftKey and Google's stock Android keyboard are preinstalled.. The LCD display of the Xperia E5 measures 12.7 cm (5-inches) in the diagonal and has a high-definition resolution (1280x720 pixels). With this, the IPS panel achieves a pixel density of 294 ppi, which should ensure a sufficiently sharp reproduction of the display content in everyday life. However, from a normal viewing distance, pixel structures are quite visible.. Displaying a pure white area, the liquid crystal display achieves an average brightness of 534 cd/mÂ² and so is illuminated brighter than the competition. The minimum display brightness of the display is quite high at 50.2 cd/mÂ². In addition, our test evaluates the brightness with an even distribution of bright and dark areas (APL-50). Here we could only measure a brightness of 451 cd/mÂ².. 539 cd/m² 542 cd/m² 543 cd/m² 521 cd/m² 538 cd/m² 539 cd/m² 531 cd/m² 526 cd/m² 523 cd/m². 96 % Center on Battery: 538. cd/m²) ΔE Color 5.7 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 4.7 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.51.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 8995 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. For an IPS panel, the contrast ratio (1630:1) as well as the black value (0.33 cd/mÂ²) are merely a good average, falling into the middle of the field of competitors. In our practically relevant APL50 test, the black value of the panel slightly improved to 0.31 cd/mÂ² at a contrast of 1455:1. The deviations in the color reproduction measured with the photo spectrometer and the CalMAN analysis software are relatively low, considering the cost of the device. In the bright areas, the grayscale also shows a barely visible blue tint, causing the image to appear slightly cool. The sRGB color-space coverage is very good..

This means that the measured response time is similar to the average of all tested devices (42.2 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Outdoors, the liquid crystal display is easily readable. On sunny days, the brightness and the contrast of the display are slightly too low to reliably allow easy reading of the content in direct sunlight. Thanks to IPS technology, the viewing-angle stability is very good. From very steep viewing angles, the image appears slightly darker and depending on the tilt of the display, a slight yellow or blue color inversion becomes visible..

The mid-range processor is manufactured in the 28-nm process and has four CPU cores based on the 64-bit capable Cortex A53 architecture. The CPU is supported by an ARM Mali T720 (MP1). graphics processor and 1.5 GB DDR3 RAM.. In everyday life, the performance ensures a smoothly running system and is very good for the MediaTek MT6735. There are hardly any stutters or hanging, and if there is, it is only during multitasking - Sony did a really good job here. Our subjective performance impression is confirmed by the benchmarks and browser performance. Compared to the MT6735 competition, the results of the Xperia E5 are very good. However, our Chinese Vernee Mars. competitors offer the clearly better MediaTek SoC with the Helio P10 MT6755. and therefore also have correspondingly higher benchmark results.. The performance of the internal 16 GB eMMC storage while reading and writing data is in the higher range of the comparison values. The performance capabilities of the integrated microSD-card slot are above average for the price class as well. We checked its speed with our Toshiba Exceria Pro M401 reference storage card (max. read: 95 MB/s, write: 80 MB/s) and at 65 MB/s (read) and 46 MB/s (write), the access rates are above the competing devices.

Besides OpenGL ES 3.1, the Mali-T720. graphics unit also masters OpenCL 1.1 and DirectX 11. However, the MP1 variant inside the Xperia E5 is only scaled by a single cluster which clocks at 600 MHz. 3D games from the Android Play Store that are more extravagant cannot be played smoothly. During the Modern Combat 5 and Real Racing 3. game titles we tested, there was repeated stuttering and long loading times were the rule. The touchscreen and position sensor worked well in the test.. During load, the back and the front of the Xperia E5 warm up unevenly. While in the test we measure a maximum of 44 Â°C (111 Â°F) in the front, the back has a slightly higher maximum surface temperature of 45.6 Â°C (114 Â°F). The temperatures that develop under load can be clearly felt in everyday operation, in particular in the bottom third of the case.. 44 °C 41.1 °C 35.3 °C. 42.6 °C 43.3 °C 36.9 °C. 41.8 °C 43 °C 35.5 °C.

The speaker on the bottom of the case only achieves a maximum volume of 77 dB(A) in our test. With that, the mono speaker is not really the most powerful in the smartphone segment, although the volume is sufficient for everyday life.. The Xperia E5 cannot really score with sound quality in the test: at higher volumes the sound becomes tinny and distorted. As expected, the sound image is not very linear and. The pink-noise diagram shows that lower frequencies are barely audible.. For a reproduction with more bass, you can use the 3.5 mm connector.

Frequency diagram in comparison (checkboxes above can be checked/unchecked!). In our measurement of the power consumption, the Xperia E5 is relatively inefficient. Compared to the UMi Max , the power consumption is clearly higher despite the smaller display and weaker processor..

At 7 hours and 2 minutes in our WLAN test with an adjusted display brightness of 150 cd/mÂ², the inefficient power consumption of the Sony smartphone prevents a very good result. Considering the nominal capacity of 2300 mAh of the lithium-polymer battery, the Xperia E5 should last considerably longer compared to the runtime of the LG K8 (2017). in light of the built-in hardware..

In the test: Sony Xperia E5. In our test, the Sony entry model scores with a high-contrast IPS HD panel and handiness. The Xperia E5 is well-built but only offers a plastic case that appears thin, although it feels okay. The competition that is made from glass ( UHANS S1 ) or metal ( Vernee Mars ) has a clearly higher-quality appearance.. and 1.5 GB RAM ensures a (surprisingly) fluid system performance in everyday life, and thanks to the relatively fast 16 GB eMMC storage, the apps open without too long load times. In addition, the GPS module of the Xperia E5 is very exact for its price class.. We comment negatively that due to the comparatively high power consumption and waste heat development, the runtimes of the Sony smartphone are below average compared to the competition. Moreover, the quality of the camera module and speaker are not very compelling.. The Xperia E5 is a solid everyday companion of the lower price segment. However, the fancy glass design of higher-priced Xperia smartphones typical for Sony would have benefited the entry device as a unique feature..

Unboxing, 360-degree spin, design and build quality 3. Sony Xperia E5 specification User opinions and reviews Review comments (80). 5.0" 1280 x 720px IPS LCD display of 294ppi. MediaTek MT6735 chipset: Quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A53; Mali-T720 GPU; 1.5GB RAM; 16 GB of built-in storage. 13 MP camera with 1080p@30fps video recording and tracking autofocus; 5 MP front-facing camera with 1080p@30fps video. LTE Cat.4 (150/50 Mbps); dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n; GPS/GLONASS/Beidou, Bluetooth v4.0. Active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic. The Sony Xperia E5 is the company's cheapest smartphone in the updated 2016 lineup, but you wouldn't tell going by just how it looks. The clean and classy design in fact reminds us of Sony's outgoing flagship, the Z5.. While the main focus has been on the X-series lately, often for the wrong reasons, the reshuffle at the top didn't obviously send ripples all the way down. It's business as usual in the E-series and the Xperia E5 clocks in at about the right time of the year to prove that the stuff that works needs no changes.. It's not to say though that the Xperia E5 didn't get any special attention. The upmarket design has one checkbox ticked but the specs are more than decent too for the phone's weight class and price bracket. Building on the previous generations, the Xperia E5 has all the traits of a well-rounded overall package.. Granted, there's no metal here - a feat only mid-rangers from China are clearly capable of pulling off. For Sony, it seems like a missed opportunity, considering that the battery isn't removable with the current plastic build anyway.. The battery size is adequate though and with Android 6.0 Marshmallow's optimizations should be able to do well enough.. Another interesting thing to see in action is the 13MP/5MP camera set-up front and rear - both are the highest res sensors to ever grace an E-series phone. Well, camera resolution is perhaps a cheap enough upgrade but Sony did well to keep the Xperia E5 on par with the competition.. But it's rare to see people driven by a specific feature or two in this price range; they want the full package. The Xperia E5 looks smart and professional and seems quite up to it overall. Time to look at it up close and have in-depth look of its performance.. Unboxing, 360-degree spin, design and build quality. Unboxing, 360-degree spin, design and build quality 3.

What You need is to create recovery.img to flash on /recovery partition (it should exist, as Sony started to adding them before E5). There are autotools for MTK devices (they create recovery for specific SoC/CPU not model), but I'm not sure if it is safe to flash on Sony firmware as it is different than generic firmware used on standard (Chinese) devices.

Realmente la bateria es muy mala, dura aproximadamente 13 horas pero con uso muy basico, apenas usando redes sociales en forma casual. Si se le da mas uso como ver videos, escuchar musica o utilizar otras aplicaciones, la bateria dura 8 horas o menos, sin mencionar que se sobrecalienta con TODAS las aplicaciones. La camara trasera saca fotos en su mayoria borrosas, cuesta mucho enfocar para tomar una foto a la altura de los 13MP que supuestamente trae.. Pesimo equipo, la peor compra que he hecho.. Mi sony xperia E5 no le coje la señal en cualquier parte ni en mi casa me coje xfa denme una respuesta xq es así me dijeron q estan saliendo con falla de fabrica la ante viene fallida pero quiero saber su respuesta. Con una aplicación de ahorrar batería se soluciona el problema de la batería buen equipo. La bateria no dura nada aunque no lo estes usando, LLEVO 2 EQUIPOS (me lo cambiaron) Y LOS DOS FALLARON DEL MICRÓFONO A LOS POCOS DIAS Y FUNCIONA DE NUEVO AL REINICIARLO. La cámara trasera no enfoca bien y salen borrosas las imágenes.. pues lo unico malo es que dura muy poco la carga las fotos son opacas y mas cuando hay poca luz y que no tiene concecion usb otg no detecta usb ya que es algo que no se le incorporo al celular. El Sony Xperia e5 es una reverenda porqueria, renove uno nuevo y dejo de cargar a los 3 dias, fui a Claro y nuevamente a los 3 dias se presento el mismo problema y hoy estoy yendo nuevamente ya he gastado 40 soles (12.26 dolares aprox) comprando protector de vidrio y carcasa y todo en vano, hasta mi Xperia E4 que ya lleva años conmigo me dura mas.. No entiendo tantas quejas, para empezar es un gama de entrada o gama media baja como le quieran decir, no se que esperan... Un S7? o un Xperia Z3,Z5? Yo llevo ya un par de semanas con el y la mitad de las quejas no las he tenido yo... La batería me dura lo justo, tampoco es que me mantenga pegado de el jugando y chateando todo el día, tal vez escuchando música y rara vez chateando, lo único a lo que si le tengo queja es a la vibración, es demasiado suave y yo siempre acostumbro a tenerlo en vibración, las llamadas se oyen bien, lo mismo que el parlante que esta abajo, no tengo quejas, a mi gusto se mueve muy fluido, tuve el LG G3 Beat en Lollipop y era un cáncer, y el LG es casi de las mismas prestaciones que este E5, salvo en la marca de procesador y que este posee mas RAM, en fin para mi gusto es un buen terminal y a mi me salió barato en una rebaja que había en el éxito en Colombia, ya que en los principales operadores supuestamente estaba descontinuado (pero aún así lo mostraban en el stock en la misma tienda). La capa de Sony siempre se ha caracterizado por ser lo menos engorrosa posible y es muy fluida, me recuerda la de Android stock y sus apps multimedia para mi son las mejores, en fin para mí buen movil en cuanto a calidad precio, sus fallas son la vibración y a veces la cámara y una lástima que al menos no hubiese llegado a Android 7, feliz tarde..

For someone that has fought against going to an I-Phone versus a Samsung Black Jack because of their complexities. I am very very pleased with this little Android phone that I purchased last week. Amazingly easy set up, and very easy to use. Also, being an Amazon Prime customer since it's inception, this is one of the best products that I have ordered. Keep up the good work Amazon.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Horrible phone.....not worth the price.... Extremely slow, I literally have to press on a letter then wait like 5 seconds before the letter appears on the screen....imagine how long it takes to type a sentence with five words...smh. Display is horrible...when you just turn on the phone the graphics that appear look great...nice, clear and crisp...but when the icons load they all look fuzzy..far from looking clear and crisp. The phone does not have much internal storage...download a few updates and you can't even download a small game on the phone. I deeply regret buying this phone. used it for only two weeks and packed it away.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars This is nice cellphone for not snobs people. One of the things I like about this cellphone is price/quality ration. It offers many good features for a relatively low price. On the other hand, I like the sophisticated appearance of this device, it is sober and simple but shows a nice style at the same time. It does not have a great storage capacity (2 GB) but you are able to increase the memory with a Micro sim memory, which is not really expensive. For, me it is fast enough, altough it may not be fast enough for people that like to have many applications ON at the same time, if you only need about 4 "big" applications on, like facebook, twitter, wassapp and gmail, it would work well.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent for the price.. This phone is not the best I have seen but when you consider the price it is the best Android phone compatible with AT&T 3G network and unlocked. Many cheap GSM phones do not support the frequencies used by AT$T. It is elegant looking with nice feel to it. Call quality (even in poor service areas) is excellent. Good speaker, OK screen, OK camera, great battery life. Not the fastest but I suspect it is more than enough for the average user. I tested data speed while tethering this phone to a PC and it clocks at 3.6mbs. That is almost the same as my Samsung 4G that cost 4 times more. The Bluetooth works much better than other phones I have had with great sound through my car stereo. I have been using it for a while now streaming internet radio while driving and that also works really well. Just buy it, you will love it if you don't expect it to work like a $400 phone.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Performance so poor that it is basically UNUSABLE.. I bought this as a spare smartphone. I have to admit that the phone looks sharp, but the extremely poor performance makes it unusable. I have used many smartphones and this is BY FAR THE SLOWEST SMARTPHONE I HAVE EVER USED. When using most apps the phone "spins" a long time before even displaying the screen completely. Keystrokes sometimes takes a while to register. Images sent via whatsapp take several seconds to display. Images being downloaded by online apps take several seconds to display. It is obvious that the amount of memory on the phone is woefully inadequate to run the software that it uses. The phone can be used only for basic purposes like calling and texting, but then you don't need a smartphone to do those things. This is an outdated device that is not well equipped to run the latest software/apps. It is IRRESPONSIBLE FOR SELLERS TO KEEP OFFERING IT. I will probably give this to someone who needs a basic phone.. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars It does take nice pictures in the day or with lots of light. I bought this phone last winter. It has survived numerous drops, even though it is small and not too thick (I bought a case for it on Amazon a few month ago though). I use this phone mainly for leisure purposes. You can install most of the apps from Google Play. It only has a 3.2 MP camera, so don't expect to take spectacular photos. It does take nice pictures in the day or with lots of light. My main issues: If you don't close out unused apps, the phone slows down significantly. It can just be one other app and it starts to crawl. On two different occasions, the phone erased my songs and pictures. They were sent to lost.dir and I had to manually rename each picture and song on my computer and then put them back on the phone. Some of the pictures were damaged and were permanently lost. The headphones that came with the phone didn't last long. I've tried several headphones, but the phone doesn't recognize most of them. If it wasn't for the phone surviving drops without cracking, I would have gave it a much lower rating.. Was this review helpful to you?. Not happy at all with the purchase. It is too small then I expected.. 1.0 out of 5 stars One Star. I did not like it at all. I didn't feel it's a strong phone.. 1.0 out of 5 stars One Star. It was a great buy for that price... 4.0 out of 5 stars nice price... Did not work outside of the US as advertised. 1.0 out of 5 stars Did not work outside of the US. 3.0 out of 5 stars Three Stars. Love the size of the phone, fits everywhere. Key pad is small, but once you get used to it, its fine.. 4.0 out of 5 stars Love the size of the phone. 5.0 out of 5 stars Old one bat good for me.. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. My daughter loves the phone but I didn't work she was upset and said your first phone. 1.0 out of 5 stars One Star.

Sony Xperia E5 vs Samsung Galaxy J7 2016: Is The New Galaxy Phone The Best Buy Option?. Sony Xperia E5 , Samsung Galaxy J7 2016 , Specs and features , comaprison specs. 6 August 2016, 7:50 am EDT. By Dheeraj R Mobile & Apps. Our Sony Xperia E5 and Samsung Galaxy J7 2016 comparison hinted that the new Galaxy phone stands out to be the better phone in terms of specs, like a 5.5-inch display and Snapdragon processor.. To start with, the Samsung Galaxy J7 2016 phone sports a 5.5-inch screen with Super AMOLED display. On the other hand, the Sony Xperia E5 only has a 5-inch screen with IPS display. Both the phones offer 720 x 1280 pixels resolution.. In terms of performance-related specs, the Galaxy phone outshines the Sony device with the help of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 or Exynos 7870 Octa processor, depending on its variants along with 2 GB RAM. The Xperia E5 has a Mediatek MT6735 chipset packed with 1.5 GB RAM, which is more basic in nature.. Furthermore, the two devices sport the same 16 GB storage expandable up to 256 GB via a micro SD slot. As far as the camera is concerned, both the smartphones again feature similar specs with a 13-megapixel rear and a 5-megapixel front camera along with same additional features like the autofocus and LED flash.. Both the Samsung and Sony Xperia phones run on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow OS and thus the same applications like Android Pay and customized Google tabs.. For the battery life, the Sony Xperia E5 sports non-removable Li-Ion 2700 mAh battery, which provides you with almost 24 hours of usage just with a single charge. Whereas the Samsung Galaxy phone consists of a huge removable Li-Ion 3300 mAh battery, which provides up to 23 hours of device life even with 3G usage.. To sum up, the Sony Xperia E5 is surely one of the most affordable Xperia phones available currently with a solid design, average performance, and battery life. But compared to the Samsung Galaxy J7 2016, it fails to make a mark on the users. Choosing between the two will depend on your budget and specs requirements.. ©2018Mobile & Apps, All rights reserved.
