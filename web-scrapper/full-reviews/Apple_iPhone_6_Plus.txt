The Good The big battery provides long life, and the 5.5-inch screen is not only big but bright and high-contrast. Optical image stabilization improves low-light photography.. The Bad The big footprint may not be for everybody, and the overall design is less distinctive than previous iPhones.. The Bottom Line The iPhone 6 Plus is an outstanding choice for those with big budgets and big pockets, but power users seeking even more flexibility should audition the Galaxy Note 4 as well.. Editors' note: On September 7, 2016, Apple debuted the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus , and discontinued the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus remain available, however, and Apple has increased the storage capacity of the entry-level models to 32GB and lowered prices to $549 and $649, respectively. The full iPhone 6 Plus review, first published in September 2014 and updated in June 2015, follows.. In 2014, Apple forked its iPhone product line, simultaneously introducing the next generation of its flagship model -- the iPhone 6 -- and debuting its super-sized sibling, the iPhone 6 Plus. The iPhone 6 is an exceptional phone in nearly every way but for its middling battery life. The iPhone 6 Plus is also impressive; larger and thinner than other iPhone models, and with the capacity for far more endurance on a single charge than most comparably-sized and smaller competitors.. As great a phone as it is, the iPhone 6 Plus isn't for everybody. Its defining characteristic is its size, which occupies a nice middle ground between the 4-inch. iPhone 5S and the 7.9-inch iPad Mini. While the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 is considerably more portable, the 6 Plus will hit the sweet spot for those who want a bigger display on their smartphone (and prefer iOS to Android).. And remember: a 5.5-inch screen may feel gigantic at first, but it may end up. feeling just right in no time.. Befitting its moniker, the 6 Plus is on the large side, measuring 6.22 inches high by 3.06 inches wide (158mm by 78mm). At 6.07 ounces (172 grams) it's just a touch lighter than the. Samsung Galaxy Note 4 but noticeably thinner -- just 7.1mm in thickness, compared with the Note 4's 8.5mm.. US base price (with 2-year agreement). 5.5-inch Quad HD 2,560x1,440 IPS (538 ppi). 5.7-inch 2,560x1,440 Super AMOLED (515 ppi). Dimensions aside, the iPhone 6 Plus feels better in the hand than the Note. Like previous iPhones, it's made of matte aluminum, but where harsh lines and chamfered edges give the iPhone 5 a stark, industrial feel, the iPhone 6 Plus nestles more comfortably in your hand rather than cutting into it.. That noted, the rounded shape -- complete with glass that blends into the rounded edges -- provides a less distinctive appearance. That curved glass will be familiar to owners of Nokia Lumia devices, and the inset lines of plastic on the back are reminiscent of the. Though the iPhone 6 Plus looks and feels great, it lacks the unique styling of its predecessor.. Owners of earlier model iPhones will need to adjust to different button locations; the iPhone 6 Plus's power/lock button is located on the right side - a good thing, given how far one would need to reach if it were placed on the top. The volume buttons, wide and flat rather than round, are located on the left directly beneath the ring/silent toggle switch. The 3.5mm headphone jack sits at the bottom, as it does with the 5S, next to eight holes that allow sound from the (surprisingly powerful) internal speaker to escape.. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus face off against the competition (pictures). Then, of course, there's the home button, front and center below the display, featuring Touch ID functionality, which allows you to unlock the phone quickly with a fingerprint. While this feature is no longer as novel as it was when it debuted, Touch ID remains quicker and more reliable than the fingerprint detection capabilities we've seen on other smartphones. And with iOS 8, you can use fingerprint access for a wide variety of apps beyond the lock screen and iTunes Store.. To avoid any unfortunate thumb-straining incidents, Apple provides the "Reachability" feature: two quick taps on the Home button slide any content at the top of the display -- app icons, Safari 's URL bar, whatever else is up there -- down to the bottom. tap rather than a double press -- the latter of which opens up the app switching screen, as it does on earlier versions of iOS.) Though it's handy in theory, we did not find it particularly useful in practice.. For example, if you want to open a folder of icons on the top of the display, a double-tap brings that folder down. Tap on the folder and it opens, but then slides back up to the top again. You need to double-tap on the Home button again to bring it down a second time so that you can select an icon within. It's simply too much tapping to be of regular use, even for those with short thumbs, though it could be handy if you're standing on a bus or train and need your other hand to hang on.. Another software tweak exclusive to the Plus is a special layout for some apps when the phone is held sideways in landscape mode. Mail and Messages give you an iPad-like view, with a list of messages on the left and their content on the right.. The size of your hands, and your ability to reach the corners of the device, will play a large part in determining whether the 6 Plus is a good fit for you. Another deciding factor will be whether it fits into your pockets. Unless your pants are of the cargo variety, you're probably going to want the iPhone 6 Plus in a back pocket when you're out and about.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition....

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Dual-core, 1400 MHz, Cyclone ARMv8-A 2nd gen., 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Stand-by time: 16.0 days (384 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 24.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Apple's latest smartphone, the iPhone 6 Plus, is the phone many have waited for.. The iPhone 6 Plus touts a much bigger screen and slimmer profile than its predecessor. The smartphone has a thickness of 7.1 mm, making it easily slip in the tightest of places. The biggest difference in the design of the iPhone 6 Plus is it's 5.5 inch screen. In the past, Apple has strayed from creating bigger phones. However, with bigger phones becoming the norm, the company has designed a product that will truly fit in with its competition.. Additionally, the iPhone 6 Plus improves upon familiar design features. Slimmer volume buttons, silencing switch, and sleep button accompany the slender profile. The durable sapphire glass curves at the edges, providing a smooth and seamless appearance. As always, Apple is offering the iPhone 6 Plus in gold, silver, and space gray.. The iPhone 6 Plus's change in appearance isn't a huge leap. It's been speculated for years that Apple would produce a larger iPhone. While many discourage the change in size, it provides a better platform to view media, which is what Apple excels in. Apple has been adamant about it's small profile for years. With the increase in size of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, Apple doesn't seem to be looking back. While men will have no problem adjusting to the change due to larger hands, women may have a more difficult time. While it doesn't seem like a huge difference, every user will most likely need to adjust their muscle memory to adapt to the larger screen.. This smartphone has an amazing HD Retina display. While many expected the iPhone 6 Plus to be a blown up version of the iPhone 6, Apple has made a new display for this device alone. This display has a higher pixel density at 1920 x 1080. Its 401 PPI resolution will provide a crisp image. Apple has also done a lot in terms of contrast. This device has much higher contrast with better white balance and brightness, allowing the phone to be used in any lighting condition.. To compensate for the bigger screen, Apple has implemented a number of newer features specifically for the iPhone 6 Plus. Those with bigger phones often find it difficult to maneuver the phone with one hand. This smartphone has a new feature called Reachability. This will move content closer to the thumb with a double tap of the home button. Furthermore, swiping gestures have been improved. Certain apps like Mail and Safari include gestures to make maneuvering easier. Apple has done great things to make the transition to a bigger screen easier for current iPhone users.. The new screen resolution and size will be great for viewing videos and pictures. The Retina display has been a huge selling point for Apple since its inception. The new iPhone 6 Plus screen is no different. Instead of squinting to view media like users have had to do in the past, they can now have enough screen real estate to fill all their entertainment needs.. Apple has improved overall on the internal aspects of the new device. It has a new A8 processor, making the iPhone 6 Plus the fastest model yet. One of the biggest advantages to the iPhone 6 Plus over the normal iPhone 6 is its increased battery life. It's increase in size has allowed for a larger battery. It offers up to 384 hours of standby time with 24 hours of talk time on 3G.. There has been a lot of complaints in the past concerning battery life. The iPhone 5 had significant issues, with batteries getting weak quite quickly. It's good to see an improvement on the battery life. Many may choose to pick up the device for the battery power alone, despite its size increase. iPhones are meant to be media-centric devices. While that's a great thing for people who want to enjoy their media on the go, it's often halted due to battery limitations. With the new iPhone 6 Plus, users should have ample battery life to last them throughout the day. However, only time will tell if there will be issues similar to that of the iPhone 5.. The camera on the iPhone 6 Plus is equipped with an 8 MP camera. The iSight camera has 1.5 micron pixels for clear FaceTime and social media ready selfies. Video capture has also seen a significant improvement. This smartphone is now capable of 1080 HD at 60 fps. Additionally, the iPhone 6 Plus is capable of taking slow motion time elapse video at 240 fps.. The difference between the camera on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus is the latter's use of optical image stabilization. Apple has thought of a great way to make up for the slightly awkward size difference in this model, stabilizing shakiness to produce a crisp image. Mobile phones have become the go-to camera. iPhone cameras in particular are one of the most popular cameras in the world. While the changes in the camera are not unprecedented, they do provide iPhone users with a slew of new possibilities.. Since the release of the iPhone 5, many have been speculating that Apple would include some sort of NFC payment capability. With the iPhone 6 Plus, this feature is finally implemented with Apple Pay. Apple pay is basically a digital wallet. Users can store their credit and debit cards on the device to pay at a number of different stores. They'll simply pass their phone across the NFC reader to start the payment. Instead of signing or asking for identification, Apple Pay will use the Touch ID technology to accept payment.. While it may seem daunting at first to store credit card information on the phone, Apple has implemented a number of safety features. The actual numbers aren't stored on the phone or on Apple servers. In fact, the merchant doesn't even get the number upon paying for a purchase. Instead, they receive a custom ID number that corresponds with that purchase. If the phone is stolen, users can remotely turn the Apple Pay feature off, rejecting any payments made without authorization.. This feature can either be a huge hit, or a major flop. On one hand, it's a great method for making purchases. It saves time and allows users to keep everything they need in one place with no need for a wallet. On the other hand, many people could be turned off because of fear that their data will be stolen. While Apple has ensured users that their data is safe, that usually isn't enough to sway users. With the recent "hacking" of Apple's iCloud, many people are weary. However Apple's safety protocols seem to make it a viable payment method.. Overall, the iPhone 6 Plus is a great smartphone. It has improved on Apple's innovative features while adding numerous more. It is a product that millions have been waiting on for years. While the larger screen size may be a deterrent for many current iPhone users, the numerous added benefits will make it a popular phone. It's not just a tweaked version of the iPhone 6, but rather a great phone all in itself. With this addition to its collection, Apple has created a large screen phone that can fairly go against any competitor.. Get $100 off iPhone 7 or 7 Plus. Get $100 off iPhone 8 or 8 Plus.

CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The iPhone 6 delivers a spacious, crisp 4.7-inch screen, improved wireless speeds, better camera autofocus, and bumped-up storage capacities to 128GB at the top end. iOS remains a top-notch mobile operating system with an excellent ecosystem of apps, and Apple Pay is a smooth, secure payment system.. The Bad Battery life isn't much better than it is on last year's iPhone 5S. And there's wasted space: an even larger screen could have been squeezed into the same housing.. The Bottom Line The iPhone 6 is an exceptional phone in nearly every way except its average battery life: it's thin, fast, and features the excellent iOS operating system. It was the best overall phone introduced in 2014.. The 2013 Moto X (left), iPhone 6 (center), Nexus 5 (right). The screen A handy comparison of all iOS screen sizes: 4S, 5S, 6, 6 Plus, iPad Mini, iPad Air. Performance: Faster still 3DMark Ice Storm -- Unlimited. Editors' note: On September 7, 2016, Apple debuted the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus , and discontinued the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus remain available, however, and Apple has increased the storage capacity of the entry-level models to 32GB and lowered their prices to $549 and $649, respectively. The full iPhone 6 review, first published in September 2014, updated to include a CNET Editor's Choice designation in November 2014, and then updated in Summer 2015, follows.. In 2014, Apple forked its iPhone product line, simultaneously introducing the next generation of its flagship model -- the iPhone 6 -- and debuting its super-sized sibling, the iPhone 6 Plus. The iPhone 6 is an exceptional phone in nearly every way but for its middling battery life. The iPhone 6 Plus is also impressive; larger and thinner than other iPhone models, and with the capacity for far more endurance on a single charge than most comparably-sized and smaller competitors.. When choosing between the 6 and 6 Plus, in the end, it's a matter of personal preference. I know several people who love the iPhone 6 Plus, with its larger screen size and better battery life. But the iPhone 6 feels best in my hand. It's thin, elegant, performs really well, and is considerably less expensive than the 6 Plus. For that reason, I think the smaller iPhone 6 is the way to go for most people.. The iPhone 6's thin, all-metal aesthetic makes for one of the sleekest designs in the smartphone universe. This iPhone is only slightly thinner than the previous model but feels more so; this is due to the increased screen size and curved design. Glass from the front folds ever so slightly around the edges -- a departure from the sharp industrial edges of the iPhone 5 and 5S. It also feels a little like the. original iPhone , which had a rounded design. But that phone was chunkier, with a far smaller screen. It felt like holding a pebble. The iPhone 6 is flat and thin, like a slab.. The iPhone 6 feels good to hold, beautifully solid, with a smooth, metal back and glass front. But it has an aura of fragility -- maybe it's the extra-slim look, or the massive pane of curved glass on the front. I instantly wanted to slip it into a case just to be safe. Early reports of bending iPhones may have been overblown. Consumer Reports' testing found that the new iPhones can withstand less pressure than the iPhone 5, LG G3 and Samsung Galaxy Note 3 , but are about as equally durable as the HTC One M8. In other words, it's not exactly delicate, but, like any other phone, it can be damaged -- so handle with care, and get a case for it .. Best iPhone 6 cases and iPhone 6S cases. The camera lens on the back of the iPhone 6 protrudes slightly, which made me worry about setting the phone down on rough surfaces, despite the fortitude of the sapphire lens. Again: using a case will alleviate any concerns.. The volume buttons, which were round and raised on previous iPhones, are elongated on the 6, similar to those on the iPod Touch and iPad. The power/sleep button has shifted to the right, making it easier to find in my experience.. A round Touch ID home button is located underneath the display; a simple press on the fingerprint reader unlocks the phone, and works amazingly well most of the time. While this feature is no longer as novel as it was when it debuted, Touch ID remains quicker and more reliable than the fingerprint detection capabilities we've seen on other smartphones. And with iOS 8, you can use fingerprint access for a wide variety of apps beyond the lock screen and iTunes Store.. If I have one problem with the new design, it's the bezel around the display. It's still big -- bigger than that of most Android phones, which means that the iPhone 6, with its 4.7-inch screen, is the same size as other phones with 5-inch screens. For example, the iPhone 6 runs as tall and wide the. Nexus 5 , which has a larger 5-inch screen; it's also larger than the 2013 Moto X, which fits a comparable 4.7-inch display into a more compact body. (Both the old Moto X and Nexus 5 are thicker, however.) The iPhone 6 measures 5.4 by 2.6 inches, and 0.3 inch thick (138 by 67 by 69mm). It weighs 4.5 ounces, or 128 grams.. Though the iPhone 6 is basically one-hand friendly (and certainly more so than the iPhone 6 Plus), it comes with a useful but weird software feature called. Reachability that pulls the top half of the display down to midscreen with a light double-tap of the Home button, for easier thumb access.. iPhones have always had phenomenal displays, both in terms of brightness and color quality. CNET's battery of tests , we found that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus's screens are even better than those on previous iPhones, with superior grayscale and contrast levels.. Though phones with OLED displays , like the Samsung Galaxy S5 , deliver more vivid contrast and slightly richer, if less accurate, color, the iPhone 6's 4.7-inch. IPS display is excellent: vivid and rich. The display's 1,344x750-pixel resolution is higher than the fifth generation's 1,136x640, but it has the same 326ppi pixel density. A grid of six-by-four apps now fits on each page plus the four in the dock below, for 28 total; on the 5's 4-inch display, it's 24. There are more pixels horizontally and vertically, unlike the merely vertical lengthening of the iPhone 5. That also means the aspect ratio is the same (16x9), and videos and Web pages scale similarly.. Native apps look fantastic and nonoptimized apps scale up well, too: games and streaming video services designed for a smaller display still fill the screen and have crisp text. I still think many people will find this 4.7-inch screen to find the right balance between functionality and portability. That noted, the iPhone 6's screen resolution is a step below ideal.. The iPhone 6 is among the fastest phones around. It comes equipped with the A8 64-bit dual-core processor, which Apple claims delivers a 25 percent boost in speed and a 50 percent graphics boost over the iPhone 5S; this claim was confirmed in both our benchmark tests (see below) and hands-on testing. Navigating the UI and launching apps is zippy, and the phone runs nearly all tasks at a silky-smooth clip.. Apple's Metal coding tool helps some iOS games perform even better than the benchmarks suggest. Games that have been iPhone 6-optimized look great and load and run quickly, but the difference isn't as dramatic as you might expect. (Read about Apple's Metal-related announcements from its Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2015.). In frames per second; longer bars indicate better performance.

For a more in-depth look at the technology in both phones, check out our more robust iPhone 6 review .. Apple’s largest iPhone, the iPhone 6 Plus, has unusual, almost hypnotic powers.. I’ve witnessed people who are initially confounded, even repulsed, by the 5.5-inch phablet. But then they hold it and play with it for awhile and proclaim this is the iPhone for them. Perhaps that’s why Apple chose to build an iPhone that’s almost too big for a pocket, but, as one woman told me, would fit quite nicely in a clutch.. There are so many similarities between the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus that this review will focus primarily on the key differences, the benefits you get from owning an iPhone 6 Plus and the design and software choices Apple made to maintain usability and, more importantly, "reachability.". At 6.22 inches tall by 3 inches wide, the iPhone 6 Plus lives up to its plus-sized name. For the sake of comparison, the iPhone 6 is 5.44 x 2.64 inches, respectively (the iPhone 5S is a puny in comparison at 4.75 x 2.25 inches). At 6.07 ounces, the iPhone 6 Plus significantly outweighs the 4.55-ounce iPhone 6. Despite its extra heft, the larger iPhone is just 0.2 millimeters thicker than the iPhone 6.. Other than size and price (the iPhone 6 Plus starts at $299 for a 16GB model), the iPhone 6 Plus closely follows the design language of the iPhone 6, right down to the slightly protruding iSight camera.. With its size and weight, the iPhone 6 Plus feels more like a mini tablet than a phone and easily fills one of my pockets. I prefer the smaller smartphone, but based on recent pre-order reports, I may be in the minority.. "The iPhone 6 Plus has unusual, almost hypnotic powers.". With the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus being so similar (with the exception of OIS and some widescreen extras), the choice comes down to size, and that’s a very personal choice.. If you want a phablet, the iPhone 6 Plus is a very good one. That big screen is especially well suited to movie watching and game playing, but also packs in a lot more info from web pages and emails than you’ll get from the iPhone 6, 5S and other, smaller smartphones.. To be honest, I can see why, even with the heftier price tag, the iPhone 6 Plus is so alluring, but no, I won’t be carrying that giant device in my pocket or feeling its slightly hefty body tottering in my hand. When I hold the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 in my hand, I can easily reach to the far corner of the screen with my thumb. Not so with the iPhone 6 Plus. I either have to use two hands, find a way to stretch my thumb or, better yet, use Apple’s new Reachability feature, which is available in iOS 8 and therefore in both phones, to reach screen elements that might otherwise be out of reach.. I double-tap on the home button and the screen drops down halfway to put previously out-of-reach interface elements within reach. It’s a reasonable solution, though some people I showed it to called it clunky.. The iPhone 6 Plus’s larger screen, though, is not something to simply manage. The Retina HD screen is 1,920 x 1,080 pixels, full HD. At 401 pixels per inch, it offers considerably more information on screen than the iPhone 5S and even the iPhone 6 (both are at 326 ppi). Not only does this make everything on screen look spectacular, but it lets Apple add a collection of useful big-screen functions to the iPhone 6 Plus.. The home screen, for example, offers a landscape view that puts the persistent menu items (mail, Safari and iTunes) in a vertical bar on the right. Try turning your current iPhone sideways and see how mail looks. You get a list of emails, but no inbox view.. With the iPhone 6 Plus, the landscape email view offers an inbox list on the left and open email on the right — the same view you see on the iPad. With iOS 8’s new swipe-left-to-delete action, this is one of the best ways of scanning and acting on email. I wish Apple would implement the horizontal email view option on the iPhone 6, as well.. If everything looks a bit small on the giant screen, you can choose Display Zoom in settings, which makes everything slightly larger. It worked fine, but I preferred the standard display setting.. Editor's Note: Read more about the camera technology in our iPhone 6 review .. The iPhone 6 Plus iSight camera is virtually the same as the one on the iPhone 6, but with one crucial difference: The larger smartphone gets optical image stabilization (or OIS), which means the lens can float from side-to-side as you jostle around, creating crisper photos and smoother HD video.. Since both the iPhone 6 and 6 plus have strong continuous autofocus, faster exposure correction (thanks to Focus Pixels), images and video from both cameras looks great. In fact, I was having a hard time seeing the benefit of OIS on the iPhone 6 Plus. Then a small fire broke out on the roof of the building across the street from Mashable HQ.. I grabbed the iPhone 6 Plus and started shooting slow-motion video at 240 frames per second. As I zoomed in, I grew concerned that the video would look like a mess. I watched on the Plus's screen as the flames licked up the side of a small structure atop the building and then as firefighters arrived on scene to douse the blaze into submission (no injuries and minimal damage). Afterward, I watched the slo-mo playback of the scene. The video was clear, smooth and dramatic — a little like a scene from Ron Howard’s Backdraft.. The video below shows a few other examples of the slo-mo feature on the camera.. "I won’t be carrying that giant device in my pocket ... Like the iPhone 6, Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus runs on the new A8 chip (ARM-based, 1.39GHz). It scored virtually the same Geekbench 3 (1,599 for single-core and 2,876 for multi-core). It ran all apps like a champ and was arguably the better iPhone 6 for Bioshock, owing mainly to the larger and slightly higher-resolution screen.. Both iPhone 6 phones have better LTE and Wi-Fi (802.11ac) radios than the iPhone 5S. On the LTE side, I was testing a Verizon model and my mobile broadband experience was dictated by the quality of the signal and the saturation of nearby connections. Which is to say, it was hard to notice much of a difference. Strong LTE signals provide a good browsing and even video-streaming experience, but those are becoming harder and harder to find.. The iPhone 6 Plus has the biggest battery of all iPhones and, as a result, Apple rates it for a couple more hours of talk time, video streaming, music playback and standby time. In my limited battery tests, I got a solid day (12 hours) of mixed use.. Big screen shows lots of info • Movies and games look amazing. Big and heavy, it’s almost a tablet • Costs $100 more than the excellent iPhone 6 • More expensive than other phablets. If you must have a phablet, the Apple iPhone 6 Plus is a powerful and attractive choice..

Adorama pays top dollar for your used gear .. B&H Photo - Video - Pro Audio. The iPhone 6 Plus is extraordinary. It's like having a supercomputer and HDTV in your pocket.. The Camera is fantastic in almost any light, and the slo-mo and time-lapse video for the first time make it trivially easy to make these shots. Video stabilization is so good you really can shoot while walking and have the video come out perfectly stable!. Audio performance has also been greatly upgraded from previous iPhones, which were all pretty good to begin with. Today, the iPhone 6 Plus' direct analog audio output is better than many specialized portable audiophile DACs like the Beyerdynamic A200p which I lab-tested at the same time I tested the iPhone 6 Plus. The iPhone 6 Plus' audio output is now as good or better than most dedicated outboard DACs.. Because the iPhone 6 Plus screen is so big, I can leave my iPad at home and watch movies on the iPhone screen instead. I travel as light as possible, and with my iPhone 6 Plus, the iPad isn't needed.. It's so powerful that it replaces my MacBook Pro for most things, too, when traveling. The iPhone 6 Plus has so much computing power that it slams through everything super-fast.. Also terrific about the 6 Plus is that it comes in a 128 GB version.

No way was I going to crawl around down there and try peering at a tiny DSLR LCD in Live View or use a right-angle finder when all I had to do was reach down a little with my iPhone and look at its huge screen.

Sure, a Canon Powershot has a broader zoom range and more features, but since I'm already packing my Nikon , who cares? For 90% of shots, the fixed lens of the iPhone 6 Plus is sharper than zooms, and has the focal length I need.. I use the iPhone 6 Plus along with my DSLR to shoot better video; it has superb image stabilization so I can walk around and get rail-steady video.. Of course the iPhone shots have fantastic colors, as good as Nikon and Canon and better than Fuji, LEICA or Sony. (Fuji is great for people, but no mirrorless is as good as Nikon or Canon for everything else), and they are super-sharp. As we expect, iPhone exposure is always right on, with a better hit-rate than a DSLR.. You mean the iPhone has autofocus?. I never noticed; it focuses at least as fast as my own eyes. Much better then older iPhones, always gets perfect focus.. Vacancy, Bridgeport, California, 20 October 2014 , 6:39 PM.

I can shoot outdoors at night with no flash and get swell pictures, while my iPhone 5S just got black screens. The range of light over which we can shoot the iPhone 6 Plus has been significantly extended into darkness.. New also in the iPhone 6 Plus is optical image stabilization, and it really works. It's nearly impossible to get a blurred photo. Even when the live preview seems to imply it will be out of focus or blurred, the actual image is always spot-on..

We've all been able to do this on a computer in the past, but it was too much work. I made this shot simply by turning on the iPhone 6 Plus and resting it on a bumper; the jumping is me repositioning it while I was rolling.. This is a low-resolution emailed file. The original files are of course HD.. Not only is the 6 Plus camera extraordinary, I can do anything with the photos right from the iPhone, while I can't do anything with Powershot or Nikon photos until they are transferred to a computer — or the iPhone.. Some people want prints from my photos right away, and lo and behold, with the Costco app I can send images to print at the Costco right near me. As soon as I get there, they're ready — or I can cause the prints to be mailed to my client right from the app.. Not only can I print photos I just shot, they are real photo prints that look fantastic and will never fade like Polaroids or ink jet prints. Just as easily as printing what I just shot on the iPhone, I was able to print any of the images I stored on the iPhone that I synced from galleries in my Mac. In other words, I could print on demand, and with the huge storage in the iPhone 6 Plus, had much of my archive in my pocket for instant printing.. These measurements are made with an exotic Rohde & Schwarz UPL laboratory analyzer. The traces from the Rohde & Schwarz UPL laboratory analyzer are color coded for the Left Channel and for the Right Channel. When they don't lie on top of each other, it's due to channel imbalance. When they do lie on top of each other, the trace turns blue.. Unless otherwise specified, all measurements are RMS at 1 kHz into 200 kΩ.. 1.0145 V (0.125 dBV) @ 0.002 % THD. 1.008 V (0.07 dBV) @ 0.002 % THD. 1.001 V (0.009 dBV) @ 0.002 % THD. 0.920 V (-0.724 dBV) @ 0.0025 % THD. This is great; unlike many other headphone amplifiers with larger output impedance, this low 3.18Ω output impedance will minimize low-frequency distortion and frequency response variations when used with real headphones.. About 3.5 dB/click; the side buttons move the gain slider in 16 steps:. While the buttons move in steps of about 3.5 dB, the finger slider has more range, as well as very precise settings available to the nimble-fingered.. If you slide your finger, it moves in 0.5 dB steps and maximum attenuation is -77.22 dB before muting.. Once you've slide the volume to a random position, the volume buttons raise and lower the gain from that selected gain, not the gains listed above referenced to the top 0 dB setting.. The right channel is about 0.0002 dB lower than the left, at maximum gain.. Few labs even have the ability to measure differences this slight.. The channels track to within about a hundredth of a dB or better as the volume is changed, as expected for an electronic attenuator..

Perfect, it's got even less distortion at -20 dBFS where it counts. Are we sure there aren't some Nuvistors or a 12AX7 in there?. Let's keep dropping the recorded level:. Analog output harmonic content, undithered 1kHz sine wave at -40 dBFS. (CBS CD-1 track 18, R&S UPL .). Analog output harmonic content, undithered 1kHz sine wave at -50 dBFS. (CBS CD-1 track 18, R&S UPL .). Fantastic, this THD is completely inaudible, even at -50 dBFS.. Let's see a zoomed FFT of a 10 kHz sine wave. Let's see what sort of spurs surround the carrier, which show us internal jitter:. Zoomed spectrum of 10,007 Hz 0 dBFS sine wave. (CBS CD-1 track 9, R&S UPL .). This is FANTASTIC! This is significantly better than previous iPhones, and better than many audiophile DACs , and almost as good as a professional reference DAC like the Benchmark DAC1 HDR .. Spectrum of 10,007 Hz 0 dBFS sine wave. (CBS CD-1 track 9, R&S UPL .). Let's see how 11+12 kHz IMD look:. IMD spectrum at 11 kHz and 12 kHz 1:1. (CBS CD-1 track 13, index 2, R&S UPL .). Spectrum of 1,002.27 Hz 0 dBFS square wave. (CBS CD-1 track 16, R&S UPL .). This is very good, way better than Bluetooth and better than most outboard DACS.. The iPhone 6 Plus won't distort or do anything crazy when playing modern CDs that are recorded at 110%.. The 500Hz dithered fade-to-noise test (track 20 on the CBS CD-1 test CD) sounds great out to at least 26 seconds, or -112 dBFS. Not bad for a 16-bit system!. It's big battery does more than power the huge screen. Because it's so big, the battery powers through power-sucking game and navigation apps with ease, having far more power left at the end of the day than smaller iPhones trying to run the same apps.. The big battery in the iPhone 6 Plus lasts a long time, especially when using power-hog apps like Google Maps. The 6 Plus battery is big enough to light the big screen, while power-hungry apps don't draw any more power in the 6 Plus than they do on smaller devices. Thus the extra capacity goes a very long way so we can use these apps freely without having to charge during the day. If I use my 6 Plus hard all day on a day off, I still have 35% left every night.. The big battery can take longer to charge, if you use the same iPhone charger that comes with it and every iPhone. Here's a tip: I use the larger iPad charger , and my 6 Plus charges in an hour. I suppose if it was completely dead it might take 2 hours to hit 100%, but since charges at about 1% per minute from an iPad charger it goes from 35% to 90% in an hour.. No matter how hard I hit it, I can use it all day and still have at least 35% left at the end of each day. Even with hard use I usually have 50% left.. I flew from NYC to California for my Yosemite workshops , so most of what I did was watch movies and enjoy music the whole day on the plane.. After about 3 hours of music, a bit of the usual online eMail, messages and some phone calls before and after the flight — and after 4 and a half hours of watching movies on the plane — I still had 55% charge. I only used from 90% down to 60% on the plane for four and a half hours of movies and probably an hour of music. The flight had no restrictions on iPad etc. use so long as there was no cell usage, so I had music and movies playing for the entire flight cross-continent.. With the remote control of my Beyer T51i headphones, the iPhone sat in my pocket as I schlepped everything around airports and airplanes, and had music on call. I love getting to the airport an hour or two early so I can relax and enjoy my music.. In airplane mode, the iPhone 6 Plus runs longer than my iPad, which runs 10 hours on a charge. As I calculated it, I'd probably get 13 hours of movie playback on the iPhone 6 Plus!. I didn't even bother to find my charger when I got to California. I woke up the next day and still had 55% charge!. I'm digging the iPhone 6 Plus. Like all cell phones, I usually can't understand anything over cell phone calls. Audio is usually garbled, dull and awful since cell companies limit the call's audio frequency response to about 3 kHz and then throw away most of the audio data as part of the very lossy data compression used to cram your call over as little bandwidth as possible, typically 16 kb/s.. Here's a hint: use FaceTime audio!. FaceTime audio is fantastic: it's full-bandwidth and sounds like you're right there. It's 100% clear and I can hear everything!. FaceTime audio and regular FaceTime video also use very little data, so I don't see any extra cellular data usage. If you want to be able to talk on the phone as clearly as if you are in the room with someone, try FaceTime audio.. With Apple, I have far more than a stand-alone phone.. My iPhone is connected to all my other computers and mobile devices.. While I'm sure a programmer could get this all to work with an Android after a year of work, it's trivial for an artist like me to get all my media up and synchronized across all my devices.. All my photos and website links and notes and contacts and music and movies are all on all of my devices.. If I want to play music at my pool, I wake up Apple's free Remote app, and it just turns on my auto-switching amplifier and plays any of my 200 GB music library from my office Mac Pro outside via my AirPort Express. It's trivial to create a whole-house music system and play any music or streaming service from the iPhone, or from my master library, in any room of the house.. I can play any of my thousands of videos from my office Mac Pro to any of my Apple TVs , again all controlled from the iPhone. Everyone has a ton of videos they've shot, and since I have them all on my Mac Pro, I actually can play any of my kid or vacation videos in a few clicks. I can play anything from my vast home library on my iPhone using Apple's Home Sharing. Even with the 16 GB iPhone, I can play any music or video from my huge Mac Pro's library directly to my iPhone, all while it's still stored on my Mac. I can even play different files from the same Mac Pro on different devices at the same time, and it was easy to set up.. In good light, the iPhone has better color rendition than LEICA or Sony digital cameras. It's as good as Nikon and Canon.. The iPhone has better exposure and automatic white balance than any other camera.. The iPhone is a fantastic camera for most things, but there are always some things for which one needs a DSLR.. A DSLR works far better in the dark. The iPhone 6 Plus reduces color saturation to reduce noise in dim light. One can't make time exposures at low ISOs in dim light with the iPhone, while this is easy with a DSLR.. The larger sensor of a DSLR make it easy to shoot in dim light, while the iPhone will be grainier, less detailed, and less colorful.. There's only one lens with the iPhone, which is usually exactly the lens you need. It has digital zoom in both still and video modes, but if you need telephoto, zoom, wide angle or fisheye lenses, you still need your DSLR. I'm not going to fool with dopey accessory lenses; the beauty of iPhone is its simplicity.. The iPhone usually gets everything in focus. If you need shallow depth-of-field, you need a DSLR.. I always carry my iPhone when using a DSLR. I pull out the iPhone when I need an easy closeup, a shot from a crazy angle, or need to send the shot right away.. The iPhone and DSLR work perfectly together. Each does what the other can't. Holy cow; I tested a Beyerdynamic A200p DAC and headphone amp at the same time I had the iPhone 6 Plus in my audio lab, and the iPhone 6 Plus beat it! The iPhone 6 Plus has less distortion, flatter frequency response and much better ability to drive low-impedance headphones with low distortion than the dedicated portable amp!. While all iOS devices have always sounded great if you have good transfers , the audio output of the iPhone 6 Plus is now so improved that it sounds and measures about as well as professional reference DACs like the Benchmark DAC1 HDR , and better than many consumer DACs .. The iPhone 6 Plus even has flatter response than the Benchmark DAC1 HDR ! Of course an iPhone and a plug-in-the-wall professional DAC are intended for entirely different pupposes, but if the 1 volt RMS output (6 dB less than good outboard DACs and CD players) and 3.5mm jack do it for you, there's no reason not to use the iPhone's output for critical listening.. The iPhone 6 is a better analog audio source than many audiophile products, but the cottage industry created around selling you DACs and other accessories you don't need doesn't want you to know. Remember that accessory dealers, manufacturers and publications that accept advertising from these makers have a vested interest in trying to create FUD about the iPhone's audio quality. Don't beleive them and listen for yourself.. Apple has more smart engineers and far more resources than any other audio specialty company. It makes perfect sense that the iPhone output should be spectacular.. No longer do you need to waste money on DACs and headphone amplifiers, at least for most portable (low-impedance) headphones. Save your money and spend it on more music instead.. Hint: Always leave the iPhone's level all the way up when using it as a program source fed to preamp.. I live in cargo shorts, and love the big iPhone 6 Plus.. For women, or for men who wear suits, it might be too big. I had a neighbor who got one of the first 6 Plus, and she hated the size and returned it for a regular iPhone 6.. If you mostly use it as a phone, the smaller version works better. I rarely use the phone, and when I do, it takes a moment to find the right spot to stick my ear.. I prefer the huge iPhone 6 Plus. I love the huge screen, I love the huge battery and I love the optically stabilized camera lens.. The best portable headphones I've found at any price are the Beyerdynamic T51i. The included Ear Pods sound great when you use the Dirac app ..

I spent a week switching between the iPhone 6 Plus and Samsung Galaxy Note 5 — here’s how they compare. Lisa Eadicicco , Business Insider US. Side-by-side: The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and the Apple iPhone 6 Plus. Both phones are gorgeous, but with the Note 5 you get a slightly larger screen packed into a phone that’s the same size as the iPhone 6 Plus.The Note 5’s screen displays colors more vibrantly than the iPhone, but it’s not any sharper than the iPhone’s screen even though it’s a higher spec.The iPhone is still much more simple to use than Samsung’s phone.The Note 5’s S Pen feels natural and the multiwindow feature is useful, but Samsung’s version of Android is still too cluttered for me.Both phones take excellent photos. It’s a win-win here, but, as is the case with the Note 5’s display, its camera also sometimes exaggerates color. What it’s like to use them. The Samsung Galaxy Note 5’s note-taking mode. You can check out our full camera shootout here>>. If you’re looking for a phone with a large screen, the iPhone 6 Plus and Galaxy Note 5 are by far the best choices on the market right now. Both phones have gorgeous metal and glass designs, offer fast performance and long battery life, and capture excellent photos.. It’s tough to decide between the two – ultimately, it boils down to whether or not you prefer iOS or Android, and whether or not having extra features such as a stylus really matter to you.. But if your buying choice is more complicated than that, there are a few differences between the iPhone 6 Plus and Galaxy Note 5 that you may want to consider.. Both phones will cost you a decent amount of money. The iPhone 6 Plus starts at $750 off-contract, while the Note 5 starts at around $700 without a carrier subsidy.. After spending a week switching between the two, here’s what I came away with.. The Galaxy Note 5 is the best-looking Note phone Samsung has ever made. The company added smooth metal edges and a glossy, curved glass back to its design, which is a noticeable difference from the Note 4’s more rigid edges and faux leather back. The new phone looks a lot like the Galaxy S6, which is a good thing.. Although it’s made of metal, the phone is still incredibly light and thin. The case is the same for the iPhone 6 Plus, which features a uniformly slim and sleek design. Unlike the Note 5, the iPhone’s back is made of aluminum, and the phone’s thickness is the same all around. This gives it a more consistent and clean look, as opposed to the Note 5, which varies slightly in thickness due to its curved back.. While I prefer the iPhone’s simplicity, it’s hard not to marvel at the way Samsung managed to pack such a large screen into a phone that’s essentially the same size as the iPhone 6 Plus. Samsung’s new phone has a 5.7-inch screen, which is slightly larger than the iPhone 6 Plus’ 5.5-inch screen. Despite this, Samsung’s phone isn’t any wider or taller than Apple’s because its bezels are so thin.. The only downside to Samsung’s new design is that since it’s glossy, it easily picks up fingerprint smudges.. Both phones offer sharp and crisp displays, but there’s one major difference. The Note 5 renders colors much more vibrantly than the iPhone, and it’s really noticeable when you compare the two phones side by side.. When watching the trailer for “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part II” on both phones alongside one another, colors look almost entirely different in some scenes. In one still image where the environment was covered in snow, Samsung’s phone rendered the scene with a blueish hue. The iPhone, comparatively, looked more white than blue.. The difference in color was also really evident in scenes with lots of red, orange, and yellow colors. At the end of the trailer, in the scene where the logo for the film is bursting with flames, the colors are way brighter on Samsung’s phone, while they were deeper and more muted on the iPhone. In the image below, you’ll notice the colors are bolder and warmer on the Note 5’s screen.. In terms of sharpness, both displays seemed equal. On paper, the Galaxy Note 5 should be much sharper and more detailed, since it crams in way more pixels per inch on the screen than the iPhone. The Note 5 has a screen resolution of 2560 x 1440, while the iPhone 6 Plus has a resolution of 1920 x 1080.. The biggest difference between each phone isn’t physical – it’s the software. The iPhone is more simple and basic, but that also means it doesn’t do as much. Other than a few quick shortcuts that are accessible by swiping up from the bottom of the screen, the iPhone’s interface basically only consists of app icons, the lock screen, and the notification drawer, which you can find by swiping down from the top of the screen.. Simply put, Samsung’s phone does a lot more. You can open more than one app at a time in a split screen view. You can also open an app in a realizable window on the home screen the same way you would drag a window around your computer’s desktop. In my experience, these features came in handy occasionally. I usually don’t mind switching between apps when I need to, but in a few cases I found myself using split screen to keep my Google Hangouts chat open while scrolling through my Facebook feed.. The case is the same with Samsung’s S Pen, which is much improved this time around compared to the previous model. It’s easier to eject from the phone since it’s spring loaded (just please make sure you don’t insert it backwards ), and it has a more premium design.. I used Samsung’s S Note app to jot down notes during one of our staff brainstorming meetings instead of my notebook, and it felt smooth and natural, almost as if I was writing on paper. You can also write on the screen while it’s turned off with the Note 5, which makes it convenient to jot down ideas more quickly on the fly. The one drawback was that once you save and name a document in S Note, you still have to actually type in the name instead of handwriting it, which felt a bit awkward.. One of my favorite Samsung extras is the camera shortcut, which quickly launches the camera with two taps of the home button. The iPhone doesn’t have any camera shortcuts, other than the icon on the lock screen that allows you to launch the camera without unlocking the phone.. That being said, Samsung’s version of Android is still too busy for me. The home screen is simple enough, but once you swipe over to the second home screen you see Samsung’s Galaxy Gifts and Galaxy Essentials widgets on the top portion of the screen, which I have no use for. Swipe to the third home screen, and there’s a widget that takes over the entire screen for Papergarden, Samsung’s magazine store.. I generally prefer Google’s clean, unmodified version of Android, which doesn’t come with any extras from phone manufacturers or carriers. Of course you can modify these and delete widgets you don’t need, but it’s still a slight annoyance that they’re there by default.. The iPhone isn’t completely void of this either – there are some Apple-made apps that I personally don’t use that I can’t delete, but they’re more subtle and don’t take up a lot of space on the home screen.. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy Note 5 also proved to be faster than that of the iPhone 6 Plus. It wasn’t a really noticeable difference, but the Note 5 was just a fraction of a second faster than the iPhone.. Another thing you can expect to get from both phones is excellent battery life. I usually get a solid day and a half out of both phones without charging them.. Both the Galaxy Note 5 and iPhone 6 Plus come with great cameras capable of producing detailed images, but there are a few differences to note. In my experience, the Note 5’s cameras makes colors appear bolder and brighter, similar to the way its screen renders colors more vibrantly. It also makes skin appear smoother, but almost to the point where it seems unnatural.. Photos taken with the iPhone look a bit dull in comparison, but the colors seems to be truer to the scene. The camera in Apple’s iPhone is also exceptionally good at taking in light, since it’s able to capture images in which the subject is still visible even in low-light conditions.. Here are some camera samples from both phones:. This close-up photo of a bush was taken with the iPhone 6 Plus:. And here’s that same photo taken with the Note 5:. Here’s a nearly pitch-black portrait photo taken with the iPhone:. Now here’s the Note 5’s version:. To be clear, both phones are excellent and would be an ideal choice for those seeking a large-screened phone. But, if you’re really trying to choose between the two, here’s what you need to know.. The Note 5 has an amazing screen and lots of features that make multitasking easier, such as its multiwindow functionality and included S Pen stylus. Those are the two areas where it really shines over the iPhone.. The iPhone, on the other hand, is more simple and doesn’t come with any bloatware. Its software is less busy, which makes it easier to use from the moment you pick it up. It takes excellent photos, especially in low light, and the general app ecosystem is more polished. That’s important if you care about getting the best apps as soon as they launch, since many apps such as Instagram, Vine, and Periscope were all available for the iPhone before they launched on Android..
