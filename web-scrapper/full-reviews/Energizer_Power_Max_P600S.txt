Energizer Power Max P600S launches with a powerful 4500mAh battery. Almost the same time last year, Energizer has rolled out the E520LTE and E550LTE smartphones. The MWC 2017 was actually the launching pad of the two phones. This year, the brand is introducing the Power Max P600S that is powered by a 4500mAh battery. The name alone is enough to convince the market it has a very powerful and high-capacity battery–an improvement from last year’s 4000mAh batt. We know Energizer has sold other phones before but we haven’t really given attention to them.. Nowadays, people are looking for phones with longer-lasting batteries. Sure, power banks and fast chargers can be helpful but a big battery will be enough on its own. Standard batteries of flagship phones are 3000 to 3500mAh so if it’s bigger than the range, then we consider it already a powerhouse like this new phone from Energizer.. The Energizer Power Max P600S is licensed by Avenir Telecom. Apart from the high-capacity battery, the smartphone comes equipped with the following: 6-inch screen, 2160 x 1080 pixel resolution, 6GB RAM, 64GB onboard storage, microSD card slot for memory expansion, dual-camera system, and a rear fingerprint sensor. The device is powered by a MediaTek P600S processor.. The phone looks durable with its faux carbon fiber pattern but the rear cover is only made of plastic. The phone runs Android Nougat out of the box. Price tag reads $349.99 for the 3GB RAM, 32GB storage while the 64GB model costs $439.99. Availability will start next month in Europe. As for the US, the phone will launch in the American market by next quarter.. New Energizer E520LTE, E550LTE smartphones introduced at MWC 2017.

Energizer Power Max P600S Smartphone Launched By Tyler Lee on 01/07/2018 20:42 PST. When you think of the brand Energizer, chances are you are thinking about batteries, but in the past few years we’ve seen the company start to branch out towards smartphones. In fact the company has recently taken the wraps off its latest smartphone in the form of the Energizer Power Max P600S .. In terms of design, we have to admit that we are getting a bit of a Samsung Galaxy S8/Note 8 kind of vibe, thanks to the edge-to-edge curved display, but design is pretty much where the similarities end. The P600S will feature a 5.99-inch Full HD 18:9 display, dual 13MP + 5MP rear-facing cameras, an 8MP front-facing camera, and under the hood a MediaTek Helio P25 octa-core processor can be found.. There will also be options of 3GB or 6GB of RAM to choose from, 32-64GB of onboard storage that can be further expanded via microSD, fingerprint security, dual-SIM support, fast charging, and a whopping 4,500mAh battery that should last you a while. It will also come with Android 7.0 Nougat preinstalled and unfortunately there is no mention if there will be plans to eventually bump it up to Android 8.0 Oreo. Pricing was not mentioned but it is expected to go on sale mid-January 2018.. Read more about Energizer ..

Korea. who sell this phone? what country?. where can I buy this unit?. Anonymous, 09 Jan 2018 Anyone can build a chip, it's not even a problem. The problem is having 8 A53 cores. more Phone being made by a brand not known to make smartphones isn't a problem. I remember when Xiaomi and Huawei were nobodies in smartphone industry.. Ravuh, 09 Jan 2018 Only reason they hate it is 'cause it's cheap and they love their SD powered premium phones so... more Anyone can build a chip, it's not even a problem. The problem is having 8 A53 cores. And a phone being made by Energizer :p. Anonymous, 08 Jan 2018 right, a lot of clowns really generalizes MTK as sh!t when SD does as well with their other gens Only reason they hate it is 'cause it's cheap and they love their SD powered premium phones so much. I have the faster exynos version of Note 8 (which is faster than its SD835 counterpart) and it's not even comparable to Mate 10 pro's 970 nor X's A11 bionic. Ironically, i don't like emui, iOS, and even lagwiz (only reason i got the Note 8 is there's no OnePlus 5T sold here, just online and unless there's local service centers for OP, not gonna get it).. Ravuh, 08 Jan 2018 Not really. The problem is it's Helio P25, not Helio X30. right, a lot of clowns really generalizes MTK as sh!t when SD does as well with their other gens. Anonymous, 08 Jan 2018 the problem is mediatek Not really. The problem is it's Helio P25, not Helio X30.. RedHagar, 06 Jan 2018 If this is correct, it does not support AC WiFi protocols. That would end it for me. more it's same for me I even stoped reading the specification of this phone when i saw that it doesn't support AC and sure if so I'm not buying it even if I was looking for something like this. Lenovo p2 has better battery perfomance. If this is correct, it does not support AC WiFi protocols. That would end it for me. You can't release a serious phone in 2018 without AC.. It should have a lifetime battery and made the record ha ha ha ha lol. Pages: 1 2 ». Total of 40 user reviews and opinions for Energizer Power Max P600S ..

Log in Sign up. The Energizer Bunny is now an Android: meet the Energizer Power Max 600s. Energizer is famous for making batteries, but the company dabbles in phones as well. Mostly feature phones, but a few Androids as well and the new Energizer Power Max P600s is its best effort so far.. The phone is built around a 4,500mAh battery, which promises over 12 hours of use and 16 days of standby. You can stretch that with the power saving mode and quickly fill up the battery with fast charging over USB-C.. The phone itself is 9.8mm thick, which is more than we expected  for comparison a Mate10 Pro with a 4,000mAh is 7.9mm thick. And the battery is not outrageously big though it is bigger than most phones out there.. Anyway, were glad someone else went for the rare carbon fiber look on the back (BlackBerry is the only other company that comes to mind). The colors are important here  the Black version comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage while the Blue one doubles both numbers (6GB/64GB). Theres a microSD slot if thats still not enough.. The Power Max P600s features an 18:9 screen  5.99 big with 1080p+ resolution and rounded corners for a modern look. Android 7.0 Nougat runs on a Helio P25 chipset (more of a long distance runner than a sprinter).. Energizer sourced a 13MP + 5MP dual camera from Samsung for the back and put a fingerprint reader on there too. On the front, theres an 8MP selfie camera with its own flash.. The phone will become available in mid-January and will be sold by the following retailers. We don't have info on the price just yet.. Energizer Energy E550LTE is a rugged smartphone with 4GB RAM and dual camera setup. How do we get 3-4 day battery life & when?. Counterclockwise: tracking battery growth over the years.
