There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Good phone. Offer Type: Snapdragon 630 (2.2GHz Octa-Core) | Size: 4GB RAM | 64GB Storage | Color: Black | Verified Purchase. I really want to like this phone. I am a big ASUS fan and have many of their products. I had a Zenfone 3 Deluxe before this. This one is also good, up to one key point. There is a lot to like about the Zenfone 4. I like the design and feel. It is responsive and comes with just enough apps to be useful, but not irritating. It is a fun phone to use. But I can't get it to connect to AT&T with LTE. This could be a deal breaker for me. After 4 days and 3 L3 AT&T techs, this phone will only connect with HPSA+. This is a high 3G speed. I have done all of the typical solutions. Verified APN settings and even tried changing a few.changes suggested by AT&T. I have done a Factory reset. AT&T has added my IMEI number to their LTE list. My SIM card has been partitioned for LTE. This phone's firmware just doesn't seem to work on the AT&T LTE network. But the lack of LTE compatibility, despite the fact that it is mentioned all over the ASUS website and this ad, really brings the rating down. EDIT 12/1/2017: I am back on Team ASUS. To fix my LTE issue, I had to dig deep into the ASUS formus. I found the fix in a old 2016 post for a different phone. Since I had a new SIM card for this phone, i needed to take a SIM from another phone that was already working on the AT&T LTE network. After inserting the LTE SIM and booting up the phone, i had an LTE connection. Then I swapped back my SIM and Viola! LTE connection. it seems that there is no way to have this done through Customer Service on the phone. So, I Love this phone again!!!!!. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars High quality phone at a really low price. Offer Type: Snapdragon 430 (1.4GHz Octa-Core) | Size: 3GB RAM | 32GB Storage | Color: Black | Verified Purchase. The material looks fine and expensive, I like the dual camera as it takes very fine photos and the wide angle photos with the second camera are definitely a plus. The flash is decent, now the front camera is really amazing as it takes photos that look very clear and the selfie flash also helps a lot in the darkness. The fingerprint sensor works very well, the overall performance is very fast, I can work with many apps open without getting the phone slow. The speakers are ok, nothing extraordinary but very nice. The battery is outstanding, I've listened to music the whole day for 2 days and made some calls and it was still at 21%. The look of the phone is really attractive, I have the blue navy version and it is awesome. It is not heavy, the size is fine and looks like it was a very expensive phone although it cost me $199. I definitely recommend the phone to anyone looking for good performance, good photos, and speed.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars You will love the phone if you like.

You will love the phone if you like: 1) dual sims, LTE and compatible with Tmobile, ATT network 2) Cheap price 3) Dedicated Micro-SD slot 4) Not slow and OK speed 5) US warranty in case something goes wrong within 1 year 6) A close-to-Iphone copycat look except the home button 7) front end fingerprint identification You may not like: 1) 720p display 2) Bluetooth not stable (I agree with previous reviewer though my works OK most of the time for matched connections) It's a pity that the price dropped another $20 since my order less than 2 month ago. In summary this is probably one of the best dual-sim unlocked budget phones with dedicated MicroSD slot in the US. The competion are Honors, alcatel idols, Moto G5, ZTEs, etc. at the below $300 range, though none of these have all the features that I mentioned.... Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Unbelievable phone for only $200 new. Offer Type: Snapdragon 430 (1.4GHz Octa-Core) | Size: 3GB RAM | 32GB Storage | Color: Black | Verified Purchase. ASUS strengths (other than obvious features such as the microSD card slot) compared to the iPhone: faster and smoother operating, huge improvement in battery life, Microsoft apps (such as OneDrive and OneNote) are faster, downloaded videos play without occasional hickups. Worse than the iPhone: weaker speakers and the cellular/wifi radios are not as sensitive. Missing: no wifi calling on the AT&T network. Looking forward to the ASUS AR when it drops in price. Hopefully AT&T will add wifi calling support for that phone. True total price for me is $260 since I added a 128GB SanDisk memory cart for a total of 160GB vs 128GB on the iPhone. It is possible that the slower storage built into the iPhone (which can't be replaced or upgraded) was the cause of the video playing hickups.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars This phones awesome.. Offer Type: Snapdragon 430 (1.4GHz Octa-Core) | Size: 3GB RAM | 32GB Storage | Color: Black | Verified Purchase. I've had this phone well over a month now- easily, easily my favorite phone I've had. I bought this phone because my favorite phone used to be the zenfone 2. I've had a lot of other phones, but nothing has compared to the zenfone so far. It's smooth, I've yet to have any lags or complications whatsoever. This phone doesn't feel cheap at all, its nice and sturdy, the picture is clear. I don't really have any cons yet. Also, i have no clue if this phone is water resistant or not. But the other day I accidentally submerged this phone completely in water. Only for a sec, but still. But I've still had no complications, nothing. I love this phone!!! The thumb detector has always been really great too. I thought it'd be glitchy or annoying but its actually really convenient. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great phone for a great price!. Offer Type: Snapdragon 430 (1.4GHz Octa-Core) | Size: 3GB RAM | 32GB Storage | Color: Black | Verified Purchase. This is a really great deal for a phone that does everything I need it to do- and the battery life is awesome. I guess some folks want more bells or whistles or what not- but for me, I honestly don't see where this phone is lacking in anything that I need. I haven't encountered any performance issues so far, although I do not use my phone for gaming- just business. Battery life is really excellent- so much so that it actually has a cable that lets you connect your ASUS phone to charge other phones! There were a couple of comments here in the reviews regarding the camera quality- and they made me a little nervous as to whether or not I made the right choice- but I can only say I can't understand that criticism at all. The camera is excellent for anything I have used it for since I received my phone. All in all, this phone does everything I need very well, and the price is awesome. I highly recommend it if you are a function over form person such as myself.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars.

T wo months ago, we covered the ASUS Zenfone 4 Max Pro as a smartphone with a monster battery. Apparently, the phone has a sister with an ability that resembles, the Asus Zenfone 4 Max ZC520KL. ASUS Zenfone 4 Max ZC520KL can be said as Zenfone 4 Max Pro compact version. If the ASUS Zenfone 4 Max Pro is the 5.5-inch screen with 5,000 mAh battery, the Asus Zenfone 4 Max ZC520KL uses 5.2-inch screen and 4,100 mAh battery. In addition, the use of processors and cameras are also different. Well, whether a more compact version of this can follow the ability of his brother? Let’s check out the following review.. ASUS Zenfone 4 Max ZC520KL Review. Coming as a compact version of the Zenfone 4 Max Pro, this phone is still able to look compelling. The allure of course on a battery that durable. Although not present with the highest specification on the market, aka carrying the mainstream SoC Snapdragon 425 from Qualcomm, this smartphone can still be relied upon for daily multitasking work.. Following the trend that is popular, Asus Zenfone 4 Max comes with a unibody design that makes it look solid. In order to look elegant, ASUS relies on metal finishing to make it look more elegant. But do not be fooled, because the casing is actually not made of metal, but plastic polycarbonate type of light on the back.. However, the use of plastic materials is sure to reduce production costs. And Asus has managed to make a phone with a nice design without looking cheap. The sides are rounded to fit comfortably.. Zenfone 4 Max ZC520KL is designed with this metallic finish comes with three color choices, Deepsea Black, Sunlight Gold, Rose Pink. The boys would certainly prefer the color of the Black Sea Depp is masculine, while the weather will be captivated by the color of rose pink that suits his character.. Asus ZenFone 4 Max has a screen measuring 5.2 inches HD resolution (720×1280 pixels). On the screen is also equipped with 2.5D Curved glass that not only makes smartphone look more beautiful but also helps the perfect glass screen with diamond cut metallic chamfered edge and add comfort when holding the unit.. ASUS uses an In-Plane Switching (IPS) type screen capable of presenting images with the good color reproduction from various angles, up to 178 degrees. IPS screen is also equipped with LEDs that have a brightness above 400nits. So that we can read the content in various light conditions.. With the HD screen, the ASUS ZenFone 4 Max ZC520KL is fairly comfortable enough to be used to play movies or watch multimedia content from the Internet. Video files or video streaming from YouTube can be played with optimum display quality. Although of course cannot be compared with the Full HD screen is more detailed and sharp. Especially when compared with the 2k screen from some premium mobile phone.. The interface design that adorns this phone is still carrying ZenUI 3.0. Somewhat surprising why use the old version. Though his colleagues in the Zenfone series 4 has been using ZenUI 4.0 including Zenfone 4 Max Pro though.. Nevertheless, Asus argues that ZenUI 3.0 on Asus Zenfone 4 Max ZC520KL smartphone gets an update and upgrade to Android Nougat. this UI comes with Motion Gesture and Quick Trigger for One Hand mode where users can instantly pick up calls by dragging the smartphone to the ear or pressing the home button twice to activate One Hand Mode.. Dual camera is like a mantra for mainstream smartphone manufacturers. Not considered cool if you have not used dual cameras. And it seems, this mantra is also attached Asus in which the entire range of Zenfone 4 must use Dual Camera, although not necessarily need very, very.. Well, what’s the difference between Zenfone 4 Max and 4 Max Pro? Both are carrying dual camera configuration for the rear camera, but there is little difference in both these smartphones. If Zenfone 4 Max Pro ZC554KL comes with a 16-megapixel resolution camera on the back, the Zenfone 4 Max ZC520KL comes equipped with a 13-megapixel camera on the main camera and 5 megapixels for a second camera with 120-degree wide lens.. 13 MP camera provides better detail, while the wide angle is suitable for photographing objects with wide viewing angle. Such as panoramic or interior room. We can easily shift the use of the standard lens or wide-angle lens with menus contained in the camera interface.. The latest smartphone from ASUS is also equipped with PixelMaster 4.0 Camera which makes the rear camera has a fast autofocus accuracy up to 0.03 seconds autofocus detected phase detection.. In addition to Phase Detection, PixelMaster 4.0 Camera also features EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) feature that enables users to take less-than-vibration video. In the main camera, a smartphone is equipped with EIS 3-Axis system that is claimed will help minimize shocks on the results of recorded video captured. There’s also a Super Resolution feature that lets users get better detail thanks to higher resolutions of up to 64 megapixels.. In terms of shooting mode, Asus ZenFone 4 Max ZC520KL provides a variety of shooting mode options that can be exploited by users for various needs. Starting from Auto, Pro, Beauty, Super Resolution, Gif Animation, Panorama and Time Lapse. Various photo filters and HDR features, Wide Angle and Portrait can also be activated to get the photos you want.. As for the front camera, available shooting modes are Beauty, Auto, GIF Animation, Selfie Panorama. Interestingly front camera has been equipped with Softlight LED flash that can make users do selfie photos in low light conditions.. In addition, thanks to the presence of Beauty features will improve the results of facial photos directly with a variety of make-up effects including softener and skin lightening, blush and color correction, modify the shape of the eye, until the cheek shape.. In Zen UI 3.0 update version, you can enjoy Selfie Master application. In it, you can take advantage of the smartphone’s 8-megapixel front camera to selfie in the form of photos and video.. In fact, we can take advantage of BeautyLive feature that allows you to do live broadcasting with beautification feature so that the face will feel more interesting when chatting with the fans directly in cyberspace.. BeautyLive feature also provides a direct shortcut button to perform live broadcasting through several applications such as Facebook or Youtube. The amount can be increased depending on what live broadcast application you install on this smartphone.. Well, what about the photographs? Approximately equal to Asus Zenfone 4 Max Pro.. OPPO F5 Youth Offers Cheaper Prices, with Full Screen FHD +…. Launched in Indonesia, Vivo V7 Selfie Smartphone Delivers 3…. Although included in the second-class mobile phone millions are affordable, but the affairs of connectivity, this phone is quite capable. Because it has supported 4G LTE Cat 4 with Dual SIM Card.

As for security matters, Zenfone 4 Max ZC520KL is equipped with a fingerprint sensor that is located on the front of the body of the smartphone, together with the Home button.. To beautify the look, this sensor has a chrome accent color adjusted color smartphone around it. The fingerprint sensor enables registering up to five fingers at a time, and this sensor can still read the fingerprint even if putting the finger in any position.. From internal testing, Lithium Polymer type battery that is embedded in ZenFone 4 Max ZC520KL can last up to 37 days when in the standby condition in the 4G network.

Smartphone ASUS Zenfone 4 Max ZC520KL Na is rated. Rated 4 out of. peu de recul encore pour vraiment parler de ce produit mais pour le moment il répond à mes attentes et tient les caractéristiques annoncées par la vendeuse et le fabriquant. Rated 5 out of. Facilité et longue durée batterie et je voudrais. Rated 3 out of. Bon appareil dans l'ensemble mais trés mauvais en photo. réglage en tout genre et l'on s'y perd. À la vente on vous vente les deux objectifs dont un grand angle mais cela n'a aucun intérêt au regard de la qualité des photos. Il faut sans arrêt aller dans les réglages en mode manuel. Autant dire que le sujet à prendre en photo a le temps de passer!!!! Pour le reste, navigation recherche sur internet rien à dire. Rated 2 out of. Comme ca il présente bien, il fonctionne bien, mais faut pas espérer faire de belle photo, malgré le mode pro, pas de capteur de lumière, donc si ca n'est pas plein jour au soleil, pas de résultat... De plus, il faut prévoir d'acheter un haut parleur Bluetooth pour entendre la musique...... le Nokia 6 est au même prix et de bien meilleur qualité..... Asus devrait ce contenter et ce concentrer sur les ordis et tablettes.. Rated 4 out of. Téléphone rapide en 32 mo..usage pratique.au quotidien. !
