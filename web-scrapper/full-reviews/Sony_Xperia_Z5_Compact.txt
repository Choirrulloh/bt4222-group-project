CNET también está disponible en español.. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact review:. The best mini Android phone around. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact (graphite black). CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact's small size makes it very comfortable to use, but without sacrificing the power and performance of a flagship phone. Its camera takes great shots and it won't die when you get it wet.. The Bad Its blocky design lacks the finesse of other flagship handsets.. The Bottom Line By squashing powerful specs into a smaller, water-resistant body, the Z5 Compact earns the title of best "mini" Android phone.. Why do I want a smaller screen?. Is it still good for gaming?. Is it less powerful than the full-size Z5? What about the camera?. I called Sony's Xperia Z3 Compact the best "mini" phone around in 2014, and now Sony is here to defend that title with the new Xperia Z5 Compact. Like its predecessor, the 4.6-inch Z5 Compact is loaded with most of the same specs as its full-size flagship siblings, but compresses them into a much more portable body.. Rival manufacturers tend to heavily water down the specs of their "mini flagships" -- I'm looking at you, LG G4C and Samsung S5 Mini. Sony's diminutive handset, however, is as proud a flagship as the standard Z5 , containing as it does most of the same top-end specs. In addition to the potent Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor under its 4.6-inch screen, the Z5 Compact has a great 23-megapixel camera, a water-resistant design, a fingerprint scanner, expandable storage and a battery that won't quit on you before the day is done.. It's available now in the UK for £390, which is an extremely reasonable price. Particularly when Sony's other Z5 phones, the standard Z5 and the Z5 Premium both come with sky-high price tags of £549 and £630 respectively. In Australia it'll cost you AU$849, which is approximately what the UK price converts to. In the US, it'll cost $500 and sell February 7.. Most top-end phones have swollen to huge proportions with screens pushing 6 inches. Wrapping your hands around those Goliaths isn't easy and texting with just one hand is impossible. You can easily hold the Xperia Z5 Compact in one hand and comfortably stretch your thumb across the whole screen. It's fairly slim at 8.9 millimetres (0.35 inches) thick and weighs just 138 grams (4.86 ounces) so it'll sit unnoticed in your jeans pocket.. If gaming is your main focus for a phone then you should look for something with a larger display. The Compact's screen is perfectly suitable for calling, texting, social networking and so on, but games and movies aren't as immersive as they are on larger phones. Its processor is powerful enough to run games, of course, but the small screen size doesn't really do them justice.. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas plays extremely smoothly, for example, but using the on-screen controls means that your thumbs are covering up a significant portion of the action. Matching up candies in Candy Crush isn't as easy either. Sure, the 720p resolution might seem low when compared to the 2K (and even 4K!) displays seen on larger phones, but the screen's smaller size means it doesn't need as many pixels to remain sharp.. Indeed, the Compact's screen is perfectly crisp, as well as being bright and displaying vivid colours too.. No, not by an amount you'd really notice. Both phones run on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810 processor, but the Compact has 2GB of RAM, rather than the 3GB you get on the standard Z5. In benchmark tests, performance is very close -- I found nothing I could do on the Z5 that I couldn't do on the Compact.. The 23-megapixel camera on the Compact is the same one that's used on the rest of the Z5 series phones, and the Compact's is just as good as its siblings'. Shots are well exposed for the most part and colours are rich too. The white balance can sometimes be a bit off, but it's very easy to tweak the colour balance to warm up a shot a little..

Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges..

EDIT (1/9/16): My original evaluation of this phone remains the same but I would encourage people to look at the HTC One A9 as it addresses the US compatability aspect while still being pocketable. It is not as compact as the Z5c, meaning Sony is still the only name in the game but the A9 is still manageable. You can read my review here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B017D554UK I have been through every phone you can imagine and the Sony Xperia Compact line continues to impress me. I recently had a Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x and the sizes are just to much for me. Yes, I really want Marshmallow but can wait an extra few weeks for it. I asked a few questions before buying and had trouble getting clear information due to the technical nature, but wanted to clarify for those who are looking. This phone is almost fully compatible with T-Mobile USA and I can confirm Band 12 (Extended Range LTE) *does* work (confirmed with LTE Discovery). However, there is no HD Voice, VoLTE or WiFi Calling. For me, these trade-offs were well worth it because of the phenomenal battery life (which will likely get better on Marshmallow), the compact form factor and water resistance (just nice to have as a backup). If WiFi calling is an issue for you, you can use something like Hangouts phone calls as a backup. It is of course not as convenient, but it works. HD Voice is only compatible T-Mobile <> T-Mobile and, yes, you can tell the difference and I wish I had it - but again, not a huge trade-off. VoLTE is the one that gets me. For those of you that don't know, this means the phone drops your data down to 3G/HSPA when making a phone call. Not the end of the world but you may notice the difference when navigating, tethering to your PC, trying to navigate, etc. Again, you could get around this by using a third-party dialer (Hangouts) since that is a VoIP call but for most people, this may be overkill. I suspect though most people buying this phone are pretty familiar with these things since the phone is not advertised in the US. The lack of VoLTE/WiFi Calling/HD Voice is the only reason I knocked off a star. Note the phone comes with an international charger and adapter. It is compatible with QuickCharge technology and charges rapidly for example with this. Swiftrans 3221263 Quick Charge 2.0 36W Dual Ports USB Car Charger The camera on the phone is pretty good - not the best - but will be fine for 9/10 people. I am using the phone with. Aomax® For Sony Xperia Z5 Compact / Mini Tempered Glass Screen Protector [Superslim 0.26mm,2.5D Round Edge,9H Hardness] [Retail Package] For(Sony Xperia Z5 Compact / Mini). Orzly® - FlexiSlim Case for SONY XPERIA Z5 COMPACT (2015 SmartPhone Model / Smallest Version / XPERIA Z5 MINI) - Super Slim (0.35mm) Protective Phone Cover in Semi Transparent WHITE. It was important to me I protected the device but didn't go overboard on the bulkiness - the combination of these two are perfect. I have reviewed each of these independently but included one picture here of the phone, glass and case together. Overall this is an awesome phone for people who aren't concerned about buying direct from a carrier and don't want a huge phone.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars If you want an Android *phone* in 2015, this is it. If you want an Android *phone* - not a mini-tablet, something that fits in your hand and doesn't feel like a plate of armor in your front pocket - Sony is now the only game in town (and not in any USA towns...these are imports). I've only owned Nexi before this, but I find Sony's customizations are almost all additive, like glove mode or being able to reboot or screenshot with a click of the power button. Any uninstallable apps you don't like, just disable in Settings. I use mine without a case and with a lanyard (not included, but I bought some silver ones on Amazon for about $5), which adds no bulk, keeps the phone pure but like a case, offers (preventative) protection against drops. Some have complained about the "lip" of the outer frame, but I don't find it remotely bothersome in hand and it protects the glass. It's functional - something any great design must be, not just beautiful. I laugh at all the iPhones wearing ugly cases. I have noticed a couple of intermittent software bugs here & there (example: blacks sometimes look gray when waking from sleep and auto-adjust brightness is on) but nothing I can't live with, and Sony has OTA-air shipped both a firmware and a camera update in the month I've owned the phone. Battery life is great, solidly over a day with moderatly heavy screen-on time use and up to two days with Stamina mode enabled. I hope Sony sells enough to make Z5 Compact successors.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Good so far. It's been a few weeks and having no issues so far. Good form factor but when the phone gets hot, it becomes uncomfortable to hold so I def recommend a case. The phone is also a bit thick though I suppose it's necessary due to the waterproof material and other hardware necessities to make it up to par with typical devices. The SIM and SD card slots are easily accessible. Fingerprint sensor works great and is super convenient. Battery life lasts a full day but I don't see it going past a full day on normal usage (I'm typically on wifi and 4G). Sony also releases frequent software updates which is amazing compared to manufacturers like Samsung and HTC that take forever to come out with updates. Recently there was a update which allows the camera to launch much faster.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Phone of the year.. When I first held this phone, I had the sudden urge to hum the James Bond theme. There is no other way to put it. It's hands-down the most premium feeling phone I've held - and that's with it swinging against the big guns such as the S6 Edge, HTC One, and iPhone 6. Cons: -I'm not a huge fan of the frosted back, and think it would have looked better with a normal glass back or just a continuation of the excellent plastic used for the sides. This is largely personal preference though. -The volume rocker is in an extremely awkward position. Unlike the Z3 Compact, you really have to work to use it. Would have been better located above the power button. -It comes in Japanese, and it's very difficult to find the language setting. Pull down the notification bar, then again for settings, click the gear, scroll down to the keyboard, then the top setting. Pros: -The fingerprint sensor/power button is fantastic. It's placed perfectly, works fast, and has just the right feel. -Camera button, which is sadly a dying feature. The quick-launch ability alone makes it worth having.. Was this review helpful to you?. Was promoted as waterproof but it NOT waterproof. Do not dunk it in water, it will die. I had so many overheating issues with this too. 2.0 out of 5 stars Good everything but NOT waterproof.

This review isn't for the phone itself but is meant to be a warning about phone reception in the Seattle area on T-Mobile with this phone. 3.0 out of 5 stars If you have T-Mobile and live in the Seattle area, I can't recommend this phone. I move from my htc one m7 and I was looking for a smaller phone. This is one of the only small phones that runs android. That said be prepared to make a lot of sacrifices. 3.0 out of 5 stars Mediocre at best. been using for more than a year now and its dependable but like everything it has its downside but it has served me well, dependable. 4.0 out of 5 stars good and dependable. Always bought Sony (Ericsson) and I am glad they eventually caught up with their smartphones. 4.0 out of 5 stars Love this phone. This shopping feature will continue to load items.

The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact is a no-compromise compact phone that features the top of the line Snapdragon 810 system chip and the ultra-fast 23-megapixel Exmor RS camera that the Xperia Z5 family has. The Z5 Compact sports a 4.6-inch 720 x 1280 pixel (HD) display and is actually narrower than phones like the iPhone 6, but it's also a fairly bulky phone. We're happy to see that it also packs a fingerprint scanner built in the side positioned lock screen.. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Review Sony Xperia Z5 Compact manual Sony Xperia Z5 Compact benchmarks.

IP certified - The IP code indicates the degree of protection against dust and water. The first number represents dust protection, while the second represents water protection. In IP67, for example, 6 means a completely dust-tight device, while 7 means the device can stay immersed in up to 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes. In IP68, a higher level of water protection is expected, but exact numbers aren't specified: both depth and continuance are specified by the manufacturer on per device basis..

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running..

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Sony Xperia Z5 Compact review | TrustedReviews. A solid day and a half of battery life. 4.6-inch 720p HD LCD screen (323ppi). Snapdragon 810 processor with Adreno 430 GPU. What is the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact?. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact – Design. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact – Screen. The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact is the smaller sibling to the Xperia Z5 and the 4K-screen packing Z5 Premium. It’s also the successor to the Xperia Z3 Compact , retaining the same 4.6-inch 720p HD screen in a water-resistant body. As is the case with its predecessor, Sony includes as many of its high-end features as it can into the smaller frame. So you get the same great camera, 64-bit Snapdragon 810 processor powering performance and the ability to shoot 4K video just like you can on the Z5. SIM-free, the Z5 Compact costs around £450, which is £100 cheaper than the Z5. On the face of it, if you’re happy to make some compromises with the design and screen quality, then Compact has plenty going for it. However, I found that the longer I’ve been living with it, the more niggling issues I discovered.. In recent years, Sony has stuck firmly to its “Omnibalance” design philosophy. When the Xperia Z launched in 2013, it was refreshing to see a handset that was so different from what the likes of Apple, Samsung, LG, HTC were bringing to market. Those same eye-catching elements introduced back then have trickled down into Sony’s other handsets, including the Z3 Compact. The Z5 Compact offers a frosted-glass finish on the back and front of the phone, which, although feels very much like plastic to touch, makes a welcome change from the slippery tempered glass used on last year’s phones. For anyone who’s owned a Z3 or a Z3 Compact, you’ll know all about how the issues of that glossy back, especially if you like resting your phone on the armchair of your sofa or any soft material surface. Measuring in at 8.9mm thick compared to the Z5’s slender 7.3mm profile, the Z5 Compact is a far chunkier phone. In fact, it looks the handset’s back and sides are sporting a bumper. Unlike the Z5, these sides are made of plastic, rather than the more luxurious metallic finish.. In white, I can’t help but feel that the Z5 Compact looks like a toy. There are few companies that have successfully delivered an attractive white phone; you can add Sony to the group that doesn’t quite pull it off. The good news is that the Z5 Compact is also available in black, yellow and red – and I’d be inclined to go for one of these over the white.. Related: Sony Xperia Z6 release date. The buttons and ports are positioned in pretty much the same place you’ll find them on the Z5.. The Compact moves the nano-SIM and micro SD card slot further down the left edge of the phone, next to a small gap where you can attach a lanyard. Elsewhere, it’s an identical layout to the Z5.. Thankfully, you still get a dedicated camera button, which is handy for taking photos in landscape mode. Plus, the larger, side-mounted home button now includes a fingerprint sensor. To set it up, head into the phone’s security settings and follow the process, which involves placing your finger on the power button and lifting it off when you feel a vibration..

While I found Sony’s fingerprint sensor better positioned than Apple’s Touch ID sensor and Samsung’s fingerprint tech, it was a little more temperamental in operation. You’ll need to be very precise when wrapping your finger around that button. Sony remains one of the few companies to offer such protection: its IP68 certification means it’s technically dust- and water-proof to a depth of 1.5m for up to 30 minutes. Except Sony doesn’t want you to take your phone into the water, as the company bizarrely advised its customers recently. The Z5 Compact certainly isn’t an ugly phone or an uncomfortable phone to use, but in many ways it just isn’t as nice as the Z3 Compact. The Z5 Compact sticks with the same 4.6-inch 720p HD panel as its predecessor – and the LCD screen is scratch-resistant too. Although this means it might not be as impressive as its bigger brother for watching films and playing games, overall there are few areas in which I can pick holes. Saying that, resolution is something that needs addressing. Is it time for Sony to upgrade to a Full HD display? There are a number of significantly cheaper phones out there sporting 1080p screens – although few similar-sized phones offer a resolution higher than 720p HD. It’s arguable whether the benefits of the extra resolution are as noticeable as they are on an 5-inch screen or above.. The increase in pixel density from 319ppi on the Z3 Compact to the 323ppi here does result in sharper screen quality and improved clarity. In addition, Sony includes its now standard Bravia TV-inspired display technologies such as a Triluminious display, X-Reality Engine and Bravia Engine 2.. The bottom line is that the Z5 Compact’s screen is exceptionally bright, offers great contrast and accurate colours. Out of the box, colours can look a touch oversaturated and won’t be to everyone’s liking. However, Sony does offer a way to address this: head to the Display setting, where you can adjust white balance and turn off the image-enhancement options, which can overdo it with vibrancy. Viewing angles on the Z5 Compact are solid as well, and it offers great visibility in bright sunlight; Sony’s adaptive contrast technology aids the ability to view and read the screen at day or night..

Good build, it's waterproof Decent camera Capable chipset performance Great battery life. Colors can be off It's thick Display bezel too large. Unfortunately, those wanting a small but powerful Android smartphone are stuck with the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact. It's the only option on the market. Fortunately, it's a good device, a smaller version of a decent Android flagship.. While other manufacturers have mostly given up on creating compact versions of their flagships, Sony has positioned itself as a leader in this niche by reducing only the size of the handset, but not the hardware specs. Case in point, the Xperia Z5 Compact, which is as powerful as the ‘big’ Sony Xperia Z5 , just more “compact.” This makes the Z5 Compact the only sub 5-inch flagship smartphone on the market today.. To be precise, the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact features a 4.6-inch HD screen, and this detail represents the biggest difference between the Compact and Xperia Z5, which has a 5.2-inch Full HD display. In addition, the smaller phone has 2GB of RAM instead of 3GB, its entire edge is plastic, not plastic and metal, and it comes with a physically smaller battery, 2700 mAh compared to 2900 mAh.. The device has a Qualcomm octacore Snapdragon 810 chipset, a very powerful 23-megapixel rear camera, 5.1-megapixel selfie-camera and Android 5.1.1 (Lollipop) with the slight Xperia UI. The Z5 Compact is very similar to the full-sized Z5 and therefore shares a lot of the pros and cons, but does all of this in a smaller and cheaper body.. The new Xperia Z5 Compact is not visually that different from its predecessor Xperia Z3 Compact. Sony has not forsaken its square design, but has emphasized the minimalism of its keys. The device almost looks identical from all angles. What Sony has done, just like with the standard Z5, is worked on the handset’s finish, thus it comes with a matte glass cover which offers exceptional protection. In addition to modern design, this results in a premium look, despite its compact dimensions.. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact back panel. Interestingly, the entire rim of the Xperia Z5 Compact is made out of plastic. Only the edges are plastic on the larger model, Xperia Z5, while all four sides are metal. It was clearly not necessary to. reinforce the body’s construction with metal on the smaller smartphone, which might give users the feeling that this device won’t survive a fall. But this is not the case. A single material build gives the Z5 Compact a cleaner look.. Of course, such a compact device feels comfortable when held in hand and everything is within a thumb’s reach on the display. It weighs 138 grams (4.97 ounces), which is slightly heavier than the previous model and its dimensions are 127 x 65 x 8.9 mm (5.0 x 2.56 x 0.35 inches). Although it is narrower and shorter than the Xperia Z5, it is evidently thicker, but again, this does not change the feeling of outstanding elegance and modern design.. The display-to-front surface ratio of 68.9 percent is somewhat smaller than on the previous model, but this is not evident unless you focus on the display rims. The front is ‘cleaner’ than on the Xperia Z3 Compact, given that the stereo speaker perforations blend into the upper and bottom parts of the phone. There are no physical keys under the display, while Sony’s logo, the LED signal and the front 5.1-megapixel camera are located above the screen.. There is a neck lanyard loop on the left side, along with a cover which hides the nanoSIM and microSD card slots. The right side holds the power key with the fingerprint scanner, located in the middle, while the exceptionally slim volume rocker and the camera key sit above it. The camera key is particularly useful for taking shots under water (yes, the Z5 Compact is waterproof), when it is not possible to shoot by touching the display. The audio jack is located on the upper side with the secondary microphone for ambient noise reduction, while the lower side holds the primary microphone and a microUSB slot with a waterproof coating. This means that users do not have to open a cover when they wish to recharge their phones, as was the cases with all previous Xperia models.. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact power button. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact edge design. Naturally, the display size and resolution are different between the Xperia Z5 Compact and the Xperia Z5, but the craftsmanship technology and the imaging quality these two handsets offer are the same. The Xperia Z5 Compact brings HD resolution (720 x 1280 pixels) on a 4.6-inch diagonal, resulting in a 323 pixel per inch, compared to 428 ppi featured on the larger model. The difference is moot, given the human eye finds it difficult to spot the difference in imaging sharpness greater than 300 ppi. Everything looks very sharp on the Xperia Z5 Compact’s display, without any visible pixelization. HD resolution is perfectly suitable for a 4.6-inch screen and it is a good thing that Sony has not chosen a greater resolution just to have impressive figures, because it would only additionally burden the chipset and battery.. However the Compact shares many of the same imaging problems with the Z5, The contrast is very sustainable, but shifts a bit to the dark side. The Xperia Z5 Compact displays exceptionally dark black tones, but not exceptionally bright white tones. The vivacious part of the spectrum looks bright and intense, while colder tones are a bit washed out. In the end, this results in very cheerful imaging of colorful contents, like games, but dimmer imaging of more serious content. Keeping this in mind, Sony has added the option of manual calibration of the red, green, and blue color components through its settings, which no other rival offers.. The IPS display comes with all Sony-patented technologies, like the Mobile BRAVIA 2 Engine, Triluminos and X-Reality Engine, which makes imaging maneuvers rather flexible. These specs give the Z5 Compact wider viewing angles and the display holds up even when exposed to direct sunlight..

Samsung Galaxy S6 review: the iPhone killer. Motorola Moto G (3rd Gen) review: the best budget smartphone just got better. Sony’s latest update to its “no compromise” smaller flagship smartphone proves size really isn’t everything with three-day battery, top-spec features and a great camera.. While the rest of the market has been stretching phone screen sizes, Sony has been offering smaller “Compact” phones since 2013 fitting the same processor and camera from its larger flagship phones into a more manageable size.. The Xperia Z3 Compact was an excellent phone with over two-days battery life. The Xperia Z5 Compact promises something very similar.. This review was conducted using a near-final prototype. Although unlikely, some aspects may be different to the device that goes on sale.. Sony’s minimalist design has reached its natural conclusion with the Z5 Compact. Some will like it, others will not.. The plain plastic sides and glass front and back feel and look basic – a step back compared to last year’s model. The phone is also relatively chunky for a flagship smartphone at 8.9mm thick. Its larger 5.2in brother the Xperia Z5 is 1.6mm thinner and its predecessor was just 8.6mm thick , but it is markedly thinner than the 11.6mm Motorola Moto G .. Its size makes it feel really nice in the hand. With a reassuringly solid build, easy to reach power button and front-facing speakers that aren’t blocked by hands: there’s no doubt this is one of the easiest smartphones to use.. Call quality is excellent but the volume buttons are quite low down on the right-hand edge making them relatively difficult to reach while holding the Z5 Compact in a secure grip.. The 4.6in screen has relatively low resolution at 720p with a pixel density of 319 pixels per inch (ppi). It is colourful and bright, but not quite as pin-sharp as some rivals with much higher pixel densities in excess of 400 or 500ppi .. The Z5 Compact is waterproof to IP68 standards, but still has an exposed headphones port and microUSB port, meaning there’s no need to struggle with fiddly doors during normal use.. The Xperia Z5 Compact has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor as the Z5 and performs similarly. I did not experience any undue heat issues, and the Z5 Compact seemed cooler overall than its bigger brother.. It wasn’t the fastest feeling Android smartphone I have tested this year, but it was no slouch either. It runs games, image editing software and data-heavy Evernote notes without issue. Only having 2GB of RAM compared to 3GB within the 5.2in Xperia Z5 is not noticeable in daily use.. But what’s really unusual about the Compact is its battery life: it is exceptional. Using it as my primary device, receiving hundreds of push notifications, emails, listening to music via Bluetooth, browsing for a couple of hours and a quick spot of gaming, the Z5 Compact lasted an average of 72.5 hours during my testing without applying any battery saving modes.. Sony claims up to two days battery life but, unlike the larger Xperia Z5 , the Z5 Compact over-delivers. With the excellent Stamina mode enabled I suspect it would last closer to four days between charges.. The Xperia Z5 Compact runs the same software as the Xperia Z5 - a customised version of Google’s Android 5.1 Lollipop.. Sony’s music, movies and album apps are all solid, but can be ignored for Google Photos or similar apps if preferred. High resolution audio playback, digital noise cancelling and access to Sony’s PlayStation Remote Play – all hallmarks of Sony’s recent smartphones – are present.. Users wishing to take advantage of noise cancelling or hi-res music will have to buy the right earphones, although some may come bundled in the box depending on the deal.. For more information on the software see the Xperia Z5 review .. The Xperia Z5 Compacts camera is the same one as fitted to the rest of the Z5 range, and it is great. Autofocus is very fast, images are captured with good detail, video stabilisation is fantastic and a dedicated two-stage camera button is very welcome.. It performs better than average in low-light conditions compared to the high-end competition, although, like the Xperia Z5, the flash is basically not worth using.. The selfie camera produces solid shots in good lighting, but loses detail in in-door lighting conditions. The photos look good zoomed out, but noise is apparent when viewed at full resolution.. The fingerprint scanner hidden under the home button is one of the best in the business. During my testing only once did it fail to recognise my thumb print when trying to unlock the phone. I must have unlocked the phone hundreds of times.. It cannot be used for some third-party apps such as Evernote or LastPass just yet, but that will likely change when fingerprint support becomes standard in Android 6 Marshmallow.. The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact is available for pre-order in black, white, yellow and pink costing £450. For comparison, the 4.7in iPhone 6S costs £539 and the Samsung 5.1in Galaxy S6 currently costs around £400.. The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact is the best smaller Android smartphone of the year and arguably the best smaller smartphone currently available.. The camera is great, the phone is powerful. It’s waterproof and the battery life of three or more days between charges is fantastic. The design will not be to everyone’s liking – it could be thinner and the screen could be of higher resolution, but they are trade-offs worth making.. Pros: three+ day battery life, great camera, microSD card slot, fast, useful software additions, PlayStation Remote Play. Cons: relatively low resolution screen, no wireless charging, selfies soft on detail, chunky design, volume buttons difficult to reach when on a call. © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies. 
more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery and Conclusion. posted by Nick T.. Android - Android + Sony - Sony +. 4 Call Quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction We don’t know about you, guys, but we find great joy in reading old smartphone reviews. They don’t just bring out that warm, soothing feeling of tech nostalgia. They can also be an amusing read – going back to our Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 review , for instance, reminds us that a 4-inch display was considered huge only 5 years ago. The average smartphone has grown in size, and so has its screen diagonal, which now hovers around the 5-inch mark. At the same time, those not ready to accept a smartphone of such proportions must be finding it increasingly hard to come across a truly powerful handset. That’s the kind of folks the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact is made for. While relatively small in size, as suggested by its 4.6-inch screen diagonal, the smartphone packs most of the features and hardware muscle one would get from the brand’s flagship, the Sony Xperia Z5. To be more specific, the Compact is equipped with a top-shelf processor, snaps photos with a 23MP camera, resists water ingress, blasts sound through stereo speakers, and promises great battery life. Not bad for a phone of this caliber, is it? Okay, that’s enough chatter. Let’s take the Xperia Z5 Compact for a spin and see what it has to impress us with. In the box: Xperia Z5 Compact Wall Charger (Output: 5V, 1.5A) Micro USB cable Quick Start guide Design You want a truly compact, pocket-friendly smartphone? Here you go! What is it that makes a compact smartphone compact? Is it that it fits in the smallest of pockets? Or that it fits nicely in smaller palms? Or that it is easy to hold and ideal for use with one hand? Of course, all of these factors are of importance, and the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact does tick most of the right checkboxes. It is a very pocket-friendly phone and one highly suitable for single-handed use. Furthermore, folks with palms of smaller size will enjoy handling Sony’s petite handset – we did confirm this with a couple of lady friends. But the phone’s shape has a negative impact on ergonomics. You see, when it comes to smartphones, Sony’s current design language favors flat surfaces, straight lines, and rectangular shapes. From a purely visual standpoint, there’s nothing wrong with that – a phone built around these principles has a classy, professional, timeless look. This applies to the Xperia Z5 as well. But on the flipside, the edges and corners of the Xperia Z5 Compact have barely any roundness to them and don’t feel nice against the palm. That’s not too big of a deal, but we had to mention it. Size and shape aside, the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact is built within a plastic frame, with glass covering its front and back sides. The back, in particular, is made of what Sony calls frosted glass, and one should think of it as glass treated to a matte finish. There’s a benefit to choosing the latter over regular, glossy glass: fingerprints don’t stick to the back’s non-reflective surface. But on the downside, some folks will find the finish too slippery. It might not look like it, but the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact comes with a pair of front-facing stereo speakers. The good news is that their openings – barely noticeable slits between the frame and glass panel – don’t spoil the looks of the phone in any way, as it was the case with the Xperia Z3 Compact. There’s another noteworthy perk that sets the Xperia Z5 Compact apart from most other smartphones – the handset carries an IP65/68 certification, meaning that it is resistant to dust and water damage. However, while the Z5 Compact will survive accidental spills and being caught in the rain, you are strongly discouraged to submerge the phone completely underwater, especially if it is of the salty kind. In fact, improper use will invalidate your warranty. In any case, you must ensure that the cover protecting the SIM and microSD card slots is firmly in place, as that’s what stops dust and moisture from entering. Thankfully, no flap is needed for the Micro USB port at the phone’s bottom. On the right side of the Xperia Z5 Compact reside all of its physical buttons – a power key in the middle, a volume rocker beneath it, and a 2-stage camera shutter. Disappointingly, these have not been designed well. The power button is soft, and accidental presses were common in our experience, but the volume controls are even more annoying. The volume rocker is just tiny and operating its buttons feels like pressing a sponge. On top of that, the rocker can’t be reached comfortably due to its awkward placement. At least the camera button works fine. It comes in handy while shooting photos, and long-pressing it will launch the camera from any screen. Speaking of buttons, the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact has a fingerprint scanner built into its power key. Naturally, its main purpose is to replace your lock screen and it does a good job at that. The scanner is fast and reliable, with a very high rate of successful readings. Due to its placement, however, the scanner is less convenient to use when the Z5 Compact is held in the left hand. Display The screen gets the job done, but we were expecting better quality given the phone’s price. The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact comes with a 4.6-inch IPS LCD display. By today’s standards, that’s a screen size below the average, and that on-screen buttons eat up precious space does not make things any better. On one hand, there’s nothing holding you back from playing a game of Need for Speed or watching an episode of Voltron on a Z5 Compact. But on the other, these and other activities are more enjoyable on a bigger screen. When chatting, for instance, the on-screen keyboard occupies more space than the actual text conversation. Although the UI is also to blame for this imperfect experience. We’re not saying that a 4.6-inch screen is too small or impractical. It just has its obvious limitations when compared to larger offerings. Those demanding a compact phone, however, should do just fine with what the Z5 Compact has to provide. In terms of resolution, the Z5 Compact’s display packs 720 by 1280 pixels, which translates to a density of 319 pixels per inch. The screen that Sony went for is sufficiently clear and crisp, which makes it perfectly usable. However, it would have been nice seeing a screen of higher resolution in its place, seeing that this is a rather expensive phone we’re dealing with. On the plus side, lower resolution means better gaming performance. Sony could have paid more attention to color accuracy. Our display measurements show that the Xperia Z5 Compact’s screen has a color temperature exceeding 9000 kelvins, and that’s quite far from the reference mark of 6500K. The screen appears blueish because of that. And the delta E figures, which indicate the screen’s accuracy across the color spectrum and grayscale range, are average at best. It is nice that color accuracy can be tweaked from the settings menu, but we don’t see many Z5 Compact owners actually doing that. Where the Z5 Compact truly shines, however, is in the brightness category. With a peak output exceeding 700 nits, the phone’s screen is one of the brightest around, which explains why outdoor visibility has never been an issue during the weeks we spent testing the phone. Before we move on, we must mention that the Xperia Z5 Compact remains usable even when its screen or your fingers are wet. There’s also a Glove Mode, which can be triggered manually, but if you don’t plan on actually using the phone with gloves on, we’d recommend you to leave the feature off. Having it on results in frequent accidental taps when the phone is used with bare fingers.. 5 x 2.56 x 0.35 inches. 127 x 65 x 8.9 mm. 5.44 x 2.64 x 0.28 inches. 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm. 5.65 x 2.78 x 0.27 inches. 143.4 x 70.5 x 6.8 mm. 5.75 x 2.83 x 0.29 inches. 146 x 72 x 7.3 mm.

The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software..

(Posts: 2840; Member since: 19 Jun 2012). posted on 20 Nov 2015, 09:53. what did you expect? even when the Z3 Compact had almost TWICE the battery life of the iPhone 6, according to their benchmarks (from that time), it wasn't enough to make PA write something credible and unbiased... iPhone reviews are always filled with "Cons" (and missing a few more) but those seem to not matter at all regarding the final Rating... in comparison the Xperia Compact line tend to have fewer "Cons" but with bigger consequences to the final rating... I will wait for the comparison review at GSMArena if they decide to make one this year....

Nice to see that PA finally got a regular Sony 1.5A charger... perhaps they can re-test Z3/Z3C charging time as well and they will see that it is Average time and not the +3 hours that they previously measured... Biased review as always so I won't bother pointing out the flaws, but regular readers will know... Anyway this is still the best compact device to get right now, along with the iPhone 6s....

What a great master piece of a phone and dedign by Sony , just let down by no Carl-Zeiss and Xneon flash, and 4gb Ram,. (Posts: 1099; Member since: 05 Oct 2015). posted on 21 Nov 2015, 08:07.

"But if compact size is not of utmost priority, perhaps you might want to spend your money on something else – a proper Android flagship, perhaps, or why not even an iPhone?". (Posts: 2840; Member since: 19 Jun 2012). posted on 20 Nov 2015, 10:03. Call me when current "proper" Android flagships or even iPhones have Waterproof bodies, a proper fingerprint scanner location (I am lefty and this location is perfect for everyone, Left Index finger or Right Thumb), eyelet for landyard, stereo speakers, great battery life (even with 35 minutes less than predecessor), expandable memory, FM radio, Noise Cancelling headphone jack... I recently bought the NC31EM headphones and I tested against Bose QC in a Bose store and I couldn't hear any difference between the two... so saving $250 for similar quality and nolise cancelling is AWESOME, with the only downside is that it will not have noise cancelling with other devices.

I do understand that it gets 7 out of 10 but compared to other phones (uhm iphone6) this should be just as high. But let's face it, website which give phones a number aren't that good. It's more of a race on the same standard grounds without any points for something original and new and mostly biased towards certain phones.

"The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact is quite the unusual handset. It promises flagship-worthy features in a tight, compact package, and there’s still plenty of folks looking for that kind of phone". So Are You Saying The iPhone 6/6s Is Unusual? And Millions Of People Are Looking For Compact Phones. Just Look At The Sales Of The iPhone 6/6s.

"In terms of resolution, the Z5 Compact’s display packs 720 by 1280 pixels, which translates to a density of 319 pixels per inch... However, it would have been nice seeing a screen of higher resolution in its place, seeing that this is a rather expensive phone we’re dealing with.". "4.7 inches, while the resolution is also unchanged – 750 x 1334 pixels. This may not seem like much, compared to the 1080 x 1920- and 1440 x 2560-pixel screens used by some Android phones, but in reality, it leads to a pixel density of 326 ppi, which is still a very high number even by today's computing standards.". In both reviews is mentioned the advantage of the lower resolution on battery and performance, but it is clear that while for Sony is "Meh, I don't like the low resolution", for Apple is "it isn't class leading, but it doesn't need to, because it's awesome".

You cant adjust the greyscale, and the calibration as a whole, changing the color temperature won't solve the utter terrible calibration, also the displays are very grainy as always they got bad displays, i don't know who is the idiot who push the X-reality or whatever their TV BS is implemented. iPhone does not need sliders, becasuse at worst their display have very good accuracy, much better viewing angles, they do not suffer from gamma/contrast shift - and the terrible grainy effect, they also got decent white balance 6500-7000K..

All these screen display measurements mean absolute nothing. What matters is real life quality, i can send u tons of reviews showing both displays side by side and no reviewer picked the iphone display ahead of the z5. They both render accurate colours but the z5 is punchier like an amoled screen and brighter as well. Stop all this crap talk of grainy, u have never tested a sony phone in your life talkless of owning one.

Sony's new small form phone is the hidden gem of the Xperia Z5 range - it's just a shame there isn't a Full HD screen.. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact price Price has dropped since launch to £350, $400 (around AU$580) Design Traditional Xperia styling at a palm-friendly size Frosted glass rear provides premium appeal. Update: It's now quite difficult to find the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact on sale because the company is focusing its small phone attention on the newer Xperia X Compact. If you're after a smaller phone from Sony, be sure to check that more recent device out.. The Xperia Z5 Compact stands alone: Sony is the only Android manufacturer making a small high-end phone right now.. Like the Xperia Z3 Compact before it, the Xperia Z5 Compact puts an impressive array of features comfortably into the palm of your hand, and makes you wonder why no other brands are interested in this niche.. Not everyone wants a giant phone, and who could be blamed for wanting to use their whole screen without needing both hands?. The Xperia Z5 Compact sits alongside two other phones from Sony. There's the Sony Xperia Z5 , which offers a 5.2-inch 1,080p screen and 3GB of RAM that you don't get here. Then there's the Xperia Z5 Premium , which will be here in November with a 5.5-inch screen and a 4K resolution screen.. These have since been superseded by Sony's new X line of handsets, including the Sony Xperia X Compact - although it fails to hit the same heights as the Z5 Compact.. Weight : 138g Dimensions : 127 x 65 x 8.9mm OS : Android 5.1.1 (upgrades to Android 6) Screen size : 4.6-inch Resolution : 720 x 1280 CPU : Snapdragon 810 RAM : 2GB Storage : 32GB Battery : 2,700mAh Rear camera : 23MP Front camera : 5.1MP. One early problem was the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact price. High-end specs require a high-end price, even if the reduced frame might lead purchasers to expect a bargain.. At launch the Xperia Z5 Compact price was £429 in the UK (about AU$710) – but since launch that's dropped and it can now be picked up SIM-free for as little as £350 (around AU$580).. Meanwhile, in the US the Z5 Compact unlocked now retails for $400 - down from $500 at launch. It's not available via popular US carrier subsidies, which will blunt its success.. It's now quite difficult to find a store selling the Xperia Z5 Compact, but the price may be even lower if you do find a retailer stocking the aging phone. If you can't find this phone, we'd recommend checking out our guide to the best compact phones out right now.. The Xperia Z5 Compact follows closely the excellent design established by the Xperia Z5. It isn't drastically smaller than the Z5 – the Compact is 127 x 65 x 8.9mm, compared to 146 x 72 x 7.3mm. But it's enough to make a difference.. The Xperia Z5 Compact has lost a lot of the bezel space that felt so redundant on the Z5, and feels a lot more concise than its bigger sibling.. You might have noticed that the Z5 Compact is actually bigger than the Z5 in one dimension: it's a little thicker.. That's to fit in all those high-end specs and a bigger battery than the larger phone. I barely noticed the difference in thickness until I put them next to each other, and even then it wasn't all that shocking.. The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact weighs in at 138g, 16g lighter than the Z5. Build wise, it's a similar size and weight to the iPhone 6S.. The back panel is much nicer on this new version of the Compact model. Instead of the clear glass back from previous handsets, it's now a frosted glass that feels good against the palm and looks stylish.. Colour options are white, black, yellow or coral – I was able to use all versions but the white for this review. The black version feels the most stylish, while the yellow and coral are particularly bright. They wouldn't be my choice of phone, but for those who liked the colour-pop aesthetic of the iPhone 5C, they're perfect.. The corners have been rounded off even further on the Xperia Z5 Compact than on the Z3 Compact, making it a much more comfortable fit in the hand.. The anti-break bumpers of the Xperia Z5 aren't included here, so the Compact is more likely to shatter if it falls on one of the four corners. It's unclear why Sony made this decision – they would have been easy to implement, and would make a big difference to the durability of the phone.. At the top of the left hand edge of the phone, there's the indented Xperia logo, which actually looks good this time around. On the bottom of that edge is the only flap on the handset, covering the microSD and nanoSIM slot.. It's easier to open this up than it has been on previous Xperia phones, and as you'll only need to on the rare occasions that you're swapping a SIM or microSD.. In the centre of the bottom edge sits the micro USB port for charging and data transfer. It's a shame that Sony hasn't moved on to USB-C to minimise fumbling when plugging in, but at least the inconvenience of the flap has been removed.. And Sony isn't behind the pack on USB standards, even if it would have been nice for it to get ahead. In a few years, smartphones will have moved on and USB-C will become the norm, but for now most still use micro USB.. The 3.5mm headphone jack sits at the top of the phone on the left hand side, which is the best place for it as it means the phone can sit in your pocket while you use a wired headset. At the bottom of the right hand edge is the camera button, in the perfect position for taking landscape shots. Just above that is the volume rocker, which has been moved since the Xperia Z3 Compact. This relocation is less successful, and some fumbling is required to reach down to it.. It would have been to put the volume rocker just above the power button on the same side, but at least it's not as bad as it is on the Xperia Z5. On the larger phone it's really hard to reach and the handset flips out of the hand easily.. The power button itself sits flush with the design. This is metal with the on/off symbol engraved on it. It looks good, but the exciting part is that this now features the fingerprint scanner – a new addition to the Xperia Z series, except in the hobbled US variant.. On the front of the phone, there are bezels above and below the display to house the front-facing speakers, microphone and front-facing camera. These are thinner on the Xperia Z5 Compact than on the Xperia Z5 and that means a better screen-to-body ratio.. Next Page Display and key features.

Sony announced the news over Facebook. and confirmed that the device will be available unlocked, supporting GSM networks, for an asking price of US$499.99. You will be able to pick one up through Amazon, Best Buy and B&H.. In an as yet inexplicable move, Sony has decided to remove the fingerprint scanner from the Z5 Compact for its US release. The decision to remove one of the device's most notable features has been described by Sony as a " business decision ", which is about as vague as explanations come.. We've reached out to Sony for further comment, and we will update this page if they provide more information on the move.. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact design and build quality. The new Xperia Z5 is housed in plastic. The volume rocker is placed a little lower on the Z5 Compact. The Z5 Compact offers MicroSD card support. Sony’s Compact devices have a reputation for eschewing. the 'Mini' or 'Lite' phone tradition of being a low-cost,. lower quality version of their flagship cousins. cost about the same as the larger Xperia Z handsets and maintain many of the same high-quality components. The key difference is the size.. The Xperia Z5 Compact specs are similar to the Xperia Z5, but the same cannot be said of the design. While the Z5 comes in sleek, aluminum frame, the Z5 Compact arrives in a cheaper-feeling plastic shell with a frosted glass rear.. feels lower-quality than its predecessor, especially as it's no longer partially-transparent. On our test device, the front and rear glass plates are not equidistant from the frame – on the back of the phone,. there's a gap between the glass and the frame on the left side and bottom, while it's flush at the top and right. Pay close attention to this if you are considering buying the Z5 Compact.. Despite the use of plastic, the Z5 Compact. is marginally heavier than its predecessor, the Xperia Z3 Compact. (139 g compared to 129 g), but otherwise the dimensions are roughly the same. 127 x 65 x 9 mm,. the Z3 Compact is 127.3 x 64.9 x 8.64 mm.. Many of the Z5 Compact’s other design features echo the Z3 Compact, with only a few changes to the hardware features. The front camera and proximity sensor have switched sides and the speakers have now migrated to the top and bottom edge of the handset, but it’s still instantly recognizable as an Xperia Z device.. On the right side is the Xperia Z5 Compact power button, which is now an oval shape and doubles up as fingerprint reader. This can be used to unlock the device, like on the Samsung Galaxy S6 and iPhone 6. below the power button closer to the camera trigger on the side.. whether you are right or left-handed.. Your thumb naturally wants to rest higher on the device, and moving the phone around in your hand. just to adjust volume soon becomes. The new position of the camera lens,. the far left of the back of the. to accidently cover the camera sensor with a finger while. Like all device in the Xperia Z series, the Z5 Compact is dustproof and waterproof to IP65 / 68 certification. What’s more, it can be operated even when the screen is wet or underwater – something that was difficult with. The Xperia Z5 Compact has a slightly disappointing HD display. Sony has ensured that the device is still usable when the display is wet. The Xperia Z5 Compact has 4.6-inch screen diagonal, making it smaller than the majority of smartphones released by the major Android manufacturers this year. Its display has a mid-range, HD resolution (1,280 x 720) the same as the Xperia Z1 Compact and Xperia Z3 Compact.. This contains 320 pixels per inch, which is less than the bigger, Full HD Xperia Z5, but almost the same as the popular iPhone 6 (326 ppi). Sony's liquid crystal displays are usually associated with superb brightness, but. (noticeably) improved upon since the previous generation. ( Here is Sony’s statement on its display tech .). Sony’s local adaptive contrast display technology is effective, adapting to the ambient brightness of your environment to aid visual clarity. superior solution to 'adaptive brightness', which is offered as standard on Android. Whether in bright sunlight or in deep shade, the screen responds to the environment and remains readable, even when we held the phone at a 30-degree angle.. Overall Sony’s HD display is good. It’s sharp and the color saturation is balanced but I can’t help but wish it had been upgraded to Full-HD resolution. Full-HD media is readily available and it would have improved the appearance of (some) images and videos greatly. Sony’s apparent enthusiasm for high-definition displays (see the Xperia Z5 Premium), and the relatively high price of the Z5 Compact, this is a disappointment.. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact special features. The fingerprint reader Xperia Z5 Compact is combined with the power button. The Xperia Z5 Compact has a fingerprint scanner that you can use to unlock the device, as well as make payments with Android Pay. Sony’s scanner, unlike many of its competitors’, is positioned on the side of the phone, which feels like a more natural place to access it: your thumb will often find its way there automatically.. The Xperia Z5 Compact fingerprint scanner yielded good results in my tests. It's placed in a natural position, the 'wake' gesture works fast without needing the button to actually be pressed, and you can still hold the device securely when using it.. The one downside to the fingerprint sensor is that, unlike the display, it will not work when your thumb is wet.. The Z5 Compact arrives running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. Many of the pre-installed can be quickly removed. The Xperia Z5 Compact is running the same user-interface as the Xperia Z5. It ships with the latest version of Android Lollipop together with the Xperia UI and Sony’s usual bunch of pre-installed apps: Music, Videos, Xperia Lounge, etc, along with Facebook and 11 applications from Google. Sony also includes a radio antenna. Although Sony is testing a UI that's closer to the stock Android experience, this has yet to manifest itself. Still this current version of Xperia remains close to stock Android, meaning Sony is in a position to provide relatively quick updates; particularly useful when security crises such as. Sony has plenty of preloaded apps on the Z5 Compact but most of them can be uninstalled or removed immediately. The most notable Sony apps are Socialife, Lifelog, Smart Connect and Xperia Lounge.. The news app Socialife is well-designed and surpasses many competing apps in its successful implementation of Material Design. As a vertical list of news, its functionality is reminiscent of Google news and weather, but it’s also used to promote Sony products and services.. Lifelog is a fitness tracking app that's. especially useful when combined with a smartband. It measures how much time you have spent doing sports, at work, driving a car or playing video games. If fitness is your thing, Sony’s app is as good as any.. Smart Connect allows you to make simple automations regarding connectivity. You can set it so that plugging in your headset, for example, will launch your favorite music-player app. The Xperia Lounge is Sony’s own marketplace for music or movies, similar to what Google Play and the Amazon Store offer. The most useful apps are Music, Video, PlayStation and Album (the media apps), the contents of which can be viewed and interacted with across other Sony devices.. Other Sony extensions hidden under the hood include ANT +, A-GPS, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC (with One Touch Setup), Micro-USB port (High Speed 2.0) with support for MHL 3.0 and 5-pin, screencasting, DLNA certification, Throw. function (for external media playback ), HDCP, Cast screen, MirrorLink, screen mirroring, Native USB tethering, SmartConnect, and FM radio.​.

In the AnTuTu benchmark, the Z5 Compact reached 84 percent the Galaxy S6's score. The Xperia Z5 Compact runs on a 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor (MSM8994), with four cores running at 1.5 GHz and four at 2 GHz, with the Adreno 430 GPU. Additionally, the Z5 Compact houses 2 GB of RAM (1 GB less than on the Z5 and Z5 Premium) and 32 GB of internal storage, though it supports microSD cards up to 128 GB.. Check out the benchmark results below.. It seems that Sony has learned some lessons from its recent history, and has done a great job of optimizing the OS so that the hardware doesn't overheat, despite the processor being the same as the one in the Xperia Z3+.. If we compare the Z5 Compact to our performance. measurements created for our fastest Android smartphone article, the Z5 Compact lines up somewhere between the Z3+ and the OnePlus Two, both of which are equipped with the Snapdragon 810 processor. certainly not be out of reach for the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact.. Compared to the Z3 Compact (right), the Z5 audio has been much-improved. We pitted Xperia Z5 Compact against the Xperia Z3 Compact to investigate Sony's promise that it had improved the audio quality. We played the same MP3 track, in the same player, with the same audio settings, at full volume, on both devices.. Though the maximum volume was (disappointingly) almost the same, the sound was significantly clearer in the Z5 Compact,. particularly in the low to mid frequencies. The larger Z5 Compact drivers offer far more depth.. However I still wouldn’t recommend the Xperia Z5 Compact as an alternative to a Bluetooth speaker, because,. despite its stereo speaker setup, it’s just not loud enough. Nevertheless, it was a notable improvement over the last device, and call quality and video call quality were also excellent.. Z5 compact, are far better than the bottom-. or rear-mounted single speakers of many modern flagships, the Galaxy S6 and LG G4 included.. The dynamic range in automatic mode on the Xperia Z5 Compact camera. Sony's selection of scenes or shooting modes. The highlighted area marks a 1,920 x 1,080 section of shot taken with the 23 MP Z5 Compact camera. The camera software is the real centerpiece of this year's Xperia generation. The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact camera features a 23 MP Exmor RS Sensor, and a super-fast autofocus of 0.03 seconds.. In bright outdoor shots, the dynamic range is remarkable, displaying huge contrast between light and dark, but also maintaining detail in shade where most competing phones would only show black. The Z5 Compact does tend to distort colors slightly however, edging towards a blue hue, but it makes a. Indoor images should generally be taken with the flash to reduce this.. The default Sony camera app produced some impressive photos, however. In addition, the Z5 Compact camera has what Sony calls a 'hybrid image stabilizer', which helps to decrease the shakiness found in handheld videos.. The continuous autofocus, which automatically changes the focus of an image according to the proximity of the object to the lens, is another highlight of the Z5 Compact camera. The Sony camera sensor recognizes moving objects and makes the adjustments impressively fast. Other current cameras offer this software feature too, but they don’t really compare.. to the Xperia Z5 Compact software, it is now possible to use the augmented reality modes, for example, without the device overheating. Sony's camera app comes with a pool of apps, most of which are 'fun' effects such as the AR-mask, but some are very cool. Time-shift video recording for example, records videos at a higher frame rate and lets you choose a portion of the video to playback in slow motion. It’s not unique to Sony, but it’s a nice addition.. Manual mode for incremental camera adjustments, but I found its automatic mode worked just fine in most circumstances. The results were consistently impressive, and you can see a whole bunch of them in our Xperia Z5 Compact camera review gallery .. The Z5 Compact doesn't die easily. Heavy users can easily use it for a day. No USB Type-C for the Z5 Compact. When testing the Xperia Z5 Compact, I installed all of the apps I normally use, including the notoriously data and power-hungry Facebook app. I set the screen brightness between 60 and 70 percent, so I could easily read it in the office, and made all of the benchmarks and photo examples you can see in this review during the initial test.. After 24 intense hours, with about six hours of screen-on time, the battery was still not depleted. (my Nexus 5 would have died twice in that time). device far more than the average person would have done over the same period and yet it still had. battery performance will dwindle after repeated use,. it seems that Sony still knows how to rock battery life.. According to Sony, the battery of every Xperia smartphone in the Z5 range can last up to two days and one hour. (or almost 50 hours, as a normal person might put it), and supports Qualcomm quick-charge 2.0 functionality. Additionally, the Xperia Z5 battery has been slightly boosted. to 2,700 mAh, compared to its Z3 Compact predecessor’s 2600 mAh capacity.. The Sony Xperia Stamina mode and ultra power-saving mode also make a return. All told, the Xperia Z5 Compact is one of the most energy-efficient smartphones on the mobile market –. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact technical specifications. 127 x 65 x 9 mm. 1280 x 720 pixels (319 ppi). The Xperia Z5 Compact is still one of the only premium 'small' devices. The Sony Xperia Compact line should never be compared to other Mini smartphones. Sony has provided the same CPU, GPU, camera and audio quality as the Premium device in this series, just with a smaller, lower-resolution. the performance is in the same region as any 2015 flagship. and the camera is at the peak of Sony's potential.. When we first reviewed this phone, its price equated to around US$600, we said was "unreasonably high" given the "rapid decline" in Sony's Xperia Compact prices just a few months after their release.. So what about its official US$499 US introductory price?. Well, it's still expensive considering the relatively low-resolution screen, but the. Xperia Z5 Compact is also the best 'small' smartphone in the world .. What's more, unlike the standard Xperia Z5, the Z5 Compact may not see a sequel until the end of 2016.. Ultimately, if you want a flagship standard smartphone that's less than 5-inches tall, you should get the Xperia Z5 Compact.. What are your thoughts on the Z5 Compact? Let us know in the comments.. This article has been updated since it was first published. Comments below may not reflect the current content.. I was so impressed w/ the "Music" quality on the Z3, but so far I can't say the same thing about the Z5. The music quality doesn't have the same punch as my 2014 Z3. I hope Sony can fix this problem in their next "Music" update. I gotta have more cow bell! This should be at the top of Sony's list. And another thing; for some reason my spellcheck doesn't work. Other than that my Sony Z3 was super reliable and I except to be as delighted w/ my new Z5 for the next 2 years'.. nice review bro read this review too more detail about sony xperia z5 compact www.smartphonemagz.com/2016/06/sony-xperia-z5-compact-review-prices-and-specifications.html. Does anyone else find it is slow in taking pictures? I previously had an iPhone and it took the picture immediately. This is delaying about 2-3 seconds enough to miss a moment. You know, i've not read one reviewer praising this phone for it being the best performing snapdragon 810 device due to the 720p screen. The low resolution (but completely reasonable) allows it to perform as good as the iphone 6s in benchmarks. Thats why I actually like this phone, BECAUSE of the 720p screen. It's actually really funny, not 5 years ago 720p was a perfectly acceptable resolution for a computer monitor. With such a small screen, wtf do we need 1080p? Isn't battery life and performance more important? Yeah, it really perturbs me that people are hating on this phone for 720p when it's screen is under 6 inches I couldn't give less of a fuck. Also, 4k camera? Why do we even need that? Loool. Don't know the prices of iphones in your country but in the UK a Sony Z5 compact is far cheaper than an iPhone 6 plus the Sony is far better more storage better camera and far better battery life. I would prefer iphone 6 over it. Xperia z5 compact is more costly than an iPhone now. If it would be around 32000 rupees, i surely consider that. Sony Xperia Z5 is now on sale only on goo.gl/AZUOTD. I did spend $600 dollars on this device and don't regret it at all. I've bought a sane sized phone, not some huge monstrosity that can't fit in my pocket or my hand. I hope other manufacturers realize this and make 'compact' phones that are not neutered like the xperia line.. Currently THE best compact android in the world..... I'm in a bit of should i buy or not? I've a z3compact and it's a brilliant phone, just don't know whether to upgrade to the bigger z5? love some advice now the z5s been out for a bit!. I have bought the z5c forum the excellent battery life (like this and other reviews say) and it's three days i can barely make to 8 pm with my phone :( i have the same brightness as the reviewer and i use my phone mainly for WhatsApp, a check or two on Facebook and a little browsing.... Non (in italy it's 9.30 am) i am already at 84% and it Will be completely drain (as these three past days) around 6 pm....what can i do??? A hard reset? Or is there something i miss!?. I made the upgrade from the Z3C which had excellent battery life. My Z5C on a regular day use is crap compared to the Z3C. Today I took my phone off the charger at noon and by 9:00 pm I was under 20%. I am not a stranger to customization and making sure bluetooth/nfc/gps are off when I don't need them. But still, this phone is making wonder if I should return it because I am super unhappy with the battery results so far.. I'd bring it back to the shop for replacement. I have had this phone for 2 weeks already and I can tell that 2 days is achievable. In stamina mode mine uses about 12% battery in 24 hours if I don't touch it. I have GPS and BT turned off. Mobile data and Wifi are only active when the screen is on. In fact I am amazed at its stamina comparted to my wife's Nokia1020, which barely lasts 10 hours on a charge.. I'm curious: do you get 2 days in stamina mode on under standard mode. Mine lasts a little less than one day, more or less, in standard. With my usage pattern, Z3C used to hold far more than a day. Infact, I will toss the Z5c to my wife and get my Z3C back from her. My plan is to lure her with the finger scanner gadget... And, we should not forget that both - the Z1c and the Z3c suffer from cracked displays and - for the Z3c - cracking glases on the rear side of the phone too, with absolute no waranty from Sony. So IMO its worth to wait several months and follow the reviews on Shopingplatforms if Sony have solved this Problem with the Z5c.. I have to admit myself I'm tempted to wait for the z5, coming from a Samsung user I would prefer battery over screen resolution. Companies are obsessed with getting better screens and still keeping their phones thin, they can put all the power saving devices they want on it, but if you have a powerful screen and your limited to the power of a battery you can put in the handset without affecting the size of the handset then I would prefer a phone that can give me two days worth of power for the sake of a lower resolution/ppi etc. I'm not going to have my eye's right up to the screen or sit and think wow that screen doesn't look as good as other phones, and if anyone else spots it, then i would like to say to them, however whilst I'm still using mine on a night out, you will be sending your last message with something along the lines of "my batteries nearly dead, so if I don't reply then you know why." message. I'm impressed with everything about the Sony z5 and never really had a Sony phone, however I do know they are renowned for good battery life. I'm seriously considering the z5 and tempted not to wait to see what the s7 offers because I really do think there will be a lot of hype, but they won't deliver what people expect or want, I know all companies don't listen to the consumers anyway, but Samsung are terrible for completely blanking there consumers.. Sony Xperia Z5 was being compared to Samsung Galaxy S6 and for me, I will go for Sony Xperia Z5 because it is not na upgrade of an previous model. The features and functions are excellent.. Thing is the performance the phone gets from 720p is much better than 1080P+, you see the iPhone 6 and now the s always on top in performance because of it. You don't notice the resolution at 4.6 unless you look closely, but I do agree that once you notice it, you do feel a bit let down. My problem with the screen though is Sony panels on their phones are always way behind the competition, you look at this and then a GS6 and the quality is so disappointing. The camera is disappointing as well from what I've seen, the processing sucks, Sony really need to support .DNG. The screen is fine its about the same as the Iphone 6s ratio, thats a cheap phone with non demanding users... While I look at photos on the screen, browse the web, use apps and watch the odd video from Facebook or netflix. I don't need 1080p ,720 or whatever it is, will do fine thanks. I have a hi quality TV screen I can Chromecast to thanks. What I do need is a very good camera and if its an improvement on the Z3 Compacts camera then that will do me. The CPU has another power to process things quickly and efficiently. I like Noise cancelling and hi quality music playback with battery life which means I can go away for the weekend and not stress about the battery. Lastly I need a phone which when my wife accidentally splashed water on my Z3 compact just like she did ten minutes ago I don't need to panic in fact I was more worried about the TV remote sitting by it! The Wifes Iphone was splashed with water two weeks back and it required replacement, which cost us in insurance excess and time making the claim, handing the phone in, getting a temporary phone and picking it up. Seriously who the heck sits and watches a compact Mobile Screen and wants a cinema experience? I prefer a phone which gets me though the day and possibly the weekend or even the week in ultra stamina mode. I have had enough of the large high resolution screen Smart phones which die after less than a working day (forget going out for the evening on the same charge). A smart device is only as useful as long as it is working, you can keep your dead due to lack of battery capacity High resolution and I will keep my Low resolution Compact thanks..

Sony Xperia Z5 Compact review: One year on 2. Battery Life, Performance, Camera, Conclusion & Specifications. Great battery life, an excellent screen and superb performance, the Xperia Z5 Compact is Sony's all-time high. Processor : Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810, Screen Size : 4.6in, Screen resolution : 1,280x720, Rear camera : 23 megapixels, Storage (free) : 32GB (22.5GB), Wireless data : 3G, 4G, Size : 127x65x8.9mm, Weight : 138g, Operating system : Android 5.1.1 See all of the best Sony Xperia Z5 Compact deals on uSwitch. 'Plus' looks to have superceded 'Mini' phones these days, making tiny, compact smartphones an ever growing rarity as more and more manufacturers ditch their diminutive flagship spinoffs for jumbo-sized phablet versions. Fortunately, Sony's still firmly ensconced in the Compact camp, even if its latest effort, the rather underwhelming Xperia X Compact was a bit of a disappointment.. This makes last year's Z5 Compact even more attractive. It's the perfect antidote to the prevailing phablet mania, and even a year on it's still a fantastic smartphone that can more than hold its own against its newer competitors.. That's mostly down to it sharing a lot of the same DNA as its big brother, the Xperia Z5 , including its octa-core processor, 23-megapixel camera and flush fingerprint sensor. However, as its name implies, it's all packed into a much more petite chassis and has a smaller display and screen resolution to go with it.. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact SIM-Free Smartphone (UK Version) - Coral. Measuring just 127x65x8.9mm, the Z5 Compact is delightfully easy to hold in one hand, and you don't have to stretch to reach the top or opposite side of the screen. Instead, everything is in easy reach, making a refreshing change from larger screen devices. It is comparatively chunky, and its lightly rounded corners can feel a touch slippery at times, but nothing serious enough to take the sheen off this pleasingly diddy design.. Admittedly, it's a shame the pearlescent reinforced corners of the Z3 Compact have been swapped for a more uniform, matt aluminium frame, but the new engraved Xperia logo in the top right corner of the phone does go some way to help make up for it.. Likewise, I'm a big fan of Sony's new frosted glass effect on the rear of the handset, and the yellow and pink coral models look particularly stylish. Even better, the frosted finish means it doesn't pick up half as many fingerprints as its glossy glass-backed predecessors either, making it look much smarter than its competitors.. Another brilliant new addition is the Z5 Compact's fingerprint sensor, which has been built directly into the power button on the side of the phone. This is a better idea than having it on the back of the phone, as on the Nexus 5X, and it's nowhere near as awkward to use as the home button sensors of the iPhone 6S and Samsung Galaxy S6 .. Instead, it's already in the most natural place possible when you go to turn on the phone, and its support for multiple fingerprints means you can instantly turn it on and unlock it no matter which hand you use to pick it up.. The Z5 Compact is dust resistant and waterproof up to one metre of fresh water for 30 minutes, but its handy capless Micro USB port doesn't need to be covered up if you decide to take the phone for a dip. The only thing you do need to worry about is making sure the plastic flap covering the microSD and Micro SIM card slots is firmly sealed, as you wouldn't want to ruin a 200GB microSD card if you happened to drop the phone down the loo or take it for a dip in the bath. Either way, it comes with 32GB of integrated storage, of which 22.5GB is available to the user, so you should have plenty of space for your music and photos.. As well as being practical, the Z5 Compact's 4.6in 1,280x720 resolution display is one of the best around, as our colour calibrator showed it was displaying an impressive 98.8% of the sRGB colour gamut. This is fantastic for an IPS panel, and it's not far behind the Z5 's nearly perfect 99.4% coverage. It's certainly one of the most accurate displays I've seen in this price range, and it beats the similarly-priced Motorola's Moto X Style by almost 6%.. Colours were beautifully rich and punchy, and there was plenty of detail on show thanks to a contrast ratio of 1,161:1. Admittedly, the screen isn't as bright as the Z5, as I only measured a peak brightness of 461.05cd/m2 as opposed to nearly 700cd/m2. Still, it's perfectly bright enough to use outside, and it also means the Z5 Compact's black levels are much lower than the Z5's as well, coming in at 0.39cd/m2 to deliver deeper, inkier blacks.

The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact currently has an Informr score of 8.2 out of 10.. This score is based on our evaluation of 23. sources including reviews from users and the web's most trusted critics.. What's good Snappy performance for all tasks Over 2 days of battery life during moderate usage Incredibly fast autofocus Highly detailed photos in bright and low light conditions. What's bad 720p resolution display Camera lag issues when navigating app and in-between shots Difficult to adjust to smaller keyboard when typing. While other companies are pushing forward with larger and larger screens, Sony's Xperia Z5 Compact is one of the few smartphones in 2015 that offers a sub 5-inch display. Despite being only 5 inches tall, it manages to be fairly thick at 0.4 inches, leading many experts to call it chunky and chubby. This slight thickness made it feel like a less than premium device to critics, which was only amplified thanks to its plastic sides. With that said, they still found it to be an attractive device thanks to the frosted glass back panel and array of color options. As well, the added thickness and rounded corners provided them with a comfortable fit.. Gracing the front of the Z5 Compact is the petite 4.6-inch, 720 IPS LCD screen. This provides a Retina-like pixel density of 323ppi. While some critics bemoan the fact that it isn't full HD, they all agree it is sharp enough for most people. Still, there are some limitations to this resolution as they were not able to watch some videos at the intended resolution. The screen did deliver in other aspects, however. They describe it as bright with good viewing angles and good color balance. Unlike larger smartphones, they were also able to use the phone one-handed easily. Some reviewers did discover it took them some time to get used to typing on the smaller screen as they had become accustomed to larger ones.. Just because it's small doesn't mean it's underpowered. The Z5 Compact comes with an octa-core processor that consists of four cores running at 1.5GHz for basic tasks and four 2.0GHz cores that kick in during more intensive tasks. This is backed by 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. For the most part, experts experienced fairly snappy performance regardless of whether they were simply browsing the web or playing a 3D game. Thanks to the 2700mAh battery, they were also able to get a full day's worth of life even when leaving 4G on for hours. Moderate usage netted them a whopping 72 hours.. The Z5 Compact comes with the same camera as the Z5. This means a 23MP camera, new autofocus, stronger zoom and optical image stabilization. According to Sony, the camera can autofocus in 0.03 seconds. While experts didn't time it, they were impressed with the incredible speed citing it as one of the fastest they've tested. Bright light situations provided them with detailed shots and excellent contrast between light and dark. Unlike many other smartphones, critics were also able to take excellent pictures in low light conditions as well even without flash. Still, many experts were unsatisfied with the camera due to shutter lag, delay between shots and sluggishness when navigating the app itself.. Experts recommend the Xperia Z5 Compact for people who are looking specifically for a smaller smartphone. Tech Radar states, "If you're looking for a small Android phone right now, this is it. With an incredible battery life, a new high-end processor and some impressive camera upgrades…There's much more to like here than criticize." Android Pit adds, "The Xperia Z5 Compact must be the best 'small' smartphone in the world.". The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact managed to accumulate high marks in just about every category we test for, but the day-to-day experience of using one tells a slightly different story. It takes beautiful photos, but the process of taking them isn't very fun or intuitive. With its powerful processor, good battery life, and solid camera, the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact is a great choice for a one-handed Android device that doesn't trade power for size. It offers more power and better battery life than any of the similarly sized Android competition.. - Know Your Mobile team, Know Your Mobile.

The bottom line is that the Z5 Compact isn’t a great phone, but it is a good one, and it’s also the only game in town if you want something smaller than a typical flagship without sacrificing speed or capability entirely. It’s possible that the release of Apple’s 4-inch “iPhone 5SE” will inspire the other Android OEMs to do some more small-screened experiments, but until that happens, the Z5 Compact is what you want.. Good things come in compact packages. The Sony Xperia Compact line should never be compared to other Mini smartphones. Sony has provided the same CPU, GPU, camera and audio quality as the Premium device in this series, just with a smaller, lower-resolution screen.

Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Review: The Only Small Phone That Matters. 2015/11/30 8:04am PST Nov 30, 2015. News Phone Reviews Reviews Sony Xperia Z5 Compact. 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design 5 Display 6 Fingerprint Sensor 7 Camera 8 Battery Life 9 Software And Performance 10 Conclusion. I remember not that long ago thinking that a 4.7-inch phone screen was pretty large. How could they get bigger than that and still be usable? Surely this is the end of the road... and here we are a few years later and the Xperia Z5 Compact is considered diminutive at 4.6-inches. When I say this phone is small (and it is) I mean it's small compared to every other Android flagship.. Consumers have voted with their dollars and told OEMs they want big phones, leaving the Xperia Compact series as your last bastion of tiny flagship phones.. When a device basically owns a niche, it doesn't have to be amazing, it just needs to. You want a small phone? This is it, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The Z5 Compact is a nice phone.. 23MP rear facing, 5MP front facing. 127 x 65 x 8.9mm, 138g. You want a small phone with powerful hardware? This is it. The fingerprint reader is a nice thing to have, and putting it in the power button is smart. The camera takes excellent photos in most lighting conditions. The oversampling and zoom tricks are rad. The shutter button is a nice touch too. They are surprisingly good for a tiny phone. Roughly 8 hours of screen-on time is doable. The Z5C is solid and the water-resistant design is appreciated. Props to Sony for improving the port cover and making the USB port exposed.. This is a $500 phone that doesn't quite have the specs to match other flagships (eg. You're basically paying a premium because you want a small phone. This is a small con—it gets warm and throttles, but not as badly as some other phones. The power button and volume rocker are too low on the body of the phone to be used comfortably. Sony's phones all have this same boring. It's not an attractive or unattractive phone, it's just... The low-light performance is just okay; somewhat below average. It's a little low on this phone, and recognition isn't as good as some others.. Like most of Sony's phones, the Z5 Compact is a flat rectangle with little in the way of ergonomic niceties. The rear panel is a smooth piece of aluminum (sorry, frosted glass), and the edges are slightly rounded matte plastic. It's still a pretty boxy little device, though. If someone scraped the logos off the Xperia Z5 Compact you'd probably still be able to tell it's a Sony device, and I don't mean that in a particularly good way. It comes in several colors, including black white, yellow, and (like my review unit) pink... I mean, coral (sure, Sony). The overall aesthetics are competent, and that's it.. The Z5C is a little thicker than other flagship phones at 8.9mm, but that's because there's less surface area to lay everything out in. It needs to be a little thicker to accommodate the components. The bezel is pretty narrow at least. The device is small enough that I can get my fingers. around the edges and reach almost the entire screen with my thumb. No uncomfortable stretching or repositioning required. I think this is probably the primary selling point of the phone—it's little.. The Z5 Compact is water-resistant like its predecessors, but there are a few refinements here. For example, Sony now has an exposed microUSB port on the bottom of the phone that's still water resistant. The Z3 Compact had the USB behind the sealed port cover. There's still a port cover on the Z5 Compact (left edge), but it's actually just housing the SIM card and microSD card slot. The flap itself is thick and not too rigid, so I don't feel like I'm going to snap it off when I open it, but you shouldn't have to get in there too much.. All the physical buttons on this phone are along the right edge, and they're a little strange. Around the midpoint is the power button with a built-in fingerprint sensor (I'll get to that later). Below that is the volume rocker, and below that is a camera shutter button. Keep in mind this phone only has a 4.6-inch screen, and the volume rocker is. of the way toward the bottom of the phone, which is not comfortable in the slightest. You have to reposition the phone to change the volume. Even the power button in the middle is a little awkward for me with average size hands. The camera button makes sense as you'll probably be holding the phone in landscape when you use it, so that's the top corner where a shutter button ought to be.. Despite the small footprint, Sony managed to cram in some competent front-facing stereo. They aren't as good as what you get on the Nexus 6P, but they kick the crap out of all those phones with bottom-firing mono speakers. There's very little bass (of course), but the volume goes pretty high and there's very little distortion. The screen is the defining characteristic of the Z5 Compact. It's only 4.6-inches and has a resolution of 720p. In an age of 1440p (and even 4K on the Z5 Premium), a measly 1280x720 resolution doesn't look very impressive on a spec sheet. There are a lot of markets where this phone is a non-starter simply for that reason, but in practice, this is what some users are asking for—a small phone with a screen that won't destroy the battery.. Sony gets away with using a 720p resolution because it's a small panel. The pixel density is 319 ppi, which isn't bad. It doesn't look quite as good as a 1440p panel when you've got one to compare to, but it's not a huge deal in real world usage. The display is right up against the glass and has excellent viewing angles. You can get way off-axis without any color distortion or dimming. The display does get very bright, so it's fine outside. The minimum brightness is nice and low too. I do quite like that it uses the standard Android adaptive brightness mechanic.. Sony is fond of talking up its. Triluminos display technology, which uses a blue LED backlight and quantum dots to produce cleaner colors. The result, according to Sony, is a 50% larger color gamut than conventional LCDs. For an LCD, the colors on this screen do look nice. It doesn't have the same pop as a nice AMOLED, but it looks better than most other LCDs I have around. Sony also has a software processing option called X-Reality for photos and videos. This is accessible in the settings, and bumps up contrast and saturation. The difference seems subtle in most instances.. Everyone's hopping on the fingerprint reader hype train, Sony included. On this device, it's built into the power button, which again, is on the right edge of the phone at about the midpoint. I feel the need to point out again this is a little low for the power button on such a small phone, but having the sensor in the power button is smart. It's a bit like the LG V10 (or GS6, but. You press the button and just leave your finger there for a moment longer to get the phone to unlock.. The speed of the sensor is good, but not supernaturally fast like it is on the new Nexus phones. bad , but I've become accustomed to the quality of the recognition on the Nexus phones, which never seem to misread a print. Those phones have no trouble reading a fingerprint in any orientation, but if you touch the Z5C's sensor at an unusual angle, it's probably going to reject you at least once.. This phone runs Android 5.1 Lollipop, so the fingerprint reader won't have access to the APIs that were introduced as part of Android 6.0. So, apps and Google services won't be able to plug into this sensor, and it won't count as a secure unlock method for Google services. Adding prints to the Z5C also takes a much longer time than it does on phones like the Nexus 6P. When the Z5 Compact gets an Android 6.0 update, this won't be an issue (I hope), but we have no way of knowing when that's going to happen.. Sony makes most of the high-end image sensors used in flagship smartphones these days, but camera performance in its own phones hasn't been a match for the likes of Samsung and LG. This is down to software processing for the most part. The results I'm getting from the new 23MP Exmor sensor seem better than the Z3 family, but there are still a few issues.. The first thing to know about Sony's camera is that while it's 23MP total, the default setting is to capture 8MP images with oversampling in the "superior auto" mode. For most people, this will be the right resolution to shoot in. The software is optimized to take the data for a 23MP 4:3 frame. and render it at 8MP 16:9. This produces better results most of the time with improved dynamic range and colors, at least in my testing.. You can enable full resolution 23MP mode to get more detail, but the software seems to lag a bit when you do this. Maybe you could use full resolution mode if your subject is stationary and you really want to get as much detail as possible. The oversampled mode also allows you to zoom in without losing resolution in the final image, which is really cool. The first set of pics below are all 8 MP, and a few full resolution shots are below.. In outdoor light, the Z5 Compact takes some very nice images. The colors are accurate, detail is great, and image stabilization is good enough (this is electronic rather than optical). The software (in auto mode) keeps the ISO very low for clean images, and the capture speed is snappy. When the light starts to get low, the Z5C aggressively ramps up the ISO to keep things bright, and that causes noise as well. In low-light, we're talking about ISO values between 1500 and 2000. I'm just disappointed in this phone's low light photos after using phones like the Galaxy S6, Nexus 6P, and LG G4. They all seem to do better in low light situations.. I am slightly annoyed that there's not a simple way to turn on HDR mode. The phone is supposed to do this for you in auto mode, but if you know you want to force an HDR shot, you need to flip to manual mode, then change the scene setting. That's a few extra steps than other phones.. Sony says the Z5 Compact can focus on a subject in a quarter second (or 0.03s, depending on the page you're looking at), and there's no fancy laser sensor on the back. In my testing, it is actually surprisingly fast. As soon as you tap on an area of the screen or move the camera, it instantly recognizes the focal point and snaps to it. I'd say it's closer to a quarter second, but it's very reliable.. 23MP shots to compare with above. The physical shutter button is less common these days, but Sony continues to do it. This is a two-stage button, so pressing halfway focuses and the next step snaps a photo. The button is soft enough that you won't jostle the phone too much when taking the pic. Lastly, the Z5C does support some settings in the camera2 API, so you can use a third-party app to get some good shots if you like.. We're used to seeing 3000mAh and higher capacity batteries in flagship phones these days, so what's the deal with Sony only putting a 2700mAh battery in this $500 phone? Well, it doesn't really seem to need a bigger one. as the Z3 Compact, which is good.. 50% left and over 4 hours of usage. 8 hours on a charge is doable.. Sony claims two days of usage, which I think is fair if you use a device lightly. I'm seeing around 4 hours of screen-on time over the course of about two days. With heavier usage, the phone lasts a little over a day with around 8 hours of screen time. Compare that to a Galaxy S6, which gets around 4 hours in a day if you're lucky. That 720p screen might not look as good on the spec sheet, but it doesn't annihilate the battery like a 1440p one does.. Sony also has Stamina Mode, which is a little like Doze in Android 6.0. Apps will be suspended when the phone is asleep, but the system won't recover as elegantly and apps won't get a chance to sync until you wake the phone up. Then there's Ultra Stamina Mode, which disables almost all features other than messaging and phone.. The Z5 Compact supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0, so you can fill the battery up in a snap.. Before we get into the software, I should point out that my little pink review unit is an international model. That means whenever the Z5 Compact does officially come to the US, its software might be slightly different. That said, very little has changed with regard to the Z5C's software compared to past Xperia flagship phones. This is Android 5.1 with a very light skin. The home screen doesn't do anything wacky or ill advised, like for example, adding a completely useless and laggy Flipboard panel to the left most page (looking at you, Samsung). I'm not over-the-moon for Sony's icons, but they're less annoying than I remember them being a year or so ago. The app drawer defaults to a custom/stupidly random layout, but that's a quick fix.. There are several UI decisions that I personally find grating. I'm nitpicky about this sort of thing, but the navigation buttons don't seem to have a consistent scale. Sony has a house icon in the middle for "home" instead of a circle, but it looks slightly too large. That makes the overview button to the right look tiny. Props for putting them in the right order, though (again, looking at you, Samsung). I will also never understand why Sony defaults to bright blue for the status bar color in apps that don't have Lollipop-themed bars. Every other phone uses black, which is much less likely to clash.. The notification drawer is mostly stock, but you have an easily accessible option to change what's shown in the quick settings. Likewise, you can control what shows up in the status bar. Don't want the alarm or Bluetooth icon there all the time? No problem. These are both things that Google added in Marshmallow, but Sony has had them in the last few revs of its software.. So, there aren't a lot of problems with Sony's software, but I can't really think of anything that makes me want to use it over stock Android. The only really distinctive feature built into Sony's Android 5.1 build is the "small app" platform, which lets you open select apps in a floating window. It's interesting in theory, but this screen is so small that it's really pointless to do anything other than full-screen mode.. As mentioned above, the Z5 Compact is powered by a Snapdragon 810 and 2GB of RAM. I'm a little concerned about having only 2GB of RAM in a phone that costs upward of $500. The Nexus 5X only has 2GB, but it's a few hundred dollars cheaper. That said, it doesn't seem to be causing any noticeable performance issues. Apps are staying in memory well and I can play audio in the background while running navigation or browsing the web without anything getting killed. Still, depending on what Sony does with the software going forward, you might wish you had that. The Snapdragon 810 has the potential to be too much for the little Z5C to handle. There were a few phones earlier in the year that didn't run very well with the 810. For example, the HTC One M9 would get hot and throttle aggressively. Sony's own Z3+/Z4 also had heat issues to the point that some Japanese carriers recommended against charging it while it was on. To check for this, I ran some 3D games and benchmarks on the Z5C to stress the Snapdragon chip.. Four benchmarks (left to right) showing thermal throttling of the Z5C. It doesn't overheat as quickly or consistently as the M9 did, but it does start throttling eventually. It's about on par with the OnePlus 2. will slow down, but not immediately and not to the point that it gets unusable. There is a proactive warning when you start a 4K capture the first time that tells you the camera may close unexpectedly if temperatures get too high. In a lot of ways, it doesn't matter whether this phone is perfect or if it stands up to larger flagship phones. It rules the small phone niche right now. All it really has to be is competent for people to buy it, because those people really want a small phone. The good news is that the Xperia Z5 Compact is better than competent. phone thanks to the solid water-resistant design and excellent battery life.. It has its flaws, but none of them are deal breakers—more RAM would be nice, and perhaps the Snapdragon 810 wasn't necessary for a phone that has a 720p display. Still, if you want a sub-5-inch phone, this is the best one out there. It could be substantially worse and still hold that title, though.. Note: Our Xperia Z5 review will be up in a day or two.

Doing doesn't like Americans, or at least they don't like our carriers, which ends up screwing us just the same.. I could live with a phone this size, and because I have the Fallout 4 Pip-boy, I kind of want one. But I live in the US, and thus I'm at the mercy of our carriers. Moving to Japan might be nice, but isn't in the cards for me.. You can buy the international version. It works fine, but no warranty. Presumably a US SKU will show up eventually.. Where have you been? There has been 0 indication that it will be sold in the US. Do you know something we don't? Don't play coy, Ryan. If you do buy the international one, make sure it's from a vendor like Expansys who can process warranty claims should your phone break. I learned the hard way after buying an international LG G4 from a vendor in Singapore and having it break. I shipped it back since they themselves honor the warranty, but it still sucks and is inconvenient.. You can also get the Xperia Z3+ from BH Photo video with a US warranty...not that much different from the Z5.. After getting used to really thin phones, this thing looks thick as a brick.. But it has huge battery for its size, which is great.. The Z3C feels incredibly thinner but its battery is only 100mAh smaller.. I wouldn't call that an incredible difference.. I used the verb 'feels' to convey that the hardware dimensions do not correlate to how the device is experienced.. I don't personally think the Z5C feels that thick in the hand.. 720p is fine for 4.6" screen and 2gb of ram. No one is purposefully buying a 4.6" phone to multitask with an S-Pen dual window like the Galaxy Note. Everything run much smoother on 720p vs 1440p as well.. I would like an affordable version of this, like the OnePlus X, except without being a OnePlus.. The HTC One M7 from 2013 had a 4,7" display and 1080p so there can't be a technical limitation that prevents making a 4,6" 1080p display in 2015. I have a Z1 Compact and I'm not complaining about the resolution, 720p is fine at that size, but Sony has to progress somewhere, most of the hardware on this phone makes it feel like a Z3C+. And I personally have a very bad experience with Sony and battery life, I did buy the Z1C for the better battery life compared to competitors, and that point has become completely invalid since I had to replace the battery myself since it died (which is very impractical, the back cover is glued on). My new battery lasts as long as when the phone was new, but this problem has occurred with severy Z1C's and it makes me question the way Sony implements their batteries (at least make the back cover removeable...).. "This is a small con—it gets warm and throttles, but not as badly as some other phones.". One thing to note is that you can get rid of the blue in the statusbar by simply switching themes. I did that the instant my Xperia phone showed those bright colours: I installed a Lollipop theme which made the navigation buttons change to stock as well.. Maybe they all had the blue status bar? It's weird either way.. Just apply the preinstalled white theme -> problem solved.. That's with the default ones, yep. I had to download one from the interwebz (and reboot to let it change the notification bar for some reason), but I haven't seen ugliness ever since.. Themes also change the navbars buttons.. that's the least offensive one most of the time.. You can also make your own theme and customise the nav buttons yourself. I can't use a theme without it overriding my live wallpaper. Am I missing something? NM, figured it out: Wallpaper > Keep Current in the Theme settings.. "Roughly 8 hours of screen-on time is doable.". ....yeah, I'd certainly say that 8 hours screen-on time is "doable".. I think he's saying that it is possible ('doable') to get 8 hours of sot out of this device.. As in, "it can be done", not "I can live with it".. Yea, but if you are using social media apps like twitter, facebook, instagram and snapchat, you should expect more like 4-5 hours. I haven't been able to get much more. And I don't play any games.. Pity the OEMS don't care about it, it's all about the useless 2K > 5.5" displays now.. The could have bumped it to 1080p though... Seriously, if it was a 1080 amoled, I'd get it in a heartbeat. One could argue that at that display size a higher resolution is almost completely unnecessary.. But that's what makes the interwebs nice sometimes. $500 should get you a better screen.. With that ludicrously long battery life. It wouldn't have been a sacrifice, could have been removed from the negatives column :). Better screen at the cost of battery life and performance.. I'll just paste here what I wrote in another comment:. The pixels are not visible unless your eye is one inch away from the. display (which you shouldn't practice if you value your eyesight), so. I agree on the OLED part though, I would love that tech in a phone like this.. I suppose :) OLED is such a determining thing though. The difference between the OP2 and the 6p is nuts, and now having the OPX, it's shocking.. I know, right? I've not seen any panel produce such blacks and colors so bright and fun. (Speak of over-saturation all you will, it feels fun.). Sony and Panasonic are planning to produce their own JOLEDs. Maybe the Xperia phones will benefit from the joint venture.. Though judging from the reports, H2 2017 will mark the start of mass production of 10"+ panels so phones will have to wait I guess.. Or if you use it in conjunction with Google Cardboard. Then again, I'd say the time the phone spends inside the Cardboard housing is probably less than 1% of the time it spends outside.. I saw no practical difference between my Nexus 4 and 5.. Just look at my comment, 1080p in a 4.6" could be a disadvantage.. I had the Z3C and can definitely vouch for 720p being totally acceptable for 4.6". A 1080p panel would only shorten the battery life and have a ludicrous PPI that isn't even necessary for the general consumer. Its not like the average person is going to give two craps about the panel so long as the screen looks good, legible, and all that.. It's on-par with the iPhone 6.. but it's slightly bigger than the iPhone 5 :). The smaller the screen the less res needed as the PPI is higher. I often remote my PC which is at 1080p. I like my phone to have the same native resolution for that reason.. They could have, but why would they need to? Sony have stuck with 1080p on the Z5 and it is a great display, 720p was perfectly acceptable on the Galaxy S3 which was just 4.8".. At 4.6" and 319 ppi, 720p is just fine. Especially a 720p screen of this quality.. That's BS to have to pay a premium for less phone. I was intrigued until I saw the price.... The Snapdragon 810 is the only CPU Sony could use in this case because of the 23MP camera. The image DSP of the 808 for example is limited to 20MP.. The other advantage for Sony is to really have the same platform for all the Z5 family (minus the RAM) so it's more easy to maintain and test. The 720p screen also has an advantage in this particular setting, it uses less RAM for the GPU framebuffer (50% less) even if of course it doesn't completely make up for the 1 gig difference with the Z5 and Z5P. Pretty much every reviewer said Xperia Z5 series has great/excellent camera. Only PA called Z5 series camera's disappointing. I knew they are just trolling and this review just confirms it.. The rave about the phone overall, and they say overall great things about the camera, only noting, fairly, that its low-light performance isn't great and a couple of other caveats worth knowing. Fanboys regard constructive criticism as trolling. Either that or they start a flame war lol.. This is a very good review and this review showed the strength and weakness of Z5C very fairly. Ah, acronym was out of context, and the tense used later seemed to confirm that you'd meant AP. I have a Z5 compact and I really miss my Nexus 5 (yes Nexus 5 2013) camera.. Z5 Compact could be faster focusing, capturing, etc. But the Nexus 5 HDR+ is much better at mid-low light, and the photos look better at real size.. The Z5 camera is awesome at a perfect sunlight scenario, but terrible without a good light.. And of course, the Z5 video camera is also incredible.. I went from Nexus 5 to Sony Z5 Compact and found the Sony camera to preform noticeably better in all lighting conditions.. All in all, I think this is a downgrade from the Z3C I own. with even more plastic, questionable button placement, and a much warmer. There are a few things I feel need addressing in this review so here I go:. This one is right up there with. Basically what happens, since Sony has their. theme engine and all, unless an app specifically calls for a colored. status bar, you'll get whatever color the theme dictates. The fact that nearly all themes are. just cheap marketing material drove me nuts, to the point where I used. the very unstable CM12.1 on my Z3C, until I realized I needed the. Sony has a theme creator on their site so I went. It really improves the situation imo, but the. greyish-blue of AOSP still pops up in the status bar.. >This is a $500 phone that doesn't quite have the specs to match other. because you want a small phone.. I don't see how this correlates -- 2GB of RAM is plenty (and you can't multitask on this small a screen), and the pixels are not visible unless your eye is one inch away from the display (which you shouldn't practice if you value your eyesight), so 720p is perfectly adequate. Considering other flagships cost as much if not more, I don't see an issue ... though that's not to say I wouldn't like the thing to be cheaper.. >Lastly, the Z5C does support some settings in the camera2 API, so you. can use a third-party app to get some good shots if you like.. Could you please tell us which those are (there is an app on the Store that checks, if you could please just run that and take a screenshot)? Sony's cameras have so far been notorious for using closed source software, and the Z3 series doesn't support a single camera2 API setting. Is the DRM still as strict as it used to be, if you have any information about that?. The AOSP team at Sony is working on improving that (as a matter of fact, RAW capture is working already, thanks Alin!), but stock is just unbearable as far as camera features go.. Supposedly the Z5/c will shut down the GPU when the screen is static to save battery life too. Probably a minor boost in screen on time if you spend a lot of time reading articles.. Not doable, unless you just swipe from homescreen to homescreen with network deactivated and no apps running.. I agree with you with the negative specs (specially the low light performance of the camera, and the 2GB of RAM for 64 bit Android).. But the 720p resolution is not a disadvantage at all, it's more like a pro. Thanks to this resolution you can play a lot of games without (almost) affect the SoT. Also, you need less bandwidth for youtube and all content is downloaded in ". xhdpi (extra-high) ~320dpi" which is fascinating for the battery life and data usage. So a 1080p display in this phone would add more damage than quality.. It's a 4.6" phone, 720p is the right choice. I went from Nexus 4 to Nexus 5 to Sony Z5 Compact too!. Review it's ok, but it missed totally the themes section from the ui part, and power management paragraph is quite messed up, xperia has stamina and queue background data options since kk and them both are way more efficient than doze.. As a former owner of a 2013 Moto X, I miss this form factor. It's a shame it's not getting an official North American release.. "The rear panel is a smooth piece of aluminum". Are you sure about that? Every other review says it's just frosted glass.. There is no aluminium used in the Z5 Compact, unlike it's bigger brothers. The low volume buttons aid with zooming when using the camera. Sony's has received many awards and plaudits for their Omnibalance industrial design.. Lower resolution phones use less RAM than higher resolution phones because unlike PCs, smartphone GPUs use the system RAM rather than having their own RAM. As resolution display increases, the OS and the apps need to load higher resolution images which uses more ram. 2GB is perfectly fine for 720p.. Exactly, I don't understand why more people don't recognise the position of the rocker is for zoom not for volume. You can argue whether it's beneficial, but there should be no questioning of why they put it so low.. Mind you, people like this generally don't rotate their phones to horizontal when shooting.. Price aside, would you consider this phone a proper successor to replace my aging Nexus 4? From what I'm seeing on the spec sheet, there's no compelling reason to upgrade. A mobile phone camera isn't a big priority for me, and this is still (currently) limited to Lollipop, just like my Nexus 4.. I have the hands of an 8 year old girl, so < 5" is important to me. 5"+ is just unmanageable for my child-like hands.. Sony is beta testing the Marshmallow update with Z5c and Z3c owners. The compelling things are: fingerprint sensor, 1080p 60fps video, multiple times faster processor, memory speed, and graphics, multi-day battery life, zero shutter delay, Sony's commitment to support devices longer than Google, waterproofing, front firing speakers, brighter display, quick charge 2.0 (it's significantly faster).. Indeed, install Google launcher and Google keyboard, and you instantly have a better than a Nexus , Nexus... More so when android 6.0 hits in the next month or so (z5, z3). "Sony's commitment to support devices longer than Google". Wait 2 years and see how much of that commitment Sony still has. Sony's "commitment" does a fat load of good for my Z1 Compact that'll be stuck on Android 5.1 (it's a SD800 device, if Nexus 5 can run Lollipop, so can all Z1 devices).. The only thing that keeps me from buying a compact is the design, it just doesn't click for me. Still hoping for HTC to make something competing it.(Mini 3 maybe?). Just leave vzw like a lot of us have.. Not a better option in my area. Also have all my family and inlaws on the plan. Would have to deal with fees and new phones... I wish they had better 4G service in Southern Texas outside the city.. I'm switching to AT&T myself for this phone. The rear panel is frosted glass.. where the heck do you buy this thing?. If you're in the US, eBay or online retailers that ship internationally. International sellers will often warranty the device but you have to ship it overseas. eBay sellers will expressly deny any warranty whatsoever.. Currently, you have to import it from the UK or elsewhere most likely. Look up on Amazon, you should find a few around the $530 range, which isn't too bad of a markup for this phone. I'm enjoying mine on T-Mo, my only problem: no band 12. (device has it, but you know.. Well, no VoLTE on band 12. You should get LTE on band 12 though since T-Mobile hasn't shut it off iirc.. The main problem is that right now, I get terrible reception where I work. That suggests to me that my phone is running on Band 4,which is the 1900/2100 MHz band. Drives me bonkers when I can't do a simple task.. T-Mobile does ask the OEMs to shut down the band for which they don't have certification for.. From what I understand, T-Mobile is only asking OEMs to shut it down on devices sold in the US. Unless T-Mobile has somehow taken that spectrum worldwide, Sony has no reason to comply. You can try this to find out: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.simplyadvanced.ltediscovery&hl=en. Maybe band 12 isn't used in the location you purchased it from and therefore is disabled?. Without root, and I don't feel like rooting the Z5c right now without losing the proprietary drivers for the camera... I can't fully utilize that app. However, I already knew I was on Band 4 which is what the app is telling me, and T-Mobile does have Band 12 available in the DFW metroplex. We've got a link in the specs at the top to Expansys. They have the international version in stock.. I've said it before and I'll say it again. Sony has the expertise to kick ass in the US market, but they seem to refuse to make it happen.. I currently have a 2013 Moto X. I REALLY love its size, and any new phones seem too big. Everyone I talk to who has had the 2013 Moto X feels the same way. My wife had one and recently got the Nexus 5X, and it's just too dang big.. I wish Sony would bring this to the US and market the crap out of that compactness. I came from a Moto X 2013, got the Sony Z5 Compact and actually thought it was too small. The Oneplus X with its 5", is a really nice size. Now how well does it work on TMobile here in the US? Since it's not actually sold here sadly :-( This is by far the best, and really only small phone out there, and the only thing I wanna upgrade from my Z3 Compact to. I'm not in the market for a 5.5+ incher, but I could maybe stretch to 5.2 inch if the bezels were small. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the Z5C vs the Z5, does the Z5 feel *that much* bigger? Does it perform *that much* better?. I love my Z5 Compact, writing this comment from my Z5C. Going home today to pick up this phone. Hopefully it gets good dev support. Roughly 8 hours of screen-on time is doable". I believe the volume rocker is placed below the power button for a reason - to be used as the zoom buttons when taking photos in the landscape orientation.. I heard Android Marshmallow upgrade will improve the amazing battery even better. I'm waiting for it to roll into mine. "The device is small enough that I can get my fingers around the edges and reach almost the entire screen with my thumb.". It's crazy that it is so hard to find a phone where you can do this. I can just barely do it with my N5, but it's a struggle at times.. This is the phone of 2015 which is not gonna disappoint you.. I have the first generation of Sony's Z Compact phones, the Z1 Compact. I'm really not happy with this device. For several users ( http://forum.xda-developers.com/sony-xperia-z1-compact/help/battery-reporting-phone-dying-suddenly-t3095120 ), the battery has completely died in just over a year. You can replace it, but the back cover is glued on which makes it so much harder than it should have been, and I ended up messing up the aesthetics of the device (I'm clumsy). This is the first time I ever had a bad battery, will never buy a device with a glued on back cover again after this and Sony is just dead to me after this, if there are so many batteries dying, they should have done a large scale recall. Secondly there's the matter of support, the Z1 Compact will not get Marshmallow, there's just been the 5.1 update (so late!), so you get less than 2 years in support and you're always a year behind the Android release schedule. I know Sony says they're going to do better with the Z5 series but I don't care anymore. They said so as well about the Z series when I still had my Xperia S and it turns out nothing has changed. So all in all, can't recommend the Z5 Compact even if the device itself has its merits.. Should be compared to iPhone 6: 4,7" screen, 720 res.... It will be even better with marshmallow.. "The power button and volume rocker are too low on the body of the phone to be used comfortably.". I wonder how the tester is holding his phone... I have the Z3 Compact (power button is in the same spot), and it is in a very comfortable position. For me, it is better placed than on most other phones where the power button is higher up, like the Nexus 5 which I have used.. So I'd definitely not count this as a "negative", but as a matter of personal preference.. Something I always miss in a review like this is "Overall Experience". Reviews always tend to focus on the seperate parts (like it should), but forget about the overall feeling of using this device.. I (living in Denmark) bought one of these on the day it came out. really beautiful pictures, loved the fingerprint scanner, and was actually ok with the design. The device is soooo slow when navigating around Android and launching apps. It lags constantly, gets way too hot when the camera is activated, which makes the phone burn through the battery, and is generally not very fun to use. Are you a rapid snapchat user, the camera will be active much of the time, and even though it is just running in the background, that app will leave you with 3-4 hours of SOT.. While the camera takes beautiful pictures, the camera app itself is super slow at launching. 2-3 seconds mostly if its not running already. And when you try to take a picture, it uses 2-3 seconds saving the picture. That is not very optimal for a phone camera, where the primary use often is capturing a unique situation quickly. Last but not least, I didn't thought that the 720p screen would be a problem, but I constantly notice pixels when using it, and the oleophobic coating makes the screen a mess. I once had a Moto X (2013) with a 720p screen, but the AMOLED screen just made it miles better than this LCD 720p.. The device looks great on paper, and performs great in tests, but the overall daily experience using it, is very bad. Too many problems with this device, but the worst is the slow storage they used. That just messes up the experience.. Note: Our Xperia Z5 review will be up in a day or two.. Have to disagree with the 'cons' listed in this post. For me, the only 'con' (worry?) I'd list is that the plug (when plugged into a power outlet for recharging) becomes (what seems to me) to be dangerously hot - I've found myself having to point a fan on it to help alleviate that. For that reason, I never leave it unattended while the phone's recharging.. In every other respect, though, I love Sony Xperia Z5 Compact and can't see myself buying any other brand in the future, provided Sony keeps up the great work..

Sony Xperia Z5 Compact - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 … 58 59 ». gabeA., 29 Jan 2018 after 2 years of having the phone, i noticed even at 50%+ battery life it DIES. more The battery is worn out and can't supply enough current. help, My sony Z5 compact white, touch screen misbehaving, am using 7.1.1, what can i do. Very good mobile device,, and strong Body.. Thanks to Sony Xperia Z5 Compact.. Still Great Device!!! 7.1.1!!! Benchmark (89K)!!! Usable Without Mobile Data!!!. Help needed in making fingerprint more effective, when I use fingerprint it say to unlock using pattern despite making so many efforts it does not fully unlock with fingerprint. At one of Sony forums I got a tip of pasting tape n using but that does not work either any solution please.. I'm using this phone for the last year and a half. The camera was wonderful the first couple of months, but it's like it's taking worse and worse photos as the time passes. It started having some issues with freezing for the last 6months as well. But I still think it's a great phone & I love its design. Great phone when I first got it, but the more you use it, and apps running, the phone gets wildly hot and kills the battery. So the claimed battery life takes a knock. overall its a great phone, using it now 2+ years and no real issue.. after 2 years of having the phone, i noticed even at 50%+ battery life it DIES. yes it dies and tells you with the icon drained battery but plugging it again shows the remaining battery .WTF? noticed it started flickering after the last update. the screen flickers whatnot and gets hot EVERYTIME! Sony has no say to this. The warranty's void and we seem to be in the dark. Sony telling us to buy another.. Using this fone fr last 3 days, feeling much relaxed that I managed getting this fone. I have used many cellfones but found this one as the best very good sound quality compact good cam in daylight I recommend this fone to anyone interested in a compact one. I did use z1 compact z3 compact x compact and now z5 compact, best is z5 x compact also not bad but the worst is z3 compact.. is there any security patch is coming for this device in 2017. I have this phone for 1 1/2 year and works just fine, no lag, battery keeps me for two days. The only downside, in my opinion, is the low quality of night photos. The screen also seem rather small these days, I plan to update to a 5-5.2 inch compact from Sony - hope they'll make one this year.. Z5 Compact (2015), 21 Dec 2017 Good Device But Bad Software Update In 7.1.1! Bugs Bugs Bugs Bugs!!!! Sony Please Fix This 7.1... A simple task like opening Spotify can take up to two min..

Hayato Huseman October 21, 2015 1:30 am. Sony is behind some of the best imaging sensors around, powering some of the top smartphone shooters on the market, from the Galaxy S6 to the LG G4. When we looked at the Xperia Z3 , it had one of the better cameras we’d seen at the time … but since then, other phones (like the aforementioned from Samsung and LG) have seriously stepped up their game, finally even surpassing Apple’s long-time imaging lead with the iPhone. The Xperia Z5 has been tested and rated by some as one of the best camera phones around, but can its smaller sibling hold up the family name?. Our Xperia Z5 Compact review unit was sent to us courtesy of our friends at Clove Technology, from whom you can order your own Z5 Compact or any of hundreds of other devices. Pay them a visit at clove.co.uk !. The specs on the Xperia Z5 Compact’s camera are quite impressive. It’s a 23 MP Sony IMX 230 sensor with a max output of. 5520 х 4140, and 4K video capabilities. I took the Z5 Compact out to the campus of Indiana University in Bloomington, IN, and spent the day shooting as many photos as I could.. The physical camera button was extremely refreshing to use, and aided heavily in my shooting throughout the day.. It’s pretty apparent in the above photos that the Z5 Compact heavily favors warmer tones when you’re shooting outdoors. More often than not, the photos you take end up with a pretty serious yellow hue cast over everything, almost as if you were passing them through an Instagram filter. Other times, images look a bit washed out and undersaturated — some of that can be explained away by remembering that. most smartphones these days tend to oversaturate photos, and the duller-looking images are actually more true-to-life … except when they’re not.. It’s especially noticeable in the sample photo with a tree in the front; the whole shot is blown out, colors are washy, and nothing seems particularly in focus. You could just call it a poorly taken photo — after all, I’m no professional photographer — but sadly, shots like this are more common than I had hoped for.. Then again, some of the photos in the above collection have terrific colors and tack-sharp detail (I’m quite partial to the “Kanye Time” shot I took on the way to a late breakfast with a friend). The Z5 Compact seems to be capable of some really terrific shots at times, but the wild inconsistency in quality can definitely be frustrating.. While the iPhone’s shot is overly cool-toned, there’s more detail and less blowout than in the Sony sample — a recurring theme for the Z5 Compact.. If you manage to look past the warm tones of the camera (or if you don’t mind correcting them in post, since you can shoot in. RAW), you can take some terrific-looking photos with the Z5 Compact, but one thing that I. just couldn’t look past was the utterly relentless lens flare when shooting outdoors. Most of the above samples look pretty good, but I had to sort out nearly half of the shots I had taken before I uploaded, because every other photo was completely distracted by flaring.. In some photos it’s worse than others, but more often than not the entire image ends up unusable, unless you’re really going for that JJ Abrams-style dramatic lens flare effect. After voicing my concerns on Twitter, a few people have suggested I check the lens for smudging, but sure enough, the glass is pristine — in fact, in the two photos below, all it took was hovering my hand slightly beside the lens in the way of the sun to turn a shot from a disaster into a pretty good photo.. Indoor photos are actually pretty good. There’s a sufficient amount of detail proportionate to the surrounding lighting situation, and while images are predictably a bit blurrier than if taken in direct sunlight, the built-in OIS helps keep things together. Colors get a bit washed out, but no more than with indoor photos from any other phone we’ve seen. Selfies taken with the 5.1 MP front-facing camera look adequate, but nothing particularly special.. Something that impressed me the most with the Z5 Compact’s camera software was the outstanding stitching when taking a panoramic photo. It’s sort of annoying that the software doesn’t let you stop halfway through if you run out of room; once you’ve started a panorama, you’ve gotta stay its course. But once you do, the result is worth it — the stitching is so impressive that the entire collage looks like a single, seamless ultra-wide shot.. What do you make of these samples? Is the Z5 Compact’s camera all it’s talked up to be, or are you disappointed by some of its. shortcomings? Let’s have a friendly discussion in the comments below! And remember: the camera may be one of the Xperia Z5 Compact’s headline features, but it’s not nearly the whole story — to catch that, tune in to our full review, coming later this week!.

Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Overheating Issues Could Lead To Unresponsive Touch Screen. 6 October 2015, 9:00 am EDT By Alexandra Burlacu Tech Times. The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact is apparently facing some overheating issues, and the Snapdragon 810 chipset is again considered the culprit.. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 64-bit processor is no doubt powerful, but overheating issues have been plaguing nearly every device it powered. By now it's no longer a secret that smartphones packing the Snapdragon 810 tend to overheat, but some OEMs have found various ways to prevent this from becoming an issue.. Others, meanwhile, have chosen to avoid the Snapdragon 810 altogether. Samsung, for instance, preferred to equip its flagships with Exynos chipsets, while some other OEMs opted for the Snapdragon 808 instead of the overheating 810.. Nevertheless, there are still plenty of OEMs that still relied on the Snapdragon 810 for their handsets, and most of them are now facing criticism and complaints of overheating issues.. Sony, meanwhile, equipped its top-notch Xperia 5 Premium with extra heat pipes and thermal paste on the processor so it wouldn't face overheating issues due to the Snapdragon 810, indicating that it was well aware of the situation. The extra heat pipes allow for the heat to dissipate more quickly and effectively so the device wouldn't overheat.. It remained unclear initially whether the smaller Xperia Z5 Compact had the same treatment to avoid the Snapdragon 810's issues, but it now seems that question has been answered.. The Xperia Z5 Compact is apparently overheating just like other smartphones that pack the Snapdragon 810 without other precautions to prevent it from running too hot. Owners of the latest compact flagship from Sony have started to complain that their phones are getting excessively hot, and this overheating could lead to other issues.. New reports out of China claim that the Xperia Z5 Compact gets so hot at times that the screen actually becomes either sluggish or completely unresponsive, unable to register touch input. A video of such an instance surfaced. on MyDrivers, showing obvious issues with touch input on the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact. It remains unclear at this point, however, whether these touch issues are indeed related to overheating, as subsequent reports argue they may stem from other causes.. On the other hand, some Xperia Z5 Compact owners have reportedly been able to overcome the touch issues at least temporarily by throttling the chipset to lower the temperatures, albeit apparently this method didn't work for everyone.. It also remains unclear for now whether these overheating and touch issues affect only a small number of Xperia Z5 Compact units or whether the problems are more widespread. It's also worth pointing out the Xperia Z5 Compact has yet to reach more markets, including the U.S., which makes it even more difficult to determine how widespread the issues are..

Sony Xperia Z5 Compact: Long-term 2016 re-review. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact 2016 re-review: Design. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact 2016 re-review: Performance and battery life. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact 2016 re-review: Screen and media. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact 2016 re-review: Cameras. Our long-term re-review of the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact examines how this mini mobile stands up against rivals in 2016. Is it still worth buying, now that Sony’s latest dinky smartphone, the Xperia X Compact , has just hit stores?. The Xperia Z5 Compact from Japanese giant Sony was the only phone under 5-inches that won a perfect score from us back in 2015. colourful frame is pleasingly easy to operate with just one hand, but the miniaturised design doesn’t mean compromising with. Rather, the Xperia Z5 Compact boasts the same solid 23-megapixel snapper and nippy Snapdragon processor. as its bigger brother, the Xperia Z5 .. You also get most of the full-sized Z5’s premium features packed into that shrunken body, including. Remote Play game streaming, Hi-Res Audio support and plenty more besides. All things considered, it’s no surprise the Z5 Compact is one of our top picks in our best mini mobiles round-up .. So we really, absolutely loved the Xperia Z5 Compact when we reviewed it a year ago, but does it still hold a special place in our heart after all this time? We’ve been using the phone as our full-time handset again for this 2016 re-review, and here’s what we think.. Read next: Xperia Z5 Compact vs Xperia X. Compact, which is best for me?. So far in 2016, the trend has definitely been towards massive mobiles. We’re not just talking premium devices like the Galaxy Note 7 and Galaxy S7 Edge , either. Even affordable phones like the Moto G4 and the great-value OnePlus 3 come packing mighty 5.5-inch screens , as more and more consumers make use of their data bundles by streaming a bit of Netflix on the go.. That’s why returning to the Xperia Z5 Compact is. kind of like pulling on some fluffy slippers after rocking your stiff. Sure, the Z5 Compact lacks the glitzy finish of its glass-and-metal brothers, but it’s bloody comfortable to use. That chunky frame sits perfectly in the hand, and we’ve had no trouble at all using the phone with just one mitt whenever necessary (mostly. while hurtling along on a London bus, clinging desperately to a sweaty pole).. After a fair bit of jostling, knocking about and other punishment, the Xperia Z5 Compact is still in top condition. That bright yellow plastic body hasn’t picked up any proper scuffs, scratches or devastating cracks, unlike its bigger brother the Xperia Z5 – check out our long-term Z5 review if you want to know more about that particular debacle.. And the Xperia Z5 Compact is fully water resistant too, so you can accidentally dunk it into your pint with no ill effects. That’s something we haven’t seen on any other mini handsets except for the i Phone 7 –. not even Sony’s new Xperia X Compact is immune to a dipping.. The Xperia Z5 Compact rocks the same Snapdragon 810 processor as its bigger brother. and a full year of toil hasn’t had any negative effects. The Z5 Compact was a smooth little sailor when we first reviewed it, with none of the occasional little stutters that we saw on some other Snapdragon 810 handsets. abusing it on a regular basis, this dinky. phone still has plenty of bite.. In fact, we’ve only seen a single crash in the past twelve months, which was swiftly resolved by restarting the phone. That aside, this handset has been perfectly well behaved.. This year’s Xperia X Compact uses the energy-efficient Snapdragon 650 processor, so the Z5 Compact is almost equal to the latest mini Sony when it comes to performance. In benchmarking tests, the X Compact still wins out, scoring 78224 in AnTuTu compared with a score of 56216 from the Z5 Compact. But in terms of everyday user experience, they’re both pleasingly capable.. Battery life was another highlight of the Z5 Compact and this also hasn’t diminished over time. With everyday use (emails, web browsing, the odd snap and some media streaming) you should comfortably get up to a day and a half of use. Sony’s Stamina and Low Battery modes to stretch out the mini mobile’s life, when needed.. Read next: The best Sony Xperia phones you can buy right now. Any phone packing a Snapdragon 810 processor usually entices the same question from our readers: “Does it get hot when you’re using it?” Well, the Xperia Z5 Compact does occasionally heat up, but only if you’re hammering it by. shooting lengthy 4K video or with lengthy gaming sessions. Good news is, the phone very rarely reaches a troublesome temperature. In fact, you can shoot almost half an hour of 4K footage before the camera app finally gives up on life.. Cinema fans might scoff at the idea of watching an entire movie on a dinky little 4.6-inch screen, but when we’re kicking back with a bit of Netflix on the Z5 Compact, we. never find ourselves squinting or coming out the other end with a migraine. helped in some large part by the crisp 720p HD resolution. Visuals are sharp and bright enough to see even in sunny conditions, while the option to boost the panel’s vibrancy with Sony’s Super Vivid mode is appreciated.. Read next: Sony Xperia Z5 Compact tips and tricks. 32GB of built-in storage space is respectable and enough for plenty of apps and media, although it’ll fill up fast once you start shooting home movies.. At that point, you can thankfully just hunt out a microSD memory card to transfer your data.. Sony has admirably crammed the same 23-megapixel camera found in the full-sized Xperia Z5 into the Compact model, and we’re still fans after a year of use. It may not be a perfect snapper, while some of the features such as the post processing that occurs on digitally zoomed images could be easily dismissed as a bit gimmicky. But you’ll struggle to find a more dependable snapper on another mini smartphone, offering a similar user experience and results to. the Xperia X Compact and Apple’s iPhone SE .. Read next: Xperia Z5 23-megapixel camera supertest. Of course, Sony has overhauled its camera interface since our full Xperia Z5 Compact review, rolling it out to existing handsets as a standard update. So, is that new camera app an improvement?. Well, the biggest change is in how you select which camera mode to use. Superior Auto is of course the default, which intelligently picks the correct scene settings for the current conditions. If you wish to swap to manual mode, you can now flick up the screen – the transition takes roughly a second, so you’re not hanging around too long and less time is wasted than before, where you had to tap into the modes menu and then tap the manual button.. Alternatively, if you wish to shoot video, you now have to flick down the screen to enter movie mode. With the old app, it was simply a case of hitting the on-screen video button, which sat alongside the shutter button, so the process now takes a little longer. So far it hasn’t been an issue, thankfully, and this is the same setup as you’ll find on the iPhone. If nothing else, it keeps the interface neat and tidy.. Of course you still get the usual crazy Sony camera modes tucked away, just a quick flick. You can once again add live cartoon effects to your shots, dual shoot with both cameras at once and so on. If you want to record 4K video, you’ll also have to jump in here and select the special mode – you can’t do that from the standard movie mode.. But at least you get the option to shoot UHD 4K footage, something skipped on the Xperia X Compact.. This year’s Xperia X Compact may add a fresh new camera experience and boost benchmarking performance, but the year-old Xperia Z5 Compact has its own advantages, including water resistance and 4K video recording.. After twelve months, we’re still happy to return to the Z5 Compact at any time. The compact dimensions, smooth everyday user experience, solid battery life and dependable camera make it a great all-round mini mobile. And with a new £300 to £350 price tag, it’s well worth a look for anyone who’s sick of massive handsets.. Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact vs X Compact: A serious upgrade, in every respect.

If you hate big phones and don't mind last year's hardware, this one's for you. Page: 1 2 Next →. - Feb 20, 2016 2:30 pm UTC. Specs at a glance: Sony Xperia Z5 Compact. (Four 2.0 GHz Cortex-A57 cores and four 1.6. 32GB with up to 200GB external storage supported via microSD. UMTS HSPA+ 850 (Band V), 900 (Band VIII), 1900 (Band II),.

RGB notification LED, NFC, Quick Charge 2.0. The Z5 Compact and the iPhone 5S—Sony's phone is bigger, but it's newer, and it's still smaller than most Android flagships.. From left to right: iPhone 4S, iPhone 5S, Z5 Compact, Nexus 5, Nexus 5X.. Bottom to top: Nexus 5X, Nexus 5, Z5 Compact, iPhone 5S.. The compartment that hides the nano SIM and microSD slots.. The button arrangement (from left to right, power, volume, and camera) is a little weird.. iPhone 5S, Z5 Compact, Nexus 5, Nexus 5X.. The frosted glass back of the Z5 Compact.. The headphone jack and a microphone pinhole.. One oft-cited benefit of the Android ecosystem is its diversity. If you don’t like something that Samsung did to its flagship this year, you can go to another company whose phone you like better without leaving all your Google Play purchases behind.. But a confluence of factors—a slowed rate of hardware improvement, limits on what you can physically fit into a smartphone, general lack of imagination and risk-averseness from OEMs who are making razor-thin profits if. they’re making profits at all—means that most flagship phones are frustratingly homogenous. Take a 5-point-something-inch screen and whatever Qualcomm’s latest chip is and squeeze it into a rectangle with the best battery and camera that will fit, and you’ve got yourself a flagship smartphone.. This is perhaps the worst deal for people who want a smaller smartphone that isn’t an older or slower smartphone. This brings us to Sony’s Xperia Z5 Compact, which is finally coming to the US after a few months of availability overseas. means it’s not the freshest phone around, it’s still pretty much your only option if you want a phone that is simultaneously fast, small, and modern (at least until that “ iPhone 5SE ” comes out).. Ultimately I came away less thrilled with the way the Z5 Compact looked and felt than I wanted to—it feels like a throwback in both good and bad ways. Ultimately this is probably what its target audience wants, but it didn’t do much for me.. The Z5 Compact is square and brick-shaped, and both the front and back are totally flat glass (the front is normal glossy screen glass and the back is a frosted glass with aluminum detailing, according to Sony). We’re generally pretty negative about glass-backed smartphones around these parts because they double the amount of glass that you can shatter if you drop your phone. The only mitigating factors in the Z5 Compact’s favor are that (1) you are probably less likely to drop a smaller phone and (2) the plastic sides of the phone are pretty thick and may serve as a decent shock-absorbent bumper for the rest of the phone.. The phone is also a bit thicker than some of the larger or older phones I compared it to—the larger Nexus 5 and 5X are both thinner than the Z5 Compact despite being a bit wider, and the old iPhone 5 and 5S design is simultaneously narrower and thinner. has thicker bezels around the display than many Android phones have had lately. As phones have expanded in size, OEMs have tried to shrink the bezels to the sides of the display to keep the width of their phones halfway reasonable. Sony hasn’t used any of these tricks on the Z5 Compact, so what you end up with is narrower than many 5-inch phones but not as narrow as it feels like it should be.. As thick and brick-like as the Z5 Compact is, it still scratches that small-phone itch in a lot of ways. It’s narrower and taller than contemporary flagships, making it much easier to fit in a pocket and better suited for one-handed use.. Most crucially, it's shorter than any recent flagship, making it easier to reach anything on the screen with your thumb if you’re holding the phone in one hand. Whether you can reach anywhere on the screen will depend on the size of your hands; I can do it, but you might still have trouble reaching if your hands are smaller.. It doesn’t quite reverse the trend toward larger and larger phones we’ve witnessed in the last half-decade (if you’re looking for something iPhone 4S- or iPhone 5-sized, you’ll be disappointed), but the Xperia Compact series. at least fights back .. Like most of Sony's phones, the Z5 Compact is also dust and waterproof as long as the port cover on the phone's left side is closed. It can be left in up to 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes and can be used in chlorinated swimming pools as long as you rinse it with fresh water afterwards.. The screen itself is a 720p panel, a resolution that was replaced by 1080p in flagship phones at right around the time 5-inch screens became the norm. At 4.6 inches, 720p works out to a pixel density of 319 PPI, which is more than adequate. The display panel is bright and colors look good, but there is a higher-than-usual amount of brightness shift if you’re looking at it from an angle (which is to say, it’s noticeably dimmer when viewed from above, below, or either side than it is when viewed head-on). The screen’s digitizer is faintly visible, too, which can cause a slight. shimmering effect if you’re looking at the phone in bright or outdoor light.. Fans of expandable storage will appreciate the microSD slot hidden underneath a panel next to the nano SIM slot—it can accept cards “up to 200GB” in size, which accounts for expensive high-capacity cards like this one from SanDisk. And there’s a dedicated camera button on the bottom-right edge of the phone, a nifty addition you don’t see much outside of the remains of the Windows Phone ecosystem.. There’s a large power button in the center of the phone, which is a place where my thumb rests sometimes depending on how I’m grabbing the phone. It’s not so sensitive that you’ll automatically press it when your finger is on it, but it’s a risk. And the volume located between the power and camera buttons is small enough that you can easily press the whole thing down at once, which is awkward if you’re reaching blindly into your pocket to turn things up or down.. Sony's tweaked version of the Quick Settings shade is easier to customize.. Sony adds a couple of extra battery saver modes to the Z5.. The "Ultra Stamina" mode is pretty restrictive but should save a lot of power.. Customizing the low power mode settings.. Lollipop's stock battery saver mode is still hidden away if you prefer it for some reason.. The multitasking switcher is familiar but adds a dock with app icons across the bottom of the screen.. Those are called "small apps," and they let you create windows that float over the top of the rest of the OS.. You can download new small apps or make new ones out of any standard Android widget.. Making a new "small app" out of a widget.. Now it floats over the top of the active app. It can be moved and closed at any time.. The camera app includes a wealth of shooting modes.. The Z5 Compact ships with Android 5.1.1, which is unfortunate given that Marshmallow was released four months ago. When we review a 6-inch phone that ships with Lollipop, we can point people who want updates to the Nexus line. If you want a 4.6-inch phone that isn’t a bargain-basement dumpster fire, the Z5 Compact is your only game in town. Sony has promised an Android 6.0 update for it , and the company actually updates its phones for quite a while after they’re released, we just don’t know when to expect it.. Sony’s version of Android is relatively lightly skinned—Sony changes a bunch of icons and adds a few things to the multitasking switcher and Quick Settings shade, but most of it will be recognizable to users of the Nexus version of Android.. Some of Sony’s changes are actually pretty nice. Editing the Quick Settings shade in stock Marshmallow involves turning on the System UI Tuner , which is off by default and buried in the Settings even when enabled. It lets you rearrange, add, and remove icons from the Quick Settings and even enable a battery percentage indicator, but it’s not very convenient.. Sony adds a button at the top of the shade that takes you right into a Quick Settings editing mode, one that offers access to a few more settings than Google's does (including screen casting, NFC, data syncing, and others). A battery life percentage indicator is included and enabled by default, which is nice if you’re the kind of person who gets itchy when you can’t see that number (hello).. Sony one-ups Google’s Battery Saver mode with some extra options as well. You’re able to configure exactly what services and apps are enabled and disabled when you need to save battery. Lollipop’s default Battery Saver mode is present if you want it, but it’s buried under “Power Management > Battery Usage” in the Settings.. Further Reading A look at Android 5.1: speed, security, tweaks. Of more dubious benefit is the “small apps” feature, accessible on the same screen as the multitasking switcher. This customizable, four-icon dock lets you launch little windowed apps that float over the top of your main app. A handful of Sony and Google apps support the feature out of the box, and Sony provides links to a section of the Google Play Store populated by small apps. As an added bonus, any standard Android widget can be turned into a small app if you want.. that work best are the ones that need to be brought up and dismissed quickly, like the timer or the calculator. For others, it seems like it would be easier to switch to the full app or use the normal widget version instead. I found the Z5 Compact’s screen too small for small apps to really be useful, though I can definitely see how it would be useful on a phablet or tablet.. Many of Sony’s other apps fall into one of two categories, either “mildly entertaining distraction” or “duplicative of Google’s generally superior version of the same app.” The company does at least appear to be updating most of these apps through the Google Play Store rather than system software updates—Android OEMs seem. to have gotten the memo about this even if they can’t get new Android updates out in a timely manner. Sony also bundles a few PlayStation apps with the phone, but they’re available for other Android phones through the Google Play Store so it’s not a big selling point for Sony diehards.. The best of Sony’s apps is probably the camera, which isn’t surprising given the company’s experience with cameras and smartphone camera sensors. It gives you several different shooting modes, links to more downloadable shooting modes, and offers full manual control over ISO, exposure, white balance, and a few other things. It won’t shoot in RAW mode, but otherwise it’s a solid app.. For Android enthusiasts, another point in Sony’s favor is that the company is pretty good about posting things for the open source community to work with , including bootloader unlocking guides and how-to posts. for building and flashing “stock” AOSP Android to your phone. This also makes it easier for third-party ROM projects like CyanogenMod to get builds up and running on Xperia phones. You do all of this at your own risk, and it shouldn’t be considered a selling point for most “normal” people, but for the technically inclined it’s something to consider.. in Classics from Kenyon College and has over five years of experience in IT.
