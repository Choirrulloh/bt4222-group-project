Asus Zenfone V V520KL - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 ». Rexx, 10 Dec 2017 Is this released here in philippines?? This is a Verizon Wireless only phone, so since there is no VZW in the Philippines, you probably won't be able to buy this phone.. the only thing i dont trust asus since i first use it is durability,. after the 2nd phone i hesitate to buy this brand anymore.. Is this released here in philippines??. Addressing the comments comparing this to the leeco phone, this for one has a headphone jack, and mediatek processors have garbage per core and multicore performance compared to any Qualcomm chip, and the amoled on this phone is unparalleled by any leeco phone. how can this be a gsm phone when it is a verizon exclusive only phone??. asus just use the name to make high price on the market. but the specs is suck compare LeEco Le S3. price reasonable, 4gbram and deca core. Good or bad one, I am not buying phones without radio!!!!!!. Ive got an asus zenfone 2 and my experience with it is really bad im seeing alot of complaining about problems about their screens like ghost touch and permanently unable to touch some of the screen's part and i got that problem too. It occured after 8-10 months of usage no major accident or problem happened in the phone just automatically broke itself and one problem too is their camera its so bad and it gets even worse after some time. The phone also heats up so fast even light usage. Battery is also bad even in new condition time. I will never buy asus phones again. One of the worst brand in the smartphone industry. Dont get baited in their specs. almost 17 members whom i know is facing this issue. if anyone is willing to buy a asus zenfone 2 (series type) then my humble request is pls don't buy that bcoz i,my frnds,and many members using asus zenfone 2 has touchscreen problem.Asus service center won't provide anything.they'll be hiding.half of my mobile screen wont work.it happens after 6 months of after buying that.but other all are okay.i never let my phone to fell down any day.but some inside device problem has encountered it.. ASUS must back to older interface. still now/or never there is no volte on zenfone 2 551ml (23k).. ASUS - in search for nothing. If anyone is considering a Asus phone, be warned, they can push out an OTA update that can kill your battery making it impossible to charge or turn on your phone, effectively bricking it.. Anonymous, 25 Sep 2017 Other sites are reporting the price is $384. This is actually a nice phone. more Asus cameras are only good on paper. Just head to the Zenfone forums to see how many people got problems with their cameras.. Same specs as mi5 of xiaomi.. Other sites are reporting the price is $384. This is actually a nice phone. Camera with OIS should be good.. i think this device will have high expensive. just look at to new low midrange devices of asus. allof them pricing more than 300$ for example zenfone 4 selfie. with 288$ u can buy HTC 10 & have all specs of ZENFONE V. even planning to get android OREO. Manyakis maraig, 18 Sep 2017 Is this a flagship phone or a midrange phone? And how much is it gonna cost?? Kind of 'lower flagship range' since SD835 created. The price would be little bit lower than regular ZF4 (ZE554KL) estimately since SD660 can performs almost like SD820. Maybe for the people who needs powerful phone at low cost i think.. stupid designe like samsung phones &#128545;&#128545;&#128545;&#128­545;. Anonymous, 18 Sep 2017 Is it release internationally??? hopefully it is, if not, this phone would have low sales since Asus is not that much used in United States, or people can do import and have it unlocked for their country.

Single Review, online available, Medium, Date: 12/08/2017 Rating: Total score : 80%. 72% Asus Zenfone V Review Source: Phone Arena Asus has created a phone that could only compete on Verizon's tiny roster. At Big Red, you can still get an iPhone 6s for $70 more or the Moto Z2 Play for $20 more, both of which will offer better battery life and are likely to take better photos. In totality, though, the differences between these three phones aren't huge. If you're a Verizon customer, you will be getting a lot of value for $380, as the Asus Zenfone V is a premium-looking device with fast internals, but just don't be surprised if your friends on other networks lord their superior OnePlus or Honor devices over you. Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 10/27/2017 Rating: Total score : 72%. Asus Zenfone V Review: A solid, affordable Verizon exclusive Source: Talk Android Would I recommend the Zenfone V for the budget conscious consumer? Absolutely, butâ¦ It doesnât live in a vacuum. For a few dollars more, Verizonâs Moto Z2 Play has a better AMOLED screen, more premium aluminum build and support for a growing number of Moto Mods. Best Buy is currently offering last yearâs Galaxy S7 edge for only $14.99/mo, which is a much more premium device for less than the Zenfone V. Unlocked Motorola phones like the Moto G5 Plus are more than $100 less outright (with lesser specs to match). Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 09/27/2017. This display is quite big for a smartphone but frequently used for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. In the notebook sector, Asus had a global market share of about 11% from 2014-2016, making it the fourth largest laptop manufacturer. In the smartphone sector, Asus is not among the Top 5 and has only a small market share (as of 2016).. Similar devices from a different Manufacturer. LeEco Le Pro3 Elite Adreno 530.

In totality, though, the differences between these three phones aren't huge. If you're a Verizon customer, you will be getting a lot of value for $380, as the Asus Zenfone V is a premium-looking device with fast internals, but just don't be surprised if your friends on other networks lord their superior OnePlus or Honor devices over you.
