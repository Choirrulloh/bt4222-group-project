Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

With a 5.7-inch display, there's a lot of room to scribble on this handset.. - Jun 1, 2016 2:21 pm UTC. LG is challenging Samsung's Note smartphones with a new stylus-equipped handset of its own. While the Stylus 2 was announced earlier this year, the Stylus 2 Plus builds on that phone's design and improves the guts for. The two biggest improvements are in the Stylus 2 Plus' screen and processor. display on the first model, the new model has the same size screen but with a 1920×1080 resolution. The processor has also been upgraded to a. 1.4GHz octa-core chip from the first phone's 1.2GHZ quad-core CPU.. The Stylus 2 Plus will also have 16GB of onboard storage, a 3,000 mAh battery, and a fingerprint sensor on the back of the handset. The cameras will change depending on where the device is sold: some markets will get a 16-megapixel rear camera and an 8MP front-facing camera. Others will have the same 13MP rear camera and 5MP front-facing camera in the original Stylus 2. RAM will change depending on region as well, with some countries receiving 3GB of RAM and others getting 2GB.. According to some reports , the. included pen has a "nano coating" of some sort that will make writing on the screen feel more like writing with a pen on paper. The stylus isn't rubber-tipped, and this coating should make its input more accurate than other pens. We'll have to test this out to see if it's true, of course, and we'll need to look at. how it compares to the writing experience on the Samsung Note.. provided pricing information for the Stylus 2 Plus, but it rolls out in Taiwan today and then in "other key markets in Asia, South America, Europe, and North America in the weeks to come.".

The LG Stylo 2 Plus is a relatively affordable MetroPCS phablet boasting useful stylus functionality, good battery life, and a set of features uncommon to midrange devices.. Great phone at a reasonable price. Unike the other reviews, I find the Stylus 2 Plus to be well made and packed with features and sold at a reasonable price. The included stylus is great for note taking. I got mine from T-mobile 5 months ago and have had no issues so far. The only "con" I see is the average quality Camera and average battery life. But the camera's output is pretty decent and battery life is useable. You could get a better phone but it will cost much more. Overall I'd say the Stylus 2 Plus offers a lot of bang for buck..

I'm having to keep shutting my phone off/on. I'm very disappointed in this phone because i do not have extra money to purchase another one.

LG Stylus 2 Review: LG’s cut-priced rival to Samsung’s Galaxy Note range is a mighty 5.7-inch mobile packing a built-in stylus pen, but is the LG Stylus 2 a worthy phablet for creative or business users? Here’s our full LG Stylus 2 UK review.. Samsung decided to drop a massive deuce on us Brits last year by not releasing the mighty Galaxy Note 5 on our fair shores. Instead, creative and professional UK users were stuck using the Galaxy Note 4 , which to be fair is still a bloody good phablet, packing Samsung’s excellent S Pen stylus.. If you’re after a styus-based mobile but your bank roll is limited, then one possible option is the LG Stylus 2. This £250 handset also packs a huge 5.7-inch screen and stylus tucked away around the back, but the specs aren’t quite as strong as Samsung’s Note handsets, in order to keep the cost down. Of course, to confuse matters a bit, LG just launched a model with boosted specs called the LG Stylus 2 Plus, but for now let’s take an in-depth look at the Stylus 2.. Read next: LG Stylus 2 vs LG Stylus 2 Plus vs Galaxy Note 5, which is best for me?. Like the Note series, the LG Stylus 2 is a big mother. At 5.7-inches, it’s certainly a test to try using the phone one-handed. Thankfully LG has at least added in a couple of extra features to make one-handed use less painful. For instance, you get a screen reduction feature, activated by swiping across the one-screen toolbar, and a special button on that same toolbar that pulls down your notifications bar (to save you stretching your thumb to the top of the screen).. Despite its bulk, the Stylus 2 is reasonably light and also quite slender, so I just about managed to fit it into my jeans pocket. SIlver edging gives way to a plastic back that sports a reasonably attractive brushed metal design, and the good news is you can prise that cover off to access a removable battery, plus the SIM card and memory card slots.. Around the back is where you’ll also find LG’s stylus, a slim and light pen that tucks away in its own little hole when not in use. More on this in the features section.. The 5.7-inch Stylus 2 display is a basic 720p IPS panel, which was a real surprise. After all, given the size of the phone and the asking price, we’d expect at least a Full HD screen. Still, high-def movies look decent and the display is perfectly fine for everyday use, if not quite a match for cheaper rivals like the Wileyfox Storm and OnePlus 2 .. On the back of the Stylus 2 you’ll spot a dinky speaker grille, which pumps out okay-sounding audio. It’s perfectly fine for watching a YouTube video on the go, but you’ll want to plug in some earphones if you want to enjoy your tunes or properly get stuck into a movie.. LG’s stylus is as basic as they come. Don’t expect anything approaching Samsung’s level of creative design, as exhibited in the S Pen; this is the kind of stylus you’d buy for a fiver at a random phone shop.. It’s very light and thin, and quite comfortable to wield for extended periods, but you don’t get any shortcut buttons and there’s no kind of pressure sensitivity. If you’re looking for a proper creative tool, we’d recommend the Galaxy Note instead.. That said, the Stylus 2 does at least recognise when you pull the pen free of its sheath, and displays a list of apps that make use of the stylus. This includes the kinds of note and sketch apps that you’d expect. And the Stylus 2 also packs plenty of other LG tweaks sat on top of Android Marshmallow, the same kind of stuff found on other handsets like the LG G5. This includes the UX interface, which by default annoyingly ditches Android’s apps tray. Thankfully this can be corrected in the settings (with a brief download required).. LG’s Stylus 2 uses the rather creaky Snapdragon 410 processor, a budget chipset found on some of last year’s cheapy handsets like the Moto G. Again, we’d hoped that LG would use some more modern tech like the Snapdragon 430 (launched at the end of 2015) instead, as the Stylus 2 already feels like a handset that’s ageing.. Android runs smoothly enough for the most part, but there are awkward pauses when loading up apps and occasionally when closing them down again. We can see the Stylus 2 crawling in a year’s time, so definitely think twice before jumping into a 24-month contract.. However, when it comes to battery life, the Stylus 2 fares much better. I regularly enjoyed a day and a half of life, even with plenty of use (camera snaps, messing around in apps, constant messaging and so on). However, if you try and stream video non-stop, the Stylus 2 will be dead in under five hours, which isn’t a great result.. On the back of the Stylus 2 you’ll find a 13-megapixel camera complete with LED flash. Load up LG’s camera app and you’ll find that it’s pleasingly streamlined as usual, with the choice of a very simple point-and-shoot interface or a version with on-screen options, for fiddling with camera settings like the flash toggle and HDR mode.. My test photos came out well, with plenty of detail on offer, although they did occasionally feel quite lifeless. Still, different lighting conditions are handled well, and you don’t get grain creeping into your shots until thngs get properly dim. When that happens, the LED flash does a decent job of lighting up faces without turning everyone into ghostly apparitions.. The Stylus 2’s 8-megapixel selfie camera is a solid snapper, producing bright, attractive photos. You can activate the lens with a pump of your fist, making it easy to take shots at maximum reach, and even in low light it copes admirably well.. You can also shoot up to Full HD video on the rear camera, and my test footage looked fine when viewed back on a big screen. There’s no image stabilisation to cut back the judder when you’re moving about, however, so try not to walk and shoot at the same time.. The LG Stylus 2 is a weird beast. It’s essentially a cut-price Galaxy Note handset, but with limited performance, a very basic stylus experience and a low-res screen. If it was only £150 then some of those flaws could perhaps be forgiven, but at £250 it’s overpriced and disappointing. Here’s hoping that the Stylus 2 Plus can correct the Stylus 2’s mistakes and step up as a proper Galaxy Note rival instead.. Thanks to MobileFun for our LG Stylus 2 review sample..
