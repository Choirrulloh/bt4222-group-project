Huawei P10 long-term review: Could have been better. Exclusive Mobiles.co.uk Deal: £25 Amazon voucher. After over four months with the Huawei P10, I can confirm the phone has aged very well. The 3200mAh battery hasn’t seriously deteriorated and continues to easily last a full day with average use.. Related: Huawei P11 news and rumours. The Kirin 960 CPU has also worn well and I still don’t have any issues with the P10’s performance. Using it as my main work and personal phone, the P10 still deals with multiple-tab web browsing, 3D gaming and video streaming chug- and stutter-free.. I can also personally attest to the P10’s durability. Despite experiencing more accidental drops than I’d care to admit, on a variety of different surfaces, ranging from carpets to pavements, the phone is without a dent. The only noticeable damage is a minor chip in my black unit’s top, which is only visible up close.. But, despite its continuing solid performance, I stand by my original opinion – the P10 is a capable smartphone, but it’s overshadowed and outdone by competing 2017 flagships.. When the P10 was originally released, its hefty price tag was already a sticking point, as it placed the handset in direct competition with stellar handsets such as the LG G6 ,. Samsung Galaxy S8 and HTC U11. Both those rival phones offered more advanced feature sets, better cameras and a variety of other perks. The only minor downside was that both are marginally more expensive.. Since then, however, the P10’s value has been further damaged thanks to the arrival of the OnePlus 5T , which costs £50 less than the P10. The OnePlus also offers a pretty impressive array of features normally seen on much more expensive phones.. These include a powerful Snapdragon 835 CPU and nifty dual-camera system that pairs a regular Sony IMX 398 sensor with a telephoto lens. Though it’s not perfect, this setup is a noticeable step up from the P10’s – which takes an alternative route, pairing a regular RGB sensor with a monochrome one to mixed effect.. The end result is that, for now, I’d still recommend buyers either consider shelling out a little more for the larger P10 Plus, which has better specs, or consider a non-Huawei phone such as the OnePlus 5T..

The P10 is the successor to Huawei’s P9 flagship, which in my mind was the firm’s finest handset to date.. It continues the company’s push to dominate the camera market and features a refined version of the “designed by Leica” dual-camera setup seen on its predecessor. This, plus a few subtle but important design and hardware improvements, makes the P10 look like it could be a valid rival to Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S8 and the excellent LG G6 ..

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. With its retail price set at £550 in the UK, however, the P10 is one of the most expensive phones ever made by Huawei. Couple this with the fact that for only €50 more it’s possible to pick up the better-specced “Plus” variant of the P10 (UK pricing yet to be confirmed), and the P10’s overall appeal is hampered, making it a good as opposed to perfect choice for premium buyers.. Design-wise, the P10 looks more like an iPhone 7 than a Huawei phone. Some of the coloured variants, such as the blue version, differentiate themselves by sporting a textured finish. Overall, though, were it not for the appearance of a USB Type-C – not Lightning – port at the bottom of the handset and the Leica and Huawei branding on its rear, you could easily mistake the P10 for an Apple phone.. Some will bemoan the lack of originality; for me, this isn’t too much of an issue since the P10 ticks all the right boxes when it comes to functionality.. The metal exterior feels suitably solid, and the use of Gorilla Glass 5 on the front screen should offer reasonable scratch-resistance – although I’d still refrain from dropping it in a pocket with your keys.. The P10’s 7mm thickness and 142g weight make it super-comfortable to hold, even for folk with small hands. I’m also pleased to see the phone has a microSD card slot, which will enable users to add a further 256GB of space to the basic 64GB built-in storage.. My only slight quibble is that Huawei has opted to position the fingerprint scanner on the P10’s front, as I’ve always found a rear placement more intuitive in use. The scanner on the P9 was a particularly fine example, with placement exactly where my index finger naturally fell when holding it.. Huawei has partially made up for this by adding some advanced control options to the P10’s scanner. A short press acts as the standard Back button, while a long press brings you back to the homescreen. Swiping left or right will bring up the apps Overview screen.. The company claims the button will be easier to use than Android’s on-screen inputs, thanks to the addition of a custom Ultra Response feature. The feature reportedly tracks your usage habits so it can intelligently predict where your finger will go next, reacting preemptively and thus reducing latency.. Such functionality sounds useful, and on first receiving the P10 I did use the features out of novelty. But following a week with the handset, I didn’t notice a huge difference in response times and reverted to using Android’s on-screen commands – which is what I imagine most people will do. Huawei has loaded the P10 with a 5.1-inch, 1080p resolution display. On paper, this is a marked step down from the P10 Plus, which comes with a 5.5-inch with a 2K resolution display. However, in real-world use I didn’t encounter any issues with the P10’s display.. Many flagships, such as the Galaxy S7 , may have made the jump to Quad-HD, but the truth is, most people won’t notice the difference in pixel count. The P10’s 432ppi (pixels per inch) mean that it’s all but impossible to discern individual pixels and icons, and text looks universally sharp.. The use of an IPS-NEO panel results in blacks that are better than those on regular IPS screens – and improved viewing angles – although they’re not as deep and inky as they are on phones with AMOLED screens. In addition, whites are clean and colours are neither overcooked nor too cool.. Maximum brightness levels are excessively high, to the point I generally found myself having to set the phone to between 30-40% brightness to use it comfortably.. All in all, the P10’s screen is pretty good – although at this price, I wouldn’t expect anything less.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

By aditya sharma | 28 Feb 2017. Its indeed sad,mobile companies despite having a market vision are not giving good battery power which is a key bottleneck for a phone usage.If you have 21MP cameras ,kreon decacore processors and battery you specify is 2800 mah,does it really make sense.With emerging trends of internet use ,any company who doesnot makes a phone battery even 4000 mah is simply doing a crime in my opinion..

The Huawei P10 looks to be a great phone you'll love if you're upgrading from a two year old handset, but not much has changed here to keep true Huawei fans thrilled by the flagship line.. Huawei P10 price and release date Launched in the UK and Australia in March 2017 for £569.99/AU$899 Huawei has no plans to release the P10 in the US More expensive than the Huawei P9 was at launch. Key features New fingerprint scanner offers a new way to navigate your phone Improved camera system includes a portrait mode Design More rounded design makes the Huawei P10 look like an iPhone 6S Easier to handle than some other Huawei devices Fingerprint scanner on the front changes the way you hold the phone Want to protect your phone? Here are the best Huawei P10 cases Display Full HD 5.1-inch display that's bright and colorful Looking for a higher resolution? Go for the P10 Plus Best Huawei P10 tips and tricks. Huawei has been making consistently great phones for a number of years now, yet has struggled to establish itself as a household name in western markets – and its latest flagship, the Huawei P10, offers a glimpse as to why that’s the case.. The Huawei P10 is a culmination of everything the company has been doing right, with a few minor tweaks from the P9 to make sure it keeps up with the big guns such as Apple and Samsung.. But they are minor tweaks, and the P10 is a limited upgrade – and if you're already running a recent phone from the company you may not be inspired to upgrade, although you might want to check out the slightly larger and better-specced Huawei P10 Plus instead.. The Huawei P10 is now out in the UK and Australia, and it wasn't a cheap device at launch. It originally cost £569.99/AU$899, but we've now seen the device drop down a lot.. In the UK we've seen it as low as £350 with monthly deals starting off at less than £30 a month for 1GB deals. Huawei is also selling the P10 in Australia too, but it still costs around AU$899 from Optus, Vodafone and Virgin Mobile.. We can expect to see the price drop even further now the follow up Huawei P20 is heavily rumored and may even launch at MWC 2018 .. Video our video of the Huawei P10 hands-on below.. You won't be able to buy this phone in the US, however, and it's not currently clear why the company isn't launching the P10 there. If you're in the US you may want to seek out an imported model, as we expect it to work with AT&T and T-Mobile, but it probably won't work with Verizon and Sprint.. Weight : 145g Dimensions : 145.3 x 69.3 x 7mm OS : Android 7.0 Nougat Screen size : 5.1-inch Resolution : 1920 x 1080 CPU : HiSilicon Kirin 960 RAM : 4GB of RAM Storage : 32/64GB Battery : 3,200mAh Rear camera : 12MP + 20MP dual lens Front camera : 8MP. The fingerprint scanner on the Huawei P10 is a big highlight of this phone. This is the first time Huawei has put its security scanner on the front of the phone for a few iterations. It sits just below the screen, although despite it looking like the home key on a Samsung device you can’t press this down, as it’s not a button. There are no capacitive keys on the front of the phone either; instead navigation between screens and apps is all controlled through the fingerprint sensor.. Huawei says this is to try and create a more streamlined design – something it calls 'organic minimalism'.. To move around the interface you’ll need to push down on the fingerprint sensor for around a second, but to go back one step you’ll just tap it quickly. You can also swipe to the right to open the previous apps screen.. When you first pick up the P10 and try to use this, it feels convoluted. After a week of use, we found it became much easier to understand, and actually a little faster than moving between three different keys at the bottom of your phone, as on other devices.. Just be warned, you’ll likely spend your first few days getting frustrated, as you’ve tapped the button to go to your home screen but instead find yourself returning to a web page.. As with its other phones Huawei is putting a big focus on the camera for the P10. There’s a dual camera setup on the rear of the P10 – that’s a 20MP monochrome sensor working in tandem with a 12MP color shooter.. Images are taken on both cameras and the phone combines both – the black and white sensor is claimed to improve detail in the image, while the 12MP sensor captures the color. We’ve found that in good lighting the P10’s camera is better than the P9’s, but it’s not doing anything remarkably different.. There’s also a new Leica-branded Portrait mode, which improves facial tracking and includes a beautification mode – we’ll tell you more about this in the upcoming camera section.. The Huawei P10 looks like an iPhone 6S – there’s no escaping that. It’s striking how similar the design of the P10 is to the iPhone 6S, enough so that we’ve had many people mistake the device for an iPhone.. If you’re a fan of the iPhone design but not Apple’s iOS, the Huawei P10 could well be a great buy for you.. Huawei P10 (left) next to the Huawei P9. Despite looking like Apple’s device, much of the design language on the P10 is also similar to the Huawei P9. It’s a slightly more comfortable phone to use than that phone, thanks to rounded corners that make it a touch more comfortable in the hand.. The power button is slightly indented, on the right-hand side of the phone, and feels different enough to the volume rocker that you won’t confuse the two when the phone’s in your pocket.. Along the bottom edge of the phone sit the single speaker driver, the USB-C port and the 3.5mm headphone jack. Huawei is keeping the manual headphone jack for now, unlike some of the competition, so you’ll be able to continue using wired headphones with this phone.. The back of the phone is a full-metal unibody once again, but this time there are a few different effects to choose from.. Huawei has added two 'dazzling' color options to the range for the Huawei P10, which give a reflective metal effect and look great.. The technology behind this is called 'Hyper Diamond Cut'; it means you won’t leave any fingerprints on the back of the phone, and it will also look beautiful from afar.. The phone pictured throughout this review doesn't sport the 'Hyper Diamond Cut' finish, unfortunately. The regular metal Huawei P10 looks a little boring compared to the new dazzling version, but it does come in five color options.. These are black, green, silver, gold and rose gold. Huawei is also included a White Ceramic version, which is still made of metal but comes with a ceramic-effect finish on top.. If you’re upgrading to the Huawei P10 we certainly think you’ll be taken with either the Dazzling Blue or Dazzling Gold options, as each looks quite different to anything else you can buy right now.. While we’re not reviewing either of the ‘Dazzling’ options, but we have had the chance to hold them and they look and feel very nice indeed.. The design of the Huawei P10 does feel a little slicker than previous Huawei phones, and a better overall package. It’s easy to hold this device – the Huawei Mate 9 can be unwieldy for some.. But we’ll say it again… it’s really hard to shake the impression that this phone looks very like an iPhone.. Huawei has opted for a Full HD display on the P10, unlike competition from LG and Samsung that have QHD panels. And just a day after the P10 was announced, Sony showed off its brand new 4K panel phone, which offers a far better resolution than the P10.. Why Huawei has decided not to update the panel isn’t totally clear – we don’t think it’s a particularly bad thing, but if you do want a higher resolution you’ll want to buy the Huawei P10 Plus, which features a QHD resolution panel.. The screen is much the same as we saw on the Huawei P9, which we were mostly pretty happy with. It’s a touch smaller at 5.1 inches - the Huawei P9 was 5.2 inches.. You’ll be able to reach all corners of the display without stretching out your fingers. You may sometimes have to use both hands to use a particular feature, but it’s a comfortable experience.. The panel itself offers 432 pixels per inch, which means everything you watch on here looks sharp, despite it not being a QHD panel. We also found the display to be super-bright, which is great if you’re often using your phone in strong sunlight.. Next Page What’s it like to use?.

The Good The compact Huawei P10 is comfortable to hold and looks great. Its camera is awesome and it has oodles of power.. The Bad It's expensive, the touch-sensitive navigation key is awkward to use and it's not waterproof.. The Bottom Line Despite some criticisms, the P10's lovely design and brilliant camera make it a very compelling choice -- as long as you can stomach the cost.. The P10 may just be my favourite phone that Huawei has ever made.. It's the design that really struck a chord for me, an all-metal body that mixes highly polished edges with an attractive micro-etched finish on the back. My review model came in a cool blue hue, which sets it apart from the black and grey phones that usually land on my desk.. But the best part for me is the size. With a screen measuring 5.1 inches, the P10 is much smaller than most flagship phones. That makes it fit comfortably in my hand. It doesn't bulge out my jeans when it's in my pocket and you won't need experimental surgery to extend your thumb to text one-handed.. It has the same dual-lens setup that's on last year's P9 , albeit with increased resolutions. One lens takes shots in colour and the other only shoots in black and white, with both delivering great performances. Colour shots are rich, vibrant and well exposed. I'm impressed with how quickly the phone focuses and at how well it balances very bright and very dark areas in a scene.. It's the black and white mode that I like the most, though. While you can simply apply black and white effects to any photo after you shoot it, the P10's dedicated monochrome sensor delivers beautiful results with gorgeous contrast without any extra tweaking. It's great fun to head into town with the monochrome mode enabled and see how the world looks in black and white.. And the 8-megapixel front-facing camera is more than sufficient to capture your most embarrassing grinning selfies.. Beyond the camera, the P10 has a decent 64GB of storage and an octa-core processor that easily handled the demanding tasks I threw at it. For example, photo editing in Snapseed was a breeze and it tackled graphically demanding games like Asphalt Xtreme without breaking a sweat.. The battery is extremely capable too, lasting an impressive 15 hours on our rundown tests. By comparison, the Google Pixel XL managed just under 14 hours on the same test, while the OnePlus 3T almost got to 17. With reasonably careful use you'll get a day out of the P10 (keep your gaming and video streaming until you're near a plug), but you'll almost certainly want to give it a full charge overnight..

Huawei took to the stage at MWC 2017 to show off its 2017 flagship phone, the. It has a huge focus on portrait photography and design, but does it perform as well as Huawei claims? We’ve spent some time with the Huawei P10, and here’s what we thought. Following the MWC 2017 announcement, the Huawei P10 is now available to buy in the UK after. a 31 March 2017 launch, and will set consumers back around £569.99 on pay as you, although the exact price is dependent on the retailer.. and Carphone Warehouse are both stocking the flagship on PAYG at the time of writing.. This makes the Huawei P10 a fairly cheap flagship smartphone, especially when you consider that the likes of the LG G6 costs £699, and the Samsung Galaxy S8 costs £689.. As with the Huawei P9 , a number of UK networks offer the Huawei P10 on contract. EE is offering P10 contracts, along with Vodafone. We’ve also had confirmation from Three that it’ll offer the phone on contract, but the website is yet to be updated. Huawei P10 vs Huawei P10 Plus comparison review .. Huawei has a reputation for offering high-end design and materials in its smartphones, and the Huawei P10 is no different. Featuring a refined design reminiscent of the Huawei P9, there are subtle changes to the design of the smartphone that make it stand out from the crowd, following an “organic minimalism” design philosophy.. Everything’s a little bit ‘neater’ on the P10, and the curved but slightly elongated edges of the smartphone give it a distinctive look, while also being comfortable to hold in the hand (vital for a 5.1in smartphone) and less slippery to hold.. It’s also much smaller than other 5.1in smartphones on the market, measuring in at 145.3 x 69.3 x 7mm and weighing in at only 145g.. The most obvious change, compared to the Huawei P9? The staggering number of colour options available. Huawei wanted to offer consumers more than just the standard black, silver or gold colour options, and worked alongside Pantone to offer the Huawei P10 in vibrant and eye-catching colours like dazzling blue and greenery.. In fact, the P10 comes in eight different colours: graphite black, dazzling blue, dazzling gold, rose gold, greenery, white ceramic, mystic silver and prestige gold, although not all colours will be headed to the UK.. It’s not just the colours that are new, as Huawei has also introduced a new finish: the hyper-diamond cut, available on the dazzling blue and dazzling gold colour options. It’s different to the standard sandblasted finish, creating tiny ridges along the length of the rear of the P10.. It’s a unique look when compared to other 2017 flagships so far, and provides an interesting (in a good way) texture to run your fingers across when holding the phone. Huawei also claims that the finish should reduce the smudges and fingerprints that appear on the rear of the device, but we’re unable to confirm this.. Huawei has also moved the fingerprint scanner from the rear of the device to the front, and in doing so removed the ability to easily take selfies without needing to awkwardly tap the screen – but we’ll come to that in more detail below, as there’s reasoning behind the move. What is cool is that the scanner is built directly into the glass, with no seam lines at all.. Huawei Watch 2 UK release date, pricing and specs. In terms of the display, the Huawei P10 packs a Full HD 5.1in IPS display with a resolution of 1920x1080, compared to the P10 Plus’s 5.5in WQHD IPS display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440. However, due to slim bezels and smart design from Huawei, the phone isn’t overly bulky and is relatively easy to use one-handed. As with most Huawei displays, it’s colourful and crisp, although we’ve not found it to be as bright as previous Huawei smartphones.. Huawei put a huge focus on the design and software capabilities of the Huawei P10 during its MWC 2017 announcement, but there’s a good reason behind that: the internals of the smartphone are almost identical to that of the Huawei Mate 9, which was released back in November 2016.. Just like the Huawei Mate 9, the Huawei P10 features the latest Kirin 960 2.4GHz octa-core processor coupled with a Mali G71 GPU, 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage. Those looking for a little more oomph can opt for the P10 Plus, which features 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Of course, as with all Huawei devices, the P10 also features a microSD card slot that’ll allow you to expand the storage by up to 256GB.. That’s not a bad thing though, as in our Huawei Mate 9 review we described the processing power of the smartphone as stunning, and it’s a similar story with the P10: it’s blisteringly fast, with not even the slightest sign of lag at any point during our time with the smartphone. We’ll come to that in more detail in our benchmark section below.. However, despite the high-end internals, Huawei has confirmed that the P10 isn’t DayDream compatible, although it wouldn’t go into detail about the reason. It’s not the only area that the P10 is lacking either, as unlike many other flagship smartphones, the Huawei P10 doesn’t offer any kind of water resistance.. It might not be a huge deal to some, but when the likes of the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 offer at least 30 mins of protection when submerged in up to 1m of water, it’s odd that Huawei didn’t try to match it.. Battery life is another area where, sadly, the Huawei P10 hasn’t managed to live up to expectations. Despite featuring a 3,200mAh battery that is larger than average for a ~5in smartphone, we’re yet to see a full day’s usage from a single charge. As an example, after two and a half hours of use (messaging, listening to music and checking social media), the battery dropped down from 100 to 64 percent. While it’s better than previous Huawei smartphones, it still has a way to go before we become completely untethered from the wall.. The good news is that thanks to Quick Charging technology, the Huawei P10 charges incredibly quickly, going from dead to 30 percent in little over 10 minutes. A full charge takes a little longer, but is noticeably quicker than those without quick charging capabilities, like the iPhone 7 Plus with its 2900mAh battery.. The catch is that you must use not only the supplied plug but also the cable, as the Quick Charging technology is built into the charger rather than the phone itself.. In terms of performance, we think the Huawei P10 is pretty impressive. We’ve had the smartphone for a while now, and can say without a shadow of a doubt that it’s much faster than last year’s Huawei P9, and could be one of the most powerful Huawei smartphones currently available. Everything is instant, from swiping through menus to switching apps and even opening the camera, and we’re yet to experience any kind of lag, even when playing processor-hungry games.. We can back that up with stats, too. In Geekbench 4, which tests the CPU performance of the smartphone, the Huawei P10 managed a single-core score of 1926, and a multi-core score of 5513. This shows huge improvements compared to last year’s P9, which managed scores of 1726 and 4710 respectively. It also outperformed the OnePlus 3T, the Google Pixel and even the LG G6 by similar amounts, although it couldn’t quite outperform the iPhone 7.. We next ran the GFXBench benchmark, which is split into four sequences, each with varying resolution, textures, particle effects, etc, to test the graphical performance of the smartphone. We’ll focus on T-Rex (lowest) and Car Chase (highest) here, but you can see a full breakdown of the results in the below infographic.. The Huawei P10 managed to score 53fps in T-Rex, and 12fps in Car Chase. While it offers improvements compared to the Huawei P9, the P10 isn’t quite powerful enough to beat many of its rivals, with the OnePlus 3T, Google Pixel and iPhone 7 all outperforming the flagship.. Finally, we ran the JetStream benchmark, which looks to test the speed and performance of smartphone browsers. In the case of the Huawei P10, the default browser is Google Chrome. Like in other tests, the P10 performed well compared to other smartphones with a score of 58.2, but was nowhere near beating the iPhone 7 with an incredible score of 160.2.. You can see a complete breakdown of our benchmark results compared to other flagship smartphones below:. Of course, apart from design, the biggest draw of the Huawei P10 is the cameras. Huawei has made a few changes that it claims will make the rear-facing dual-lens setup perform better than ever, and there’s a few notable changes to the selfie camera too.. Let’s start with the rear-facing camera. It’s a similar setup to that of the Huawei Mate 9, featuring one 12Mp colour sensor and one 20Mp black and white sensor, which should help it to capture more light and perform better in dark environments. There’s also optical image stabilisation for sharper pictures, and an f/2.2 aperture.. The Leica-branded lenses have also been improved when compared to the Huawei P9, which helps capture clearer images. General photography is impressive, with the Huawei P10 capturing decent amounts of detail and light, although the quality does slightly drop with the light.. Alongside the improved camera, Huawei introduces Portrait mode with the Huawei P10. As the name suggests, the mode is designed for use when taking photos of people. Huawei claims that it features advanced facial recognition, thanks to the dual-lens setup, and that the phone can identify and track 190 different facial points in a 3D space for snaps that are always in focus.. It doesn’t stop there either, as it tracks your face, offers automatic portrait enhancements (varying levels from 0-10, much like the Beauty mode on some Androids), and even tweaks the lighting for the best possible outcome. According to Huawei, it highlights the contours and facial features, while fading the background with the wide aperture effect.. That sounds amazing, right? While we initially thought it was too good to be true, after snapping quite a few pictures of colleagues, we can confirm that the mode does have a positive effects on photos.. While the airbrushing is a little over the top in places, photos taken using the Portrait mode are of a high standard with great lighting and boast a professional look. Don’t take our word for it though, take a look at the below photo and judge for yourself (click to enlarge).. Our only complaint? The bokeh effect isn’t always 100 percent accurate, and unlike with the wide aperture mode, there’s no way to edit or remove it once the photo has been taken.. The front facing camera has also had an upgrade: it’s Leica-branded, just like the rear-facing cameras, although not a dual-lens setup like rumours suggested. What it does have is a new sensor that Huawei claims lets in double the amount of brightness compared to older Huawei phones, and features a wider dynamic range. It also offers Portrait mode support, offering high-quality selfies on-the-go.. That’s not all either, as the front-facing camera is smart enough to identify whether you’re taking a selfie or a group photo, and will adjust the angle accordingly (wide-angle for group, standard for selfie). It works really well, although we’d prefer to have an on-screen button to toggle between the two settings as it doesn’t always adjust right away.. Let’s talk a little bit about the software on the Huawei P10. Like many other 2017 flagships, the P10 ships with the latest version of Android: Android 7.0, aka Nougat.. However, it’s not a vanilla implementation as Huawei is also throwing in EMUI 5.1, the latest version of Huawei’s Emotion UI. It brings with it many of the improvements offered with EMUI 5.0, like machine learning for better performance and an overhauled design, along with a few new features too.. Let’s talk about One Button Control, as it was briefly mentioned when talking about the fingerprint scanner of the smartphone. While Huawei used to use the rear-facing fingerprint scanner of the likes of the Huawei P9 and Mate S to activate the camera shutter, and provide access to the notification shade with a single swipe, these options are now gone (much to our disappointment).. Now the scanner lives on the front of the device, it offers standard Home button capabilities, and then some.. Rather than just using it to return to the home screen, the scanner has all three function buttons that Android users need within a single button. To go back a step, tap it. If you want to go home, tap and hold it. If you want to access the multitasking menu, simply swipe from left to right.. Once you’ve broken the habit of a lifetime and stopped reaching to the left and right of the Home button to go Home or open the multi-tasking menu, you’ll find that it’s an intuitive way to interact with the smartphone, and we’d love for it to become available on other Androids.. Huawei also offers integration with Quik, the GoPro owned app that takes photos and videos and automatically edits them, on the P10. Just head into the Gallery app and you’ll find options to select media from an event or day, then Quik analyses everything and edits it together in a short, punchy video ready for sharing on social media.. The Huawei P10 is an impressive beast – it’s gorgeous, powerful and the dual cameras are a huge improvement over the 2016 flagship, the P9. Portrait mode works better than expected, photos are crisp, vibrant and detailed and even the selfie camera has had a meaningful upgrade.. Huawei’s EMUI, one of the most controversial Android overlays, is much better to use than with previous smartphones, and offers machine learning algorithms that should speed up your phone the more you use it. Even the price is competitive at £569.. The only downside? Despite being of a high capacity, the battery life of the P10 isn’t great, and some users may find that they have to plug it in to top it up once or twice a day, just to get through..

CNET también está disponible en español.. Huawei's new P10 phones: Dual Leica cameras, 3D face detection and plenty of Pantone. The P10 and P10 Plus have new portrait modes and lots of colors, plus the promise of 3D face detection.. by February 26, 2017 5:30 AM PST. The Huawei P10, Leica's picture pal. Huawei P10 brings more color and two Leica cameras. 145.3 by 69.3 by 6.98 mm Colors: Ceramic White, Dazzling Blue, Dazzling Gold, Prestige Gold, Graphite Black, Mystic Silver, Rose Gold, Greenery Finishes: High Gloss, Hyper Diamond-Cut, Sandblast 5.1-inch FHD (P10) or 5.5-inch WQHD (P10 Plus) Gorilla Glass 5 display Huawei Kirin 960 octacore processor Mali G71 Octa-core GPU Cameras: front-facing 8-megapixel (f/1.9), rear Leica Dual-Camera 2.0 (20-megapixel monochrome and RGB), OIS (P10: f/2.2, P10 Plus: f/1.8) Batteries: 3,200mAh (P10), 3,750mAh (P10 Plus), both with fast charging Android 7.0 not water resistant (The P10 Plus is IPX3 rated, which is "splash resistant," but don't dunk either phone). Huawei's newest phones, the P10 and P10 Plus, are smaller-screened versions of the giant Mate 9 , in a sense, with dual rear cameras. They were announced at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, but we got to try them out a few days earlier in New York. (The venue was somewhat ironic given you can't buy Huawei's newest phones in the US. But maybe, someday, the P10 and its fancy cameras will make its way over.). They come in a variety of new Pantone color options -- eight, to be exact -- and three finishes: high gloss, sandblast and "hyper diamond-cut." I held a few models: the hyper diamond-cut blue has a shimmery micro-etched finish.. The Huawei P10, Leica's picture pal. The P10 and P10 Plus look, for the most part, like iPhones. The slim designs mean no rear camera bump, and the metal backs and smooth edges mean a comfortable feel. Like those phones, the P10 also has a significant bezel above and below the display.. The most interesting twist to Huawei's new phones might be its promise of an enhanced portrait mode. Twin 20-megapixel Leica cameras on the rear and a new image processor enable 3D face detection with up to 190 points of recognition. Huawei's using this to make prettier portraits and depth-of-field bokeh-style camera effects.. It was hard to tell how good it was during a few test snaps, and it didn't exactly blow me away. The dual Leica cameras in this model are running an enhanced 2.0 system, with improved image processing, according to Huawei. Also new to this phone is an updated version of Huawei's Emotion UI 5.1, which aims to fine-tune the phone by learning user preferences.. Good news here is that these smaller P10 phones seem to pack a lot of the power of the larger Mate 9, using the same Kirin 960 octacore processors. Imagine the P10 as a portable powerhouse alternative, with potentially decent battery life (3,200mAh in the 10 and 3,750mAh in the 10 Plus). Storage options will expand from 32 to 128GB, with 4GB of RAM on the P10 and up to 6GB on the Plus, depending on configuration.. The P10 and P10 Plus also move the rear fingerprint sensor to the front, turning it into a swipeable all-in-one home button/navigator. Moving my thumb left and right pulled up recent apps, but the extra thumbwork might be too much twiddling for some.. Prices and release dates weren't announced at the time of our briefing..

Huawei P10 Leica Cowhide Genuine Leather Cover Case. · 28 March 2017 ·. buy it at : https://www.vopmart.com/huawei-p10.html. Paul Darren Bentley · 15 hours ago. All the reviews online said at £550 you would be better off with iphone 7 or a galaxy S7 because you got more for your money. Well now in the UK the price has dropped to £349. Well at this price it mu ... st make it one of the best value phone around! I have my P10 for a month now and loving it. I originally bought it because I was sick of repairing phone screen (will never buy Sony again!) The P10 has the latest Gorilla 5 glass which only the expensive phones have. So what else do I love about it. Feels right in the hand and pocket. At under 7mm it is sleek. Gorilla 5 glass with a metal case. (Which halfwitts but a glass back on a phone, is the cracked look in vogue at the moment?) 3. Everything works fast, no delay. Even connects to mobile internet in areas where my other mobile struggle. Well who wants the old one? 5. Although I have not had time to play with all the advanced camera settings the camera works great. Love the quick access with finger print recognitio n and quick voice dial. The fingerprin t recognitio n works instantly and never fails even at any angle. You can program more than one finger/ thumb. When the phone is locked, press the down volume key for two seconds and the phone will vibrate, speak the name of the person you want to phone and it dials it with in a few seconds. I have seen someone try to do this on an iphone and it takes ages. I have never run out of battery charge yet and it charges quickly. When I looked into this phone, I was almost put off by it when I read the online reviews. Who writes this crap! They can't even get their facts right, like it has no app draw. YES IT DOES...it is just turned off by default and can be easily turned on. No review has bothered to review since the phone has dropped in price where iphones and galazy's have held their price. Hauwei (pronounce d "Wah-way") is an up and coming company who I am glad to say are "challengi ng the up there own arse" companies like apple & Samsung. "love this phone!!!!" See more. Félix Lamoureux · 6 November 2017. I just bought the Huawei P10 and for the past month i have been going trought serious issues with the rear Camera. The focus doesnt work anymore and all my pictures are Blur. At first I was a bit sce ... ptical to switch from my samsung S7 to an other brand. But the salesman basicly sold it to me saying the Huawei P10 had the best camera on the market. I am very much disappoint ed about this phone especially that i purchased it for the camera specs. Ramona Kun-Kuti · 13 February 2018. Worst purchase ever, after 2 months no auto focus on the camera and 1 day later the whole phone died. They claim water damage, even though no liquid even came close to my phone. at a cop of coffee anywhere near the P10 can create water damage. So if you like coffee or ant other hot beverage, don't buy this phone, you will regret it! #huawei#hu aweip10#hu aweiworstp honeever See more. Simon Lienhard · 24 January 2018.

Huawei P10 review: still a good choice in 2018. P10 too pricey? Consider the Honor 9. Samsung, watch out! How Huawei will take the throne. At MWC 2017, Huawei presented the. the P10 the successor of the popular P9.. With a promising processor, an optimized dual camera and sleek design, the new device impressed many at the time.. But it's 2018 and technology keeps moving on. Could the Huawei P10 still be the right phone for you. Huawei P10 release date and price. Huawei presented its P10 device last February at the Mobile World Congress 2017. available in Graphite Black, Mystic Silver and Prestige Gold but blue and red color options were later added.. In the box, which opens outwards on both sides from the middle, there is a set of earphones (that look. made by Apple), a 4.5V-5A SuperCharge charger, a USB type-C cable and the usual SIM and microSD card tool - all in addition to the actual device of course, which is covered by a transparent protective film.. Huawei P10 design and build quality. The rear of the phone is reminiscent of the new iPhone. The P10 has smoother corners than the P9. The antennas are well camouflaged in the Huawei P10, disappearing around the camera and along the bottom edge. Fingerprints show up more obviously on the black Huawei P10.. Fingerprint sensor on the front or back? Huawei's P10 and P9 compared. The fingerprint reader is located on the front of the Huawei P10. The Huawei P10 doesn't have IP 67/68 certification. The power button is red on the Huawei P10. IP67? IP68? Find out if your smartphone is protected against water and dust. By using the fingerprint reader button to navigate, you can enjoy the display even more. The Huawei P10 has an IPS panel with full HD resolution. FullHD? OLED? LCD? Smartphone displays explained. In the display menu, you can change the temperature of the color and activate eye protection. Scheduled update to Android 8.0 Oreo. In general, the system works flawlessly and efficiently. The most useful tricks you can do. App twin allows you to have two WhatsApp accounts. How Huawei and GoPro joined forces for the Quik app. Huawei and GoPro have joined forces through the Quik app. Different customization options are available in the Huawei P10's themes. It won't beat 2018's flagships, but is still great for everyday use. How does AI really improve your smartphone?. 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 3.1. 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 3.0. 3D Mark Ice Storm Unlimited ES 2.0. Middling sound quality Strong dual camera that gets weaker in the dark. What are the real advantages of a dual camera?. The Huawei P10 inherited the round camera from the Mate 9. The camera's software has been optimized compared to the Mate 9. Photos taken with the P10 compared to other devices (LG G6 or Pixel) are a bit duller and less detailed. Pixel produces a more detailed images. Camera contest: how the P10 compares against the Google Pixel, Galaxy S7 Edge, and more. The Huawei P10 photo is a bit more dull than the LG G6. Photos taken with high ISO values are next to useless. with Wi-Fi deactivated, SIM inserted and brightness at 50 %, the P10 lasted 7 hours and 51 minutes. What about the design of the P10? Don't expect anything revolutionary with respect to its predecessor but some changes have been introduced, which are already visible at first glance. The metallic unibody offers sleeker lines with more rounded corners.. The back of the phone reveals the most obvious change from the P9: the fingerprint scanner has been moved to the front of the P10 and the back has been split into two sections. across the top containing the dual camera beside the flash and the area beneath is a matt housing that has the Huawei logo and the phone model number. The back of the P10 actually alludes to the iPhone in my opinion.. Overall, the back of the phone is nice but fingerprints show up quite obviously, like on the display - a top tip though, the silver variant masks the fingerprints better than the other color variants.. Upon closer inspection, the antennas are also on the back on the phone. These are very cleverly thought out as they are barely noticeable, subtly hidden around the camera module and along the bottom edge of the phone, unlike on some of the P10's competitors.. The front of the phone is protected with Gorilla Glass 5. In addition to the front camera lens is. and the speaker for phone calls, as well as. an oval-shaped fingerprint scanner, which can also be used to. I must admit that at first, I wasn't particularly overjoyed with the decision to move the scanner to the front because to me, the P9 was a very comfortable phone. But, after trying it out, my opinion was swayed. because it's fast as lightning and it's easy to use if the phone is lying on a surface, for example on the table. Unfortunately, it does get a little in the way if you. The volume control and the power buttons are located along the right side of the phone - you can feel and see these buttons thanks to the. The left side has micro SD and nano SIM card ports. On the bottom, like on the P9, there is a speaker, a USB type-C port and the mini-jack for headphones .. Another P10 variant has what's called a Hyper Diamond Cut finish. This model was made using technology that adds diamond dust to the final. The outside of the smartphone is made of thousands of tiny pyramids that play with the light to create particular reflections. This process makes the back of the phone more hardy and robust, making the device to stand out among its competitors.. The P10 has an elegant body that is nice to handle, as it. is sturdy and easy to use one-handed thanks to its 6.98 thickness (or thinness). Admittedly, a negative point for me is I don't like how the P10 looks;. design is based on the latest iPhone. I also don’t like that Huawei decided against the. IP67/IP68 certification, which at this point I would have expected to be a given since all its main rivals opted to have it, including the LG G6 , for example.. The 5.1-inch display of the Huawei P10 offers full HD resolution with 432 PPI and. an IPS panel, which the last generation had as well. The P10 doesn't support virtual reality unfortunately so if you're. particularly keen on getting Google Daydream , you'll have to go with a different device like the Lenovo Moto Z or the Google Pixel 2 .. The display is bright, even in direct sunlight. The colors are vibrant and clear, although the black isn't as pure as you'd expect to find on an AMOLED display. The panel offers good viewing angles, although there is now. the fingerprint scanner on the front. Just like the Mate 9 , the Honor 8 , and the P9 with the Nougat update,. you can now activate eye protection to reduce eye fatigue at night.. If you choose to use the fingerprint scanner to navigate, you'll have more space on the display. otherwise, you can always opt for the classic capacitive buttons. go to Settings> Navigation keys> Virtual navigation bar .. The P10's native software is Android Nougat with EMUI 5.1 but the update to Android Oreo and EMUI 8.0 is confirmed and scheduled. Get ready to enjoy the latest software innovations introduced by Google, customized by Huawei for your devices.. However, EMUI is more than just a software interface: the Chinese manufacturer has added significant improvements to the system in terms of optimizing Machine Learning as well as the RAM and internal memory. As background information, this involves the system analyzing how you use your phone and. learns which app(s) needs to be ready to be used. This whole process takes place on the device, offline and guarantees long-term performance.. Like for the Huawei Mate 9, the P10 includes all the innovations introduced by EMUI 5.0 and Android Nougat. This includes App twin (which allows you to use two WhatsApp and Facebook accounts on the same device), the ability to activate/deactivate the App drawer, smart notification management, suggestions within the setting menu, and other possibilities that you'll discover in our article on Nougat and EMUI 5.0 on the Huawei P9. Plus, we also have options like one-handed use, although I have to say, this function didn't. What distinguishes EMUI 5.1 from the 5.0 version available on the Mate 9 and the P9 is the camera's software, which has been improved and integrates a new GoPro photo album. Another popular video-editing app, Quik, is also pre-installed on the P10. videos that incorporate all your photos, which you can then easily share. The fingerprint scanner is fast but it doesn't work as a physical button. You can configure it to unlock your device and for other functions such as recent apps and the back button. You will however need to get used to this. you'll pick it up in no time.. On the other hand, it's worth highlighting the available gesture commands. For example, you can divide the screen in two by simply drawing a line down the middle. As always, the software has personalized options such as new backgrounds (albeit not very exciting ones, as is always the case with default options), widgets. In addition to Google apps, some of Huawei's services come pre-installed (Hicare, Wellbeing, HiGame, Themes, Phone management), as well as Tripadvisor, Instagram. if you don't want them there. If you have an iPhone or a Huawei phone,. it'll be much easier to transfer your data to your new P10 through the Clone app.. In general, the system works smoothly. Compared to older versions of the software, it's much cleaner and more advanced.. From a hardware standpoint, the P10 doesn't differ much more than. They both come equipped with a Kirin 960 octa-core 2.4 GHz processor with 4 GB of RAM, LPDDR4 and 64 GB of internal memory, which can be increased with a micro SD card. The graphics are run by an octa-core GPU Mali-MP8 and it also supports API Vulkan.. Unlike the Kirin 970 introduced with the Mate 10 Pro , the P10 chip does not integrate an artificial intelligence unit.. The fluidity of the system is undeniable. Multi-tasking doesn't have any downsides either. When it comes to games with demanding graphics, such as Real Racing 3, you can see where Vulkan shines. In the first versions of the system, there was some lag when we received notifications but it seems to have been solved with a small update.. As you can see from benchmark tests, the P10 isn't very different from the P9:. The antennas for your mobile connection have been improved as well. They now come with LTE cat. 12 with a 600 Mbit/s capacity, doubling the maximum speed. The P10 comes with Wi-Fi 2x2 MIMO, which improves your connection while you. and around obstacles and it supports the standard 802.11ac as well (11ad is not supported unfortunately). Bluetooth is supported up to version 4.2 as well as NFC .. For daily tasks, the speed and connections are incredible. Even when I used the phone under demanding conditions, playing games and other demanding apps, I didn't come across. The Huawei P10 only has one mono speaker located on the bottom of the phone. To really get the most out of music playback, you can use the earphones included in the box, which are actually decent. Maximum volume is loud and clear, as much during phone calls as during video calls. With games or videos, the mono speaker does a satisfactory job for a mono speaker. but you might miss hearing different things in each ear.. The P10 lacks FM radio and the possibility of using stereo audio as on the Mate 9.. The rear camera on the Huawei P10 has the same characteristics as the one on the Huawei Mate 9 -. a 20 MP camera with monochromatic resolution and another 12 MP (f/2.2) color-sensitive camera without optical image stabilizer. For the first time, all three cameras (front and back) come with Leica lenses.. The selfie camera on the Huawei P10 focuses on a fixed distance and comes with 8 MP and f/1.9. autofocus, we'd recommend the P10 Plus, which comes with that option. The aperture of the front camera is f/1.9. For groupies (group selfies), there's a way to open the capture angle even wider.. The main camera has Summarit range lenses, an aperture of f/2.2. You can zoom at 2x without losing quality, and the system uses the resolution difference between the sensors. Only the 12 MP sensor comes with optical image stabilizer.. The camera's software has been improved from the Mate 9 and they've introduced a new portrait mode that. can be used with both cameras, but you obviously get better results with the rear camera.. When lighting conditions aren't very good, colors are slightly changed, but this is a problem we find on several other devices as well. The beauty mode has also been improved to recognize "Caucasian". skin tones and adjust them to beauty standards.. In general, when taking daytime photos. with good lighting, the pictures came out with crisp detail. When the sun starts going down and light starts disappearing, colors and details start to suffer. If we compare photos from the P10 to those of the LG G6, the latter offers a better photo.. In the following images, you can see how the noise increases depending on the ISO. With higher ISO, noise is so high that the image quality is severely affected.. the Huawei P10 camera is good. but there are three or four smartphones out there that have better cameras, like the Google Pixel or the LG G6. Despite that, the P10 doesn't disappoint and has a large range of effects and filters to play with.. The average user will not be disappointed by the quality of the P10 shots and the fast and intuitive software that leaves room for filters, bokeh effect and Pro mode. Black and white shooting enthusiasts will appreciate the work done by the monochrome sensor.. With the Huawei P10 it is also possible to shoot videos in 4K at 30 frames or in Full HD at 30/60 frames per second.. The battery has been improved with respect to the P9, reaching 3,200 mAh in the Huawei P10. Thanks to the quick charge from the SuperCharge, 30 minutes will get your battery up to 50%.. The battery is capable of withstanding a full day of checking emails, making calls, looking at Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram, a few short game sessions. as well as watching some videos. Under more intensive use, you'll have to charge it overnight. To be honest, I was expecting a bit more from the P10 in terms of battery life.. In the settings menu, you can activate energy-saving modes "Economical" or "Ultra", which is recommended if. battery is almost dead and you need to keep your phone alive.. This function limits the background apps by decreasing or deactivating visual/audio functions and deactivating background email syncing.. Huawei also offers the option to decrease. In the PC Mark Battery test, with Wi-Fi deactivated, SIM switched on and 50% brightness set to 50%, our P10 yielded a result of 7 hours and 51 minutes. smartphone capable of giving you more autonomy, the Mate 10 Pro, Mate 9 or Nova Plus are the devices that could be right for you even if the latter is in the mid-range.. 145.3 x 69.3 x 6.98 mm. 1920 x 1080 pixels (432 ppi). Although it can't claim to be. original, its design is elegant and. ergonomic and it comes with a few perks. Having the P10 in your hand is a pleasure and during daily use, it doesn't lack in performance: the improved chip and optimized software run as promised. The camera leaves a bit to be desired when lighting conditions aren't ideal, especially when compared with better devices that are already available on the market. The battery will get you through the day with normal usage, but we're hoping that with future updates, it will gain even more life. In general, the P10 is a good device that handles daily tasks without problems. and will receive the update to Android Oreo. Overall, the P10 still meets the needs of most users in 2018. The work done by the Chinese brand on this device is excellent, with the unfortunate exceptions of the lack of IP68 certification and the absence of a unique standout feature. If you have a P9 in your pocket, the P10 offers something extra and shows the excellent work done by the Huawei. once again but the gap is not big enough to justify the upgrade. Better to wait for for the P20 instead!. I think Huawei phones have vastly improved. It's too bad the deal with AT&T & Verizon fell thru. The competition would have been very good here in the US. The thing I wonder with the money that Apple & Samsung have did they have anything to do with this deal? I say, yes!. Huawei P10 is really a fabulous smartphone. I really with you that "SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST AN UPGRADE". I will buy , Huawei phones are available in Bangladesh.. I've seen other reviews elsewhere (Juan at Pocketnow) that state this camera is nicer than the G6 in terms of pure camera output (not counting 'gimicks' like wide angle). It's also faired well in DXO Marks tests.. Thing is, that this device costs 150$ less than a LG g6 (that means 250$less than a new coming s8) and for that price, it is great buy compared to those... But then, there are so many devices that now cost additional 200$ less, like Huawei's own p9 wich i personally find better bang for the buck. Smartphones like p9, honor 8, op3t, s7 and some others are more than capable of doing everyday tasks...and it is hard to justify spending more money to a new flagship when last year's flagsips are almost the same ...not just as upgrade, i found same result by thinking of buying new device today... I would still go for cheaper last year's.. Buying last year's flagships can be a great idea. You get great specs for MUCH less money.. I like Huawei P10 but why do they use the LCD screens,they are behind in terms of the screens but once you actually see and feel this phone you will fall in love with it,the features are good and I think Huawei has a real winner despite the few features this phone lacks in.This is really a solid phone I personally like this phone I think that this is a good deal.If you don't believe me go and test it out,trust me this is a good phone,well for me it is an excellent phone.. The P10 Plus has a bigger (5.5") screen, which I'm a big fan of. You can check out our hands-on review here: https://www.androidpit.com/huawei-p10-plus-review. Will the offer of Dual Cameras have the edge over the Samsung Galaxy S8 models?thought Huawei would join the Edge screen craze and put more pressure on Samsung,but it early days of the year so we might get one released,. Andrew, are you a fan of dual cameras? The trend doesn't excite me very much.. I don't really think that it will an advantage because it is likely to have the same camera as the S7 which is not a bad camera,it is actually a very good camera.I don't really like the dual camera trend,I prefer the single camera..

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. by Peter Kostadinov. Android - Android + Huawei - Huawei +. 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction Right off the bat, the Huawei P10 has some large shoes to fill. Ahead of the new flagship device of the major China-based manufacturer lies an arduous task – to show that the P9 was not just a one-off success but truly representative of Huawei 's vision for what a smartphone should be. At first sight, the P10 is a meaningful albeit not drastic evolution over the P9 – it retains the overall design with just a couple of small, but important changes, has beefed up specs, and last but definitely not least, improves the winning dual, Leica-tuned camera setup. Sounds like quite the winning list of enhancements on paper, but let's not put the cart ahead of the horse and explore Huawei's new flagship up close and personal. Let's dive right into it! In the box: Huawei P10 4.5A charger USB Type-C cable Protective case In-ear headphones Information leaflets SIM ejector pin Design More of the same, but that's not a bad thing at all From a design standpoint, the P10 follows exactly in the P9's footsteps. Similarly sized and just a smidgen narrower, the P10 makes use of the very same all-metal design that Huawei used a year ago with only a few minor differences. Most notably, the fingerprint scanner that used to be in the back is now positioned at the front of the device, embedded in a new multi-functional home button. This button has other noteworthy functions, but we will address these later on. Depending on your stance towards fingerprint sensor positioning, you might praise or condemn Huawei for doing this. We are on the fence, though we admit that having the sensor in the front makes unlocking the phone a bit easier, especially if it's laying on a flat surface. If you like to use your phone with a single hand only, then the P10 scores a minor win over the P9 due to its narrower body. unless you opt for the Shimmer Blue version of the P10, which is the only one that comes with an array of tiny diamond-shaped ridges in the phone's metal body. These not only refract light in eye-catching ways, but also add a bit of grip. That's neat, since the regular non-textured versions of the P10 are as slippery as the P9. It would have been nice if Huawei had water-proofed the phone, given that all the major players in the industry are now doing just that. Probably with the P11, eh, Huawei?. Display The P10 has a bright but ill-calibrated display The P10 proudly boasts a 5.1-inch, 1080p Full HD display at the front, which works out a pixel density of 431ppi. The P10 also shines when it comes to maximum brightness – it hits 545 nits, making it perfectly legible outside, even in direct sunlight. On the other hand, the minimum brightness of 2 nits won't burn your retinas when you use the phone at night. Unfortunately, the display's color rendition is underwhelming. With a color temperature of 8258K, the display is noticeably cold and makes white colors appear bluer than they're supposed to, which is not okay. Yes, you can tweak the color temperature in the Settings menu (go into Display > Color temperature, and select the Warm option if you want more balanced colors, or Cold if you want even bluer shades of white), but we can't imagine many people figuring out on their own how to do that manually. Furthermore, colors appear way oversaturated, with lots of added vibrancy that's pretty far away from their real-life targets. That's particularly visible with green, yellow, and red colors. To add up to the overall display disappointment, gamma is also pretty poor - bright tones appear darker while dark tones appear brighter than they are supposed to. Clearly, display tweaking remains one of Huawei's Achilles heels.. 5.72 x 2.73 x 0.27 inches. 145.3 x 69.3 x 6.98 mm. 5.71 x 2.79 x 0.27 inches. 145 x 70.9 x 6.95 mm. 5.61 x 2.74 x 0.31 inches. 142.4 x 69.6 x 7.9 mm. 5.44 x 2.64 x 0.28 inches. 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software..

(Posts: 100; Member since: 02 Mar 2017). posted on 14 Mar 2017, 12:30. in response to #11 Hide. It can't score 8.5 because it is not an iPhone. But if Apple released the exact same phone with exact same specs it would have scored 9.0 minimum. In the reviews, they only look for Apple logo. If the phone has an Apple logo it automatically gets at least 9.0.. (Posts: 275; Member since: 29 Jun 2012). posted on 14 Mar 2017, 20:13.

Waterproofing isn't a necessity so putting it in CONS is unjustified. UI is beautiful in its own way. U r judgin it's UI based on what others does. Despite a boatload of features, it feels snappy and powerful. So putting this in cons is also unjustified. The only thing that is right in CONS section is ill-calibrated display. This device AT LEAST deserves 8.0 score for what it offers.. (Posts: 679; Member since: 23 Apr 2013). posted on 14 Mar 2017, 15:50. Well you have to include the not-an-iPhone handicap of - 2 points.. posted on 14 Mar 2017, 16:02. Think about it this way, you don't literally need a radio or bluetooth connectivity in a car. But, chances are you would rather have it than not. Waterproofing s not a necessity for the operation of a device, but it is a nice bit of security to have in case you drop it in liquid..

I agree with two of the three cons, except the display gripe, but I just don't completely understand PA's grading system. I imagine the majority of it is conjecture based on user preference and your ordinary benchmarks. However if that's the case, wouldn't a non-scoring method be more appealing? Or do you guys simply like pissing off fanboys? If it's the latter.......please, continue to grade the way you have lol.. (Posts: 751; Member since: 07 May 2014). posted on 14 Mar 2017, 13:23. I wasn't a Huawei phone until I bought an Honor 8 a few months ago. It is snappier than most of the other flagships, has better battery, the camera is also great for the price. I like the new EMUI more than any other Android UI, packs tons of features and still, offers snappy performance. I don't like the settings menu as it is very complex. Other than that it is a great UI. Considering how great things are on Honor 8, P10 should be much better. Some people like cold colors some like warm colors, EMUI lets you choose any of those, you can customize the display to your liking. Waterproofing is a CON in my opinion since I had to spend $80 dollars to replace the display on my Honor 8 when it was dropped into a pot full of cooking oil.. posted on 14 Mar 2017, 15:56. Wait, are you basically saying that you would rather pay the cost of replacement for killing a device by dropping it in liquid? Paying $80 to replace the display is worse than having to pay a couple hundred to replace the entire device? I... (Posts: 751; Member since: 07 May 2014). posted on 26 Mar 2017, 16:53. in response to #33 Hide. Forgot to add "no" before waterproofing. I meant to say No waterproofing is a CON. Why would I think of waterproofing as a CON since I have damaged two of my phones by dropping it into a liquid (Oil + Water). (Posts: 3170; Member since: 03 Oct 2015). posted on 14 Mar 2017, 17:45.

Every non-Android site is biased against Android. It's not like these phones ever have flaws, right? Yeah...no. "It doesn't take an Apple hater to see it.". Again, why wouldn't they be Apple biased.....you all KEEP COMING BACK FOR MORE. You can't complain about bias, sit there and comment about bias, and the up and accept it just to keep commenting. The definition of insanity is repeating the same thing over, and over, and over again, yet expecting a different outcome. PA has proven to most of you that they give zero fs about deconstructing their bias, and yet every review comments section is filled with the same exact faces. I see why they set it up this way....sound monetary strat. "Also the people ranting above are not even Huawei fanboys.". Did I say Huawei fanboys? I could've sworn I said fans. "You should take your Apple fanboyism down a couple of notches.". What? I asked them questions about their grading system. All I see here is a bunch of subjective drivel, including the comments section. I don't see what any of that has to do with my Apple fanboy or not status..

Maybe because you defend Apple at any given chance, and defend them with almost techie-long essays?. Don't get me wrong, I find you one of the most reasonable Apple fans here, but sometimes you just go too far as if you were a high-level iFan..

I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. Chinese tech powerhouse Huawei's got its sights set on the world. The P10 is its latest flagship product.. When I reviewed the Huawei P9 about a year ago, one of the things that caught my attention was how proud Huawei was of its Chinese roots, flaunting that the device was "Made in China" when. all other Chinese brands (and American brands, like Ivanka Trump's. clothing line or Apple) try to hide that fact. may be Shenzhen-based ZTE, which puts "Designed in USA" on the box of its Axon 7. why shouldn't Huawei be proud? It's a giant tech power that doesn't just make. smartphones and tablets, but telecommunication equipment to more than 170 countries.. The phones, of course, aren't too shabby either. The company's newest, the P10, continues the trend of really well-built handsets with strong Leica-branded cameras. The P9 was a pretty good phone, and the Mate 9 Pro was a really great phone (in my opinion the best smartphone of 2016). Can the P10 continue the trend?. The P10 feels at once like a continuation of the P9 brand while also making some drastic changes. Example: the dual-camera Leica set-up in the corner of the device under a black visor from the P9 returns for the P10, but the phone's fingerprint sensor has moved from the back to the front. The phone keeps the same cool brushed-metal back of the P9, but all the boxy/square-ish corners have been softened dramatically into an iPhone-like body in the P10. In all, the phone looks great, most likely because my review unit is in matte black, and I think that is, by far, the best color/texture on gadgets.. Phonemakers, please always offer a matte black variant of your phone. You want to experiment with all sorts of wacky colors, fine, but deep black is classic and timeless so always save a spot for that.. Huawei moving the fingerprint sensor to the iPhone/Samsung position of right underneath. the display is likely because the company is trying to promote a new way of navigation within the phone that's similar to what Meizu has done with its phones (I explained Meizu's "mBack" system here last year). In short, the P10's default navigation method does away with the traditional Android three button set-up (back, home, overview). Instead, the three actions are achieved by either long-pressing (home), tapping (back) or swiping (overview) on the fingerprint sensor. (Huawei actually first introduced this set-up on its Porsche design Mate 9,. but given that phone's crazy high price tag I doubt many people got to use it). The new Huawei navigation set-up is admirable -- I think Android's three button set-up is getting dated and something more streamlined should be considered -- but it's quite buggy right now. Plus with Huawei's set-up you won't be able to take advantage of some Android Nougat tricks like. That means you'll ultimately go back to the traditional Android three button set-up, which the P10 offers. But once you do that, you have the awkwardness of having a fingerprint sensor sitting where the home button is on most phones, except on the P10 it's not the home button, you still gotta tap on that circle on the display. I'd bet that Huawei will fix all this with the next phone (Mate 10?), as of now, it's a slight inconvenience.. With dimensions of 5.72 x 2.73 x 0.28 in and weighing just 145g, the P10 is a small phone.. That's about the only part of the P10 that's "below par." Everything about the P10 (in terms of performance) screams top-of-the-line. 960 is, in my opinion, the fastest chip on the market. I'm fortunately enough to get my hands on just about new phone, and the Kirin 960 beats the Snapdragon 821, Exynos 8890. I'm pretty sure the Snapdragon 835 on the Samsung Galaxy S8 won't match the Kirin 960 too. The dual Leica cameras also take some of the best photos of any smartphone I've ever seen. Huawei's consumer business group head Jim Xu told me the company spent a lot of time working with Leica to work on the software algorithm, and I believe him. Even though the P10's cameras get a spec bump (it's now 20- and 12-megapixel compared to the dual 12-megapixel on the P9), most of the improvement comes from just better software that's able to stitch together a superior photo. I already wrote an entire post showing the P10's photos during my trip to Italy, but below are more photo samples.. A shot from my hotel in Barcelona.. Check out the details in the sculptures.. Here is a 100% crop of the same shot.. Taken inside a dimly lit church in Florence. Check out how much details are in the 100% cropped parts.. Hail Caesar! (Cropped bits are 100% scale). Low light performance is also very strong.. As you can see, in general the photos capture a lot of details, with great saturation. Huawei's software has a myriad of filters and output modes (you can, for example, choose to have photos that come out punchier or more "realistic"), so there's a lot to play with. I suggest checking out my Mate 9 Pro or (standard) Mate 9. review for more information on these modes.. Of course, the selling point of the P10 is the Leica dual-lens set-up, which can take photos with a digital depth-of-field effect (aka the "bokeh" effect). Apple called this "portrait mode," and I guess the name stuck because I see quite a few other sites refer to "bokeh effect" as portrait mode now. Anyway, the P10 can still shoot photos in portrait mode with the rear cameras, of course, but Huawei and Leica's built a software algorithm into the single front-facing camera to pull off the same trick. I used the bokeh/portrait effect on my hand and my friend's dog. The best part about this mode is you can change the focus point post-shot. That means if I want, I can blur out my hand and have the photo highlight the MacBook behind my hand if I want.. On the left is another "bokeh effect" portrait mode; on the right is a photo shot with the P10's monochrome shooter.. So as you can see above, the "bokeh effect", aka portrait mode, can make certain photos look more dramatic. It's nothing game-changing, but a fun little effect to play with when you're taking photos of people and, uh, hands. As mentioned, you can also use this effect with the selfie camera, but the results are a mixed bag (or maybe it's just because I'm not photogenic ...).. The left is a selfie taken "normally," the right is with the "portrait mode" turned on. Other than some digitally blurred background, I don't see much difference. Also, I really, really hate taking selfies.. In all, the P10's camera is arguably the "best" mobile phone camera on the market, because it has the best combination of photo quality/detail when blown up, and also a bunch of fun modes. Black-and-white photos with the P10 (and the Mate 9) look absolutely fantastic.. The phone can shoot videos in. 4K and 1080p, up to 60 fps. OIS, however, works better in 1080p. You can also choose to use filters for videos.. The P10 (right) next to the Huawei Mate 9 Pro.. As a media playing device, the P10 is a mixed bag. The 5.1-inch LCD panel is bright and vibrant, but it's still only 5.1-inches (tiny by today's standards) and not AMOLED. single bottom-firing speaker is solid but pales in comparison to stereo speakers on the ZTE Axon 7 or even the Huawei Mate 9 Pro. The P10 isn't a phone you'd want to watch movies with anyway, since it's so small (you can get the Huawei P10 Plus or the LG G6 for that).. On the software front, not much has changed since the Huawei Mate 9 Pro. The phone runs Android 7.0 with Huawei's EMUI on top, and as I've written before: EMUI is not bad! It's cleaned up a lot. In fact, I love the dark notification/quick toggle shade. The phone ships with no app drawer out of the box, but Huawei lets you set one up. I ended up just slapping Nova launcher on all my phones anyway.. The 3,200 mAh battery inside is enough to last you a full day. That's to be expected, since the phone has a small(ish) display, only 1080p resolution, and being a Chinese phone, has some aggressive software optimization built-in. It's pretty hard to run out of battery when you're using a Chinese phone released after 2015.. Like all of Huawei's recent devices, the P10 ships with a very high quality case that's made of hard plastic.. So we know the phone has great build quality and battery life, is super smooth/fast, and has a fun, high-quality camera. So what's not to like about the P10? Well, a couple of things.. I can handle that for a budget OnePlus or Meizu device, but Huawei markets and sells their phones at a tier closer to Samsung and Apple flagships. Second, as sexy as the P10 looks, those bezels top and bottom will be considered large when placed next to the LG G6 or the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8.. 2017 is the year of slim bezels, and the P10 has sadly missed the boat on this. And slim bezels matter! It's not just for looks. Slim bezels means a phone can have a large display while keeping body compact. For example, the LG G6 has a display that's half an inch larger than the P10, yet the G6 is only a bit larger, because it has really slim bezels.. I'm sure the Mate 9 will catch up to the trend and drastically trim the forehead and chin of the device. But as of now, the P10 has a slightly dated design. Still, it's not the end of the world -- this phone is still worth getting if you travel a lot and don't want to lug around a full sized camera. Trust me on this -- I went to Florence, Milan and Rome for a week and the P10 captured so many great shots, friends kept asking me what camera I was using.. Here's a parting shot from the Spanish steps in Rome, taken with the P10 using its "night mode.". This photo, to put it bluntly, simply couldn't have been possible on most other phones on the market. Because it was during the evening and the streets were already dark, photos with other phones would have to either focus on the skies and leave the streets dark, or focus on the streets and overexpose the skies. The P10, using "night mode," was able to capture lighting in an even manner..

Huawei P10 lite review A good mid-range option for those on a budget. by Gary Sims April 22, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. EMUI now let's you add an app drawer. The Huawei P10 lite certainly ticks a lot of the right boxes for a mid-range device. It's thin, has a good sized battery, and offers reasonable performance, all on a budget.. Processor Kirin 658, 16nm Octa-core (4 Ã 2.1GHz + 4 x 1.7GHz) + i5 co-processor. RAM 3GB RAM / 4GB RAM (WEU, Northern Africa, Southeast Asia, APAC only). Cameras Rear: 12MP, 1/2.8 inch sensor and 1.25 Âµm single pixel. 802.11 ac/a/b/g/n, 2.4 GHz / 5 GHz (WEU, Japan, Korea). NFC Yes (only two models only - WAS-LX1A, WAS-LX1). Colors Graphite Black/Sapphire Blue/Pearl White/Platinum Gold. Dimensions and weight 146.5 x 72 x 7.2 mm. The Huawei P10 lite certainly ticks a lot of the right boxes for a mid-range device. It’s thin, has a good sized battery, and offers reasonable performance, all on a budget. Also the ability to enable an app drawer should help EMUI find greater acceptance. The software offers some good extra features and having 4 GB of RAM is nice. While it doesn’t have a dual camera setup, the included camera is certainly usable especially in good lighting.. Recently Huawei launched this year’s “P” model, the high-end P10 with its Leica-branded dual cameras and a sleek metal design. However, as a high-end phone it will be outside the budget of some consumers. Therefore Huawei has also launched a cheaper version of the P10 called the P10 lite. It doesn’t come with the P10’s dual cameras nor does it have the same flagship level internals, but similarly neither does it carry the same price tag!. I got the device a few days ago and I have been trying it out. So here is my in-depth review of the Huawei P10 lite.. Although the P10 lite uses the same name as its bigger siblings, the P10 and P10 Plus, it doesn’t really use the same design language. There are several significant differences including no physical home button, no dual-cameras, and noÂ. However what you do get is a metal frame, chamfered edges, and a fingerprint reader on the back.Â. On the front you get aÂ. 5.2-inch display along with a discrete Huawei logo. As mentioned, there is no physical home button andÂ. the P10 lite uses on-screen navigation keys.. Going around the rest of the phone, the volume rocker and textured power button are on the right, while the SIM trayÂ. At the bottom you will find the speaker grill and the micro USB port for charging the 3,000 mAh battery. On the back is the rear facing camera along with the flash and the fingerprint reader.. According to my testing the display is capable of 445 nits of brightness and according to the specs it has a contrast ratio of 1500:1. 1,920Ã1,080 resolution yields a very decent 423 pixels per inch.. The display is plenty bright enough for indoors and it is still usable outdoors, however at only 445 nits it could struggle in very bright direct sunlight.Â. You can change the color temperature of the display in the Settings menu to be a little warmer or cooler to better suit your tastes, but for me the default settings were good enough.. Overall the display is crisp and vibrant and certainly a plus point in this “lite” version of the P10.. The Huawei P10 lite features an in-house Kirin 658Â. It is a slightly beefed up version of the Kirin 650 found in the Huawei P9 lite. It has an octa-core CPU configuration with four Cortex-A53 cores, clocked at 2.36 GHz and another four clocked at 1.7 GHz. The chip also features a Mali-T830 MP2 GPU.. There are two variations of the device, depending on the particular model and region. Thereâs a 32 GB version with 3 GB of RAM and another 32 GB version with 4 GB of RAM. It seems that Western Europe, Northern Africa, Southeast Asia, and APAC get the 4 GB version, while the rest of the world gets the 3 GB version.. Most of the models have dual-SIM support with the second SIM supporting 2G only, however there is one model that takes just a single SIM. Regardless, all models have a microSD card slot.. Although the Cortex-A53 is designed more for power efficiency than peak performance, the P10 lite still feelsÂ. smooth, apps open and close quickly, and with 4 GB of RAM multi-tasking is a breeze.. 2D games work well on this device and it can also manage 3D games, however the GPU will be under powered for those looking to play complex 3D games at high frame rates.. In terms of the benchmarks, the Huawei P10 liteÂ. on Geekbench’s single-core test and 3310Â. That is on par (if not slightly better) than other octa-core Cortex-A53 based processors like the Snapdragon 625, which you find in phones like theÂ. Huawei Nova and the Moto G5 Plus .. For AnTuTu, the P10 lite scored 61164, which places it in the company of older phones like the LG V10 , the Nexus 5X and the Samsung Galaxy S4. A flagship P10 gets over 132,000 for AnTuTu, so you can reckon that the P10 lite has about half the performance of today’s leading high-end devices or the same performance as a flagship device from 2 years ago.. Epic Citadel, the device manages 46.6 frames per second in Ultra High Quality mode, which is actually higher than I was expecting considering the GPU in the Kirin 658 only has two shader cores.. The fingerprint reader on the P10 lite is very good. To be honest I have come to expect nothing less from Huawei. The fingerprint reader on the P10 is excellent and the P10 lite has followed suit. fingerprint reader is on the back, you can wake and unlock your phone just by putting your finger on the reader. You can also use the fingerprint reader to trigger the shutter while taking photos, as well as use it to swipe left and right when viewing photos in the gallery, or to answer a call.. The Huawei P10 lite features a single speaker on the bottom edge, next to the micro USB port. The speaker is quite loud and the sound is reasonable considering it isn’t a front facing speaker. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was very little distortion at full volume, something I frequently hear on other mid-range phones.. The P10 lite has a 3,000Â. mAh non-removable battery, which is a great plus point when you consider how sleek Huawei have made this device. I ran Epic Citadel to test the battery life while playing 3D games. According to my calculations you will be able to play 3D games for around 4 hours from a full charge. As for simpler tasks like browsing or watching video you will get at least 8 hours.. Overall you will be able to get through a full day without needing to reach for the charger. You should get between 5 and 6 hours of screen-on time during a 24 hour period for mixed activities like 3D gaming, web browsing and taking photos.. charging, the P10 lite supports quick charging and the supplied charger is a rated as high as 18W ( 9V/2A). To go from 10% to 100% takes 87 minutes with the final 22 minutes accounting for the last 10% (from 90% to 100%). To get to 50% from 10% takes around half an hour.. The Huawei P10 lite runs Android 7.0 out of the box, complete with Huaweiâs Emotion UI Â. The biggest gripe that people seem to have with EMUI is the lack of an app drawer, however that should no longer be an issue as Huawei has included the ability to change the home screen to include an app drawer!. For those of you unfamiliar with EMUI, the general look-and-feel is different to stock Android with Huawei’s own launcherÂ. However besides the UI changes there are lots of additional features that you don’t get with stock Android includingÂ. motion gestures, a floating dock, voice control,Â. one-handed mode and Huawei’s own take on the “do not disturb” mode.. Under motion gestures you can enable motions like “flip to mute” and “raise to ear” to answer calls. There is also the familiar Knuckle gestures which allow you to take a screenshot by double tapping the screen with your knuckle, or drawing a letter to open an app. Both types of knuckle gesture can be disabled if you find they misfire.. Since the P10 lite uses on-screen keys, Huawei has added the ability to customize the order of the navigation buttons. By default the back button is on the left and the recent apps is on the right. However this can be reversed to Samsung’s (old) way of doing things if you prefer. It is also possible to add a fourth button for opening the notification panel. Tapping the icon is the equivalent to dragging the notification shade down from the top.. Huawei has included a basic battery manager which can detect power-intensive apps as well as optimize the phone’s settings for better battery life (screen brightness etc). There is also a power saving mode which limits background app activity and reduces some of the visual effects. Plus there is an ultra power saving mode which gives you access to a basic launcher and just a few essential apps like phone and messaging.. You get a 12 MP rear camera with a 1.25 micron pixel size on a 1/1.28 inch sensor. While Huawei claims things like “20 percent more light” the truth is that a 1/1.28 inch sensor is tiny, even by smartphone standards. Having said that, I am impressed with the photos this device can take, especially those in good day light conditions. As expected, the camera struggles in lower lighting, but not as badly as I had feared. The images can be grainy and colors often appear more muted than in better lit conditions.. Apart from the more standard modes like HDR and Panorama there are lots of camera modes available includingÂ. a full manual mode, which offers greater control over ISO, exposure and shutter speed. Other modes include time-lapse, slow-mo, and watermark. a light painting mode, that lets you capture light trails created by things like moving cars, or the stars in the sky. The effect can be really cool, but does require very steady hands, or a tripod mount, to get the shot to look the way you’ll want it.. The 8 MP front-facing camera is also solid enough, and should make selfie junkiesÂ. You will find a standard beautification mode available, plus the Perfect Selfie mode, which allows you to tinker with your selfie portraits with options to enlarge your eyes and thin your face!. My biggest complaint I have had with previous Huawei devices is that theÂ. camera app didn’t rotate all the UI elements when you move from portrait to landscape. The good news is that this has been (mainly) fixed with the P10 lite (and also with the P10).. Since this is a budget-friendly phone there is noÂ. Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) or 4K video.. to help you judge the camera for yourself:. Overall I would say if you are looking for a phone on a budget then it is certainly worth considering the Huawei P10 Lite.. Your source for all things Android!.

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. significant progress in presenting a strong challenge to the dominance of Samsung within the Android market, and in providing potential customers an alternative to the usual suspects, with the key being a slightly lower price point.. The latest flagship Android device from the company is the Huawei P10 , a more refined version of its predecessor that sees the return of the Leica-branded dual-camera setup on the rear of the handset and the shift of the fingerprint sensor from the rear to the front.. Does the Huawei P10 offer enough to stand up against strong competition from the likes of LG, Samsung, Sony and other household names?. Design As a flagship device, it's no surprise to see the P10 sporting an all metal and glass chassis and a focus on super-slim design, both traits the Huawei P9 shared too. Indeed, simply glance at the two phones side-by-side and there's a chance you wouldn't really tell them apart, unless you were specifically looking for the more rounded corners of the P10.. Along the right side of the handset, there's a single volume rocker and power switch, while the two-in-one dual-SIM and microSD slot sits on the left side. Flip the phone over and you'll find the Leica 2 dual-sensor camera setup, and that Huawei has relocated the fingerprint sensor from the rear of the phone into the home screen button. Whether or not this is your preference is a different question, but it does happen to be mine. Some people do find it more useful, and easier to reach, on the rear of the device though, even though it runs the risk of smudging the camera lens with a greasy fingerprint.. Above that fingerprint sensor is a 5.1in full HD (1080p) display, single speaker, and forward-facing 8MPsnapper for selfies and video calling.. While the P10 doesn't offer the curved edges of Samsung's premium Galaxy range, nor quite bezel-less design, the overall size of the phone, particularly being just 6.98mm thick, is no mean feat.. Officially, it measures up at 145.3mm x 69.3mm x 6.98mm and weighs 145 grams, which makes it thinner and lighter than all of its main competitors from the crop of new 2017 smartphones, including the S8, LG G6 , and Sony Xperia XZ. It does have a smaller screen than some of those, however, which is worth keeping in mind if size is critical to you.. For most people, an extra millimeter here or gram there isn't going to be the make-or-break factor, however, so the pursuit of the ‘thinnest' phone title isn't necessarily one worth winning for Huawei.. Coming from a slightly larger everyday phone, the 5.1in panel, combined with the slimness, gave the impression that it's closer to using what would have been a 4.7in (iPhone-size) device of the past.. It is, however, hard to ignore that it feels a little like a direct aim at producing an iPhone competitor - an iPhone for people that want to use Android, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.. Display, hardware and storage The exact specification of the Huawei P10 varies a little depending on your location, but for the UK, it ships with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage, though this can be expanded using the microSD in the multi-function SIM slot. Other regions get between 32GB and 128GB of storage on board.. Drawing the most attention is the 5.1in Full HD display (1,920 x 1,080 pixels, 432 PPI), which, despite not matching up to the Quad HD resolutions of some competitors, has a bright, vibrant image that can more than live up to the UK's dazzlingly bright (!) sunshine.. If you opt for the larger P10 Plus, you do get a step up in resolution to 1440p, but it's one that you'd appreciate more on the larger 5.5in display. Practically, where the Huawei falls short on paper, you're unlikely to notice in your everyday usage, even if that frequently includes using your phone for TV and movies.. The upside of this decision for the P10 is a lower power draw from the display compared to a larger or higher-resolution panel, and given most people's battery life frustrations, the difference in visual quality is probably worthwhile. Give the screen size, the 3,200mAh battery is a solid choice, but more on that later.. Powering everything along is a Kirin 960 Octa-Core chipset, which is a pairing of quad Cortex A73 (2.4GHz) and quad Cortex A53 (1.8GHz) processors. The review model (VTR-L09) reviewed here had 4GB of RAM.. Support for 4G bands is similarly dependent on where you buy your phone, but assuming it comes from a regular UK retailer or network, there's support for 4G on one of the SIM slots, while the other is limited to 3G, and is primarily for calling.. As a sidenote, Huawei, is one of the few smartphone vendors shipping phones with support for the multi-constellation satellite setup on offer today, meaning it connects to GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and BeiDou (BDS).. Naturally, for a top-of-the-range smartphone, there's the usual accoutrements you'd expect to find nowadays too, such as Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC..

Software Price and competition Daily usage experiences and conclusion. Big phones fit well in my hand and I don't mind using phones measuring 6 inches or less. However, I also love sliding a 5.1 inch phone into my front jeans or shorts pocket and feeling it disappear. The Huawei P10 will not appear directly in the US, but I've been using one for the past couple of weeks and might even give up the Mate 9 for the P10.. Huawei Mate 9 review: Meet the new best Android smartphone for business users (RIP, Note 7). At a whopping 5.9 inches, Huawei's latest combines the big screen and big battery of the Mate 8 with the fantastic dual-lens Leica camera of the P9. At just $599.99, it is a compelling offering priced much lower than models released outside the US.. One compelling feature of the affordable Mate 9 that cannot be matched by the P10 is the whopping 4,000 mAh battery. The Huawei P10 does have a 3,200 mAh battery, which is larger than the massive HTC U Ultra and even bigger than the new Samsung Galaxy S8 so it is no slouch.. CNET: Huawei's new P10 phones: Dual Leica cameras, 3D face detection and plenty of Pantone. Huawei sent me the Dazzling Blue model to check out and it is stunning. Blue is my favorite color and the blue on the Huawei P10 is an interesting shade that looks good in the office and out on the town. The other colors are also unique and with limits on how far smartphones can be distinguished, Huawei is doing all it can do to make these stand out from the crowd of black slabs.. As you can see, these are nearly the same specifications as the Huawei Mate 9 with the exception of a smaller display and smaller battery. The Mate 9 is a rather large device so it's a wonderful option to have the same powerful phone in a much smaller form factor and it has been a true joy to carry around the Huawei P10 for the last couple of weeks.. The Huawei P10 has a front glass panel constructed of Gorilla Glass 5 while the Mate 9 uses Gorilla Glass 3. Gorilla Glass 5 adds an element of drop protection to your phone and is what you should be looking for in a 2017 phone. The Samsung Galaxy S8/S8 Plus and HTC U Ultra also use Gorilla Glass 5.. The Huawei P10 comes with a screen protector applied out of the box and the manual recommends that you leave it installed, which I did. I read reports on some Android sites that stated the bare display has limited oleophobic coating so may be tougher to remove fingerprints. The screen protector was fine and I just slid the P10 up and down my pants or shirt to wipe it clear a couple times a day.. The Huawei P10 is the world's first smartphone with a capacitive under-glass fingerprint sensor for seamless navigation. Similar to the recent Moto G5 Plus I tested, you can use this new fingerprint sensor as a single navigation key and skip using the on screen navigation bar. Tap to go back, touch and hold to go home, swipe left or right across the navigation key to view recent tasks, and swipe up from the edge of the screen to launch Google Assistant.. The Dazzling Blue color is present on the rounded edges and on the back panel and it looks awesome. The dual cameras, flash, and sensor are found at the very top of the back while the majority of the back panel is composed of a textured metal finish. If you run your fingernail across the back, it sounds like you are running it along a record. Fingerprints are less obvious and there is a bit of grip provided by the textured back. I've never seen anything like it on a smartphone before and it gives the Huawei P10 a bit of a unique look and feel.. You will find a 3.5mm headphone jack, USB Type-C port, and mono speaker on the bottom. The microSD card and SIM card slot are on the upper left while the power and volume buttons are on the upper right. The power button has some texture to it and on the blue model you can see red highlights around the sides of the button. A single mic opening is found on the top.. The Kirin 960 processor means that the Huawei P10 flies and I never saw any lag in performance while testing it out. The P10 battery is quite large for a device of this size, the Google Pixel only has a 2,770 mAh battery, and I was able to go a full day every day I used it.. 1 - 5 of 18. The Huawei P10 launches with Android 7.0 Nougat and EMUI 5.1. After seeing Nougat on Samsung Galaxy and LG G6 devices, I personally prefer the EMUI look and feel. The top black quick controls is much better than the bright white found on Nougat devices and that area is kind of a pet peeve for me.. There are a few Huawei utilities installed by default, including an email app, file manager, flashlight, Huawei Health, HiCare, music app, messaging app, notepad, gallery app, phone manager, voice recorder, theme manager, video player, and weather app. You cannot uninstall these apps, but I just put them in a folder and ignore them.. Similar to iOS, one function I particularly enjoy on EMUI 5.1 is the swipe down to then quickly find apps, contacts, and messages. It improves my efficiency and productivity so that is why I don't install a third party launcher.. You can also enable knuckle gestures, powered by Qeexo FingerSense , and once you get used to making the gestures you may find yourself using them more and more. You can choose to launc up to four different apps with the letter c, e, m, and w. You can also slide your knuckle across the display to enter split screen mode. Give it a try and you may find it to improve your productivity.. Whenever I use one of these Huawei dual camera smartphones, I end up taking more photos more often than with any other phone. As I mentioned when I checked out the Huawei P9 the camera software is powerful and helps you be creative with your shooting. There are a plethora of available modes; auto, monochrome, video, HDR, panorama, night shot, light painting, time-lapse, slow motion, document scan, and more. You can also swipe up to switch to full manual mode and shoot exactly what you want.. The wide aperture mode is there with a simple tap on the proper icon and this allows you to capture photos with different focal points applied after the shot. There is a new portrait mode, thank you Apple, that helps you capture fun photos of people with the background blurred. For even more fun, the Huawei P10 includes a portrait toggle on the 8 megapixel front facing camera, also branded by Leica. The portrait software on the front-facing camera may yield funky results though. Check out my image gallery for a few samples. I also have some comparison shots in this Flickr gallery with the Moto G5 Plus and in this Flickr gallery so you can compare the original images for yourself.. The Huawei P10 standard price is EUR 649. By comparison, the Huawei Mate 9 is EUR 699 so you save EUR 50 going with a smaller device.. There are not many small smartphones being sold today, but the closest in size is last year's Samsung Galaxy S7 that also has a 5.1 inch display and the Apple iPhone 7 with a 4.7 inch display.. I fell in love again with a small phone while using the Huawei P10 and it sure helped that the color and design is fantastic. It took a couple of days to adapt, but I like using the single home button to navigate all of the options without using the on-screen navigation buttons traditionally seen on Android devices.. The camera is a blast and if a phone encourages you to capture a bit more of the world around you then that's exciting. These small Huawei devices help me be more creative and I enjoy photography more when I am having fun.. When you look at the Huawei P9 from last year, we see the fingerprint scanner move from the rear to the lower front, more rounded corners on the P10, the display downsized from 5.2 to 5.1 inches, Gorilla Glass 3 to Gorilla Glass 5, a new processor, a more powerful monochrome sensor, and an upgrade in battery capacity by 200 mAh. Overall, I find the Huawei P10 to be a very nice upgrade to the P9.. I understand the Huawei P10 has an IPx2 rating, which means it may be good for a slight splash or light rain. I would love to go running with a device like this due to its size and if I did then I would pack it in a Ziploc bag or waterproof case.. The Huawei P10 is great for those looking for a very capable and powerful smartphone in a smaller package. There is definitely a focus on the camera experience too. The P10 looks great and US customers can buy the P10 through online retailers such as Amazon as a GSM unlocked device for about $800.. Huawei also released the slightly larger Huawei P10 Plus that will be reviewed here on ZDNet soon. I see this device can be purchased on Amazon for about $820..

Huawei P10 Lite review: While the Huawei P10 features a metal body, Leica-branded dual cameras and a fingerprint sensor-laden home button, the much cheaper £299 Huawei P10 Lite has none of these traits. simply hoping to ride the coattails of the company’s flagship phone, or is it a worthwhile mid-range mobile?. Huawei’s big 2017 flagship phone, the Huawei P10 , is a solid premium handset, yet far too expensive for what you get. As you’ll see in our recent P10 re-review , it’s barely dipped in price since its February launch and yet offers no standout features compared with premium rivals.. Despite this, we still love Huawei’s design ethos and smart software, which is why we were so hungry to try out the Huawei P10 Lite. This mid-range phone is almost half the price of the original P10, yet still offers the same Emotion UI and some respectable specs. That said, the P10 Lite also changes up Huawei’s aesthetics and scales back to a single lens camera, compared with the flagship’s dual-lens snapper.. Have a look at our P10 Lite vs P10 vs P10 Plus comparison to see how Huawei’s family stack up against each other.. The P10 Lite faces strong competition in the mid-range stakes from the likes of the Moto G5 Plus and the Honor 9 ,. So can Huawei’s affordable phone stand up against its rivals? Here’s our full review.. Check out our round-up of the best Huawei phones for more of the company’s smartest handsets.. Rather than taking cues from the P10 and P10 Plus , aesthetically the P10 Lite looks like a subtle evolution of its predecessor, the P9 Lite. You get a glass front and back with nicely rounded edges, a squared sturdy metal frame broken up by a few antenna lines and a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor.. Like the company’s other phones, picking the right colour is the key to minimising the visibility of smudges and fingerprints, which are inevitable where glass-bodied handsets are concerned. We appreciate the tactile, textured hardware controls too but were hoping for the convenience and future-proofing that USB-C affords, rather than the now ageing microUSB standard that the P10 Lite sports.. You may have assumed that this stripped-back P-Series phone would be smaller than its flagship counterpart but in truth, the P10 Lite is actually fractionally larger in all directions, heavier and packs a bigger 5.2-inch display in as well.. It’s arguably one of the nicest aspects of the Lite, with impressive contrast, especially from a mid-ranger with an LTPS LCD. Its Full HD resolution renders text and imagery cleanly and it prioritises accuracy over vibrancy with regards to colour. The phone also possesses an Eye Comfort mode, which can be activated manually or scheduled to shift the colour temperature of the display into a warmer gamut for more comfortable viewing in low light environments or late at night.. As for the audio experience, there’s a single downward-facing speaker behind a grille on the phone’s bottom edge that pushes out clear but uneventful sound, and despite thinning down from its predecessor you can also expect a conventional 3.5mm headphone jack in there too.. Like the beefier P10s and Honor ’s most recent efforts, the P10 Lite sports the latest iteration of the company’s Android overlay out the box: Emotion UI 5.1 , running atop Android 7.0 Nougat.. We’ve already waxed lyrical about the huge improvement 5.1 is over older iterations of Huawei’s user experience but in practice, its talents fall into three key areas. Firstly, the company has tidied up the interface, with a simpler, easier to understand notifications pane and settings menu, along with the option to include an apps drawer and the presence of a global search bar, so you can locate an app, contact or message in seconds.. Secondly, customisation is as ever a fundamental part of this Huawei’s user experience. The Themes app lets you quickly swap out the wallpapers and app icons on display (although most of the default options are a little over-designed for our tastes) along with the. ability to alter the transition animations between homescreens and other launcher behaviour like notifications badges.. Read next: Huawei P10 Lite Tips & Tricks. The third piece of the P10 Lite’s EMUI puzzle is the software’s talents concerning background optimisation. Huawei Ultra Memory & Ultra Response are two intelligent technologies that help ensure that the P10 Lite feels fast in everyday use and stays snappy over the course of its normal lifetime.. Ultra Memory does the equivalent of defragmenting on the regular to keep file systems neat and tidy paired with predictive memory allocation and compression that’s influenced by your usage, so the apps you use most often benefit from the most resources, whilst seldom-used programs don’t hog compute power of memory unnecessarily.. As for Ultra Response, EMUI also tries or predict where you’re going to tap and swipe within the phone’s interface so that those actions feel just that little bit snappier. Neither feature is unique to the P10 Lite but we’re glad they’re there.. This is the first phone we’ve encountered sporting the company’s own Kirin 658 and on paper, it’s. comparable to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 625 – the chipset powering last year’s Huawei Nova and Nova Plus. It packs plenty of punch for everyday use and paired with 4GB of RAM on the P10 Lite, seem more than comfortable sporting split-screen multitasking and running 3D games.. As for storage, the UK version packs 32GB in internally but almost 10GB of that is occupied by the phone’s firmware. That said, the remaining 23GB should satiate most users need for apps and local media and if not there’s microSD support by up to a further 256GB.. There’s also a 3000mAh non-removable battery inside the P10 Lite and it’s another gem. You can expect just shy of two days of mixed usage per charge thanks in part to the company’s Smart Power-Saving 5.0 tech and Huawei’s 18W Quick Charger is on board too, so you can juice back up for another day’s worth of use in minutes rather than hours. 43 percent charge and 97 minutes charge time for a full charge; in our real-world tests it took. A set of Leica-branded dual rear cameras are one of the defining aspects of the P10 and P10 Plus but sadly Huawei didn’t transpose this signature hardware when selecting the snappers on the Lite. The phone instead uses a single 12-megapixel primary camera with an f/ 2.2 aperture and a single LED flash on the back, while an 8-megapixel sensor with an f/ 2.0 aperture sits on the front.. The interface is feature-packed but also clean, with nearly all of the functionality you’d want. spread across three screens: a mode switcher, the viewfinder and a settings screen. The Lite also packs some functionality seldom-seen outside of Huawei’s wheelhouse, including pro video, watermark and light painting modes.. As for picture quality, shots typically turn out well-exposed with an accurate colouring and a pleasingly wide-dynamic range when shooting in higher-contrast situations. Low light shots also come with a surprisingly low amount of grain and noise whilst more exotic modes like Light Painting work better than expected too. Image stability, or rather a lack thereof, is the main camera’s biggest shortcoming, meaning low light shots aren’t as crisp as we’d like and video recording (which tops out at 1080p at 30fps) retains even slight shakes or judders when shooting handheld. HDR mode doesn’t appear to make much of a difference to still either.. Our Huawei P10 Lite camera review will give you a full rundown of the phone’s photographic talents and quirks.. If it isn’t already apparent the Huawei P10 Lite is clearly more of a refinement upon the P9 Lite, than a stripped down version of the company’s P10 flagship, which is a bit of a shame.. It lacks the standout features of Huawei’s current top dog and as such, feels like just another premium mid-ranger. That said, a dated design doesn’t detract from its capabilities.. The P10 Lite is well built, offers a great user experience and performs well. Its camera is reliable but needs work in some key areas to be truly great and the £299 price tag places it within firing range of the excellent Moto G5 Plus ; a bigger, bulkier phone for sure, but one that can take on and even surpass the P10 Lite in some areas, for less..

Huawei P10 Review: After a week of using the Huawei P10 flagship phone as my full-time smartphone, I’m more than impressed with Huawei’s enticing blend of attractive design, solid specs and fully-functional software. Here’s our full Huawei P10 review.. Huawei launched its new P10 flagship phone out at MWC 2017 , along with a super-size P10 Plus model boasting even stronger specs and increased dimensions. The standard Huawei P10 phone still shines however, with plenty of. into a pleasingly compact 5.1-inch form.. The P10 not only boasts Huawei’s smartly designed dual-lens Leica 2 camera, which is absolutely stuffed with funky camera and video modes. You also get Huawei’s latest Kirin 960 processor, some eye-catching new design choices and the brilliant Emotion UI user experience. So, is the P10 already one of the best smartphones to buy in 2017?. Here’s everything you need to know about the Huawei P10 in our full review.. Read next: Huawei P10 vs P9, should I upgrade to the 2017 model?. Huawei hasn’t exactly thrown out its smartphone template when it comes to the Huawei P10’s design, at least in the standard sandblasted model.. This 5.1-inch handset looks pretty similar to the P9 flagship from last year, but with more rounded corners and edges for a more comfortable fit in the palm. You still get that glossy bar up top where the dual-lens camera resides, while button and port positioning is the same. The Type-C USB port and headphone jack are down below, with a drawer for your microSD memory card and SIM card housed on the left edge.. One-handed use is a doddle, in part thanks to the compact and curved finish and in part thanks to Huawei’s one-handed mode which shrinks the screen with a quick swipe. We love the slender finish too, with those almost non-existent bezels left and right of the P10’s display.. You can grab the Huawei P10 in one of two alternative finishes, if the brushed metal model doesn’t float your boat. The new ‘dazzling’ model features a precision-cut textured back that certainly stands out, while a glossy ceramic version is both hardy and a serious break from the standard metal design. You also get a strong selection of colours in the sandblasted and dazzling models, including the very attractive and rather vibrant new green hue.. The P10 isn’t water resistant, but it can survive a serious splashing in a rainstorm. You can always rely on British weather to help out with that little bit of testing. So far, after over a week of full-time use, it seems pretty hardy too. That metal surfacing shows no sign of scratching or other wear.. Huawei knows how to throw together a great smartphone screen and the P10’s 5.1-inch IPS LCD panel is once again a winner.. The P10’s vibrant built-in themes help to show off the strong colour range, with striking visuals on par with the likes of Sony’s Xperia XZ and the OnePlus 3T. Brightness levels are competent enough to cut through pesky glare when outdoors, while viewing angles are perfectly wide.. That Full HD resolution might not be as supremely crisp as the Quad HD and even 4K output of some of the P10’s rivals launched out at MWC 2017. But it doesn’t matter, because the relatively compact 5.1-inch screen still pumps out sharp, clear images. High-def movies certainly look wonderful, although true film buffs who travel a lot might look to the LG G6 with its Dolby Vision support , or the Ultra HD screen of the Sony Xperia XZ Premium which also supports HDR playback.. You get a generous 64GB of storage space, which can be expanded via microSD if you have an enormous media collection.. The Huawei P10 runs Android Nougat , the latest version of Google’s mobile OS, which gives you loads of great features including the ability to split-screen multitask with two apps at once. You also get plenty of personalisation options, as well as resource management tools to help out when the battery’s low or the phone shows signs of ageing.. Huawei has added its own software on top of Android, known as Emotion UI (or EMUI for short). Recent Huawei phones such as the Mate 9 and Honor 8 came packing the fresh new EMUI 5.0 , but the P10 updates this to EMUI 5.1.. Check out our in-depth review of EMUI 5 to read more about Huawei’s excellent mobile software, and our EMUI 5.1 what’s new review to see what additional features and tweaks have been made for the P10. However, in a nutshell, Huawei’s additions help to strengthen an already solid user experience. You get a useful one-handed mode, some vibrant themes that match the colourful hardware, plenty of gesture shortcuts to save time and more besides.. That fingerprint sensor improves the phone’s security and is impressively responsive, with almost one hundred percent accuracy to boot. However, it’s a shame the scanner has been moved to below the screen as it isn’t quite as accessible as the old rear-mounted sensors. That said, we like how it now functions as a home, back and recent apps button all rolled into one. Just tap for back, press for home and swipe for recent apps. It’s a method that takes a little getting used to, but works beautifully once you’ve adapted.. Read next: Huawei P10 tips, tricks and best hidden features. Packed inside the P10 is a Kirin 960 chipset, the same internals found in the rather beefy Huawei Mate 9. Backed by 4GB of RAM, you know you’ll get silky smooth performance no matter what you’re up to. Blasting the latest Google Play games, the P10 doesn’t even begin to sweat. While multi-tasking with two apps at once is just as ably handled.. For any benchmark enthusiasts out there, the P10 scored 144847 in our AnTuTu benchmarking tests. That beats the majority of other Android phones out there, with the exception of powerhouses like the OnePlus 3T .. The P10 also packs a meaty 3200mAh battery, and I found that I could make it through a full day of pretty heavy use on a single charge. However, the phone does lose charge faster than expected. Diving into the power settings, I found that simply being on standby sapped a large amount of the P10’s battery power. That’s with very little time spent searching for networks, too. At least you get some handy battery optimisation tools, which can close power-draining apps when the phone is idle. That’s alongside the usual battery saver modes and so on.. So at least if you’re in a bind, you shouldn’t struggle to save the power dregs for when they’ll really count.. Huawei’s fast charging feature is also pretty impressive stuff, allowing you to get a 50 percent charge in roughly half an hour. Good news if you wake up and realise your P10’s not plugged in and ready to die.. Like the Huawei P9 before it, the Huawei P10 boasts a dual-lens rear camera designed in collaboration with partners Leica. This updated mobile snapper offers a 20-megapixel monochrome lens and a 12-megapixel colour lens, complete with Optical Image Stabilisation (on the colour lens at least), PDAF and a two-tone LED flash.. If you want to know what all of that gubbins means, take a close look at the P10’s camera and video modes and browse some photo and video samples shot on the P10, we have you covered. Just check out our in-depth Huawei P10 camera review for our full testing and. analysis of the Leica 2 shooter.. The Huawei P10 is a solid all-round smartphone, offering smart hardware that’s elevated by some well-designed software. If you’re after a particular feature or looking to tweak some part of the user experience, chances are the P10 will allow you to do it.. Of course, there’s no massive leap here compared with earlier handsets such as the Huawei P9 or Mate 9. No killer feature which absolutely demands an upgrade from one of Huawei’s 2016 mobiles. So while I’d happily rock the Huawei P10 as my full-time phone for the rest of 2017 and beyond, it’s difficult to recommend an upgrade if your chosen blower still does the job.. We’re yet to test the P10 Plus, but that handset certainly seems to offer a more fulfilling flagship experience compared with the P10. You get an improved screen, better camera tech, a bigger battery and even faster performance, so we reckon that might be the one to look for if you’re considering an upgrade.
