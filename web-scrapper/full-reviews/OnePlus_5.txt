I recently upgrade from the OnePlus 2 to the 5. By Abigail Moore | 2 Dec 2017. After spending two years frustrated with my Samsung phone, I decided to ditch all the main brands and go with something a little off the radar. Found an article talking about non-flagship phones and the OnePlus brand was listed. Took a chance on the OnePlus 2 and was 110% pleased with the results. When it came time to wanting an upgrade, I didn't even bother looking at other phones. I went straight to the OnePlus website and bought a OnePlus 5. I almost never take pictures but when I do it is far superior to the phones I have had in the past - and that is really all I need. If I wanted to take amazing "better than life" pictures, I would buy a camera dedicated to that. But I'm not a photographer, so I'm not picky.. The RAM and memory available at the price I bought it for, unlocked, is hands down the best on the market imo.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. By Hadi Mushtaq Dar | 23 Nov 2017. is fingerprint sensor includes in all sensors?. Was this review helpful? Yes No. By Michał Jawor | 13 Nov 2017. I do not understand why he got only 7 points for design ?. It is very well designed, as evidenced by a very thin case, a fingerprint reader on the front and dont overheat..

The OnePlus 5 (also abbreviated as OP5 ) is a smartphone made by OnePlus. It is the successor to the OnePlus 3T released in 2016. The OnePlus 5 was officially unveiled during a keynote on 20 June 2017. The Verge announced in May 2017 that the upcoming device would be known as the OnePlus 5. It was said that this decision was due to the number four being considered unlucky ( tetraphobia ) in China. [3] OnePlus confirmed that the handset would feature a Snapdragon 835 processor prior to the launch. [4] OnePlus also noted its work with the image processing firm DxO to improve the camera on the device. The OnePlus 5 has an anodized metal back like its predecessors, the OnePlus 3 and 3T. The handset is currently available in Slate Gray (black/gray) and Soft Gold (white/gold) colors. The limited edition Soft Gold color was released on 7 August 2017. [6] A Midnight Black (black/matte black) color was also manufactured, but later removed from their website. Another special edition version made in association with Castelbajac is exclusively available in Europe. It features a Slate Gray back with handwriting, along with colorful hardware buttons, called "JCC Edition" (8/128). The device comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset clocked at 2.45. GHz, with up to 8 GB RAM and 128 GB storage. [8] It has a 3300 mAh battery with OnePlus' proprietary Dash Charge technology and a 1080p AMOLED display [2] with DCI-P3 wide colour gamut. Following criticism of prior models' camera quality, [5] OnePlus implemented an electronically-stabilized 16 MP Sony Exmor IMX398 camera module along with a 20 MP Sony Exmor IMX350 telephoto lens, capable of producing a bokeh effect. The front camera uses a 16MP IMX371 lens. [10] OnePlus claims that the dual camera enables a 1.6X optical zoom; however, independent testing has only reproduced a 1.33X optical zoom. [11] DxOMark gave the camera a rating of 87, which is above that of the iPhone 7. The company released the device tree and kernel sources a few days prior to the phone's launch. [13] It has TWRP and root access. OnePlus 5 was launched with OxygenOS 4.5 based on Android 7.1.1. One feature in OxygenOS is a reading mode. The "Face Unlock" facial recognition feature, originally shipped with the OnePlus 5T , was added to the OnePlus 5 in OxygenOS 5.0.2. The majority of initial reviews of the phone were positive. Engadget praised the phone's specifications in its price bracket. [17] The Verge concurred and noted its departure from previous OnePlus phone designs, but pointed out design similarities with the iPhone 7 Plus. [8] Wired noted that despite the phone's camera specifications, the photo quality was mediocre; however, it commended the smoothness and battery life of the device. XDA Developers noted that the phone was locking the CPU and GPU at their maximum clock speeds while in certain games and benchmarks in order to inflate their benchmark scores, resulting in the phone reaching external temperatures as high as 50. [19] OnePlus co-founder, Carl Pei , defended the actions by saying that users "want to see the full potential of their device without interference from tampering" and that "Every OEM has proprietary performance profiles for their devices". Users noted that the handset had a "jelly scrolling effect" due to an inverted display. [21] [22] [23] OnePlus noted that this was not a defect. Some phones were known to reboot when dialing 911, preventing users from calling emergency services. [25] OnePlus quickly issued an update (OxygenOS 4.5.6) [26] to fix this issue, [27] and claimed that it happened as a result of not using the stock dialing app. [28] OnePlus later said that the problem was "related to a modem memory usage issue", and that it was only a "random occurrence" for some users on VoLTE networks. The OnePlus 5 became the company's fastest selling smartphone, according to CEO Carl Pei. It is also selling better than the previous generation's OnePlus 3T. During the week leading to the device being revealed, a television advertisement was shown in the final of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy between Pakistan and India, starring OnePlus brand ambassador and Indian film star Amitabh Bachchan. OnePlus 5 went on sale in India on 22 June on Amazon , [32] the OnePlus India online store, and the OnePlus Experience store in Bengaluru.

CNET también está disponible en español.. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The OnePlus 5 is affordable and super fast, with an 18-hour battery. Its camera takes great portraits and low-light shots.. The Bad It costs more than any previous model, its design isn't anything special and it doesn’t have expandable storage.. The Bottom Line The OnePlus 5 is outstanding, especially for the price; no other phone gives you the same bang for the buck.. Pricing and where to buy OnePlus 5 pricing. One of the best cameras around. Editors' Note : On Nov.16, 2017, OnePlus announced the OnePlus 5T , a followup to the OnePlus 5. Since the 5T's launch, the OnePlus 5 sold out, and the company is continuing with the 5T.. What follows is our original OnePlus 5 review. Click here to read CNET's review of the OnePlus 5T .. The OnePlus 5 is simply stellar.. It delivers a grade-A experience and nearly all the specs you demand in a flagship phone for hundreds of dollars less than the Samsung Galaxy S8 , Google Pixel and Apple iPhone 7 .. This is the fourth major phone from Chinese phone maker OnePlus, which has earned a reputation for creating cheap, quality Android phones that undercut the competition. While OnePlus doesn't have the volume or pure brand clout as Samsung, Apple and even Huawei, it has garnered a loyal following through flash sales and word-of-mouth recommendations.. The OnePlus 5 excels at serving high-performing hardware, like the latest Snapdragon chipset and an enduring, fast-charging battery. It's also on trend with a dual-lens rear camera that takes artsy portraits and can hold its own against the iPhone 7 Plus .. But it doesn't have super-slim bezels or the water-resistant body that so many top-tier phones do. And its price, while still hundreds less than its top-tier competitors, inches closer to them than years past due to its more expensive features. As a result, the phone isn't quite the deal it once was. But, rest assured, the trade-off is more than fair.. Editors' note : This review has been updated on July 12, 2017, with additional benchmark tests.. One Plus 5: Familiar design but still outstanding. The OnePlus 5 will come in two storage capacity variants (both have no expandable storage) and you'll need to buy direct and unlocked since it's not available through major carriers. It will also only work on GSM networks, like AT&T and T-Mobile in the US (and not Verizon and Sprint). There will be an online " early drop sale " the day of its announcement on June 20. The day after, on June 21, OnePlus will host one-day pop-up shops for the phone in London, Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam, Helsinki and Copenhagen. Finally, on June 27, the device will be available globally on its site for open online purchase .. The OnePlus 5 hopped aboard the dual-camera trend and has two rear shooters. Unlike other phones that have two cameras for wide-angle or monochrome purposes, the phone has a standard 16-megapixel shooter and a secondary 20-megapixel telephoto lens. This enables it to take "bokeh" images that have a shallow depth of field and blurred backgrounds (as if you took the photo with an DSLR camera).. The effect turns my run-of-the-mill photos of my friends into something more artsy and dramatic, and it works the same way the 7 Plus' cameras do. You need to stand 1-6 feet away from your subject to use the effect, and there were times when the camera didn't recognize or "catch" the subject initially. But when it worked, my pictures looked great. Due to its longer focal length, the telephoto lens has a fixed optical 1.6x zoom (it then adds digital " multi-frame technology " to bring it up to 2X), so you can toggle between the standard lens or zoom in on distant objects clearly and steadily with the telephoto.. The effect doesn't always work perfectly every time on both the OnePlus and the iPhone. It can be patchy around objects with tricky outlines (like with stray hairs and such). But the iPhone did a slightly better job at reading these situations and determining where best the blurring should start and end. The iPhone's bokeh effect also looked softer and more natural at times. In some of the OnePlus' portraits, the foreground looked too harshly contrasted with the blurred background, and the effect looked too digitally rendered. (Check out CNET's full OnePlus 5 vs. iPhone 7 Plus camera comparison here .). Portrait mode on the OnePlus 5 (left) and iPhone 7 Plus (right).. The OnePlus 5 takes excellent low-light pictures, better even than the pricier Pixel at times. That's due to a combination of better processing technology from OnePlus and a slightly wider aperture (f1.7 versus f2.0 on the Pixel), which lets in more light. And in photography, light is everything. Many of the OnePlus' photos were clearer and sharper (with less digital artifacting) than the Pixel. White balance was also more accurate, since the Pixel gave off a slight greenish hue with some of my dark, indoor shooting.. Shooting in low light with the OnePlus 5 (left) and Pixel (right).. In general, the OnePlus 5 has a superb camera (and its 16-megapixel front-facing shooter takes sharp selfies as well), if not one of the best camera phones around. When it comes to regular day-to-day shooting, though, personal preference comes into play -- especially when all premium phones carry first-rate cameras.. For instance, in a few photos, the OnePlus had deeper reds and purples than the Galaxy S8. This gave objects more vibrancy and depth, while the S8 came off flatter. At the same time, however, the OnePlus rendered skin tones darker and more orange, whereas on the S8 (and the iPhone too, actually), people's complexions looked more true to life. The S8 also had a more accurate white balance indoors, with whites being much more purer and brighter. (Check out CNET's more extensive camera shootout with the OnePlus 5, the Galaxy and Google Pixel here .). While there were some situations when the iPhone, S8 and Pixel had an edge, all of them have their own strengths and weaknesses. The OnePlus 5 is the only phone that we know that has two cameras for the bokeh effect with that high of a megapixel count. What's more, while the camera is competing neck-and-neck against these rivals, keep in mind it's doing it at hundreds of dollars less than the others.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

OnePlus 5: Top things you need to know. It's hard to ignore the importance of this phone in the Android world.. The OnePlus 5T is on its way. The OnePlus 5 is the most expensive phone the company has ever made, and subsequently has the highest expectations. The base plan to meet those expectations is to double down on the formula that has at least got OnePlus this far: high-end specs, solid hardware and super-fast software. Then there's the extra bit of marketing thrown behind its camera setup, which is the first substantial change to the formula of previous OnePlus phones.. The best place to get up to speed with the OnePlus 5 is right here — here are the top things you need to know about this phone.. A whole heap of top-notch specs. Around the middle of October, OnePlus stopped selling the OnePlus 5. The prevailing wisdom is that OnePlus is making room to begin selling the OnePlus 5T when that is officially announced.. More: OnePlus 5T could be unveiled on November 16. Some things remain unchanged from the OnePlus 3 and 3T. For another generation, OnePlus is giving us just about all of the top-end specs we want to see in a high-end phone today. It starts with the latest Snapdragon 835 processor, and continues on with a standard 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. There's also an optional 8GB RAM and 128GB storage model for just $60 extra.. You'll also see an above-average 3300mAh battery inside despite the phone's 7.25 mm thickness, and it offers quick charging that can match or exceed how quickly other phones charge up with their Quick Charge 3.0 tech. You get USB-C connectivity, of course, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack — unfortunately, an increasingly rare item these days.. More: Spec comparison: OnePlus 5 vs. But of course, a phone that starts at $479 can't do it all. There are still a few specs and features "missing" here that you could find on other phones ... but the biggest one is waterproofing.. Yup, you won't find an IP rating at all on the OnePlus 5, and that's something you find in just about all of the flagship competition. No matter that those phones are $150-250 more than the OnePlus 5, because OnePlus is definitely framing its latest phone as a competitor to those flagships.. OxygenOS is one of the best software experiences today. You now have two rear cameras. It works just about anywhere in the world ... For all of the advancements in the OnePlus 5, some parts of its experience have remain unchanged — or imperceptibly changed — from its predecessor, the OnePlus 3.. Much of what you find on the OnePlus 5 was introduced in 2016's OnePlus 3.. Some key parts of the hardware experience are the same now as they were before, including the 5.5-inch 1080p display, the one-touch fingerprint sensor below the screen, the great "Alert Slider" on the left edge, and the Dash Charge fast charging system. The phone's dimensions are also near-identical, with the OnePlus 5 being marginally thinner and narrower, and just shy of 2 mm taller.. The Android 7.1 Nougat software on the OnePlus 5 is also very similar in features to the OnePlus 3, particularly if you've dabbled in any of the beta builds for the older phone where the new software has been in testing. The experience of using the phones side-by-side today is hardly different, and the small differences can (and should) be brought to the OnePlus 3 in due time.. In many cases the stagnation isn't a bad thing, but it is worth noting that the OnePlus 5 has strong continuity with the phone that came before it.. After a few early stumbles with its execution, OnePlus has created one of the best software experiences available on an Android phone today. OxygenOS , as OnePlus calls it, is based on the latest Android Nougat build from Google but also integrates several super-useful features that so many people desire in their phone.. You can tweak all sorts of little things like the status bar, launcher, theme, icon packs and the notification LED. But you can also change larger areas like choosing between on-screen or capacitive navigation keys, and adding screen-off gestures to launch specific functions and apps.. More: The OnePlus 5 is filled with great little software customizations. The best part about all of these changes is that they don't get in your way if you don't want them, and don't detract from the overall clean experience offered by Android the way it comes from Google. Performance on the OnePlus 5 doesn't suffer, either, which we can all be happy about.. A substantial area of change when compared to the OnePlus 3 is the OnePlus 5's camera setup. The new phone has a new 16MP camera, a faster f/1.7 lens and new image processing techniques, but has lost OIS (optical image stabilization) in the process. The main camera feels like an overall upgrade from the OnePlus 3, and it's capable of taking some great photos. But its lack of physical stabilization hamstrings it in scenes with mixed or little light, and the results end up being a bit grainy or blurry if you're not careful with stabilizing your hands.. Dual cameras give you new options — and one important omission.. Sitting right next to the "main" camera is another camera as well: a 20MP sensor with an f/2.6 lens that has a longer focal length — around 40 mm equivalent to the main's 24 mm. You can tap the "2x" button in the camera app to quickly switch to this lens and take photos with a unique perspective — and because it has 20MP of resolution you can even digitally zoom in a tad without losing much fidelity.. More: The OnePlus 5 has a DxOMark Mobile score of 87. The big reason for including the second camera is "Portrait Mode," which is a way to use both lenses at once to create a faux background blurring effect to try and mimic what you'd see in a DSLR. It can be hit or miss (this software is really hard to do right), but when it works you get a cool-looking photo that's different from what you'd see from either camera on its own.. Dash Charge is awesome, but has some requirements. Read our review and other coverage. OnePlus surpassed a pretty big technological hurdle to be able to ship one model of the phone with radio support for 30+ countries — particularly in facing the Chinese market that uses many bands you don't find anywhere else. That means you can take your phone to most places in the world and have it work on the local carrier, which is great for international travelers. There are also two SIM slots, giving you even more possibilities.. More: There's one OnePlus 5 version for the whole world. The one shortcoming, speaking purely from a U.S. perspective, is its lack of support for Verizon and Sprint. Even though the OnePlus 5 technically supports some of the necessary LTE bands for the carriers, OnePlus is making no claim of testing or certification for those networks. It's annoying and frustrating, but you shouldn't buy the OnePlus 5 expecting to use it on Verizon or Sprint.. If you bring the OnePlus 5 to T-Mobile you'll find it works great, including support for both VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling. Unfortunately those advanced calling features aren't available on AT&T — you'll get the basic voice and data services there.. The in-house developed Dash Charge charging system helps your OnePlus 5's battery charge up incredibly fast. But because of the way the charger has to interact with the phone to perform the fast charging without generating much heat, it requires a special charger and cable. You must use a OnePlus-made Dash Charge charger and cable, or it just won't work. OnePlus includes the correct charger and cable in the OnePlus 5's box, and also offers extra wall chargers and car chargers on its website .. The only frustrating part about Dash Charge is that it isn't cross-compatible with other fast charging systems, like the widely used Qualcomm Quick Charge or the more generic USB-C Power Delivery spec. That means if you plug into another charger (or use another cable) it will likely top out at about 5V/2.4A — which is pretty fast, but not nearly as fast as Dash Charge is.. Get to know the OnePlus 5 in detail by reading our comprehensive review , as well as our second take review.

Press enter or click on the search icon. Not as cheap as previous models, but still great value. With the OnePlus 3 , the Chinese ‘start-up’ finally made a phone that was nearly perfect. There’s no OnePlus 4 this year, but instead the OnePlus 5 takes things up another level with a seriously packed spec sheet – and a higher price.. The headline feature here is an interesting dual-camera setup on the back, but in typical OnePlus fashion there’s a serious amount of power and the option of a frankly ridiculous 8GB of RAM.. Related: When will my phone get Android Oreo?. For £449/$479, the OnePlus 5 is a fantastic deal, but the higher price necessitates a more critical look at some of its shortcomings. There are a few missing features and some odd omissions, but this is still one of the best tech bargains.. One of our favourite phones of 2017, the OnePlus 5, is now available in a shiny new colour.. Like previous OnePlus devices, the 5 can now be picked up in Soft Gold. Sitting alongside black and ‘slightly less black’ – or Midnight Black and Slate Grey – Soft Gold is far from blingy and actually looks almost silver in certain light.. The gold back is paired with a white front, though it would have been nice for OnePlus to keep this black.. The Soft Gold variant will be available in limited quantities for £449/$479, and will only ship with the 6GB/64GB internal options.. The OnePlus 5 is a really good-looking phone, but it’s not the most original. The back reminds me of an slightly curvier matte-black iPhone 7 Plus , right down to the camera arrangement, the blended antenna lines and even the flash. The front is pretty much the same as those of the outgoing OnePlus 3 and 3T, which is no bad thing, but in a world of the Essential Phone and LG G6 it feels a bit old-fashioned.. Old-fashioned is acceptable in this case, though, because OnePlus has managed to make this phone so comfortable to hold and a pleasure to use. The curved back fits perfectly in your palm, while the 3D Gorilla Glass 5 on the front also curves slightly. This multitude of curves make it super-slim, but also easy to fish up from a table.. The OnePlus 5 with its 5.5-inch display is a larger phone than the 5.8-inch Samsung Galaxy S8 , but it’s smaller in all dimensions than the same-screen-size iPhone 7 Plus. It doesn’t feel big, although I have become used to this size of phone now, and I can reach all the elements of the screen with one hand.. Previous OnePlus devices have felt great for their price, which tended to be below £350, but even though the OnePlus starts at £449 it still feels better built than anything else in that price range. Everything is precisely cut, it feels sturdy and there are really neat touches like the alert slider that sits above the volume rocker. I know this has been a OnePlus staple, but I’m appreciating being able to quickly flip the phone into silent mode when it’s still in my pocket more and more..

There’s a headphone jack and Dash Charge-capable USB-C port on the bottom, along with a microphone and mono speaker, plus a dual-Nano SIM tray on the side. I’d have preferred a microSD slot, or a hybrid slot, but at least there’s a decent amount of base storage here.. The OnePlus 5 comes in two colours, though to be honest they look almost exactly the same. The 64GB model has 6GB RAM and comes in ‘Slate Grey’ while the 128GB/8GB RAM version takes the ‘Midnight Black’ hue that was briefly available on the OnePlus 3T. Both colours are deep, dark and matte, and it feels odd to have two options so similar.. The lack of any sort of water-resistance rating is slightly disappointing, but not a deal beaker yet.. OnePlus has stepped up the game in the vast majority of areas this year, but on paper at least the screen feels very much the same. It’s still a 5.5-inch AMOLED panel, which is still 1080p as opposed to the more common quad-HD resolution.. The OnePlus 3 (and 3T) suffered from a few annoying screen issues, including poor calibration and laggy scrolling, but the OnePlus 5 sorts these out. So that’s a bonus straight away.. The display now covers the wide DCI-P3 colour gamut, like the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S8, and this is my preferred colour profile. It gives colours more of a punch, without oversaturating, and there’s more variety in the shades. There’s an sRGB mode too that removes a bit of the punch, and a Default mode that feels to me a bit too colourful.. I would have liked to see a resolution bump, but in all honestly it’s tough to pick out individual pixels unless you get really close. It’s not as sharp as the HTC U11 , nor is it as sharp as a 5-inch 1080p device, but colours are nice and because it’s AMOLED there’s that extra depth to blacks that you don’t get with LCD.. Gorilla Glass 5 covers the panel and that should help prevent scratches, but I have still found small hairline scratches appear on the display after a week of use..

The OnePlus 5 is no longer available, after it was replaced by the OnePlus 5T. A great camera, phenomenal performance and a premium design combine to make this a fantastic buy for anyone looking for a more affordable flagship phone.. OnePlus 5 price and release date Two versions: started at $479 (£449, AU$599) Out of stock on OnePlus website in US, UK and AUS. Key features New premium design makes it the best-looking OnePlus phone yet Dual-lens camera allows for lossless zoom, like the iPhone 7 Plus Design Thinnest phone OnePlus has ever made There's still a 3.5mm headphone jack for wired headsets Only available in two colors – dark gray or deep black Display 5.5-inch Full HD AMOLED screen looks great Makes for a display with 401 pixels-per-inch. The OnePlus 5 was a great, affordable flagship smartphone, but it was short lived. Less than six months after its June 2017 launch, you could no longer buy the handset. The reason? The excellent OnePlus 5T showed up for the same price, while offering more.. [Update: You can no longer purchase the OnePlus 5. It's been replaced by the OnePlus 5T , which offers smaller bezels, a bigger screen, face unlock and improved rear cameras - all for the same price as the OnePlus 5.]. Looking at the OnePlus 5, it's hard to believe that the company that made it was less than four years old. This is a phone that manages to hold its own alongside flagship devices from companies that have enormous pots of money to spend on research, development and design, and a decade or more of experience making smartphones.. OnePlus has always made impressive phones at sub-flagship prices, but with this iteration the Chinese company has learned from previous mistakes, and built on its successes, to create an all-round fantastic phone.. Weight : 153g Dimensions : 154.2 x 74.1 x 7.25mm OS : Android 7.1.1 Nougat Screen size : 5.5-inch Resolution : 1920 x 1080 CPU : Snapdragon 835 RAM : 6GB or 8GB of RAM Storage : 64/128GB Battery : 3,300mAh Rear camera : 16MP + 20MP dual lens Front camera : 16MP. The OnePlus 5 price was more than the OnePlus 3T. That's the hard truth about the new phone, but it's partly because OnePlus decided to use more premium materials.. OnePlus produced two versions of the OnePlus 5, with the base model coming with 64GB of internal storage and 6GB of RAM, costing $479 (£449, AU$599).. The higher-end version, with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, wass priced at $539 (£499, AU$699) and that's the device we reviewed here.. Whichever version you buy, it's a big price jump compared to the OnePlus 3T, which cost $439 (£399, around AU$580) for the 64GB model and $479 (£439, around AU$630) for the 128GB version.. And bear in mind that OnePlus had already increased the price for that phone release – the OnePlus 3 , released in June 2016, was only $399 (£329, around AU$450). If you’re looking to upgrade the OnePlus phone you bought this time last year, you’re going to be spending quite a bit more than you may have anticipated on the OnePlus 5.. The official OnePlus 5 release date was June 27, but it's now out of stock on the OnePlus website it most countries, including the US, UK and Australia.. Looking at the spec list for the OnePlus 5, you might think this is a rather limited upgrade, but there a few key features the company is pushing to make this the next phone you’ll want to buy, first and foremost of which is the new camera.. This is now a dual-lens setup that allows you to capture some attractive-looking 'bokeh' shots with artfully blurred backgrounds, as well as boasting a 'lossless' zoom feature, which essentially means that zooming in on subjects will only result in a negligible reduction in image quality.. This feature works in a similar way to the shooter on the iPhone 7 Plus , but here you're getting it on a more affordable phone. The aperture on the main sensor here is also impressively wide, and it means you’ll be able to take some of the best smartphone photos possible right now.. The design of the new phone feels like a big step up for OnePlus. It's still using the same materials as the OnePlus 3T – the body is made of anodized aluminum – but this is the slimmest and most attractive OnePlus phone to date.. OnePlus also wants this to be the most powerful phone on the market – and the good news is it's succeeded, with our testing showing it to have the strongest benchmarking scores of any device on the market at the time of testing.. The OnePlus 5 is the best-looking device the company has made to date. When you pick this phone up you can tell right away that it’s made with premium-grade materials.. The new handset has a more rounded design than previous iterations, which means it sits comfortably in your palm. It’s also the thinnest phone yet from OnePlus at 7.25mm – almost as thin as the iPhone 7 , which is 7.1mm. It feels light in the hand – it weighs 153g to be precise – but not so light that you feel like it may blow away in a forceful gust of wind.. OnePlus is talking up the placement of the antenna bands here. According to a spokesperson the color has been specifically designed to try and hide the antenna bands for an unspoiled full-metal look, and when you do spot them they don't detract from the design of the phone.. On the right-hand edge of the phone sits the power button, with nothing else to interrupt the clean lines. The left edge features the toggle for silent mode, as well as the volume rocker.. The inclusion of the silent switch is an intriguing one. It's something OnePlus has included on every phone since the OnePlus 2, and it's still the only major Android phone player to do so.. Apple is the only other manufacturer that has persisted with the silent switch, but its inclusion on the OnePlus 5 is welcome. It makes it super easy to make the handset cinema, meeting and bedtime ready, and we like that.. There’s only one speaker driver, and that sits at the bottom of the phone, next to the USB-C port and 3.5mm headphone jack… yes, despite all the rumors OnePlus has decided to retain the legacy headphone technology for the OnePlus 5.. No awkward dongles required here (we're looking at you Apple, HTC and Moto), but Bluetooth is also on board if you fancy going wire-free.. OnePlus is also trying to sell us on what it calls the ‘Horizon Line’, the idea here being that half of the phone is cast in shadow while the other is in light. We're struggling to get on board with this, but it’s also easy to see that this is a beautiful-looking phone that feels elegant in use.. One shortcoming in terms of the design of the OnePlus 5 is that it’s not waterproof. A OnePlus spokesperson confirmed to TechRadar that it would survive a drop of rain if you need to use it outside, but it’s not IP-rated, and won’t survive a dunk like the Samsung Galaxy S8 , Sony Xperia XZ or iPhone 7 will.. The OnePlus 5 is only available in two colors, and these are tied to the storage/RAM options. The 64GB/6GB version comes in Slate Gray, while the more expensive 128GB/8GB model comes in Midnight Black.. So if you’re fussy about the color you want then you can’t be fussy about the power and storage you get under the hood, and vice versa.. The big headline display-wise is that OnePlus hasn’t decided to upgrade to a QHD resolution screen for the OnePlus 5 at all. That means you get the same 5.5-inch Full HD AMOLED display from the OnePlus 3T, and it is a little hard not to be disappointed by that considering the increase in price of the handset this year.. Of course, OnePlus needs to cut a couple of corners to keep its price tag competitively below its rivals, and to be fair the screen is one of the very few places where it's decided to make a saving.. The good news is that the screen on the OnePlus 5 still looks beautiful. It’s a shame the company hasn’t opted for a higher resolution, but at 401 pixels per inch it looks great when you’re watching video, and as it’s AMOLED, blacks and other dark tones look great.. Corning’s Gorilla Glass 5 tech is also present to ensure you’re getting a fully protected screen, and to ward off scratches.. Next Page What it's like to use?.

OnePlus 5 Rumors News – Launch Date, Specifications, Updates. Oneplus 5 Review – Specification, Features, Release Date, Price. September 8, 2017 September 8, 2017 1 Comment. OnePlus 5 Rumors – Specs, and Launch Date & Update:. Display: According to the rumors, OnePlus 5 is expected to have a. larger screen of 5.5-inches, as that will be more attractive for watching the better video quality.

The OnePlus 5 is an attractive unlocked phone with fast performance, solid camera capabilities, and excellent battery life, but it's not as strong a value as previous models.. You might be asking yourself, what happened to the OnePlus 4? Worry not, you didn't take a nap and wake up in 2018. The unlocked OnePlus 5 ($479, 64GB/6GB RAM) is the successor to the OnePlus 3T —OnePlus is a Chinese company, and t he number 4 is considered unlucky in China, so it is often skipped. You still get many of the same benefits with the OnePlus 5 as you do with other OnePlus phones, including a powerful processor, loads of RAM, solid camera performance, and excellent battery life. But the price point has increased, so the phone doesn't represent quite the same value proposition as earlier models. That said, it's a compelling alternative to expensive flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S8.. Let's get the obvious out of the way. Yes, the OnePlus 5 resembles the iPhone 7 Plus , but so do most phones with dual rear cameras. There's really only so many places you can put things when you're working with a rectangular metal slab, and OnePlus manages to nail the familiar design elements in a classy manner.. Available in Midnight Black (pictured) and Slate Gray, the OnePlus 5 has a sleek metal unibody design that's free from antenna lines. It's smooth and a bit slippery to the touch, but doesn't pick up fingerprints.. The phone measures 6.1 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and tips the scales at a modest 5.4 ounces. It's the slimmest and lightest phone we've seen from the company, weighing just less than the bezel-free Samsung Galaxy S8 (5.9 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces). It's substantially lighter in your pocket than the HTC U11 (6.1 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 6.0 ounces) and the ZTE Axon 7 (6.0 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches, 6.2 ounces). I didn't have much difficulty using it with one hand, as a thin bezel makes it easy to reach across.. The right side of the phone holds dual SIM card slots and a power button that launches the camera app when you press it twice. The bottom has a 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB-C charging port, and a modestly loud bottom-firing mono speaker. The left side has a useful alert slider to switch between Ring, Silent, and Do Not Disturb modes.. View All 6 Photos in Gallery. The fingerprint scanner is below the display—it doubles as a capacitive home button, and is flanked by back and recent buttons. Each button is programmable, with alternate functions available to launch a voice assistant, enable Split Screen mode, or open the notification center. Each button can have a different function enabled for a long press or a double tap. Other customization options include swapping the order of the buttons, or turning them off entirely in favor of an on-screen navigation bar.. One design element to keep in mind is that the OnePlus 5 isn't waterproof, unlike most current flagship phones, so you'll want to keep it dry. Though, according to OnePlus, it should be able to handle the occasional splash.. The display is a 5.5-inch 1,920-by-1,080 AMOLED panel covered in a protective layer of Gorilla Glass 5 that curves to meet the edges. This is the same resolution as the previous model, which is a bit disappointing considering the $400 Axon 7 has a Quad HD panel. Still, it's sharp for the size, with 401 pixels packed into every inch, the same as the iPhone 7 Plus. It just isn't quite as crisp as the Axon 7 (538ppi) or the Galaxy S8 (570ppi).. The screen does have its strong points, though. The AMOLED panel gives you rich, saturated colors and inky blacks. It gets very bright and I had no difficulty using the phone outdoors in direct sunlight. Color temperature can be customized, with accurate reproduction in the default mode, but options to make it warmer or cooler, and a Night mode that kicks in to help your eyes in the late hours and a Reading mode that sets everything to grayscale. If you're concerned about battery life, you can enable the Dark theme that sets all menu backgrounds to black and saves power by only lighting the pixels you need.. As with every OnePlus phone, the 5 only works on GSM carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile. It supports GSM (850/900/1800/1900MHz), UMTS (1/2/4/5/8), and LTE bands (1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/17/18/19/20/25/26/28/29/30/34/39/40/41/66). Both US and international versions get the same set of bands, which is useful if you plan on traveling. Because of its Snapdragon 835 processor, the OnePlus 5 comes with an X16 modem, but it's capped at Cat 12 LTE down (600Mbps) and Cat 13 LTE up (150Mbps).. That means you won't get gigabit speeds (Cat 16) once those networks are up and running. It's not a big deal right now since no carrier has a gigabit network outside of certain test cities, but if you're planning to keep the phone for a couple of years, you won't enjoy faster speeds as they roll out nationally.. That said, network connectivity is only going to be as good as your carrier. In heavily congested midtown Manhattan, I got crawling single digit download speeds on AT&T, which was in line with the Galaxy S8 I was testing at the same time.. Other connectivity protocols supported are NFC, so you can use Android Pay, dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz/5GHz), and Bluetooth 5.0, which pairs with multiple speakers or headphones and improves range, speed, and quality.. Call quality was decent, but nothing to write home about. Earpiece volume is loud and noise cancellation blots out traffic and voices, but wind causes significant crackling. Voices are also on the robotic side.. The phone doesn't support high-resolution audio like the Axon 7 , but with wired headphones you do get a built-in audio tuner that provides fine balance controls with equalizer presets for different genres of music and enhancements for certain headphones like the OnePlus Bullets or JBL E1+. Those earphones aren't included, so I wasn't able to test this feature.. As mentioned, the OnePlus 5 is powered a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, the same chipset in all current top-tier flagships. It's clocked at 2.45GHz, supports UFS 2.1 flash storage, and comes with either 6GB or 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM (the 8GB model, with 128GB of storage, costs $539). Simply put, it's one of the fastest Android phones we've ever tested.. On the AnTuTu benchmark (which only recognized 4GB of RAM as usable) it scored 184,249, surpassing flagships like the U11 (175,241) and S8 (158,266) due to the less-demanding 1080p display. On Geekbench, the OnePlus 5 scored 1,971 single-core and 6,764 multi-core, once again outperforming the U11 (1,913/6,538) and S8 (1,836/5,960).. It should go without saying that real-world performance is incredibly smooth. Whether it's multitasking, demanding games like Modern Combat and GTA: San Andreas, or twenty open tabs in Chrome, nothing causes the OnePlus 5 to skip a beat. You likely won't ever need 8GB of RAM, so the 6GB model should be plenty if you want to save some money.. See How We Test Cell Phones. The phone clocked 9 hours, 15 minutes when we streamed full-screen video over LTE at maximum screen brightness. That's not quite as long as the OnePlus 3T, which lasted over 10 hours, but it's understandable because battery capacity has been reduced by 100mAh (to 3,300mAh) to accommodate the smaller form factor. The OnePlus 5 is still one of the longest-lasting phones we've tested this year, surpassing the S8 (5 hours, 45 minutes), LG G6 (5 hours, 57 minutes), and U11 (7 hours, 1 minute). Proprietary fast charging juices up the phone to 50 percent in 30 minutes, and 100 percent in a little over an hour, matching Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0.. The OnePlus 5 has dual rear camera sensors that serve the same purpose as the ones on the iPhone 7 Plus and Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom. You have a 16-megapixel main sensor backed by a wide-angle lens, and a 20-megapixel sensor with a tighter field of view, delivering 1.6x optical zoom with software tweaks to achieve 2.0x lossless zoom. In well-lit conditions, the sensors produce sharp images with crisp details and accurate color reproduction.. The 20MP telephoto camera maintains a high level of clarity when you zoom in. In the images below, you can see that shots from both lenses are equally sharp, sidestepping the image degradation you'd deal with by utilizing the digital zoom feature on a single-lens phone.. The difference in zoom quality comes across most clearly between the OnePlus 5 and the Galaxy S8, with the OnePlus 5 showing the individual spines of the plant at the same zoom level.. In a shootout with the Galaxy S8, the OnePlus 5 holds its own with pictures taken outdoors. In our comparison shots below, both phones capture sharp images outside, with a high degree of overall clarity and minimal noise. But the S8 wins with finer details. The brick work of buildings comes across more clearly, individual leaves are more defined, and objects in the distance are just a bit sharper.. The contrast is more pronounced in low light. In a series of pictures taken indoors, the S8 pulled ahead with clearer, less blurry images. Because it has optical image stabilization (OIS), the S8 minimizes blur when shooting in dim conditions; the OnePlus 5 uses electronic image stabilization (EIS) to steady shots. The S8's autofocus system is also quicker in dim light.. The OnePlus 5 can record 4K video at 30fps and 1080p at 60fps. Quality is good, but the lack of OIS comes into play, with video from the OnePlus showing more shake than you get with handheld footage from the Galaxy S8.. The front-facing 16-megapixel camera delivers excellent image and video quality. Autofocus and autoexposure are both fast and responsive and pictures are crisp. Like the rear camera, the front camera has EIS, letting you take clear and stable 1080p video at 30fps. In low light, pictures sometimes have patches of noise, but you'll encounter the same with the S8.. Like the S8, the OnePlus 5 has manual controls that let you tweak ISO, white balance, focus, shutter speed, and other settings. You can also shoot in Raw for higher-quality images that can be edited later.. Overall, the S8 remains the top camera phone on the market right now, especially when it comes to low-light shooting, but the OnePlus 5 isnt too far behind, and quite impressive for the price.. The OnePlus 5 comes running Android 7.1.1 Nougat , the same version you get on the Google Pixel XL. It has OxygenOS on top, a lightweight skin with a design that keeps the clean appearance of stock Android, but adds some extra features. Swiping left from the home screen brings a custom widget screen that shows weather, memos, recent contacts, recently used apps, used storage, data, and battery life. You also have the option of adding additional widgets.. Other customization options include a built-in manager for themes, custom app icon support, rearrangeable buttons, and different accents and colors for the settings menu and status bar. You can also lock individual apps and require a password or fingerprint verification to unlock them. Gestures are supported, allowing you to double tap the phone to wake it, draw on the screen to launch different apps, and use a three-finger swipe to take a screenshot.. There's a few preinstalled apps, most of which can be deleted. Whether you opt for the 64GB or 128GB version, there's plenty of space for apps, photos, and video. That said, there is no microSD card slot, so storage isn't expandable.. At $539 for the 128GB model and $479 for the 64GB model, the OnePlus 5 is the company's most costly phone yet. But then, in many aspects, you're getting many of the same features you find in phones that cost $200 to $300 more. The OnePlus 5 has the latest Snapdragon 835 processor with plenty of RAM, sharp cameras with optical zoom, and excellent battery life. Screen resolution is fine, but not up to par with the competition, there's no waterproofing or expandable storage, and the modem is capped to Cat 12 speeds.. If you want to best of all worlds, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is our Editors' Choice, though it'll cost you a pretty penny more. If you want to save some money , the $400 ZTE Axon 7 remains a great choice. It has a Quad HD display, loud front-facing stereo speakers, high-resolution audio, and runs the latest version of Android. It has a slightly older Snapdragon 820 processor, but that might be a worthwhile trade-off if you prefer the sharper display. If you simply want the fastest performance possible for the best price, however, the OnePlus 5 is an excellent choice.. Bottom Line: The OnePlus 5 is an attractive unlocked phone with fast performance, solid camera capabilities, and excellent battery life, but it's not as strong a value as previous models..

The OnePlus 5 gets so much right, it’ll change the way we think about flagship smartphones. The OnePlus 5 gets so much right, it’ll change the way we think about flagship smartphones. The OnePlus 5 gets so much right, it’ll change the way we think about flagship smartphones. Wonderfully accessible software and user experience. Image tuning won’t be for everyone. Looks a lot like an iPhone. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. OnePlus sells one phone, which means to be successful, that device needs to be very good — talk about pressure. The OnePlus 3T has always been easy to recommend. It does everything pretty well, and costs less than many big-name rivals. Now it’s time for the sequel, but just because the OnePlus 3T is good, doesn’t mean the pressure is off. If anything, there’s more this time around.. The OnePlus 5 refines what made the OnePlus 3T so desirable even further. It does more, has more power, and looks even smarter. But what we really like is how it’s so incredibly accessible — the software is simple, and the features easy to understand. You just settle into using the OnePlus 5 like sinking down into your favorite chair. This accessibility is really important; OnePlus has a somewhat geeky image, like it’s only suitable for tech-enthusiasts. The OnePlus 5 proves this isn’t true at all.. Apple is a master at making phones like this, and the iPhone’s influence runs through the OnePlus 5 very clearly. It sometimes steps over the line from homage to imitation. Our OnePlus 5 review shows how the company impressively manages to rise above this, to achieve a level of brilliance that separates it from other high-end smartphones. From the back, the OnePlus 5 really, really looks like an iPhone. The midnight black color scheme, carried over from the limited edition OnePlus 3T, is extremely close in shade to the matte black iPhone. The OnePlus logo shines in glossy black in the top center, and in the top left is a dual-lens camera flanked by a flash unit. Body-colored antenna bands curve around both ends of the OnePlus 5, just like they do on the iPhone.. In the past, companies like Huawei have been accused of copying the iPhone’s design, and while it still does to a certain extent, it has found its own style more recently. OnePlus says the OnePlus 5 is the result of its most expensive design process yet, and more than 100 prototypes were made before deciding on this one. It’s surprising then, to see it came up with an unashamed and unsubtle iPhone clone. The fact it’s reminiscent of the iPhone doesn’t make it ugly — it actually looks very attractive.. The edges of the rear curve towards the front display, which makes it feel natural in the hand — but it doesn’t allow a firm grip. It doesn’t help that our midnight black variant is quite slippery, too.. The right side features a power button, and on the left is the volume rocker, along with OnePlus’ excellent Alert Slider. It quickly switches between alert notification profiles, and It’s very helpful, allowing you to silence your phone without actually looking at the screen. The slider is textured so you don’t even need to take the phone out of your pocket.. It does more, has more power, and looks even smarter.. The OnePlus 5 is also really thin and light. The metal body weighs 153 grams and is 7.25mm thick, which is thinner than the 8mm Samsung Galaxy S8 , and a tad lighter. On the front, a 2.5D curved piece of Gorilla Glass 5 covers the 5.5-inch, 1,920 × 1,080 pixel AMOLED screen. A fingerprint sensor hides inside the home button. It’s not a physical button, but it offers a pleasing vibration when pressed. The Recents and back button flank the home button — there’s no distinctive icon, but they light up when pressed.. There’s no denying the OnePlus 5 looks like an iPhone; but no, it shouldn’t put you off. It still looks great, the build quality is excellent, it has a 3.5mm headphone jack, and it’s super thin.. When we commented on the OnePlus 5’s accessibility, we were referring to how pleasant the phone is to use. This is due to the Android 7.1.1 Nougat operating system and OnePlus’s own Oxygen 4.5.0 user interface, along with the Snapdragon 835 processor and 8GB of RAM. The OnePlus 5 is a fiery combination of raw ability and careful software tweaks, producing a devastatingly fast yet friendly-to-use smartphone.. An example of this is the camera app. On the LG G6 , the Square Camera app — which makes good use of the phone’s wide screen — is a widget, and not built into the main camera app. If it gets deleted, or hidden, you have to know to look for it in the widget menu. The OnePlus 5’s Portrait mode is accessed with a swipe to the left in the main camera app. Swipe to the right for video. A devastatingly fast yet friendly to use smartphone. The Oxygen user interface is very subtle, and unlike others, doesn’t obfuscate primary Android features. In fact, it’s quite similar to the software experience on the Google Pixel. The app drawer is accessed with an upward swipe, the notification shade is standard, and the icons are minimalist and not over-styled. OnePlus’ Shelf feature is one of the few alterations. It’s hidden to the left of the home screen, and shows handy, glanceable pieces of information, but it can be deactivated if you prefer. Other features include an auto night mode that uses the ambient light sensor to adjust the color temperature of the screen, a blue-light filtering reading mode, a do-not-disturb game mode, and a tap-to-wake option for the screen.. Oxygen OS is fluid, the animations are slick, and we never experienced any slowdown at all. The OnePlus 5 is a joy to use, and it’s not just raw power that makes this possible. OnePlus has implemented a special algorithm that preloads frequently used apps, and shifts resources away from apps that are rarely used. It has also worked to optimize the screen for touch sensitivity, making it very responsive indeed. Put all this together, and the end result is sublime. We tested it against a Google Pixel, opening apps at the same time, and the OnePlus 5 was a hair faster. To be fair, the Pixel does have an older processor.. Google Assistant is onboard, and after a period where it refused to work in the United Kingdom after the phone’s release, it operates without a problem now.. We’ve played a series of games on the OnePlus 5, from Happy Hop and Parking Master 3D, to Dodonpachi Unlimited and Reckless Racing 3, without any overheating issues or any slowdown. Streaming video is also faultless, and doesn’t suck much power — a 22-minute show streamed from Crunchyroll only used 4 percent battery life.. Qualcomm’s newest, and fastest processor — the Snapdragon 835 — definitely helps the OnePlus 5 achieve all this. Here are some benchmark scores we received:. By comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S8, which has the same processor and a little less RAM, received a score of 155,253 on AnTuTu, and 2,052 on 3DMark. There’s a word for what happened here, and it’s “trounced.”. It’s crucial to note, however, that at least one third-party reviewer found evidence of benchmark manipulation. According to XDA Developers , the OnePlus 5 keeps CPU frequencies artificially high during the test, which results in significantly higher overall scores in the multi-core test.. “People use benchmark apps in order to ascertain the performance of their device, and we want users to see the true performance of the OnePlus 5,” OnePlus told Digital Trends in statement. “Therefore, we have allowed benchmark apps to run in a state similar to daily usage, including the running of resource intensive apps and games. Additionally, when launching apps the OnePlus 5 runs at a similar state in order to increase the speed in which apps open. We are not overclocking the device, rather we are displaying the performance potential of the OnePlus 5.”. In subsequent statements, the company clarified that it isn’t overclocking the OnePlus 5’s processor, and that it hasn’t implemented a “frequency floor” to boost performance.. “We have set the OnePlus 5 to run benchmarks at a high-performance level […] so that users can see the true potential of the device,” OnePlus said. “We are confident our approach best displays the true performance capabilities of the OnePlus 5.”. Regardless, take the benchmark scores with a grain of salt. We’ve yet to see any performance issues with the OnePlus 5 itself.. The difference between the two versions of the OnePlus 5 comes down to RAM and storage space. The $480 version has 6GB/64GB, and the $540 model has 8GB/128GB. We asked a few experts , and the difference is marginal, and you likely won’t be using anywhere close to 8GB — if anything, more RAM may use up more battery. OnePlus justifies such a giant number by saying it allows more apps to run in the background, and it helps futureproof the phone.. “With 8GB of RAM, the OnePlus 5 allows all users to easily run the most powerful applications and eliminates all doubt in its ability to do so in the future,” the company told Digital Trends.. We initially reviewed the 8GB OnePlus 5, and concluded that it has. more speed, power, and ability than most people need. Since then we’ve spent time with the 6GB OnePlus 5 and found that under normal, everyday situations, it’s impossible to tell it has 2GB of RAM less. Games run in the same way, apps open at the same speed, and scrolling through Oxygen OS is an identical experience. The minute differences are only noticeable when the two sit side-by-side, and when dozens of apps are open. Even then, differences may come down to connection speed.. The whopping 8GB of RAM isn’t a reason to spend more money on the OnePlus 5. Having more storage space is, as the phone doesn’t have a MicroSD card slot — you’re stuck with what’s available. Having more space to store apps and media means your phone will stay useful for longer, and that’s worth the extra money. However, if you stream everything, and store all your photos in the cloud, then you won’t be left with a device that’s too slow if you opt for the cheaper 6GB model.. The OnePlus 5’s camera mimics the dual-camera setup on the iPhone. There are two Sony lenses on the back, a primary with 16 megapixels and a telephoto with 20 megapixels. These provide a 2× hybrid zoom system, and a bokeh-style Portrait mode — which is exactly what Apple calls it, and it even says “depth effect” when the feature is active, just like in iOS — for the desirable blurred background effect.. The excellent news is the main camera’s aperture is now rated at f/1.7, letting in 26 percent more light than the lens on the OnePlus 3T, plus auto-focus has been tweaked for a 40 percent speed increase. This joins improved HDR, and new features like a histogram, and a level-like reference line to ensure the horizon is straight. Annoyingly, this is only available in the camera’s Pro Mode.. Let’s talk about Portrait mode first. On release, the depth effect mode was slow to work. You had to stop and wait for the camera to focus on its subject and blur out the background, almost like the phone had to think about what it needed to do. the iPhone 7 Plus , where you adjust the distance between the camera and the subject until Depth Effect activates.. Since then OnePlus has updated the software several times, and the Portrait mode is considerably faster, and more effective. It grabs on to the subject very quickly and refuses to let go, even when you shift distances quickly. When you have captured a Portrait picture, the results are mostly excellent. The depth of field is highly accurate, with the OnePlus 5 picking out edges with greater accuracy than the iPhone in some situations. This is mainly due to it often taking a wider view, and not separating one small object like Apple’s software. Outside of Portrait mode, the OnePlus 5’s camera is relatively standard, meaning you get a panorama mode, slow motion video, a pro mode, and a couple of scenes.. Comparing shots with the iPhone 7 Plus reveals a massive difference between the way it handles color and contrast. The iPhone is adept at taking natural images, replicating what you see in the real world. The OnePlus 5 takes pictures like it’s on LSD. Colors and contrast are amplified to the max. It’s akin to Samsung’s philosophy of providing stunning, hyper-real pictures we want to share, regardless of whether that’s actually how the scene looked.. The OnePlus 5’s camera is going to divide opinion; but if you regularly use an HDR filter to augment your pictures, you’ll love it. But the overly saturated look means some colors and situations look weirdly “off.” A forest scene we photographed looked decidedly strange, for instance, as no trees produce such a bizarre shade of green.. OnePlus has added electronic image stabilization to the 4K video mode in a subsequent software update, and there is a noticeable difference when comparing them side-by-side. It’s certainly not the smoothest video you’ll shoot, but it’s better than nothing. Both cameras have electronic image stabilization for stills too.. The OnePlus 5 has a 3,300mAh battery inside, and it’s coupled with the company’s proprietary Dash Charge fast charging system. This is one of the best fast charging solutions available, and OnePlus promotes it as offering, “a day’s power in half an hour.” In reality, this means it charges the battery to about 60 percent capacity in 30 minutes, then on to a full charge in under 90 minutes.. This is one of the best proprietary fast chargers available, and OnePlus promotes it as offering, “a day’s power in half an hour.”. In our tests, the OnePlus 5 dropped to 50 percent by 10 p.m. with average use, so provided you’re not a really heavy user, the statement of getting a day’s use from 30 minutes charge should be accurate. The power of knowing how long it takes the fast charge system to top-up the battery shouldn’t be underestimated. Most of us will be able to plug the phone in after waking up in the morning, and categorically know it’ll have at least 60 percent charge ready for when we leave the house for work. It’s an extremely useful feature, and one that delivers on its promise.. Bluetooth 5.0 is onboard, providing more range for compatible connected gadgets, and more speed. The phone has a dual-SIM tray, but without space for a MicroSD card, so you’ll have to make do with the onboard storage. This is either 64GB or 128GB. The OnePlus 5 has 34 GSM bands for global connectivity, so it should provide the fastest connection wherever you are. OnePlus sells its phones unlocked without a contract through its own website. This is an excellent way to buy a device, as it gives you freedom to choose your network, when you can upgrade, or the option to sell the phone privately in the future. In the U.K., the O2 network will also offer the phone for sale with a variety of contracts.. The 64GB version comes in slate grey and with 6GB of RAM for $480, and is the cheapest way to buy the phone. Choose the $540 OnePlus 5 with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM and you have the choice of either slate grey or midnight black. The difference between the two is extremely subtle, and unless the light is just right, few will quickly tell them apart.. OnePlus has also released a limited edition soft gold OnePlus 5 , which has a gold body and a white front instead of a shade of black. It looks great, and catches the light in an attractive way. However, it’s only available with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage space, and costs the same at $480.. OnePlus has a one-year warranty on its devices in the United States, and broken phones will be repaired or replaced free of charge — that includes shipping and handling costs. It doesn’t cover daily wear and tear, or water damage. OnePlus also offers an extended warranty plan though Assurant Solutions called On-Guard for a year, 18 months, or two years. Because claims are dealt with in the U.S, it should be quicker. You’ll have to pay between $20 and $110 extra for the privilege.. The definition of flagship phone is changing. The most expensive phones have cutting-edge designs, virtual assistants, and complex, long feature lists that those who buy them only rarely use. Phones like the Galaxy S8 , the LG G6 , and Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus have become hyper phones. Expensive, luxurious, and generally a bit over-the-top.. The OnePlus 5 isn’t like them. It boils down the essence of the flagship phone to become leaner, meaner, and fiercer. It gives us the best processor, the most amount of RAM, a very capable (but divisive) camera, no-nonsense software, and a slick design for just $480. It could leave $200 in your pocket if you choose it over one of the aforementioned flagship smartphones. Who doesn’t want to save money without compromising?. While we’re singing the OnePlus 5’s praises, there are some other points to consider. Spec-fiends may prefer a 2,560 x 1,440 pixel resolution screen, music and video fans may want a MicroSD card slot, and others may simply not want a phone that looks like the iPhone. There’s also no waterproofing, which is becoming a standard feature in all high-end smartphones. They’re all valid points, but the benefits do outweigh the negatives here.. The OnePlus 5 stands apart at this price, and for this specification. Its main challenger comes from Honor, the sister brand to Huawei, with the Honor 8 and Honor 8 Pro. The Honor 8 Pro has a larger screen with a higher resolution, and Huawei’s high performance Kirin 960 processor inside, with a dual-lens camera on the back of the device. It costs 480 British pounds, but isn’t available in the United States.. In the U.S., the aging, smaller Honor 8 costs less and has a dual-lens camera, but the processor is older than the Honor 8 Pro’s Kirin 960, and the display isn’t the best around. If you’re also considering an iPhone, then budget restraints mean you’re limited to the iPhone SE. It’s a fine device, but doesn’t come close to matching the OnePlus 5.. Ignore the OnePlus 5’s low price, and we’d recommend the Google Pixel , which benefits from a superb camera, regular software updates, and a similarly excellent software and usability experience. But you’ll have to dig deep for one, as it costs $650.. Short of breaking the phone, or submerging it in water, the OnePlus 5’s lifespan will likely be two years at the minimum before you’d need to consider changing to a newer phone. It won’t stop working at this time, of course, and will continue to be an excellent everyday device beyond this.. The lack of water resistance is one of the phone’s biggest downsides. Even the iPhone has managed it, and it’s a shame the OnePlus 5 didn’t follow along. We do like the new carbon fiber silicone case that’s available, which adds plenty of impact protection, and makes the phone more comfortable and less slippery to hold. OnePlus does update the software on its phones, but not in such a timely fashion as Google does with the Pixel series. It has recently stopped offering software updates for the OnePlus 2, a phone released in mid-2015, so 2019 may end up being the end of support for the OnePlus 5. Our review phone had the May 1 Android security update installed, and this hasn’t changed since then, despite several over-the-air software updates.. The OnePlus 5 is almost fuss and frustration free, doesn’t overwhelm with pointless features, and saves you money over the competition.

OnePlus 5 review: Keep doing what you do best. OnePlus once again manages to straddle the line between quality and price, carving out a unique niche and executing perfectly.. Since the launch of the original OnePlus One , the company has been aggressively refining its strategy. With each subsequent release the goals got a bit less ambitious, the marketing became less ostentatious, and the phones consistently improved. At the same time, the idea of getting more phone for less money, without all of the extra cruft of a big company behind it, remained constant. The mid-2016 launch of the OnePlus 3 — and subsequent bump to the OnePlus 3T — best exemplified the company's maturity.. Despite rumors indicating that OnePlus would shift its strategy and go all-out with a more expensive, top-end phone in 2017, it has stuck with what has worked. The OnePlus 5 is a high-end phone that doesn't have a typical flagship price, but gives you the core experience you expect out of one and all of the specs to back it up. It is once again a perfect example of OnePlus executing on the model that it built its name on, refreshed and improved upon for 2017.. I (Andrew Martonik) am writing this review after 12 days using a Midnight Black OnePlus 5 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, operating on the AT&T network in the greater Seattle, WA area. The phone was updated once at the beginning of the review period to version 23_170603 on the May 1, 2017 security patch. The phone was provided to Android Central for review by OnePlus.. Our written review gets into all of the gritty details of the OnePlus 5, but if you want the concise version be sure to watch our full video review above. After you're done, read on and get all of the information you need in the complete review!. With the exception of the OnePlus X (RIP), none of the OnePlus phones have offered particularly striking or substantial hardware designs. Part of the value proposition of OnePlus phones, particularly in the 3 and 3T, was that you're giving up a bit on the design side in order to get a great spec sheet and fantastic overall experience — not unlike a Nexus or Pixel, you might say.. The story is the same again on the OnePlus 5, though I have to give it a bit more credit in design than its direct predecessor. Yes the OnePlus 5 looks very similar to the Oppo R11 , but that's basically irrelevant here — solid design is solid design, even if we've seen it before from an affiliated company.. I think the best word to describe the design progression of the OnePlus 5 is "sleek." Even though it's roughly the same dimensions as the OnePlus 3, it's smoother, more rounded and more friendly than that phone. The sharper edges, big bevels and squared-off look of the OnePlus 3 felt a bit more generic and not as welcoming, whereas the OnePlus 5's rounded features are subdued and classy — particularly in the Midnight Black finish, which is exclusive to the 8GB RAM / 128GB storage model. It all makes the phone a bit slippery to hold, though, with even less texture to the metal than the OnePlus 3 — this is a phone that will benefit from a thin OnePlus case if you're at all inclined to fumble your phone in your hand.. Simple, well-crafted materials with little excess flair.. Subtle design changes aside, this is the same basic hardware formula as before. We're looking at an anodized, barely-textured aluminum frame with 2.5D curved glass on the front flowing into the edges. It's a "standard" phone layout in that it's still a 5.5-inch 16:9 display with typical bezels and a fingerprint sensor underneath. All of the buttons are in the same spots — including the fantastic Alert Slider high on the left side — and all of the ports line up (literally, in an actual straight line) at the bottom.. OnePlus continues to ship phones with a distinct lack of extra flair — the entire back of the phone is blank and featureless save for a small shiny OnePlus logo and three cutouts for the cameras, microphone and flash. The antennas have been beautifully sculpted into the back of the phone and curved along the top and bottom to be less noticeable.. It isn't striking, and won't win any design awards, but the OnePlus 5 is a handsome phone that's built extremely well. The seams, finishes and execution of the design are on the same level as any other $650+ phone out there today, which is important if you're trying to convince people to buy this phone as a competitor to those in the next price bracket up.. A great little example of that improved quality is the vibration motor, which no longer rattles or gives a shallow feel but instead gives a full-phone force feedback as you'd expect from a top phone today. The one higher-end feature that's missing that you can't see is waterproofing; again despite rumors, OnePlus held off on an IP rating this year.. For me, the one area I'm disappointed to see remain constant on the OnePlus 5 is its display. This is the same 5.5-inch 1080p AMOLED panel as the OnePlus 3T, with improvements coming by way of new tuning (including a DCI-P3 calibration option) and Gorilla Glass 5 on top of it. The display remains solid, but unspectacular — colors are accurate, images are crisp enough and viewing angles are good. It gets bright, but not amazingly so like other leading displays out there — thankfully because it's AMOLED it has limited reflectivity in direct sunlight.. Seeing little improvement in the display a year on from the OnePlus 3 is disappointing.. I'm obviously not disappointed in the display itself, but at $479 (and up to $539) the OnePlus 5 is right on the line of where we would expect a QHD display — or, at the very least, a noticeable improvement in brightness or contrast while staying at 1080p. With so much staying the same or being predictable upgrades from the OnePlus 3, it's a reasonable expectation to see an upgrade in display quality here. The single down-firing speaker on the phone is super strong, and hits an acceptable volume for anything I'd need it for when it reaches about two-thirds volume. Things get a bit distorted at those high levels considering it's a single speaker, but as far as a single driver goes it passes the test of being more than competent. But don't go using the speaker all that often, okay? There's a headphone jack, too.. OnePlus 5 Software and experience. Gaming Do Not Disturb Mode : Block notifications and lock the navigation buttons while playing certain games (or any other app) to keep you in the zone. Customizable screen-off gestures : The typical OxygenOS gestures you can perform on your phone before the screen turns on — drawing an O, V, S, M or W — can now be customized to perform various actions or just open an app. Reading Mode : Automatically changes the screen temperature and calibration for reading, adjusted to the current environment. Can be toggled on and off, or on a per-app basis automatically. Auto Night Mode : The same Night Mode you know that reduces the blue light you see on the screen, now automatically toggled from sunset to sunrise based on your current location. Customizable vibration feedback : Choose your vibration pattern and intensity for calls, notifications and interface interaction. OnePlus sees no value in adding tons of extra or duplicative features to Android, and I love its approach. The core experience of using OxygenOS on a OnePlus phone is just Android — 7.1.1 Nougat, in this case. Everything works here like it does on a Google Pixel : the home screen, notifications, settings, and core features remain unchanged. The launcher itself has even taken a step closer to the Pixel's, with a semi-transparent dock that slides up to reveal an app drawer. The "Shelf" area to the left of the main home screen remains, though, as a place where you can basically see a scrolling list of widgets and information — I would prefer the Google Now feed here, but I can also just install the Google Now Launcher (at least for now).. So instead of changing the basic interface paradigm of Android, OnePlus continues to add value by giving you customization options and just a handful of neat features. Offering simple things like themes, a customizable status bar, new gestures and a couple tweaks throughout the interface all enhance the experience without taking away from Google's vision of Android in any way. Most importantly, you can ignore them entirely and just use the phone as it comes out of the box, too.. The experience you get here isn't far removed from a OnePlus 3 or 3T running Nougat, but there are a handful of new features that are worth highlighting:. Aside from what Google ships on its own Pixel and Nexus devices, the OxygenOS has to be my favorite "customization" of Android. Subtle tweaks like this continue to be useful, thoughtful and genuinely enjoyable — and unlike many other phones they don't come with a whole heap of other crap on the phone that I don't want.. As we've come to expect from OnePlus, performance on the OnePlus 5 is fantastic. Leading up to the phone's launch OnePlus talked a lot about speed, fluidity and consistency ... but I never had any issue on these points with the OnePlus 3T to begin with. The one place where there's a truly noticeable improvement is in touch response, which was a point of emphasis for OnePlus. However it ended up being accomplished, that super-tough-to-explain "feel" of high-quality touch response is definitely here. It's noticeable in scrolling and typing in particular, and I'm glad OnePlus stepped up its game here.. This is the type of consistent performance we want to see on every phone.. The OnePlus 5 is fantastically fast and smooth in everything I use a smartphone for, right on par with my experience using a Google Pixel XL for several months now. And based on how smooth my OnePlus 3 and 3T have been over time, I don't expect this experience to slow down in the future.. Of course I'm using the model with 8GB of RAM, but this really doesn't factor into the performance at this point. The highest average memory usage I ever reached, according to the phone's settings, is 4.7GB — comfortably underneath the 5.5GB ceiling (500MB is reserved for the system) of even the standard 6GB RAM model. You may decide that you "need" the 8GB of RAM model to future proof your phone purchase, or you may just get it for free because you need 128GB of storage, but I have to say 8GB of RAM really feels unnecessary on a phone today.. You could easily say that a Snapdragon 835 is overkill for a phone that's still running just a 1080p display, but we have to also remember the benefits of its power efficiency. OnePlus is counting on that efficiency to make up for the 100mAh reduction in battery size from the OnePlus 3T — and in the end 3300mAh is still a very industry-standard battery for a phone of this size, besting the Galaxy S8 and HTC U11 (which have the same processor) but matching the LG G6 and coming up just short of the Google Pixel XL (which have older processors).. Still a full-day battery for almost anyone, but with a tad less wiggle room than the OnePlus 3T.. Battery life has been strong, but not phenomenal, on the OnePlus 5. It's a little step up from the likes of the Galaxy S8 and HTC U11, getting me to bed with 20-25% battery left in the tank on most days. But I still had a couple of days during my review period where I was able to get down to 15%, enabling Battery Saver, just after dinnertime. Understanding that I'm using a phone with pre-release software I know there's probably some room for improvement, but interestingly it feels like battery life is perhaps a slight step down from the OnePlus 3T. Although it is a clear step up from the longevity provided by the OnePlus 3's 3000mAh battery and Snapdragon 820.. That means the OnePlus 5 is still easily a full-day phone for all but the heaviest of users, but it isn't going to give you any indication it's ready last any longer than that.. OnePlus is using the exact same 5V/4A proprietary Dash Charge quick charging standard on the OnePlus 5, and that's just fine because it's still super fast. It's backwards compatible to previous Dash Charge chargers you may have, but still has the lingering issue (if you could call it that) of having no compatibility with the more widely used Quick Charge 2.0/3.0/4.0 standard you'll find just about everywhere.. Considering the relatively pedestrian hardware and familiar software, it's understandable that OnePlus is putting marketing weight behind the camera setup on the OnePlus 5. As expected, OnePlus has made the move to dual cameras — and rather than going with a second monochrome sensor like Huawei has done recently or a wide-angle camera like LG, its second camera has a longer lens and higher resolution.. We lost OIS, but gained a whole second camera instead.. The primary camera is a new 16MP sensor behind a faster f/1.7 lens with improved auto focus speed when compared to the OnePlus 3, but has the same 1.12-micron pixel size and has lost OIS in the process. In exchange, you've gained a whole second camera sitting next to it: a 20MP sensor with 1-micron pixels and an f/2.6 aperture; its focal length is roughly 1.7-times the main camera. OnePlus is calling the longer lens "telephoto" but I'd argue that its ~40 mm focal length isn't quite long enough for that designation. (The iPhone 7 Plus, for example, has a focal length of 56 mm.). The camera samples you see below are a mix of the main camera, secondary camera and Portrait Mode shots that use both cameras together. I'm not breaking them out because switching between the three experiences is very fluid. Just like my time using the LG G6's dual cameras, I found myself constantly switching between the main and long lenses for different scenes or just to try and get a fresh look.. The main camera is a solid step up from the OnePlus 3 and 3T overall, managing to provide clear, sharp and colorful images even with small pixels and no OIS. In low light it relies on higher ISOs, though, leading to some grain and occasional blur when the shutter speed also has to be slowed down — it's in these situations that you miss having that physical stabilization. OnePlus still makes the right decision overall to leave some grain in the photos rather than aggressively over-sharpen images artificially, which never looks good.. This is an improvement from the OnePlus 3, but still short of the flagship competition.. The secondary camera is fun to use in good lighting, but that's it. With an f/2.6 aperture and 1-micron pixels it's not worth using in even mixed lighting conditions or most indoor shots — there's just too much noise and blur far too often. When the light is good, it has a similar color profile to the main camera, and the longer focal length and narrower aperture give its photos a distinct look.. Reviewing our first OnePlus 5 photos. The OnePlus 5's camera setup is perhaps its most interesting improvement from the OnePlus 3. With two cameras and new shooting modes, there's a lot to take in. For a more detailed look at our first OnePlus 5 photos — and our analysis of them — be sure to check out our camera review!. Reviewing our first OnePlus 5 photos — main, telephoto and Portrait Mode. Portrait Mode, which is the OnePlus take on what Huawei, Apple and others have been doing, effectively uses both cameras in unison to get depth information from a scene, calculate a plane at the focal distance you choose and then aggressively artificially blur the "background" behind that plane. The effect is naturally most dramatic in scenes with big, open backgrounds that would normally be in focus in a regular smartphone camera shot, but it can also work to great effect in macro shots with a very specific foreground item that the camera can easily identify.. Portrait Mode is fun and can offer stunning photos, but its processing is far from perfect.. On the downside, there are many situations in which you can see the software's limitations. A lot of my Portrait Mode shots came out soft overall, as if the camera wasn't able to figure out where edges of certain features were or couldn't decide what was near and far. The calculation involved with creating this artificial background blur is difficult, and OnePlus will no doubt improve it over time — even as-is it's good fun to switch to Portrait Mode and try a shot. I just tend to follow that up with a regular shot from one of the two cameras alone when possible.. Measuring the OnePlus 5 on its main camera alone, it's a capable shooter that improves from last year but also doesn't perfectly match up to the top-end flagships out there today that can offer better, more consistent performance in a variety of shooting conditions. The secondary camera gives a small bump to the OnePlus 5's overall camera experience, enabling new shooting options and a fun-to-play-with Portrait Mode, but it really doesn't seem like adding this second camera was worth losing OIS (and perhaps larger pixels) and the potential for better photos out of the main camera.. Keep doing what you do best. There are several solid improvements in the OnePlus 5 worth mentioning, but the most standout aspect of the phone is its value. Just like the models preceding it, the OnePlus 5 gives you a near-flagship experience for $150-250 less than the competition. It does so by walking the line between putting money into the aspects that matter, while keeping costs low in other areas without making the phone feel cheap or substantially lacking.. OnePlus knows exactly how to deliver a high-end phone that also feels like a great value.. You're getting a jam-packed and future-proof spec sheet, an above-average display, solid speaker, good battery life, fast charging and a well-built aluminum body. The software is slick, fast and consistent in ways that few phones can match, and doesn't include piles of features that get in your way. That combination is only going to set you back $479 — that's precisely what OnePlus is known for.. So what, then, are you missing out on by not going with the pricier competition? You're not getting groundbreaking hardware design, nor a top-notch display or waterproofing. The camera experience is good, but a step below the top-end cameras today. Those are just a few trade-offs, and ones that most people would happily take to save $200 on their phone purchase. And that's before you factor in the ways in which the OnePlus 5 actually beats the flagships from Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola and others.. Once again, OnePlus has delivered a phone that manages to offer a high-end experience, while also feeling like a great value for the money. The OnePlus 5 may have only brought predictable upgrades from its predecessor, but that's more than enough to make this a great phone and a great buy for so many people..

OnePlus 5 review: Making the leap from good to great. It's a powerhouse with a modest price tag.. We've been following OnePlus and its journey to build a better flagship phone for years. Along the way, it managed a feat that's difficult for even the biggest conglomerates: The company kept outdoing itself. I don't mean to spoil the fun here, but the team has done it again with the OnePlus 5. Really, what's most striking is just how much this tiny company managed to get right in a phone that costs less than $550 (more on that later). It might not have every single whiz-bang feature that you'll find in other flagship smartphones, but the thoughtful balance of style, power and price make it a star.. Design is starting to feel generic. Dash charging is a closed standard. Building a great phone is hard enough, so building a great phone on a budget should be infinitely more difficult. With its fifth flagship, OnePlus makes it look easy. The OnePlus blazingly fast, with a surprisingly good dual camera and solid battery life. OxygenOS is a refreshingly light take on Android, too, and the phone's build quality seems top-notch. It's too bad that OnePlus's designs seem to be getting more generic as time goes on, and that the phone's screen doesn't pack the same punch as its competitors. Ultimately, despite some compromises, the OnePlus is both an excellent phone and an excellent value.. Before we go any further, a few notes: We're reviewing the top-of-the-line OnePlus 5, with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (available only in black). This model will set you back $540, but that's still highly reasonable for the specs you get. Fortunately, there's also a version with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage (available only in gray) — that'll set you back $480, and should still give every other flagship a run for its money.. Both versions of the phone are identical otherwise, from the Snapdragon 835 chipsets they share to their sealed, 3,300mAh batteries. (Yes, that's just a hair smaller than the battery we got in the 3T. ) For better or worse, though, OnePlus still prefers giving its phones two nanoSIM slots instead of a spot for a SIM and a microSD card. While this flexibility (and support for loads of GSM and LTE bands) make OnePlus 5 an excellent travel device, you're better off getting the more expensive mode if you can afford it.. Gallery: OnePlus 5 review | 23 Photos. All of those components are wrapped in a sleek, anodized aluminum body that, yeah, kind of looks like an iPhone. Some of the cosmetic touches are similar, like the placement of the fingerprint sensor and the dual-camera. More bothersome is how the classic OnePlus design language has matured to a point where it's starting to feel a little generic. The original OnePlus One was an unmistakable device — you just can't say the same about the OnePlus 5.. None of that takes away from how well-built this phone is, though. It's the thinnest flagship the startup has made, and at 153g, it's a just a bit lighter than the phone it replaces. All the usual OnePlus touches apply, too. High on the OP5's right side is a handy textured notification slider that lets you quickly jump between notification levels like Priority (where only some people get through) and Do Not Disturb.. Meanwhile, you'll find capacitive keys on either side of the fingerprint-sensing home button that act as the Back and Recent buttons. You can swap their order or, if you're like me and accidentally hit them all the time with your hand-meat, ditch 'em in favor of some on-screen keys instead. It's this kind of flexibility that keeps OnePlus fans coming back for more.. This year, we're working with another 5.5-inch AMOLED panel running at 1080p, with a traditional 16:9 aspect ratio and no curves. (It is, however, covered in a slightly curved plate of Gorilla Glass 5 that's already getting dinged up.) While I would've loved to see OnePlus embrace the no-bezel look that its rivals have, it's pretty clear why it hasn't: It'd be a financial nightmare. Personally, I'm just fine with the compromise OnePlus made here.. It might not be quite as crisp as the Galaxy S8's screen but the pixel density on this 5.5-inch, 1080p screen works out to 401 PPI. During my testing, that's been more than enough for nitpicking details in photos and reading very small text. Brightness was also sufficient — I took the phone for several long walks and had no trouble seeing directions.. The fact that we're getting a no-nonsense screen doesn't mean we're not getting any frills. After user feedback, OnePlus added an sRGB color mode to the 3 via software update — this time the team added support for the DCI-P3 color gamut, a move Apple embraced in its most recent iPhones. These are nice perks for display junkies, but most people will never touch these settings — the punchy default mode is already very pleasant. In fact, my only real complaint is that you'll see some mild color distortion if you look at the screen from a very oblique angle. That's less a problem for you than for the person snooping on your texts from the seat next to you.. Meanwhile, the speaker situation hasn't changed much: There's still a single grille drilled into the phone's bottom edge, and it's a little louder than the 3T at maximum volume. I've mostly used the OnePlus to blast music and podcasts for a week, and both came out sounding bright if a little muddy at high volume. As always, you'll want to turn to headphones for the best possible audio quality. On the flip side, OnePlus baked three microphones into the phone for improved audio recording, and the difference was clear. I recorded a room full of chattering family members on Father's Day, and the 5 produced clearer, cleaner sound than the 3T.. As always, the OnePlus 5 runs a custom version of Android called OxygenOS (version 4.5 now). Think of it as "stock Android plus" — it's built atop a clean version of Android 7.1.1 Nougat and loaded with a host of helpful tweaks and options to give power users more control. You can, launch apps by drawing symbols on the screen or swipe into a "shelf" to the left of your home screen to quickly check the weather and leave yourself memos. Want to switch to a dark theme or inject some pink highlights into the interface like I did? Done and done.. The settings app is rife with modifications that both expand Android's usefulness and make it feel more personal, but all of this stuff is hidden under the surface. If you just want a smooth Android experience, you could very easily ignore it all. These broad strokes will be all too familiar to OnePlus fans, but there are plenty of new touches as well.. There's a Do Not Disturb mode specifically for gaming, which automatically blocks notifications from rolling in when you're midmatch. More useful for me was a reading mode that makes the screen go gray scale when you launch certain apps — say, Amazon's Kindle or The New York Times. It's certainly easier on the eyes, but I'm never going to give up my e-reader. There's also a "secure box" for storing sensitive files and apps from prying eyes ( a la Samsung), which is always more useful than people are generally willing to admit. Beyond that, most of the changes are pretty subtle -- you can customize how the phone vibrates more specifically and night mode can be set to automatically activate with the sunset.. Curiously, my OnePlus 5 was supposed to have Google's Assistant preloaded — emphasis on "supposed to." I've since been able to confirm that the Assistant works as well as expected on other OnePlus 5s, so hopefully, this is just a rare mistake that users will never have to deal with.. Dual cameras in smartphones may have seemed like a flash in the pan at first, but it's clear they're not going anywhere except in our pockets. Most of the time you'll be using the 16-megapixel main camera, which stacks up well against devices like Samsung's Galaxy S8. Photos taken with the OnePlus 5 were generally a little darker and less saturated than their S8 counterparts, but the sensor's higher resolution kept things crisp and occasionally captured details Samsung's might have missed.. It's also very quick to focus thanks to the way Sony has arranged the focus pixels on the sensor — long story short, you're probably not going to miss the moment unless your reflexes suck. The camera also has an f/1.7 aperture, which made shots taken in dim conditions come out brighter than expected, though grain became an issue when lighting was anything less than optimal. As light grew more scarce, edges softened and textures became more indistinct.. Having another, separate 20-megapixel telephoto camera to switch into is very helpful, and it's a pleasant surprise to see OnePlus use a higher-resolution sensor for the zoom camera. (The G6, for example, uses a pair of 13-megapixel sensors.) Color saturation and detail seemed slightly better here as well, to the point where I sometimes preferred shooting in 2x mode. Thankfully, switching between the two takes a single tap, while a sideways slide brings the zoom level as high as 8x.. Gallery: OnePlus 5 camera samples | 16 Photos. Both of these cameras are used for the depth-effect mode, which adds a bunch of bokeh behind your subject. It's a crowd-pleaser, albeit a finicky one. You have to maintain the right distance from your subject and have enough light for the software to do its thing. The resulting shots are generally very good, and I've come to appreciate OnePlus's approach over the iPhone 7 Plus because it works surprisingly well on things besides faces. Beyond all that is a fairly spartan app for actually shooting these photos, which is just fine by me. There's no cruft here — the only other truly neat feature is a handy Pro mode, complete with a histogram to help experienced photographers expose their photos correctly.. And what of the 16-megapixel front-facing camera? Well, selfies came out very crisp, and the new screen flash makes it easier to capture your duck-face in a dimly lit bar. While I'd still give the photographic crown to Google's Pixel , OnePlus should be proud of its work. It's not perfect, but the dual camera here is well executed and raises the bar for a company that has struggled to get photography right..

There was never any question that phone with specs like this would run well, but the OnePlus 5's performance took even me by surprise. I spent the past week as I always do — using the phone as my daily work multitasking machine, and then mixing things up with shootouts in Afterpulse or agonizing decisions in Telltale Games' Guardians of the Galaxy. Not once did I see the phone flinch, stutter or even drop a frame — it was almost weird how effortlessly the OnePlus 5 seemed to handle everything I threw at it. Based on my experience and the big, big numbers the phone put up in our suite of synthetic benchmarks, I have no doubt that this more expensive version of the OnePlus 5 will be overkill for most people.. Don't get me wrong: Other flagship phones look and feel better, and pack so many exciting-sounding features that I'm surprised their marketing teams can keep up. Few other phones to date have felt this smooth, and hardly any have been able to offer up this level of performance. This, in short, is wild stuff for $540.. The flip side to all this is that the OnePlus 5 actually has a slightly smaller battery than the model it replaces. OnePlus says that the sealed 3,300mAh battery is capable of lasting around 20 percent longer than last year's 3T, but I wasn't able to replicate those claims. That doesn't mean the battery sucks. In our standard rundown test, where we loop an HD video with Wi-Fi on and screen brightness set to half, the OnePlus 5 stuck around for fifteen hours and three minutes — that's better than any other flagship phone I've tested this year, but roughly an hour short of the bar set by the 3T in 2016.. The OP5 fares better in daily use, though: while the OnePlus 3T generally lasted for just over a day on a single charge, the 5 routinely withstood a day and a half of mixed use. It doesn't take much to get that up to two days — the battery saver mode is off by default, after all — but the included Dash charger means you can go a long way on a momentary recharge. When I forgot to plug in the phone overnight, a 15-minute top-up was enough to last me most of a day. Just try (hard) not to lose the cable or the charger, because you'll need both to charge as quickly as possible.. On one end of the price spectrum are the flagship contenders, like the Galaxy S8, S8 Plus and LG's G6. The base level Galaxy S8 costs about $100 more than this particular OnePlus 5, and it's an absolutely gorgeous device. While you get a drool-worthy screen, you'd have to put up with loads of Samsung-mandated apps that you may not want.. The G6 is similarly laden with LG software you probably don't want, but its own dual camera setup offers more flexibility and media creation features. At $599, the unlocked G6 is still more expensive than the high-end OnePlus 5 and runs with a pokier chipset to boot. The price comparisons hurt when you look at iPhones, too. An iPhone 7 Plus with its dual camera and 128GB of storage costs $869 unlocked.. If you're on a budget and looking for a great device in the same ballpark, there's always the Moto Z2 Play. In our initial testing, it proved to be an excellent modular midrange option with a lovely sense of style. That said, it costs $499 unlocked and offers a fraction of the power the OnePlus 5 does.. I've been using a Galaxy S8 as my daily driver since I started reviewing it, and I thought it was going to stay in my rotation indefinitely. Well, sorry, Samsung — I don't think I'm going to put the OnePlus 5 down anytime soon. The company built a phone that's very, very hard to dislike. It's blazingly fast, has a surprisingly good camera and excellent battery life. Its version of Android is surprisingly clean, and the price tag means true flagship power won't destroy your wallet.. But building a phone like this is always an exercise in compromise, and the balance that OnePlus struck among form, functionality and price is incredible. Whether this means OnePlus becomes a household name remains to be seen. For now though, it's, clear that anyone looking for a high-powered smartphone should have the OnePlus 5 on her shortlist.. android , applenews , flagship , gear , mobile , oneplus , oneplus5 , oxygen , oxygenos , review , smartphone.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. by Victor Hristov. Android - Android + OnePlus - OnePlus +. 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction The new OnePlus 5 is an evolution of a successful formula: it adds a dual camera with Portrait mode and the fastest Android chip around… The OnePlus 5 is the newest phone by OnePlus, a company that in just three years has fought its way to become one of the recognizable names among flagship makers. It did so by word of mouth and a large group of dedicated fans, standing by its ‘never settle’ motto. Oh yes, and by making flagship-grade phones with top specs at affordable prices. The OnePlus 5, however, is its most expensive phone, and it’s got an iPhone inspired look and even a similar dual camera on the back. It is the company’s best and the company’s most controversial phone. Also, it’s the only one it makes, OnePlus’ all-or-nothing bet. How has it worked out? We have been living with the OnePlus 5 for a while and we’re eager to share our experience. In the box: Wall charger (5V - 4A) USB-C to USB cable User manual Sim ejector Design Beautiful and stylish? Check! Not so much an iPhone once you get to actually use it. Also, alarmingly slippery and lacks water protection. You have probably seen the pictures: the back of the OnePlus 5 next to the back of the iPhone 7 Plus , all looking pretty much exactly the same. Yes, the resemblance is there and it’s hard to deny where OnePlus draws inspiration from, but once you hold the new OnePlus 5 in your hand you notice that there is far less similarity than those pictures might have convinced you of. The curved back, the accent line around the edges and a few other details make the OnePlus 5 actually feel noticeably different than the iPhone 7 Plus. Curious fact: Yet still, the OnePlus 5 does not feel fully an original design. It’s no secret that OnePlus is owned by Chinese giant BBK Electronics, which also owns Oppo and Vivo, two very popular brands in China. And the OnePlus 5 is basically a mixture of those two companies’ flagships. If you live in the US and Europe, you probably have not heard about the Vivo X9 and the Oppo R9s , but if you want to see the OnePlus 5’s ‘mother and father’, just take a look at those two phones. The Vivo X9 is nearly a carbon copy of the OnePlus 5’s design, while the Oppo R9s uses basically the same dual camera setup and fast charging. After you look up those two phones, you will start seeing the OnePlus 5 as a bit of a Frankenstein phone. Now that we have addressed this, let’s say that the OnePlus 5 is a 5.5-inch phone with a 9:16 display, and for its form factor it is a narrow phone that is comfortable to hold, but still definitely far from being single-hand friendly like the new breed of narrow phones with a tall display like the Galaxy S8. The back is curved and an already thin phone becomes even thinner at the edges, which contributes a lot to its ergonomics. Yet, it’s also devilishly slippery, tending to slip out of your pocket easily and while I haven’t dropped it yet, I feel like this is more of an inevitability with the OnePlus 5 than with other phones. Up front, you have a slightly larger than on earlier OnePlus phones physical home key. That’s also where the fingerprint scanner is. It definitely feels like one of the fastest finger scanners around, it’s nearly instantaneous, impressively zippy. OnePlus has also gotten the little things right with the ‘5’: the side buttons are made of metal, clicky and easy to press, with nice travel to them. The 3-way mute key on the left has a textured surface, so you can easily find it by touch, without even looking at the phone. The USB-C is properly centered (but still limited to only USB 2.0 speeds), and there’s a 3.5mm audio jack. There are two big features missing: the OnePlus 5 does not have any special water protection and it does not support wireless charging. OnePlus CEO says water proofing just makes phones thicker and heavier, and adds he’s not convinced it’s ‘a big consumer requirement’. Big or not, we find it a nice convenience and feel the OnePlus 5 would have been an even better phone if it had water protection. Display 5.5” AMOLED display with a 1080 x 1920-pixel resolution. The OnePlus 5 features a 5.5-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels. The specs-obsessed will be quick to point out that it’s not a Quad HD (1440 x 2560 pixel) display, meaning that it’s less sharp than other 5.5” phones like the Google Pixel XL and the HTC U11. In reality, though, it’s almost impossible to notice the difference in sharpness. For most everyone, the resolution of the OnePlus 5 is more than sufficient and the phone looks sharp enough. Color defaults to a punchy mode that most users really dig. Everything looks very vivid in this mode, very contrasty, but also somewhat bluish. OnePlus also includes two ‘pro’ color modes. First, you have the option switch to sRGB colors, where sRGB is the color standard that most cameras these days default to and most content is optimized for. Colors in sRGB look less saturated on the OnePlus 5 and a bit dull compared to the defaults. The bigger issue here is that whites appear a bit too green, so we cannot fully recommend using this option. The OnePlus 5 display also has a new DCI-P3 color option. This is a newly implemented color standard on phones, one that the iPhone 7 supports as well. Colors here are slightly more saturated, wider than sRGB, but we again notice that whites tend to appear greenish. So at the end of the day, we stick to the default color mode on the OnePlus 5, which might not be the most accurate, but we find the most pleasing. You can find more details in the charts right below. In terms of brightness, this is not the brightest one out there. This is an issue when you use the phone outdoors, especially now in summertime when the sun is bright -- it’s hard to see what’s on the screen. We should also note that the screen is now protected by Gorilla Glass 5 on the OnePlus 5, which is more durable than on earlier OnePlus phones. 6.07 x 2.92 x 0.29 inches. 154.2 x 74.1 x 7.25 mm. 6.23 x 3.07 x 0.29 inches. 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm. 6.28 x 2.89 x 0.32 inches. 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1 mm. 5.86 x 2.83 x 0.31 inches. 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm.

Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. More content with 5. Apple iPhone 8 Plus vs OnePlus 5.

So same level as the HTC U11. posted on 27 Jun 2017, 10:18. At least it scored higher than One Plus 2..... (Posts: 1728; Member since: 30 Jul 2013). posted on 27 Jun 2017, 10:21. So let me get this straight. U11 gets 8.2 because of an EXTRA software gimmick is not easy to learn, and yes that was one of the cons. OPO5 a phone with great specs, the smoothest fastest android phone, with great camera, 200-300$ cheaper than most flagships also gets 8.2. But an iPhone SE gets 8.8 even though when it came out it had LITERALLY the same design, same screen, same battery as a 4 year old iPhone 5 with just new cpu, gpu and better camera. Can you IMAGINE the s**t OPO or HTC would get if they did that? Just imagine OPO made a new phone with OPO1 design, same screen and just added new cpu, camera etc and priced it 500$. (Posts: 136; Member since: 07 Jun 2017). posted on 27 Jun 2017, 11:53. It is also no more than $100ish cheaper than most flagships these days. You can get the U11 right now for $599. LG G6 unlocked version on BH photo is $549. Then there are plenty of deals that give you other flagships for less eg the S8 with a trade in of a $5 phone for $425. Brand new G6s on ebay go for $400 for lots of different versions. Lots of people selling them off from carrier bogo deals or $10 a month deals etc. The SE is significantly better than the iphone 5. I wish oneplus had done that with the 3T-5. Upgrade the camera, upgrade the processor and battery. (Posts: 2; Member since: 24 Aug 2017). posted on 24 Aug 2017, 21:00. If oneplus 5 camera is mediocre, iphone 7 has a poor camera. Search for this video on youtube: OnePlus 5 4K EIS Video Update Test (vs iPhone 7 Plus & Galaxy S8). (Posts: 14967; Member since: 25 Sep 2013). posted on 27 Jun 2017, 12:02. What? The camera on the 1+5 is worse than the iPhone 7. Nother beats the S7 or S8's camera at all. Smooth? At doing what? Nothing?! Liek the iPhone?. The camera has software OIS and it sucks. side by side videos show the camera is worse than the iPhone 7's. Is it possible to get high off ignorance? Because so many guys here are so high off their own stupidity.. (Posts: 2305; Member since: 11 Sep 2014). posted on 28 Jun 2017, 00:44. (Posts: 1092; Member since: 16 Jul 2016). posted on 02 Jul 2017, 09:07. Camera is pretty good, I'd take it over the iPhone 7 camera. But clearly the android flagships are in different league, OnePlus 5 is a good phone but overpriced.. (Posts: 2; Member since: 24 Aug 2017). posted on 24 Aug 2017, 20:59. Worse than iphone 7 ?? Are you sure??. Search for this video on youtube: OnePlus 5 4K EIS Video Update Test (vs iPhone 7 Plus & Galaxy S8). Iphone 7 has a mediocre camera for the price.. (Posts: 3; Member since: 06 May 2016). posted on 27 Jun 2017, 20:54. Phonearena should rethink about their review system. Rating iPhone SE 8.8 which has same 5s design small battery, OK camera and smallest battery. You people are definitely paid or give biased reviews.. (Posts: 1485; Member since: 18 Mar 2012). posted on 27 Jun 2017, 10:43. I dont think the OP5 looks or feels like an iPhone aside from the camera. I think that was a stupid decision in OP part. They should draw a line a distance themselves. They need to make a name for their own products outside of China. A slightly different camera bezel and position of the flash would help.. (Posts: 382; Member since: 15 Nov 2013). posted on 27 Jun 2017, 11:07. Cheating in camera, cheating in benchmarks, no waterproof, no OIS. (Posts: 4108; Member since: 05 Apr 2013). posted on 27 Jun 2017, 11:17. where did they cheat in the camera department?. (Posts: 306; Member since: 04 May 2017). posted on 27 Jun 2017, 16:10. Optical.zoom is not 2x, just 1.6x. (Posts: 4108; Member since: 05 Apr 2013). posted on 27 Jun 2017, 16:17. in response to #40 Hide. True but they never claimed it was 2x optical zoom.. (Posts: 59; Member since: 04 Aug 2015). posted on 27 Jun 2017, 16:23. in response to #40 Hide. OnePlus never claimed 2x optical zoom, that's the bull that all the reviewers are claiming the OP5 is capable of due to their own excitement about the camera similarities to the iPhone 7 Plus. The OnePlus 5 has 1.6x pure optical zoom, but is capable of producing 2x of maximum optical zoom by way of Smart capture MultiFrame Technology; look it up. So technically the OnePlus 5 has 2x lossless zoom, not optical. The benchmark thing is something that while I wouldn't call it cheating, I'd call it wrong and without purpose. Google has warned against this being done by OEMs and OnePlus still chose to do it anyway. There is no waterproofing on this device because of the savings in manufacturing costs. The OnePlus 5 is already more expensive than an iPhone to manufacture and is the same or similar in manufacturing costs to other devices on the market that sell in the $600 range. So, OnePlus is already operating on thinner profit margins than others; waterproofing the device would make OnePlus have to up the actual release price by enough to where there isn't a distinct difference between its price and other devices' price.. (Posts: 306; Member since: 04 May 2017). posted on 27 Jun 2017, 11:14. No IP against dust nor water. Photos do not look better than 2015 flagships. No 4K stabilization ( wil be added later). Still got same score of U11?. (Posts: 2293; Member since: 31 Oct 2011). posted on 27 Jun 2017, 12:25. In Canada, the U11 is $250 more than the OnePlus 5. It's almost like that extra money buys you some things that the other handset doesn't have. Do you want to spend the money for the extras, or do you want to save the money and do without?.

Remember the "stereo" speakers of the OnePlus one that was a twin MONO? The "we are just a startup", owned by Oppo and on and on..

This and the U11 scored 8.2 despite the U11 got a high end camera and one of the best available, superior audio quality, better hardware in general, superb software and fast updates from HTC, and an innovative squeeze feature.

One plus 5 deserves at least 8.8. if not a 9 alone for what one plus has achieved in the price range and still packing 8 GB ram and 128 GB storage camera isn't perfect but good in my eyes design is great software is the best one out there full stop. Same for the HTC bloody great phone does everything better that the iPhone does so why only an 8.2 seriously pathetic. Apart from the bezel the phone is one of the most complete devices this year.

CNET también está disponible en español.. OnePlus 5: Everything we know so far. Can OnePlus wow us again? Here are all the rumored specs of the maverick Chinese phone maker's next flagship device.. by June 15, 2017 10:28 AM PDT. Specs rumored for the OnePlus 5: 5.5-inch display with 2,560x1,440-pixel or 1,920x1,080 resolution Dual rear cameras (confirmed) with 20-megapixel and 16-megapixel sensors 8-megapixel front camera Available in black, red, gold and " unicorn " (confirmed) Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor (confirmed) 6GB or 8GB of RAM and up to 128GB of storage "Ceramic-coated" fingerprint scanner Refined microphone technology 4G LTE multimode modem 3,600mAh or 3,300mAh battery OxygenOS based on Android Starting somewhere between $449 (roughly £350 or AU$600) and $479 Launching June 20, 2017. Will the real OnePlus 5 please stand up? Serious hardware. Dual lens and mega-megapixels Going full unicorn. Tecnoblog has published a photo of what it says is the OnePlus 5.. The OnePlus family is about to get a plus-1. The Chinese phone maker has announced that it will introduce its newest phone, the OnePlus 5, on Tuesday, June 20. And the more we learn more about it, the more it seems like the next OnePlus phone could defy expectations. For one thing, we're skipping right over the OnePlus 4 -- it's an unlucky number in China -- and going straight to 5. For another, the company will offer the phone in a variety of colors including... " unicorn ." And, finally, according to the rumors, OnePlus may seriously raise the stakes for camera technology.. It's official: the OnePlus 5 drops on June 20.. The company has made a name for itself by making high-quality phones with the latest hardware at a price point well below what Samsung and Apple typically charge. CNET called the OnePlus 3 "the best budget Android phone you can buy.". OnePlus loves to leak its own news. posted a teaser picture on Weibo. to announce that a new phone was in the works, the company has been dribbling out hints of what's to come. Taking a page from Apple's playbook -- and doing the exact opposite -- OnePlus seems to be both reveling in the speculation around the 5 and fueling it, tweeting out clues on an almost daily basis.. Though nothing that the company has confirmed so far is mind-blowing, the steady stream of rumors is fueling speculation and ramping up expectations. We're collecting the most promising official and semiofficial rumors below.. OnePlus will unveil the new phone at a live online launch at 12 p.m. ET on Tuesday, June 20, to be followed by a series of "pop-up events" hosted in retail locations in the US and Europe. Early reports by the Verge and. that the phone would debut this summer were followed by speculation on phone nerd sites, which included purported. event posters , that the reveal would come on June 15.. This image, published by Android Police, resembles those released by OnePlus, though there are some differences.. More images show up every day. Are they real? Are they fake? We don't know -- OnePlus has declined to comment on their authenticity.. In May, Android Authority posted a photo of phone that looked awfully similar to the OnePlus 3T -- albeit with a vertical dual camera array -- that the site claimed was a OnePlus 5 prototype. More recently, Android Police published a different design with two rear cameras, that looks similar -- though not exactly the same -- to an image subsequently released by OnePlus. And this week, Portuguese site Tecnoblog posted what appears to be the full-size version of the Android Police image -- in addition to a number of detailed specifications. posted the "full device specification," which include a "ceramic-coated" fingerprint reader, 3,300mAh battery, 6 or 8GB of RAM and 64 or 128GB of storage. Oppomart , which has a mixed track record of predicting specs, published a list of possible components including 6GB of RAM, 64GB or 128GB of storage capacity, a fingerprint scanner and OnePlus's Android variant, OxygenOS.. We know for sure that the OnePlus 5 will have a Snapdragon 835 processor, because Qualcomm said so, and so did OnePlus CEO. It's Qualcomm's fastest chipset, which also powers the. That means that the OnePlus 5 could be thinner than its current flagship phone, the. -- which kicked serious butt in our benchmark tests -- and deliver longer battery life and faster speeds when you navigate around and edit photos and video.. We've known that the OnePlus 5 will feature dual rear cameras since the company's June 5. But Tecnoblog adds a potentially blockbuster detail, reporting that the cameras will feature 20-megapixel and 16-megapixel sensors. If accurate, the OnePlus 5 would ostensibly blow away both the iPhone 7 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S8 on photos and video.. Oppomart 's list of specs includes two 12-megapixel Sony camera sensors, which would still make the OnePlus 5 a serious contender on the photo/video front. Either way, the move to a dual-lens array gives OnePlus an opportunity to leapfrog competitors like Samsung, whose Galaxy S8 has just one rear camera.. In May, OnePlus announced a partnership with DxO , a photography software and accessories shop. The nature of the partnership remains unclear beyond a promise to "enhance your photography experience.". OnePlus has invited its 1 million Twitter followers to pick the color of the OnePlus 5. In a May tweet, the company offered up options such as black, red, gold and a green/blue/purple gradient that the company later referred to as " unicorn .". — OnePlus (@oneplus) May 22, 2017.

OnePlus has posted a short video showing what appears to be adjustable color temperature controls, captioned "Get a taste of how we've refreshed OxygenOS." It looks. like the True Tone technology Apple debuted with the iPad Pro last year, with sensors that measure ambient light color and brightness connected to a display that can adjust accordingly.. — OnePlus (@oneplus) June 15, 2017. Get a taste of how we've refreshed OxygenOS 😉 pic.twitter.com/JNAKJWiucw. OnePlus cofounder Carl Pei has written a blog post about the 5's improved audio capabilities. As proof of the improved performance, the company has published a video comparing the 3T and 5 in a loud nightclub. Oppomart lists the price as $449 (approximately £350 or AU$600) and gives an estimated ship date of early June -- so take it all with a plus-sized grain of salt. But the OnePlus 3 and 3T combined premium design, features and performance with an accessible price tag, and we expect a similar deal from the OnePlus 5..

OnePlus 5 Review: Not The Flagship Killer You Were Hoping For It’s been a hit-and-miss affair for OnePlus so far. Its first smartphone, aptly named OnePlus One , was a great device for its price, but the company couldn’t make enough phones to match the unexpected demand. Its second phone was riddled with various hardware and software issues, while the OnePlus X defeated the company’s motto. Last year, the company made two exceptional devices – OnePlus 3 ( review ) and OnePlus 3T ( review ) – and were more or less flagship killers. The company is now back with a new phone, the OnePlus 5. The company claims that apart from offering great specifications and quality at comparatively lower prices, it offers something extra: a great camera that can match the likes of the iPhone 7 Plus and the Galaxy S8. So, does the OnePlus 5 deliver? Let’s find out in our review. Continuing with the OnePlus 3 and 3T’s metal unibody build, the company has improved on the design of its latest smartphone. The phone is slightly slimmer and narrower, but it feels less slippery, comparatively. Yes, the OnePlus 5’s design looks quite similar to that of the iPhone 7 Plus in the press images, including its rear-facing camera setup and antenna lines, but it feels quite different when you actually use it. It feels better than the iPhone 7 Plus, because it is much shorter and narrower, and its sharper edges offer a better grip. The LG G6, which now costs lower than the OnePlus 5, has better primary camera, a bezel-less screen, sturdier design, dust and water resistance, and more software features. Let alone offering things like stereo speakers or an HDR-capable display. Is the OnePlus 5 a flagship killer? I don’t think so. I would say that it’s a very good phone, but it can’t offer a better value proposition than the OnePlus 3T, let alone compete with flagship phones from Apple, LG, HTC, or Samsung. It’s not a flagship killer this year. We hope a better show from the OnePlus 5T , which will be released soon. Decent camera and Portrait Mode is useful 4. Bloat-free, fast, and clean software 5. Camera is not much of an improvement over the OnePlus 3/3T 2. No improvement in front-facing camera 3. OnePlus 5 Review: What’s In The Box. The OnePlus 5 comes bundled with Dash Charge-compatible wall charging unit and a good-quality USB Type-A to USB Type-C cable, both painted in the company’s white-and-red colour combination. The review unit also came bundled with four cases, but they won’t be included with retail units. You’ll have to buy those separately from the company’s website. If you were hoping for bundled earphones with the OnePlus 5, you’re out of luck.. The single loudspeaker gets muffled when you watch videos in the landscape mode, though. However the USB Type-C port, headphone jack, power button, and volume rocker are placed at ideal positions. Also, I still love the three-way sound profile switch on the OnePlus 5. You can just flip the switch to put the phone into mute mode. It’s a much easier way than unlocking the device and pressing the volume button all the way down till it goes into the vibrate only mode. I think every Android phone maker should start incorporating a dedicated mute switch into their devices.. The OnePlus 5’s 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display (or Optic AMOLED as OnePlus calls it) is the exact same Samsung-made OLED panel that was used in the OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus 3T last year, so it is similarly bright and colourful. Don’t expect it to be better than the OnePlus 3 or 3T in any regard. Touch accuracy and sensitivity is very good, and you can see all the content on the display quite effortlessly, unless it’s a very sunny day.. Coming to extra features of the OnePlus 5’s display, there’s Night Mode and Reading Mode. The Night Mode turns the screen’s colour tone warmer, making it easier on the eyes. You can configure it to activate and deactivate based on sunrise and sunset times, or configure it your own way. Reading Mode is a special way to turn the screen greyscale, making it look like an e-book reader’s e-ink screen. If you’re reading long-form articles, you should consider using this mode.. The OnePlus 5’s whole marketing has revolved around its new camera. Unlike the OnePlus 3 and 3T’s single 16MP camera sensor, the OnePlus 5 uses a combination of a 16MP sensor with a wide-angle lens and a 20MP sensor with a telephoto lens. Such a combination offers an option to zoom in when needed and a DSLR-like background defocus effect when clicking portraits. The company’s officials said that OnePlus could never match flagship phones from the likes of Apple and Samsung in the past, and it wanted to offer a camera that’s in the same league. Well, for starters, there’s no OIS, something that was present in the OnePlus 2, OnePlus 3, and the OnePlus 3T. There sensor size remains the same as last year (IMX 298 and IMX 398 have the same size at 1/2.8-inch), but the aperture is wider and there’s a new autofocus mechanism. The dual-pixel autofocus mechanism offers lightning quick focus times and much improved autofocus reliability. Overall, the images clicked using the OnePlus 5 in good lighting conditions appear more colourful than the ones clicked with the OnePlus 3 or 3T.. When it comes to low-light images, it’s a whole different story. Images come out relatively softer, with details getting smeared due to unwanted shakes as the phone’s electronic image stabilisation algorithm can’t cope up with them. Moreover, the secondary camera sensor fares even worse in low-light. The 2x zoom is more like 1.6x zoom, with the rest of the zoom attained by cropping the image because there’s more room, thanks to the higher resolution 20MP camera. The camera can click some decent portrait images, given that there’s enough light and enough separation between the subject and the background.. The selfie camera, in spite of using a 16MP sensor, doesn’t offer very good selfies. When the phone was first launched, it did not offer EIS in 1080p or 4K videos, and considering that there’s no OIS in OnePlus 5’s camera, videos had a lot of shakes. A few months later, the company added EIS in both 1080p @ 30fps and 4K @ 30fps video recording modes. Videos are smoother when there’s not very high movement. You can notice abrupt jerks when panning the camera. It still can’t handle EIS in 1080p @ 60fps video mode. It is not capable of recording very good quality videos, but can’t match the quality of the Galaxy S8 or the iPhone 7.. Overall, the OnePlus 5 has a good camera, but it can’t compete with the iPhone 7 Plus or the Galaxy S8 in photos or videos. However, it is better than what the Nokia 8 or the Mi Mix 2 have to offer, both in images and videos even though it lacks OIS, something that’s present in both, the Nokia 8 and the Mi Mix 2. I would say, the OnePlus 5 handles its own when compared to the affordable flagship phones, and maybe that’s what people want when they have the OnePlus 5 in mind.. One of the best things about OnePlus is that it offers a clean and relatively bloat-free software on its phones. Moreover, its OxygenOS offers meaningful features and a good amount of customisability. The OnePlus 5 runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat, and the company had rolled out three software updates over the course of the first two weeks of its launch and half a dozen more by the time we completed out long-term review, solving a lot of software bugs and improved the stability of the phone’s performance. It solved the GPS issue I faced as well. More on that in the performance section.. The automatic screen orientation on the phone is too eager. The OnePlus 5’s UI constantly switches to landscape mode even when it is lying on a perfectly flat table. This was quite an irritating experience for me, and I had to force the phone most of the times to be in the portrait orientation while reading articles or any other text content. The other thing that I didn’t like about the phone’s software is that there’s no easy way to use split-screen multitasking. You’ll have to enter the multitasking menu and then drag and drop an app’s window at the top and the other app’s window at the bottom to use them side by side. Other phones offer an easier to notice button for the same feature.. You can change app icon packs, switch to bright or dark UI modes, and use various accent colours. Two features that I used quite frequently were Gaming Do Not Disturb and Scrolling Screenshot. The former feature lets users enjoy games without accidental button presses or notifications (except alarms and calls). Mobile gaming enthusiasts will sure like this feature. Such a feature is also available in Samsung’s smartphones since two years. The Scrolling Screenshot allows users to capture longer screenshot, and it’s quite easy to use.. Thanks to the class-leading Snapdragon 835 processor that’s couple with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of UFS 2.1 storage, the OnePlus 5 is one of the fastest phones I’ve used this year. There are no stutters, frame drops, or lags. Installing apps was so fast, I couldn’t believe myself. However, I don’t think 8GB of RAM had much contribution to this smooth performance. I think that 4GB or 6GB is good enough for a phone.. Thanks to relatively lower 1080p resolution (but more than enough to offer sharper visuals), frame rates on the OnePlus 5 are better than the phones that have QHD displays. Using the phone for gaming is a joy to use. I just wish it had stereo speakers, which could make multimedia and gaming experience even more immersive. The phone doesn’t heat up to uncomfortable levels during gaming or while charging.. Cellular connectivity was reliable, but GPS was pathetic at first, at least in the review unit. It failed to track my location accurately, and this happened multiple times while using Google Maps for navigation. This bug was later improved with a software update. Loudspeaker is loud enough, but it lacks the depth and bass that I am accustomed to on my iPhone 7 Plus or on the HTC U11. The fingerprint sensor is definitely one of the fastest and most accurate I’ve ever used, much better than the one on the Nokia 8 or the Galaxy S8.. The phone features dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac and Bluetooth 5.0 (with aptX, aptX HD, and LE). I couldn’t test its Bluetooth 5.0 capabilities, because there’s no headphone in the market right now that are based on the newest version of Bluetooth. Gigabit Wi-Fi worked flawlessly when connected to my Netgear R7000 Nighthawk. Wi-Fi signal dropped only when I intentionally covered the phone tightly from all the sides using my palms, but that’s not how most people use their phones.. The OnePlus 5 uses a 3,300mAh, non-removable battery. This is a marginal 100mAh decrease from the battery that’s used in the OnePlus 3T. However, a relatively power-efficient Snapdragon 835 should negate that decrease. Apart from the company’s famous Dash Charge rapid charging technology (which is based on Oppo’s VOOC technology), the OnePlus 5 is also compatible with Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 2.0.. True to the company’s claim, the phone’s battery gets topped up to its 60% charge in just 30 minutes. You can expect it to fully charge from nil within 70 minutes, provided you use the Dash Charger and the USB cable that comes bundled with the phone. Dash Charge technology really changes the way you charge your phone. Never do you keep a phone on charging when you go to sleep. After getting used to the OnePlus 5, you tend to charge it only when the battery level drops below 10%.. When it comes to actual battery life numbers, the phone lasts close to 48 hours on a single charge with light usage, with the screen-on time leading to four hours. When it comes to heavy usage, the OnePlus 5 lasted well over 24 hours, with the screen-on time around five and a half hours. If you use the white theme, you should expect half an hour less screen-on time due to the AMOLED’s nature of consuming more power when displaying whites.. Overall, the battery life of the OnePlus 5 is one of the best in the high-end smartphone category, and better than last year’s OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T.. Ideally, we expect newer smartphones models to one up in quality in most aspects, if not all. We expected a lot of improvement in the camera department compared to the OnePlus 3 or the OnePlus 3T. Granted, there’s an additional camera sensor and the Portrait Mode is quite helpful, but the OnePlus 5’s camera is no match for the iPhone 7 Plus or the Galaxy S8, contrary to what the company claims. In spite of being much costlier than the OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus 3T, there’s not much of upgrade.. The OnePlus 5 has the exact same display as the OnePlus 3/3T, very slightly improved ergonomics, a similar camera in most regards (in spite of there being two sensors now), a similar software and hardware performance, and slightly improved battery life. This is just a comparison to the OnePlus 5’s predecessor. When you start comparing it with phones from other brands that fall in the same price range, you start to question the phone’s value-for-money factor even more.. OnePlus has concurred a victory with the OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus 3T all around the globe, to take the success even further, the company has launched the all-new OnePlus 5 with great hardware and software specifications. OnePlus has decided to skip the number 4 as it is regarded unlucky in China. The device retains the same solidly built metal body with a no-nonsense design.. OnePlus stuck to the Full HD resolution for almost 3 generations for its flagship device. Well, it still continues with the launch of OnePlus 5. The OnePlus 5 comes with a Full HD AMOLED (1920x1080) display; the screen size remains unchanged at 5.5-inch, which is regarded as the ideal screen size for a smartphone of this era. The OnePlus 5 s display is protected by the latest Gorilla Glass 5 from Corning.. The imaging department on the OnePlus 5 comes with huge surprises. OnePlus has shifted from the traditional 16MP unit on the OnePlus 3 to an all-new dual-camera setup including a 20MP sensor and a 16MP sensor. The high resolution isn't the only thing that amazes in the camera department; the camera has phase detection autofocus and EIS too. The secondary camera is the same 16MP unit carried from the OnePlus 3T. The OnePlus 5 can record 4K videos at 30FPS and Full HD videos at 120FPS.. The flagship devices from OnePlus are popular for their enormous amount of processing power and a huge amount of RAM, the OnePlus 5 goes in the same direction with its Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a massive 6GB of RAM. The OnePlus 5 is undoubtedly among the top smartphones devices that come with powerful hardware. The internal storage on the OnePlus 5 is 64GB with UFS 2.1 technology. However, a 128GB variant is available at a higher price tag. The unlocking of the device can be done with the front mounted fingerprint scanner.. As predicted earlier, the OnePlus 5 comes with Android 7.1.1 Nougat out-of-the-box. The OnePlus 5 retains the stock look of the Android UI, but it is comes loaded with plenty of exciting, useful features over the Stock Android. The software has its inbuilt application locker and a file vault to lock and hide sensitive user private data. Also, OnePlus provides all of its devices with monthly security updates for protection against software attacks.. The OnePlus 3T already had an above average battery backup with its 3,300 mAh battery. Now, with a more efficient hardware on the OnePlus 5, the battery backup has increased even with the use of the same 3,400 mAh sealed battery. The OnePlus 5 also retains the Dash Charge technology that charges 60% of battery in just 30 minutes.. There is nothing new in the connectivity department on the OnePlus 5, except the new Bluetooth v5.0 that supports faster data rates, as its predecessor had all the leading essential connectivity hardware like dual-band Wi-Fi ac/b/g/n with 2x2 MIMO, a 3.5mm audio jack, GPS with A-GPS, GLONASS, BDS, and a USB Type-C v3.1 port..

Please ask the question in above box. Which one is better between OnePlus 5 and Nokia 5?. I will prefer OnePlus 5; its performance is pretty good. I Would like to say that its camera is unexpectedly clear over my expectations. A good phone in economy price, over value for the money that you are paying. You'll not regret after you have it and you will then recommend to your friends.. Go for OnePlus 5, I use Nokia but there are a lot of issues. What are the specification and new features of this phone?. Dual camera, dash charging, fingerprint lock & outstanding overall performance are something that you can definitely expect from OnePlus 5. 6 GB RAM is pretty much good enough to stand out from the crowd & which will never let you down at any crucial scenarios.

There is no option to extend the external storage as OnePlus 5 does not support it, but again which is good enough to keep running a smartphone for 1-2 years without any further problem.

It will shut all other smartphone companies. Great quality display as well as best processor and best in class camera. Perfect device for tight budget customers. The battery backup will be awesome. So, just wait for 3 more months and buy a fully loaded device with amazing features and great quality.. The best thing I like about this phone is its camera and battery backup. It is giving me battery backup of 20 hours and the Dash Charger add more value to it, it will make the phone charge from 1 to 100 within 45 minutes.. I liked the new Android version. But the battery backup is only for one day as it has a lot of features.. It has best unique features like dash charge, lightweight and slim phone, front screen flash to click selfies, a loudspeaker with bass, etc.. Which one is the best mobile Honor 8 Pro or Oneplus 5?. If you need more memory, you are a game addict and like photography then Honor 8 Pro is enough. But if you are a frequent user, then go for OnePlus which has Dash Charge technology.. Which one is better between OnePlus 5 and Nokia 8?. There is no comparison with Nokia 8 or any other models.. No doubt OnePlus 5 as I have it.. It is sleek, and I am enjoying its features..

I’m a Verizon customer. Will it work for me? Is it true that calling 911 will cause the phone to reboot?. OnePlus 5 is now available in gold. See the Display and Design section below for the full slate of color options.. The original flagship killer is back with, well, another flagship killer. After weeks of leaks and rumors, OnePlus has released its sixth handset, the OnePlus 5, and it has the major Android players in its sights: the. And it looks to be a formidable competitor. Packing the fastest processor around in the Snapdragon 835, up to 8GB of RAM, a 3,300mAh battery, and dual cameras, the OnePlus 5 fills out the spec sheet for less. Here’s everything you need to know, including our full review of the OnePlus 5.. The OnePlus 5 was released in June 27, 2017, and is available for purchase through OnePlus’s website. The gray model with 64GB of storage and 6GB of RAM costs $479, and the black model with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM will set you back $539.. Like OnePlus’s other handsets, the 5 won’t be available through carriers, though OnePlus is calling it a “true world phone,” with support for 34 networks across the globe.. The OnePlus 5 is a major improvement over the 3 and 3T, but nearly all of the changes are on the inside. That means you’re getting the same display as last year at a higher price. So while it’s still a good deal, it’s not quite the killer bargain it was last year. There’s a lot more to it, so read our review for the full details.. The OnePlus 5 is fast, fast, fast, but its bland design and subpar dual-camera system hold it back.. At 7.25mm thick, the OnePlus 5 is the thinnest phone OnePlus has made. It has moved the camera to the upper-left corner like the iPhone rather than keeping it centered, and the antenna lines remain, meaning the back is made of aluminum and not glass.. The OnePlus 5 looks a lot like the iPhone 7 Plus from the back.. Around the front, OnePlus has resisted the bezel-trimming trend. It looks almost exactly like the 3T, with the same 5.5-inch Full HD 1920x1080 resolution display and pill-shaped home button/fingerprint sensor. Thankfully, it also still has the 3.5mm headphone jack on the bottom edge of the device and an alert slider on the left side. It is available in three color options, depending on options. Both models are available in a slate gray color, but to get it in soft gold you’ll need to choose the 64GB model, while the 128GB version is available in an exclusive midnight black color.. OnePlus has always packed its flagship handset with the latest silicone, and the Snapdragon 835 inside the OnePlus 5 is a screamer. Elsewhere, the phone brings 6GB or 8GB of RAM, 64GB or 128GB of UFS 2.1 storage, Bluetooth 5, and a 3,300mAh battery.. While the battery is smaller than the one in last year’s 3T, it’s more than big enough to get through a full day of use. Plus, the 5 uses OnePlus’ proprietary Dash Charge system to power up quicker than its competitors. However, since the OnePlus 5 has an aluminum back, it doesn’t support wireless charging like the S8 and G6.. OnePlus has hyped the heck out of the camera in the OnePlus 5. It ditches the older version’s single shooter in favor of a dual-camera system, pairing a custom Sony IMX398 16MP sensor with a large f/1.7 aperture with a 20MP telephoto one. Around the front you get a 16MP lens with f/2.0 aperture.. The OnePlus 5 features dual 16MP and 20MP sensors.. The system brings Fast AF and Smart Capture that will let you take shots instantaneously while filtering out noise and inconsistencies in low-light situations, as well as. improved HDR and a portrait mode that simulates a depth of field. It also features 1.6x optical zoom (up to 8x when combined with the digital zoom) and a pro mode that includes a tiny histogram so you can fine-tune the pixels. Notably neither lens features optical image stabilization.. In bright sunlight the OnePlus 5 (left) focused quickly, but the images were a bit too cool. The LG G6 (center) went in the other direction, and the Pixel (right) was spot on.. In our review it didn’t stack up against the G6 and the Pixel, but stay tuned for our camera shootout to see if it can unseat our current champion , the LG G6.. The OnePlus 5 runs OxygenOS based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat. Previous iterations haven’t strayed too far from stock Android, and the OnePlus 5’s version is no different. But there are some new features.. OxygenOS doesn’t mess with Android too much, but there are some changes.. As you use it, it will learn your habits and prioritize your apps accordingly on a new quick-launch area of the Shelf. A Do Not Disturb mode just for gaming will block notifications and disable the soft buttons for an uninterrupted experience. Secure Box lets you lock up documents, photos, and videos behind a fingerprint- or pin-protected folder. And a new Reading Mode will optimize the display in apps like Amazon’s Kindle reader to make words easier on your eyes.. There’s a reason OnePlus has jumped from the 3T to the 5. In Chinese culture, the number four is considered unlucky, like the number 13 in the U.S. This is due to the Chinese phonetic pronunciation of the number four being like the word for death and suffering. Many elevators in China skip the fourth floor, much like U.S. hotels often jump from floor 12 to 14.. You get a Dash charger and a cable, along with a SIM ejector tool. OnePlus still doesn’t include a free set of earbuds, though you can buy a pair from the OnePlus site for $20.. Yes! Just like its previous phones, OnePlus is selling a series of case available in faux wood, carbon fiber, and sandstone. Additionally, there’s a flip cover and an official Otterbox case in black or red.. While there are two nano SIM slots in the SIM tray, the OnePlus 5 doesn’t support SD cards for storage. So you might want to splurge on the bigger model if space is a concern.. OnePlus supplies a proprietary cable and a plug that is needed for Dash Charging. But since the OnePlus 5 doesn’t support the Quick Charge standard on the S8 and LG G6, if you don’t use the supplied cable and plug, the phone will charge as normal.. While the OnePlus 5 supports more bands than ever, Verizon’s isn’t one of them. So unless you want to switch to AT&T or T-Mobile, you’re out of luck.. There were a few reports on Reddit that OnePlus 5 users who dialed 911 in the U.S. or 999 in the UK, and had their phones reboot rather than place a call to emergency services. It doesn’t seem to have been a widespread problem, and OnePlus acted quickly to pinpoint the bug. In a statement, the company said,. “We have been in touch with the customer and have tested a software update that has resolved the issue. We will be rolling out the software update shortly. will be rolling out the software update shortly.” Users have reported the update is already hitting their phone. If you have a phone that is affected by the issue, you can contact OnePlus support at support@oneplus.net or (858) 609-6590 for more information..

Business Insider Logo Logo for Business Insider over a transparent background. You have successfully emailed the post.. The Galaxy S8 can do 8 things the new OnePlus 5 can't, but I'd still get the OnePlus 5. Business Insider/Antonio Villas-Boas Samsung's Galaxy S8 is the most feature-filled, beautiful smartphone you can get, period. It has the best camera, design, and screen, as well as the latest specs.. Yet despite these accolades, I'm still more attracted to the new OnePlus 5.. What could the Galaxy S8 possibly do wrong that makes me drift toward the OnePlus 5 instead?. I want to give the Galaxy S8 the credit it deserves, so check out all the things the Galaxy S8 can do that the OnePlus 5 can't â then see why I'd still pick the OnePlus 5:. The Galaxy S8 has a striking design compared with the OnePlus 5.. The OnePlus 5, left, and the Samsung Galaxy S8. The combination of the invisible home button, curved display edges, rounded display corners, taller aspect ratio, and ultra-narrow borders around its display makes the S8 a strikingly beautiful smartphone that's also more modern than the OnePlus 5 with its utilitarian design.. The Galaxy S8 has a sharper display.. It's hard to tell that the Galaxy S8's screen, right, is sharper than the OnePlus 5's. You can set the S8's display to a 1440p resolution, which is sharper than the OnePlus 5's 1080p resolution.. Samsung is keen to boast about the S8's IP 68 water resistance, which allows it to survive down to a depth of 1.5 meters (nearly 5 feet) for up to half an hour.. The Galaxy S8 features wireless charging.. Wireless charging is a nice feature to have for topping up the Galaxy S8 during the day. I can rest the Galaxy S8 on its wireless charging dock more easily than plugging it in when I'm not using it, and it pretty much guarantees I'll never run out of battery.. You can unlock the Galaxy S8 with your eyeballs.. I can hold up the Galaxy S8 to my eyes to unlock it without reaching for the fingerprint scanner.. You can also use your face to unlock the Galaxy S8.. The Galaxy S8's facial recognition also lets me unlock the phone by simply waking it up with the power button.. The Galaxy S8 features Samsung Pay, while the OnePlus 5 has only Android Pay. Samsung Pay on the Galaxy S8 works almost anywhere because it uses similar magnetic-based technology as a regular credit card. Meanwhile, Android Pay on the OnePlus 5, based on near-field communication, works only on payment terminals that have NFC technology.. The Galaxy S8 is the reigning champion of smartphone cameras.. The OnePlus 5's dual-lens camera certainly has its merits â it's an excellent camera that can do things the Galaxy S8 can't, like enabling the professional-looking portrait mode or enhanced optical zooming thanks to that second telephoto lens. Yet at the end of the day, the Galaxy S8 has the superior camera, especially in low-light situations.. There are so many great Galaxy S8 features, so why would I go for the OnePlus 5?. The first thing that gets my attention is the OnePlus 5's $480 price tag, compared with the Galaxy S8's $720 starting cost. Price, on its own, is a huge factor. I can buy a lot of things I like for the $240 I'd be saving by going for the OnePlus 5, such as video games, computer parts, and wine.. The Galaxy S8's fingerprint scanner is surprisingly frustrating to use.. I simply don't like the Galaxy S8's fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone. It's a matter of personal preference, and mine is a fingerprint scanner on the front of the phone because it's easier to find. I can also unlock phones with front-facing fingerprint scanners while they're resting on a table without first lifting the phone.. That said, Samsung may not have been able to make the Galaxy S8's borders so narrow had it kept the fingerprint scanner on the front. So, I can understand why the scanner is on the back.. I should note that the Galaxy S8's fingerprint scanner is inaccurate unless you place your finger perfectly on the scanner. That's a big problem, as the scanner isn't easy to find with your finger. I always end up placing my finger near the scanner and sliding it over to the scanner's center, and nine times out of 10, it wants me to rescan my fingerprint.. It's easier to find the S8's fingerprint scanner with the Samsung silicone case, but it's still not great.. The case's groove around the scanner helps guides my finger to its center. But the groove is so deep that not enough of my fingertip lands on the scanner unless I push hard with my finger. The Galaxy S8 often asks me to rescan my fingerprint two or three times with the case, too.. The OnePlus 5's fingerprint scanner is accurate and incredibly fast.. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 5's front-facing fingerprint scanner is easy to find, and it has never asked me to rescan my fingerprint. It's also incredibly fast â much faster than the Galaxy S8's fingerprint scanner.. Above, I'm pressing each phone's fingerprint scanner at the same time. The S8 has a delay to unlock compared with the OnePlus 5.. The Galaxy S8's iris-scanning feature isn't great either.. The Galaxy S8's iris scanner is fast and accurate, so long as you're holding the phone at a perfect distance from your eyes and they're lined up perfectly with the guide circles on the screen. Add that it's a multistep process to use the iris scanner â press the home button, swipe the lock screen, line up your eyes with the phone â and it quickly becomes a frustrating experience. It works, but it's not as fast or convenient as a fingerprint scanner.. Facial recognition on the Galaxy S8 doesn't always work well either.. The best way to unlock the Galaxy S8 I've found is facial recognition. It's fast and requires far fewer steps than the iris scanner. Yet it'll occasionally fail to register my face, and I either have to tap the tiny button to reattempt, use the ineffective fingerprint scanner, or enter my PIN.. But you'd feel the same way if you had difficulty unlocking your phone.. The Galaxy S8 is a fantastic phone, but I quickly became disenchanted with it because I simply couldn't unlock it as quickly and easily as other phones â and that's not great, because it's more expensive than those other great Android phones, including the OnePlus 5.. Unlocking a phone is a mundane task, but it's also extremely important: You're going to unlock your phone many, many times a day, so if it's a less-than-stellar experience, the monotony can become disheartening.. That said, my experience with unlocking the Galaxy S8 may not be the same for all S8 owners or prospective S8 owners. For me, though, the OnePlus 5 is a solid Android phone that's simply more reliable than the S8, despite the latter's exciting features.. SEE ALSO: You need to check out the new OnePlus 5 before buying any other Android smartphone. The Galaxy S8 can do 8 things the new OnePlus 5 can't, but I'd still get the OnePlus 5. The Galaxy S8 can do 8 things the new OnePlus 5 can't, but I'd still get the OnePlus 5. Samsung's Galaxy S8 is the most feature-filled....

Oxygen OS is a breath of fresh air Christopher Hebert/IDG. Should you buy it? Christopher Hebert/IDG. Update 8/7/17: This review has been updated to reflect a new gold color option.. There are certain things you can usually count on in a OnePlus phone: great performance, an awesome price, and a touch of originality. But with the OnePlus 5 , you’re only getting the first two parts of the three-part equation.. The OnePlus 5 is packed with the latest components on the inside, but its display is nothing special. It’s still a good deal cheaper than other premium phones, but even at a starting price of $479, it’s not quite a killer bargain. And its design, while nice-looking, is derivative of both previous OnePlus phones as well as Apple’s aging iPhone 7 Plus.. This time around, OnePlus’s new flagship isn’t about being different. Indeed, OnePlus’s marketing slogan may be “Never Settle,” but it feels like we’re doing an awful lot of settling with the OnePlus 5.. With the exception of the ultra-budget OnePlus X , OnePlus’s handsets have all had 5.5-inch screens. The OnePlus 5 continues this trend, using the exact same display found in the OnePlus 3 and 3T : a 5.5-inch, 1920x1080 screen with a pixel density of 401ppi. It’s not a bad display by any means, but it falls behind the the QHD screens on the Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 .. The OnePlus 5 has the same 5.5-inch AMOLED screen as the 3 and the 3T.. Like earlier OnePlus models, a home button/fingerprint sensor remains on the front, as do capacitive back and recent buttons.. OnePlus positions the OnePlus 5 as an alternative to the premium Android flagships, but with chunky bezels and an oversized frame, this latest model is more comparable to last year’s phones than this year’s. OnePlus still insists on shipping its phones with a full-fledged screen protector. This might have been charming with the OnePlus One, but now it’s just annoying. Once I took mine off, the phone looked and felt remarkably better, accentuating the curves of its 2.5D glass edges, and giving the mirrored home button proper room to breathe.. If the OnePlus 5 looks like a OnePlus 3T from the front, the back is all iPhone 7 Plus, with a dual camera setup in the top left corner and a OnePlus logo where the Apple symbol would be. Copying Apple isn’t the worst strategy to follow, but for a company with six phones under its belt, it seems unnecessary.. Quick: Which one is the OnePlus 5 and which is the iPhone 7?. At least the rear enclosure looks sharp. Available in gray, black, and gold, its polished aluminum surface is a nice contrast to the glass backs of its competitors, but it does easily pick up visible scratches. It’s also a little slippery to the touch, but its palm-friendly contours and thinness will probably limit the number of drops.. If you’re opposed to your Android phone looking so much like an iPhone, OnePlus again offers a series of official cases in a variety of faux finishes such as carbon fiber and wood grain. They fit nicely without adding much bulk, but I can’t help but wish OnePlus had designed the phone with as much flair and creativity as its cases.. OnePlus’s Do Not Disturb slider is the best thing to happen to Android phones.. Around the edges, OnePlus continues to offer a handy alert slider that instantly turns on Do Not Disturb, as well as a USB-C port, dual SIM slot, and a headphone jack. OnePlus poked a bit of fun at Apple during the unveiling of the OnePlus 5, but headphone jack jokes are getting tired, and OnePlus actually treats audio output as something of an afterthought: The box still doesn’t include earbuds, though the company. will sell you some for $20. With a Snapdragon 835 processor and up to 8GB of RAM, the OnePlus 5 is an absolute beast. This is the third phone with Qualcomm’s top-of-the-line chip that I’ve tested, and it felt significantly faster than either the S8 or the HTC U11. We’re talking zippy animations, speedy apps, and stutter-free scrolling.. I didn’t include benchmark charts in this review because OnePlus has admitted to gaming its phone to deliver high scores. I don’t see any reason why it had to fudge the numbers. If you’re looking for one of the fastest Android phones money can buy, the OnePlus 5 has to be right at the top of the list. The 8GB of RAM in my review unit helped keep the system humming along, and the phone’s virtually bloat-free OS gives it a Pixel-like smoothness out of the box.. Even the fingerprint sensor is absurdly fast. Granted, Google’s next handset will likely up the ante once again, but for now, the OnePlus 5 doesn’t just look like an iPhone 7—it feels as fast as one too.. Dash Charge helps fill up an empty OnePlus 5 in a jiffy.. Its battery is no slouch, either. While OnePlus didn’t deliver the monstrous 4,000mAh battery that was rumored, the one it has easily powers through a full day of heavy use, despite being 100mAh smaller than the battery in the 3T (3,300mAh vs. For reference, our benchmark tests showed it lasting a remarkable 10 hours (versus 6:54 for the 3T), and I have no reason to doubt those numbers are legit. The OnePlus 5 lasted long after my LG G6 needed a charge, and was neck-and-neck with the Galaxy S8+.. The OnePlus 5 also supports OnePlus’ Dash Charge system, which fills it up faster than its Quick Charging peers. However, you’ll still need to use the cumbersome red cable to get the benefits, and sadly the aluminum back means we still have to wait for wireless charging.. OnePlus is touting the 5’s camera as its biggest upgrade, and it’s hard to dispute that claim. OnePlus’s cameras have never really competed with the Galaxies and Pixels of the world, and the 5 certainly closes the gap.. OnePlus has added a second camera to the 5, but it still doesn’t compare to the best Android shooters.. But even with a custom Sony image sensor and a dual camera system that combines a 16MP lens with a 20MP telephoto len, the OnePlus 5 isn’t quite in the same league as its premium peers. The lack of optical image stabilization and its relatively small 1.12 µm pixel size are the biggest drawbacks, but its processing prowess isn’t quite there yet either. It’s not a bad camera by any means—in fact it’s quite good for a phone that costs less than $500—but in my testing it was a step below what I saw with the industry leaders.. In bright sunlight the OnePlus 5 (left) focused quickly, but the images were a bit too cool. The LG G6 (center) went in the other direction, and the Pixel (right) was spot on.. That said, the OnePlus 5 generally took great shots very quickly, with fast auto focus and shutter speed, even in HDR mode. The camera app is particularly good, with a clean layout and an excellent pro mode that even includes a tiny histogram. However, demanding shutterbugs might not be so keen on the results.. In harsh low light, the OnePlus 5 (left) produced noisy, out-of-focus images, while the LG G6 (center) and Pixel (right) performed much better.. Colors were vibrant if a bit on the cool side, but the excellent detail it was able to capture at a normal distance disappeared when using the 1.6x optical zoom. And in extreme low light, images were noisier than its competitors and the fast auto focus struggled mightily, often resulting in unusable shots.. The marquee feature of the OnePlus 5’s camera is portrait mode, another me-too feature borrowed from the iPhone 7 Plus. But OnePlus doesn’t pull it off nearly as well.. The portrait mode on the OnePlus 5 is just OK. In this image, there’s too much definition in the blurred background, and my son’s left arm and hair aren’t crisp.. For one, the depth effect isn’t pronounced enough. The subject stands out, but the faux bokeh isn’t as intense as it is on the iPhone. And OnePlus’ processing leaves quite a bit to be desired. Even when shooting against a solid background, it often took several attempts to lock in on my subject, and the edges tended to be extremely soft. Of course, Apple’s method isn’t perfect either, but even after numerous attempts, I was unable to shoot a flawless portrait shot with the OnePlus 5.. The One Plus 5 (left) picked up the detail of the leaves better than the LG G6 (center), but only the Pixel (right) got the color just right.. The 16MP front camera is essentially the same as the 3T’s, with blemish-removal sliders and a full-screen selfie “flash.” Electronic image stabilization helps a bit when the lights go down, but like the rear camera, for best results you’ll want to stick to bright spots.. OnePlus has always stayed faithful to Android with OxygenOS, and on the OnePlus 5, it’s nearly identical to Nougat. Sure, the build includes a few extra apps, but they’re removable, and you might not want to dump them. For example, File Manager is something Google might want to adopt for Android P, offering an overview of everything stored on your phone and providing a fingerprint-protected folder for your sensitive documents.. The OnePlus 5’s app drawer is refreshingly roomy.. This version of OxygenOS is based on the next-to-latest version, 7.1.1, but it feels as fresh as can be. Honestly, the only things I missed from my Pixel phone were the weather widget and the ability to type requests to Google Assistant—both small quibbles for sure. OnePlus’ OS is refreshingly clean and light, all of which makes the phone feel even faster.. Even without any clutter, though, OnePlus manages to add some pretty cool enhancements to Nougat. The practical Shelf returns with app shortcuts, and expanded gestures let you tweak the navigation to your liking. But the best feature by far is Reading Mode.. Reading Mode on the OnePlus 5 lets you designate certain apps for optimal viewing.. Instead of a dark mode or a simple blue light filter, the OnePlus 5 mimics the reflective, grayscale e-ink screens of Kindles and other e-readers, while also adapting the screen to the light around it. The result is nothing less than the most pleasant reading experience I’ve ever had on a phone.. There are a lot of reasons to buy the OnePlus 5. Performance-wise, it feels like the fastest phone around. It’s also thin and light, and has a headphone jack. And its retail price is cheaper than the Snapdragon 835 phones from Samsung and HTC by a fairly significant margin.. One Plus’s tagline is Never Settle, but it feels like you’re doing a lot of settling with the 5.. You can either pay $479 for 64GB of storage and 6GB of RAM, or $539 for 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. That’s kind of a no-brainer decision. (especially since you can't expand the storage with an SD card), so for most buyers, the OnePlus 5 will cost just about $540. That’s a great price—and certainly a better deal than the $750 Galaxy S8, or the $650 HTC U11 and LG G6.. with giveaways and carrier discounts, smart shoppers rarely pay full retail price for those phones. And when you factor in the lack of earbuds—an omission that was easier to overlook when OnePlus phones cost $299 and Samsung wasn’t shipping AKG buds—the difference isn’t quite so stark. And, as before, Verizon customers need not apply.. Beyond that, a brand new flagship phone, even a mid-range one, should feel like the very best piece of hardware you can buy. While the OnePlus 5 is a beast on the inside, its user-facing features—from superficial aesthetics to an outdated display—already feel quite stale. And in a year or two, the OnePlus 5 will probably feel downright ancient.. If such things don’t concern you, and you’re a happy AT&T or T-Mobile customer, you won’t find a better way to spend $550 on a phone. But for my money, I’d like to see a OnePlus flagship add up to something a little more than the sum of its specs..

Roydon Cerejo , 22 June 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The OnePlus 5 features dual rear cameras with EIS. Performance is blazing fast and ergonomics have improved too. The OnePlus 5 starts at Rs. OnePlus 5 design and build quality OnePlus 5 specifications and features OnePlus 5 performance, camera, and battery life Verdict. OnePlus has come a long way from its humble beginnings as a startup with its frustrating invite system to being one of the most sought-after enthusiast brands. All of its smartphones have stood for one thing – delivering leading specifications at aggressive prices, which is what has earned them the nickname "flagship killer". With each generation so far this has proven true, and the OnePlus 3 was a big leap forward over its predecessor when it launched.. The company officially unveiled its 2017 model, the OnePlus 5 on Tuesday, and it has already been launched in India. The OnePlus hype machine has been doing a good job of keeping the buzz alive, and there is huge pressure on the company to deliver yet another standout product. The OnePlus 5 has already garnered massive response back on its home turf, and was also teased in the final match of a recently concluded cricket tournament last Sunday.. So, is the OnePlus 5 everything it’s made out to be? And can it also earn the title of 'flagship killer'? We aim to answer these two burning questions in our OnePlus 5 review.. Now before we get started, we need to address the elephant in the room – design. From the front, this phone looks very similar to the OnePlus 3T ( Review ), but with more rounded corners and slight curves on the top and bottom. Given a fleeting glance, it would be hard to tell the two apart. The edges of the back have been shaved too, making the device more rounded overall. Antenna lines now wrap around the top and bottom of the rear to make space for the dual-camera module and LED flash. We have to admit, our first thought when we saw this was that it looks very much like an iPhone 7 Plus ( Review ), which is a common reaction because the style is definitely familiar.. This caused an uproar in our office, much like it did on the Internet when photos of the rear first leaked. Copying Apple’s designs is nothing new for many Chinese smartphone makers, but we guess most OnePlus fans expected something original. Once the initial surprise wears off, it’s not that big a deal. Build quality is still excellent thanks to the aluminium unibody, which is now slimmer at 7.25mm and lighter at 153 grams.. OnePlus has shaved off quite a bit of the side borders, and the glass curves along its edges, which makes the phone feel great when you hold it. It is a bit slippery without a cover as the sides are a lot thinner than on the OnePlus 3T, so that’s something to keep in mind. Luckily, the OnePlus 5 handles drops pretty well, and the couple of time we did accidentally drop it from waist height, we were left with only minor bumps and scuffs along the edges.. The 5.5-inch AMOLED panel really brings out deep blacks and rich colour saturation in content. Perhaps the best part here is that OnePlus has fixed the OnePlus 3T's annoying touch latency issue. The display supports the DCI-P3 colour profile, which is also used by the iPhone 7. This offers a wider gamut compared to sRGB. The colour tone simply feels more natural and is much easier on the eyes. Sadly, OnePlus is sticking to full-HD as the screen resolution, which is one of the few compromises it had to make to keep the cost down - all other flagships are now pushing QHD or even 4K .. The screen tends to wash out pretty easily under direct sunlight. It's worse if you use the ‘Dark’ theme, but even with the default appearance settings, things aren't exactly great. The OnePlus 5 ships with a pre-applied screen protector, which we think is unnecessary due to the use of Gorilla Glass 5. The protector doesn't cover the entire glass surface, so its edges rub against your fingers when you swipe from the sides of the phone, and lint accumulates at the edges.. In terms of physical connectors, we have a USB Type-C (USB 2.0 speed) port at the bottom along with a 3.5mm headphones socket and a speaker grille. Button placement remains the same as on previous models, with the power button on the left and the volume rocker plus an Alert Slider on the right. The Dual-SIM tray accepts two Nano-SIMs, and 4G is supported with VoLTE.. The OnePlus 5 does pack some new aesthetic touches such as the bevelled edges of the speaker grille and USB port being painted black. However, the paint around the camera bump on our Space Gray unit started chipping after just a day’s usage. When we questioned OnePlus, it told us that this was an isolated incident with our review unit since it was from an early batch. The Midnight Black unit we received didn't get damaged as easily, and although it wasn't as apparent, we did notice that small portions of the finish had faded after a week of usage.. In the box, you get a USB Type-C cable and a pretty chunky power adapter, which is the same as the one we got with the OnePlus 3T Midnight Black Edition. There aren’t any headphones or a cover bundled in the box. Overall, the OnePlus 5 feels a lot more ergonomic and comfortable to use than its predecessor due to its slimmer and lighter body. This phone is best used with a cover to avoid accidental slips (and possibly prevent undesired paint chipping around the camera bump). Between the two colour options, we think that black will be more popular.. OnePlus earned its reputation to begin with by offering top-end specifications, and the company hasn’t skimped here at all. The SoC of choice is Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835, which has eight CPU cores capable of running at up to 2.45GHz. There are two variants, Slate Gray with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, and Midnight Black with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. OnePlus is also making a big deal about the type of RAM and storage it has used for the OnePlus 5 - LPDDR4X and UFS 2.1 respectively, with a two-lane ROM which is said to double bandwidth for faster app install speeds and loading times.. In benchmarks, the OnePlus 5 put on a very good show compared to its peers, although it's best to take these number with a pinch of salt if you go by XDA Developers' report of how the OnePlus 5 potentially manipulates benchmarks for higher numbers. We initially ran tests that didn't require an Internet connection and also compared results to the scores we got after the Oxygen 4.5.1 update, which rolled out right after the global keynote. The scores did dip a little when compared to our earlier readings, which shows that OnePlus might have corrected whatever was going on with the original firmware. However, the Random Write test on the 128GB version of the 3T still trumps everyone else..

Other specifications include NFC, Bluetooth 5.0 with aptX and aptX HD support, dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac with 2x2 MIMO antennas, GPS, and USB-OTG. The fingerprint sensor is integrated into the home button. It's very quick at authentication and we rarely ever had a misread. You can use it to access locked apps and your Secure Folder in the File Manager app. You also get the usual suite of sensors along with a gyroscope. Certain features like FM radio and wireless charging are missing.. Apart from the OnePlus 5's brand new hardware, another big change is the slick new OxygenOS 4.5.0. It’s built on Android 7.1.1 Nougat and feels a bit more refined than before, with slightly smaller icons and text for the menus. There’s no app drawer button now as you simply swipe up to expand the dock, à la the Google Pixel. Swiping right takes you to Shelf, which lets you customise widgets for the weather, set reminders, see your recent apps, and monitor cellular data and storage usage. This can be disabled if needed. Long-pressing the icons of compatible apps brings up Nougat’s shortcuts to commonly used features.. The Settings app is where you’ll find most of the OnePlus 5's customisations. You can change the behaviour of the Alert Slider for its three settings – Ring, DnD and Silent. However, you still cannot set DnD to kick in automatically at a designated time. Doing this manually a huge chore, but it's something you have to get used to. The functions of the capacitive buttons can be swapped if needed, and you can enable on-screen buttons too. You can also assign functions to long- and double-presses of the Home and capacitive keys as per your needs. Screen gestures include a double-tap to wake, three-finger screenshot capture, and the ability to launch apps or a function by tracing letter shapes when the screen is of.. OxygenOS also has other cool features like Reading Mode, which turns the display monochrome, making it easier to read text. It also goes a step further and adjusts the white balance to the ambient light around you, so depending on the light, you’ll have anything from a pale white to pale yellow. You can select which apps need to run in Reading Mode, so it kicks in automatically when you launch them, or you can manually engage it for the entire OS. Expanded Screenshots essentially let you take scrolling screenshots of webpages; Night Mode can now be engaged automatically based on time; there are five vibration patterns for incoming calls; and Gaming DnD mode lets you disable the capacitive buttons and block notifications in apps of your choosing.. For the Indian market, OnePlus has added a shortcut to launch the Paytm app by simply long-pressing the Home button. It works with the screen off as well as on. This doesn’t actually let you make a payment via Paytm, but simply launches the app's QR code scanning page. In terms of pre-installed apps, you get Amazon's shopping, Prime Video and Kindle apps since this is Amazon exclusive, as well as Google’s suite of apps and a OnePlus Community app which lets you keep track of announcements and participate in the OnePlus forum.. With Qualcomm’s speedy processor and the slick new OxygenOS, system and app performance is excellent. The phone uses the ample RAM onboard to ensure things run smoothly. On average, we found around 3.9GB being used, leaving us with about 1.7GB on the 6GB model. Flicking through the apps in the app drawer and switching between them doesn’t put any stress on the phone, and the transitions are buttery smooth - dare we say Pixel-smooth. Call quality is very good and we never faced any audio issues during a call. The speaker is also pretty loud for conference calls.The ambient light sensor can be a bit too aggressive in low light, and we needed to override it manually at times to make the display brighter.. The OnePLus 5 excels at gaming and media playback. We went through extensive sessions of Asphalt 8 and GTA: Vice City and the phone easily held its own. We noticed a few dropped frames in Asphalt 8 in some levels but other than this, we had smooth framerates throughout. The best part is that the phone doesn’t overheat even when we used outdoors in our humid climate. The back gets a bit warm but nothing that would make you have to stop to let it cool down. The display produces very good colours and deep blacks, thanks to the AMOLED panel.. High-resolution videos played with ease, and the mono speaker belted out pretty high volumes. The phone also supports Dirac HD audio enhancements with earphones. This helps a bit, but we didn’t find the in-built DAC to be anything exceptional.. More than the design and powerful components, the biggest change that the OnePlus 5 ushers in is its dual rear cameras. The similarities with the iPhone 7 Plus extend well beyond just physical design, as even the camera app is pretty much identical. The app has a simple layout and it's easy to find what you’re looking for. Shooting modes are hidden in the hamburger menu in one of the corners.. The primary camera has a 16-megapixel sensor (Sony IMX 398) with a large f/1.7 aperture and electronic stabilisation (EIS). The focal length here is 24mm (35mm equivalent). The lack of optical stabilisation (OIS) is a big disappointment given that the OnePlus 3T had it. While we couldn’t get any official response from OnePlus as to why this decision was made, we think it could be due to the slimmer profile of the phone and perhaps done to keep the overall cost within control.. Tap to see full-sized OnePlus 5 camera samples. The second sensor has a 32mm focal length (35mm equivalent), 20-megapixel resolution and an aperture of f/2.6, but lacks EIS. To switch between the two sensors, you just have to hit the 2x button on the screen. According to OnePlus, optical zoom actually only goes up to 1.6x, and the rest is software but still "lossless". You can then zoom in all the way up to 8x (digital zoom). However, we noticed that the phone only actually switches to the second sensor when you’re in Photo mode and when there’s good lighting. If the light is anything less than ideal, the phone sticks to the primary camera and basically does a digital zoom instead. What would have been ideal is if the second sensor also had a decently large aperture, like at least f/2.0, which would have made it usable in low light too.. Portrait mode on the OnePlus 5 (Tap to see full size). There’s a Portrait Mode, just like on the iPhone 7 Plus, which uses the 20-megapixel sensor to gauge depth. Other than zoomed-in shots and Portrait Mode, the second sensor doesn’t seem to do anything else. We tried 2x mode in video, Pro, time-lapse and slow-motion modes, and in all of them, we would only get a digitally zoomed-in view from the primary sensor rather the software switching to the second sensor.. Image quality from the primary camera is very good. Landscapes and macro shots are very nicely detailed with accurate colours. Textures on objects are also very well-defined in close-up shots. There is some shutter lag, especially in low light, so if you need to get some action shots, your best bet is the burst mode. In low-light, the OnePlus 5 does a good job with details and noise is handled well. The telephoto sensor isn't very good at handling colours, which often look exaggerated.. Portrait mode can be accessed by swiping left on the viewfinder. The effect is similar to what the iPhone 7 Plus can deliver, and is useful when you need very shallow depth of field. The effect is good as long as the subject is in one focal plane, otherwise edges around your subject sometimes get blurred while parts of the background stay in focus. It also has trouble assessing finer details such as flowing hair, which it often gets wrong. Simulating bokeh effect for strands of hair is incredibly tough, and the iPhone 7 Plus struggles with it too. Pro mode lets you manually adjust basic exposure parameters (except the aperture), shows you a histogram in real time, lets your save RAW files, and even lets you define three custom presets.. Video quality is good and the choice of resolutions ranges from 720p to 4K (limited to 10 minutes at a time), with 1080p at 60fps also available. EIS works well at 1080p and 720p, but every now and then, there’s a "shimmering" effect in the scene, which is not very pleasant. There’s no option to turn it off. There’s no stabilisation at 4K, which is a shame since you end up with pretty shaky video clips if you move about. Since this is now software-based, we hope EIS is added in a future update. Overall, video quality is good in daylight and isn't too bad in low-light too.. The front 16-megapixel sensor features a f/2.0 aperture which captures very sharp and detailed images in good lighting. It’s not too bad in low light either, as the new app adds a screen flash. You also get Auto HDR and a Beauty mode.. The 3300mAh battery capacity is 100mAh lower than that of the OnePlus 3T, but we still managed to get good results. Our HD video loop test ran for 16 hours and 9 minutes. With regular use, the phone would just about last an entire day. While real-world usage could have better, the Dash Charging feature makes up for this. The bundled 20W charger works very rapidly and there’s a cool animation on the lockscreen when it kicks in. You’ll also get warning messages in the notification shade if any running app is draining the battery faster than it should (we got alerts for Uber and Apple Music a few times).. Loyal OnePlus fans and enthusiasts alike have been hoping that the OnePlus 5 would be yet another breakthrough product, especially since the company skipped the number 4. As it turns out, the new model is more of an iterative update to the OnePlus 3T, and after reviewing this phone, it feels a bit like it was rushed out in order to meet a deadline. On one hand, we have some notable changes like the more comfortable design and a better primary camera, and the improved specifications result in a significant boost in performance, but there's nothing about this phone that renders its predecessor obsolete.. We would have liked a better display, in terms of a higher resolution and better sunlight legibility. There's no wireless charging or waterproofing either, which is now common across today's flagships. The dual camera implementation doesn’t seem to be very well thought out, as not all the features work as they should right now. The lack of stabilisation at 4K is a big letdown, and EIS is step down from what was offered with the 3T. OnePlus could refine some rough edges with future software updates, but there might also be a mid-year OnePlus 5T with a bumped up SoC (hey, you never know).. If you currently own a OnePlus 3T, upgrading to the OnePlus 5 won’t change your life in any significant way. If you’ve been on the fence about upgrading from an older phone, we recommend getting the 6GB version of the OnePlus 5 as it offers very good value. The 128GB option feels a bit too expensive at its current price of Rs. Once stocks of the OnePlus 3T diminish, we hope that the 6GB OnePlus 5 will take the 3T’s current spot at Rs. 29,999, bringing the 8GB version down to a more attractive price as well.. OnePlus' focus for the OnePlus 5 seems to be refining a winning formula rather than slaying flagships. It's still a great smartphone for the price, but if you were hoping for refinements and features that Samsung and Apple offer today in their flagships, then you might be disappointed..
