Ãtlagos pontszÃ¡m: 70.44% - Ã¡tlagos Ãtlag. 82% Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro review â Premium dual selfie camera smartphone ForrÃ¡s: Gogi.in EN→HU The Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro is made for selfie lovers. The front camera is impressive but when you compare it with the shots taken with the Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Dual, the Selfie Dual does a better job (bokeh looks much better). EgyÃ©ni teszt, online elÃ©rhetÅsÃ©g, KÃ¶zepes, DÃ¡tum: 10/24/2017 ÃrtÃ©kelÃ©s: ÃsszpontszÃ¡m : 82%. 74% Asus ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro review: A versatile tool for vloggers, but some refinements are definitely needed ForrÃ¡s: Tech2 EN→HU Asus ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro is a well made smartphone and at Rs 23,999, the price may seem a slight bit more than competition. Dual-front facing cameras with wide-angle option and a softlight LED bulb means that it is a boon for the selfie enthusiasts. However, I must add the caveat that the exposure can be off at times with the front camera. If Asus could resolve this shortcoming with a relevant software patch, then the ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro could easily achieve some of the objectives it has set out to. Overexposure of surroundings in daylight with the front camera shots is annoying.

Its hardware is just right for an upper-midrange device, its user interface is smooth and its customizations are actually fun to play around with. Its thin profile and metal build make it look and feel like a premium handset, yet it still holds a rather large battery and definitely lasts a while. Its display is a pleasure to look at and can be set to taste, whether you love super-punchy colors or soft and subdued ones.

ASUS Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro Video Review ForrÃ¡s: Yugatech EN→HU Among the recently-released ASUS Zenfone 4 smartphones, you can pretty much surmise what the Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro has to boast about. Itâs got dual front cameras on board, which ASUS claims to offer great quality for selfies and we-fies but is it all there is to this device? EgyÃ©ni teszt, online elÃ©rhetÅsÃ©g, Nagyon rÃ¶vid, DÃ¡tum: 09/28/2017. 66% Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie pro Review ForrÃ¡s: Think Digit EN→HU The Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro makes a big promise with its 24MP "duopixel" feature, but it's actually not very useful. That makes it an unfavourable choice for selfie lovers, and there are better options out there. Vloggers will probably like the 4K selfie videos feature, but there's not much more worth recommending this phone for. EgyÃ©ni teszt, online elÃ©rhetÅsÃ©g, HosszÃº, DÃ¡tum: 09/28/2017 ÃrtÃ©kelÃ©s: ÃsszpontszÃ¡m : 66%. Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro review: Dual front cameras on board, but does it deliver? ForrÃ¡s: The Indian Express EN→HU The highlight of Asus Zenfone Selfie 4 Pro is its dual selfie camera. Thereâs no denying that the front shooter is impressive, but what makes the phone a less viable option is the price-tag of Rs 23,999 which is expensive. The phone makes sense only for people whoâd buy it solely for the selfie camera. EgyÃ©ni teszt, online elÃ©rhetÅsÃ©g, RÃ¶vid, DÃ¡tum: 09/28/2017. 70% Asus ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro Review ForrÃ¡s: NDTV Gadgets EN→HU The Asus ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro is a pretty feature-rich offering at this price level, and weâd say it's a better bet than Vivoâs V7+. If youâre into vlogging on your smartphone, then youâll appreciate the 4K recording support with the front camera. We donât get why Asus had to resort to gimmicky features like the 24-megapixel DuoPixel mode, when the Sony sensor is capable of good things by itself. ZenUI 4 certainly looks leaner, but not much has really changed beneath the surface. Our main concerns here would be the weak sunlight legibility of the display and the fact that the cameras (all three of them) really struggle to give satisfactory results in low light. EgyÃ©ni teszt, online elÃ©rhetÅsÃ©g, KÃ¶zepes, DÃ¡tum: 09/27/2017 ÃrtÃ©kelÃ©s: ÃsszpontszÃ¡m : 70% Ã¡r: 70% teljesÃ­tmÃ©ny: 80% kijelzÅ: 80% mobilitÃ¡s: 70% Ã¶sszeszerelÃ©s: 80%. ASUS Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro review: A boon to selfie enthusiasts ? ForrÃ¡s: Gadget Diary EN→HU Overall the Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro is brilliant device offering top-of-the-line features, a great selfie camera setup, a crisp display, and a decent battery reservoir. Although the phone offers such great features, it still feels a tad expensive at Rs 23,990. But if you are someone who loves to click selfies and can make good use of that feature, then you should definitely put your money on this one. EgyÃ©ni teszt, online elÃ©rhetÅsÃ©g, RÃ¶vid, DÃ¡tum: 09/22/2017. Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro Review: The Force is not too strong with this one! ForrÃ¡s: The Mobile Indian EN→HU To conclude, the Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro does sport a sleek look and it is certainly one of the slimmest smartphone available in the market. However, when it comes it clicking selfies, the phone does a good job when the lighting condition is good, but there is a loss quality when you switch to the wide-angle lens. The rear camera does a decent job as well. Coming to the performance, there isnât much to complain, but the battery backup is not up to the mark. Considering the price tag and specs and performance it offers, the Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro looks a tad overpriced smartphone, especially when you get the same specs around Rs 15,000 in India. EgyÃ©ni teszt, online elÃ©rhetÅsÃ©g, KÃ¶zepes, DÃ¡tum: 09/22/2017. 60% Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro review: Worth a âshotâ but not worth the price ForrÃ¡s: Gadget Show EN→HU The Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie comes with a price tag of Rs 23,999. Designed specifically for selfie lovers, the USP of the smartphone is its dual selfie camera. Other than this all the other specifications are similar to any budget smartphone available in the market. The price of the phone is a huge deterrent even though the performance and looks of the phone do stand out. There are alternatives like the Vivo V7+ which sells for Rs 21,999 if you're looking for a selfie smartphone. The Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie delivers what it promises but perhaps isn't worth the price it commands. In that sense, Asus might have just scored a self(ie) goal! EgyÃ©ni teszt, online elÃ©rhetÅsÃ©g, RÃ¶vid, DÃ¡tum: 09/17/2017 ÃrtÃ©kelÃ©s: ÃsszpontszÃ¡m : 60%. Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro First Impressions: Dual front cameras to ease your selfie obsession! ForrÃ¡s: The Mobile Indian EN→HU To conclude, the Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro offers a sleek design and it surely one of the lightest and slimmest devices available in the market right now. The dual front cameras do take some selfies in our initial testing. However, looking at the sheer specs sheet, it looks a bit overpriced in nature. As for the competition is concerned, it faces a stiff competition with the likes of Gionee A1, Oppo F3s, Motorola Moto G5S Plus and Honor 8 Lite, as the first two devices take good selfies, while the other two scores good marks in the overall performance. EgyÃ©ni teszt, online elÃ©rhetÅsÃ©g, RÃ¶vid, DÃ¡tum: 09/14/2017. ASUS ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro review - An almost perfect ASUS Selfie Phone ForrÃ¡s: Tech Nave EN→HU The ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro is almost a perfect selfie smartphone, if it wasn't for the somewhat subpar 5MP camera sensor performance, it could have easily been the go-for selfie smartphone in the Malaysia market (#soclose). If you don't really mind about that, then go for it. The 24MP DuoPixel technology is great, same goes for the rear camera, it is a compact device, has good battery performance (but not for intense gaming) and the Selfie Master app should prove to be a favourite for selfie lovers and vloggers too. EgyÃ©ni teszt, online elÃ©rhetÅsÃ©g, Nagyon hosszÃº, DÃ¡tum: 09/13/2017. ASUS Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro Review ForrÃ¡s: Yugatech EN→HU ASUS is definitely back in the selfie game with the ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro. It came a bit late, though, considering that its competitors, namely OPPO and Vivo, have already established a strong presence in the market with their selfie-centric devices. Still, itâs a worthy offering given its slim and premium body, AMOLED display, fun yet capable cameras, and improved ZenUI 4.0. EgyÃ©ni teszt, online elÃ©rhetÅsÃ©g, KÃ¶zepes, DÃ¡tum: 09/06/2017. ASUS Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro Review ForrÃ¡s: Manila Shaker EN→HU With how the ZenFone 4 Selfie Proâs front cameras perform, I canât help but feel that this is not the best at its price. However, the overhauls and upgrades make it worth looking for those who are willing to shell out more than the usual. With a commanding PhP 18,995, the ZenFone 4 Selfie Proâs performance and features fall a bit short but is still reliable for a day-to-day use. EgyÃ©ni teszt, online elÃ©rhetÅsÃ©g, HosszÃº, DÃ¡tum: 08/20/2017. ASUS ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro Hands On: Featuring A Very Peculiar Set of Two Front Cameras ForrÃ¡s: Lowyat.net EN→HU All in all, the decision made by the team behind ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro to take additional time to craft this selfie-oriented phone seems to be quite fruitful although there are still a lot of rooms for improvement especially in camera quality which can be delivered through software updates from time to time. EgyÃ©ni teszt, online elÃ©rhetÅsÃ©g, RÃ¶vid, DÃ¡tum: 08/18/2017. ASUS ZenFone 4 Selfie, Selfie Pro Quick Review: Let The Selfie Wars Begin!

The front camera is impressive but when you compare it with the shots taken with the Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Dual, the Selfie Dual does a better job (bokeh looks much better).

Dual-front facing cameras with wide-angle option and a softlight LED bulb means that it is a boon for the selfie enthusiasts. However, I must add the caveat that the exposure can be off at times with the front camera. If Asus could resolve this shortcoming with a relevant software patch, then the ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro could easily achieve some of the objectives it has set out to. Overexposure of surroundings in daylight with the front camera shots is annoying.

Its hardware is just right for an upper-midrange device, its user interface is smooth and its customizations are actually fun to play around with. Its thin profile and metal build make it look and feel like a premium handset, yet it still holds a rather large battery and definitely lasts a while. Its display is a pleasure to look at and can be set to taste, whether you love super-punchy colors or soft and subdued ones. Ãnico AnÃ¡lisis, disponible online, Muy largo, Fecha: 10/03/2017 PuntuaciÃ³n: PuntuaciÃ³n total : 70%. ASUS Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro Video Review Origen: Yugatech EN→ES Among the recently-released ASUS Zenfone 4 smartphones, you can pretty much surmise what the Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro has to boast about. Itâs got dual front cameras on board, which ASUS claims to offer great quality for selfies and we-fies but is it all there is to this device? Ãnico AnÃ¡lisis, disponible online, Muy corto, Fecha: 09/28/2017. 66% Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie pro Review Origen: Think Digit EN→ES The Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro makes a big promise with its 24MP "duopixel" feature, but it's actually not very useful. That makes it an unfavourable choice for selfie lovers, and there are better options out there. Vloggers will probably like the 4K selfie videos feature, but there's not much more worth recommending this phone for. Ãnico AnÃ¡lisis, disponible online, largo, Fecha: 09/28/2017 PuntuaciÃ³n: PuntuaciÃ³n total : 66%. Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro review: Dual front cameras on board, but does it deliver? Origen: The Indian Express EN→ES The highlight of Asus Zenfone Selfie 4 Pro is its dual selfie camera. Thereâs no denying that the front shooter is impressive, but what makes the phone a less viable option is the price-tag of Rs 23,999 which is expensive. The phone makes sense only for people whoâd buy it solely for the selfie camera. Ãnico AnÃ¡lisis, disponible online, corto, Fecha: 09/28/2017. 70% Asus ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro Review Origen: NDTV Gadgets EN→ES The Asus ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro is a pretty feature-rich offering at this price level, and weâd say it's a better bet than Vivoâs V7+. If youâre into vlogging on your smartphone, then youâll appreciate the 4K recording support with the front camera. We donât get why Asus had to resort to gimmicky features like the 24-megapixel DuoPixel mode, when the Sony sensor is capable of good things by itself. ZenUI 4 certainly looks leaner, but not much has really changed beneath the surface. Our main concerns here would be the weak sunlight legibility of the display and the fact that the cameras (all three of them) really struggle to give satisfactory results in low light.

Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro Review: The Force is not too strong with this one! Origen: The Mobile Indian EN→ES To conclude, the Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro does sport a sleek look and it is certainly one of the slimmest smartphone available in the market. However, when it comes it clicking selfies, the phone does a good job when the lighting condition is good, but there is a loss quality when you switch to the wide-angle lens. The rear camera does a decent job as well. Coming to the performance, there isnât much to complain, but the battery backup is not up to the mark. Considering the price tag and specs and performance it offers, the Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro looks a tad overpriced smartphone, especially when you get the same specs around Rs 15,000 in India. Ãnico AnÃ¡lisis, disponible online, Mediano, Fecha: 09/22/2017. ASUS Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro review: A boon to selfie enthusiasts ? Origen: Gadget Diary EN→ES Overall the Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro is brilliant device offering top-of-the-line features, a great selfie camera setup, a crisp display, and a decent battery reservoir. Although the phone offers such great features, it still feels a tad expensive at Rs 23,990. But if you are someone who loves to click selfies and can make good use of that feature, then you should definitely put your money on this one. Ãnico AnÃ¡lisis, disponible online, corto, Fecha: 09/22/2017. 60% Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro review: Worth a âshotâ but not worth the price Origen: Gadget Show EN→ES The Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie comes with a price tag of Rs 23,999. Designed specifically for selfie lovers, the USP of the smartphone is its dual selfie camera. Other than this all the other specifications are similar to any budget smartphone available in the market. The price of the phone is a huge deterrent even though the performance and looks of the phone do stand out. There are alternatives like the Vivo V7+ which sells for Rs 21,999 if you're looking for a selfie smartphone. The Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie delivers what it promises but perhaps isn't worth the price it commands. In that sense, Asus might have just scored a self(ie) goal! Ãnico AnÃ¡lisis, disponible online, corto, Fecha: 09/17/2017 PuntuaciÃ³n: PuntuaciÃ³n total : 60%. Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro First Impressions: Dual front cameras to ease your selfie obsession! Origen: The Mobile Indian EN→ES To conclude, the Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro offers a sleek design and it surely one of the lightest and slimmest devices available in the market right now. The dual front cameras do take some selfies in our initial testing. However, looking at the sheer specs sheet, it looks a bit overpriced in nature. As for the competition is concerned, it faces a stiff competition with the likes of Gionee A1, Oppo F3s, Motorola Moto G5S Plus and Honor 8 Lite, as the first two devices take good selfies, while the other two scores good marks in the overall performance. Ãnico AnÃ¡lisis, disponible online, corto, Fecha: 09/14/2017. ASUS ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro review - An almost perfect ASUS Selfie Phone Origen: Tech Nave EN→ES The ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro is almost a perfect selfie smartphone, if it wasn't for the somewhat subpar 5MP camera sensor performance, it could have easily been the go-for selfie smartphone in the Malaysia market (#soclose). If you don't really mind about that, then go for it. The 24MP DuoPixel technology is great, same goes for the rear camera, it is a compact device, has good battery performance (but not for intense gaming) and the Selfie Master app should prove to be a favourite for selfie lovers and vloggers too. Ãnico AnÃ¡lisis, disponible online, Muy largo, Fecha: 09/13/2017. ASUS Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro Review Origen: Yugatech EN→ES ASUS is definitely back in the selfie game with the ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro. It came a bit late, though, considering that its competitors, namely OPPO and Vivo, have already established a strong presence in the market with their selfie-centric devices. Still, itâs a worthy offering given its slim and premium body, AMOLED display, fun yet capable cameras, and improved ZenUI 4.0. Ãnico AnÃ¡lisis, disponible online, Mediano, Fecha: 09/06/2017. ASUS Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro Review Origen: Manila Shaker EN→ES With how the ZenFone 4 Selfie Proâs front cameras perform, I canât help but feel that this is not the best at its price. However, the overhauls and upgrades make it worth looking for those who are willing to shell out more than the usual. With a commanding PhP 18,995, the ZenFone 4 Selfie Proâs performance and features fall a bit short but is still reliable for a day-to-day use. Ãnico AnÃ¡lisis, disponible online, largo, Fecha: 08/20/2017. ASUS ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro Hands On: Featuring A Very Peculiar Set of Two Front Cameras Origen: Lowyat.net EN→ES All in all, the decision made by the team behind ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro to take additional time to craft this selfie-oriented phone seems to be quite fruitful although there are still a lot of rooms for improvement especially in camera quality which can be delivered through software updates from time to time. Ãnico AnÃ¡lisis, disponible online, corto, Fecha: 08/18/2017. ASUS ZenFone 4 Selfie, Selfie Pro Quick Review: Let The Selfie Wars Begin! Origen: Unbox EN→ES ASUS ZenUI is still on board, and while weâd still prefer a lighter UI overall this yearâs iteration is much better compared to the bloat-ware ridden mess last year. Thereâs only a few additional apps that are installed when we got the device, which makes for a more pleasant experience.

Here's the review all you other folks looking to buy a phone are waiting for (something I wish I could have read before ordering!) At this point in time, almost 2 week after ordering, I would 100% recommend EGlobal Central as the store you should buy your next new phone from. Don't want to pay the stupid high list price in Canada? Don't want to pay to unlock your phone or to stay stuck on a contract? Buy from them!. It took only 2 days from when the order was placed to when I received it, amazing. The price was great and the product was just as promised. I will not hesitate ordering product from eGlobal Central again. I wholeheartedly recommend eGlobal Central Us!. I was a little skeptical ordering a $1000 Nikon lens from a online store knowing it would be shipped from overseas. The transaction began as a totally secure internet payment procedure, followed by a next morning email stating shipment being prepared. The 2nd day I already had a DHL tracking number !! I had my lens in hand on the 5th day !! I saved over $400 on this lens and the packaging material was abundant, thorough, and arrived in perfect condition as described.
