Here is everything we know about the HTC U11 Eyes. Last year, HTC brought us three smartphones — the HTC U11 and U11 Plus, along with the HTC U11 Life .. While the company has yet to confirm details, rumors hint at a new addition to the lineup known as the HTC U11 Eyes. recent tweet by Venture Beat’s Evan Blass includes a fair amount of details concerning what to expect from the midrange smartphone.. Here’s everything we know about the HTC U11 Eyes.. The HTC U11 Eyes reportedly features a 6-inch screen with 1,080 x 2,160 Super LCD3 display. With photos by way of Blass, it comes in three different color variants — black, silver, and red. To the far right of the device are two front-facing cameras that resemble a pair of “eyes” — which is most likely why the device has its name.. On the back, you’ll find a single camera with dual-LED and dual-tone flash. Right below it is a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner and on the bottom is a USB-type C port for fast charging.. HTC released a device back in 2014 under the “Eye” brand as well, known as the Desire Eye. While it’s clearly far more dated, it’s easy to see a resemblance between the two. This time around, the U11 Eyes looks to be made out of metal and glass with rounded corners and thin bezels. It will also include Edge Sense — featured on its predecessors as well — which allows you to squeeze the bottom edges of the device to perform different shortcuts.. Under the hood, the HTC U11 could include a Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor along with a 3,930mAh battery. In terms of storage, there will be 4GB of RAM and expandable storage of up to 64GB via a MicroSD card. It also has an IP67 certification when it comes to water and dust resistance. Some users may be disappointed to know that it will run Android Nougat instead of Oreo.. The U11 Eyes is expected to launch on January 15 and will reportedly be priced at $510. That date is also the same one listed on the official invitation for HTC’s upcoming press event in China. — which included the keyword “Eye” — first spotted by PlayfulDroid ..

It's basically a cheaper U11+ but with more fun features, like AR stickers for selfies.. Well, that was quick: HTC's promised return to a dual-camera smartphone is already here. Meet the U11 Eyes which, as the name implies, is a selfie-centric smartphone featuring a pair of cameras on the front. These deliver live bokeh effect which supports re-focus after capture -- just like the good old days with previous dual-camera HTC phones.. And yes, the U11 Eyes reuses the same shiny "Liquid Design" as the flagship U11+ , but swapping out a few flagship-level features for a more affordable price. You'll find an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 chipset (which is approaching two years old ), a 2,160 x 1,080 LCD instead of QHD, just three microphones instead of four (so no acoustic focus when using zoom in video recording) and no BoomSound speakers (so no stereo nor "Hi-Fi" output).. Gallery: HTC U11 Eyes hands-on | 24 Photos. That said, you'll still find a handful of familiar goodies, including the excellent 12-megapixel f/1.7 main camera (with O.I.S. and 4K video recording), Hi-Res audio capture, USonic self-tuning earphones, Edge Sense squeeze input, a generous 3,930mAh battery and the U11's IP67 water plus dust resistance (the U11+ has IP68). The easiest way to tell a U11 Eyes and a U11+ apart is by looking at the ring around the main camera: the former has a thinner and shinier ring, which is the most apparent on the Solar Red version -- the gold ring combined with the glossy red body would definitely get a seal of approval from Iron Man.. Both the U11 Eyes' front cameras come in at 5 megapixels with f/2.2 aperture plus a wide 80-degree view -- a somewhat disappointing choice compared to the original 8-megapixel f/2.0 imager with 85-degree capture, but perhaps HTC couldn't fit larger sensors here due to its design choice. Still, they benefit from the same HDR Boost function as the UltraPixel 3 main camera, and the single camera -- the one by the earpiece -- responsible for video recording can record up to 1080p. In addition to live bokeh, the camera's selfie mode also supports live beautification -- you can either use auto mode or go manual with options for skin smoothing, skin brightening, face slimming and eye enlargement.. But what really got me hooked were the AR stickers for selfies. Taking a page out of Snapchat and Facebook's , um, books, HTC is offering a set of cartoon animations -- be it a hat, facial hair, sunglasses, foods, bunny ears and more -- that automatically map to everyone's faces within the canvas, so long as the faces are large enough to be recognized. At one point, we crammed eight people into a group selfie and the camera still managed to turn us into a bunch of teenagers make us all look cuter.. AR stickers are actually available to both the front and back cameras, but they are limited to still photos. There are apparently still some kinks to be ironed out, so AR stickers won't land on the U11 Eyes until some time before mid-February -- it'll arrive as an update via Google Play. While this feature only requires a single camera, HTC says it currently has no plans to add it to its other U11 devices.. Joining the likes of OnePlus and a few other Chinese smartphone makers, HTC is also jumping on the face unlock hype train with the U11 Eyes. Again, using just a single camera, the camera looks out for 128 feature vectors on a face, and it can somehow distinguish between a real human face and attempts with still photos or video clips. It's also able to recognize its owner if when he or she puts on a hat, sunglasses (to a certain extent of darkness) or even a breathing mask -- an item popular amongst scooter riders in Taiwan. As a bonus, this method can be paired with Edge Sense unlock: simply squeeze the dormant phone while looking at the front camera, and you're good to go.. It should be noted that this face unlock is more for the sake of convenience, which is why this face unlock option isn't available for authorizing mobile payments -- you'll still have to tap the rear fingerprint reader or type in your password for that. Interestingly, this is one feature that HTC is considering to roll out to other U11 devices, so stay tuned.. It's unclear as to when the U11 Eyes will be available in markets beyond Greater China, but for those who happen to reside in that region, the 64GB model with 4GB of RAM be available for HK$3,898 or about US$500 in Hong Kong as of this Wednesday, and you'll get three familiar color options: "Solar Red," "Amazing Silver" (which is more of a shiny blue) and "Ceramic Black.". According to our local sources, the price may actually hit HK$3,200 or about US$410 on launch day, which is more acceptable for a phone powered by a chipset from 2016; but then again, maybe the fun cameras combined with a unique design will justify this for ordinary users. Either way, it won't mean much without some serious marketing push or miracle work, especially in Mainland China where it's been struggling to return to top five for years.. arsticker , dualcamera , eyes , gear , hands-on , htc , mobile , smartphone , snapdragon652 , u11 , u11eyes.

HTC U11 EYEs goes official with dual 5MP front cameras, 6-inch FHD+ screen, $500+ price. Adrian Diaconescu January 15, 2018 4:04 am. As predicted late last week , HTC’s fourth U11 variant has become official earlier today in the company’s native land of Taiwan, following the new 2:1 display aspect ratio direction dictated by the high-end U11+ .. But although the U11 EYEs is certainly no pushover all in all, it’s also by no means a powerhouse, packing an octa-core Snapdragon 652 processor that’s been around for almost two years now.. On the bright side, the decidedly middling chip is paired with a robust 4GB RAM, as well as a large 3930mAh battery. In fact, that’s the same cell size found under the hood of the U11+, and the HTC U11 EYEs may actually be able to keep the lights on longer between charges, courtesy of its frugal SoC.. The similarities obviously don’t stop there, even if the 6-inch 2:1 screen on the U11 EYEs unsurprisingly produces fewer pixels than the 6-inch 2:1 panel on the U11 Plus, at 2160 x 1080, aka Full HD+, compared to 2560 x 1440, or Quad HD+.. The U11 EYEs also uses older Super LCD 3 technology, and its red, silver and black color options are definitely snazzy and shiny, but with no translucent “liquid surface” design, they lack a certain je ne sais quoi to stand out from the upper mid-range crowd.. Of course, just like the U11 , U11+ and U11 Life , HTC’s newest offers Edge Sense “innovation”, aka squeezy sides, as well as premium USonic sound technology with active noise cancellation, and water and dust resistance.. The cameras may just be the biggest draw here, with a single but excellent 12MP shooter mounted on the back, and two 5MP selfie-friendly sensors capable of various bokeh tricks, as well as “Instant Skin Adjustment” and other beauty-enhancing functions.. A rear-positioned fingerprint reader helps the HTC U11 EYEs keep those bezels nice and thin, while the pre-installed Android version is unspecified on the OEM’s official Taiwanese website, which probably means it’s 7.1 Nougat.. Unfortunately, the price point doesn’t sound ideal, at NT$14,900 ($505) and 3299 yuan ($512) in China, with 64GB internal storage and microSD expansion capabilities. But perhaps the Western Hemisphere will get it for less. If it ever makes its way across the Pacific, that is.. Android , China , HTC , News , Taiwan , U11 , U11 EYEs.

HTC U11 EYEs Announced With Thin Bezels, UltraPixel 3 Camera. January 15, 2018 - Written By Kristijan Lucic.

HTC U11 EYEs with dual front-facing cameras could launch on January 15. by Mitja Rutnik January 12, 2018. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. HTC is gearing up to announce a new smartphone. The company has published a press invite on its Weibo account for an event taking place on January 15 in China, where it’s expected to take the wraps off the U11 EYEs. This hasn’t officially been confirmed yet, but it’s a safe bet given the fact that HTC emphasized the word Eye in its Weibo post.. Although the company hasn’t shared any details about the device, we already know a lot about it. According to Evan Blass, it could sport a 6-inch Full HD+ display, which means it should have an aspect ratio of 18:9. The device is said to be powered by the Snapdragon 652 chipset, have 4 GB of RAM, and pack a 3,930 mAh battery.. HTC U11 EYEs (Harmony): 6″ FHD+ (1080 x 2160) Super LCD3, SD652 octa core, 4GB/64GB (+microSD), USB-C, 3930mAh, IP67, Android Nougat, Edge Sense. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) January 12, 2018. Other specs include 64 GB of expandable storage, an IP67 rating for protection against water, and Edge Sense that lets you open an app of choice by squeezing the device. The U11 EYEs may launch with Nougat on board, but will likely get upgraded to Oreo somewhere down the line.. Rumors have it that HTC could also reveal another, more powerful variant of the U11 EYEs at the event. It might come with the Snapdragon 660 chipset under the hood, with some claiming it could also sport 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage.. Thanks to Evan Blass, we also have a good idea of what the HTC U11 EYEs could look like. He posted alleged images of the device on Twitter , which leave little to the imagination — check them out below.. Based on the images, the U11 EYEs could look a lot like the U11 Plus , which is a good thing in my opinion. It has a clean front without branding and a minimalistic glass back that’s eye-catching thanks to its reflective nature. The images also reveal that the device may have a dual-camera setup on the front, which makes sense given its name.. Read next: HTC’s 2017 revenues were its lowest in 13 years. The Snapdragon 652-powered U11 EYEs is expected to retail for CNY 2,599 (around $400), while the beefed-up variant with the Snapdragon 660 chipset will set you back CNY 3,599 (around $555). They are said to go on sale in Hong Kong on January 17, followed by a release in China and Taiwan soon after. No word on when —. we’ll see the HTC EYEs in Western markets..

HTC U11 EYEs with dual selfie-cam could be unveiled soon. Home > Phones >. Phone news > HTC phone news. HTC: 'We'll definitely be releasing a dual-camera phone' in 2018. HTC U11+ vs HTC U11: What's the difference?. HTC U11 Life vs HTC U11: What's the difference?. HTC may not be done with smartphone releases for 2017, or we may already have a glimpse at what to expect come the turn of the New Year. The Taiwanese smartphone manufacturer is expected to go back to its 2014 roots and resurrect the Eye branding for its next smartphone, the U11 EYEs.. The phone has currently been known as the Ocean Harmony, but notable and usually-reliable Twitter tipster Evan Blass has recently tweeted to say it will be known as "the HTC U11 EYEs". The Eye branding on the HTC Desire Eye referred to the fact it had a 13-megapixel camera on the front, making it a serious selfie shooter.. Blass has referred to the new device as 'EYEs', indicating it may in fact have two front-facing cameras. HTC has adopted dual-lens cameras before, but only on the rear.. Blass hasn't revealed any specs or features of the phone, however GizmoChina has reported that the phone has 3C certification in China (China's equivalent of the American FCC filings) where it has appeared with some specs.. They include a 5.99-inch, 18:9 display with 2160 x 1080 resolution, Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 and Snapdragon 660 processors with 4GB and 6GB of RAM, and 64GB and 128GB of storage respectively. It also says the phone will have two 5-megapixel front-facing cameras, giving some weight to the EYEs branding.. On the back there's expected to be a 12-megapixel single-lens camera with OIS. Pricing for the U11 EYEs is predicted to be between $400 and $550 depending on configuration, but it's difficult to say at such this early stage. However, since the device has received certification in China, it may not be long until we hear official details..

A new version of HTC U11 has been launched: HTC U11 Eyes , with a more affordable price tag and lower-end specs. We think it is time to compare it with the costlier version of the flagship, U11 Plus , which is exactly the opposite: a more powerful variant with a more expensive price tag. Is it worth choosing the higher-end version of the mid-range variant is enough for your needs? Let’s discover it with a HTC U11 Eyes vs HTC U11 Plus comparison of their specs.. The big difference between HTC U11 Eyes and U11 Plus is obviously in the hardware department. The first has a Snapdragon 652 SoC, while the second has a Snapdragon 835 which is a. much more powerful chipset, as we are talking about a midrange SoC vs the best flagship SoC currently in the market. HTC U11 Plus has also more RAM in its most expensive variant (6 GB). So the Plus version is much faster and smoother in every scenario. The rest of the specs and potentialities are not so different, even though the U11 Plus looks slightly better in each of them. The display has a higher resolution, the main camera is slightly better, and there is also a better certification for water-resistance in the Plus model. there’s an element in the EYEs which is not present in the U11+ — the dual front camera with face recognition.. Snapdragon 652 Revisited: Does It Make Sense To Use A Two Year Old Chipset In A $500 HTC Device in 2018?. The real advantage of HTC U11 Eyes is the price, as it has been launched in China at about $512, while its opponent has a listing price of €800 (almost $1,000). But note that it is possible to find the standard HTC U11 model with Snapdragon 835 (the one with bezels) at less than €600. It means that at this moment U11 Eyes is still not a great option to buy..

HTC U11 EYEs Specs, Release Date: New Leaks Hint at Front-facing Dual Camera Setup and More (Photo: Reuters/Tyrone Siu/Illustration/File Photo) A HTC "U11" smartphone is displayed in this illustration photo taken August 1, 2017.. Share on facebook Share on twitter. Share Email Print Share Tweet Pin Linkedin Google+ Reddit. By Janna Dela Cruz , Christian Post Contributor | Dec 11, 2017 3:02 PM. HTC is reportedly working on a new version of its flagship, the HTC U11, and this particular model will be appreciated by those who are looking to take their selfies to the next level.. The device in question is called HTC U11 EYEs, according to the ever-reliable tech insider Evan Blass. This is the smartphone that goes by the codename Ocean Harmony that was reported before the HTC U11 was made official. Obviously, HTC decided not to release it alongside the flagship for reasons unknown.. Based on the handset's name, it could be taking inspiration from HTC's Desire EYE, whose main selling point is the strikingly huge 13 MP camera on its front panel.. believes that the HTC U11 EYEs might be getting the same treatment although the plural form in the smartphone's name gives the impression that that there will be more than one module on the device's front panel.. Indeed, this is what the HTC U11 EYEs showed during its 3C certification. The handset stayed true to its name carrying a pair of 5 MP front-facing cameras.. This makes the HTC U11 EYEs the first device from the company to come with dual cameras on the front as HTC usually packed its top of the line offerings with a rear-facing setup.. Other key specifications and features revealed during its 3C visit there include a 6-inch display with a tall 18:9 aspect ratio making for minimal bezels. On the back is a 12 MP camera with Optical Image Stabilization (OIS).. The octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor will be its main power source paired with 4 to 6 GB of random-access memory (RAM) and 64 o 128 GB storage.. HTC's latest mobile offering is expected to be unveiled this month, which means it won't be long before official details roll around.. Share on facebook Share on twitter.

HTC U11 Eyes: The Mid-Range Smartphone With A Special Focus on Selfies and Battery Life HTC official website Promotional picture for the HTC U11 Eyes.. Share on facebook Share on twitter. Share Email Print Share Tweet Pin Linkedin Google+ Reddit. By Shannon Azares , Christian Post Contributor | Jan 16, 2018 12:52 PM. Recent reports have revealed that soon after HTC's announcement that they will be bringing back dual front cameras, a new mid-tier phone called the HTC U11 Eyes was unveiled by the tech giant. It features specs that are great for selfies and indicate the long battery life of the smartphone.. According to reports , the HTC U11 Eyes is mainly meant for fans who love to take a selfie as it feature dual front cameras with 5-megapixel and HDR support. Furthermore, a bokeh mode has been included to the package which will alow users to adjust the depth of field in photographs, either before the picture is taken or on the photo itself. The mid-tier phone also features the same "Liquid Design" seen in the original U11 but with a few disadvantages in terms of the internal specs.. reveal that the HTC U11 Eyes features a two-year-old Snapdragon 652 processor, a 6-inch and near bezel-less screen, 12 megapixels for the rear camera, fingerprint sensor at the back of the smartphone, and edge sense. HTC also threw in several flagship specs, including water and dust resistance. The whole package has been reported to be powered by a massive 3,930mAh battery. Aside from what has been mentioned, HTC also claimed that unlike Apple's Face ID, the HTC U11 Eyes will be able to distinguish between a real face and a photo for the face unlock. It will also be able to recognize users no matter what accessory they were on their faces.. Fans have noted that the HTC U11 Eyes lacks several features, such as the 3.5mm headphone jack. Regardless, some were impressed with the design and focus on selfies. Unfortunately, the HTC U11 Eyes has been announced for a limited release in Hong Kong, with no word on a global release. It will cost $500 for the 64GB variant.. Share on facebook Share on twitter. Share Email Print Share Tweet Pin Linkedin Google+ Reddit. Most Popular Sponsored Article MUST READ.

HTC U11 EYEs unveiled with 18:9 display, dual front cameras, and 3930mAh battery. The U11 EYEs features the largest battery on an HTC smartphone yet.. Renders of the HTC U11 EYEs leaked late last week, and the phone is now official. The highlight of the phone is a dual 5MP camera setup at the front with f/2.2 lenses, HDR, 80-degree field of view, and portrait mode. The U11 EYEs also has a 3930mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0, which is the largest battery on an HTC smartphone yet.. Other specs include a 6.0-inch 18:9 display with a resolution of 2160 x 1080, Snapdragon 652, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, microSD slot, 12MP UltraPixel 3 rear camera with OIS, PDAF, dual-LED flash, and 4K video recording, Ip67 dust and water resistance, and USB-C connectivity. The U11 EYEs retains the Edge Sense feature introduced in the U11 , giving you the ability to squeeze the sides of the frame to perform actions like launching the Google Assistant or opening the camera.. On the software front, the device is running Oreo out of the box, unlike earlier rumors that hinted at Nougat. However, like recent HTC phones, there's no 3.5mm jack, so you'll have to switch to wireless audio or use a dongle to hook up your wired audio gear.. The U11 EYES will go on sale later this month in China for the equivalent of $465 (¥2,999), and will hit Taiwan on February for NT$14,900 ($505). There's no information regarding availability outside of Asia, but we'll let you know once that changes. In the meantime, what are your thoughts on HTC's latest phone?

Following the launched of the HTC U11 and HTC U11 Life in 2017, it looks like HTC may planning to start 2018 with a third device in its U11 lineup.. Images of the HTC U11 EYEs have leaked out. The device has a colorful backside like the other U11 devices, but it's got some pretty significant design changes, too. For example, the fingerprint reader on the HTC U11 EYEs is below the phone's rear camera, rather than below the screen.. The HTC U11 EYEs appears to have slimmer bezels around its display that the HTC U11 and HTC U11 Life. Also of note is that the screen appears to have rounded corners.. HTC U11 EYEs (Harmony): 6" FHD+ (1080 x 2160) Super LCD3, SD652 octa core, 4GB/64GB (+microSD), USB-C, 3930mAh, IP67, Android Nougat, Edge Sense. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) January 12, 2018. According to Evan Blass, the specs of the HTC U11 Life include a 6-inch 2160x1080 Super LCD3 screen, octa-core Snapdragon 652 processor, 4GB of RAM, and a 3,930mAh battery. It's got 64GB of built-in storage along with a microSD card slot if you need more storage. There's also a USB-C port to recharge the phone and IP67 water and dust resistance.. The device is expected to launch on January 15th at a price of ￥3299 ($510 USD) with Android Nougat in tow.. This leaked HTC U11 EYEs looks like it's got some nice tweaks from previous U11 models, offering smaller bezels and a rear fingerprint reader. The price might be a bit tough for some to swallow, though, especially when you've got devices like the OnePlus 5T, which has a Snapdragon 835 and 6GB of RAM for ￥200 ($31) more..

HTC U11 Eyes’ Dual Front Cameras, Large Battery Take Center Stage. Sony’s New Xperia Budget-Friendly Handsets Offer Decent.... HTC U11 Eyes’ Dual Front Cameras, Large Battery Take Center Stage. HTC has struggled to rise to prominence in the global smartphone market. But it keeps trying, this time with a new smartphone it’s calling the HTC U11 Eyes. The name refers to the handset’s dual front-facing cameras that HTC says, will deliver “amazing selfies” to go along with its support for facial scanning.. The HTC U11 Eyes Android handset comes with a 6-inch display and runs on a Snapdragon 625 processor. Like other recent HTC models, the company has emphasized the U11 Eyes’ advanced speaker support. But with the Samsung Galaxy S9 around the corner and reports of other handset makers planning big updates during February’s Mobile World Congress, the U11 Eyes might end up another face in the smartphone crowd. Read on to learn more about HTC U11 Eyes.. Dual Front Cameras Are the Main Attraction. The HTC U11 Eyes earns its name from its dual front-facing cameras. The cameras both have 5-megapixel sensor and come with an “HDR Boost” feature for improving color accuracy. HTC said that the cameras are ideal for selfies and can adjust depth-of-field. The dual front-facing cameras are complemented by a 12-megapixel rear-facing lens that offers “UltraSpeed” autofocus for improved performance on moving subjects.. The U11 Eyes Does Away With Physical Home Butten. In a move likely designed to help HTC keep its costs down, the company didn’t spend big on an advanced design for the U11 Eyes. Instead, the handset comes with bulky bezels above and below the screen that house the earpiece, cameras, and other components. However, there’s no physical home button on the front of the HTC U11 Eyes. So users will need to rely on a virtual home button to maneuver around the Android operating system’s features.. The HTC U11 Eyes comes with a facial scanning feature the company calls Face Unlock. To activate the feature, users need to squeeze the sides of the handset. However, HTC’s Face Unlock is a 2D scanner, which means it’s not nearly as accurate or hacker-resistant as the 3D scanner in Apple’s Face ID feature.. Squeeze the Sides to Launch Apps. HTC’s U11 Eyes ships with support for the company’s Edge Sense features. This allows users to launch apps by squeezing the smartphone’s sides. Edge Sense can also be used to activate a voice assistant, take photos and more.. The 6-Inch Screen Delivers Full-HD Resolution. The HTC U11 Eyes ships with a 6-inch screen featuring a full-HD+ resolution of 2,160 by 1,080 pixels. It’s also protected by Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3, a somewhat older version of the display covering that reduces the incidence of screen cracking and shattering.. A Snapdragon 625 Powers the U11 Eyes. Those hoping for late-model processing power in the HTC U11 Eyes will be disappointed. HTC opted for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625, which is a power-efficient 64-bit, eight-core CPU, rather than a late model Snapdragon 835.. Thus it might not work as well the most resource-intensive apps and games. The smartphone comes with 64GB of onboard storage and 4GB of memory.. HTC U11 Eyes Packs a Large-Capacity Battery. The HTC U11 Eyes has one of the biggest battery packs on the market at 3,930mAh. That’s enough to deliver more than 28 hours of talk time on a single charge, according to HTC. The battery also comes with Quick Charge 3.0.. Its Liquid and Dust Resistant Level Is Good. According to HTC, the U11 Eyes supports the IP67 standard for resistance liquid and dust intrusion. However, with some of the latest handsets supporting the IP68 standard, the IP67 support might prove to be less appealing to more discriminating buyers.. HTC Touts U11 Eyes Sound Features. Like previous HTC smartphones, the U11 Eyes has several audio features that the company believes delivers extra value to users. The handset ships with the HTC USonic, a sonar-like feature that optimizes sound quality during calls. The smartphone also comes with active noise cancelation and speakers that have been optimized with “hi-res audio.”. This Android Handset Carries a Midrange Price. HTC hasn’t shed much light on its marketing plans for the U11 Eyes. The company has only confirmed for now that it will be available in China for $500. Reports suggest the handset will soon make its way to other countries around the world for about the same price, though an exact shipment date hasn’t yet been announced..

HTC U11 EYEs With Dual Front Cameras Launched. 157.9 x 74.99 x 8.5 mm. shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter. After leaking the device in its entirety on its own official website, HTC has launched the HTC U11 EYEs in Taiwan and China at a price of CNY 3299 (Rs. The device will go on sale from the 25th of January with pre-orders starting today. Back in November, HTC gave in to the industry trend of no headphone jack and thin bezels with the HTC U11+ and now, the HTC U11 EYEs has a face unlock feature.. HTC U11 EYEs has a 6 inch Super LCD3 display with a 2160 x 1080 px resolution.. Under the hood, the U11 EYEs is powered by the Snapdragon 652 chipset, along with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage. The fingerprint sensor is placed on the back of the phone as it has thin bezels around the display. The smartphone also has an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance.. The smartphone also has the largest ever battery found on an HTC device with a massive 3930 mAh capacity which charges via a USB C port.. The smartphone will run Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box with HTC’s own Sense UI on top.. Like a lot of smartphones from HTC, it has the Edge Sense technology which allows users to squeeze the frame of the phone to launch a particular app or action. This feature can be customised to launch a specific action while inside a certain app.. The HTC U11 EYEs has a 12MP “UltraPixel 3” primary camera with an f/1.7 aperture, OIS and “UltraSpeed” autofocus. HTC has revealed a DxOMark score of 90, which is exactly the same as what the HTC U11 received, which probably means that it is the same camera. To the front is a dual 5MP camera setup which will work together to create a bokeh effect. The dual-camera setup also supports Portrait Mode and AR Snapchat-like stickers.. the HTC U11 EYEs might not make its way to India, especially considering that the previous two devices from HTC never saw the light of day in the Indian market. However, if HTC does plan to launch it in India, it will have to priced much lower than Rs. 32000 to stand any chance in the competitive mid-range segment.. shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter.

HTC U11 EYEs has a big battery and a dual front camera. Android , big-tech-companies , Gadgets , HTC , htc-u11-eyes , smartphone , Tech. By Stan Schroeder 2018-01-15 12:57:05 UTC. Every product here is independently selected by Mashable journalists. If you buy something featured, we may earn an affiliate commission which helps support our work.. After U11 and U11+ , HTC has a new phone in its flagship line, the U11 EYEs.. This one, however, is more of a mid-ranger with a focus on selfie photography. With a 12-megapixel UltraPixel 3 camera on the back and dual 5-megapixel cameras on the front, it should be a great companion for anyone who takes lots of photos.. SEE ALSO: HTC's new Vive Pro is for hardcore VR fans. The dual front cameras allow for portrait mode-style selfies with a bokeh effect that can be adjusted after the photo is captured. The camera on the back comes with electronic and optical image stabilization and UltraSpeed autofocus.. Just like the HTC U11+, the HTC U11 EYEs also has a 3,930mAh battery, a similar glossy design and IP67 certified water and dust resistance. HTC's Edge Sense tech, which lets you launch certain features by squeezing your phone, is also on board.. The rest of the specs, however, are weaker than those of the flagship. The HTC U11 EYEs is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Its LCD screen sports a lower, 2,160x1,080 pixel resolution, and the speaker is mono instead of stereo. And forget about connecting your old wired headphones to it; there's no headphone jack on this one.. On the software side, the HTC U11 EYEs is running on Android 7.1 and HTC Sense UI.. The HTC U11 EYEs will go on sale in China for roughly $465; there's no word on availability in the western markets.. WATCH: Razer has built a smartphone-powered laptop.

Just as expected , HTC today introduced its newest U11 smartphone.. The HTC U11 EYEs features dual front-facing cameras, both of which are 5-megapixel sensors with f/2.2 apertures. Using these front cameras, you get features like bokeh to give your selfies a blurry background, face unlock, and 1080p video capture.. Around back, the U11 EYEs boasts a 12-megapixel UltraPixel 3 camera. HTC says that this camera's got an f/1.7 aperture, optical image stabilization, dual LED flash, and 4K video capture. Below that rear camera is a fingerprint reader, which is a change from the HTC U11 Life and HTC U11 which both had front fingerprint readers.. Speaking of those other U11 phones, the HTC U11 EYEs features a liquid metal rear like the one found on those other devices. Also included here is HTC's Edge Sense feature that will let you perform actions like taking a photo or capturing a screenshot by squeezing the sides of the device.. Other features of the HTC U11 EYEs include a Snapdragon 652 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a microSD card slot, a 3,930mAh battery, USB-C, and an IP67-rated body that'll resist dust and water. The phone runs Android 8.0 with HTC's Sense UI on a 6-inch 2160x1080 display with an 18:9 aspect ratio. One other detail of the HTC U11 EYEs worth noting is that there's no 3.5mm headphone jack to be found here.. The HTC U11 EYEs will launch soon in China for ¥3299 ($512 USD).. With the U11 EYEs, HTC looks to be jumping on some of the trendy features we've seen in mobile lately, like tall screens with slim bezels and face unlocking. That makes the U11 EYEs exciting for fans of HTC, though folks may be disappointed at this model's mid-range spec list. Perhaps we'll see similar features in HTC's next flagship, too..

HTC ‘Harmony’ tipped to be marketed under U11 EYEs brand, but what might that entail?. Adrian Diaconescu December 7, 2017 11:52 am. Focused on turning a profit rather than selling a boatload of phones with razor-thin margins, HTC tightened up its mobile product portfolio, but once again missed all financial targets this year .. Still, the Taiwanese makers of the world’s first Android handset are not looking to throw in the towel, planning five or six own-brand 2018 releases in addition to helping Google shape up the next pocket-sized Pixel generation.. It’s unclear if that number includes a handset rumored under the Ocean Harmony codename a while back , which legendary leaker Evan Blass just “confirmed” on Twitter as the upcoming HTC U11 EYEs.. Unless that’s a (random) prank, HTC is expected to revive all of a sudden a (sub) brand from 2014. A not very popular one too, attached as a suffix to confusing derivations of Desire and One M8 devices .. Remember that a few years ago the company had a similarly branded handset, the Desire EYE.. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) December 7, 2017. Needless to stress we have no idea how the U11 EYEs, Desire Eye and One M8 Eye could possibly be connected, although the latter two were largely focused on providing unique camera features and a special photography-taking experience.. Thus, one might reasonably predict a dual camera HTC arrangement comeback on this bizarrely named U11 EYEs. That’s merely an assumption, and we don’t even know if the new phone is set to see daylight this month, as previously speculated, or early next year.

Here is everything we know about the HTC U11 Eyes. htc u11 eyes Design htc u11 eyes news eye black htc u11 eyes news red htc u11 eyes news blue Specs Price and availability. Last year, HTC brought us three smartphones — the HTC U11 and U11 Plus, along with the HTC U11 Life .. While the company has yet to confirm details, rumors hint at a new addition to the lineup known as the HTC U11 Eyes. recent tweet by Venture Beat’s Evan Blass includes a fair amount of details concerning what to expect from the midrange smartphone.. Here’s everything we know about the HTC U11 Eyes.. The HTC U11 Eyes reportedly features a 6-inch screen with 1,080 x 2,160 Super LCD3 display. With photos by way of Blass, it comes in three different color variants — black, silver, and red. To the far right of the device are two front-facing cameras that resemble a pair of “eyes” — which is most likely why the device has its name.. On the back, you’ll find a single camera with dual-LED and dual-tone flash. Right below it is a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner and on the bottom is a USB-type C port for fast charging.. HTC released a device back in 2014 under the “Eye” brand as well, known as the Desire Eye. While it’s clearly far more dated, it’s easy to see a resemblance between the two. This time around, the U11 Eyes looks to be made out of metal and glass with rounded corners and thin bezels. It will also include Edge Sense — featured on its predecessors as well — which allows you to squeeze the bottom edges of the device to perform different shortcuts.. Under the hood, the HTC U11 could include a Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor along with a 3,930mAh battery. In terms of storage, there will be 4GB of RAM and expandable storage of up to 64GB via a MicroSD card. It also has an IP67 certification when it comes to water and dust resistance. Some users may be disappointed to know that it will run Android Nougat instead of Oreo.. The U11 Eyes is expected to launch on January 15 and will reportedly be priced at $510. That date is also the same one listed on the official invitation for HTC’s upcoming press event in China. — which included the keyword “Eye” — first spotted by PlayfulDroid ..
