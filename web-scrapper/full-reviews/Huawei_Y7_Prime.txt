Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. Itâs measured in âpixels per inchâ, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Features: Hyperlapse, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 1400 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the deviceâs hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card â most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

Yan Souza, 06 Feb 2018 Just bought this phone. So far, it's being a great user experience. Any good advice for a first time huawei user?. so my Huawei y7 prime had some water fall on it by some I mean some and I fixed it now the screen just glitches it goes up and down and shakes all around. Just used for the first week and felt like smashing this phone into the floor. I'm not a gamer or power intensive user, but I do use this phone for work. Generally this phone lags and apps freezes despite RAM usage remain 1.6GB/3GB. The phone doesn't have a Gyroscope, so if you have plans on using any apps that needs this sensor like Google Camera for photosphere and panorama, please move on to another phone. Speaking of camera, super slow on stock camera and alternative cameras. Such a sucky device from Huawei with apps freezing on and off. Perhaps they should have released this phone with an Android One rom instead of this childplay emui 5.1.. This phone also known on argentina as "Huawei GW Metal"... and the Huawei Y6 II compact is "Huawei GW".... i wonder why so many names in diferents countries... please huawei not follow the confusing path of samsung (j1, j1 prime, j7, j7 neo, j7 prime...). Oogle boogle, 01 Feb 2018 My phone starts to get hot fast, what should I do? same here ..what did you do? i'm planning to return my phone ..i just bought it today :(. It's really great phone,, whenever i need to change my Samsung note 3 , I'm going to buy y7 prime, ,, Huawei is much better than Samsung, I used to have both of them.. Overall a great phone, but I keep having problems with apps freezing up on my. my Microsoft office apps I need to use for work. Anyone else have this problem and find a solution?. outstanding battery from my experience, since it used 720p resolution which for 5.5 iinch phone is more than good enough. in their build in battery manager, i only use low resolution power saving (the mild power saver), it keeps the running system only used 300-400 mb ram. compare to my brother j7+ and nubia m2 lite both have running 1.8gb-1.6gb ram for their system. keep in mind i even using their build in screen lock app who could change hd wallpaper everytime i open the phone, custom launcher and several social apps turn on. it gave me almost 1.5 day normal usage between social med and gaming. oh and one more thing, their build in phone manager is the best, cache cleaner, virus swiping and background app killer so you dont need to install third app cleaner.. plz i have y7 prime its a top phone bu i have a problem with the snap i cant hear my videos and even when i send them any advices ! plz does anyone suffer like me. Is there upcoming software updates or it is upgradable to OREO?. Anonymous, 07 Feb 2018 Me too.. Same here, the memory looks good and Vodafone knock off ÃÂ40 if u switch. dhadmahal, 06 Feb 2018 can you teach me how to use screen shot? shortcut probably.. I'm a first time user Huawei.. more Just press power button and volume down button at the same time. Or you can swipe down the top of screen( to show the menu where you toggle wifi,bluetooth etc on/off) and you will see "screenshot" there. You can also record the activities on your screen. Same as the second method and you will see the screen recording. Last feature in terms of screen capturing that I know is the "scrollshot" feature. Simply press power button key ang volume down key at the same time,and then at the lower right part of screen you will see the "scrollshot" option. It will scroll down autimatically and you just have to tap it when the screen reaches the part where you want it to end (mostly used when screen capturing lone messages). feeling relaxed and you feel some thing stable in you hands..... not many phones like this great phone. Mouyad., 01 Feb 2018 I am planning to buy it; and advice?. Yan Souza, 06 Feb 2018 Just bought this phone. So far, it's being a great user experience. more about how many days will the battery of your phones lasts Sir/Madam if it's on standby?

Find out in our review here.. Dimensions: 153.6 x 76.4 x 8.4 mm; Weight: 165 grams. 5.5-inch HD IPS LCD Display with 2.5D curved glass (@267 PPI Pixel density).

Sensors: Fingerprint (Rear Mounted), accelerometer, ambient light, proximity, compass. Huawei Y7 Prime Price in Nepal: Rs. What do I like about the. The massive 4000mAh is remarkable on the phone, which provides a prolonged backup. The fingerprint on the device is snappy suited with the capability to unlock almost instantaneously. The device display is of HD (720p) resolution offering a poor pixel density for the price. The Snapdragon 435 chipset equipped on the phone is an average performer. To charge the massive battery it does not come with quick charge technology. The device heats up a lot even on the normal usage. The device lacks gyro sensor, which cuts the privilege to play VR games and watch 360-degree videos. Huawei Y7 Prime and the competition. The launch of new smartphones often brings excitement among the smartphone enthusiasts. And like always, a new mid-ranger from Huawei, dubbed with Huawei Y7 Prime brought a similar feeling among us. Tagged with the price of Rs.24,900 Huawei Y7 Prime comes with the primary focus on the battery. Huawei is renowned for the decent specs and superior performance even on low and mid-range phones providing a proper value for money and for this reason, the brand has a stronghold on Nepali smartphone market. But will this newbie help the Huawei to continue the trend? Will this device provide the promised specs and performance? Letâs find out in this review.. Huawei Y7 Prime has a plastic back enclosed inside a metallic frame. However, the device has been cleverly and convincingly designed and colored to give the looks and feel of a metallic body.. The device felt premium on the hold but because of the metallic edges, the device frequently slipped through my hands on the use. The design also includes a generous amount of bezel on the chin, which is so unconvincing for the phone with on-screen buttons.. Y7 Prime carries a 5.5-inch IPS display with 2.5D curved glass toppings. The display lacks protection and I opted to use a screen protector so I could not go to feel the curvy edges on the phone. Gaming and multimedia is not quite enjoyable on the phone with a huge screen and lower resolution and Y7 Prime has not been an exception. So the 720p resolution has been the major disappointment on the phone.. The phone has power and volume rockers on the right and SIM+SDcard slot on the left. There is a place for the 3.5mm headphone jack dwelling on the top edge of the phone. For the charging, the device has micro USB 2.0 port on the bottom edge with speaker grills on the left and right. However, sound output only comes from the right grill. The output sound quality is decent and loud. On the top, there is a tiny LED, which blinks alerting about the notifications.. Talking about the sensors, Huawei Y7 Prime inherits Fingerprint, accelerometer, ambient light, proximity and compass sensors. The fingerprint sensor is the most impressive piece of hardware on the phone, which resides on the back. The Fingerprint on the phone is accurate and unlocks the device without a hitch. In addition, it can be used to snap photos, read notifications and swipe files in the gallery. And the presence of ambient light sensor saves the trouble of readjusting the brightness under different lighting conditions. However, gyro sensor is missing on the phone, whose absence will be duly felt on the use.. On the software side, Huawei Y7 Prime comes with EMUI 5.1 based on the latest Android Nougat. The UI offers an option to select an app drawer or to leave the apps scattered on the home screen. For the rest of the features, the UI is nothing out of ordinary and does inherit some unnecessary bloatware.. Huawei Y7 Prime Review - Software Screenshots. Powering the Huawei Y7 Prime is mediocre Snapdragon 435 chipset. Clocked at 1.4GHz speed, Snapdragon 435 is an underpowered chipset and the performance on this device is not the best you will get in this price bracket.. On my use, the device performed well with low-end games and multitasking with light apps. However, on the high-end games, there were stutters and drop in frame rates usurping my fun in the most cases. The experience on low-end games was not good either with the phone heating up frequently. While playing low-end games, the phone heated up as early as 15 minutes of use. Even with the apps like Facebook and Instagram, the device heated up in half an hour or earlier. Though the phone has 3GB of RAM, with the RAM usage of 2GB or more, the device froze most of the time.. Moving on to the camera, Huawei Y7 Prime embraces 12MP camera on the back. The shots taken from the rear camera packs a sufficient amount of details and replicates a natural color tone. However, I felt shutter lags while taking photos. In addition, there were no impressive changes with the images taken with HDR on and off. The images from the selfie shooter were not bad either. Bringing out most of the details, the 8MP front camera produces social media ready images and the beautify mode built in with the camera app provides a stronger assist. Even on the low lights, the camera performs well with minimal noises and grains. On the videography side, the phone is capable of shooting Full-HD (1080p) at 30fps frame rate. The phone also has inbuilt Slo-mo and Time-lapse features on the videography side.. For the connectivity, Huawei Y7 Prime packs 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, A-GPS, FM Radio, Bluetooth v4.1 and micro USB 2.0. The device is also OTG compatible, which can be used to transfer the battery juice to another device in addition to transferring data and files. Though the device is capable of running Dual-SIM on standby, the phone comes with an internal storage of 32GB with one fourth of the space devoured by the system firmware. So in the case of insufficiency, microSD card will be the option with the expandable capability up to 256GB. But since the MicroSD card uses the SIM2 slot for this purpose, which cuts you from the privilege to use dual-SIM on the standby.. The battery is the USP of the phone with the capacity of 4000mAh. As promised, the phone provides a decent amount of backup. Even while playing high-end games rigorously with full brightness and Wi-Fi on, the phone lasted for around six hours. The device backed me up for a day and a half on the normal usage. Yet there were, even more, options to prolong backup and optimize battery life. However, the phone is sluggish in the matter of charging. The phone lacks quick charging and takes a little more than 3 hours to get the charging fully done.. To sum it up, with a little potential on the camera, Huawei Y7 Prime has nothing best to offer except for its massive battery. And in the similar price bracket, there are many other smartphones, which supersedes the Huawei Y7 Prime in every possible aspect including the battery. So I see nothing remarkable to suggest our followers go for Huawei Y7 Prime.. 5.5-inch Full HD IPS Display (401ppi). 5.5-inch Full HD PLS Display (401ppi). 1.6Ghz Octacore Exynos 7870 (Cortex A53, 14nm). 1.3Ghz Octacore MT6753 (Cortex A53, 28nm).

Huawei Y7 Prime Unboxing, Quick Review: Another Bang-for-the-buck Phone From Huawei?. 5.5-inch HD IPS display, 1280 x 720 resolution, 2.5D curved glass. Android 7.0 Nougat, with EMUI 5.1. Huaweiâs been on the offensive the past few months. After outing their excellent Nova 2i a few weeks ago and the announcement of their new flagship phone, the Chinese company is now setting its sights on the budget part of the market. With their GR5 2017 starting to grow long in the tooth , Huawei has turned to a new weapon in the form of the Y7 Prime. While the Y7 Prime doesnât have fancy features like dual cameras and an 18:9 display, it still offers a solid set of specs at a relatively reasonable price point .. Huaweiâs taken to using distinctive packaging to differentiate their smartphone lineups, with light blue boxes denoting members of their budget line. The Y7 Prime is no exception to that, and came to us in a light blue box that had the phoneâs name written in the front.. Related Posts: Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus Unboxing, Initial Review: Theâ¦ Bang-For-The-Buck Mid-Range Quick Comparo: Xiaomiâ¦ Ulefone Power 3 Is Another Big-batteried,â¦. Once you open the box, youâll see the phone, a freebie silicone back case, USB charger, USB cable plus a pair of headphones.. The Y7 Prime looks and feels fantastic, especially considering its price range. The phone feels good in the hands and features a mostly metal body. Itâs not a unibody design though, as you can see in the pictures, and weâre positive that the top and bottom strips at the rear are plastic and are where the antennas are.. Despite that the phone feels pretty premium, and we canât find a single fault in the way that the phone was put together. The Y7 Prime features a slight curve at the edges of the phone, and has rounded corners for better ergonomics.. The fingerprint scanner sits right below the 12-megapixel rear camera which has a single LED flash unit placed on its right side. Both the power and volume buttons are located on the right of the phone, while the hybrid SIM/microSD tray sit on the right side. The 3.5mm jack is located on the top, while the USB port and speaker grilles are located on the bottom.. The front of the phone features a 5.5-inch HD IPS panel, with 2.5D curved glass. The 8-megapixel front-facing camera sits right above the display.. As for display quality, the display of the phone looks good for what it is. Granted it doesnât have the same pixel density as a full HD panel, but it still looks great nonetheless, and is good enough for most users. The fingerprint scanner is fast and accurate, which is pretty much par for the course for Huawei phones nowadays.. Inside the phone sits a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor, paired with 3GB RAM and 32GB of expandable storage. Hardware isnât exactly what youâd call the best nowadays, but for most users that the Y7 Prime is targeting, thatâs more than enough. Android Nougat is on board as well, along with Huaweiâs home-grown EMUI 5.1 UI. Interestingly the phone has a 4000mAh battery which should be able to power the Y7 Prime for quite a while before it dies.. As for pricing, the Y7 Prime is currently priced at Php 9990 and is available to buy today.. Previous iPhone X Lands Unofficially In PH Via Widget City, Priced At 100K.

Home Tech News Latest Phones Reviews Pricelists About PTG. Huawei Y7 Prime Review: An Ace in Battery Life!. Home âº Reviews âº Huawei Y7 Prime Review: An Ace in Battery Life!. Hands on with the Huawei Y7 Prime!. Design & Build Quality Display and User Interface Huawei Y7 Prime Performance Huawei Y7 Prime Camera Review Audio and Multimedia Connectivity and Sensors Huawei Y7 Prime Battery Life. Huawei is known for producing smartphones with long lasting batteries. The Huawei Y7 Prime is a testament to this with its 4000mAh battery .. Surprisingly, it also has a sleek design and decent performance. After using the device for several weeks, here is my personal review:. The Huawei Y7 Prime has metal on the back.. The Huawei Y7 Prime has a metal back plate that provides a premium feeling when the device is held in one hand. However, the sides are made out of polycarbonate plastic â a necessary trade-off for good cellular signal reception.. On the front of the device is its 5.5 inch display. The 2.5D curved edges make the phone look sleek but the bezels could have been trimmed a bit. Still, swiping from the sides feel smooth.. I accidentally dropped the device once from waist high down to a concrete floor. There are a few scrapes on its upper right corner but it still works perfectly fine.. Left to right: Home screen, apps, shortcuts, Settings, Themes and SMS.. At first, I found the 5.5 inch HD display of the Huawei Y7 Prime to be short on brightness. However, this was because I was coming from the brighter Huawei GR3 2017 which also boasts a higher full HD resolution. Nevertheless, the former is still legible even under direct sunlight .. It runs on Android 7.0 Nougat with the companyâs EMUI 5.1 software on top. All app icons and widgets are laid out on the home screens by default but an app drawer can be enabled in the settings.. I especially like the Eye Comfort feature of the software. This filters out the blue light from the screen to make it more comfortable to look at especially while reading during night time.. The Huawei Y7 Prime runs on a 1.4GHz octa core Snapdragon 435 processor with 3GB of RAM. This belongs to the entry level series of chips from Qualcomm but its quality shows in the performance of the device.. Scrolling across home screens or down through webpages is smooth and fluid. Gaming performance is decent too with minimal stutters in heavy games and virtually flawless rendering of casual games.. I enjoyed playing Asphalt 8 Airborne on the Huawei Y7 Prime with the graphics set at High. Mobile Legends also runs smoothly but there are jagged lines and blurry graphics â Iâm guessing itâs the game and not the device.. While photography is not its biggest strength, the Huawei Y7 Prime can still take good quality pictures and videos with ample lighting. Low light shots are acceptable too.. Photos taken using the 12 Megapixel rear camera have natural colors but the dynamic range can be improved. It had a problem focusing on the subject I tap on but this has been fixed in a software update two weeks after I got the device.. Meanwhile, the 8 Megapixel front camera can also produce social media worthy selfies even in low light thanks to the built-in screen flash function. Of course, itâs better if you take your selfies during the day.. Playing Asphalt 8 Airborne on the Huawei Y7 Prime.. I watched 4 episodes of Marvelâs The Punisher on the Huawei Y7 Prime at its native 720p resolution. The videos play smoothly but with a slight stutter when resumed from a screen off state.. The audio from the loudspeaker could use an increase in volume but it remains clear at 100% volume. Listening to music is more enjoyable using the included earphones. Itâs pretty good in quality with a single button and a microphone but itâs not the in-ear type which Iâm more used to.. The Huawei Y7 Prime is a dual SIM smartphone. Both SIMs can connect to 4G LTE networks but not at the same time.. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and hotspot functions work well. Meanwhile, GPS can get a lock on the phoneâs location swiftly even inside our house.. However, the device lacks a gyroscope which is essential for immersive AR and VR applications. Its sensors include an accelerometer, ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, orientation sensor, magnetometer and of course, a fast and reliable fingerprint sensor .. Battery usage statistics of the Huawei Y7 Prime.. Battery life is where the Huawei Y7 Prime shines the most. On minimal use, its 4000mAh battery lasts for two days! It can even be extended further if the various battery saving features are turned on.. However, a straight session of playing games with the device can only last for 5-6 hours before needing a re-charge. Heavy usage will also shorten the battery life to a day but almost always with spare, rarely will it be fully depleted.. Charging the phone requires a bit of patience though. It takes around two hours and forty minutes to reach 100% despite the use of the included 5V/2A charger. Thatâs understandable given the high battery capacity.. Huawei Y7 Prime - Smartphone Specifications 5.5 Inch HD (720 x 1280 Pixels) IPS LCD Display Android 7.0 Nougat OS Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 Chipset 3GB of RAM 12.0 MP Rear Camera. with LED Flash 8.0 MP Front Camera Dual SIM 32GB Internal Storage Expandable Up to 256 via microSD. 4G LTE, 3G HSPA+, 2G EDGE & GPRS Networks Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n Bluetooth 4.1 MicroUSB 2.0 3.5mm Audio Jack Fingerprint Sensor 4000mAh Battery â± 9,990.00 Official Price in the Philippines.

Our Huawei Y7 Prime review comes hot on the heals of our Huawei Y7 review. As suggested in its name, the Huawei Y7 Prime brings a more premium experience with better performance and the same maximum endurance offered by the high density battery.. The Huawei Y7 Prime is durable and light with a metallic body that has been given a sandblasted surface. The premium look and feel extends to the front with 2.5D glass giving an almost floating-like appearance.. Fill in the form and be the first to know when the Huawei Y7 Prime is released .. This Huawei phone is offered in Silver, Grey, Prestige Gold, Aurora Blue or Black and is 8.35mm thick. This may not be the slimmest phone around but it is far from the thickest.. Design touches that we love includes the phone status indicator and the embossed camera module edge, found on the back of the phone.. The Huawei Y7 Prime has the same 5.5â display with HD resolution, just like that on the Huawei Y7. It is the same Octa-core 1.4GHz processor (Corex-A53) too, but this time it is paired up with 3GB RAM, instead of 2GB, giving it an across the board performance edge with minimal lag times.. Unlike the standard model, the Huawei Y7 Prime has a new fingerprint sensor that lets you unlock the phone quickly. It can be used to access the Safe, where you can store your personal content, or to secure apps with an App Lock.. New: Hauwei Mate 10 Pro review. The software security is also particularly pleasing to see. Pre-loaded Avast software identifies malicious URLs in messages to protect your financial information and personal data. In the Phone Manager there is also a virus scanner, so top marks are awarded here to Huawei.. Getting started is pretty easy and with a bigger internal memory, of 32GB, you can bring more of your content over from an old smartphone or Apple iPhone. There is a microSD card slot, so should the need arise, you can add another 128GB, by purchasing a memory card. Few might want to use it, but we will mention here that there is a Simple Home Screen option for those who want a basic experience that is easy to understand.. The Huawei Y7 Prime combines Huaweiâs own EMUI 5.1 user interface with the Android 7.0 Nougat operating system. This is great because the interface is nice and clean with its Aegean inspired white and blue theme, while putting 90% of features within three clicks.. Features of note includes Eye Comfort Mode, where blue light is filtered out in the evenings in order to reduce eye strain. Magazine Unlock can be used to give a different lock screen image each time it is seen.. App Twins lets you run two instances of Facebook and WhatsApp, which is great if you have two accounts, such as a personal and work account. You can use apps in Split Screen Mode, simultaneously putting them side-by-side or switch to One-hand Mode, which shrinks the screen and moves it to one side.. The Smart Calendar on the Huawei Y7 Prime collects resources from Notes, messages and emails in order to create schedules visible in one place. Global Search lets you find reminders, emails, videos, music, online articles and apps, from the taskbar.. The Huawei Y7 Prime has a 12MP camera that has a large 1.25Î¼m pixel sensor, with a larger light sensing area, for better results in low light. Phase Detect Auto Focus focuses in just 0.3 seconds.. There are a number of camera related features that are worthwhile exploring. The first of these is the Highlights App that automatically generates videos, using your photos and videos saved in the Gallery. The app adds music and sound effects, with the option to edit these or add captions.. When you need to capture a moment without delay, the Ultra Snapshot feature lets you press the volume down button twice, to take a photo even when the screen is off. Shooting modes includes burst shooting, slow motion video and time-lapse video.. The pro camera options let you play around with the individual camera settings and here you will find a handy spirit level, for lining up your next shot. Post shot editing also brings a nice tool with Accentuate Colours, where you can select an area to remain in colour while everything else turns to black and white..

On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this..

The online store {{storeNameHasLeastPrice}} offers the best price for this Huawei Mobile when compared among 6 sellers.. PriceOye DOES NOT sells mobile phones! We only help you save money.. Full Specifications of Huawei Y7 Prime. 6.05 x 3.01 x 0.33 in. IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen, 16M colors. microSD, up to 256 GB (uses SIM 2 slot). Huawei needs to change its design. Surprisingly, an excellent set of cameras there Y7 Prime!. Plenty of juice atop the smartphone. Good return of investment considering its outlay and the specs it offers. The two sets of cameras are undoubtedly the Y7 Primeâs most prized assets. Adequate amount of processing power to run the built-in Android Nougat. 32GB of internal storage is sensational news. A 4000 mAh battery is just about as big as it gets. The displayâs size is good but the resolution couldâve been better. Weâre all well aware that Huaweiâs strength lies within giving more in less. The Y7 Prime is another example of that strength with some superb specifications within an affordable expected launch price of 25,000 rupees. Time for the details now lads!. Having excellent specifications in affordable prices is one thing but we firmly believe that Huawei needs to change the way itâs designing most of its smartphones. Bar its most premium devices that include the Honor 8 , P10 Plus etc. thereâs very little to choose between the way Huawei designs its devices. The Y7 Prime brings nothing new to the table as far as its designing is concerned with a metal design that takes inspiration from its brethren, such as the Y5 2017. Dimensions wise, weâre talking about an 8.4mm width with a 165g weight thatâs no surprise when it comes to budget smartphones.. The Y7 Prime is home to a large 5.5 inches IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 267ppi pixel density. This equates to a 720p resolution that does well on devices below 5.2 inches in size. But when it comes to large displays like the Y7 Primeâs, weâre not a 100% sure as to how will it stack-up. That being said, weâre optimistic but do expect it to fall just a tad below the mark.. While going through its specs sheet, we were particularly happy to see the smartphone featuring two rather competent cameras; the primary camera features an excellent 12 megapixel sensor with phase detection autofocus and an LED flash. Granted its customary camera features such as geo-tagging, face detection, touch-focus, HDR and panorama, the aforementioned phase detection autofocus is whatâs the difference maker here thatâll definitely play its part in producing some excellent results.. The selfie camera features another commendable 8 megapixel sensor that somewhat breaks Huaweiâs obsession with 5 megapixel sensors. So, the cameras department seems all good.. The Y7 Prime is powered by an octa-core processor with 3 gigs of RAM. Thatâs more than enough to smoothly run the built-in Android Nougat so if you were looking for a silky user experience, the Y7 Prime may just be the affordable device youâd want. Its internal storage standing at 32 gigs is music to the ears as this is an amount the masses just crave to have because of the increasing photo/video and application sizes.. A rear-mounted fingerprint scanner takes its rightful place atop the device while youâll be absolutely bamboozled to hear that the Y7 Prime is juiced by a 4000 mAh battery that almost guarantees a full dayâs worth of battery life despite heavy usage. Last but not the least, three colour schemes namely silver, pink and gold ends the Y7âs CV on a positive note.. More Mobiles like Huawei Y7 Prime.
