If you want a slim, diminutive phone that won’t make your wallet weep, but has a good camera, the Sony Xperia XA1 is one of your best options. You can get sharper screens at the price, but the photo hardware is hard to beat.. Very impressive camera for the price. Sony Xperia XA1 price and release date Out now in the US, UK and Australia Launched at $299, £229, AU$399, slightly cheaper now Design and display Smart, pocket-friendly design Plastic back, metal sides Relatively low resolution, but display is otherwise strong. You don’t need to spend a fortune on a phone. We’ve said it a hundred times before, but top-end mobiles like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone X still seem to be most people’s dream phones.. Fair enough, we can understand why.. The Sony Xperia XA1 is an altogether more practical proposition. It’s the kind of phone many can afford to buy outright, or without a contract that costs as much as a good gym membership.. Sony has aced this phone’s design in a few respects. It looks and feels slick, with metal used in the right places. This is also one of the cheapest phones you’ll find with a camera that wouldn’t have looked out of place on a flagship a year or two ago.. Screen resolution is just 720p, not 1080p, and there’s no fingerprint scanner, which is all but standard in mid-range phones. However, if you can stomach these compromises the Sony Xperia XA1 is a great, sensibly priced handset.. The Xperia XA1 first went on sale in April 2017. It’s part of the same generation as the Xperia XZ and Xperia XZ Premium , and it has a brother too, called the Xperia XA1 Ultra .. The XA1 launched at $299 / £229 / AU$399 while its big brother, which has a far larger 6-inch screen, costs £329 (around $420, AU$570). The XA1 has dropped in price with us seeing it as low as £200/$280 and 2GB deals starting in the UK at £15 a month.. The Sony Xperia XA1 looks like a smaller, narrower version of the Xperia XZ. How it is built is rather different, though.. Instead of a lot of glass and metal, this is a mostly plastic phone with some curved metal panels on the sides to give your hands the cool, hard feel plastic lacks. It actually took us a while to realize the back isn’t metal, because the Xperia XA1 feels like such a dense little brick of phone. Sony has done a good job of making this affordable design seem classy.. It has a more expensive look than the Moto G5 , for example, which reverses the Sony Xperia XA1’s style with a metal panel on the back and plastic elsewhere. This phone is also reasonably slim at 8mm thick, and has some of the thinnest screen surrounds of any Xperia phone, regardless of price.. The Sony Xperia XA1 does have pretty big blank expanses of black above and below the display, but this just makes it seem long and slender, not harder to handle. Long and slim is often better than short and stubby.. It also has most of the Sony design hallmarks seen in other Xperia phones. The power button is the little metal dot Xperias had before it doubled as a finger scanner, and there’s a physical camera button on the right side. You don’t see those too often anymore.. The obvious missing feature here is a fingerprint scanner. This is an issue given the cheaper Moto G5 now has a scanner, but you’ll just have to decide whether it’s a deal-breaker for you or not. The Sony Xperia XA1 also lacks the water resistance common among more expensive Xperias.. The consolation prize is 32GB of storage, which is enough for most people. There’s also a microSD card slot in the pull-out tray in which the nanoSIM lives.. This phone is a good choice is you want minimalist style without paying too much, and some of you may even prefer its feel to that of the much bigger Sony Xperia XZ Premium. That phone is a bit of a handful.. While the slim screen surround helps, the key to the Sony Xperia XA1’s great pocketability is simple: it has a fairly small screen. It’s 5 inches across and of 720p resolution.. This is where the phone starts to lose its grip on any claims of great value. The cheaper Moto G5 has a 1080p display, and to keen eyes the difference will be fairly obvious.. Text looks less clean and sharp close-up, and you’ll see more ‘jaggies’ in 3D games. However, it’s easy to overstate the importance of this for those who aren’t true mobile phone nerds. The Sony Xperia XA1’s screen is still fairly sharp, and its other characteristics are actually pretty good.. Color is respectably rich and vivid. It loses out to the XZ Premium, which can deliver incredible saturation for an LCD phone, but the Xperia XA1 actually strikes a good balance between punch and a natural look.. The display is also super-bright, if you need it to be, and contrast is very good. Max out the backlight and outdoors visibility is excellent.. It’s still one of the most expensive phones still using a 720p screen, though, so don’t buy if you’re going to notice, and be bothered by, the slight pixelation.. Digging a little deeper, the Sony Xperia XA1 also has special image enhancement modes designed to make your photos and videos look either more powerful or super-saturated. We’d advise not using these to view your own photos, as they’ll look totally different when you transfer them to a different device or upload them to Facebook. It’s a bit like applying an Instagram filter only you can see.. Sony’s standard - and rather unfriendly - white balance controls also reappear in the Sony Xperia XA1, although we found the phone’s default look pleasant. Some Sony phones have a blue skew to their screens, but XA1 is actually slightly warm-leaning.. Next Page What's it like to use?.

Sony’s 2017 mid-range device is a camera focussed phone, something you don’t often get at this price. For that reason alone, the Xperia XA1 is worth considering.. Yet, there are plenty of areas where the compromises are very obvious.. In a competitive market, where the likes of the Motorola Moto G5 (£180) and Lenovo P2 (£200 on the Three network) remain the most attractive choices, the XA1 faces tough competition.. As is often the case with smartphones, the best upfront price will find you locked to a specific mobile network. In this case it’s O2, where you’ll be able to pick up an XA1 for £220, with a minimum £10 top-up for a total of £230. If you want it unlocked, you can head to Carphone Warehouse, where the device will set you back £250.. The XA1 has a 5-inch screen, which has become a rarity these days; I suspect it’s easier to make a big-battery phone with a large screen – as it the case with the 5.5-inch Lenovo P2.. Sony deals with this challenge by making the top and bottom portion of the bezel more generous (by phone standards), while keeping the left and right portions super-slim. This gives the XA1 a rather elongated look, which I honestly didn’t mind. The design doesn’t affect my ability to use the phone, since the screen is a standard size, nor does it cause any issues when slipping the device into my pocket.. The design won’t be for everyone, and I wish I had one of the more attractive, coloured models instead of the plain white version. The rear of the handset is made of plastic; the sides are metal. There are gaps visible all over the phone – and it didn’t take long for the XA1 to become damaged, with white paint chipping off above the SIM slot. Not a great start, but it did survive a fall underneath a seat on the tube, which was impressive considering the amount of grit to be found on train floors.. All the buttons are on the right edge of the device, with a volume rocker, classic Xperia circular power button and a dedicated camera button. The latter allows you to take a light and focus reading, after which you can take the picture.. On the left is the SIM slot, which has space for a microSD card up to 256GB; this is alongside the generous 32GB of internal memory. A 3.5mm headset jack can be found at the top.. At the rear, the camera sits tucked into the back cover, with a protective metal ring around it to further distance it from scratchy tables and floors.. You’ll notice I haven’t mentioned a fingerprint scanner; that’s because there isn’t one. This is quite unusual these days, especially for a phone costing this amount. I’ve seen scanners on phones as cheap as £100, so for Sony not to include one is disappointing.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

Screen snobs will have stopped reading by this point, but for the rest of us this display is totally fine. Yes, text isn’t as sharp as it could be and hi-res images might not look great, but your Facebook and Instagram feeds will look just fine. The display can’t compete to the Moto G5’s 5-inch, 1920 x 1080 resolution screen, however.. I could read it in direct sunlight at maximum brightness, although at night I found even minimum brightness a little too bright for my sensitive, sleepy eyes.. Whites have a slightly blue tinge to them and viewing angles are fairly narrow; but, again, colour images are well represented and there are no standout problems.. On the audio front, the downward-facing speakers are nothing more than mediocre. The microphone is a different story, however: it does a fantastic job of cutting out background noise and picking up the voices you want to hear.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

Offer Type: Base | Color: White | Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. I have been a Windows Phone user since 2012. I was lured by a few things - the design of the phones themselves, the customizability of the interface, the relatively low price of the handsets, and the superiority of Nokia imaging technology. My favorite of my Windows Phones was the Lumia 1020, possessor of the famed 41-megapixel camera. My most recent phone has been the Lumia 950, which has a 20-mp shooter. But things have been looking down for Microsoft's mobile ambitions of late, and I've been looking for an Android phone that would give me something close. The Sony XA1 wound up being my choice, based on design, value for the dollar, the claimed camera prowess, and dedicated shutter button. So how has the XA1 lived up to my expectations? In short, quite well, allowing for a few imperfections. DESIGN and HARDWARE My oh my, this is a pretty phone. The front is covered by a single sheet of Gorilla Glass. The screen is nearly bezel-less on the sides - not quite the effect of the new Samsung handsets, but quite close. The top and bottom do have quite tall bezels, but the effect is to make the phone tall and svelte-feeling. The back is a poly-carbonate with a metallic texture. The top and bottom edges, as well as the camera, feature a very understated chrome accent. The IPS-LCD, 5" diagonal screen is 720p. This is a sacrifice to keep the price down, but to my mind it ends up not being much of one. The contrast level is reasonable punchy, with dark blacks and bright whites. At normal reading distances, I cannot see any jagged edges, and I have good vision. It is easy to read in most sunny conditions. It's not a premium screen by any stretch, but it looks good. Personally, I'll take increased battery life and decreased CPU load over a higher-res screen. The mono speaker at bottom is mediocre - but the headphone jack will give you the ability to supplement a great pair of headphones (none are included). USB-C is the connection for data and charging, and it is fast, functional and clicky-firm. All in all, if you show this to friends and ask them to guess how much it cost, I think most will overshoot the XA1's price. CAMERA This is my number one priority in a smartphone. Sony has included the 23-megapixel Xmor RS sensor that formerly graced its 2015 flagship phone, the Xperia Z5. The back-side illuminated sensor is sized at 1/2.3”, and receives light through a f/2.0 aperture 24mm lens. These specs are comparable or superior to most flagships on the market in 2017, which is a big deal for such an inexpensive phone. If the sensor performs as well as it is specced, this makes the XA1 a real bargain for someone who prioritizes imaging over other features (which I do). All told, I would say that this sensor does mostly live up to the billing. In good lighting conditions, it wasn't far off in quality from my Lumia 950 (which launched for $549 18 months ago) and regularly equaled my wife's iPhone 7 ($649). Color is excellent, and detail is quite good. Low light performance is fairly good but not class-leading, though it is competitive with most of the mid-range competition. Attached you will see some sample shots I took (check the comments for an imgur link to full-sized snaps). 5x digital "Clear Zoom" is a hyped feature - predictably, it looks like garbage, as it does on any other smart phone. There is also the typical aggressive Sony edge enhancement when shooting in "Superior Auto" mode. This is attenuated somewhat in Manual mode, but not entirely. I wish Sony would ditch the edge enhancement completely, or at least allow RAW shooting. The single LED flash is OK as a last resort, but is not powerful enough to provide fill lighting when shooting subjects illuminated from the rear (as on a sunny day when the subjects are in the shade). At the end of the day, no camera, not the iPhone 7-plus, not the Samsung Galaxy S8, not even my beloved Lumia 1020, can equal the optics of a dedicated mirrorless or DSLR camera. But the XA1 is good to excellent for impromptu snaps, social media sharing, and macro photography, especially shooting in manual mode. PERFORMANCE The Helios P20 CPU provides smooth, stutter-free performance. I suffered no lags on regular tasks like Facebook, Messenger, web browsing, or light game playing (e.g. App switching and dismissal was buttery smooth. I was very pleasantly surprised, coming from a series of phones that use the Qualcomm Snapdragon series of CPUs. The 3gb of RAM probably helps, too, especially in crunching the numbers on the large camera sensor. Basically, I'd say this CPU/RAM solution equals or beats any 600-series Snapdragon. Battery life was quite good, probably owing to the lower-res screen and less power-hungry CPU. I just completed a long 14 hour day of heavy use with web browsing, photography, emailing, and text messaging - the battery is just under 50%. A day and a half should be easily reachable with medium use. The phone uses very little juice in standby - probably only 1-2% per hour. SOFTWARE Sony has shipped this phone with a lightly skinned version of Android 7.0 Nougat. While the Sony skin is inoffensive and is quite close to "stock," I ended up going with the Square Home 2 launcher (pictured) to give me a more Windows 10-style feel. The phone handles this launcher like a champ, and I have noticed no increased battery drain. Manufacturer-installed software included a few Sony programs for Music, Photos, TV Schedules and the like, and all can be easily bypassed for other defaults if you don't like them. CONCLUSION The value for the money is pretty high here. You're getting above average for the price range camera performance and 3gb of RAM with otherwise mid-range internals. Android performance is snappier than many mid-range competitors. The build quality looks more expensive than it is. What are you giving up? There is no fingerprint scanner, you're not getting the "brand name" Snapdragon CPU, and the screen is less than 1080p. Since these are not high priorities for me, I find the value proposition here to be quite a good one. So the XA1 has some very nice aspects, a few sacrifices and no glaring issues. As such, I think 4 stars is a good rating. I don't think anyone who ponies up the asking price will feel cheated.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Don't buy this phone. There is an issue with .... Offer Type: Base | Color: Black | Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. There is an issue with the touch on the sides of the screen not working. I have to turn this phone sideways to type anything that exists on the right side of the screen.

It keeps freezing, and the swift keyboard makes writing annoying. I haven't figured out how to get rid of the option for the swift keyboard as it keeps appearing when I am sending a text, so if I'm not paying attention...tsk, it's there. I also detest how sensitive it is to tilt, only to take a bit of time to tilt BACK. Even though I did what I cold to adjust the settings, portrait to landscape is immediate, Landscape to Portrait? No. I've resorted to shaking the phone in frustration. It's very possible I am missing a lot of options in the settings, so of course, I will own that some of it is my fault..

Offer Type: Base | Color: Black | Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. I wanted the phone to be great but it has issues and I can say without a doubt that I wasted my money. The swipe down from the top never works and sometimes you'll miss calls that may be important. The battery life is just horrible and the connection to PlayStation is bad. I can say the positive aspects for this phone are the size and the camera is great, minus the image stabilization which isn't very good. I even put in a few alarms to go off and I couldn't depend on that alone. I wish I could get a refund because you need 3 to 4 months to really see if the phone is good or bad and sadly the XA1 is a very bad phone..

Offer Type: Base | Color: Black | Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. I'm surprised by how well made this product is for the price. As a lot has already been said about this phone I will just highlight the positives and negatives. Pros: - Great price for what you get - Fast, responsive OS - Good style - Sound quality over calls is quite good - Exceptional batter quality Cons - The back of the phone scratches very easily - The silver stripe makes the phone feel plastic and lower quality - Video from the camera is very poor - Camera seems to be forced into "wide angle" style, while appealing, photos become very similar after a while.

Sony Xperia XA1 Review Sony Xperia XA1 manual Sony Xperia XA1 benchmarks. Dimensions: 5.71 x 2.64 x 0.31 inches (145 x 67 x 8 mm). Weight: 5.04 oz (143 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 5.0 inches. Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass, Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus (Laser, Phase detection). Software Features: Manual focus, Object tracking, Touch to focus, Smile detection, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets, Shutter speed control. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Scenes. Features: Digital image stabilization, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Octa-core, 2300 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 11.30 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 23.3 days (560 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 10.12 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 25.1 days (603 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Stand-by time (4G): 23.8 days (572 hours) the average is 23 days (549 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. by Daniel Petrov. Android - Android + Sony - Sony +. 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction Sony is breathing new life in its midrange offers for the US with the new Xperia XA1 , which comes hot on the heels of its Xperia XZs release here. In Sony's case , it simply starts selling those in its shop or on Amazon, and they only work on T-Mobile and AT&T, but it's nice to have extra options. The Xperia XA1 goes for $299.99 at Amazon, B&H, Best Buy, Fry's, and the other usual suspects, and offers an intriguing mix of entry level and midrange specs, such as a 5-inch 720p screen , but 23 MP camera and 3GB RAM. Is it worth the dough? Let's see... Design Sony's oldieblocky polycarb is now a breath of fresh air in the sea of metal or glass phones. In the year of bezel minimalism, Sony's phones look especially out of the loop, and the XA1 is no exception. The 5” screen is framed between huge top and bottom bezel areas, making the Sony as tall as the 5.2” honor 8 or Galaxy A5, not to mention bezel-busting flagships like the 5.7” G6 or the 5.8” S8 , which are only slightly larger than the XA1. The phone still comes with on-screen keys, though, and this one doesn't have front-firing stereo speakers, as the lower slit is simply a mic, while the sole speaker is situated at the bottom. Despite this, the phone has a pleasantly distinct and elegant look to it. The Xperia XA1 is narrow enough to be comfortable for one-handed operation, and feels sturdy in the palm. In fact, it is solid as a brick, despite the all-plastic construction, and we appreciate the inclusion of a modern USB-C port at the bottom. When it comes to buttons, the plastic volume rocker on the right is a bit smallish and wobbly under the thumb, with somewhat shallow feedback, while the signature metal home key of Sony is well-placed to comfortably feel and press without looking. There is a dedicated camera key, as usual, something we've learned to appreciate in Sony's Android designs. Display While unremarkable in resolution, the HD display does the job in color balance and outdoor visibility A 5” 720x1280 resolution LCD screen is nothing to pop champagne about in the pixel density department, but an HD screen is sufficient at this diagonal, and there are battery gains to be had with this resolution. That's coming a bit further in the review, though, and for now we'll just mention that the picture doesn't lean to the colder side of the spectrum, as usual with Sony's mobile screens, but is rather spot on in terms of color temperature. It is also bright enough and with low screen reflectance to seem perfectly legible under direct sunlight, too.. 5.71 x 2.64 x 0.31 inches. 145 x 67 x 8 mm. 5.91 x 2.91 x 0.38 inches. 150.2 x 74 x 9.7 mm. 5.75 x 2.81 x 0.31 inches. 146.1 x 71.4 x 7.9 mm. 5.77 x 2.83 x 0.28 inches. 146.5 x 72 x 7.2 mm.

Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software..

There are sacrifices to be made, though.. by February 26, 2017 11:45 PM PST. Sony Xperia XA1 and XA1 Ultra go big on screen. It's bye bye bezels on Sony's new mid-range XA1 and XA.... Additional XA1 specs: 8-megapixel front-facing camera 2,300mAh battery USB-C charging Additional XA1 Ultra specs: 16-megapixel front-facing camera with LED flash 2,700mAh battery USB-C charging. If your budget doesn't stretch to Sony's latest top-end flagship, the new Xperia XZ , perhaps its new midrange Xperia XA1 and XA1 Ultra will be a bit more up your street.. The XA1 is the smaller of the two, with a 5.2-inch 720p display, while the Ultra balloons out with a 6-inch full HD screen. The bezels on both phones have been shrunk down to tiny slivers, allowing the screens to stretch across the whole front. The edge-to-edge displays look particularly great with full-screen photos or videos playing.. Aside from the size, the main specs of the two phones are pretty much the same. Both have 23-megapixel cameras on the back, both have 32GB of storage that can be expanded with microSD cards and both run MediaTek processors.. MWC 2017: All the gadgets announced so far. Both the XA1 and XA1 Ultra will come in black, white, gold and rose gold colours and will be available later this year, although Sony hasn't given specific timing or price details..

Florian Wimmer ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 07/01/2017. Android ARM Smartphone Touchscreen. Xperia XA1 is the name of Sony's mid-range smartphone this year. With high-resolution cameras and an extravagant design, it definitely has what it takes to be a crowd-pleaser. But can the SoC deliver enough power? And what about battery life? We will answer these and other questions in the test..

Sony takes a risk: Instead of copying the design philosophy from Samsung and Apple like many other manufacturers, the Japanese smartphone-builder prefers to create its own style. The virtually edgeless design of last year's Sony Xperia XA pleased us, and it is even a bit more autonomous this year. Sony's Xperia XA1 that we are now testing has a very long but also very slim shape. This looks elegant, but Sony naturally wants to convince with other features: Quick Charge, LTE Cat.7, and a low weight are to also contribute to its success. High-resolution cameras on the front and rear are almost a must - after all, Sony is one of the major developers of mobile camera modules.. The Xperia XA1 is situated in the mid-range at around 270 Euros (~$306). Here, we find many competitors, for example, Lenovo's Moto G5 Plus or Huawei's P10 Lite. Honor's 6X is also an interesting mid-range device that wants to convince with a good price-performance ratio. Let's find out whether our review sample can keep up with them..

The more angular design of Sony's Xperia XA1 is very daring and contrasts the continuously decreasing edge of Apple's iPhone and Samsung's gently curved Galaxy smartphones. We welcome that someone suggests a different design language, especially since the Xperia XA1 presents nice and also very unusual proportions. The 16:9 screen and the extremely narrow lateral edges around the display let the smartphone look very slim but also relatively tall. The lightly backward-curved glass on the corners even adds to the already very stylish impression. The height of 8 millimeters is average; bulkier and also slimmer smartphones exist in the mid-range.. The corners are more eye-catching than in other smartphones, but they are still lightly curved. Thus, Sony's Xperia XA1 is pleasant to hold. The narrow shape is an advantage for small hands. Pressure on the back is not passed on to the screen. Strong pressure on the front causes minor wave formations in the liquid crystals that are, however, only visible when looking closer. The smartphone can be warped slightly and also produces quiet cracking noises then. This is the only point that slightly reduces the high-quality overall impression.. Users who find black boring can select another available color: white, gold or pink.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. As for memory configuration, Sony installs more GB in terms of RAM and storage device into its smartphone than in the predecessor. Sony's Xperia XA1 has 32 GB of storage and 3 GB of working memory. This is also desperately needed seeing that it has become standard in the mid-range. Huawei's P10 Lite even has 4 GB of RAM. The storage can be expanded via a micro-SD card. Cards with up to 256 GB are supported. The micro-SD can be formatted as internal storage and apps can be moved to the card.. A dual-SIM variant of Sony's Xperia XA1 exists. However, it is not officially offered in Central Europe. Thus, the LTE 20 band (800 MHz) that is important in Germany is not supported. This is still tolerable in cities but an LTE network will perhaps not be found in rural areas, depending on the network provider. It is too bad that Sony does not offer its dual-SIM smartphones globally. Many manufacturers, such as OnePlus, have won over many fans with this.. The smartphone has a USB-C port that, however, only operates at USB 2.0 speeds. At least it supports USB OTG. NFC for wireless near field communication is also installed in the Xperia XA1.. Right: volume control, standby button, camera button. Sony obediently follows Google's design specifications for Android and implements the flat material design quite consistently. The many graphics in Sony's modified Android 7 are also designed correspondingly and pep up the often slightly text-heavy operating system. The home screen with a relatively small clock widget might look a bit cramped in delivery state. However, it becomes more straightforward after cleaning up. The security patches are dated April 7, 2017, which is not quite up-to-date at test time. Sony is known for software tweaks to improve many functions in the operating system. There is an option for image optimization and audio can be adapted extensively. The smartphone observes the user's habits and provides corresponding tips for better utilization. This functions even better when it is registered for Xperia services.. Sony also preloads some proprietary apps, such as a music player, a gallery app and video software. The PlayStation app and its own app store dubbed "What's New" are just as available as the Xperia Lounge. The user can enjoy exclusive prize games and advantages when the Xperia XA1 is registered here. The media apps plus corresponding Google apps that are, of course, also preloaded are annoying. Sony's own virus scanner and some other apps also halve the storage. Fans of a clean Android will have to uninstall a lot of apps.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

LTE Cat.7 along with seven supported bands, and four GSM and four UMTS frequencies is a good configuration in the mid-range. Lenovo's Moto G5 Plus is even a more global-phone: It supports considerably more LTE frequencies. It is probably better to stay within Europe with the Xperia XA1 for ensuring reception. There should be no issues here. The reception in the well-developed German Vodafone network in cities was also good indoors. We usually achieved 3/4 of the signal strength here.. Fast 802.11 ac Wi-Fi is not supported, but only Huawei's P10 Lite is capable of this standard among the comparison devices. Otherwise, the Xperia XA1 supports all up-to-date Wi-Fi standards and also communicates in the less frequented 5 GHz range. We achieved decent transmission rates in our standardized Wi-Fi test with the Linksys EA8500. Websites opened quickly near the router and the full signal was displayed. Pages opened much slower at a distance of 10 meters and through three walls. Only half the signal was received here..

The Xperia XA1 easily found us indoors, and its accuracy of up to six meters is not bad at all. The signal was much stronger outdoors and we were located with an accuracy of up to two meters. But is the GPS module in the Xperia XA1 also convincing in practice? We put the smartphone in a backpack alongside Garmin's Edge 500 professional navigation system and went for a bike ride. The logged route is compared with Runtastic. A difference of just 100 meters on a measured route of almost 12 kilometers is not bad. The Xperia XA1 does not trace the route as precisely as the professional navigation system, but the accuracy is nevertheless impressive for a smartphone and definitely sufficient for free-time use..

Sony does not modify the phone app and uses Google's stock app. This is absolutely okay since the Android phone app has many features and arranges them neatly in tabs. However, the keypad can only be opened by tapping the always visible dial icon.. The calling sound quality is one of Sony's expert fields, and the Xperia XA1 is largely convincing here. The contact is clearly intelligible, but the earpiece distorts slightly at maximum volume. The sound seemed even a bit clearer with the "Clear Audio Plus" audio improvement that can be enabled in the settings. The microphone does a decent job, but its sound is not quite clean: Loud voices cause audible, minor distortions and a slight hum. The call quality is absolutely satisfactory for everyday use, but it is not awesome.. The cameras are also a field where Sony is virtually forced to deliver good results. After all, it is the biggest mobile camera manufacturer in the world. Sony is not stingy and installs a 23-megapixel camera on the rear and an 8-megapixel camera on the front of the Xperia XA1. The primary camera has a hybrid autofocus that combines the phase comparison and contrast method to focus even faster. The primary camera also features a 24-mm wide angle lens and an LED flash. The ISO sensitivity can be increased up to 6400, which is to allow taking good photos even in dark scenarios. It is good that Sony installs a physical camera button.. But what do the photos made with the camera that has a very high resolution for the mid-range look like? In fact, the wide angle lens has an impact: Compared with the standard lens in LG's G6 (this device also has a wide angle lens), a much bigger image section is captured. We find the dynamics in low light a bit too low; hardly any details are visible here. We noticed some strange distortions that almost look like blurred movement in the very left photo area. At first glance, the camera's reproduction can throughout compete with a high-end device like LG's G6. However, the photos of LG's G6 look a bit sharper and more accurately exposed in our zoomed details. The color reproduction of Sony's Xperia XA1 looks quite neutral. The camera in Sony's Xperia XA1 has its moment of fame in low-light situations: It brightens the scenario very well - even more than the camera in LG's G6. Although the photos exhibit a heavy color noise, it can hardly be prevented in such low light and is also visible in photos made with the reflex camera.. The primary camera only records videos in 1080p. However, a 4K video encoder is installed in the SoC. Sony likely reserves this feature for its premium-range devices. The videos still look relatively sharp, and the exposure adapts quite fast and suitably for the scenario. However, it also lacks a bit of dynamics in dark surroundings.. The front camera takes photos in a resolution of 8 megapixels, and it also features a wide angle lens. The color reproduction is quite cool, but the photos look relatively sharp otherwise. The dynamics is again a bit too low in dark surroundings. The front camera also records videos in 1080p, and movement is smooth and the exposure is adapted well. The too low dynamics issue in dark environments continues here, as well.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. We additionally test the primary camera under defined light conditions in the lab. Here, the primary camera's very high sharpness becomes especially visible. This high sharpness is even maintained when zooming the details. Strangely, the lateral blurriness is not seen here. However, the "lack of dynamics issue" is again obvious with black text on a brown background. Otherwise, the primary camera delivers an excellent outcome in terms of sharpness. Unfortunately, the color reproduction is a bit distorted; colored areas also look patchy.. Original colors are displayed in the lower half of each patch.. A charger and USB C cable are included. It is too bad that this combination does not allow quick-charging although the device supports the Pump Express technology. A dedicated quick charger for which Sony demands a high 50 Euros (~$56) is available. A cover with a kickstand is also offered for almost 40 Euros (~$45). A headset is in the box.. Sony offers a 24-month warranty for its Xperia XA1 in Central Europe.. Sony preloads the Swift Key keyboard. The keyboard is clearly arranged and offers diverse input and setting options. However, the keys' double assignment can sometimes make things a bit confusing. Users who prefer Google's GBoard or another keyboard will have to install it from Google's Play Store.. The touchscreen is still very sensitive in the corners and is really pleasant to use. The touchscreen's sleek surface allows the finger to glide well. Diverse input aids for users with disabilities can be enabled but special gesture or movement controls are absent. In return, Xperia Actions that, for example, mute the phone at a specified time and place can be defined. Thus, the user can define a do not disturb time for the night.. With a resolution of 1280x720 pixels, the Xperia XA1 lags behind its rivals that already have Full HD screens. The reproduction on the 5-inch screen nevertheless looks quite sharp; single pixels are not visible. The XA1 is on category level with an average brightness of 499 cd/mÂ², but there are two corners that are not illuminated well. The smartphone has a minimum brightness of 37.83 cd/mÂ², which is a relatively high rate and also has an impact on the black value as we will see in a moment. The illumination of 92% is still good and we did not see brightness differences with the naked eye.. 478 cd/m² 504 cd/m² 491 cd/m² 504 cd/m² 522 cd/m² 503 cd/m² 499 cd/m² 503 cd/m² 483 cd/m². 92 % Center on Battery: 522. cd/m²) ΔE Color 4.2 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 6.4 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.18.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 8995 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. The black level of 0.74 cd/mÂ² is not exactly awesome. Dark areas sometimes look more like dark gray rather than black. The contrast of 705:1 is on an acceptable level, but the rivals are still much better.. Content looks relatively sharp and can be adapted via image optimization and manual white balance. The colors have an average deviation from the sRGB color space reference value. We determine this in our tests with a spectrophotometer and CalMAN software. Furthermore, a distinct violet tint is visible, especially in the bright grayscale. Although the color-space coverage is only an approximation due to the inaccurate measurement in CalMAN, 93% makes it evident that the sRGB color-space coverage is presumably quite high. The color reproduction looks quite accurate to the naked eye..

In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.9 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is similar to the average of all tested devices (42.2 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Sony's Xperia XA1 can be used well outdoors thanks to the maximum brightness. Shade is only needed in direct sunlight or on very bright days.. We barely noticed brightness or color deviations with the naked eye when we tilted the smartphone's screen. However, the screenshots show that there are both color and brightness differences. The image can, however, still be recognized well even from very flat angles.. Although the MediaTek Helio P20 MT6757 is not a brand-new SoC anymore, it has been on the market for one-and-a-half years now, Sony's Xperia XA1 is the first smartphone with which we can test the SoC. The processor part has eight cores that clock at up to 2.3 GHz. The Xperia XA1 accomplishes performance rates that are on the category level. However, Lenovo's Moto G5 Plus, for example, is faster. This difference will unlikely be noticed in everyday use. It was possible to use the smartphone smoothly and we did not have any performance problems with the apps that we tested.. An ARM Mali-T880 MP2 graphics card is installed. It consists of two cores that can clock at up to 900 MHz. The Xperia XA1 is on par with the fast Lenovo Moto G5 Plus here and is also much faster than the other comparison devices. Compared with its predecessor, the performance plus is also significant. The screen's low resolution in conjunction with the powerful graphics unit is a well-chosen combination here..

Sony's Xperia XA1 quickly reads and writes on SD cards, as our test with the Toshiba Exceria Pro M401 reference card proves. The card would theoretically allow even higher write and read speeds, but the rates of the Xperia XA1 are very fast under real-world conditions seen absolutely.. Accessing the internal storage is also very fast in general. The rate only drops clearly during random write access. The Xperia XA1 delivers good speeds otherwise..

The Xperia XA1 is quite suitable for playing games. The screen is, of course, a bit smaller than in many comparison devices, but the displayed graphics are calculated very quickly. The frame rates did not drop below 30 frames per second in any of the games that we tested. Thus, the games always ran smoothly. More basic games like Angry Birds can also be played without problems.. Controls via position sensor and touchscreen functioned just as smoothly.. We measured a maximum of 44 Â°C in the camera's area on the rear, which is also the maximum temperature after prolonged load. Up to 40.5 Â°C was reached on the front. This can sometimes get unpleasant in the summer, for example when holding the smartphone to the ear when making calls or when it is in a pocket. The maximum temperature drops to 36.7 Â°C in idle mode, which is also still very palpable.. At least the SoC's full performance can still be retrieved when the smartphone has been put under full load for a prolonged period. We determine this by running the GFXBench battery test that calculates the same sequence 30 times in succession and logs the speed.. 40.2 °C 40.5 °C 36.7 °C. 40.3 °C 39.7 °C 38.6 °C. 40 °C 40.2 °C 38.6 °C.

The little speaker on the lower edge is primarily made for playing back voices and songs. In return, mids are relatively balanced and do not distort. The subjective impression corresponds to the test results from the ARTA software suite that can be read below. It is also correct that the speaker remains relatively quiet. Thus, vocals are very prominent in music. Listening to classical music is also possible, although violins are almost unpleasantly dominant while the dark strings are barely audible at maximum volume. Classical music sounds much better at medium volume. Music fans will nevertheless prefer using headphones. The included headset is quite suitable for this. It produces a warm sound and details are also well-perceptible. The sound output with other headphones and via Bluetooth to speakers is clear and static-free.. Sony also offers some audio improvements, such as an installed equalizer or the ClearAudio+ audio improvement. We often heard a clear difference in other smartphones with bigger speakers in the past. However, this is kept within limits in Sony's Xperia XA1.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 31.6 34.9 25 25.4 30.7 31 25.3 26.9 40 32.9 31.8 50 33.6 28.6 63 31.6 31.8 80 28.4 31.8 100 27 31 125 20.8 30.4 160 22 26.6 200 21.3 27.6 250 20.8 31.4 315 21.2 39.2 400 19.4 48.4 500 19.5 54.2 630 17.7 59.5 800 17.9 63.3 1000 17.8 64.8 1250 17.3 65 1600 17.4 65.1 2000 16.7 64.4 2500 17.2 67.7 3150 18.2 68 4000 17.9 65.9 5000 17.6 69 6300 17.7 66.5 8000 17.8 60.6 10000 17.9 61 12500 18.1 53 16000 18.2 37.1 SPL 30 76.7 N 1.3 38 median 17.9 Sony Xperia XA1 median 60.6 Delta 1.3 12.9 28 32.4 28 33.3 31.3 33.3 32.5 31.7 32.5 34.9 26 34.9 47.6 39.4 47.6 33.7 36.2 33.7 30.7 28.6 30.7 27.9 25.4 27.9 30.4 21.3 30.4 33.2 23.3 33.2 35.1 22.5 35.1 41.8 22.4 41.8 45.4 21.3 45.4 50 18.4 50 55.8 17.5 55.8 60.5 17.5 60.5 67 17.2 67 67.4 16.8 67.4 68.1 17.3 68.1 64.8 17.4 64.8 58.7 16.6 58.7 64 17.3 64 71.5 17.6 71.5 74 17.6 74 74.5 17.7 74.5 73.9 17.4 73.9 71 17.7 71 69.4 17.9 69.4 58.3 18.1 58.3 48.9 18.1 48.9 82 29.8 82 48.5 1.3 48.5 median 60.5 Sony Xperia XA median 17.7 median 60.5 11.6 1.6 11.6 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Frequency diagram comparison (checkboxes above can be turned on/off!). Sony's Xperia XA1 is very clearly an energy-efficient smartphone. It consumes less power than the comparison devices in all performance scenarios. The difference to the predecessor is a whole 66%, and it is even higher to the other comparison devices. The device consumes a maximum of 3.31 watts, which is a very good rate in view of the performance..

Even if the battery with 2300 mAh or 8.7 Wh does not have a higher capacity than the predecessor, the Xperia XA1 manages a considerably longer runtime than its predecessor thanks to the low consumption. However, some mid-range smartphones, such as Honor's 6X, offer an even longer battery life thanks to a much stronger battery. Nevertheless, 11:55 hours of Wi-Fi browsing is not a bad outcome for the Xperia XA1. The Xperia XA only managed roughly half this time. The smartphone also lasted for two normal workdays, and it could even be three when it is not used often.. It is too bad that the included power supply does not support quick-charge technology. Thus, a full recharge takes approximately 2 hours, but this is still a good rate.. Idle (without WLAN, min brightness) 23h. NBC WiFi Websurfing Battery Test 1.3 11h.

Sony's Xperia XA1 is a successful evolution of the former Xperia XA. The smartphone has been improved in many aspects, such as battery life, power consumption, performance, and camera. Old Sony virtues like the physical camera button, diverse settings for audio and video, and the intricately self-developed software are, naturally, still present.. Compared with other smartphones of this category, Sony's Xperia XA1 has some shortcomings: Sony still installs a 720p screen while Full HD is actually standard now. Only the slightly smaller screen size makes this acceptable. Also, Sony's XA1 can get quite warm, which can be unpleasant especially in the summer when the smartphone is carried around in a pocket. The speaker is mediocre, just like the call quality. Sony has done a better job with these in the past. However, the Xperia XA1 can keep up well in these two aspects within the price range. It is too bad that Sony does not include a quick charger. Furthermore, the lack of a fingerprint scanner is inappropriate for this class.. Sony has reworked its Xperia XA1 mid-range smartphone and manages to outrun the competition in terms of camera, power consumption and gaming performance. The design is unique and is very successful and elegant. Only the low-resolution screen might deter some buyers.. Sony's Xperia XA1 can be recommended despite some minor points of criticism: The camera is clearly situated above the price range and can even compete with high-end devices like LG's G6 , and the battery life is very good despite the very small battery. Sony is at least on par with the rivals or even surpasses them evidently in many aspects. There are hardly any major weaknesses, and the Xperia XA1's unique shape and stylish, edgeless design even appeals to the heart.. Sony Xperia XA1 - 2017-06-29 06/29/2017 v6 Florian Wimmer.

Offering a best-in-class camera experience the XA1 is a smartphone that delivers in all of the key areas.. An upgrade to the 2016 Xperia XA, the XA1 benefits from a few enhancements to make it that little more current and competitive amongst the array of devices available today.. Clove Technology only sells official UK specification SIM Free and factory unlocked smartphones for use on any UK / EU network.. For 4G / LTE support outside of the EU, please check the specifications and your local carrier.. The Sony Xperia XA1 is set to be available in a variety of colour and memory options.. Internal memory is 32GB with 3GB of RAM available with each model.. The colour options are Gold, White, Black and Pink.. The XA1 bucks the trend somewhat retaining a smaller 5” screen form factor, whilst many other handsets are now boasting screens of 5.5” or larger.. There is little compromise in the handset's design, performance and feature availability, thanks to the specifications built into this handset.. Android 7.0 is the latest version of the popular mobile operating system that is installed on this handset.. From the moment you switch the device on you have access to lots of great software features from Google and Sony.. Sign into a Google account you already have or create one in just a few moments and the capabilities of the XA1 are further enhanced as your contacts, calendar appointments, applications and more become available to you.. Access the Google Play store for your favourite third party applications and services.. Within less than 10 minutes you can be up and running.. Sony also put on plenty of their own customisations that allow you to get more value from this 4G enabled handset.. With 32GB of internal storage most apps and media can be loaded right onto the internal memory, but if you need it the microSD card slot. provides the possibility for up to another 256GB of storage space.. The MediaTek Helio P20 octa-core processor and 3GB of RAM combine to keep things ticking along nicely.. 4G and Wi-Fi are of course present, so you can be connected to the internet and go about your daily life. Be that for checking the weather, the news, the football scores, sharing snaps from your night out, organising your social life or managing emails and documents for work.. You need not be tied to a wall with the XA1 as the 2300mAh battery will get most through a working day. However should you need it, the phone supports Qnovo adaptive charging and MediaTek’s PumpExpress 2.0 which means with the right power adapter you can charge your XA1 up quicker than you might expect.. USB type-c connectivity is a new addition to the XA1 and offers a connector that is fully reversible. Therefore when connecting a charging cable or data cable, right way up or wrong way round the cable will connect.. Also included is Bluetooth 4.2, NFC and GPS.. It seems crazy to suggest that the 5” screen on the XA1 is small in today's mobile world, but with a trend for bigger screens, the XA1 sits at the lower end of the scale for screen real estate.. This is a good thing though as the device retains a form factor that is smaller and more mobile in hand and often more comfortable in a pocket.. The 720p HD resolution offers a blend of screen quality and battery efficiency.. Lots of phones now have a 1080p HD display or better but they are known for drawing power. Unless you are into your media, for most of what we do on a phone, the 720p resolution is more than adequate.. Who needs to read their emails or an e-book in HD?. Gone are the thick and chunky borders that once framed a screen, the XA1’s display is almost edgeless. The smooth rounded form has the screen almost slip away into the edge of the handset and ultimately helps not only the look but in hand comfort of this phone.. Just 8mm thick and 143g this is no heavy piece of tech to carry with you.. Perhaps where the Sony really comes into its own is with the camera. What great shots it can achieve.. Sparing the really technical speak, Sony has included some really clever technology inside the phone, both hardware and software that helps the camera capture amazing photos, in good and even low light situations.. You have the benefit of a front facing wide-angle 8 MP selfie camera as well as a rear-mounted 23 MP camera with LED flash.. The F2.0 aperture sensor means more pixels and more light which in turn delivers best-in-class images.. Capture images that help you re-live the scene as you remember it.. Steady shot technology and fast auto-focus help reduce blur for a crisp, clear and in focus image.. View, edit and share right from the XA1 and share with the world if you want.. For a smartphone that does not break the bank, fits comfortably in the hand, has a good specification and can help you negotiate modern life, the XA1 has you covered..

User Reviews of Sony Xperia XA1. 9 Ratings 1 Reviews. 5 3. 4 0. 3 5. 2 0. 1 1. Rate & review this product and help other customers. The touch wasn't working for 1 month. After giving it in the service center, again after 15 days it stopped working. Customer service people are asking to contact with service center. They are not going to provide any kind of replacement even if the issue repeats. I wasted my money and for each service they are taking minimum of 25 days. Camera and performance are good, but if the touch does not work it is useless. This is the only thing I can do. Reviewed on MySmartPrice. Report spam 0 0. Sony mobile price list in India.
