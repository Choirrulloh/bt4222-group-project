The Microsoft Kin TWOm is a good feature phone sure to please frequent texters.. The Microsoft Kin TWOm is Microsoft's update to the poorly conceived Kin Two. Although the phone remains largely the same, its price has been cut significantly, along with some of its key features. But there is still enough here to wholeheartedly recommend the Kin TWOm to anyone with an itch for texting in the market for a feature phone .. Samsung Intensity II SCH-U460 (Verizon Wireless). The Kin TWOm is priced at $49.99 with a signed two-year contract or $219.99 without. It is being sold as a feature phone with a range of 3G data plans, which include pay-as-you-go $1.99 per MB, $15.00 for 150 MB or $29.99 for unlimited data.. Physically, the phone is virtually identical to the Kin Two; read our Kin Two review for a rundown of the phone's physical features, voice performance, and battery life. Here we're going to focus on what's different, and whether or not the Kin TWOm is a better value than the Kin Two was.. Kin One and Kin Two: A History. The original Microsoft Kin line was a pretty interesting failure. The Kin One and Kin Two looked like smartphones, sounded like smartphones and sort of worked like smartphones. But they weren't smartphones, even though they were priced like it. It was this strange middle groundfeature phone with benefits at a premium pricethat likely proved to be the nail in the Kin's coffin.. The original Kin line was shelved on June 30, a mere 48 days and less than 9,000 units after being introduced to the market. Just last week Verizon sent a letter to customers explaining that Kin Studio, the cloud service that allows Kin users free and unlimited storage of their photos, videos and contacts on Microsoft's servers, will be closing permanently on January 31, 2011.. All of this news adds up to sound like a death knell for the Kin, so it seemed like a curious decision when Verizon began to sell the rebranded Kin ONEm and Kin TWOm last month at a lower price tag and without the mandatory data plan.. According to a Verizon spokesperson, the new phones are meant to "provide an option for customers who liked the form factor of the previous Kin phones but want an Internet-capable device that doesn't require a data plan.". That is exactly what they do.. Social Networking: As mentioned, Facebook is no longer built in, although social networking sites may be accessed via web browser. We're sad to see this feature go, as the Kin line is still primarily being marketed as a social networking device for teens, but it is understandable given its new feature phone platform.. Kin Studio: Verizon is closing up shop on Kin Studio. This means that users of the Kin TWOm only have their phone's internal memory for data storage; it also means that if you want to download your photos from your phone, you have to use Microsoft's Windows-only Zune software. With only 8GB, the Kin TWOm doesn't pack much memory for users who want to store lots of music, record video or take a bunch of photos with the phone's 8-megapixel camera. The beauty of Kin Studio was that, with unlimited storage on Microsoft's servers, storage was a non issue. Current phones with removable storage can take up to 32 GB cards, so this omission is a major shortcoming.. This also means that the phone's address book doesn't sync up with anything. So be prepared to enter all of your contacts by hand to get started.. The Loop and The Spot: The Loop and The Spot have been completely done away with as well, as they directly designed to make use of the phone's built-in social networking capacity. While these features were fun and innovative, they are not completely necessary for a feature phone. They do not appear in the new software.. Zune Pass: No, it isn't gone, but Zune Pass is now available through Wi-Fi and sideload only. On one hand, it's nice to see that this feature is still available. On the other, just how useful will it prove to be when limited strictly to Wi-Fi connectivity? Being able to use Zune Pass through the 3G network was a big plus for the original Kin, so we will miss this feature.. The Kin TWOm is a pretty solid phone overall. What it lacks in downloadable apps and instant messaging ability it makes up for with a capable HTML web browser and good email support (including presets for Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo and AOL accounts). It also supports threaded messaging, which is a great feature that will certainly appeal to frequent texters. Control of the phone is nice and speedy, thanks to its NVIDIA APX2600 chipset. And compared to other similar feature phones, well, the Kin TWOm just looks cooler.. Comparisons between the Kin ONEm and Kin TWOm are inevitable. The Kin TWOm one-ups the Kin ONEm with a better camera, more storage space, and a larger screenbut it also lists for $100 more. Functionally, the phones are so similar, it ultimately comes down to a matter of taste. I suspect the tiny, quirky Kin ONEm will appeal to a younger audience. The Kin TWOm looks more like a smartphone, and will appeal to those looking for a more conventional messaging phone.. Overall the Kin TWOm holds it own in a class of fully capable messaging phones like the Samsung Intensity II ($29.99, 3 stars), LG Cosmos (Free, 3 stars), or LG Octane ($99.99, 3 stars).That makes recommending this device simple. The Microsoft Kin TWOm is a good feature phone and sure to please anyone looking for a simple, well priced device with an emphasis on texting..

Ask a Question Start a Discussion. Tell us about your experience with our site. I have a Microsoft Kin TWOm. Is there a manual I can refer to? I have a few thin booklets that came with the phone, including some quick guides, but none of the usual manual that would teach me the details on this phone's use.. For example, are there arrow keys? When I type, I've been having to delete back words until I get to the right spot for a correction. And today, I dialed the wrong #, and wanted to end the call right away, but couldn't find an "end call" command on the screen. or on the phone to press. I had to shut the phone off, which of course, wasn't quick enough. I have the same question (6). In reply to Radar2004's post on December 26, 2010. I couldn't find any arrow buttons. Sure with it had them though!. A fraction of a second after you press the "Call" button the screen will change.. The "Call" button will be replaced with an "End Call" button. If you press it fast enough you'll end the call before it goes through. Buy online, pick up in store.

Please read the description at the top where it says "This is not a GSM device, it will not work on any GSM network worldwide".

I hope this phone is no longer being sold. My first Kin TwoM died on vacation from more than normal humidity. When I was gettting a replacement, a Verizon worker flat out told me it was the worst phone ever sold. I was sent the wrong replacement. A month later I got my third phone hoping it would work better. Same problem as the others- constantly shuts off for no reason. Like, at least five times daily constantly. If you like a barely functioning piece of plastic, this is the phone for you! I hate Verizon for selling this phone. They also lost my original, claiming I never sent it back (FALSE) and charged me hundreds.. Katsidaa, 22 Aug 2011 Okay so this phone SUCKS! honestly I wanna chuck it in a river cause I can't stand. more Mine had the same problem I ended up using my lg wire to charge and it ended up working. The lg wire is has a think end to it so it doesnt move around much it sticks in there.. Okay so this phone SUCKS! honestly I wanna chuck it in a river cause I can't stand. It anymore and now it doesn't charge like ummm... Never had this problem before and it's obviously the phone that doesn't want to charge I've tried several different chargers and not one works unless you hold it in a completely weird way. My phone always shuts off and I think it's so stupid I doesn't have a memorie card spot. I'm upset with this phone please don't get it. Does well as a feature (not-smart) phone. Good for people who like to text a lot (threaded sms, qwerty, etc.) The internet browser is alright, has wifi, no tabs though. Camera has high resolution but poor lighting and focus.. it has everything you would ever need on a feature phone. The "m" version has dropped the social network services (SNS) application. It also does not contain an MS Office or PDF viewer application. This phone does not allow downloadable applications either.. mine ALWAYS shuts off and the camera is all screwed up. Pages: 1 2 3 ».

We warned you they would be back —and look who just swaggered into town today, as if they never even got killed off by Microsoft. Should've picked better aliases, though—Kin ONEm and Kin TWOm is just plain weird.. The Microsoft Kin Is Coming Back To Life On Verizon Read more Read. The Microsoft Kin One and Kin Two—which were killed off six weeks after launching—are coming back…. The Kin ONEm is selling for $120 and the Kin TWOm almost double that, at $220. That's straight-up, without a contract, but if you're prepared to sign on the dotted line for two years, the phones can be picked up for $20 and $50 respectively. Unlike Apple whacking an "S" on the end of a revamped iPhone 3G, Microsoft's new "m"-packing phones don't seem to have any new tricks for the youngsters.

Also, this touchscreen phone has a slide-out keyboard that is easy to operate, thanks to its generous spacing and backlighting.. by babysittingjake Jun 23, 2016. Sharp Kin TWOm was a great windows phone. The browser could not be updated from IE6. If there was a way I could not find it. I was unable to download my own ringtones or have any apps. Even the default search engine doesn't exist any longer (which cannot be changed either...) I was unable to sync my contacts over to it without going to the Verizon store. I really wish Kin, Verizon, Sharp (any of them) would have continued the line because I loved the phone, it just isn't up to date any longer and I am not Techy enough to find how to get it there. by earm7057 Jul 25, 2016. Enjoy the simplicity of this phone and has an excellent camera. Only drawback then ringer volume could be louder.. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned. by omdno1 Aug 05, 2014. One of a kind WiFi machine!. This one of the only great feature phones that gives you wifi. You won't get all of what smart phones offer but..who needs all that junk. I can stream kittens at my home pc, i have no time for that junk on the go. What i love about this phone is that it looks sleek and has some cool features. But most of all, i can use wifi anywhere. Believe me, you don't need more. Best of all, you can look over at people playing with their ringtones and rudely looking at stupid videos while others talk to them, and know you aren't paying a hefty data fee like they are. My only gripe is, i wish they still made more of these or made something like it but no..cell phone companies are trying too hard to jam smart phones down our throats. Honestly, i think smart phones i n general, cause accidents too..but don't get me going on that. I'm hoping that i can keep using this long enough to where data will one day, finally be free. Then I will cross over but for now..im happy with this gem. by jrfreeman3 May 15, 2012. This phone has the potential of being something amazing! Since the apps for Facebook, Twitter and MySpace have been removed in this edition and you have to access these social sites directly from the built in browser, there is not much demand for this phone at this time. Microsoft has discontinued developing the Kin OS and apps to go with it. Despite these set-backs, this phone does a wonderful job organizing your songs and it's reception as a phone is above average. There is no voice dial feature when hooked to a Bluetooth device, but the interface is easy to navigate. As a simple touchscreen phone, this one is amazing! It does not require the data package and in my humble opinion, it is the best phone you can get without being forced to subscribe to the infamous Verizon data plan.. by buycali Jul 23, 2012. Great phone at a great price!. If You are looking for a great phone without a data plan this is a great buy. It has a slide out keyboard which is extremely easy to use. The texting interface is really convenient and user friendly. The phone also comes with a built in Zune player which allows you to view movies, play songs, display photos and even listen to FM radio. The phone is great for someone on a budget that wants a nice looking fully functional phone. With an 8mp camera on board how can you go wrong with this Verizon wireless feature phone..

Just this April 2014, the company released a new mobile operating system that they called Windows Phone 8.1. The Windows Phone 7 was first introduced at the Mobile World Congress in Spain, particularly in. Barcelona and was released in the public in the United States of America. The Windows Phone 8 was then released in 2012 with the introduction of the new mobile operating system. It replaced the initial CE-based architecture of the Windows Phone 7. It allowed the acquisition of Windows NT kernel architecture to be able to port applications among both platforms.. Related Other American Wireless Handheld Device Motorola. The Windows Phone 8.1 was then announced in April 2, 2014 where new features were added from the previous phone. These features include a new notification center where users can easily see updated and messages upped on their phones. The Internet Explorer 11 was first introduced using the phone and allowed tab syncing with other Windows 8.1 devices.. On the hardware part, the two volume rockers of the device were separated in this model. They also included a third column of the Windows live tiles to the start screen of the device to allow users to add more application icons on handy.This version also has a voice assistant similar to Apple ’s Siri and the Google Now.

Pathfinder Tags: feature phone Kin Two Kin TWOm microsoft Sharp Verizon wi-fi wifi. Verizon and Microsoft jointly announced the Kin One and Kin. Two smartphones with a large marketing campaign on May 6 th. the end of June, the devices were pulled from shelves do to very disappointing. The problem with these devices was that they were classified as. smartphones that required expensive data packages, but didn't have the high-end. features of the iPhone or Android handsets.. Fast-forward five months later and the phones have been. rereleased by Verizon, this time dubbed the Kin ONEm and Kin TWOm (m is for. The rereleased phones are now marketed as "feature phones" without. Debundling the Kins from the data plans was all it. took to transform them from the worst smartphone to the best feature phone.. The first thing you should do when opening your new Kin is to disable the data connection if you don't want extra charges showing up on your account. You can do this by logging onto the Verizon Wireless. After logging in, click on Change Features, scroll to the bottom and. There will be an option to Block All Data Services. don't start racking up huge data fees on your account. settings is the option to turn WiFi network discovery on.. Even without constant internet access, I have found my email. update throughout the day whenever the device catches a random network. only that, but the few times I've needed to use the internet browser so far, I. the Kin ONEm and Kin TWOm:. Because of the lack of a data plan on these phones, many of the built-in social. networking and cloud storage features have been removed from the device. addition, a feature called The Spot, which let users share content, has also. There are a few new applications that have been added to the modified Kins. first of which is a calendar app, which isn't syncable with your email calendar,. but lets you add events with customizable reminders. calculator, which is pretty self-explanatory and includes basic calculator. These applications, especially the calendar, were missing from the. original release and drew the ire of critics.. Other features of the Kin Two include 8GB of internal storage, a 3-row slide. out QWERTY keyboard, an 8 MP camera w/ LED flash and 720p video recording,. threaded text messages, a favorites screen that allows you to program your top. contacts with pictures of each, access to Zune Pass, an FM radio tuner, mp3. It is yet to be seen if these devices will get any future software updates or. new apps such as the instant messenger (IM) client that was rumored to be. coming before the phone was pulled over the summer. for the relaunched device, but even if sales are good, I wouldn't get my hopes. too high since Microsoft is focusing on the Windows Phone 7 platform.. The lack of IM client was the one thing that had me hesitant, but after. learning about AIM over SMS , I was content enough with that solution.. Even though the resurrection of this phone could be come to. an end at any time if sales remain low or if stock runs out, the 8MP camera,. 720p video recording, and WiFi internet sold me on this device that lands. somewhere between a feature phone and a smartphone, especially considering the. If you need internet access 24/7 then move along, but if. you're a text-er who is in the market for a new phone without a data plan, this. is by far the best option currently available..

Comments rated to be Good Answers:. " Re: Review: Microsoft Kin TWOm / Kin Two " by. These comments received enough positive ratings to make. Re: Review: Microsoft Kin TWOm / Kin Two. I also just purchased this phone and Verizon has the old Kin One and Kin Two Manual on their site and many functions in the Manual are not on the Kin OneM and Kin TwoM phones, including MS Exchange pre-listed on the e-mail screen, which was to be used to import your contacts into the phone by using Live. G-Mail is there but that also does not import contacts. It must have worked with just the Kin Two, but not with the recent M series, so many people who have bought this newer version with software removed are asking how you can get contacts into the phone. It appears there is no way. If anyone figures it out, I'd love to know. It has many other functions for only a feature phone that are nice.. Re: Review: Microsoft Kin TWOm / Kin Two. I actually had the same issue importing contacts. I thought I would be able to import them through Gmail or Hotmail but was unsuccessfull. I ended up putting them in manually which was a bit of a pain but only took me an hour to put in over 50 contacts. Definitely annoying, but 1 hour of manual entry over the course of the entire time you own the phone didn't seem too bad when looked at that way.. Re: Review: Microsoft Kin TWOm / Kin Two. I also have this phone and its great for what it is a feature phone with out the need of a data plan. Also about the contacts I have read people having issues but verizon transfered mine from my windows mobile 6.1 with no problem. My dad got one and they transfered his contacts perfectly fine from his old flip phone too so if possible have verizon do it for you and there shouldn't be any issues.. Re: Review: Microsoft Kin TWOm / Kin Two. I have been very interested in this phone because of the wifi capabilities despite the lack of a data plan. My main concern is that Verizon will release a new feature phone soon that will be superior and also be wifi compatible. Do you think this is likely, or do you think the Kin will be unique in this regard because it is a "downgraded" smartphone?. Re: Review: Microsoft Kin TWOm / Kin Two. Something newer/better is always around the corner but I think the Kin TWOm is still ahead of its time with the wifi capabilities and other smartphone-like features.. CES is this week and Verizon is having a big fanfare for its 4G network launch with the HTC Thunderbolt 4G and other high-end devices. With emphasis on these, its doubtful that Verizon would release a high-end feature phone to compete with itself. (They want people to be forced into data plans). The only reason these features are available on the Kin is beacuse of its failure as a smartphone.. Eventually I think you will see Android on feature-phones but that could be at least a year away still. The one device which was rumored to be an Android feature-phone, the Env Pro, has been delayed or canceled.. Re: Review: Microsoft Kin TWOm / Kin Two. its a really good phone! for an example if forget your ipod or if it dies your phone is a back up for music! thats why i love it!!!. Re: Review: Microsoft Kin TWOm / Kin Two. Verizon is obviously trying to push people into the smartphone market to get that $30 extra/month so I doubt they're going to give us anything new in the feature phone dept that's truly appealing. I'm one of the few people that has had an enV touch last the full contract term(well close, knock on wood) without the touch screen wigging out(my wife's, not so lucky). I've really liked the phone and haven't seen anything in the feature phone list from LG that I even care to look at. I'm guessing that I'm going to go with Kin TWOm for the good camera, touch screen, qwerty, and simply for lack of a better choice. Of course I'd like one of the smartphones but I'm stubborn and can't justify the extra money for the data plan. If they had a 1gig plan for $10-$15, I'd probably jump on that..

The Microsoft Kin ONEm is a good, low-priced feature phone sure to appeal to tweens and teens.. The Microsoft Kin ONEm is Microsoft's update to the poorly conceived Kin One. Although the phone remains largely the same, its price has been cut significantly, along with some of its key features. Strangely, less is more here: an inadequate smartphone has become a charming feature phone .. Samsung Intensity II SCH-U460 (Verizon Wireless). The Kin ONEm is priced at $19.99 with a signed two-year contract, or $119.99 without. It is being sold as a feature phone with a range of 3G data plans, which include pay-as-you-go $1.99 per MB, $15.00 for 150 MB or $29.99 for unlimited data.. Physically, the phone is virtually identical to the Kin One; read our Kin One review for a rundown of the phone's physical features, voice performance, and battery life. Here we're going to focus on what's different, and whether or not the Kin ONEm is a better value than the Kin One was.. Kin One and Kin Two: A History. The original Microsoft Kin line was a pretty interesting failure. The Kin One and Kin Two looked like smartphones, sounded like smartphones and sort of worked like smartphones. But they weren't smartphones, even though they were priced like it. It was this strange middle groundfeature phone with benefits at a premium pricethat likely proved to be the nail in the Kin's coffin.. The original Kin line was shelved on June 30, a mere 48 days and less than 9,000 units after being introduced to the market. Just last week Verizon sent a letter to customers explaining that Kin Studio, the cloud service that allows Kin users free and unlimited storage of their photos, videos and contacts on Microsoft's servers, will be closing permanently on January 31, 2011.. All of this news adds up to sound like a death knell for the Kin, so it seemed like a curious decision when Verizon began to sell the rebranded Kin ONEm and Kin TWOm last month at a lower price tag and without the mandatory data plan.. According to a Verizon spokesperson, the new phones are meant to "provide an option for customers who liked the form factor of the previous Kin phones but want an Internet-capable device that doesn't require a data plan.". That is exactly what they do.. Social Networking: As mentioned, Facebook is no longer built in, although social networking sites may be accessed via web browser. We're sad to see this feature go, as the Kin line is still primarily being marketed as a social networking device for teens, but it is understandable given its new feature phone platform.. Kin Studio: Verizon is closing up shop on Kin Studio. This means that users of the Kin ONEm only have their phone's internal memory for data storage; it also means that if you want to download your photos from your phone, you have to use Microsoft's Windows-only Zune software. With only 4GB, the Kin ONEm doesn't pack much memory for users who want to store lots of music, record video or take a bunch of photos with the phone's 5-megapixel camera. The beauty of Kin Studio was that, with unlimited storage on Microsoft's servers, storage was a non issue. Current phones with removable storage can take up to 32 GB cards, so this omission is a major shortcoming.. This also means that the phone's address book doesn't sync up with anything. So be prepared to enter all of your contacts by hand to get started.. The Loop and The Spot: The Loop and The Spot have been completely done away with as well, as they directly designed to make use of the phone's built-in social networking capacity. While these features were fun and innovative, they are not completely necessary for a feature phone. They do not appear in the new software.. Zune Pass: No, it isn't gone, but Zune Pass is now available through Wi-Fi and sideload only. On one hand, it's nice to see that this feature is still available. On the other, just how useful will it prove to be when limited strictly to Wi-Fi connectivity? Being able to use Zune Pass through the 3G network was a big plus for the original Kin, so we will miss this feature.. The Kin ONEm is a charming little feature phone. In our review of the Kin One we said, "The Microsoft Kin One could have been a cute messaging phone, but it's being sold as an underpowered smartphone.". Now that it is being sold as a feature phone, this criticism has been addressed. It certainly isn't the best feature phone on the marketthe screen is still cramped and the non-expandable memory is only 4 gigsbut the new pricing plan instantly makes it more appealing than the Kin One ever was.. Not only that, but the Kin is a pretty solid phone overall. What it lacks in downloadable apps and instant messaging abilities it makes up for with a capable HTML web browser and good email support (including presets for Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo and AOL accounts). It supports threaded messaging, which is a great feature that will certainly appeal to frequent texters. And the phone still has a surprisingly spacious keyboard given its tiny size, as well as a general elegance in its build often lacking in other phones at this price point.. Comparisons between the Kin ONEm and Kin TWOm are inevitable. The Kin TWOm one-ups the Kin ONEm with a better camera, more storage space, and a larger screenbut it also lists for $100 more. Functionally, the phones are so similar, it ultimately comes down to a matter of taste. I suspect the tiny, quirky Kin ONEm will appeal to a younger audience. The Kin TWOm looks more like a smartphone, and will appeal to those looking for a more conventional messaging phone.. The Kin ONEm stands up tall in a class of messaging phones like the Samsung Intensity II ($29.99, 3 stars), LG Cosmos (Free, 3 stars), or LG Octane ($99.99, 3 stars). That makes recommending this phone easy. The Microsoft Kin ONEm is definitely a viable option for the tween (or adult with a sense of whimsy) who wants a cute, simple little phone to make calls and text friends.. Bottom Line: The Microsoft Kin ONEm is a good, low-priced feature phone sure to appeal to tweens and teens.. Alex Colon is the managing editor of PCMag's consumer electronics team.

By ZBarangan on December 27, 2010. Senior Friendly Features: Large Display Screen:. Microsoft has themselves a pretty solid phone in the Kin TWOm. In what could be the last installment in the Kin series, the TWOm serves best as a messaging phone for those who are big-time texters. Threaded messaging and a nice keyboard make for a nice touch. The TWOm is a step-up from the ONEm in that it’s got a larger screen, camera, memory, and price-tag.. Spotlight Review: Microsoft Kin ONEm Smartphone. Senior Friendly Features: Large Display Screen:. Microsoft’s Kin ONEm is a small little device that is big on features but may be difficult for some to adapt to. The small touchscreen’s sensitivity leaves a little to be desired, and the QWERTY slide-out keyboard is a bit too small to be that effective. However, the phone’s 5.0 mega-pixel camera is a nice bonus for those who are love to use their phones to snap pictures.. 0 Responses to Spotlight Review: Microsoft Kin TWOm Smartphone. February 26, 2011 at 9:57 am. I am the guy who is too cheap to get a smart phone and pay the added $30.00 so I carried a phone and an Ipod Touch. Almost everywhere I go is wireless so I did not see the need for data plan. I have had the Kin Two M and I love this phone. I have a huge music and video library loaded on it as well as all my photos. This was all loaded through the very easy to use Zune on my PC. I can listen to my sports radio on the fm radio. It is the perfect phone for me. My kids love the phone too I am afraid this will not be available when it is time for them to upgrade. My advise, get this phone before it is gone forever. It is the best feature phone out there!. Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply..
