more ... more .... more ... more .... The new Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3 is an affordable Android 6.0 Marshmallow phone with a metal body. The new Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3 is an affordable Android 6.0 Marshmallow phone with a metal body. posted by Mihai A.. Tags :. Android - Android + Asus - Asus +. A few weeks ago, Asus took the wraps off its new Zenfone 3 series by announcing the Zenfone 3 , the Zenfone 3 Deluxe , and the Zenfone 3 Ultra. Now the Asus Zenfone 3 series has a new member. Meet the Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3, a budget smartphone with promising specs. Before we get to the details of the Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3, it's worth pointing out that the handset will be priced at CNY 1,300 (the equivalent of $200 at the current conversion rates) in China, the first market where Asus plans to launch the smartphone. The standard version of the Zenfone 3, which the cheapest handset in the series available at the moment, is priced at $249.99. One thing that stands out about the Pegasus 3 when compared to the regular Zenfone 3 is that the new handset adopts an all-metal construction instead of the glass-and-metal sandwich build.. Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3: metallic build, Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and a large battery at a decent price. Under hood beats the heart of a 1.3GHz quad-core processor of currently unknown make. On the memory side, two versions of the Pegasus 3 will be available; one comes with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage while the other features 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.. On the software side, the Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3 runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow overlaid with the manufacturer's ZenfUI 3.0. In the camera department, the Zenfone Pegasus 3 offers a 13MP primary camera and a 5MP selfie shooter on the front, which represents a downgrade compared to the 16MP / 8MP camera setup featured by the regular Zenfone 3. Other specs include a fingerprint reader located on the back of the handset, dual-SIM capabilities, and a capacious 4,100mAh battery that should provide plenty of uptime given the relatively low power requirements of the hardware. At this point, it's unknown when or if Asus will launch the Pegasus 3 outside of the Asian continent. What do you guys think, is anyone hoping for the Zenfone Pegasus 3 to make it to the US?.

You may better know Asus as a computer brand but they also make some pretty good phones. The Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3 is the smartphone that costs just $150, it is made out of metal and it is beautiful.. Learn more in our full review.. Thanks to Gearbest for sending. Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3 for a review.. The Pegasus 3 comes in a rather simple box and inside of it you can find a charger, USB cable and some paperwork.. Design is definitely one of the strong points of this device. The phone sports a metal shell, except for the plastic top and bottom parts for antennas.. I love the way the device feels in the hand due to rounded corners on the back and due to the fact that it is a rather compact phone.. We have a 5.2” display, which only has 720p resolution. Still, it is a pretty good LCD panel and it should be enough for most users. The only shortcoming is that it could have a slightly better sunlight legibility.. It’s great that the phone has a notification LED light, which sits next to the 5MP selfie shooter. However, we only have the on-screen navigation buttons that cannot be customized. Well, at least you can press the multitasking button to take a screenshot.. As for optics, we have a 13MP shooter and a single LED flash.. The fingerprint scanner is pretty accurate and it unlocks your phone straight from the standby mode. However, it is not the fastest I’ve seen, especially if you want to use it a couple of times in a row. On the other hand, if you don’t need to unlock our phone every 2 seconds, the fingerprint sensor works just fine.. The loudspeaker can get pretty loud but don’t expect very good sound quality. You can tweak the audio settings if you want but my biggest concern is that the sound gets a little distorted at the highest volume settings.. The metal-made buttons do not rattle and they have a good tactile response.. The $150 Asus Pegasus 3 is not going to be your next flagship device as it sports a quad-core MTK6737 chip with the max. clock speeds of 1.3GHz, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, which can be expanded via the microSD card slot.. The 720p display means that the phone doesn’t need to push too many pixels and thus, the gaming performance is good. I played a few games on the highest graphics and there were just a few skipped frames. Finally, the phone does not have any overheating issues.. As for user interface performance, it is pretty good too as I didn’t have any lag or hiccups.. As for the UI itself, the phone runs on the Asus ZenUI, which is built on top of Android 6.0. It’s up to you whether you like the looks of it but you can always download a third-party launcher.. We have a few added features, customization options and pre-installed apps to play with. Just to name a few, you can turn on the blue light filter of the display or select from a variety of gesture and motion controls that work pretty well. Finally, a photo-collage app allows you to stitch a few photos if you feel creative.. The 13MP camera takes pictures fast. We have a few shooting modes but many of them require a tripod to get usable photos.. I took most of the shots using the auto-mode and the daylight picture quality is really good for a $150 phone. There is a decent amount of detail, and the images look pretty sharp. However, dynamic range adjustment is usually off.. In general, cheap phones don’t take great photos in low-light. The Pegasus 3 will not impress you but it is not that bad either. You can get some okay looking shots considering the category of this phone.. The selfie camera, however, could be better. Images have quite a lot of noise and the level of detail is pretty low.. The 1080p video quality is pretty good for the class. As usual to most of the cheap phones, there is no continuous auto-focus feature. See a video review for a video sample .. When it comes to connectivity, the Asus Pegasus 3 will not disappoint you.. It comes with a dual-SIM card tray, which can take either 2 SIMs or 1 SIM and the microSD card.. The call quality and signal reception are good, the GPS is fast and accurate. The Wifi also works fine but the phone does not always reconnect to the last used Wifi network, which is kind of annoying and hopefully this will be fixed soon. Also, keep in mind that the phone does not support 5GHz connection.. One of the key highlights of the phone is a huge 4100mAh battery that performs very well. I could get almost 7 hours of screen-on on a mixed use that translates to at least 1.5 or 2 days of usage.. Also, you can use a variety of power saving options to get even better results.. However, the phone does not support quick charging feature and it takes around 4 hours to fully charge it.. The Asus Pegasus 3 is the cheapest phone from their Zenfone line and it is a pretty good phone for the price.. It is well-constructed and feels premium due to its metal build, it performs well whether you use the phone for basic tasks or gaming. Also, the phone takes great photos in daylight and it has a fantastic battery life.. On the other hand, you have to know that the phone sports only a 720p resolution display, and you can’t switch the position of on-screen navigation buttons.. Although the selfie camera may be enough for social media, the image quality does not impress. Also, there is no 5GHz Wifi support and the sometimes the phone struggles reconnecting to the last used Wifi network. Finally, the phone’s battery life may be fantastic but it does not support fast charging feature.. At the end of the day, the Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3 has a few shortcomings like most of the cheap phones but it is still a good buying option at the price of just $150..

The Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3 is no mythical creature, and is very affordable. With three phones already under the Zenfone 3 moniker, Asus announced. the Zenfone Pegasus 3 , yet another addition to the company’s latest family of phones.. Rocking an all-metal design, the Zenfone Pegasus 3 sports. a 5.2-inch, 1,280 x 720p resolution display, with curved glass on the sides. Above the display sits a 5-megapixel camera, while its rear-facing equivalent weighs in at 13MP with a single LED flash module. Similar to the rest of the Zenfone 3 family of phones, the Zenfone Pegasus 3 also features a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor.. Taking a look at the inside,. a 1.3GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6737 processor sits as the Zenfone Pegasus 3’s beating heart, with the amount of RAM determined by. either the 16GB (2GB RAM) or 32GB (3GB RAM) of native storage. If neither amount satisfies your storage needs, the MicroSD card slot should allay any fears. If you do not need the extra storage, however, that MicroSD card slot can be used. for your Nano SIM card, with the main card slot fitting a bigger Micro SIM.. Keeping the lights on is the Zenfone Pegasus 3’s ridiculously large 4,100mAh battery, which should be more than enough to. let you use the phone for a few days before it would need a top-up. Unfortunately, there is no mention of any quick-charge capabilities, so you might need to wait a while to fully charge that battery.. ZenUI 3.0 on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Similar to what we saw on the Zenfone 3 phone lineup during Computex in May,. this new version of ZenUI loses some of the bloat found on the Zenfone 2, but its cartoon-like appearance will annoy those who swear by vanilla. Alas, anyone outside of China interested in the Zenfone Pegasus 3 will need to import it, since Asus has yet to announce availability in other regions.. If it does, expect the phone to be very affordable, since it will launch in China with either a 1,299 Yuan ($197) price tag for the 16GB version or a 1,499 Yuan ($227) price point for the 32GB variant..

I received the wrong product, as you can see in the pictures the model's name and number on the sticker in the package is right, the picture of the phone with the name and model number on it is correct too, except for the cover itself, it is not for the model I asked, the cutouts and buttons are not aligned, unfortunately it will cost me more to resend this back to get a replacement. I'm sure the right cover will do wonders in this phone protecting it from drops, putting in on surfaces with the screen facing down because it doesn’t let the screen touch the surface and looking nice, also with the grip, with it on it feels secure to hold the phone due to the fact that this phone is very slippery without it..

Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3, nuevo gama media con traje premium. Recibe un email al día con nuestros artículos:. Compartir Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3, nuevo gama media con traje premium. El metal también es tendencia en gamas básicas. Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3, especificaciones técnicas. 149.5 x 73.7 x 8.6 mm (158 gramos). Octa core 64 bit a 1,3 GHz. 16/32 GB + MicroSD hasta 256 GB. 4G VoLTE, Bluetooth 4.0, Wi‑Fi 802.11 b/g/n, GPS. 13 megapíxeles con flash LED y lente f/2.2. Cámara frontal de 5 megapíxeles, lente f/2.0. Carcasa metálica, cristal 2.5D, lector de huellas trasero. Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3, precio y disponibilidad. Tras la sonada presentación de la nueva gama Asus Zenfone 3 en la pasada edición de la feria Computex, la compañía taiwanesa amplía su catálogo con el Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3 , un smartphone que se mueve entre las gamas media y de entrada y destaca sobre todo por su diseño metálico en varios tonos.. Aunque su nombre lo sitúa cerca de la serie Zenfone 3, lo cierto es que, según FoneArena , este modelo es un nuevo integrante de la familia Pegasus , su gama básica en Taiwán. Te contamos todo sobre el nuevo Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3.. La idea de gama media premium suena cada vez más en el panorama móvil y los diseños metálicos ya son habituales en terminales más modestos como este Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3.. El terminal cuenta con un diseño que no permite extraer la batería, igual que sus hermanos mayores. Por detrás el aluminio es el protagonista, y en este caso sí que hay líneas de antena cruzando la carcasa -no como su hermano Zenfone 3 Deluxe. En la parte trasera también nos encontramos con un sensor de huellas , situado justo bajo la cámara, para desbloquear el terminal o hacer pagos.. El frontal está cubierto por una lámina de cristal 2.5D, curvado en las esquinas para que la junta con el metal esté más suavizada. La pantalla, una IPS de 5,2 pulgadas en diagonal, desarrolla 1.280 x 720 píxeles y concentra 282 puntos por pulgada.. En el interior del Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3 hay un procesador de ocho núcleos a 64 bits del que, de momento, no han desvelado información concreta (aunque conociendo el historial de la gama Pegasus, tiene pinta de un Mediatek, probablemente el MT6750).. Llegará en dos versiones con distinta capacidad y memoria RAM. El modelo de 16 GB contará con 2 GB de RAM , mientras que la versión de 32 GB subirá a 3 GB. Los dos son ampliables con MicroSD hasta 256 GB adicionales.. La pareja de cámaras está formada por un sensor trasero de 13 megapíxeles , montado bajo una lente f/2.2, con enfoque automático, flash LED y grabación de vídeos FullHD. Para la cámara delantera la resolución baja a 5 megapíxeles , pero a cambio la lente amplía un poco la apertura (f/2.0).. También cuenta con conectividad 4G con VoLTE, Dual SIM, Android 6.0 de serie y una batería de 4.100 miliamperios de capacidad que promete una autonomía muy prolongada. Además, Asus se las ha apañado para integrarla en un chasis de 8,6 milímetros de grosor y 158 gramos, que no está nada mal.. El Asus Zenfone Pegasus 3 estará disponible en China a través de la tienda online de Asus, sin indicios de que vayamos a verlo fuera de Asia.. El modelo de 16 GB con 2 GB de RAM costará alrededor de 175 euros al cambio actual. Para la versión de 32 GB y 3 GB de RAM, el precio sube a 200 euros. Los dos se podrán comprar en dorado, plata, gris y el color de moda: oro rosado.. En Xataka Móvil | Tras 30 millones de unidades vendidas, ASUS se muestra optimista respecto a su línea ZenFone.

Hi, I bought the Pegasus 3 from Tinydeal (German warehouse) so I received it with Global ROM. Looked to be perfect, but I couldn't make or receive any phone calls because a message box kept popping up: ASUS calling screen has stopped. So then I tried updating the firmware (it said there was one available) but it stopped halfway during installation. After that I tried installing the new firmware manually, but I overlooked the "CN" part So I was stuck on Chinese ROM. It took some time, but following this tut: http://forum.xda-developers.com/show....php?t=1982587 and using this ROM: http://forum.xda-developers.com/gene...9#post69293999 I managed to get back to Global ROM. However; still the same problem! ASUS calling screen has stopped. Is there anybody who has an idea for me to fix it? I tried using Nova Launcher, but perhaps I should try a different dialer?. One other thing: my contacts don't sync with Google, and I can't add the Google account to ASUS contacts. But Calendar, Gmail etc are all there... I sincerely hope to be able to use this phone!.

I think I may have a clue on the issue; it seems the IMEI number is invalid. Probably after flashing the Global ROM using SP Flash tools?. So now I'm looking to edit IMEI number with MTK Droid Tool, but the device is not recognized. I installed MTK USB drivers, Android CDC drivers, tried PDAnet, ASUS PC-link but none of it works. First question; to use MTK Droid Tool, should the USB be used for Charging, File transfers or USB storage? USB-debugging is on. Second; what more can I do?. Join Date: Joined: Apr 2013. hello, your reseller seem to sell you a chinese asus version (check the firmware version if it CMCC... The asus X008 and asus zc520tl zenfione max 3 are the same. So if your firmware is CMCC .... nstall a fresh original rom with sp flashtools ( http://www.needrom.com/download/asus-x008/ ), when done download the updated rom from asus ( http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/Zen....0.12-user.zip ) and put it outside folders, restart the smartphone the update will be detected. I got the same problem as you before and now everything is ok I can call and receieve calls, the only hings is that there are only chinese and engliash languages and you have to install alternativbe store like apptoide because google services are not avalable on chinses rom..

I'm really stuck with this phone I can't use right now. What would be the best way to get it working again? Currently the IMEI is wrong, so I need to root my device in order to be able to use it. The ROM I'm using right now is the adapted CN version, but ofcourse I'd love to use the (real) WW version I noticed someone found on a Russian board. Join Date: Joined: Nov 2016. Turn on the permissions for Asus Calling Screen, they are off by default. ---------- Post added at 03:41 AM ---------- Previous post was at 03:31 AM ----------. And also to sync Google Contacts, you need to install Google Contacts Sync ( http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-...apk-download/) which is not installed on the ROM. The 6.0.1 version of the app works, but can't say the same for the 7.0. I believe it's because the system is Marshmallow and the version number reflects the system version.
