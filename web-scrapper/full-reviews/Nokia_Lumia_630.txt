Launched in June, 2014, the Nokia Lumia 630 is a likeable low-end phone with a wallet-friendly price tag.. Available SIM-free for just £65, Nokia’s Windows 8.1 handset is one of the cheapest Windows Phones on the market and good value for money, if you can look past its disappointing screen. For a fraction of the price more you can now pick up the successor to the Lumia 630, the Lumia 635 , which has added 4G and made some improvements in styling but little else aside.. User reviews for the Lumia 630 have generally been positive, touting excellent value for money and good design. The Lumia 630 faces stiff competition from one of our favourite ever budget handsets though, the Motorola Moto G – that will set you back twice the price.. SEE ALSO: Best Cheap Mobile Phones. As with most of the Nokia Lumia range, the Lumia 630 comes in a bright and colourful plastic shell.. If you’re after something a little more toned down you can get a black Lumia 630, but we imagine most buyers will be attracted to the more vibrant green and orange shades it’s available in.. We got hold of the orange Lumia 630, and it’s a real screaming highlighter-style shade. Our photos can’t really do it justice – it is that bright. The colour continues onto the phone’s buttons too, giving it an assured look that is often missing from cheaper phones.. SEE ALSO: Best Android Phones. Higher-end Lumias have a more robust and expensive feel, but the Lumia 630 has a good finish for such a budget handset. Texturing has been used in the plastic of the removable back to give it a bit of grip, and avoid the tacky feel of some cheap phones. That said, the 4G edition of this phone, the Lumia 635, does have a glossy, shiny finish, which makes it harder to grip.. One of the best features of the Nokia Lumia 630’s design is that everything is within easy reach. This is a mid-size phone, but Nokia still places the power button on the side rather than the top, meaning it sits right by where your thumb naturally rests (for right-handers at least).. SEE ALSO: Windows Phone 8.1 review. With the screen off, the Lumia 630 has some of the design purity of the Moto G – something generally missing from budget ZTE and Huawei rivals. There are no physical soft keys to label (this phone has software soft keys), and as the memory card and microSIM slots sit under the battery cover, there are no on-body trays to deal with. Nokia has also applied a tapering effect to the phone’s lines, providing an added sense of deliberation.. The Lumia 630 is a successful design, only lacking the dense, flex-free feel of the pricier Lumias.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

This is becoming a norm for budget phones, and while people’s impression of what constitutes a ‘large’ or ‘small’ phone is changing constantly, it offers a pretty great compromise between display size and accessibility.. What do we mean exactly? You can still pull down the notifications menu while holding the Lumia 630 in one hand, but you have enough space to type away accurately using Windows Phone 8.1 ’s keyboard.. Display quality is more of a mixed bag.. First, we’ll cover the good bits. Colour is OK for a phone of this price. There is a slight blue-ish-ness to the blacks that makes us think Nokia labelling this a ClearBlack display is pushing it a bit, but for £100 it performs reasonably well.. For the uninitiated, ClearBlack is a stamp Nokia puts on the phones it thinks offer really good displays that provide a vibrant, punchy image. There’s no particular display tech involved (there are both IPS and OLED ClearBlack screens), but it is a generally reliable seal of quality.. What we’re most pleased to see is no sense of the display being recessed far beyond the top layer. Less advanced IPS LCD screen types tend to look a little washed out, partly thanks to being made of a number of discrete layers between which are tiny air gaps. But the Lumia 630’s screen is pretty immediate and vital-looking.. Angled viewing diminishes the brightness a bit, but as with most IPS LCDs, viewing angles are generally very good – there’s no dramatic contrast shift.. The Lumia 630 display is 854 x 480 pixels in resolution, which is well below the 2014 standard for budget Android phones. We’d like to see devices of this size use at least 960 x 540 resolutions, if not 720p, as seen in the Moto G – a phone of roughly the same price.. This resolution also marks a step down in sharpness from last year’s budget Nokia Lumias, the excellent Lumia 620 and Lumia 520. Those phones use 800 x 480 resolution screens, but as they are so much smaller they both appear sharper than the Lumia 630. If you’re picky about screen quality, you probably won’t be 100 per cent happy with this phone.. SEE ALSO: Windows 10 Review. Windows Phone 8.1 emphasises the resolution issue too. It lets you fit more, smaller Live Tile shortcuts onto your phone’s home screen, showing off quite how blocky the screen appears next to more expensive phones.. It’s immediately obvious, and one of the most off-putting aspects of the Lumia 630.. Windows Phones have traditionally lagged behind the Android competition in terms of resolution. Once we could blame the software, as previous version of Windows Phone limited the resolutions available to phone manufacturers. But now that Windows Phones use everything from 480 x 800 pixels right up to 1080p, we can only assume it’s a pure cost issue.. The lack of adaptive brightness is another screen complaint. Most phones have an ambient light sensor in their screen surround, letting a mobile tell how bright the screen needs to be for any occasion. Here, you manually pick between ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’ backlight settings.. Having to flick between these as you move between outdoors and indoors is annoying, and technophobes who don’t realise they can do this may just end up thinking their Lumia 630 is merely indecipherable when used outside. Even at top brightness the phone struggles with a bright, sunny day.. The backlight is also quite inconsistent. There is a slightly dimmed area at the top that appears to be where the downward-firing backlight LEDs live. It’s a sign this isn’t a top-quality screen.. Nokia has got a few elements of the Lumia 630 display right, but others are way off.. Next Windows Phone 8.1 and Performance. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

Lacks a proximity sensor that turns the display оff during a phone call. Too little RAM memory (0.5 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (218 ppi). The Nokia Lumia 630 sports a 4.5-inch FWVGA display, 1.2 GHz processor, 512MB of RAM and 5-megapixels rear-facing camera without flash. The handset runs Windows Phone 8.1 and has dual SIM variant.. Nokia Lumia 630 vs Motorola Moto G Nokia Lumia 630 Review Nokia Lumia 630 manual Nokia Lumia 630 benchmarks. Dimensions: 5.10 x 2.63 x 0.36 inches (129.5 x 66.7 x 9.2 mm). Weight: 4.73 oz (134 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 4.5 inches. Resolution: 480 x 854 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 3). Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Panorama, Night mode, Scenes. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 16.40 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 25.0 days (600 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 13.10 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. Data: HSDPA+ (4G) 21.1 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s. Notifications: Music ringtones (MP3, WAV), Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. A-GPS, Glonass, Cell ID, Wi-Fi positioning. Navigation: Turn-by-turn navigation, Voice navigation, Points of interest (POI). Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars Otherwise if you already have a micro sim all you need to do is pop the sim in the phone and it works like a charm. For users in Trinidad and Tobago I can safely say this phone works with bmobile and degicel sim cards. The most you'll have to do is cut you sim card to a micro sim. Otherwise if you already have a micro sim all you need to do is pop the sim in the phone and it works like a charm. I would have given this phone 5/5 but I must there are two annoying features about this phone I don't like...one is the battery use. This is certainly NOT a phone for a person who is a heavy phone user. WIFI drains the battery life like water. The second part about this phone I don't like...or better yet didn't like is when I got this phone the guide was in Chinese also the whole settings on the phone was in Chinese.It took me a while to figure out how to change the language. If I wasn't tech savy it would have taken me all day. But overall this phone is pretty decent for the price.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Buy this phone to use in the Caribbean!. Bought this product with the sole purpose of using it in the Caribbean. The phone arrived on time and was most definitely brand new! However, the default language on the phone was Italian! I am barely functional in Spanish and have no knowledge of Italian ( other than being able to recognize the language). My little knowledge of Spanish gave me enough to recognize some cognates and to play around on the phone until I got to " Settings" and " Lingua" ( 15 minutes later)....once I got the phone to English, it was smooth sailing. I temporarily got an H2O micro SIM card installed and tested out the features. My first time using windows 8 but no problem, simple to navigate. I love that I get Whatspp already installed and many other cool apps. Cortana is wonderful! I may not be able to make full use of her in the Caribbean but she does add a certain level of class to the phone! Once I got to the Caribbean I was able to get their LIME network to cut my old standard SIM ( from my last visit there) down to a micro SIM and I was all set. I had all my contacts from my old phone SIM. I have added the Kindle app to read my Amazon books; Netflix and Trac Runner. I always loaded Twitter, Facebook, WEChat and many other apps. I do not like the standard keyboard though, my fingers keep getting the wrong letter...I think the keyboard design could have been better. There is no front camera but I take selfies with LUMIA SELFIE app and that's fine. I got a great phone at a great price of ($99.00). I would recommend this phone if you are planning to use it in the Caribbean! Be sure to get the Factory Unlocked International version!. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent. Wow! This phone has so much to offer. I saw a comparison on YouTube between Lumia 630 and Iphone 5 and as you can see it for yourself there are not many differences. But once that I got this Phone I'm really glad I bought it. Is everything that I expect it and more. I don't see the use of writing down specifications, because you can look for that in other reviews. But for business use is perfect. It's a friendly phone, I love that I don't have to learn another technology, I'm used to windows and now I have a windows phone!. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Chinese phone... Not sure this product I received was new like the ad claims. The factory seal was already cut and the charger shows signs of wear and tear. This also appears to be a china phone, all the manuals are in Chinese and upon reset, the phone starts up in Chinese. I just hope this is a nokia original phone and not a Chinese clone. I gave it five stars though as these windows 8.1 phones are great phones. I have both flagship android phones and a couple windows 8.1 phones and the windows phones have always been rock solid, never needing a reboot or anything, unlike android. With that said, I do still love my android phones too. Each serves a purpose and they both do it well. The rating I gave is for the windows phone itself and not about the seller. I'll rate the seller separately in regards to the opened seal and it possibly not being a new phone.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars It's kinda funky because windows OS requires me to use off-brand apps which is fine considering they function identically to the. Not sure, this thing was my first smartphone. It's kinda funky because windows OS requires me to use off-brand apps which is fine considering they function identically to the apple and android versions and communicate with those versions as well... Phone has two sim slots which is great, and a host of good features. No flash on the camera means no great flashlight, and the timer apps really suck. (matters as I work in coffee, and need to measure time always). Phone seems to get pretty average to poor reception most places and runs a bit slower than I'd expect. Close your apps as they won't close themselves and will kill your battery instead. But it's a hundred freaking dollars. Let's face it, a good flip phone is forty, a bad smartphone can be 100 and still be quite valuable.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars This is a very nice phone and easy to use. This is a very nice phone and easy to use. We did have one problem that aggravated the daylights out of us. I do not understand why a phone purchased in the US came to us all in Chinese. I know all we have to do it change the language but think about trying to do that when all we have is symbols. I do not know if this was a joke or if they all come that way. But it was not funny or fun,.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars I found out this phone was not unlocked after I .... I found out this phone was not unlocked after I got overseas!!!

It's full of new features and a step up from anything Nokia has had to offer in the entry level Windows Phone category so far.. Update: The Nokia Lumia 630 is becoming cheaper all the time and new phones have arrived to challenge it, including newer Lumia handsets. With the Nokia Lumia 520 now the world's top-selling Windows Phone 8 handset, it's no surprise that Nokia and Microsoft are concentrating on strengthening their low-budget range as it tries to dominate an area of the market.. The Nokia Lumia 630 was the first Windows Phone to arrive straight out of the box with Windows Phone 8.1 .. Price-wise the Lumia 630 slots into the bottom end of the range just above the Lumia 520 and the newer Nokia Lumia 530 , but it comes jam-packed with features thanks to the upgraded operating system, therefore you get a lot of bang for your buck.. Windows Phone 8.1 offers a lot more upgrades and additions than you would expect from the usual 'point upgrade', it's almost a complete overhaul of its predecessor.. All of the desirable features of Windows Phone 8 remain, however the upgrade pushes the OS closer to its competitors iOS and Android, replicating their existing features with the likes of the new Word Flow Keyboard and Action Centre.. Other additions to the new Windows Phone system are all focused on putting the smart back into smartphone as it focuses on getting you the most out of your features.. Data Sense and Wi-Fi Sense look to take the hassle out of data usage and Wi-Fi connection. The new ClearBlack screen allows you to enjoy the new entertainment features and apps available, including Xbox games.. The Nokia Lumia 630 also has new internal hardware ready to take advantage of the SensorCore SDK announced at Build 2014 so it can essentially act as your personal pedometer and measurement tool, because who doesn't take their phone everywhere they go.. The operating system isn't the only upgrade on the Lumia 630; it also has a generous 4.5-inch ClearBlack, 480 x 854 display, 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 processor and 512MB of RAM, beating out both the Lumia 530 and 620 .. All that is not too shabby considering you can pick up the Nokia Lumia 630 for around £80 SIM-free, £59.99 locked on pay as you go, or free if you buy it on a pay monthly deal from £7.50 per month. A dual-SIM variant is also available from around £110 SIM-free.. Although it's certainly an improvement on previous low-end Lumia's, there are still some features missing that you might expect. The Nokia Lumia 630 still doesn't have NFC , a camera flash or a front-facing snapper so if those are must-haves then this isn't the phone for you.. However, if you can live without those then it's not bad for the bargain price.. Statement colour is the cornerstone of the Nokia Lumia range and the Lumia 630 is no exception. The Nokia Lumia 630 has a removable, and therefore interchangeable, case so you can switch from the outspoken and fun bright green, bright yellow and bright orange to a more understated and professional black or white case.. The removable case also allows for easier access to the battery and SIM card so you won't be scrambling for a safety pin to get to the SIM (let's face it, you'll inevitably lose the actual tool for the job).. It also makes the Lumia 630 feel lighter and less bulky and allows for a larger screen than previous designs due to a smaller bezel.. The Nokia Lumia 630 is more rectangular and less smoothly finished than most of its competitors, however it has a strong and eye-catching design that follows the line of the higher-end Nokia's like the Lumia 920 .. Its change in design makes it slimmer than the Lumia 620 , 530 and 520 at just 9.2mm. Yet the increased screen size makes it heavier at 134g and wider at 129.5 x 66.7mm. This alongside the rectangular design does mean it feels quite wide in the hand, so I wouldn't recommend it if you have small, delicate hands.. Although the shell is removable, as with other Lumias it is a strong enough case that you don't need anything in addition. You can still customise the design to an extent – case manufacturers are bound to already be beavering away on alternative designs.. The front of the Nokia Lumia 630 is mostly screen and a good sized one at that for such a low-priced design. At 271 pixels per inch it's certainly not the best quality screen you'll find out there but for the price, what more can you expect?. You can also use gloves with it, which is becoming more common but it's a great selling point, or it will be in the winter at least.. Although the screen is sizeable, it isn't edge-to-edge. There's a black border running the entire way around it. The border becomes wider at the top to allow for the Nokia logo, ear and mouth pieces and at the bottom where you'll find the start, back and search soft-keys.. The back of the Nokia Lumia 630 is very simple with just a small loudspeaker, the 5MP camera lens near the top and of course the small Nokia logo in the centre.. The right edge of the handset houses all of the phone's physical buttons, with a volume rocker and the power button just below it. The signature camera button has been removed which is a shame as it was an added bonus on previous Nokia devices.. The left edge is completely free of any features, ports or buttons at all. The top is home only to a 3.5mm headphone port on the left-hand side and the bottom edge has a micro USB port in the centre, which is used for charging or connecting the Nokia Lumia 630 to a computer.. The back cover is easy to remove – you simply use your nails to peel it away at each corner. The cover is suitably strong enough and therefore unlikely to snap even if you're changing it every five minutes.. Once that has been removed, you'll have access to the 1830mAh battery, which is bigger than the Lumia 520 and 620.. Beneath the battery there are two slots – one for a micro SIM card and one for a microSD card. The Nokia Lumia 630 supports up to 128GB cards, which is useful for extending the fairly limited 8GB of on-board memory and 7GB OneDrive cloud storage.. Next Page Key Features.

Nokia has had a lot of success making really high quality mobile phones at very inexpensive price points. This was true 20 years ago, and these days Nokia (now in the form of Microsoft’s handset division ) is trying to translate that success to the smartphone market. Of course smartphones are far more complicated than the mobile phones of the 90s and they’re more expensive to make, but as Nokia proved with the Lumia 520, it’s still possible to make something that works very well without costing $600.. The Nokia Lumia 630 is another one of those inexpensive smartphones that cuts out a lot of high-end features in order to reduce costs, but doesn’t cut out so much as to make things completely unusable. It’s mainly an upgrade to the Lumia 620 with a couple of nice improvements including a built in pedometer to help the calorie counters out there. Read on for our full thoughts on this new sub-$200 Windows Phone 8.1 smartphone.. The Lumia 630 has a quad-core 1.2Ghz Snapdragon 400 processor with 512Mb of RAM and 8 GB of internal storage. About half of that is taken up by the operating system, bundled apps, and your synced email accounts data. That’s not a lot of room for very many third party apps, music, pictures, and videos, so thankfully a Micro SD slot is under the battery cover. You can add up to 128 GB of storage that way and what’s excellent about Windows Phone 8.1 is that you can now move or install apps to the SD card.. The phone’s size is nothing particularly impressive, with a height of 129.5 mm, width of 66.7 mm, and thickness of 9.2 mm. The weight is a comfortable 134 grams. The screen size is also average at 4.5″, but the resolution is only 854 x 480 pixels with a 221ppi density. This particular model is the European single-SIM version which does not include North American LTE bands, but we hear a similar Lumia 635 will be arriving soon with better North American network support.. The Lumia 630 also includes a 5 megapixel camera on the back, but there’s no flash, nor is there a front-facing camera. It’s also missing a proximity sensor on the front which means the screen doesn’t shut off when it’s up against your head. An ambient light sensor is missing as well, which means the screen brightness won’t adjust automatically like many other smartphones these days. There’s no NFC or wireless charging either, but it does have an internal pedometer, which we’ll talk more about later. Powering it all is an 1830 mAh BL-5H battery; unlike the Lumia 520’s easy-to-find BL-5J, replacement BL-5H batteries aren’t easily sourced.. By all counts except for one, the Lumia 630 is a budget phone. There’s nothing particularly exciting about it. It’s got a good sturdy polycarbonate build that doesn’t feel particularly premium quality, but it still seems like it could handle some accidental drops without problem.. The screen is an odd 854 x 480 pixel resolution because it includes the 3 navigation buttons at the bottom which are normally implemented separately as hardware capacitive buttons on other Windows Phones. This is Gorilla glass, by the way, but the viewing angles, color production, and pixel density isn’t as good as other higher-end phones.. Note the reduction in contrast from this angle. Don’t expect to be amazed by the screen on such an inexpensive smartphone.. If you get too close to the display, pictures will look like you’re viewing them through a screen door as the pixels are quite noticeable.. On the right side there’s a power button and an up/down volume control. The buttons are easy to find with your fingers and they’ve got great tactile feedback. However, a dedicated camera button is missing, which is extremely unfortunate. To launch the camera, you’ll have to pin its tile to your start screen, or add the camera quick action to the Action Center. Unfortunately, the action center’s top-edge screen gesture is very poorly placed at the top of the screen .. On the bottom there’s the micro USB port for charging and syncing. You can also see a tiny hole on the edge where the phone’s microphone is located.. The left side has nothing but smooth plastic, but it’s important to note that these edges are very flat with a subtle angle. That’s a very good thing because too often, phone manufacturers get obsessed with making phones feel thin. When it’s too thin, it becomes difficult to hold and use.. On the top is the 3.5-millimeter headset jack.. On the back is the 5 megapixel camera. Again, there’s no flash here, so you’ll only want to use the camera outdoors with a good amount of light.. Under the battery cover is a Micro-SIM slot. Some versions of the Lumia 630 offer dual SIM card slots which allow you to have two separate mobile phone accounts on the same device.. Here’s a look at the Micro-SD slot. You have to remove the battery to access it, but being able to add up to 128 GB of extra storage for apps, music, videos, and pictures is an excellent thing to have.. Compared to the Lumia 521, the Lumia 630 is much thinner. We feel that the rounded backing of the Lumia 521 makes for a more comfortable feel in hand, though.. Still, the extra thinness compared to other low-end Windows Phones makes the Lumia 630 fit well in the pocket.. The Nokia Lumia 630 is the first smartphone to launch with Windows Phone 8.1 as well as Nokia’s “Cyan” firmware update. You can read more about the operating system in our Windows Phone 8.1 review as well as our Windows Phone 8.0 review , but there are a few new things in the version of the operating system on the Lumia 630 that we weren’t able to test in our original review.. The coolest thing about the Lumia 630 is the new pedometer hardware built in. You can turn on the “motion tracking” setting and the phone will keep track of your walking and running at all times. It currently works with the Bing Health & Fitness app (included) and you can pin a live tile to your start screen for constant updates on how many steps you’ve walked and how many calories you’ve burned. It’s much better than GPS-based exercise tracking programs since it still works indoors.. This feature should also be coming to some existing Nokia Lumia phones when they get the “Cyan” firmware update and hopefully we’ll see it in future phones as well. Currently, only the “Health & Fitness” app from Microsoft has tied into the built-in pedometer feature, but it’s likely that others such as Fitbit, Endomondo, or MyFitnessPal will add support. Another issue is that our calories-burned and steps-taken statistics don’t seem to sync with the Bing Health & Fitness apps on my other Windows Phones and Windows tablets. The Lumia 630 has an SD card slot under the battery cover, so that means we’re now able to take advantage of Windows Phone 8.1’s new features for storing content and apps on the storage card. You can even move many (but not all) of the pre-installed apps to your SD card in order to free up space in your main memory. This is extremely important since the Lumia 630 has only 8 GB of built in storage. Being able to add 128 GB means you can put far more videos, music, photos, and apps on this device than many of the other so-called “high end” Windows Phones out there. We moved a lot of apps and installed the very storage-heavy “Halo: Spartan Assault” to a 32 GB storage card and everything worked just fine. We didn’t notice any performance problems or stability issues in doing things this way, however it is possible that stability issues could occur if you load a corrupt Micro SD card into the phone.. Another small but notable change here is the screen-based back, start, and search collective. Previously these buttons were always placed below the screen as hardware capacitive or tactile keys. On the Lumia 630, they’re part of the screen and you have some options to change their colors.. You can make it so the navigation bar is the same color as your theme, always dark, or it can match the app’s background. That last option means it will be light in the email program when you’re reading a message since that turns everything white.. The phone includes Nokia’s HERE Drive+ free GPS navigation program with support for downloading free offline maps of many countries around the world. Another feature that’s probably worth the cost of the phone is the Nokia Music app. You can download up to 4 custom radio mixes for offline listening. Then when you get tired of those, you can delete them and download 4 more. It’s unlimited offline music! The catch is you can’t rewind any songs. You have to listen to the whole playlist, though you can skip about 6 per hour. Still, that’s free music with no data plan.. We’ve already mentioned the 5-megapixel camera, which is about on par with the other inexpensive Nokia cameras. Not having a flash on this phone forces you to confine your picture-taking to decent lighting conditions: stick to bright light, and you can actually snap some decent photos with this camera.. Take a look at the samples below. The first image is an example of low-light photos taken with the Lumia 630. That’s right: with no flash, no image stabilization, and very little ISO adjustment capabilities, your low-light photos will be mostly black. On the other hand, outdoor photos with plenty of light can turn out to be not bad at all. Sure there’s some noise if you look close enough, and you may see a bit of artificial sharpening, but the colors look good and we haven’t seen any major chromatic aberrations.. The Nokia Lumia 630 scored 218.14 in WPBench, compared to 169.25 on the Lumia 521, 234.73 on Lumia 928 or 232.11 for the Lumia 925. The Lumia 630 certainly performs pretty nicely in the benchmarks, but the new Windows Phone 8.1 operating system makes things feel a little slower than previous versions of Windows Phone, since version 8.1 required many apps to be rebuilt so that they could be installed and updated separately from the operating system. That means things like the Music app are much slower and even the Calendar has a splash screen that you have to look at before it gets to your information.. In WP Bench’s battery life test under constant CPU stress, the Lumia 630 lasted for about 2 hours 47 minutes. That doesn’t sound like much, but in real life with three or so push email accounts added, some average web browsing, Facebook usage, and pedometer walking, the battery lasts well through a day, maybe a day and a half.. While the Lumia 630 does have a removable battery that you can swap out for a fresh one while you’re out and about, as mentioned above, the battery type is not a particularly easy-to-find or inexpensive variety. One of the huge advantages of the Lumia 520 and 521 was that they used a Nokia BL-5J battery which is very easy to find for around $4. Replacements for the Lumia 630’s BL-5H are very rare, which kind of defeats the purpose of having a removable battery.. Voice calls sound about average on the Lumia 630. The speaker doesn’t seem to be as loud as the older Lumia 520, but it works.. The Lumia 630 doesn’t have LTE support either, so you’ll be stuck with HSPA network speeds, however the Lumia 635 variant will have LTE support when it’s released.. The Lumia 630 is a budget device, so it’s available in the nice and low $150 range. That’s not as inexpensive as the Nokia Lumia 520, though, which we’ve seen in the $45-$70 range without a contract.. While we love those new sensor core features for GPS-independent exercise tracking, the Lumia 630 is a tough sell. with so many other hardware features lacking (or simply absent). If you’re going to go with a budget Windows Phone, we’d recommend going all the way and looking for a $45-$60 Nokia Lumia 520.. Furthermore, since this phone is selling in the $150 range, if you want something better than a Lumia 520, you can find the Nokia Lumia 925 in the $200 range (with no contract) these days. That’s only a little more expensive than the Lumia 630, but it has many more high-end features like a much better screen, optical image stabilization and a flash on the camera, wireless charging capabilities, front-facing camera, LTE, etc.. have proven before, a compelling price point isn’t always enough..

Nokia Lumia 630 review: An affordable phone you can live without. Nokia Lumia 630 and 635 bring Windows Phone 8.1 to budget seekers (hands-on). AMD pops out sub-$100 quad-core Athlon II X4 CPU: review roundup. Samsung unveils latest Series 6 Touch of Color LCD HDTVs. Nokia Lumia 630 and 635 bring Windows Phone 8.1 to budget seekers (hands-on). Nokia may not be an official part of Microsoft yet -- that should finally happen later this month, if you ask either company -- but that doesn't stop the phone maker from cranking out more devices at the software giant's developer conference. This morning at Build, Stephen Elop announced three new Lumia devices, although two of them are about as close to twins as you can possibly get: the Lumia 630 , which is a 3G device that comes in single- and dual-SIM flavors, and the 635, which adds LTE. Both are sub-$200 smartphones aimed squarely at both emerging markets and anyone else who just wants a Windows Phone 8.1 device without spending a lot of money in the process.. Gallery: Nokia Lumia 630 and 635 hands-on | 24 Photos. At 4.5 inches, the pair of devices hit a sweet spot in display size, but its 854 x 480 FWVGA resolution isn't going to bedazzle. It's an inexpensive phone, however, so it's not horrible given what you're paying for. The handsets aren't necessarily designed from a premium perspective, but just like the 620 and 625 before them, these phones are colorful and offer interchangeable shells, which make them a lot more personable and customizable. In addition to the standard black and white hues, you'll be able to choose from green, orange and yellow (all bright).. When we played with the new devices, we saw two different types of covers. One of the options is matte, while the other is a two-toned option that is essentially an inverted version of the Lumia 620's cover. ( Update: the matte covers are actually available for the 630, while the two-toned covers are specifically sold on the 635; that said, you can still easily change them around.) They're easy to swap and they add an element of fun to the phones. It's 9.2mm thick and has blunt edges that slant slightly, and this actually works in the handset's favor -- sure, it's not the thinnest device on the market, but it's very comfortable and easy to hold.. Thanks to this morning's update to Windows Phone, the Lumia 630 comes with a whole bunch of firsts for a Windows Phone: the inaugural dual-SIM device, the first we've seen with virtual soft keys and the first without a physical shutter button on the right-hand side. If you're going to be using the 5MP rear camera on a regular basis, you'll at least be able to add the camera into the action center as a quick-access shortcut. You'll also be able to take advantage of Cortana, the new virtual assistant on Windows Phone 8.1, as well as the Action Center and new keyboard with swipe gestures.. Another interesting feature on the 630 and 635 is SensorCore, which involves low-power health monitoring. Essentially, SensorCore can keep an eye on how many steps you've taken, miles you've walked and calories burned, and it logs the information into the Bing Health and Fitness app. Nokia will also release the SDK so developers can take advantage of the phone's new capability.. It comes with a Snapdragon 400 chipset and a mere 512MB of RAM, which means it doesn't have that much extra horsepower. Fortunately, we were pleasantly surprised in our first impressions; when we played with the 630, it felt a lot snappier than we originally expected. Of course, we'll have to see if that translates into regular real-world use in our full review when the time comes, but at least for now we'll take this as a good sign.. When the devices come to market in May, the single-SIM 630 will be $159, while you'll be able to get the dual-SIM variant for $169 and the Lumia 635 for $189. This may not be quite as inexpensive as the tremendously successful Lumia 520, but we'd be very surprised if we don't see a Lumia 530 or similar with Windows Phone 8.1 sometime in the near future..

I write about technology's biggest companies. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. When a mobile operating system gets a major update its debut usually comes on a piece of cutting edge hardware. Manufacturers obviously want to show it off in its best light and dazzle the competition. has done the exact opposite and it may be a masterstroke.. In what is arguably Microsoft’s most important version of Windows Phone to date the company has given the go-ahead to. to make the first 8.1 handset a budget device. And this is no half measure: the Nokia 630 will go on sale for just $159 in the US, 119 euros in Europe and £89.95 in the UK all without contract. A dual sim variant will cost $169 and 129 euros (we await UK pricing).. It sends a clear message: Windows Phone 8.1 is great on this, so imagine how good it will be on everything else. And this poses a clear question: well is it any good? Let’s find out.. Design – Think iPhone 5C On A Budget. Nokia’s handset division may have just passed into Microsoft’s hands, but this is clearly still a Nokia phone. It takes the advances of the Lumia range and crosses it with a hefty dose of. The colourful back of the 630 is removable and an array of bright and cheerful colours (green, orange, yellow, white and black) are available with more set to follow. This also gives access to a removable battery, the sim and an expandable microSD slot. That’s three positives points in row.. There are clear (and understandable) trade-offs though. The removable backs are tough but they also feel cheap despite a mixture of matt and gloss textures with the gloss finish in particular a fingerprint magnet. This is a stark contrast to the premium, grippy backs of upmarket Lumias like the 1020 and 1320. The front is also an oil and fingerprint magnet with Nokia not employing the same oleophobic coating as seen on premium smartphones. In fairness no budget phones did this until the trend was recently broken by Motorola’s superb Moto E and Moto G .. I’m also not a big fan of Nokia positioning the power/lock button below the volume rocker on the right side. Placing it on the top or above the rocker makes more sense and it takes some time for muscle memory to adjust. That said it fits well in the hand and at 5 x 2.6 x 0.36 inches (129.5 x 66.7 x 9.2mm) and just 4.72oz (134g) it is slim and portable.. In short then, the Lumia 630 looks good and is well proportioned but – while sturdy - its budget roots are obvious to the touch.. Windows Phone 8.1 – The Best Version By Far. So the Lumia 630 makes a decent first impression, but for many its appeal will be as an affordable way to get your hands on Windows 8.1 and I don’t blame you. You can find a full breakdown of the new OS here , but the key features are worth sounding out.. The most high profile is ‘Cortana’, Microsoft’s answer to Siri and. Named after the AI character from the Halo franchise, it works remarkably well for a first iteration. Speech recognition is fast and accurate and there is integration with core functionality like mapping, email, calls and Bing search but it remains US-only for now.. Live tiles also get a rejig with the ‘show more tiles’ option fitting three rows of tiles where you’d normally get two. Background wallpapers can be added and while they are largely covered by the tiles, at times a subtle transparency lets them be seen and the effect is slick and classy. There is also the new ‘Action Center’ which mimics the notification bar first seen in Android, then iOS. This is a great improvement and offers customisable quick settings, though it lacks the deep level control of Android.. Other niceties include the introduction of swipe typing, which works well – if not with quite the same smart prediction as established Android apps like Swiftkey – and Quiet Hours which lets you silence the phone at specific times, such as when sleeping. Microsoft has also made its own Podcast app to mitigate the rubbish selection of podcast apps currently available on Windows Phone. It isn’t perfect, but it’s good step in the right direction.. The same can be said for Windows Phone 8.1 as a whole. It may not have the app selection of iOS or Android but it is extremely slick, looks great and now has core functionality to challenge its biggest rivals. There were obvious reasons to avoid Windows Phone in the past but, app selection aside, these are now fast disappearing.. Specifications – Superb Bang For Your Buck. But Windows Phone 8.1 isn’t the only reason to lay down your cash because Nokia has crammed the Lumia 630 with the kind of specifications we’re more used to seeing in phones twice the price.. The biggest surprise is a quadcore 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 chipset and when combined with Windows Phone 8.1’s efficient footprint the handset races along. In fact, while there is just 512MB of RAM, in day-to-day tasks it outpaces some premium Android handsets weighed down by inefficient skins (I’m looking at you Samsung Galaxy S4).. You’ll also get 8GB of native storage, a decent amount at this price point (and double the standout phone in the price bracket, the Motorola Moto E ) which can be bolstered by the aforementioned microSD card slot.. The 630 also cashes in on the growing demand for big screens being the first phone in its bracket to come with a 4.5in display. With a 854 x 480 resolution, the 630 is also a step ahead of the 640 x 480 panels found in most rivals though here the Motorola Moto E has the edge with a tasty 960 x 540 display. That said few are going to be disappointed with the screen on the 630 for the outlay. It is bright and clear with sharp colours and touch response is fast and accurate. Ultimately both Nokia and Motorola are making a mockery of their rivals at this point.. An 1830mAh battery isn’t the biggest in the world, but it is significantly bigger than you’ll find in an iPhone 5S (1570mAh) and combined with Windows Phone’s efficiency and its midrange specs suggests good things (discussed in detail later).. We’ll get onto the camera later as well, but this is the most obvious sign of Nokia having to cut a few corners. You’ll find a middling 5 megapixel rear camera with autofocus but, like the Moto E, there is no front facing camera at all so you’ll need to be good at guesstimating your selfies.. Performance – A Step Above Its Rivals. We’ve already touched on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 at the heart of the 630, but it is well worth discussing the performance of this phone in a little more detail.. What Nokia has achieved with the 630 is a handset which can not only fly through day to day tasks like web browsing and email, but one that is actually powerful enough to play a number of graphically intensive games. The most notable example is Brotherhood of Violence, which runs smoothly and with virtually no slowdown.. This is unsurprising given the Snapdragon 400 is also what powers the Moto G, Motorola’s step up from the Moto E and it is a testament to Nokia that it has fit the 400 into a phone priced so low.. Camera – Good, For The Price. When I reviewed the Motorola Moto E my biggest complaint was the camera. Of course having complaints with the camera on a $130 smartphone seems churlish, but the Nokia Lumia 630 shows what you can get for slightly more.. Like the Moto E, the 630 has a relatively lowly 5 megapixel lens but crucially it has autofocus which means pictures suffer from far less blur and this makes it a much more flexible camera to use. The result is in good conditions the 630 turns out perfectly decent shots – good enough that you’d be happy to post them to Facebook, Twitter or (just about) Instagram. But view shots at 100% (as in the cropped samples here) and you’ll notice the lack of detail.. The 630 also struggles when lighting conditions become more complicated, such as this shot with the jogger. The brightest parts of the shot are blown out while the detail from darker areas is lost.. It is a similar story with video. The 630 again steps above the Moto E with 720p HD shooting (versus standard definition 480p) and while results are again good enough for social media, it isn’t want you’d want to use to capture important events.. Regardless the Lumia 630 sets a new bar for ultra-cheap smartphones and that is to be applauded.. Battery – All Day Then Some. The specifications sheet suggests good things when it comes to battery life and the 630 delivers. Unlike many premium, power-packed smartphones this budget phone can comfortably last a full day (9am to midnight, not 9am to 6pm) with moderate use, while light use will get over 1.5 days.. Funnily enough the lower specs in most budget phones tends to mean many outperform the flagships in their range, but again the 630 stands tall and we can only imagine the heaviest of users getting a low battery alert before bedtime.. Before we wrap up there are a couple of 630 aspects which also deserve your attention. The first is Nokia’s software additions to Windows Phone. Since its partnership with Microsoft, the company has been a model in how to add value to a platform without choking it (again, take note Samsung) and here the 630 is no exception.. Foremost in our thoughts are the excellent Here Maps, Transit and Drive navigation which give Google Maps a run for their money (and run circles around the still lacking Apple Maps). Nokia MixRadio is also a tasteful Last.fm alternative, while its photo (Creative Studio and Refocus) and video (Video Trimmer) apps are improvements on the native editing software.. Lastly Nokia has fitted the 630 with a decent external speaker. This is a much undervalued part of many phones and while it lacks bass (all speakers do barring HTC’s One range) it is loud and clear making speakerphone calls and podcasts on that shiny new Microsoft app a pleasure.. The first point to get out the way is the most obvious: this is by far the best budget Windows Phone handset to date. Windows Phone 8.1 is a massive improvement on its own, but Nokia also does a lot of the heavy lifting with an array of midrange components at budget prices. The bigger question is whether the 630 is good enough to upset the lorry load of budget Android handsets on the market and by and large the answer is yes. Motorola’s Moto E ($129.99) and Moto G ($179.99) are currently head and shoulders above the Android competition and at $159.99 ($169.99 for dual sim) the Lumia 630 matches the specs of the Moto G while undercutting it. There is an even better deal in the UK where the 630 matches the price of the Moto E (£89.95).. While it won’t be long before Microsoft removes the Nokia name from its newly acquired handset division, the Lumia 630 shows what a talented unit it has acquired. Nokia has made a handset which outperforms any in its price bracket and it is a wonderful advocate for the launch of Windows Phone 8.1. Its obvious competition are the Motorola Moto E and Moto G and the 630 successfully trades blows with both. As such the biggest question for many will be whether they are willing to give Windows Phone a chance. That’s a personal decision, but with the Lumia 630 there has never been a better time to try something new..

The Nokia we used to know is no longer. In late April, the handset maker was finally folded into Microsoft's Devices and Services business after more than six months of courtship. Nokia wasn't ready to be assimilated without once last hurrah, however: It announced a trio of new devices at its new owner's developer conference, Build. The Finnish company had always tried to cater to every demographic, so it was fitting that its last in-house handsets were the top-end Lumia 930 (a global version of the Icon ) and the entry-level Lumia 630/635 .. The 630 and 635, 3G and 4G variants of the same device, are joining an already-crowded lineup of affordable Lumias. They're distinguished somewhat by launching with Windows Phone 8.1 , the latest version of Microsoft's mobile OS, but in the coming months, other WP8 handsets will catch up. That's if curiosity hasn't already driven you to update manually using the developer-account loophole. The 635 is yet to be released, but for now we have the almost identical Lumia 630. Other than offering the newest software, then, is the 630 Nokia's best budget device? A worthy sendoff for the company? A save-the-best-'til-last-type deal? Spoiler's in the headline.. Gallery: Lumia 630 review | 25 Photos. The Lumia 635 is a much-needed addition to Nokia's affordable handset range. It has a serviceable camera, fun design and good battery life, but most importantly, it's one of the best-value LTE devices out there.. Plenty of good alternatives in this price range. The Nokia Lumia 630 is another affordable Windows Phone that’s nice to look at. It also has a good camera and exceptional battery life, but is missing a few basic features like a front-facing camera. With several good alternatives in the same price range, you can take it or leave it.. You'd be forgiven for confusing the Lumia 630 with the iPhone 5c. They're similar in size and shape, although it might seem a crooked comparison considering Nokia's been doing colorful plastic for much longer than Apple. Up close, the 630 is more like a mash-up of the 620 and 520 that came before it. Slightly larger than both, it combines the rounded corners of the 620 with the more sharply tapered back panel of the 520. It's blockier than both, however, with the flat edges meeting a flat back.. Nokia really hit a sweet spot with the size and weight here: 129.5 x 66.7 x 9.2mm and 134g. Those are agreeable numbers for anyone, and with sides that angle inward from the display, it rests nicely in the hand. None of the sharp edges dig in where they shouldn't. The build quality might not look like much given the majority of the handset is covered in plastic, with a sheet of glass covering the face as the only other material. It creaks under pressure, but given its weight and the thickness of polycarbonate that fits snugly to its back, it doesn't feel like a toy even if it looks a little like one.. The device itself is pretty plain apart from the colorful mass of plastic, though for the moment, you only have the choice of green, orange or black. You'll eventually be able to buy additional shells, and when the Lumia 635 launches, the dual-color covers we first saw on the 620 will be making an appearance. Since the 635 is identical in design, you'll be able to commandeer those for the 630, too. The back of the device is home to a small Nokia logo, rear camera lens up top and tiny loudspeaker grille in the bottom right-hand corner. On the top and bottom edges are the headphone jack and micro-USB charging/data transfer port, respectively, and the right edge carries the volume rocker and power button. There's no dedicated camera shutter key on this device; Microsoft removed that requirement in 8.1.. Another major difference from other Windows Phones can be found on the face of the device. WP 8.1 no longer demands capacitive keys on the bezel, and the Lumia 630 is the first handset to scrap these in favor of on-screen navigation buttons. Indeed, it looks plain, with the earpiece and Nokia logo up top, display in the center and a small hole for the mic on the bottom edge. The effect is a design that's slightly unique and a little less cluttered.. Like other budget Lumias, the 630 doesn't have a whole lot of pixels to play with. Its 4.5-inch display sports the rare FWVGA resolution (854 x 480), which is essentially 800 x 480 with a little extra length to accommodate the on-screen navigation keys. I've never cared too much about pixel density on affordable handsets (if your'e curious, the 630 works out to 221 ppi). The Lumia 625 pushed even my tolerance boundaries, but even then, I'm more interested in the quality of the panel than the quantity of pixels. Alas, the 630 has little to offer in either respect.. Nokia incorporated its ClearBlack technology into the LCD display; not that the term really means anything here. In fact, the display has a lovely color temperature, with excellent whites, but it's let down by the black range. They're almost fake, like smothering a lamp with black fabric and calling it darkness. Along the same lines (but not as noticeable), the display on my device is unevenly lit along the top edge, with alternating patches of light and dark as if a row of tiny spotlights was hidden under the bezel.. Update: After posting this review, Microsoft/Nokia insisted I'd been given a non-final device (see the performance section for another update), and the second handset I received had an improved display. While the quality of the panel was the same, the installation was significantly better, all but nullifying the gripe I had with uneven lighting on the top edge of the display.. Despite its failings, the display is guarded well by a sheet of Corning's Gorilla Glass 3. Unfortunately, Nokia seemed unable to afford the final coat, as it's very sticky and a serves as a magnet for all the oil and grime you wouldn't believe came from your fingertips. Aside from the Xperia SP , it's the worst I've seen on this front. Whatever's not quite right with the glass, it has additional side effects, including hampering sunlight readability. Assuming you can actually see through the layer of skin on top of the glass, there's a nice helping of glare that'll have you squinting at the display on a bright day. Its reflectiveness significantly reduces viewing angles, too.. Luckily, the panel can kick out a lot of light, meaning the 630 isn't completely useless when the sun's about. Strangely, there's no auto-brightness setting, so it's good that Windows Phone 8.1's new "Action Center" offers a quick way to make changes. Despite these issues, the display still works. That said, the 630 is definitely not for videophiles. The Lumia 620 came out well over a year ago, so the fact that the 630 has a worse panel is disappointing.. Update: The issues I had with the glass were mostly resolved on the second handset.. The Lumia 630, 635 and 930 are the official Windows Phone 8.1 launch devices, not that it's hard to install the developer preview of the new OS on older models. Several of the most important changes in the latest version have little to do with the immediate user experience (think: wider support for different hardware configurations). In the same vein, Microsoft's also relaxed its handset design requirements. Capacitive navigation keys and a dedicated camera button are no longer mandatory, for example, and indeed, the 630 has neither.. There are plenty of pre-installed apps on the Lumia 630, but PayPal, Skype and Line are the only ones you'd call bloatware. In addition to these, you'll find a slew of apps that aggregate news, track stocks, check the weather, recommend places to eat and drink, keep you up to date on the world of sports and so on. Luckily, all nonessential apps can be uninstalled if you want to trim the fat. Nokia and Microsoft have cooked in some of their own software, of course, like the global satnav app Here Drive+, and productivity tools like Office, OneDrive and OneNote.. I've always been a fan of Windows Phone's Live Tile UI, in terms of both looks and functionality. In the latest OS release, you can now set a background image for this home screen, which is essentially invisible. Tiles for many of the stock apps, however, act as a transparent window, which is a nice visual touch that also allows for deeper personalization. Additionally, you can add another column of Live Tiles to the home screen by shrinking their footprint, but I found that bigger was better on the 630's 4.5-inch display. The keyboard now supports swipe-based typing, and apps can be installed to SD cards for the first time -- an important change for handsets without much internal storage. WP 8.1 also grants users better access to their storage with a new file manager available on the app store.. The big changes in Windows Phone 8.1 are the addition of a notification drawer and the virtual assistant, Cortana. Through the Action Center, as it's called, you view notifications and access them within their respective apps, as you'd expect. There are also four slots to customize with quick access to settings (WiFi, etc.) and apps, like the camera. It's certainly a welcome addition to Windows Phone, but it still feels like a poor imitation of the same feature on Android. Cortana isn't supposed to be available in the UK until later this year, but you can access it by changing your region and language settings to trick the phone into thinking it's American. Once Cortana was up and running, I spent a few minutes asking it silly questions and a few more testing the limits of its contextual responses. Since then, I've been using it just as much as I do any other voice-controlled assistant: Never.. Overall, I'm underwhelmed by Windows Phone 8.1. If anything, the new version highlights how behind other mobile platforms it still is. Some really simple things still don't work the way they should. The screen-timeout setting, for example, will ignore most apps, leading to frustrating situations where the phone locks up and kills the current process because you weren't paying attention for 30 seconds. Also, the automatic time setting is as broken as it's ever been, so you'll have to set it manually (and again every time you run out of battery). Seeing as email syncing is linked with the internal clock, you'll stop receiving new messages if the time is set incorrectly. Even when it comes to the bigger new features, Cortana and a notification center do not a good OS make.. There's not much to say about the front-facing camera on the Lumia 630 because, as with the 520, there isn't one. The only camera is a modest five megapixels with no companion flash. Thankfully, Nokia knows a thing or two about imaging, and the 630's camera is one of its redeeming features. You have two options when it comes to stock camera apps, and not much separates them. Microsoft's offering loads up instantly, with normal camera, video and a low-resolution burst-capture mode to choose from. You can also select different Lenses straight from the viewfinder, but all the finer settings like white balance and exposure compensation are buried in the full menu.. In contrast, these settings are accessible from the viewfinder in Nokia's camera app, albeit using a small, fiddly toolbar. Lenses, on the other hand, are found in the deeper menu, and Nokia's app takes a few seconds to boot up, so not the best choice for opportunistic shots. The burst-capture mode of Microsoft's app is replaced by "Smart Sequence," which is more or less the same thing, but with the option to select your favorite shots after the fact..

Performance and battery life Update: After posting this review, Microsoft/Nokia insisted I'd been given a non-final device, as evidenced by severe battery life issues I experienced. Testing a second handset has confirmed as much, and the 630 actually has above average battery life. Even with relatively frequent use, including browsing, taking pictures, sending email and streaming music, it's been good for a full day and half of the next. Using the battery saver feature only added to the longevity. I've also noticed the screen is slightly improved on the second unit, which you can read more about in the display section. The 4G Lumia 635 The competition Wrap-up. On full auto, the 5MP camera does its best work in sunny conditions. Color temperature is spot-on and the focal range is broad. I've also nothing to complain about when it comes to focus and shutter speeds, although manually tapping to focus on different areas of the viewfinder was sometimes required to get the correct exposure. As lighting conditions worsened, I was impressed by how the camera held up. I did notice that pictures tended to adopt the hue of artificial lighting, so the auto-white balance setting isn't as good as it could be. I'd say better an image look the same as it does through the human eye, however, than one that's been crudely adjusted. Low-light performance is better than I expected, too, with snaps coming out considerably lighter than you'd think they would.. Video performance at 720p is much the same, although audio quality isn't a highlight. The camera is my favorite thing about the Lumia 630, mainly because it's above acceptable considering the price point. I'm only talking about the normal camera modes, as well, so there's even more fun to be had with Nokia's extra Lenses, such as Cinemagraph, Blink and Refocus.. Like earlier, lower-end Lumias, the 630's spec sheet is no trump card, but at least it's working with the current generation of Qualcomm chips. That would be a 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 400, to be exact, paired with a miserly 512MB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. Finding enough space for all your apps and media is no trouble, as the handset's microSD slot supports cards of up to 128GB -- and remember that WP 8.1 now allows apps to be installed onto expandable storage. That Snapdragon 400 SoC is by far the stand-out spec from that selection, and I've seen it ace performance tests on several Android smartphones of late, such as the Moto G and UK-only EE Kestrel .. I find myself questioning its place inside the Lumia 630, though. One of the pros of Windows Phone as a platform is that it's not resource hungry, which has meant Nokia could produce phones like the Lumia 520 and 620 at such compelling price points without sacrificing much in the way of user experience. The Lumia 630, as you'd imagine, feels just as slick as either of those handsets do. Popping in and out of menus or core apps happens as fast as you'd ever need it to, but it's the lack of improvement in performance that stands out.. The difference in app-loading speeds on the 630, compared with older Lumias, is negligible. Only when you put them side by side to test the disparity will you notice the 630 is a millisecond quicker. Asphalt 8: Airborne is one of the most graphically intensive mobile games on any platform, but the problem is that it's scaled to be friendly to all Windows Phone hardware. On Android handsets with a quad-core Snapdragon 400, you can see how capable the chipset is by pumping up the graphics settings to max. You can't change such settings on the Windows Phone version, but even at a low visual standard, I experienced dropped frames and jittery music. I can't remember the last time I noticed a phone's temperature rising, other than when using the 630. Anything you would consider hardware-intensive, from gaming to streaming video, quickly drove the thermostat up to alarming levels.. Having been impressed with the same SoC on Android devices, I imagine it's a case of poor optimization. While the processor upgrade doesn't seem to have made much of an impact on performance, it's a burden on the 630's 1,830mAh battery. With fairly moderate use, I could barely get through half a day on a charge. If you want to do something a little more processor-intensive than checking your emails, be prepared to watch the charge melt away before your eyes. When I wasn't out or using the handset, it was permanently on charge. Annoyingly, the battery indicator is misleading, too -- the icon will have you believe you have around three quarters left, but if you look in the notification tray, you'll find it hovering just above 50 percent.. Internet Explorer is your window to the web, and it's not the fastest mobile browser. Regardless of your connection, sites can take a good few seconds to pull up (they load completely, rather than piecemeal). After they've loaded, the only other curiosity is some tiling, which can be caused by rapidly zooming in and out. For connections, you've got WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS and HSDPA 3G (21.1 Mbps max download speeds). WiFi connects quickly, but doesn't hold a consistently strong pairing, at least according to the signal icon. The speed and accuracy of GPS location is superb, and a nice companion to Windows Phone's excellent mapping options.. Audio quality is also worth a mention. Through headphones, the range is better than quite a few smartphones, but that's let down by kind of a vapid, clinical tone to the sound. Under the polycarbonate shell of the 630 sits an abnormally large loudspeaker that pumps through an abnormally small grille. Realistically, this is for making hands-free calls, not getting the party started. It's just strange that audio quality through this speaker is actually better with the case off. Reverberations inside the cover give a greater sense of bass, but really it's just distortion from the grille bottleneck.. The Lumia 635 is almost identical to the 630, but with the key addition on an LTE radio. While the 630 didn't rise above what Nokia had already achieved with previous budget handsets, the 635 is a much more welcome addition to the range. The only other affordable, 4G device Nokia has to offer is the Lumia 625 , launched last year. The handset had a number of flaws -- particularly its large, low-resolution display -- and only just crept into an acceptable price range. It was a missed opportunity after the highly regarded 620 had earned Nokia some cred, and the better-executed Lumia 635 is a great example of what the 625 should have been.. The Lumia 635 hardware differs from that of the 630 in a couple of ways. There's the LTE radio, of course, which has minimal impact on overall battery life compared to its 3G counterpart. With moderate to frequent use, the 635 runs out of gas a few hours earlier than the 630 does under the same conditions, but by this point you're well into day two anyway, so we're dealing with a relatively negligible margin. Otherwise, it's just the style of the polycarbonate back covers that distinguishes the two variants. The 630's have a matte effect, while the 635's have the glossier "dual-shot" style of shell we first saw on the 620, where transparent plastic is layered over a colored base to give the shell a visual depth. These give the phone a lot more character, though all matte and glossy covers can be used on both the 630 and 635, leaving plenty of options in hue and texture.. With LTE, the 635 is a much more attractive handset for US carriers to range than the 3G 630. Availability is still limited, but you can buy a 635 locked to AT&T for only $100 (off-contract), which appears to be by far the best value 4G handset it offers. It's the same story at T-Mobile, even though a device locked to that network is almost a third more expensive at $129 (from Microsoft's store; it's $168 direct from T-Mobile). I'd usually refer to the benchmark of affordable 4G phones at this point, the Moto G LTE, but it's in a different league at $219 ( unlocked from Motorola ; no carrier deals exist currently).. The situation is slightly different in the UK, mind you, where competition is fiercer. Both the Moto G LTE and Lumia 635 can be had for free across various carriers on the most basic 4G contacts. Unlocked, the cost of the Moto hovers just over £150, making the Lumia only slightly cheaper at £137. Pay-as-you-go price, however, favors the 635 more heavily and Phones 4u is currently asking for £110 and your choice of any network (note only Carphone Warehouse comes close to that at £130 ). The Moto G LTE, on the other hand, will set you back £150 (just shy of the unlocked price ) unless you take Tesco Mobile's offer of £135 .. The final call on which affordable phone is the best is really down to budget and preference. If you dig Windows Phone, especially after the recent 8.1 upgrade, then the 635 is a bargain at £110 on pay-as-you-go. The EE Kestrel is even more of a steal at £99 if Android's more your thing, though that does limit your carrier choice somewhat. Those happy to open their pockets a little wider might want to opt for the Moto G LTE instead, something I'd recommend for the higher-resolution display and better camera alone. The important thing is there's no wrong answer, and Nokia and Microsoft finally have the solid, low-cost 4G option the 625 struggled to be.. Normally this section would be about comparing the smartphone to what else is out there. This time, though, it's an exercise in proving why there is no need for the Lumia 630. We know the 630 and 635 are expected to cost under $200 in the US, with the single-SIM 630 said to be $159, assuming it'll even launch there -- the 635 will definitely have some presence on T-Mobile , possibly in July if everything plays out as planned.. I'm not sure where the price of the 630 was lost in translation, but Nokia's UK press release that pre-empted the device's launch said it would be available for £90 unlocked. In reality, the cheapest you can get it for is £99 on a locked, pay-as-you-go basis. SIM-free, that rises to £109 from one retailer, and Microsoft's even selling the handset through its online store for an insulting £129. Last year's Lumia 620 may have a lesser processor, but it's a better phone in every other respect. Also, given its age, it's comparable on price at £100 on pay-as-you-go or £110 unlocked. Even the Lumia 520 is a better option at £60 on pay-as-you-go or £85 unlocked.. If you're dead-set on Windows Phone, the Lumia 630 is not the right decision. That's if you would even consider any of the handsets I've mentioned over affordable Android offerings from the likes of Motorola. The amazing Moto G is £110 on pay-as-you-go or £130 unlocked, whereas the Moto E is even cheaper at £79 on pay-as-you-go or £89 unlocked. Better handsets, better mobile platform -- better forget about the Lumia 630.. The Lumia 635 will be more relevant when it launches, thanks to that LTE radio, and the only other affordable Lumia with 4G is the depressing 625. I dread to think what a 4G radio will do to the already-poor battery life, and the 635 will still have to face off against the LTE version of the Moto G (not yet released). Unless Microsoft intends to give the 635 away for free, I don't see my opinion being any different with the addition of LTE.. I can't help but feel that the Lumia 630 was thrown together to be a Windows Phone 8.1 demo device, and then someone decided it was suitable for a retail release. Forget that Microsoft still has come catching up to do before its mobile OS is considered on par with others; the hardware itself is lacking. The display is poor, and even the glass covering it is missing whatever coating most other handsets have to repel fingertip grime. There's no noticeable performance improvement over previous budget Lumia devices despite a newer, more capable chipset, and battery life is nothing short of atrocious. It's even missing basics like a front-facing camera or HSPA+ 3G radio.. To its credit, the 5-megapixel camera is better than you might suspect, and it has the Lumia line's signature fun, colorful stylings. If the handset cost less, I'd probably feel differently about its shortcomings, but the truth is there are better and comparable phones available for less. I have no choice but to issue a stern warning to avoid it, as there are several attractive and more affordable alternatives.. Update: After spending time with a second review unit, my opinion of the Lumia 630 has improved. Battery life is actually one of the handset's strong points, and the display installation is much tighter on the second review unit. Combined with a respectable 5-megapixel camera, it's not a bad package. That said, the 630 is still missing basic components like a front-facing camera and HSPA+ 3G radio, and there are plenty of good alternatives at lower or comparable prices..

The easiest way to explain this device would be, A great mid-low range smartphone with excellent battery backup and good display quality. The 3rd generation gorilla glass will make sure extra protection of the glass and Nokia's clearback technology will provide fresh, clear viewing experience. The overall phone experience is fast because of its 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7 quad-core processor.. If we talk about disadvantages, there are few important ones. First of all, there is no secondary camera which comes as a surprise as this will not allow you to make any kind of video calling. Another would be its 512 GB RAM. If you are a Gamer, this may not be the right choice for you. So, it can be said that, this is a great device for everyday calling, sending SMS, taking some reasonably good quality pictures, average smooth performance and viewing experience..

I have placed order for Nokia lumia 630 dual sim on 1st Jul.2014. But, I received defective product(Can't hear other person voice - Ear piece is not working) from the seller (Electronic Hub) through Flipkart. I confirmed this defective from the nearest NOKIA care center in my location(Chennai). I requested replacement for the defective phone. But, Seller(Electronic Hub) has disapproved my return request. There is no refund or replacement from their side.(They didn't say the reason for the disapproval). I don't know why Flipkart still having this seller(Electronic Hub). I'm very disappointed with the service of Flipkart and the seller(Electronic Hub). Hereafter, I will never buy any products from Flipkart.
