At the autumn conference on September 11, Xiaomi. released the latest flagship Mix 2, a full screen mobile phone evolved to version 2.0. Also released with this phone are Xiaomi Mi Note 3, but with the previous two generations of Note series, The Mi Note 3 came a 180-degree shift. It is the first Mi Note series that does not use the current flagship processor (Not SD 835).. As a former flagship, as the same stage with Xiaomi MIX 2 appearance, Xiaomi Note 3 seems a bit embarrassed. But in fact Mi Note 3 itself is not coincidental nor related with Mix 2, it focuses zoom dual camera, front beauty self portrait, beautiful four surface body, and is the first mobile phone to support face unlock. From Xiaomi Note 3, we can see that Xaiomi has made some adjustments in the strategic direction.. Since the new retail strategy, Xiaomi has launched two new retail plans in more than a month: the Xiaomi 5X and the Redmi Note 5A. This time release of the Xiaomi Note 3 really let Xiaomi have a suitable product with OPPO and vivo confrontation. Although not as dazzling like Xiaomi MIX 2 , Mi Note 3 is equally significant for Xiaomi.. Put aside the above mentioned, return to the product. This review, we mainly take a look at how about the Xiaomi Note 3 in performance of the camera?. Either of the 2 nano SIM cards can be set as main card. Xiaomi Note 3 uses a 5.5-inch 1080P screen, equipped with a Snapdragon 660 processor, 6GB of large memory, optional 64GB / 128GB storage, battery capacity of 3400mAh, with 12MP dual camera and 16MP front camera. Overall, the price of 2,499 yuan ($339.99 at GearBest), the Xiaomi Note 3 can be very balanced, it is no longer the kind of performance of the previous monster, but more like a more understanding of consumer demand for popular products.. As mentioned earlier, the Xiaomi Note 3 is the first Note series cellphone that is not equipped with the current flagship processor. This has attracted a lot of meager comments, especially for those who have been following Xiaomi for a long time. Now let’s briefly talk about the Snapdragon 660 and give the Xiaomi Note 3 a simple performance test to see exactly what it’s actually doing.. Snapdragon 660 is the star product of Qualcomm midrange processor, using 14nm process and Kryo 260 architecture, integrated Adreno 512 and Snapdragon X12 LTE modem, the Snapdragon 600 series SoC for the first time supports 600Mbps peak downlink data rate, Supports HVX based on the entire DSP processing, as well as the Snapdragon neural processing engine SDK, which are the only technology used before the Snapdragon 820/821 top chip.. Benefit from the latest technology and architecture, Snapdragon 660’s performance was over off Snapdragon 652/653, but the basic heat and power consumption and Snapdragon 625/626 flat, which is also the performance of the most recent Qualcomm energy than the most prominent processor. For the terminal, the performance can be used, but also have the power saving advantage.. Xiaimi Note 3 test scores in the Antutu is 108160 , can be used as a reference, Kirin 960, Snapdragon 821 score at 128000 points or so. In other words, the performance of Snapdragon 660 enough generation of flagship. It’s good enough for most people, whether it is for everyday use or for gaming.. Xiaomi Note 3 can be seen as a larger version of Xiaomi Mi 6 , using four curved glass body. But the difference is that Mi Note 3’s frame changed to 7 Series aluminum alloy material.. On the front of the phone, Xiaomi Note 3 uses a 5.5-inch screen, with 2.5D glass , narrow bezel, which are the current mainstream design. But still it will feel a little amazing, it is the body color. Bright blue version of the front panel is also blue, quite personal, highlights a certain difference.. The bottom of the front uses a non-porous fingerprinting solution from HuiDing Tech Company. Non-porous fingerprinting scheme first appeared in the Xiaomi 5S , but because of the immature ultrasonic fingerprint identification scheme, there is a defect in the recognition speed. Xiaomi Note 3 uses a more sophisticated capacitive fingerprinting scheme that excels at speed and accuracy.. Back of the phone, this is Xiaomi Note 3 most stunning part. Four full-scale design of the body back mellow, and when the grip can fit the palm curve as far as possible. In short, it is “look good, hold comfortable.”. Although it is a larger version of Xiaomi mi 6, but in appearance, Xiaomi Note 3 is not just magnified so simple. Its fuselage frame for the 7 series aluminum alloy, easier to mass production, lighter. This is particularly important for 5.5-inch large-screen phones. Like Mi 6, Mi Note 3 canceled the 3.5mm headphone jack. its thickness of 7.6mm, 5.5 inches in the phone also appears extremely thin.. Although not equipped with the flagship Snapdragon 835 processor, but in the pictures, Xiaomi Note 3 configuration called the top. It uses 12 million pixel dual camera, respectively, the equivalent focal length 27mm wide-angle lens and focal length 52mm telephoto lens. Wide-angle lens f / 1.8 aperture. Telephoto lens f / 2.6 aperture.. Function, it offers a portrait mode, 2x optical zoom, four-axis optical image stabilization, PDAF phase focus, dark enhancement, HDR, Panorama mode, continuous shooting mode, facial recognition. From the parameter side, Xiaomi Note 3’s main camera almost no short board. Beautiful parameters can shoot a beautiful photo, we take a real proof of proof to take a look.. Xiaomi Note 3 Portrait mode shooting distance is recommended within 2 meters. We can see that the effect of bokeh is very obvious, so that the main shooting outstanding. Moreover, the actual situation of the actual situation, observe the details of hair and other characters, there is no obvious traces of smear. Screen brightness, color exposure control accuracy. Unlike the normal mode, portrait mode photos need to be processed by the algorithm, press the shutter button to take a short time to wait for image generation. Xiaomi Note 3 processing speed is satisfactory, there will be no procrastination feeling.. Of course, the portrait mode is not only suitable for shooting people. Natural bokeh effect can make the picture in a more general sense of hierarchy.. Xiaomi Note 3’s vice camera is a 12-megapixel telephoto lens that supports 2x optical zoom. Keep the pixels in a farther position with no loss of pixels, leaving more detail.. However, it should be pointed out that although the primary and secondary cameras have the same number of pixels, they are not exactly the same. The main camera aperture f / 1.8, equipped with a 4-axis optical image stabilization, while the sub-camera aperture f / 2.6. The picture taken in 2x optical zoom mode is done with a sub-camera. Although the number of pixels per unit area required for shooting is higher, the detail is sharper. But the picture quality is inferior to the main camera, reflected in the brightness, color and picture level and many other aspects. Therefore, 2X optical zoom can only be used as part of the extreme scene mode, the necessary addition.. The Xiaomi Note 3’s main camera has reached f / 1.8 aperture, has been able to ensure sufficient amount of light, dual-camera combination to make the amount of light into the more adequate. Larger amount of light in the screen to ensure the brightness of the case, reduce the ISO, so the picture is more pure, better picture quality. And to provide greater space for future algorithms to optimize.. Turn on the flash – Mi Note 3. Turn on the flash – OnePlus 5. Xiaomi Note 3 dark environment sample picture pure, high brightness. And well preserved the details of the screen, light and dark transitions naturally, the picture is extremely rich, there is a strong sense of three-dimensional.. Xiaomi Note 3 front camera for the 16 million pixels, providing beauty 4.0, countdown Selfie, mirror, photo and many other features. The following is a self portrait.. Xiaomi Note 3 beauty Selfie effect real, natural, there is no sign of excessive smearing and retouching. This is because it is equipped with the latest AI beauty algorithm will be smart partition skin, for different facial areas using different skin beauty strategy. And it will also self-timer object based on the color correction and brightening, eye, lip color, etc. This is the first mobile phone to support face unlocking of Xiaomi. When the screen is locked, the screen lights up and the screen looks like a selfie. The phone recognizes the facial features of the user and matches the facial data that has been entered. “The way you look at the phone unlocks it” is cool and easy. Its strength is that it is also handy to unlock your cellphone when wearing gloves or wet hands in winter.. However, it also has inconvenient places. In low light conditions, can not be accurately identified, like the same fingerprint can not be on standby for your service.. After a simple experience, the facial information entry and identification process is fast. “Take a look at the phone to unlock” approach, but also very convenient. And we also tried to fool Xiaomi Note 3 face recognition with photos, many attempts failed, security is also guaranteed.. Elsewhere, Xiaomi Note 3 runs the latest MIUI 9 system. MIUI 9 focused on the system’s underlying code has made major optimization adjustments, a substantial increase in fluency, stability and power consumption performance. The newly joined the portal, information assistant, quickly find the three photos of the photo also truly achieve a one-step direct access to use more intimate.. Xiaomi Note 3 is a heavyweight product under the new strategy for offline market placement. Although it does not have the same flagship processor as the previous Xiaomi Note series phones in terms of hardware performance, the overall hardware performance of the Xiaomi Note 3 is quite adequate for most users with its Snapdragon 660 platform. Whether it is used daily or game scenarios, can ensure a smooth enough experience.. Moreover, in its main focus of the dual camera shoot, beauty Selfie, the actual performance of the Xiaomi Note 3 is really remarkable. Portrait mode bokeh is obvious, natural. 2x optical zoom can also be used to deal with some extreme shooting scenes. The overall imaging quality is completely flagship level..

At first intimidated by the processor downgrade, I could hardly imagine that the Mi Note 3 can compete with the high-end squad. But after 2 weeks with the piece of jewelry it looks a bit different. The Xiaomi Mi Note 3 is just as well made as the little brother. However, it is easier and I really liked that in practice. The sufficiently large 5.5 inch display also convinces in all respects. When it comes to performance, you do not have to do without anything in practice. The Mi Note 3 is slower than the SD821 or SD835 smartphones out there, but in practice this does not really bother us, as the Mi Note 3 is still an arrow-fast device.. Xiaomi Mi Band 3, the ultra-cheap smartband could arrive very soon. Xiaomi introduces Mi TV 4 on Valentine’s Day in India. The top 5 of Xiaomi headphones for your smartphone!.

Harga Xiaomi Mi Note 2 dan Spesifikasi Â. â Xiaomi diketahui sebagai vendor smartphone yang cukup mendominasi pasar di sejumlah wilayah. Salah satu produk andalannya adalah Xiaomi Mi Note 2 yang memiliki sambutan baik di masyarakat. Dilihat dari namanya bisa diketahui kalau smartphone ini merupakan generasi penerus dari Xiaomi Mi Note yang telah diluncurkan pada bulan Januari 2015 yang lalu. Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini nampaknya akan dibekali dengan spesifikasi yang mumpuni mengingat seri Mi Note milik pabrikan Tiongkok ini memang dikenal selalu dibekali spesifikasi yang terdepan. Meski mengusung spesifikasi yang lebih berkualitas dari pendahulunya, namun Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini bisa dipastikan memiliki tampilan yang tidak jauh beda dengan generasi sebelumnya. Selain itu, smartphone ini juga identik dengan tubuhnya yang bongsor sehingga menjadikan Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini salah satu phablet berkualitas yang ada di pasaran saat ini.. Layaknya perangkat generasi penerus, produk baru yang dihadirkan tentu akan mengusung spesifikasi yang jauh lebih baik. Hal ini jugalah yang sepertinya terjadi pada Xiaomi Mi Note 2. Meski jika dilihat fisiknya, ponsel ini sangat mirip dengan Xiaomi Mi Note, namun kualitas visual yang ditawarkannya cukup berbeda. Hal ini karena suksesornya telah membawa panel AMOLED capacitive touchscreen seluas 5.7 inci yang memiliki resolusi Full HD. Bahkan bagian visual Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini pun sudah dimaksimalkan dengan proteksi layar. Sementara pada sektor dapur pacunya, Samsung menyematkan chipset Snapdragon 821 yang mampu menghasilkan prosesor Quad-core berkecepatan 2.35 GHz. Performanya yang dihasilkannya juga makin apik dengan dua varian RAM berkapasitas 4 GB dan 6 GB yang menghiasi sektor dapur pacunya. Selain itu, Xiaomi Mi Note 2 juga menyuguhkan piranti kamera berspesifikasi tinggi pada lini fotografinya yaitu duet 22.5 MP dan 8 MP yang siap memanjakan para penyuka fotografi. Apalagi ya kecanggihan yang dibawa oleh phablet ini? Untuk mengetahui selengkapnya, yuk langsung simak ulasan spesifikasi dan harga Xiaomi Mi Note 2 dari Begawei berikut ini!. Phablet 5,7 Inci dengan Desain Identik Xiaomi Mi Note. Jika melihat sekilas dari tampilan fisiknya, spesifikasi Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini memang terlihat sangat mirip dengan kakaknya. Pilihan warna yang membalut bodinya pun cukup menarik karena tersedia dalam warna hitam, emas, dan perak. Perangkat ini hadir dengan bodi bongsor yang dimensi meliputi panjang 156.2 mm, lebar 77.3 mm, dan ketebalan 7.6 mm. Sedangkan, untuk bobot Xiaomi Mi Note 2 sendiri adalah 166 gram yang tentu wajar untuk perangkat kategori phablet. Sementara pada bagian visualnya di bekali dengan panel AMOLED dengan bentang 5.7 inci. Layar ini mampu menghasilkan resolusi Full HD 1080 x 1920 piksel dengan kerapatan 386 ppi. Layar Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini sudah dioptimalkan dengan proteksi Corning Gorilla Glass 4 sehingga lebih tahan terhadap goresan dan benturan. Tampilannya pun terlihat makin menarik sebab menggunakan sistem antarmuka MIUI 8.0. Kehadiran sensor fingerprint di bagian belakang bodinya juga semakin melengkapi spesifikasi Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini.. Dapur Pacu Gahar Berkat Chipset Snapdragon 821 dan RAM 4 GB /6 GB. Setelah mengulas bagian fisiknya, sekarang kita akan beralih untuk mengulas bagian permesinan dari spesifikasi Xiaomi Mi Note 2. Salah satu peningkatan yang diberikan oleh Xiaomi pada sektor dapur pacu adalah dengan menghadirkan chipset baru Qualcomm MSM8996 Snapdragon 821 untuk mendukung olah data yang lebih kencang sebab performanya lebih tinggi 10 persen dibandingkan dengan Snapdragon 820. Chip yang tersemat pada Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini mampu menghasilkan prosesor empat inti hasil konfigurasi dari Dual-core 2.35 GHz Kryo dan Dual-core 1.6 GHz Kryo. Peningkatan lain juga diberikan pada bekalan RAMnya, sebab suksesor Xiaomi Mi Note ini hadir dengan dua varian RAM berukuran besar, yaitu 4 GB dan 6 GB yang tentu akan sanggup melibas aktivitas multitasking tanpa hambatan. Untuk urusan gaming dan multimedia, Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini mengandalkan kartu grafis Adreno 530 yang menyuguhkan konten visual berkualitas tinggi. Disisi lain sistem operasi Android v6.0 Marshmallow dengan kinerja cepat dan responsif serta segudang fitur baru akan mendukung kinerja komponen yang tersemat pada spesifikasi Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini.. Ruang Simpan Data Sediakan 2 Varian Memori Internal Berukuran Besar. Pada bagian ini, kita akan mengulas mengenai ruang penyimpanan atau storage yang dimiliki pada spesifikasi Xiaomi Mi Note 2. Xiaomi sepertinya memang cukup memperhatikan urusan ruang simpan data dari para pengguna ponsel ini. Bisa dilihat bagaimana phablet barunya ini menawarkan dua varian memori internal sebesar 64 GB dan 128 GB. Dengan kapasitas memori internal yang besar itu, tentu pengguna Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini akan bisa menyimpan file sistem maupun file hiburan koleksinya sendiri dengan leluasa. Sayangnya, Xiaomi tak mendesain perangkatnya ini dengan slot microSD sehingga ekspansi ruang penyimpanannya pun menjadi terbatasi. Absennya slot memori eksternal ini tentu menjadi salah satu sisi minus dari Xiaomi Mi Note 2, namun tampaknya hal ini tak begitu masalah bagi sebagian besar pengguna sebab memori yang tersedia pun sudah sangat besar. Nah, dari sektor penyimpanan ini nampaknya spesifikasi Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini dapat dikatakan memadai.. Lini Fotografi Canggih Bersenjatakan Kamera 22,5 MP dan 8 MP. Selanjutnya Begawei akan mengajak sobat untuk mengulas lini fotografi dari spesifikasi Xiaomi Mi Note 2 yang sangat mumpuni. Pasalnya, perangkat ini menghadirkan dua buah piranti kamera berkualitas tinggi untuk memanjakan para penggunanya. Lihat saja kamera utama beresolusi 22,5 MP dengan aperture f/2.0 yang menghiasi bagian punggung Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini. Kamera ini pun sudah dilengkapi dengan fitur EIS (gyro), phase detection autofocus, dan dual-LED flash. Kamera tersebut juga mampu menghasilkan dua varian video, yaitu [email. protected] Sementara itu, di bagian depan bodi dari Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini tersemat kamera sekunder beresolusi 8 MP yang sudah sangat mendukung sobat Begawei yang hobi berselfie ria serta mengakses video call. Selain sensor size sejumlah fitur pendukung kamera seperti geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR, dan panorama juga turut melengkapi spesifikasi Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini.. Spesifikasi Smartphone Xiaomi Mi Note 2. Akses Internet Super Cepat dengan Jaringan 4G LTE Cat 12. Untuk mendukung kebutuhan akses para penggunanya, spesifikasi Xiaomi Mi Note 2 pada bagian konektivitas sudah dibekali dengan teknologi terbaik yang ada pada saat ini. Tak hanya mendukung akses internet super cepat saja, tetapi handset ini juga mendukung kebutuhan komunikasi yang lebih efisien seperti dengan menghadirkan fitur dual SIM. Dibalik akses internet dari Xiaomi Mi Note 2 yang super cepat dan stabil ternyata ada teknologi jaringan 4G LTE Cat 12 yang diklaim mendukung unduh data berkecepatan 600 Mbps dan unggah data berkecepatan 150 Mbps. Sedangkan untuk daerah yang belum terjangkau 4G LTE, Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini juga masih mendukung jaringan lama seperti GSM dan HSPA. Fitur seperti Wi-fi dan hotspot yang tersedia pun bisa dimanfaatkan untuk mendapatkan koneksi internet secara gratis. Sementara untuk urusan pengiriman data, pengguna bisa mengandalkan Bluetooth v4.2, A2DP, LE dan type-C 1.0 reversible connector. Pada sistem navigasinya, spesifikasi Xiaomi Mi Note 2 sudah dibekali dengan teknologi A-GPS, GLONASS, dan BDS sehingga kemampuan navigasinya memiliki akurasi yang tinggi.. Nah, setelah mengulas beberapa sektor pada spesifikasi Xiaomi Mi Note 2 selanjutnya Begawei akan mengulas sektor pemasok daya yang akan menopang kerja semua komponen pada spesifikasi phablet Xiaomi ini. Di jaman modern seperti sekarang ini, tentu sudah jadul rasanya jika sobat Begawei membawa smartphone yang gampang low-bat. Untuk menghindari hal ini, Xiaomi Mi Note 2 dibekali dengan pemasok daya yang cukup gahar yaitu baterai Lithium Ion berkapasitas 4.070 mAH. Kapasitas ini tentu sudah sangat menunjang operasional yang dijalankannya. Dengan kapasitas yang besar itu, baterai pun akan lebih tahan lama. Meski jenis baterai yang dipakai Xiaomi Mi Note 2 merupakan baterai tanam sehingga tidak bisa dilepas, namun sektor ini telah dibekali dengan teknologi Quick Charge 3.0 yang mampu digunakan untuk mengisi daya sebesar 83 % hanya dalam waktu 30 menit. Nah setelah membaca spesifikasi Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini apakah sobat sudah penasaran dengan harganya?. Xiaomi memang dikenal sebagai vendor smartphone yang selalu mengeluarkan produk dengan kualitas baik. Tak terkecuali pada Xiaomi Mi Note 2 yang merupakan generasi penerus dari Xiaomi Mi Note yang diluncurkan 2015 lalu. Dengan berbekal spesifikasi yang mumpuni generasi penerus Mi Note ini akan menjadi andalan Xiaomi dalam mempertahankan eksistensinya di pasar smartphone global. Hal ini dapat dibuktikan dengan beberapa komponen canggih yang disematkan pada Xiaomi Mi Note 2 seperti kamera yang nampaknya akan menjadi andalan perangkat ini dalam menggoda calon konsumennya. Pasalnya, dengan kamera utama berkekuatan 22.5 MP dan kamera sekundernya yang memiliki kekuatan 8 MP tentu akan menjadi kelebihan bagi Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini. Ditambah lagi layar AMOLED seluas 5.7 inci yang siap menampilkan tampilan visual dengan dukungan GPU Adreno 530 tentu membuatnya tampak memukau. Ditambah lagi layar super cantik tersebut telah dilengkapi dengan proteksi Corning Gorilla Glass 4 yang akan membuatnya aman dari goresan. Namun disisi lain Xiaomi Mi Note 2 nampaknya tidak dibekali dengan slot micro SD sehingga sobat Begawei hanya bisa menggunakan memori internal untuk menyimpan file-file milik sobat. Selain itu, baterai yang dibekalkan Xiaomi pada perangkat ini adalah baterai tanam sehingga pengguna tidak bisa melepasnya sewaktu-waktu jika dibutuhkan. Nah, itulah tadi beberapa hal yang perlu dicatat dari kelebihan Xiaomi Mi Note 2 dan kekurangan Xiaomi Mi Note 2.. Setelah puas membedah spesifikasinya, tiba saatnya kita pada segmen yang akan membahas mengenai harga Xiaomi Mi Note 2. Namun sebelum lebih jauh mengulas mengenai angka yang akan disemaatkan pada banderol harganya, mari kita simpulkan hal-hal yang menjadi daya tarik untuk perangfkat ini. Pertama, sektor visual dan dapur pacu merupakan salah satu contoh yang menjadi daya tarik dari perangkat ini. Pasalnya, Xiaomi Mi Note 2 membawa panel AMOLED dengan bentang 5.7 inci yang tentu bakal menyuguhkan tampilan yang maksimal. Sementara itu bagian dapur pacunya mengandalkan chipset terbaru Qualcomm Snapdragon 821. Harga Xiaomi Mi Note 2 nantinya juga akan dipengaruhi oleh dua varian RAM dengan kapasitas 4 GB dan 6 GB yang membuat performanya tentu lebih mumpuni. Lalu berapakah harga Xiaomi Mi Note 2 untuk setiap unitnya?. Harga Xiaomi Mi Note 2 Terbaru. Jika mempertimbangkan spesifikasinya yang dipenuhi dengan komponen dan fitur-fitur berkualitas tinggi tentu saja harga Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini tak akan murah. Seperti yang sudah Begawei sampaikan diatas harga pasaran perangkat ini juga dipengaruhi oleh bekalan RAM yang disematkan ke padanya. Sehingga nominal harga yang tersedia di pasar tanah air pun juga hadir dalam dua varian. Untuk harga Xiaomi Mi Note 2 yang dibekali dengan RAM 6 GB ternyata dibanderol pada kisaran Rp 9 hingga 10 jutaan. Namun, jika sobat Begawei menghendaki perangkat yang sama dengan harga yang lebih terjangkau, maka sebaiknya memilih Xiaomi Mi Note 2 dengan RAM 4 GB. Pasalanya, banderol harga phablet ini hanya berada di kisaran Rp 4 hingga 5 jutaan. Nah, dengan harga tersebut nampaknya perangkat ini memang masuk pada kategori gadget mahal, namun harga Xiaomi Mi Note 2 yang mahal tersebut tentu bukan tanpa alasan.. Selain nominal harga Xiaomi Mi Note 2 yang Begawei sampaikan diatas, harga jual perangkat ini di Indonesia juga bisa bervariasi tergantung toko atau e-commerce yang menjualnya sebab banyak di antara mereka yang memberikan diskon dengan jumlah yang berbeda-beda sehingga harganya lebih murah. Harga Xiaomi Mi Note 2 tersebut memang bisa dikatakan mahal namun kualitas yang akan didapatkan pengguna tentu sepadan mengingat spesifikasi yang diusungnya pun dipenuhi dengan komponen-komponen nomor wahid. Meski harga dari Xiaomi Mi Note 2 ini lumayan mahal namun tentu hal ini tetap tak menjadi masalah besar terutama bagi mereka yang memang menghendaki handset premium dengan spesifikasi istimewa. Nah, dengan bekalan spesifikasi tersebut apakah sobat tertarik untuk memilikinya? Demikian ulasan Begawei mengenai spesifikasi dan harga Xiaomi Mi Note 2. Semoga spesifikasi tersebut dapat bermanfaat bagi sobat semua. Jangan lupa baca juga ulasan menarik lainnya mengenaiÂ. GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 - SIM 1 & SIM 2.

December 9, 2017 at 1:32 pm. hey muhammad which country from you are ???. December 10, 2017 at 11:20 am. Pozdrav iz Beograda! Upravo sam prodao savoj redmi 4X pa sam u dilemi da li da kupim ovaj, honor9 ili nešto drugo. Zvuk preko slušaalica mi je jedna bitna stavka, izgleda da je to po tvom mišljenju super, tako da praktično ovaj fon i nema neke mane. Sve je tu, dobar ekran, baterija, zvuk, szablizacija slike sa dual kamerom, i da ne zaboravimo dizajn, prelep je! Meni ne smeta što nema pooseban slot za memoriju(koristim 2 kartice), jer je 64gb sasvim dovoljno. Šta bi ti pre uzeo, ovaj ili honor 9, ili nešto srugo za oko 300e?? pozdrav!.
