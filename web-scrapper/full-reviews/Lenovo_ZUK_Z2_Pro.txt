Pros: ZUK Z2 Pro è un ottimo prodotto e il vero motivo che lo rende meno \"brillante\" rispetto allo scorso anno è in sostanza il software, ancora troppo \"asiatico\" (l\'anno scorso c\'era invece Cyanogen nel mezzo!). Se però sapete dove mettere le mani questo Z2 Pro è uno degli smartphone più interessanti, anche per la sua qualità costruttiva e le sue dimensioni \"contenute\". Cons: Il software è pensato per l\'Asia Dovrete perdere tempo con Play Store, lingua italiana e app Messa a fuoco lenta Niente NFC. Is this helpful? Yes ( 0 ) No ( 0 ).

MUHAMMAD, 24 Jan 2018 sir i have purchased zuk z2 pro in 2016, now i want to it extend it to nougat 7.0 or 7.1, so, ... As of 1/24/2018, Lenovo ZUK Z2 Pro in China has been updated to Oreo and won't leave there as of this time, and the stable release follows a beta testing phase that started in November 2017. Usually it's 2-3 months later after China to have global stable ROM released just like P2 and Zuk Z2. This software release comes with a new UI design, including for calls and text messages, a new Security Center with built-in Blacklist feature, a new U Health app, and a "Personal calendar" function. Additionally, many bugs have been fixed - things that impacted the volume rocker adjustment, loudspeaker, mobile data, media sharing, and battery power saving optimization with apps.. sir i have purchased zuk z2 pro in 2016, now i want to it extend it to nougat 7.0 or 7.1, so, how can i upgrade it..

I had that issue a few months ago. Really frustrating! Take a look at the ZUK Fans Europe site: there's quite a few threads talking about it there.. MRDA, 01 Jan 2018 As long as you flash the 1.9 version of the stock ROM, you should receive OTA updates. Hi, do you know why this time(on my brother zuk z2 pro), the official ZUI 1.9.104 ST wont update? says no upgrade is available, i have already checked that the bootloader is lock. KK111, 14 Dec 2017 Some you can upgrade to 7.0. It mrans it dhould support OTA. more As long as you flash the 1.9 version of the stock ROM, you should receive OTA updates.. Some you can upgrade to 7.0. It mrans it dhould support OTA. emincfc, 01 Dec 2017 Does this phone get upgrade to android 8? Via AEX custom ROMs, yes. The alpha versions show promise in regard to camera quality, introducing API2 compatibility to the device. You can get stunning images via the Google camera mods!. Does this phone get upgrade to android 8?. Jim, 17 Oct 2017 I would go for Lenovo ZUK Z2 Pro 128GB variant as it's cheaper than the 128GB variant of Mi5S ... more What flashable camera blobs are you talking about?. GeekyNerd, 03 Oct 2017 If you were to choose between the two, based on the hardware speculations, which one would you... more I would go for Lenovo ZUK Z2 Pro 128GB variant as it's cheaper than the 128GB variant of Mi5S Plus, other than that reason I ain't a big fan of MIUI, ZUK has a large developer support so I can always replace its ROM with the official AOSPExtended ROM. And once flashed with Darkmoon Kernel it easily outruns Mi5S Plus in terms of performance. As for camera performance on custom ROMs, well ZUK devices are the only devices with camera blobs readily available as flashable zip, so no problem in case of camera quality on custom ROMs either.. GeekyNerd, 03 Oct 2017 If you were to choose between the two, based on the hardware speculations, which one would you... GeekyNerd, 03 Oct 2017 If you were to choose between the two, based on the hardware speculations, which one would you... more ZUK Z2 Pro for the better size (I prefer a phone I can use single-handed) and also for the fact that it has all the European LTE bands. Specs don't seem radically different otherwise, apart from the bigger battery capacity on the Xiaomi.. Ignoring the fact that the 128 GB version of Mi 5s Plus is almost twice as expensive as the Zuk Z2 Pro, I'd take it. Now I just need to find someone to pay the difference ;-). If you were to choose between the two, based on the hardware speculations, which one would you pick? Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus or ZUK Z2 Pro? Please answer :).

I've managed on how to install this rom with gapps properly and i've got first problem - during usage it stucks with blue led... I force rebooted it a few times and now it works, but the most in-demand feature is customization of utouch... Hope this will be added in future thanks for this alpha version!.

My Devices: LG G Watch , ZTE Axon 7. So here is the list of issues which i found and which aren't mentioned in the first post:. - no utouch customization (i think it's just because of alpha so not big deal). - stucks with blue led when overheated (biggest problem IMO, it's just randomly goes off with blue led and nothing wakes it up except force reboot). - random crashes of settings app, launcher and systemui a few times. - some apps can't update themselves through play store. -no charging indication after a few minutes of charging (it's showing that device is on battery but keeps charging and raising percentage, so not big deal too). -play store stutters when clicking on install/update. Thanks for such big work on oreo, it's really great that this build is pretty usable even in alpha stage! I hope this will not be forgotten.

Q: How is the built-in speaker for music compared to the Xiaomi Mi5? A: I have compared them side by side, and the Z2 Pro in fact has a louder and better speaker (more clear for music) than the Xiaomi Mi5. I would say about 10% louder and better.

Lenovo ZUK Z2 Pro debuts with up to 6GB RAM, a grand total of 10 health sensors. Adrian Diaconescu April 21, 2016 6:54 am. While mobile consumers on the Western hemisphere probably regard Motorola as the most appealing brand in Lenovo’s portfolio, folks over in China may start to consider ZUK a robust alternative to local veterans like Huawei, Xiaomi or Meizu with the launch of the Z2 Pro.. This is so much bolder than ZUK’s affordable but hardly trend-setting 2015 Z1 rookie , daring to go where no Android handheld has gone before, with official iCloud support out the box. Wait, does Apple even know about that?. No idea yet, though there are many other original propositions made by the Lenovo ZUK Z2 Pro, including a hefty range of 10 health sensors, a top-shelf 6GB RAM configuration, and 3D, as opposed to 2.5D, “floating glass design.”. No reason you should pair the just-announced 5.2-incher with an activity tracker, since it can measure blood oxygen levels, your heart rate, and UV radiation all by its lonesome. It also recognizes fingerprints in 0.1 seconds, and starts with 4 gigs of memory if you want to save a few bucks or deem the 6GB model overkill.. Under the hood, you of course got a Snapdragon 820 processor ticking, and respectably large Quick Charge 3.0-enabled 3,100 mAh battery keeping the lights on, presumably for a long time, as the Z2 Pro’s display settles for frugal 1080p resolution.. What else? Well, the horizontal screen bezels are far from ideal, and we wouldn’t call the 13 and 8MP cameras top-notch either, but some compromises were mandated by Lenovo’s wish to sell the 6GB RAM/128GB ROM ZUK Z2 Pro at the measly equivalent of $415 in China starting tomorrow, April 22. With 4G LTE connectivity, obviously, a USB 3.1 Type-C port, and ZUI-skinned Android 6.0 Marshmallow pre-loaded. That’s how a startup gets noticed in a universe dominated by “old-timers.”.

Lenovo Zuk Z2 and Z2 Pro get Android Oreo beta. The Lenovo ZUK Z2 and Z2 Pro have received Oreo betas, which is an impressive feat as both were launched on Marshmallow and got updates to Nougat months after. Too bad there's little to no chance the world will ever see a ZUK Z3.. by Ricci Rox , 2017/12/17.

While most of the major brands trudge along on the road to Oreo, there's a surprising aspirant in the guise of Lenovo, as users of the company's Z2 and Z2 Pro in China have confirmed receipt of an Oreo beta.. Lenovo established the ZUK brand as a means of offering devices for heavy users at highly competitive price points. In a similar fashion to the now-dead LeEco, the brand went under after producing just two generations of devices. There was word a while back that indicated the possibility of another generation of phones but nothing came of it, so it's safe to assume we won't be getting a Lenovo ZUK Z3.. The ZUK Z2 Pro getting is quite impressive, as it was released in May 2016, on Marshmallow, and got the update to Nougat when the version of the OS was launched. Two major, timely updates are already more than most OEMs can boast of providing. The devices had their issues, no doubt, but this is still worthy of recognition..
